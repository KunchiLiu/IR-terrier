	<brief_summary>The overarch aim trial evaluate naltrexone 's efficacy light genetic variation brain response alcohol cue utilize neuroimaging paradigm . This trial four specific aim . First , trial evaluate whether presence OPRM1 Asp40 allele substitution associate improved treatment response naltrexone treatment-seeking alcoholic . Second , evaluate whether difference naltrexone dampen alcohol cue-induced brain activation dependent OPRM1 genotype . Third , explore whether alcohol cue-induced brain activation dampen naltrexone might mediate factor treatment effect naltrexone , OPRM1 gene , interaction might observe first aim . Finally , trial evaluate effect medication compliance , adverse effect , observed medication genotype treatment response . A secondary aim measure medication compliance side effect base OPRM1 genotype .</brief_summary>
