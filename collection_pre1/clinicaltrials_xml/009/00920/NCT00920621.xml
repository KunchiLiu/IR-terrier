	<brief_title>Randomized Trial : Maternal Vitamin D Supplementation Prevent Childhood Asthma ( VDAART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma one lead cause morbidity child 60 % case diagnose age 3 . Thus , find factor lead prevention disease would great public health importance . Vitamin D deficiency highly prevalent among pregnant woman , thus , represent potentially modifiable factor prevention disease . Due effect vitamin D modulate immune response , believe vitamin D deficiency pregnant mother lead faulty immune system development neonate , predispose asthma allergy . We observational data two independent birth cohort study higher maternal intake vitamin D pregnancy independently associate 50 % reduction risk recurrent wheeze asthma 3- 5-yr old child . However , order recommend universal treatment prevent asthma , randomize , control , clinical trial necessary . Therefore , propose two arm , double-blind , placebo control , randomize , clinical trial Vitamin D , determine whether high vitamin D intake level pregnant mother prevent asthma allergy child age 3 . We identify pregnant woman asthma allergy whose partner asthma allergy , obstetric clinic three clinical center participate trial . We recruit 870 pregnant woman first trim pregnancy randomize one two treatment arm 4-year clinical trial : 4000 IU Vitamin D addition usual prenatal vitamin , n=435 ; usual prenatal vitamin alone , n=435 . Our primary specific aim determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation pregnant mother associate reduce incidence asthma child first 3 year life . The sub-aims study include ( 1 ) To determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation pregnant mother associate reduce secondary outcome child ( ) allergic sensitization , ( b ) doctor 's diagnosis eczema ( c ) low respiratory tract infection first 3 year life ; ( 2 ) To determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation pregnant mother associate improved vitamin D status mother offspring measurement 25 ( OH ) D level maternal plasma , cord blood , child 's blood 1 3 yr age ( 3 ) To determine whether sufficient vitamin D supplementation pregnant mother associate reduce incidence preterm birth ( birth &lt; 37 week gestation ) , preeclampsia , gestational hypertension , and/or Hemolytic anemia , Elevated Liver enzyme , Low Platelet count ( HELLP syndrome ) ( PB/PE ) compare usual care control group VDAART . VDAART Analysis Plan ( Addendum Protocol ) All analysis primary secondary outcome state VDAART Protocol perform use intent-to-treat ( ITT ) paradigm , unless specifically state . I . Definition outcomes . A . Asthma recurrent wheezing . The primary outcome trial development doctor 's diagnosis asthma and/or recurrent wheeze . While asthma acknowledge root early life , make definite diagnosis difficult child older , wheeze illness may precursors asthma diagnosis . Thus , composite definition primary outcome . - Asthma define parent 's report physician 's diagnosis time first three year life , base questionnaire response . For time-to-event analysis , time incident asthma determine time first positive questionnaire response . - Recurrent wheezing define least one report wheeze third year life plus report wheeze first two year life . Recognizing wheeze symptom may modify medication use , variable age onset , variable , follow include composite outcome : - child least one wheeze episode ( 1st 2 year life ) , plus asthma controller medication ( define steroid inhaler nebulizer OR steroid pill liquids OR leukotriene modifier ) third year - child report wheeze first 2 year report 2 separate episode wheeze third year OR controller medication ( define ) least 2 separate report third year OR least 1 report wheeze least 1 separate report controller medication use third year For recurrent wheezing ( wheeze phenotype ) , time incident recurrent wheeze determine time first report wheezing , time-to-event analysis . In event child meet definition base solely use controller medication , first report use controller medication use determine time onset wheeze time-to-event analysis . For outcome , question ask every 3 month , recognize miss questionnaire occur , event time treat interval-censored . B. Eczema . Eczema define positive response parent 's report physician 's diagnosis time first three year life base questionnaire response . C. Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRI ) . Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRIs ) define base parental response questionnaire . LRIs define parental report physician 's diagnosis pneumonia , bronchiolitis , bronchitis , croup ( laryngotracheobronchitis ) . LRIs may occur multiple time three-year period child . Information repeat episode LRI employ rate estimation comparison . D. Total specific IgE . Total specific serum IgE measure cord blood sample , year 3 sample child . Total IgE analyze continuous outcome . Sensitization define specific IgE ≥ 0.35 IU . II . Secondary Analyses . A . Analyses base level . Secondary analysis use baseline follow-up maternal 25OHD level perform . We investigate effect baseline follow-up maternal level separately development primary secondary outcome trial . Additionally , categorize mother category base joint baseline follow-up level . Mothers baseline level follow-up level ≥ 40 mg/dl categorize HI-HI group ; baseline level follow-up level &lt; 40 mg/dl categorize LO-LO group ; mother meet definition categorize either HI-LO LO-HI group base baseline follow-up level .</detailed_description>
