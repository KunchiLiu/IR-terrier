	<brief_summary>Adult intracranial ependymoma relatively rare brain tumour entity , account 2-5 % intracranial neoplasm . The pertinent prognostic factor well pattern recurrence remain elucidate . According several recent report , prognostic value Karnofski performance status , tumour location , extent surgical removal , histological grade even postoperative radiotherapy remain controversial . As consequence , optimal therapeutic management adult intracranial ependymomas remain ongoing debate . For reason , retrospective study conduct French society neurosurgery ( SFNC ) , neuropathology ( SFNP ) association neuro-oncologists French expression ( ANOCEF ) undertake allow collect 258 case come 25 center , initially diagnose intracranial ependymomas 1990 2004 . Clinical follow-up data patient know paraffin embed sample well frozen tissue available centralize . Central pathological review 258 case conduct two senior neuropathologists confirm diagnosis ependymoma 152 case , thus constitute important series literature . Few molecular study carry ependymomas . The investigator opportunity , base important series , determine clinicopathological criterion molecular marker allow good characterization diagnosis prognosis tumor .</brief_summary>
