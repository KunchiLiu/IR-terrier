	<brief_summary>In pediatric anesthesia pediatric intensive care , tracheal intubation one important procedure . To achieve procedure fast possible best condition , physician choose head posture priori enable first best glottic visualisation laryngoscopy , second facilitate route tube larynx trachea . Tracheal intubation procedure use year , many textbook recommendation best head posture tracheal intubation paediatrics make . Briefly summarize , depend age child , head ( ) slightly extend , pillow ( ) position occiput . These recommendation questionable three major reason : - despite apparent consensus , recommendation quite different . - none base anatomical clinical study - , age child consider critical point , child grossly categorize three category ( newborn , infant old child ) . And clinician way , face child , make choice dichotomic attitude . Actually , response question need rigourous clinical study laryngoscopy , hard design difficult make . P.Adnet et coll . ( Anesthesiology 2001 ) show anatomical study resonance magnetic imaging ( MRI ) bring indirect strong evidence first step lead clinical study . Many child need MRI study different reason , fast easy get examination additional image superior airway . In unit , investigator experience kind study , recently publish ( Pediatric Anesthesia 2008 ) MRI study demonstrate child , head extension improve alignment visualisation axis laryngeal axis , worsen alignment pharyngeal axis laryngeal axis . However , patient include study major part infant , influence age could properly analyze . Morevover , study suffer two main limitation , lack standardisation head posture , laryngeal mask child , general anesthesia ( require MRI examination ) make use laryngeal mask ( time standard institution ) . The investigator propose MRI study influence age consequence head extension anatomic ax superior airway child , prospective stratify age study . Several modification improvement design study would diminish limitation first study .</brief_summary>
