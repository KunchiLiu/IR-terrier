	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study find high tolerate dose study drug : capecitabine , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab , dasatinib give combination subject advance solid tumor . This occur first part study ( Phase I ) . Once dose determine , give subject advance metastatic colorectal cancer second part study ( Phase II ) . By give drug combination , researcher hope evaluate side effect study drug group , determine combination could possibly decrease stabilize cancer treat . Subjects enrol Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) Rocky Mountain Cancer Center . After satisfy eligibility screen criterion , patient treat 21 day cycle . ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS - Capecitabine ( Xeloda™ ) oral ( take mouth ) chemotherapy drug tablet form make Roche Laboratories Inc. Capecitabine approve use Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) first line treatment ( treatment use cancer treat yet ) metastatic colorectal cancer also metastatic breast cancer . - Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin™ ) intravenous ( give injection vein ) chemotherapy drug make Sanofi-Synthélabo . This drug also approve FDA use metastatic colorectal cancer . - Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) type intravenous cancer treatment call anti-angiogenic therapy ( type therapy treat cancer interfere blood flow tumor , thereby stop tumor growth , possibly lead tumor shrinkage ) make Genentech Inc. Bevacizumab approve FDA first line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer combination chemotherapy . - Dasatinib ( Sprycel™ ) oral drug make Bristol Myers Squib , Inc ( BMS ) . Dasatinib approve FDA treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient resistant medicine call imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec™ ) .</brief_summary>
