	<brief_summary>Obstructive airway disease common condition . This condition include patient asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , emphysema chronic bronchitis . Some patient obstructive airway disease problem long term breathlessness , wheeze cough without sputum production . Currently researcher give treatment - usually inhaler - design open airway reduce breathlessness wheeze . Despite available treatment many patient still continue symptom . Anecdotal clinical evidence suggest herbal remedy ( call AKL1 ) beneficial effect respiratory condition , patient diagnose asthma COPD reporting reduce symptom include breathlessness cough reduce frequency attacks.The purpose study confirm whether AKL1 indeed meaningful benefit patient obstructive airway disease . The researcher mainly measure effect AKL assess change trial subject ' cough , use questionnaire , researcher also look breathe test , walk test , blood sputum test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With AKL1 Obstructive Airways Disease ( The TAKL Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The outcome care obstructive airway disease UK country fail meet guideline target , high level avoidable morbidity avoidable mortality . Obstructive lung disease encompass term condition include patient reversible ( asthma ) non reversible ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) component lung function . AKL1 novel pharmaceutical agent derive combination botanical product develop treatment obstructive lung disease ( asthma COPD ) . The botanical product contain synthetically-derived phytochemical component Picrorrhiza kurroa , apocynin , together standardized extract Picrorrhiza kurroa , Zingiber officinale Ginkgo biloba previously market health food supplement . Recent evidence suggest Ginkgo biloba reduces inflammatory ( protein kinase C positive ie eosinophil neutrophil ) cell induced sputum give addition inhale corticosteroid asthmatic patient . Anecdotal clinical evidence suggest botanical product significant activity respiratory condition , patient diagnose obstructive lung disease ( asthma COPD ) reporting reduce symptom include breathlessness cough , reduce frequency attack , reduce dependence bronchodilator ability reduce inhaled corticosteroid dose . We complete pilot study investigate efficacy safety AKL1 'add-on ' therapy adult patient diagnose obstructive lung disease whose symptom remain uncontrolled standard medication . Whilst significant difference lung function , trend clinical improvement patient-centered outcome e.g . cough , health status exacerbation frequency . Hence large adequately power study need investigate outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female , age 18 80 year , inclusive The patient receive verbal write study information , question answer satisfactorily consent form personally sign dated patient investigator A diagnosis obstructive lung disease ( reference International Primary Care Respiratory Group ( IPCRG ) Guidelines ) ( 4 ) . This evidence post bronchodilator ratio FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 Visit 1 2 The patient post bronchodilator FEV1 great 40 % le 80 % Visit 1 2 Patients history regular sputum production ( &gt; 3 day per week ) LCQ score &lt; 17 ( high score indicate improvement ) . A MRC dyspnoea score 3 Females must post menopausal ( &gt; 1 year ) , surgically sterilise use adequate hormonal contraception , intrauterine device ) , breast feeding negative serum pregnancy test The patient must satisfactory health exception obstructive lung disease determine investigator basis medical history physical examination In Investigator 's judgement , patient able willing comply study visit procedure ( include laboratory test , lung function test ) . Subjects must able demonstrate ability use salbutamol MDI screening period The patient currently poorly control disease define require course oral parenteral corticosteroid exacerbation obstructive lung disease three month prior Visit 2 . The patient recent change maintenance therapy ( i.e . within 6 week ) Maintenance oral corticosteroid treatment use unlicensed dos inhale corticosteroid medication ( &gt; 2000mcg beclomethasone diproprionate/ day equivalent ) The patient seasonal disease alone The patient know laboratory abnormality , opinion investigator , would contraindicate study participation , include , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) greater/equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL The patient unable discontinue shortacting beta2adrenergic agonist least 4 hour , longacting beta agonist ( 12 hour ) tiotropium ( 24 hour ) prior Visit 2 ( Week 0 ) The patient chronic heart failure class III IV ( New York Heart Association ) recent ( less six month ) history stroke , transient ischemic attack myocardial infarction The patient able follow study procedure ( e.g. , language problem , psychological disorder ) consider noncompliant accord investigator . The patient history know alcohol substance abuse ( exclude cigarette ) within oneyear prior Visit 1 The patient active malignancy type history malignancy ( exception patient malignancy surgically remove evidence recurrence within five year enrolment , patient history treat basal cell carcinoma ) The patient severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Subjects malignancy currently undergo radiation therapy chemotherapy within 5 year . The patient difficulty swallow capsule tablet , dysphagia unable tolerate oral medication The patient previously admit study currently participate recently participate another trial investigational drug within 90 day start study .</criteria>
