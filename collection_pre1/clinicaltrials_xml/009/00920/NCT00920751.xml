	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1 . Study method achieves lower requirement medication 2 . Study method increase overall cecal intubation comparable assessment current experience patient willingness repeat future colonoscopy compare conventional colonoscopy 3 . Study method result reduction medication-related ( cardiorespiratory ) complication , fast turn around patient , compare conventional colonoscopy 4 . Study method improves bowel preparation increase polyp pickup rate Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen high low risk healthy asymptomatic VA patient promote ( VHA directive ) . Compliance Directive result increase number VA patient undergo colonoscopy . The demand colonoscopy far exceed capacity available perform procedure VA system . The conventional practice colonoscopy VA facility across country perform colonoscopy conscious sedation air insufflation . Efficiency govern fact sedate patient require time space recovery major limit factor current setting use colonoscopy CRC screening . Methods maintain high success rate good patient assessment improve overall compliance surveillance colonoscopy . Our preliminary experience show patient able complete successful colonoscopy without sedation 52 % case colonoscopy aided water infusion lieu air insufflation method . In group patient , shorten recovery time mean quick turn around patient efficient endoscopy service . Patients able communicate good staff physician regarding problem discharge instruction , subject amnesic effect sedation . Next day follow-up patient telephone contact require commitment staff time obviate . If randomize study confirm success preliminary finding technique adopt endoscopists , large number VA patient may benefit less sedation complication time allow efficient colonoscopy screening service .</brief_summary>
