	<brief_title>Overnight Weight Loss Sleep Structure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss cause loss body mass due metabolism water loss insensible water loss , sweat , excretion feces urine . Eighty-three percent total weight loss due insensible water loss airways skin . Water loss rate varies accord change activity ambient temperature humidity . Although weight loss sleep well-known phenomenon , study relate sleep structure function distinct sleep stage , particularly SWS REM sleep . There evidence suggest homeostatic mechanism weight control animal model human . This mechanism think dependent energy intake , energy expenditure , environmental condition . The literature suggest sleep important weight homeostasis long term since sleep shortage associate overweight status , overnight weight variation yet study . Considering fact , hypothesize overnight weight loss rate uniform throughout sleep period . We also intend compare weight loss rate sleep awake rest . Intervention : Normal obese volunteer undergo whole night polysomnography continuous body weight temperature register adaptation night . After , volunteer remain awake rest bed follow day continuous weight temperature register .</detailed_description>
