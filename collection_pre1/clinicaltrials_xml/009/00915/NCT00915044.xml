	<brief_title>Interactions Between Immune Cells Intestinal Mucosa Peripheral Blood With Extracellular Matrix Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Inflammatory bowel disease , comprise Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) idiopathic disorder cause due immunological , genetic , environmental factor . These disorder fairly common ( US , 11 case CD 7 case UC every 100,000 people ) . The frequency IBD , especially CD , constantly rise ( 1 ) . Clinical symptom include diarrhea , rectal bleeding , abdominal pain , intestinal obstruction , fistulas CD . There also systemic manifestation fever , weight loss , anemia . The current hypothesis IBD pathogenesis aberrant , ongoing , uncontrolled inflammatory response intestine , cause commensal microbiota . The inflammatory response IBD mediate T cell ; CD pathologic lymphocytes CD4 cell Th1 type , UC consider atypical Th2 response ( 2 ) . CD4 T cell major role initiation inflammatory response gut , well role propagation control inflammation . Chemokines low-molecular weight cytokine chemoattractant capacity , role many inflammatory disorder . The chemokine CXCL12 consider constitutively express ( 3 ) . Our group find increase expression CXCL12 IBD ( REF ? ) . This finding suggest CXCL12 might role inflammatory process gut . Understanding phenotypical functional difference lymphocytes mucosal homeostasis IBD , elucidation factor cause difference , recognition cause increase CXCL12 expression , enable increase knowledge IBD ; well lead development future therapeutic intervention IBD . Research Goals : To examine effect different environmental factor ( cytokine , chemokines , extracellular matrix moiety ) immune cell peripheral intestinal source ( homeostasis IBD ) term phenotypical functional parameter . Methods : 15 ml peripheral blood obtain participant . T lymphocytes isolated different experiment . Methods include : Migration towards chemokines use Transwell assay , proliferation assess either BrdU thymidine incorporation , cytokine secretion determine use ELISA , phenotypical characterization do use flow cytometry adhesion assay . Ages : Adults child age 10-80 . Research group : Approximately 40 patient ( adults child ) suffer IBD enrol . Control group : Approximately 100 control enrol research .</detailed_description>
