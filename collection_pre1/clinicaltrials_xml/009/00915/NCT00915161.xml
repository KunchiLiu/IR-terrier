	<brief_summary>Collections fluid around lung ( pleural effusion ) common patient mechanical ventilation . Long stays mechanical ventilation lead serious complication pneumonia associate significant morbidity mortality . The drainage pleural effusion may lead improvement oxygenation make easy discontinue mechanical ventilation . The purpose study examine effect thoracocentesis ( pleural fluid drainage ) blood oxygenation 48 hour period see whether effect sustain therefore helpful discontinuation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This collection data patient decide attend clinician pleural drainage would beneficial . Ultrasound use confirm presence pleural effusion estimate size pleural effusion confirm position pleural drain . Data collect drainage , 30 minute drainage 4,8,12 24 hour insertion drain ( please see also attach summary investigation ) . Measurements include arterial blood gas analysis drawn indwell arterial catheter , blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , mixed , expire CO2 ventilator setting . The measurement stop either end 48 hour period team care patient choose remove drain ( whichever first ) . All measurement include arterial blood gas analysis form part standard care ICU patient . The arterial blood gas measurement withdraw indwell arterial catheter routinely place ICU patient . Only use thoracic ultrasound train ultrasonographer procedure additional standard care patient . The use Chest X-rays discretion treat clinician form part study protocol . Standard biochemical , microbiological cytological test perform pleural fluid blood keep standard practice pleural effusion . The primary outcome measure effect drainage P : F ratio . measure dead space ventilation , A-a gradiants , ventilator setting dynamic compliance also assess</detailed_description>
