	<brief_title>Image-Guided Adaptive Conformal Photon Versus Proton Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 2 type radiation treatment use study . One type treatment proton therapy . Proton therapy type radiation therapy use beam proton particle ( similar get x-ray ) send radiation inside body tumor . The type treatment Image-Guided Adaptive Photon Therapy ( IGAPT ) . IGAPT therapy use image help guide delivery photon therapy tumor . Both type radiation treatment believe help doctor give full dose radiation treatment tumor damage much healthy tissue around . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , go standard radiation treatment planning procedure , call `` marking session . '' After mark session , standard photon therapy plan ( call Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy , IMRT ) proton plan develop . If radiation oncologist think photon proton plan acceptable , randomly assign 1 2 group . Participants Group 1 receive photon therapy . Participants Group 2 receive proton therapy . The first 20 participant equal chance assign either group . After least 20 participant enrol least 1 occurrence pneumonitis and/or tumor recurrence treatment Group , risk pneumonitis and/or tumor recurrence previous participant evaluate treatment Group , information use calculate chance assign either Group 1 Group 2 . This calculation update occurrence pneumonitis and/or tumor recurrence participant return follow-up visit . Once calculation begin , everyone join study point likely assign treatment Group appear good term pneumonitis and/or tumor recurrence . If tumor large standard radiation treatment plan create mark session find acceptable , radiation oncologist think radiation treatment necessary , still remain study assigned third group . If assign Group 3 , receive proton photon treatment low dose level and/or reduce length radiation . If assign Group 2 insurance provider deny reimbursement , may choose receive proton therapy receive photon therapy instead . If chose receive photon therapy , Group 4 . Radiation Therapy Administration : Both radiation therapy treatment ( photon proton ) give radiation machine call accelerator . The radiation therapy administration process similar way CT scan perform . You lay table treatment machine rotate around without touch body . Each daily treatment take 20-30 minute complete . Most time use position correctly machine turn . The actual time use give radiation take 3-5 minute day . While study Groups 1 2 , receive total 37 radiation treatment . Radiation give 5 day week 7 1/2 week . If Group 1 , receive photon radiation treatment main hospital . If Group 2 , receive proton therapy proton treatment center ( PTC ) . If Group 3 , receive either photon proton therapy , whichever doctor decide well , 6-7 1/2 week . If doctor decide photon therapy well receive treatment main hospital . If doctor decide proton therapy well receive treatment Proton Therapy Center . If Group 4 , receive Photon radiation treatment main hospital . Chemotherapy : You receive carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy 1 time week 7 week . Each treatment last 3-4 hour . Paclitaxel give vein 1 hour carboplatin give vein 30 minute . You receive chemotherapy combination radiation therapy , part treatment study . Your chemotherapy may also decide treat medical oncologist long therapy allow study . Study Visits During Chemoradiation : At least 1 time week study participant , study test perform . During weekly study visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor think need , PET/CT scan perform check status disease Week 4 5 treatment . Length Study : You remain study long benefiting . You take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think longer best interest receive study treatment . Follow-Up Visits : After complete chemoradiation , study staff study nurse contact 1 time month ask symptom may 6 month chemoradiation . Each phone call last 10 minute . You first follow-up visit 4-8 week complete chemoradiation . You additional follow-up visit every 3-4 month 3 year , every 6 month next 2 year , 1 time every year . At first second follow-up visit follow test procedure perform : - You positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan single proton emission tomography ( SPECT ) scan check status lung heart radiation medical oncologist think necessary . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . If radiation oncologist medical oncologist think need , follow-up visit , breathe function test perform check lung function 1 year study treatment complete . For test , radiation oncologist , medical oncologist study nurse breathe special machine . The radiation oncologist medical oncologist decide many test perform time . PET/CT SPECT scan performed time radiation oncologist medical oncologist think need . Other test may perform study doctor ( radiation oncologist , medical oncologist , surgeon pulmonologist ) think need . This investigational study . Both proton radiotherapy IGAPT FDA approve treatment lung cancer . Up 250 patient take part multicenter research study . Up 205 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
