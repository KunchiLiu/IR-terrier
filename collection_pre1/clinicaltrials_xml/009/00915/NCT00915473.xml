	<brief_title>Greater Occipital Nerve Block Migraine Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine common disease lifetime prevalence woman men 33 % 12 % respectively . Chronic migraine affect 2 % US population highly disable . There FDA approve medication treatment chronic migraine . Although patient benefit daily prophylactic medication , others continue suffer severe , frequent , debilitate headache . Limited efficacy , poor compliance , side effect drug-drug interaction may explain 80 % migraineurs population prescribe daily prophylactic medication . Occipital nerve injection corticosteroid and/or local anesthetic employ acute prophylactic treatment migraine , cervicogenic headache cluster headache decade . A long-acting anesthetic corticosteroid often combine , although anesthetic agent also use alone . However , randomize control trial evaluate preventive efficacy occipital nerve block subject migraine . Patients equally randomize receive either 2.5 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine plus 0.5 ml 20 mg methylprednisolone ipsilateral ( unilateral headache ) bilateral ( bilateral headache ) occipital nerve 2.75 ml normal saline plus 0.25 ml 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine ( placebo ) . The GON injection site medial third distance occipital protuberance mastoid process . Patients evaluate 4-week baseline diary completion phase undergo injection , 4 week injection . Therefore , 3 patient visit study : screening , injection 4-week follow-up . In effort ensure adequate blinding , 0.25 ml short-acting 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine use placebo arm . In order ensure adequate blinding investigator , syringe needle hub cover opaque tape ensure blind investigator provide injection . A total four investigator provide injection . The blinded investigator evaluate study subject 4 week injection may may investigator provided injection .</detailed_description>
