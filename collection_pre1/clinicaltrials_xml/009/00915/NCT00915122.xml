	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose cancer Canadian men third common cause cancer death.1 Locally advanced prostate cancer ( clinical T3/T4 ) uncommon North America early diagnosis follow widespread PSA test patient information campaign . However , past decade term high-risk prostate cancer develop include previous locally advanced disease patient T1/T2 disease poor prognostic feature ( either high Prostate Specific Antigen high Gleason score ) . The risk involvement pelvic lymph node prostate cancer certain subgroup intermediate risk high risk prostate cancer may substantial . The long term result conventional dose ( 66-70 Gy ) external beam radiation therapy intermediate locally advanced prostate cancer disappointing . The combination hormonal therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy dose escalation two strategy evaluate use improve result .</detailed_description>
