	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Potential Pulmonary Aspiration Markers From Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single center , prospective , observational study determine pepsin level BALF sample obtain consecutive bronchoscopies Mayo Clinic Jacksonville . It inherently exploratory pilot study confirm whether pepsin BAL act marker gastric pulmonary aspiration whether specific association pulmonary pathology identify . As overview , patient undergo bronchoscopy clinical indication screen potential participation study obtain BALF sample procedure laboratory analysis . The BALF test pepsin Thoracic Diseases Research Unit ( Mayo Clinic Rochester ) use commercially available ELISA kit , ancillary marker analyze per clinical laboratory . Internal control define normal subject lung dysfunction , respiratory symptom , lung parenchymal infiltrate chest radiograph . The primary aim project parallel short-term hypothesis state : 1 . Confirm pepsin detect quantitated BALF obtain routine bronchoscopy . 2 . Identify specific pulmonary pathology often associate increase pepsin BAL level . 3 . Identify normal range pepsin BALF control normal . 4 . Identify correlation pepsin BAL level reflux , swallow , respiratory symptom ( standardized questionnaire ) . 5 . Identify correlation pepsin BAL level lung function test radiographic abnormality . Secondary aim study include exploratory analysis lesser define potential aspiration marker include bilirubin , lipase , amylase , pepsinogen . Analyses marker parallel analysis perform pepsin . The focus study : - definitively identify whether pulmonary aspiration occur ; - quantitate burden aspiration occur ( i.e. , dose ) ; - localize aspiration occur ( e.g. , gastric , duodenal , biliary , oropharyngeal , nasal ) ; - identify specifically aspirate ( e.g. , acid , exogenous oil , bacteria , gastric content , bile , gastric enzyme , pancreatic enzyme ) .</detailed_description>
