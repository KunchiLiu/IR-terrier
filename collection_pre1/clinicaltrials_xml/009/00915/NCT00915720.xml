	<brief_title>Implanted Loop Recorder Post Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia cause significant morbidity mortality . Treatment AF consist medical therapy ablation therapy . Medical therapy help approximately 50 % patient , rest must resort ablation procedure . Ablation procedures aim isolate pulmonary vein atrial tissue electrically perform either endocardially catheter insert femoral vein epicardially minimal lateral thoracotomy . Both procedure accept standard care . Recurrent AF ablation therapy common occur 50 % patient could form short period AF persistent AF le minimal symptom . This significant clinical relevance AF episodes recognize lead thromboembolic event stroke . However , technique surveillance AF post ablation suboptimal . Physicians could use holter monitoring limited short period 24 - 48 hour . Event recorder external use patient need experience symptom associate AF episodes order record episodes . Better AF monitor technique especially AF ablation necessary recognition AF recurrence patient could possible timely anticoagulation therapy initiate may prevent stroke . This pilot study involve implant loop recorder skin record cardiac rhythm 24 hour per day without interaction patient . These device currently approve FDA monitor syncope implant patient AF ablation surgery .</detailed_description>
