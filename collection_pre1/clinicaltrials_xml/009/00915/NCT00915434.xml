	<detailed_description>This open-label ( physician healthy volunteer know treatment administer ) , randomize ( treatment order determine chance ) , single-dose study characterize pharmacokinetics ( process JNJ-31001074 absorbed , distribute , metabolize , eliminate body ) effect food pharmacokinetics JNJ-31001074 . The study consist three phase : screening phase determine eligibility , open-label treatment phase end-of-study/early withdrawal assessment phase . During screen phase , healthy volunteer evaluate see meet selection criterion specify protocol . Healthy volunteer meet criterion report study center Day -1 begin treatment . The open-label treatment phase consist 4 period . In period , volunteer receive one follow treatment : Treatment A 1 mg JNJ-31001074 , Treatment B 3 mg JNJ-31001074 , Treatment C 10 mg JNJ-31001074 , Treatment D 10 mg JNJ-31001074 . Treatment A , B C administer fasting condition ( food beverage 10 hour prior dose ) Treatment D administer high-fat meal . The order volunteer receive treatment determine random fashion ( like flip coin ) . Each treatment separate 7-14 day washout period . Multiple blood urine sample collect 72 hour dose . Safety tolerability assess throughout volunteer 's participation . Volunteers instruct report adverse event occur 30 day last dose study drug . The maximum study duration volunteer expect 66 day . JNJ-31001074 1 , 3 10 mg administer orally Day 1 4 treatment period ( dose depend participant 's treatment sequence )</detailed_description>
