	<brief_summary>The purpose feasibility study determine effect stimulate phrenic nerve treat periodic breathing ( pattern breathe characterize hyperpnea follow hypopneas apnea ) . Clinically , physiologic event translate sleep fragmentation , excessive daytime sleepiness , reduce exercise capacity , possibly ventricular arrhythmia . Stage 1 study acute nature , subject undergo placement stimulation lead , follow assessment stimulation phrenic nerve use lead 2 night sleep . A sensing lead may also place initial implant procedure . Observational data obtain stimulation provide use externalized system connect study lead . Following study , investigational component remove patient . Stage 2 study conduct one participating sit determine initial safety chronic stimulation phrenic nerve limit number patient sleep disordered breathing . It anticipate data obtain feasibility study show propose intervention modify respiration low incidence adverse effect . The result trial intend use develop subsequent protocol multi-center study chronic phrenic nerve pacing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient 18 year age old Patient demonstrate history periodic breathing ( symptom may include sleep fragmentation , report patient witness another person , night arousal apneic episode , reduce exercise capacity , daytime sleepiness ) Patient expect able tolerate procedure remain clinically stable duration study ( e.g . subject able lie long enough insert lead ( ) without shortness breath subject able tolerate instrumentation study ) . Patient legal representative willing able sign IRB/MEC approve informed consent ( privacy protection authorization United States ) Baseline oxygen saturation less equal 90 % stable FIO2 Evidence phrenic nerve palsy Temperature &gt; 38.0 degree Celsius Inability place catheter ( e.g . previously know coagulopathy , distorted anatomy , etc . ) Patient currently enrol another study may confound result study Patient informed consent obtain Patient pregnant child bear potential without negative pregnancy test within 10 day study procedure Patients implanted pacemaker , implantable defibrillator , cardiac resynchronization device unable tolerate turn device duration system test procedure ( base medical judgment ) Patients severe COPD ( per GOLD scale ) Patients history myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study Patients unstable angina Patients intolerant allergic contrast dye Patients contraindicate &lt; 1mg steroid ( stimulation lead ) .</criteria>
