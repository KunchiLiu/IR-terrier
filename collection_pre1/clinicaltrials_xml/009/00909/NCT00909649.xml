	<detailed_description>This study carry January 2005 December 2007 Mansoura university hospital , Departement 8 surgical department . This study approve local ethical committee Fifty patient breast cancer include study . Patients receive preoperative chemotherapy radiotherapy exclude Also , patient previous axillary surgery patient undergo simultaneous reconstructive surgery breast conservative surgery locally advance breast cancer exclude . Informed write consent obtain patient include study . All patient include study , MRM do axillary lymphadenectomy extend axillary level III do sharp dissection ligation visible lymph vessel minor blood vessel . After perform hemostasis mastectomy axillary area . .Patients randomly divide closed envelop two group . Patients randomized end surgical procedure avoid possible treatment bias surgical procedure . Group І ( fibrin glue ) group П without fibrin glue . In fibrin glue group . 4 ml fibrin glue spray surgical area Y canula ( doubleject application system ) . In group 11 good haemostasis size drain applied axillary breast area incision close . Followed external compression 10 minute group . Drains left place drainage precede 24 h less 30 ml/day . Data collect Preoperative data collect included age , body mass indexed ( BMI ) , medical surgical history , history chemotherapy , radiotherapy Operative data include estimate blood loss , type dissection , duration operation Postoperative data include hospital stay , postoperative measurement drainage daily , date removal , state wound ( infection , haematoma , necrosis , open wound ) , number axillary lymph node dissect , cancer stage , number axillary lymph node positive , incidence Seroma formation , interval Seroma resolution , Seroma aspirate volume number postoperative visit Seroma formation define inability remove participant drain postoperative day 10 high output ( 30 ml /day drain Seroma ) / need aspirate fluid removal drain .</detailed_description>
