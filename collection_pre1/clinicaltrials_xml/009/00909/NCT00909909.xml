	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy different way may kill tumor cell . Giving surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect radiation therapy see well work treat woman early stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine freedom local regional failure woman early stage breast cancer treat accelerate , hypofractionated radiotherapy . - To determine acute late toxicity accelerate , hypofractionated radiotherapy use previously publish toxicity scale . Secondary - To measure cosmesis use Harvard cosmesis scale patient undergone lumpectomy . - To identify co-variates responsible poor cosmetic outcome patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergone lumpectomy undergo either intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost hypofractionated , accelerate whole breast irradiation ( AWBI ) OR 3D-conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) /intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) boost AWBI . Patients undergone mastectomy undergo hypofractionated , accelerate chest wall irradiation . - Intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost AWBI ( post-lumpectomy ) : Patients undergo intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost twice daily 2 day ( total 4 fraction ) . Beginning 5-21 day completion brachytherapy , patient undergo AWBI daily 5 day week approximately 2 week ( total 11 fraction ) . - 3D-CRT/IMRT boost AWBI ( post-lumpectomy ) : Patients undergo 3D-CRT/IMRT boost twice daily 2 day ( total 4 fraction ) . Patients also undergo AWBI boost radiotherapy . - Accelerated chest wall irradiation ( post-mastectomy ) : Patients undergo accelerate chest wall irradiation daily 5 day week approximately 2 week ( total 11 fraction ) . Patients undergone lumpectomy undergo frontal digital photography breast baseline , immediately initiation radiotherapy , annually 3 year completion radiotherapy . These patient also complete Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale baseline 3 year completion radiotherapy . Physicians complete Harvard Cosmesis scale baseline 1 3 year completion radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 1 , 4 , 8 every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
