	<brief_title>Thrombocytopenia Bleeding Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome X-linked disease characterize immunodeficiency , eczema thrombocytopenia ; milder form disease know X-Linked thrombocytopenia also exist . The thrombocytopenia WAS XLT characterize : severe thrombocytopenia platelet count frequently less 10-30,000/ul ; small platelet may dysfunctional ; , result , high rate serious bleed include intracranial hemorrhage . Because eltrombopag show remarkably efficacious substantially increase platelet count high percentage ITP patient , study seek effectively treat patient exhibit similar pathology , well evaluate state platelet patient WAS relate clinical bleeding . It also aim demonstrate whether eltrombopag administer daily enhance stem cell function , increase platelet production platelet count , reduce bleed patient WAS .</detailed_description>
