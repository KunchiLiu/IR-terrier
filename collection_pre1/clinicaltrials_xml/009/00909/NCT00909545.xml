	<detailed_description>There solid scientific rational preclinical data support clinical trial isradipine CR potential disease modify agent early PD . Human pharmacokinetic data demonstrate feasible achieve serum concentration human neuroprotective preclinical model FDA approve dosage range . Pilot data demonstrate acceptable tolerability isradipine CR PD population . Tolerability inversely proportional dosage dependent . Considering tolerability isradipine CR inversely proportional dosage exposure , essential proceed dose selection tolerability study preparation future efficacy trial . The tolerability , define ability complete study , three dosage isradipine CR relative placebo subject early Parkinson 's disease examine first . The dosage tolerable demonstrate preliminary efficacy evaluate future pivotal efficacy study .</detailed_description>
