	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety ivacaftor subject cystic fibrosis age 12 year old G551D mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . Ivacaftor potent selective CFTR potentiator wild-type , G551D , F508del , R117H form human CFTR protein . Potentiators pharmacological agent increase chloride ion transport property channel presence cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ivacaftor Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years Older With G551D Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 3 study subject cystic fibrosis ( CF ) age 12 year old G551D-CFTR mutation percent predict forced expiratory volumn 1 second ( FEV1 ) 40 % 90 % . Based vitro study pharmacologic , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , safety profile , ivacaftor select clinical development possible treatment patient CF . Patients G551D mutation target population study ivacaftor potentiator gate function CFTR protein , prevalent mutation gate defect CF G551D mutation . This study design evaluate efficacy ivacaftor subject CF G551D-CFTR gene mutation evaluate safety population longer period previously study .</detailed_description>
