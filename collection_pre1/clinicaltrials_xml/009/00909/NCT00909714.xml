	<brief_title>Neuroregeneration Enhanced Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( TDCS ) Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause long-term disability , significantly impairs economic social life patient society . Every year 200 000 250 000 patient suffer stroke Germany . Only small number stroke survivor recover degree allows return professional private life . Despite significant effort develop novel efficient treatment strategy level functional regeneration still satisfy . Thus , development innovative effective treatment strategy major impact patient ' life , society public health system . Within propose project innovative , non-invasive cost effective interventional strategy , base combination specific rehabilitative training brain stimulation transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , use enhance functional regeneration stroke patient . The intervention apply early stage plasticity , cortical reorganization functional improvement pronounce . We hypothesize combination anodal tDCS deliver motor cortex affect hemisphere combine train period two week subacute stage stroke significantly enhance cortical plasticity , functional regeneration long-term outcome determine clinical functional outcome measure compare Placebo stimulation .</detailed_description>
