	<brief_summary>Exercise-induced increase pulmonary arterial pressure may early sign pulmonary arterial hypertension . It show patient normal pulmonary arterial pressure rest elevate pulmonary arterial pressure exercise decrease exercise-capacity may worse prognosis compare patient normal pulmonary arterial pressure value rest exercise . According currently use definition pulmonary hypertension diagnose mean pulmonary arterial pressure high 25mmHg rest 30mmHg exercise . In study patient risk pulmonary arterial hypertension ( connective tissue disease ) increase pulmonary arterial pressure value exercise receive therapy dual endothelin receptor antagonist - bosentan , therapy establish pulmonary arterial hypertension . The therapy effect compare record change introduction therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bosentan establish therapy pulmonary arterial hypertension , may diagnose mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 25mmHg rest &gt; 30mmHg exercise . Bosentan show efficacy , mean pulmonary arterial pressure elevate rest . However , data available effect therapy , mean pulmonary arterial pressure normal rest elevate exercise . The purpose study provide additional data group patient . Our hypothesis patient exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension may show gradual worsen pulmonary hemodynamics potentially development manifest pulmonary arterial hypertension ( elevate rest pulmonary arterial pressure value ) without treatment , introduction Bosentan may improve hemodynamics exercise capacity patient group .</detailed_description>
