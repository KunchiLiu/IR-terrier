	<brief_summary>Low birth weight ( LBW ; birth weight &lt; 2,500g ) important determinant mortality morbidity neonatal period . It also important factor predict nutritional status , health development childhood . It even influence health adult life , contribute vicious cycle disease poverty . The high rate LBW DCs represent therefore major public health problem . Maternal chronic energy deficiency assume major determinant problem country along prenatal micronutrient deficiency . A large body recent evidence point multiple micronutrient supplementation modest beneficial effect fetal growth . Therefore , expect provide multiple micronutrient food supplement cover energy requirement need pregnant woman effect public health importance child 's health . This study objective improve child 's health improve birth outcome fetal growth provision food supplement enrich multimicronutrients pregnancy . This research include 2 constituent : 1. pilot phase dietary behavior pregnant woman assess component optimal fetal growth 2. randomize , placebo-controlled trial , include 1300 pregnant woman aim test 2 hypothesis : supplement pregnant woman food supplement contain multivitamin-minerals mix improve fetal growth ; improve fetal growth positive effect health growth infancy . The trial plan Hounde District , Burkina Faso , collaboration Centre Muraz , play leader role research service provide district level policy recommendation national level .

	<brief_title>Effect Prenatal Nutritional Supplementation Birth Outcome Hounde District , Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low birth weight ( LBW ; birth weight &lt; 2500g ) important predictor mortality morbidity neonatal period early postnatal growth growth childhood . It also associate cognitive behavioral development first year life , health status childhood , adult health human capital . As much 16 % live birth worldwide present LBW , 90 % low-income country . Rates particularly high Asia sub-Saharan country . In Burkina Faso , estimate 19 % live birth 1999-2005 LBW . In develop country , case LBW attribute intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) rather preterm delivery . Factors interact fetal development numerous . Among maternal malnutrition , particularly energy micronutrient deficiency , malaria pregnancy assume major determinant IUGR . Dietary survey consistently show multiple micronutrient deficiency , rather single deficiency , common . However , number randomize clinical trial various country show modest beneficial effect fetal growth provide multiple micronutrient supplement pregnancy compare folic acid iron supplementation . It expect chronic energy deficiency pregnancy could hamper full potential effect multiple micronutrient supplementation . Therefore expect incorporate multiple micronutrient food supplement ( FS ) , provide supplementary energy protein , instead multiple micronutrient ( UNIMMAP ) , could effect public health importance fetal growth correlate . The UNIMMAP supplement composition , incorporate FS give form tablet , propose expert committee organize UNICEF , WHO UNU pregnancy lactate woman . The study take place health district Houndé ( south-west Burkina Faso ) surround 2 health center ( 12,000 inhabitant ) June 2003 October 2006 . Houndé situate Sudano-Sahelian climate belt . The diet essentially cereal-based . In 2004 2006 , food consumption survey estimate average caloric intake pregnancy 8.6 MJ 8.1 MJ postharvest pre-harvest season respectively . Malaria transmission permanent seasonal variation . In 2002 , HIV prevalence among consult pregnant woman district estimate 2 % . The incidence LBW term infant around 17 % District Hospital 2000-2001 . The recruitment participant community-based . During preliminary census , house study area map numbered unique identification code allocate every woman child-bearing age . Thirty locally train home-visitors visit monthly every compound early detection pregnancy referral health center pregnancy test . Once pregnancy confirm extensive explanation study purpose procedure Bwamu , Moré Dioula , participant ask provide sign consent thumbprint . There exclusion criterion plan leave area within next 2 year . This study randomize control trial , directly observe supplement intake . Pregnant woman randomly assign receive daily either UNIMMAP tablet ( vitamin A 800µg , vitamin E 10 mg , vitamin D 5 µg , vitamin B1 1.4 mg , vitamin B2 1.4 mg , niacin 18 mg , vitamin B6 1.9 mg , vitamin B12 2.6 µg , folic acid 400 µg , vitamin C 70 mg , iron 30 mg , zinc 15 mg , copper 2 mg , selenium 65 µg , iodine 150 µg ) delivery , either food supplement contain UNIMMAP . The food supplement consist 33 % peanut butter , 32 % heat-treated soy flour , 15 % vegetable oil , 20 % plain sugar UNIMMAP micronutrient cocktail powder form . Each participant allocate FS study group receive 72g FS daily provide 1.56 MJ ( 372 kcal ) energy 14.7g protein . The supplement produce local woman 's association collaboration food technologist , micronutrient FS dose laboratory technician . UNIMMAP micronutrient tablet manufacture Scanpharm ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) . A randomization scheme generate computer program permute block 4 . Randomization number seal opaque envelope administrative staff . At inclusion , consult physician field open next seal envelope transmit randomization number case MMN pharmacist manage packaging drug individual plastic zip sachet contain 31 tablet . In case randomization number show allocation FS group , responsible FS production site together project staff , prepare plastic bag contain 31 FS sachet . Participants also randomly assign randomize receive intermittent malaria prophylaxis either two dos two dos combine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( single dose represent 1500 mg sulfadoxine 75mg pyrimethamine ) . The malaria component analyse separately . In case maternal illness , appropriate treatment provide accord national guideline . Severely anemic woman ( hemoglobin &lt; 70 g/L , without dyspnea ) receive ferrous sulphate ( 200 mg ) + folic acid ( 0.25 mg ) twice daily , 3 month whatever allocation group . All participant also receive Albendazole 400 mg second third trimester . In case malaria episode despite preventative treatment , quinine ( 300 mg , 3 time day ) give 5 day . Vitamin A ( 200.000 IU ) give woman delivery , conformity national recommendation .</detailed_description>
