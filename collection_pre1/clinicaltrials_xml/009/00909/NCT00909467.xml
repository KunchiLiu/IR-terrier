	<brief_title>Early Recognition Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Myelodysplastic Myeloproliferative Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For early recognition pulmonary hypertension exercise doppler echocardiography use patient . Patients elevate pulmonary arterial pressure rest exercise ( estimate echocardiography ) , decrease exercise capacity ( potential sign pulmonary hypertension ) advise undergo right heart catheterisation . Cardiopulmonary exercise test six-minute walk distance measurement perform measure exercise capacity . The described work-up patient allow precise objective hemodynamic clinical evaluation .</detailed_description>
