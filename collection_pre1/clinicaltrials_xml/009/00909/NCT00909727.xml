	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety ivacaftor subject cystic fibrosis age 6 11 year G551D mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . Ivacaftor potent selective potentiator wild-type , G551D , F508del , R117H form human CFTR protein . Potentiators pharmacological agent increase chloride ion transport property channel presence cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) -dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ivacaftor Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 6 11 Years With G551D Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , 2-part , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group multicenter study orally administer ivacaftor subject cystic fibrosis ( CF ) 6 11 year age G551D-CFTR mutation force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) 90 % 105 % predict ( use Knudson standard ) . Based vitro study pharmacologic , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , safety profile , ivacaftor select clinical development possible treatment patient CF . Patients G551D mutation target population study ivacaftor potentiator gate effect CFTR protein , prevalent mutation gate defect CF G551D mutation . This study conduct 2 part . Part A conducted analyze PK property ivacaftor determine appropriate dose administer subject Part B study . Part B explore safety efficacy ivacaftor long-term treatment subject 6 11 year age .</detailed_description>
