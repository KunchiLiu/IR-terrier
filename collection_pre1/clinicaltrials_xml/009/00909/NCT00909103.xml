	<detailed_description>Ultrasound elastography recent ultrasound method use calculation tissue elasticity distribution real-time . The method allow reconstruction tissue elasticity ( i.e . elasticity modulus ) reveal directly physical property tissue , consequently show different tissue hardness pattern determine disease . Tissue elastography easily perform real-time conventional probe , include linear EUS probe use examination pancreas . The calculation tissue elasticity distribution perform real-time examination result represent transparent overlay colour image overimposed conventional gray-scale B-mode image . Ultrasound elastography previously use diagnosis breast lesion , prostate cancer thyroid nodule . However , value endoscopic ultrasound elastography diagnosis pancreatic focal mass clear current moment , author could n't differentiate benign malignant pancreatic tumor . Moreover , intense fibrotic reaction calcification chronic pancreatitis induce strain difference , clear elastography sensitive enough detect . The study protocol base semi-quantitative approach EUS elastography data ( movie ) consist characterization manually user-defined region interest , base hue histogram individual focal mass . Due inherent bias induce selection image dynamic sequence EUS elastography , previously report utility use computer-aided diagnosis average image dynamic sequence EUS elastography . A special plugin ( base ImageJ software , NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) use compute hue histograms average EUS elastography image , hue histogram value patient ( 0 255 value ) use classify patient benign malignant lesion . Ultrasound elastography perform usual EUS examination ( 7.5 MHz frequency ) , two movie 10 second record embed HDD order minimize variability increase repeatability acquisition . A two panel image usual conventional gray-scale B-mode EUS image right side elastography image leave side use . The region interest preferably large focal mass , order include surround structure . In order minimize human bias , post-processing computer analysis digital movie perform within IT Center Craiova , programmer statistician blind clinical , pathological imaging data , exception average hue histogram value calculate second region interest manually trace around focal mass . The study design prospective , blind multi-center , compare endoscopic ultrasound elastography ( EUS-EG ) result detection characterization focal pancreatic mass use artificial intelligence technique , comparison gold standard represent pathology . The study perform approval institutional board review center .</detailed_description>
