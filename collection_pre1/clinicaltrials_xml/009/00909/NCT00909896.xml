	<brief_title>Study Post Operative Pain Endometrial Cancer Robotic Versus Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective measure compare postoperative pain rest several time point ( 24 +/-4hours , 48 +/-4hours , 72 +/-4hours ) two group patient undergo either robotic open laparotomy approach stag endometrial cancer . Post operative Quality Life also collect several time point . The total amount post operative opioid requirement first 24hours patient undergo either robotic open laparotomy approach surgery . The survival status every four month first two year monitor , every 6 month 5 year . The primary endpoint mean difference post operative pain VAS score report subject rest follow time point : 24+/-4 , 48+/-4 , 72+/-4 hour group surgery complete .</detailed_description>
