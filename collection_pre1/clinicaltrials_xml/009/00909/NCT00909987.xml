	<brief_summary>Phase II , Multicenter , Open-label , Non-randomized Study Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy ( CAPECITABINE-OXALIPLATIN + BEVACIZUMAB ) Selective Radiotherapy Chemotherapy CAPECITABINE Use Patients Intermediate-Risk Cancer Rectum Defined Magnetic Resonance Imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Neoadjuvant CT With Selective Radiotherapy Patients With Intermediate-Risk Cancer Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>XELOX / Bevacizumab administrate 3 cycle 9 week period . XELOX without Bevacizumab administrate additional cycle 4 week period . Patients undergo re-staging within 3 week 4th cycle XELOX . This include MRI pelvis . If reassessment reveals disease progression compare pre-treatment evaluation patient remain candidate R0 resection , patient proceed definitive rectal cancer surgery within 4 week last chemotherapy dose . If surgical oncologist 's reassessment reveals patient candidate R0 resection , patient proceed standard pre-operative radiation synchronous Capecitabine .</detailed_description>
