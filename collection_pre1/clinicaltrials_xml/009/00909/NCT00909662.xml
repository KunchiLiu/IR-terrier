	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess treatment-related fatigue , cognitive dysfunction , recovery woman undergo adjuvant chemotherapy stage I-III breast cancer compare patient-selected control population . - To determine whether fatigue induce sustain isometric contraction ( SIC ) central peripheral ( muscular ) origin patient without treatment-related fatigue . - To characterize change baseline potential abnormal signal processing brain perform cognitive-assessment testing ( CAT ) patient experience chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction compare control . OUTLINE : Patients participant undergo assessment treatment-related fatigue cognitive dysfunction ( i.e. , mental fatigue ) baseline , completion 3-4 course standard adjuvant chemotherapy , 1-3 week completion recent treatment . Patient recovery assess approximately 1 year baseline . Study assessment include brief fatigue inventory , cognitive assessment , muscle fatigability test sustain isometric contraction . Additional assessment include quantification brain muscle signal alteration patient without treatment-related fatigue cognitive-assessment testing patient experience chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction . Patients participant also undergo collection data obtain information patient age , body mass index , menopausal status baseline 1 year . Additional information collect type chemotherapy treatment hormonal anticancer treatment administer throughout course study . Cancer recurrences new cancer event also record .</detailed_description>
