After completion screen assessment confirmation eligibility , subject return site Day -9 undergo practice endurance test session . In addition , Day -9 subject give pedometer ask wear awake 7 consecutive day Day -8 7 consecutive day Day 20 estimate daily physical mobility level home environment . Subjects return site Days -1 27 safety assessment , MRI/MRS assessment exercise endurance test . On Days 1 28 subject admit overnight inpatient . PK sample collect 24 hour post-dose Days 2 29 . During dose period safety visit perform approximately Days 7 , 14 , 21 . Additional telephone safety assessment make approximately Days 3 , 5 , 10 , 17 , 20 24 . The End Dosing Follow-up visit perform approximately 35 day follow first dose SRT2104 placebo . An additional follow safety telephone call make subject 30 day follow final dose SRT2104 and/or placebo . The end study define last subject 's last assessment ( i.e . Day 58 , date last subject communication ) . Subjects instruct self administer test material home study day 3-27 . All study visit outpatient visit except Day 1 Day 28 .
