	<brief_summary>Background : Repeated episode bleed gastrointestinal vascular malformation refractory endoscopic surgical therapy often pose major therapeutic challenge . Methods : The investigator perform randomize , parallel control study thalidomide therapy recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due vascular malformation . Patients least six episode bleed prior year due vascular malformation randomly group , prescribe four-month regimen either 25 mg thalidomide 100 mg iron orally four time daily , monitor least one year . The primary end point define patient whose rebleeds decrease baseline ≥ 50 % 12 month cessation bleeding . Rebleeding define base positive fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) ( monoclonal colloidal gold color technology ) visit treatment . Secondary outcome include participant dependent blood transfusion change baseline transfuse packed red cell unit , bleed episode , bleed duration , hemoglobin level 12 month . Statistical significance define P &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol Description : This exploratory , randomize , parallel control study thalidomide recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding vascular malformation . Informed consent take subject Institute Ethics Committee approve study protocol . All procedure accordance Declaration Helsinki . The study support pharmaceutical funding . Study design Intervention : From Nov. 2004 Nov. 2007 , patient repeat episodes chronic gastro-intestinal bleeding due vascular malformation identify oesophagogastroduodenoscopy , capsule endoscope double-balloon endoscope enrol ( accord enrollment criterion ) . The patient randomly assign receive four-month course either 25 mg thalidomide 100mg iron orally daily time 6 a.m.,12 noon,6 p.m. 10 p.m. , respectively . Randomization perform proc plan procedure Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS ) , use method randomly permute block 4 . Within block , number patient allocate two treatment equal . Each patient meet inclusion criterion consecutively assign random number chronological order , allocate one treatment group . A blinded research nurse supervise patient randomization drug administration . In case adverse event , study medication temporarily permanently discontinue base subject inclination toxicity intolerance . Concomitant therapy , blood transfusion symptomatic treatment like iron supplementation , perform group necessary four-month treatment subsequent follow-up period . Blood transfusion indicate record hemoglobin ( Hb ) level reach &lt; 7.0 g/dl . Red-cell transfusion administer accord patient Hb level follow : 2 unit administer 6.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dl , 3 unit 5.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 6.0 g/dl , 4 unit Hb &lt; 5.0 g/dl . Iron provide patient 7.0 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 11.0 g/dl . After four-month treatment course , patient discontinue study medication except case symptomatic treatment necessary describe . Assessment response adverse event : The primary end point define patient whose rebleeds decrease baseline ≥ 50 % 12 month cessation bleeding . Rebleeding define base positive fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) ( monoclonal colloidal gold color technology ) visit treatment . Secondary outcome include participant dependent blood transfusion change baseline transfuse packed red cell unit , bleed episode , bleed duration , hemoglobin level 12 month . Adverse event include unfavorable change health , include abnormal laboratory finding , study follow-up period . Evaluation Patients Follow-up : - Certified research nurse collect information demographic medical social history patient enrol study . - After screen baseline evaluation , patient closely monitored hospital least one week . They follow twice monthly four-mouth course treatment month thereafter . - Clinical follow-up perform qualified doctor . At visit , bleeding-related parameter ( number duration ) , physical examination perform laboratory value obtain FOBT , complete blood count , serum chemistry , hepatic renal function . Neuropathy adverse event also assess . - Patients advise refrain non-prescribed medicine , especially rebleeding-related medication aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , anti-platelet drug , anticoagulant , Chinese medication ( salicylate ) , gingko , Echinacea . Measurement Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Sera : Laboratory assay VEGF perform baseline four-month treatment course thalidomide group , technician blind assignment final assessment . Three milliliter serum peripheral venous blood sample centrifuge ( 3000 r/min 4°C , 10 min ) , extract , separate freeze tube , store -70°C 4 month . Plasma VEGF level ( pg/ml ) determine duplicate use sandwich ELISA kit ( R &amp; D Systems , USA ) laboratory Shanghai Research Institute Digestive Disease . Samples patient batch-tested single run . For quality control , sample retested two time subsequent run confirm result first run . Statistical Analysis : To knowledge , similar study previously perform , thus unable refer publish study determine sample . To end , perform unpublished preliminary study . Response iron-control group thalidomide group reach 10 % 80 % , due loose inclusion criterion ( bleed history restrict ) . For study , estimate primary outcome ( proportion subject whose number yearly bleeds decrease ≥ 50 % ) would occur 10 % control group 80 % thalidomide group patient . An equally divided sample 11 subject deem sufficient detect primary end point , type I error ( two-sided ) 5 % power 90 % . Assuming 10 % volunteer attrition rate follow-up , establish target sample size 13 per group ( calculate nquery advisor software 5.0 ) . Analyses response adverse event perform registered patient accord intention-to-treat principle . Statistical analysis perform blinded biostatistician Statistical Product Service Solutions ( SPSS ) 13.0 software package . We simultaneously analyze primary endpoint full analysis set ( FAS ) per protocol set ( PPS ) . Continuous variable compare use two-sample independent t-test Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Categorical variable compare use chi-squared Fisher 's exact test . A paired t-test employ compare difference plasma VEGF level thalidomide treatment . The Breslow-Day test use test heterogeneity treatment effect across stratum . All report P-values two-sided . Data report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) median ( range ) continuous variable number ( % ) categorical variable . Since adjustment control group minimal , also report point estimate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . For outcome , P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
