	<detailed_description>The overall goal project develop assess effectiveness cost-effectiveness strategy use genetic testing management anticoagulation among racially diverse hospitalized patient . The project four specific aim . Aim 1 : To contribute patient initiate therapy University Chicago Medical Center ( UCMC ) affiliate hospital genetic registry racially diverse set patient undergoing warfarin therapy . Aim 2 : To perform randomized trial determine efficacy , cost cost-effectiveness exist pharmacogenetic algorithms management warfarin therapy among hospitalized patient race . Aim 3 : To develop clinical pharmacogenetic algorithm management warfarin therapy among hospitalized African American patient . Aim 4 : To perform randomized trial determine compare efficacy , cost cost-effectiveness exist clinical non-racially tailor pharmacogenetic algorithm racially tailor pharmacogenetic algorithms management warfarin therapy among hospitalized African American patient .</detailed_description>
