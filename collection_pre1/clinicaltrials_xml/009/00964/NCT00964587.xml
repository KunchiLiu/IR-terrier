	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease Education Problem-Solving Training People With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>African Americans type 2 diabetes suffer excess disease burden , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor hyperglycemia , hypertension , dyslipidemia modifiable medical management lifestyle modification . Patient diabetes education counsel behavior change recommend standard practice facilitate effective self-management risk factor . However , patient low literacy health literacy , accessibility impact educational behavioral intervention limit . Pilot research suggest : ) literacy demand behavioral activation characteristic patient education module adapt facilitate learning urban patient low literacy , b ) combine literacy-adapted education problem-solving training facilitates understand use health information perform self-management context daily life ( functional health literacy ) . Optimal modality delivery combine patient diabetes education problem-solving training , cost-effectiveness intervention model , however , know . The propose study address need test effectiveness cost-effectiveness literacy-adapted diabetes CVD education problem-solving training intervention urban African Americans type 2 diabetes high CVD risk profile ( suboptimal blood sugar , blood pressure , and/or lipid ) . The specific aim study : ) complete development package literacy-adapted diabetes CVD patient education material develop two video/DVDs address self-management recommendation appropriate need , resource , environment population ; b ) randomize urban African-American adult type 2 diabetes high CVD risk profile one four study arm : Usual Care ( Arm 1 ) , Literacy-Adapted Education Problem-Solving Training Self-Study ( Arm 2 ) , Literacy-Adapted Education Group Problem-Solving Training ( Arm 3 ) , Literacy-Adapted Education Individual Problem-Solving Training ( Arm 4 ) ; c ) conduct baseline , 3-month post-intervention , 6-month post-intervention assessment visit analyze compare effectiveness literacy-adapted education problem-solving intervention , compare Usual Care , improve skill knowledge , problem-solving health literacy , behavior patient activation diabetes self-management , clinical outcome A1C , blood pressure lipid ; ) perform cost-effectiveness analysis intervention arm compare Usual Care . If proven effective , research yield low literacy diabetes CVD patient education self-management intervention tool dissemination high-risk urban minority population . Moreover , cost-effectiveness analysis provide evidence support decision-making regard implementation model achieve cardiovascular disease patient self-management goal clinical practice .</detailed_description>
