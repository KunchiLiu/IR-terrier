	<brief_summary>The purpose study see body reacts different strength H1N1 flu shot give without `` adjuvant . '' An adjuvant substance may cause body produce antibody give vaccine . This study also compare age affect body 's response H1N1 flu shot . In study , 3 strength H1N1 flu shot test combined adjuvant . In addition , 2 strength H1N1 flu shot test without adjuvant . Two H1N1 flu shot strength , without adjuvant , give 3 week apart . Participants include 800 healthy adult , approximately 500 individual age 18-64 250 individual great equal age 65 . Study procedure include : physical exam , blood sample , complete memory aid record vaccine side effect , medication daily oral temperature . Participants involve study related procedure 13 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CSL H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Administered Different Dose Levels With Without AS03 Adjuvant Healthy Adult Elderly Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . Based clinical data clinical trial vaccine contain novel influenza A antigen , high dosage , multiple dos novel antigen may necessary generate potentially protective antibody response . Alternatively , inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine administer adjuvant , AS03 , may confer protection maximal number vaccine recipient . This protocol explore antibody response follow vaccination inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine 3 different dose level combine AS03 adjuvant 2 different dose level administer without adjuvant . This study assess immune response follow single dose vaccine without AS03 adjuvant , ass whether individual pre-existing 'prime ' immunity , initial H1N1 vaccination serve boost , thus confer rapid time protection need few dos . Antibody response assess 8 day dose evaluate development anamnestic response . In addition , antibody response assess 21 day dose . The primary objective : safety , assess safety inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 , 7.5 15 mcg combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 15 mcg administer without adjuvant ; immunogenicity , ass antibody response Day 21 follow single dose inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 , 7.5 15 mcg combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 15 mcg administer without adjuvant , stratify age recipient . The secondary objective immunogenicity , ass antibody response follow 2 dos inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 , 7.5 15 mcg combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 15 mcg administer without adjuvant , stratify age recipient . Participants include 800 healthy adult history novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase II study . Subjects randomize 5 group , stratify age ( 150 subject per dose group 100 subject 18-64 year age stratum 50 subject great equal 65 year age stratum ) , receive intramuscular inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 3.75 , 7.5 15 mcg combine AS03 adjuvant ( Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively ) 7.5 15 mcg without adjuvant ( Groups 4 5 , respectively ) . The vaccine , without adjuvant , administered Days 0 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event ( AEs ) 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive dos Day 21 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition 12 month post final vaccination ( Day 365 second vaccination ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody test serum obtain prior vaccination , 8-10 day vaccination , 21 day ( Day 42 ) , 6 month ( Day 201 ) 12 month ( Day 386 ) follow second vaccination .</detailed_description>
