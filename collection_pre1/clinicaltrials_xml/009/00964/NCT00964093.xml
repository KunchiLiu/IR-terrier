	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Silver Alginate ( Algidex ) Patch Prevention Central Line Infections Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With rapid technological advancement , increase use vascular catheter improve patient care strategy , also contribute risk infection . Unfortunately , catheter relate blood stream infection still remain one major cause morbidity VLBW infant . In United States , approximately 850,000 infection attribute catheter annually , occur primarily intensive care unit patient . The National Institute Child Health Human Development state 20 % infant less 1500 gram least one positive blood culture delay stay neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . One approach reduce incidence infection could utilize antimicrobial property silver . Silver alginate proven safe beneficial adult population prevent catheter relate infection . Studies do mouse rat suggest acute toxicity occur animal give 23 mg silver acetate/kg body weight chronic toxicity notice animal give 1.5 mg/kg/day ( 5 ) Chronic toxicity human show ingestion 13 mg/kg/day ( 3 ) In recently conclude pilot randomize control trial do VLBW infant , safety silver alginate demonstrate lack skin reaction patch mild increase serum silver level ( Khattak et al ; Pediatrics research March 2008 , clinicaltrials.gov id : NCT00593684 ) . However , clinical evidence efficacy VLBW neonatal population . Based data pilot safety study , hypothesize use silver alginate dress population efficacious prevention blood stream infection . Although initial study suggest absorb silver range toxic human infant , continue monitor silver level certain infant .</detailed_description>
