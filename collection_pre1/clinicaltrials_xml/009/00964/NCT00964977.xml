	<detailed_description>Background Prevailing curative intend therapeutic strategy combine radical resection tumor mass safety margin follow radiation original tumor site adjacent locoregional lymphatic drainage area . To date selection individual therapeutic pattern essentially guide pre- post-therapeutic TNM stag parameter . Exceptionally advanced tumor postoperative radiotherapy optional combination ( radiosensitizing ) chemotherapeutic agent favorable recommend . Interdisciplinary guideline state follow detailed recommendation application adjuvant radiation therapy : - non sano resection reoperation impossible ( R1- , R2-status ) - primary tumor status &gt; pT2 pN2 , pN3 - extranodular spread disease - lymphangiosis carcinomatosa - facultative : pN1 According recommendation postoperative radiotherapy advance tumor feasible small tumor indication adjuvant therapy depend parameter like pN finding . Here verification one singular lymph node metastasis ( pN2 ) lead additional radiotherapy . In tumor diameter less 4 cm ( T1 , T2 ) concomitant verification single lymph node metastasis explicit therapeutic recommendation offer date displaying radiation optional complement case . Meta-Analysis revealed study take special group patient account state adjuvant radiotherapy additional risk factor overall survival , however small patient number , inhomogeneous group distribution ambiguous risk factor exhibit significant bias . The methodological key problem address protocol following : - extremely different treatment arm strong preference one therapy arm - low number eligible patient per center - Inclusion criterion ( pN1 ) include pathological diagnosis surgical treatment possible difference - Radiation treatment one arm special need quality control Thus idea present paper , discuss specific issue take care . Methods/Design Study Design The study design non-blinded , prospective , randomize control clinical trial . Study objectives Objective clinical study investigation two different patient collective ( irradiated/unirradiated ) pT1/2 primary verification singular ipsilateral lymph node metastasis parallel design order evaluate possible significant benefit radiation therapy . Investigation biological parameter concomitantly perform assess possible prediction tumor progression evaluate surrogate marker radioresistance . The following null hypothesis form basis present study : Radiation therapy influence overall survival patient pT1/2 , pN1 primary tumor . Secondary outcome variable include incidence time tumor relapse ( locoregional relapse , lymph node involvement metastatic spread ) , Quality life report EORTC ( QLQ-C30 H &amp; N 35 module ) time operation orofacial rehabilitation . Patients Males females histological verified diagnosis primary squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity oropharynx eligible . Inclusion criterion follow : - maximum tumor diameter le 4 cm pathohistological specimen irrespective histological grading ( pT1 pT2 ) - concomitant histological verification singular ipsilateral lymph node metastasis le 3cm diameter ( pN1 ) without penetration lymph node´s capsule without presence lymphangiosis carcinomatosa - radical resection tumor within adequate resection margin ( R0 ) - write informed consent patient - adequate performance status ECOG Index ≤ 2 Patients age le 18 pregnant woman exclude . Further criterion exclusion report drug addiction intake remedy potential influence compliance impair judgment . In addition patient mental disorder conceivable physical , familial job related embarrassment may preclude patient realize study schedule . Moreover patient physical impairment inadequate treatment derail disease e.g . untreated diabetes mellitus acute heart insufficiency ( ECOG-Index &gt; 2 ) . Study intervention Radiotherapy begin within 6 week last surgical intervention , whereas minimal postoperative healing period least 8 day respect . Causes delay intervention document . Application radiotherapy defines group 1 versus non irradiate group ( group 2 ) . Surgical treatment The primary consider radically resect macroscopic histologic evaluation approve resection margin without tumor residual ( R0 status ) . For surgical proceeding safety margin least 1cm establish . For surgical consideration lymph node resection tumor localization divide level I ( occlusional plane ) level II ( occlusional plane ) respect pre- , postcanine retromolar find addition . Classification cervical region follow recommendation Robbins 2002 . Hence , neck divide 6 different section . Ipsilateral N0 state cervical lymph node Pre- postcanine localize tumor level I require selective neck dissection cervical level 1-3 . In level I tumours retromolar triangle selective neck dissection ipsilateral level 1-5 proceed . In level II tumor selective neck dissection consider . Contralateral N0 state No neck dissection perform Ipsilateral N1- N2 state For retromolar localized level I tumors modified radical neck dissection perform . If tumor localize pre- postcanine intraoperative frozen section level 1 lymph node evaluate . Positive intraoperative result lead modified radical resection level 1-5 lymph node . In case negative result resection lymph node within level 1-3 affiliate . Negative instantaneous section level II tumor require lymph node dissection . All metastatic affection level II-III lymph node necessitates modify radical neck dissection . Contralateral N1-N2 state Instantaneous section perform level 1 lymph node . Modified radical neck dissection perform positive , resection level 1-3 lymph node conduct negative result . Metastases spread level 2-3 lymph node acquire modify radical neck dissection . Lymph node therapy midline tumor Midline tumor may require bilateral resection lymph node echelon risk . Bilateral modify neck dissection perform staging purpose indicate . Contralateral lymph node dissection level 1-3 precanine localize tumor mandatory . Technical condition practical execution radiation therapy Radiotherapy perform photon 4 to10 MeV or/and electron 6 15 MeV maximum energy . Individual 3 dimensional dose distribution calculation mandatory make basis postoperative native computer tomogram . All patient treat immobilized custom make face mask make thermoplast equivalent . Clinical target volume definition compass original tumor site safety margin 2 cm direction . Floor mouth , anterior tongue Irradiation anterior two third tongue well anterior floor mouth irradiated lateral oppose beam , maxilla separate insertion bite block . Oropharynx , buccal plane , soft palate confine one side For tumor buccal plane , tonsilla , soft palate retromolar triangle two type plan target volume may apply . In case negative contralateral cervical node ipsilateral target volume primary define include lymph node group IB , IIA IIB . Irradiation technique recommend two wedge field typically angulate 90 120 degree . The ipsilateral node level III-V treat anterior portal clavicle . The contralateral neck spar . Tumors lateral dorsal pharyngeal wall lymphatic drainage ( level II , III , IV V ) irradiate bilaterally oppose beam . Irrespective technique use 3 D conformal dose shape highly recommend . Dosage fractionation Target volume definition dosage perform accord rule ICRU report 50 . At primary tumor site involve lymph node level total dose 59.4 Gy 33 fraction within 45 day schedule . At electively irradiate volume total dose 50.4 Gy 28 fraction schedule . All fraction 1.8 Gy give five time per week . In case machine break additional fraction per week recommend least 6 h interval two fraction day Saturday . Total treatment duration ( include planned/unplanned interruption ) document day . Any patient must available intent treat analysis . Instead classical portal arrangement dose distribution intensity modulate radiotherapy use inverse calculation algorithm may use experienced center . Dose constraint normal tissue discretion participate center . Dose specification accord RTOG protocol H 0022 recommend . Details give standard operation procedure . Follow-Up Recruitment phase 4 year physical examination , ECOG index , quality life questionnaire perform 3 , 6 12 month end radiation . Further follow perform annually 5 year obtain sufficient clinical data . Randomization Sample Size The present study setup consist two armed randomize control trial ( RCT ) primary study aim . Patients reject participation randomize approach preference certain procedure ( radiation/no radiation ) include prospective observational study give informed consent . This parallel construct observational trial perform maximum consistency treatment observation compare RCT . In case positive attendance patient randomize , stratify criterion adequate lymph node therapy ( yes/no ) formulate DOESAK . Randomization group ( radiation group/control group ) 1 to1 . Patients recruit period 4 year follow-up annually trial end , i.e . least 5 year patient . Sample size calculation perform two-sided log rank test significance level 5 % . Assuming exponential distributed survival survival probabilities 5 year 45 % within control group 55 % within radiation group ( result observe DOESAK collective ) drop-out rate 5 % per year , 280 patient per group require detect significant difference overall survival power 70 % . In case impaired patient recruitment within randomize trial , intend recruit least 280 patient per group observational study . Analysis RCT observational trial Initiation trial arguable realistic chance statistical evaluation adequate count randomize patient . Hence intermediate assessment attendance randomization perform first second year recruitment . If less 5 % patient agree randomization within first 10 % within second year RCT stop study continue solely observational trial ( see table 1 ) . Intermediate assessment perform presumption accelerate involvement achieve minimum 20 % randomized patient recruitment phase . As consequence study design two different collective ( randomize collective/ collective preferred form therapy ) exist . The following scenario analysis possible : 1 . If sufficient number patient randomize , treatment comparison perform within randomize collective . The non-randomized collective use evaluate external validity observe treatment effect . 2 . If sufficient number patient could randomize , recruit patient analyze . Descriptive comparison treatment group perform baseline variable . All analysis perform adjustment baseline variable affect survival . Results interpreted respect group difference baseline variable . Outcome measurement Primary clinical endpoint Overall survival Secondary clinical endpoint Incidence tumor relapse - Time occurrence lymphatic metastasis - Time occurrence local relapse - Time occurrence distant metastases - Tumor related death due local tumor progression metastatic spread Life quality - Time provisional orofacial rehabilitation - Time operation first intermediate prosthesis intake - Time operation definitive prosthesis application - Life Quality report ( EORTC QLQ-C30 H &amp; N 35 module ) Overall survival evaluate Cox proportional hazard model treatment adequate lymph node therapy ( yes/no ) covariates . Further covariates may consider affect survival .</detailed_description>
