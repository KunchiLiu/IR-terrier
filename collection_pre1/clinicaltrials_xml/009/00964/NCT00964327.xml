	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine antiviral activity , safety tolerability 14 day different dos TMC114 treat HIV-1 positive patient whose condition fail current treatment regimen include protease inhibitor ( PI ) ( medication use reduce amount HIV virus blood ) .To consider study , patient must document resistance least 2 current PIs . Pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics TMC114 also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC114-C201 : A Study Determine Antiviral Activity TMC114 Patients With Multiple Protease Inhibitor ( PI ) Resistant Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Strains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase lla open-label ( people involve know identity treatment ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , control ( patient control group continue fail regimen ) , dose-finding study determine antiviral activity , safety tolerability 14-day treatment TMC114 ( protease inhibitor ) treatment human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) positive patient consider resistant ( fail improve ) 2 protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . Sixty HIV-1 positive patient , resistant multiple PIs confirm specialized testing ( virtual phenotyping ) currently fail improve treatment regimen contain PI , randomly assign one 5 treatment group . Those randomized control group continue current therapy ( consist PIs Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor ( ) ( NRTIs ) ) . Those randomized TMC114 treatment group receive study drug substitute PIs current fail treatment regimen follow dose level : 400 800 mg twice day , 800 1200 mg three time day 13 day follow single dose day 14 . The dose NRTIs ( NRTIs drug suppress replication retrovirus ) remain unchanged end treatment period . The trial involve screen period maximum three week , 7-day run-in period ( period time study start treatment give ) , 14-day treatment period , follow 6- week follow-up period . The maximal trial duration thus twelve week . Primary objective determine antiviral activity TMC114 well pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body remove body time ) pharmacodynamics ( study action effect drug body ) also assess 2 week period.Safety follow regular interval treatment follow-up period . Safety assessment consist regular lab assessment , ECG recording , vital sign , physical examination , body weight Body Mass Index . Observation interview adverse event do daily first week treatment , every second day 2nd week treatment , week 1 , 3 6 follow-up period . In addition Independent Data Monitoring Committee evaluate study data regular interval . Patients randomly assign one 5 treatment group : 400 800 mg twice day 13 day follow single dose day 14 , 800 1200 mg three time day 13 day follow single dose day 14 . Patients randomize control group continue current therapy consist protease inhibitor ( PIs ) Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .</detailed_description>
