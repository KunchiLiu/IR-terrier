	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify validate probe cocktail use future drug-drug interaction study . Cytochrome P450 enzymes transport protein play important role disposition drug . Changes activity pathway assess use probe drug select basis metabolic transport pathway . This two part study subject participate part decrease variability data . The purpose Part 1 identify set probe drug ( 'cocktail ' ) interact one another ; group healthy volunteer receive 7 probe drug individually combination 7 drug give together cocktail . Part 2 assess performance probe cocktail use three know inhibitor ( validation ) . The inhibitor plus probe cocktail evaluate ability newly establish cocktail accurately quantify metabolize enzyme transporter inhibition , represent fundamental advance probe cocktail validation utility drug development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Study Multiple Probe Compounds Drug Interaction Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study establish validate drug cocktail , contain 7 probe , assess activity six drug metabolize enzyme ( CYP 1A2 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4/5 ) OATP1B1 transporter . In Part 1 , study determine pharmacokinetic interaction among probe drug compare pharmacokinetics probe drug administer alone combination ( i.e. , cocktail ) . In Part 2 , study evaluate quantitative performance cocktail examine effect select inhibitor pharmacokinetics respective probe drug probe drug administer alone versus administer cocktail . This study aim establish standard probe cocktail use drug-drug interaction study , intention subset 7-drug cocktail could select study drug development . In addition , study provide proof-of-principle evaluation dry blood spot technology method measure drug concentration blood sample collect clinical study .</detailed_description>
