	<brief_title>Depocyt® With Sorafenib Neoplastic Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After Ommaya reservoir place patient 's head , patient receive DepoCyt reservoir every 2 week 5 dos , every 4 week additional 5 dos ( total 10 DepoCyt treatment ) . Patients also receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice day throughout treatment course disease progression death . Patients receive brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRIs ) contrast ( whole spine , necessary ) spinal fluid study obtain every 8 week Ommaya reservoir disease progression , death , unacceptable toxicity . In addition , patient spinal fluid obtain test sorafenib level study visit start sorafenib well prior sorafenib treatment control .</detailed_description>
