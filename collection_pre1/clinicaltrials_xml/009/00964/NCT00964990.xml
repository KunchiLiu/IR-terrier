	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability JNJ-42160443 Patients With Neuropathic Pain ( Postherpetic Neuralgia Post-traumatic Neuralgia )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither study doctor patient know name assigned drug ) , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability JNJ-42160443 patient postherpetic neuralgia post-traumatic neuralgia , follow double blind extension open-label ( study doctor patient know name study drug ) extension . This study evaluate safety effectiveness JNJ-42160443 treatment patient moderate severe , chronic , neuropathic pain control without standard pain therapy diagnosis postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) post-traumatic neuralgia . The total duration study approximately 130 week ( i.e. , include screen phase , 12-week double-blind efficacy phase , double-blind safety extension phase , open-label safety extension phase ) . During 12 week treatment 40 week double-blind extension phase , PHN patient receive Placebo , JNJ 42160443 1 , 3 , 10 mg post-traumatic neuralgia patient receive placebo JNJ-42160443 10 mg ; dose give single , subcutaneous ( skin ) ( SC ) injection every 28 day . During 52-week open-label extension phase , patient receive single SC injection JNJ-42160443 10 mg every 4 , 8 , 12 week .</detailed_description>
