	<brief_summary>This study conduct assess effect GSK1014802 positive control , lidocaine , test peripheral nerve excitability . This double blind , placebo control , 4-period cross study . Approximately 20 subject randomise one two dos GSK1014802 , lidocaine placebo least 2 week session . A follow-up occur 7-15 day last dose . During treatment session 3 6th October 2009 , one subject pattern AEs severe intensity , suggestive brain stem toxicity / encephalopathy lidocaine/saline infusion period . Although recognised literature lidocaine use patient treatment pain , AEs unusual study healthy subject . The study suspend allow re-evaluation risk : benefit balance lidocaine/saline infusion healthy subject study . It decide continuation use lidocaine ( positive control ) would risk safety subject . Continuation without positive control possible would compromise scientific integrity design .</brief_summary>
