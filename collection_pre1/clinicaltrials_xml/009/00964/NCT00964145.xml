	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize levator ani structure ( pubovaginalis , puboperinealis , puboanalis , puborectalis , iliococcygeous ) use 3-D ultrasonography nulliparous woman 21-70 year old . Hypothesis 1 : Prevalence abnormality levator ani muscle structure associate increase age independent vaginal parity . To investigate age-related symptom pelvic floor dysfunction nulliparous , woman 21-70 year old . Hypothesis 2 : Anatomical abnormality levator ani muscle associate symptomatic pelvic floor dysfunction . To investigate age-related pelvic floor function nulliparous , woman 21-70 year old . Hypothesis 3 : Age-related anatomical abnormality levator ani muscle associate levator ani muscle weakness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study age-related change levator ani muscle . We explore 3-D anatomical architecture muscle asymptomatic female age 21-70 year old . Subjects meet eligibility criterion schedule clinic study visit inform consent obtain . At visit , subject ask complete self administer pelvic floor symptom impact measure questionnaire ( PFDI , PFIQ PISQ-12 ) , well quality life measure ( SF-12 ) . At clinic study visit , complete history obtain include subject 's gynecologic history include age , menopausal status , medical surgical history interview . A standardized examination perform , include height , weight , pelvic floor support assessment use pelvic organ prolapse quantification system ( POP-Q ) . Body mass index calculate . Levator function assess use instrumented vaginal speculum . Vaginal closure force measure rest maximal voluntary contraction . At completion exam speculum examination , participant undergo endovaginal 3-D ultrasound ( BK medical , Wilmington , MA ) , study visit . The endovaginal ultrasound technique describe previously . The technique summarize follow : A length six cm scan 60 second scan every 0.25 mm cumulative 240 scan 3-D render cube calculate . Each 3-D cube digitally catalogue future analysis . The ultrasound cube review two reviewer ( LHQ SAS ) , blind identity volunteer score reviewer . Reviewers score muscle base individual muscle visualization origin - insertion point . The levator ani muscle scan examine visibility puboperinealis , puboanalis pubovaginalis division levator ani muscle . Other structure , superficial transverse perinei , puborectalis iliococcygeous muscle also identify . A scoring system previously develop accord morphology clarity subdivision 's origin-insertion point . The characteristic feature levator subdivision determine follow two criterion : A clear visible separation adjacent structure , , Differing origin-insertion point muscle . An exemplary scan 25 year-old nulliparous woman select image clarity base described classification method . According score system , score 0 give muscle pair correspond `` muscle damage '' score 18 corresponds `` complete muscle loss '' subdivision . Next , 3-D PowerPoint library create describe structure need identify . The blinded reviewer may confirm identity structure manipulate plane 3-D cube trace entire muscle subdivision look origin-insertion point .</detailed_description>
