	<brief_summary>The ongoing study Phase II , open-label study evaluate efficacy MBP-426 dose 170 mg/m2 combination therapy patient second line metastatic gastric , gastro-esophageal junction esophageal adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study MBP-426 Patients With Second Line Gastric , Gastroesophageal , Esophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study start Phase Ib portion , dose 226 mg/m2 , dose good tolerability demonstrate Phase I trial . A cohort may enrol 301 mg/m2 , 226 mg/m2 well tolerate . The dose determine Phase Ib portion study evaluate Phase II portion . This design permit evaluation true positive negative response limit exposure patient study drug . If regimen offer positive response , reduce toxicity potentially great efficacy may yield good outcome patient require second-line therapy UGI cancer . Following completion Phase Ib part present trial , dose recommend use Phase II part 170 mg/m2 MBP-426 .</detailed_description>

Adequate organ system function : Bone marrow : ANC ≥1500/mm3 , platelet count ≥100000/mm3 , Hb ≥9 g/dL ; Coagulation : PT &lt; 1.3 x ULN , PTT &gt; LLN , &lt; 1.1 x ULN Renal : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institution 's ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 ; Hepatic : Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL , ALT AST ≤2.5 x ULN ( 5 x ULN ) , ALP ≤2.5 x ULN ( 5 x ULN ) . 6 . Recovered ≤Gr 1 acute toxicity cause prior cancer therapy except residual toxicity pose ongoing medical risk . 7 . If childbearing potential , agree use effective method contraception prior study entry , duration study , 30 day last dose MBP426 FA/5FU . A negative pregnancy test must document baseline . Patients may breastfeed study . 8 . Have ability maintain central IV access . 9 . Able comply protocol treatment procedure . 10 . Provide write informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep institution 's policy . Phase II : 1 . Inoperable , histologically , cytologically confirm , locally advanced metastatic gastric , GE junction , esophageal adenocarcinoma recur progress follow 1 prior chemotherapy . 2 . Measurable disease define RECIST . If recurrence document follow radiation therapy , recurrence must occur outside radiation field . Lesions locate within previously irradiate field consider measurable . 3 . ECOG performance status : 0 1 . 4 . Identical criterion number 310 Phase Ib portion study . Exclusion Criteria ( Phase Ib II ) : 1 . Major surgery within 14 day prior study enrollment . 2 . Radiotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent within 30 day enrollment ( 6 week mitomycin C ) . A washout require chemotherapy , antibodies small molecule , equivalent least 5 halflives 30 day , whichever short , prior study entry . Concurrent use bisphosphonates permit . 3 . Have past current 2nd primary malignancy ( except situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin , malignancy treat least 3 year previously surgery and/or radiotherapy evidence recurrence since time ) . 4 . Known clinical evidence CNS metastasis . 5 . Receiving highdose steroid dexamethasoneequivalent dose 4 mg/day . 6 . Current active infection require antiinfectious treatment . 7 . Significant intercurrent illness would compromise safety patient compromise ability patient complete study . 8 . Documented known hematologic malignancy and/or bleed disorder . 9 . Peripheral neuropathy ≥Gr 2 ( NCICTCAE , Ver . 3.0 ) . 10 . Any requirement ( ) therapeutic anticoagulation increase INR aPTT normal range ( low dose DVT line prophylaxis allow ) . 11 .
