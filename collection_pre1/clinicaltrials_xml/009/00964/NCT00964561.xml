	<brief_title>Ph1 Study Valortim Ciprofloxacin Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Valortim ( MDX-1303 ) fully human monoclonal antibody ( hmAb ) high affinity B. anthracis protective antigen ( PA ) . Valortim design target PA , one three plasmid-encoded protein together form toxin release B. anthracis . Individually , proteins ( protective antigen ( PA ) , lethal factor ( LF ) edema factor ( EF ) ) inactive . Toxic effect require transport LF EF host cell , mediate activity PA. Valortim bind PA interfere activity toxin . Based non-clinical clinical data , Valortim may utility pre- post-exposure prophylaxis individual expose , risk exposure , B. anthracis treatment individual display sign symptom inhalational anthrax . Because treatment inhalational anthrax include use antibiotic fluoroquinolones , necessary demonstrate adverse interaction newer therapeutic intervention medication . The purpose study assess safety pharmacokinetics ciprofloxacin ( commonly use fluoroquinolone treatment post-exposure prophylaxis anthrax ) Valortim follow co-administration , well safety tolerability medication administer concomitantly . These data intend support use Valortim treatment inhalational anthrax .</detailed_description>
