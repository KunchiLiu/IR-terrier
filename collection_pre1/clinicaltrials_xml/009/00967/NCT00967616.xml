	<criteria>Metastatic CRC progress follow firstline therapy . Measurable disease ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] , Version 1.0.34 . Male female = 18 year age . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = 2 . Resolution toxic effect prior therapy ( except alopecia ) NCI CTCAE , Version 3.0 , grade = 1 . Adequate organ bone marrow function evidence : Hemoglobin = 9 g/dL ( transfusion and/or growth factor support allow ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) = 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count = 100 x 109/L Serum creatinine = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance = 60 mL/min Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase = 2.5 x ULN subject liver metastasis = 5.0 x ULN subject liver metastasis Total bilirubin = 1.5 x ULN Women childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception ( eg , hormonal contraceptive , bilateral tubal ligation , barrier spermicide , intrauterine device ) treatment least 3 month thereafter . Men partner woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception ( e.g. , vasectomy barrier spermicide ) treatment 3 month thereafter . All female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) result initiate study treatment . Subjects must fully inform illness investigational nature study protocol ( include foreseeable risk possible side effect ) must sign date IEC IRBapproved ICF ( include HIPAA authorization , applicable ) performance studyspecific procedure test . Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Firstline treatment irinotecanbased regimen ( eg , FOLFIRI ) . Anticipation need major surgical procedure radiation therapy ( RT ) study . Treatment chemotherapy , TZDs , RT , surgery , immunotherapy , biological therapy , investigational anticancer agent within 4 week start study treatment . History follow condition within 6 month initiate study treatment : Diabetes mellitus require treatment insulin TZD agents Myocardial infarction significant impairment cardiac function ( e.g. , ejection fraction = 50 % ) Severe/unstable angina pectoris Coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV congestive heart failure Malabsorption syndrome , chronic diarrhea ( last &gt; 4 week ) , inflammatory bowel disease , partial bowel obstruction . Subjects clinically active brain metastasis ( define untreated , symptomatic , require therapy steroid anticonvulsant control associate symptom ) ; uncontrolled seizure disorder ; spinal cord compression ; carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects treat brain metastasis include study recover acute , toxic effect RT . A minimum 15 day must elapse end RT enrollment study . History malignancy CRC , unless expectation malignancy cure , tumorspecific treatment malignancy administer within previous 5 year . Clinically significant , severe , active infection require IV antibiotic antiviral agent . Pericardial pleural effusion ( eg , require drainage ) pericardial involvement tumor . Subjects minimal pleural effusion may eligible upon request Investigator approval Sponsor . Need concomitant use TZDs study . Previous administration CS7017 . Pregnant breast feeding . Known homozygous UGT1A1*28 allele . Known history severe hypersensitivity reaction component CS7017 , irinotecan , leucovorin , 5FU . Serious intercurrent medical psychiatric illness condition opinion Investigator would impair ability give inform consent unacceptably reduce protocol compliance safety study treatment .</criteria>
