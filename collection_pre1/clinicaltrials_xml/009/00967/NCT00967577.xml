	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate change tumor blood flow disease response investigation agent , 177Lu-J591 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>177Lu-J591 Antibody Patients With Nonprostate Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>177Lu-J591 make two compound call J591 177Lutetium ( 177Lu ) join together connect molecule call `` DOTA '' . J591 monoclonal antibody , type protein . 177Lu radioactive molecule test possible treatment cancer join monoclonal antibody . J591 attach protein call prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) find body . PSMA mostly find normal cancerous prostate cell . In addition , however , PSMA also find vasculature ( blood vessel ) supply multiple type cancer include colorectal , kidney , bladder , head neck , breast , non-small cell lung , pancreas , ovary , esophagus glioma . We hope 177Lu-J591 seek blood vessel supply tumor deliver dose radiation ( 177Lu molecule ) area cancer , without affect target blood vessel associate cancer . Zirconium-89 ( 89Zr ) radioactive tracer allow special scan perform prior administration study drug determine antibody go body screen tumor 's blood vessel see attract J591 . Again , DOTA use join radioactive material J591 . 89Zr-J591 give treat cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically , cytologically document , advanced stage , malignant adult solid tumor ( except prostate cancer ) refractory , recurrent , standard therapy curative standard therapy exist . This include , limited patient cancer kidney , urothelium , head neck , breast , nonsmall cell lung , colorectal , pancreas , ovary , esophagus glioma . Metastatic recurrent solid tumor malignancy define abnormal CT , MRI , PET scan , CXR and/or bone scan Progressive disease manifest : Development new lesion increase size preexist lesion image study physical examination . Subjects must recover acute toxicity prior therapy , receive chemotherapy , radiation therapy investigational anticancer therapeutic drug least 4 week prior J591 administration trial All subject must archive current tissue ( primary metastatic focus ) available PSMA determination . Subjects bisphosphonate therapy denosumab must stable dose must start therapy &gt; 4 week prior protocol therapy . Subjects inform potential risk procreation participate trial advise use effective contraception entire study period . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Use red blood cell platelet transfusion within 4 week treatment . Use hematopoietic growth factor within 4 week treatment . Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 4 week treatment . Prior radiation therapy encompass &gt; 25 % skeleton . Prior treatment 89Strontium 153Samarium contain compound ( e.g . Metastron® , Quadramet® ) Platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm3 history platelet count abnormality dysfunction .
