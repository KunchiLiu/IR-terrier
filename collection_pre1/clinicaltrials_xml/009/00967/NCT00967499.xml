	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Palonosetron Versus Ondansetron Rescue Medication Subjects That Develop Postoperative Nausea Vomiting ( PONV ) Postanesthesia Care Unit ( PACU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) frequent complication surgery , lead subject discomfort dissatisfaction well considerable subsequent medical economic consequence . In multi-center , open-label , parallel , randomized , pilot study , outpatient surgical patient experience post-operative nausea vomit PACU stratify gender randomly assign either palonosetron HCl 0.075 mg IV ondansetron 4 mg IV minimization random allocation . Male female outpatient , schedule elective laparoscopic abdominal gynecological surgery general endotracheal anesthesia enrol . All subject ask attend 2 visit study center : 1 . Screening ( Days -14 -1 ) 2 . Treatment ( Day 1 , day surgical procedure randomization ) Subjects treated receive follow-up telephone call Study Coordinator Study Day 4 5 review subject diary completion , review adverse event , concomitant medication , prior subject return complete diary site . At Screening visit , subject provide inform consent undergo clinical assessment . Demographic baseline characteristic , include entrance criterion determination , medical history , history PONV and/or currently prone motion sickness , smoke status , prior concomitant medication , physical examination , vital sign document . On day surgery , subject meet eligibility criterion prophylactically treat prior anesthesia ondansetron 4 mg IV , preoperative antiemetic treatment . As clinically indicate rescue therapy , subject experience nausea severity score ≥4 11-point NRS , vomiting , indicate subject request receive blind study medication first line rescue therapy PONV PACU 6 hour PACU admission . Subjects require rescue medication need dose within 10 minute identify need rescue medication . In effort ensure timeline exceed , sit allow randomize subject prior surgery , day surgery . Subjects randomized require rescue therapy therefore dose study drug , consider 'Subjects randomize treat ' . Subject diary use record date time study drug administration , reason administer rescue medication , baseline emetic symptom immediately prior administration rescue medication , occurrence emetic episode , severity duration nausea , subject function evaluation nausea emesis assess accord modify Osoba questionnaire ( Martin et . al . 2003 ) . The baseline assessment perform prior administer rescue medication must indicate least one follow condition meet : 1. subject nausea severity score ≥4 11-point ( 0-10 ) NRS 2. vomit 3. subject request : subject request must approve site staff must base either nausea emesis symptom</detailed_description>
