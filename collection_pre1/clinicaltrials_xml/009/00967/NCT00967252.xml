	<brief_summary>Despite improvement perioperative care , non-cardiac surgery remain associated significant costly complication . Analysis perioperative death United Kingdom suggest roughly 80 % directly attributable infectious cardiovascular complication . The best available evidence suggest medical optimization prefer strategy reduce cardiac risk novel strategy reduce nosocomial infection rate 20 year . Emerging evidence non-operative operative setting suggest statin drug may prevent infectious cardiac event . The mechanism ( ) action entirely clear appear independent lipid lower effect often refer pleiotropic effect . Two key element pleiotropic effect statin appear anti-inflammatory property improve endothelial vascular reactivity . The statin dose require maximize effect unknown . A large observational trial suggest contradictory dose effect high dos associate reduce infectious complication low dos associate few cardiac complication . Doctors therefore still many unanswered question use statin perioperative setting . Should routinely start certain surgical patient ? What dose statin use ? If patient already statin , dose alter perioperatively ? The latter question particularly relevant light mark increase statin use . Recruitment log ongoing trial demonstrate 70 % patient undergoing high-risk surgery take statin markedly variable dos . This population present ideal opportunity determine dose response relationship statins pleiotropic effect . We therefore propose observational study determine anti-inflammatory endothelial effect high-risk surgical patient vary dos perioperative statin drug . Atorvastatin diminishes rise C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , measure 48 hour elective vascular surgery , dose dependent fashion . Secondary Hypotheses : Atorvastatin reduce endothelial dysfunction elective vascular surgery , measure brachial artery ultrasound , dose dependent fashion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate approximately 1.7 million surgical procedure perform year Canada . Unfortunately , perioperative complication uncommon occurrence substantial morbidity , mortality cost associate . To date , best strategy reduce nosocomial infection aseptic practice , timely prophylactic antibiotic good surgical technique . Despite strategy , estimate least 1 5 major vascular surgical patient type nosocomial infection within 30 day procedure . The direct indirect mortality infection population difficult estimate nosocomial infection estimate contribute least 15 % mortality hospitalize patient . The primary manner infection contribute patient mortality progression sepsis . Sepsis tenth lead cause death Canadians worldwide increase incidence severity . The associated mortality sepsis varies population infection source usually 30-60 % . Despite significant improvement management sepsis last 5 year , still generally effective preventive medication strategy . Although cardiovascular complication , include myocardial infarction heart failure , less common 15 % major vascular patient , stagger mortality around 30-50 % . Clearly , strategies therapy reduce complication could profound benefit . The question therefore whether statin drug reduce sepsis , cardiovascular complication , , , might . Understanding pathophysiology sepsis acute coronary syndrome non-operative setting lead tremendous advancement management . In sepsis , excessive , inappropriate misguide response host defense response likely responsible . Massive cytokine release exacerbate endothelium dysfunction impact coagulation , thrombolysis , inflammation , tissue repair tissue growth . If correct , endothelial cell either die directly trigger apoptosis . This lead multiorgan dysfunction ultimately death . How sepsis ultimately impairs damage endothelial cell function likely multifactoral . Impairment endothelial nitric oxide synthetase occur cause impaired perfusion inappropriate microvasculature coagulation . In strikingly similar manner sepsis , key element acute coronary syndrome appear inflammation endothelial dysfunction . Rupture coronary plaque thrombosis central . Although perioperative myocardial event traditionally say supply-demand problem , theory dispute evidence suggest perioperative problem similar non-operative event . Elevated level various inflammatory marker , particularly C-Reactive Protein , associate adverse cardiovascular event . Similarly , vascular endothelium responsible regulating vasomotor tone , thrombosis , platelet leukocyte interaction . Dysfunction endothelium also believe central component development coronary complication . Although endothelial dysfunction extensively investigated perioperative setting , pathophysiologic similarity make probable perioperative endothelial dysfunction contributes occurrence perioperative myocardial event . Thus , strategy design control perioperative inflammation , well improve endothelial function stabilize coronary plaque potential reduce perioperative coronary infectious event . Although study animal human strongly suggest statin may prevent treat sepsis , prospective randomize trial human conducted demonstrate effect . Although statin demonstrate directly attenuate replication infectivity microorganism , evidence primarily suggest statin indeed protective likely due anti-inflammatory favorable endothelial effect . Improvement endothelial function statin suggest prevent cardiac event stabilize coronary plaque may even contribute plaque regression . Statins restore endothelial production endogenous nitric oxide synthetase thus improve organ perfusion microvasculature thrombosis impair set sepsis . The goal propose trial , STAR VaS II therefore twofold : First , help determine statin blunts adverse perioperative change inflammation endothelial function dose-dependent fashion . Second , determine patient chronically low maximal statin dose dose increase perioperative period . We evaluate influence varying dose statin perioperative inflammation , assess C-reactive protein , endothelial function assess brachial artery ultrasound . If atorvastatin , chronically administer surgery , improve inflammatory change endothelial function dose dependent fashion , plausible patient chronically low statin dos dose increased perioperative period . If however patient low dos experience similar benefit , high dos , conceivably recommend perioperative dose could lower thereby theoretically improve risk-benefit ratio statin drug . All patient assess infection define CDC .</detailed_description>
