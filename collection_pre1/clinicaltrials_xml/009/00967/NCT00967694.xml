	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn breathe nitrous oxide ( also know `` laugh gas '' ) change pressure person 's eye . Some patient need regular eye exam measure eye pressure often need put sleep medicine order complete eye exam . Some medicine know cause change person 's eye pressure . Because , medicine avoid eye doctor need measure patient 's eye pressure . One medicine frequently use put patient sleep nitrous oxide . No one really know effect nitrous oxide might person ' eye pressure . The investigator interested see nitrous oxide cause increase , decrease , change eye pressure . The investigator also want investigate difference effect nitrous oxide eye pressure male female . Understanding effect nitrous oxide important eye exam , eye doctor use pressure measurement make important decision treatment surgery option patient . The investigator hypothesize use inhale nitrous oxide ( N2O ) result decrease IOP healthy volunteer . The investigator aim determine magnitude duration change , , IOP cause inhalation N2O , assess gender patient role effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An initial pre-anesthetic evaluation physical examination perform attending anesthesiologist , eye exam perform attend ophthalmologist determine suitability inclusion accord criterion . Ideally eye exam take place immediately prior conduction study . However , logistical restraint may require eye exam take place separate time/date prior conduction study . IOPs measure attend ophthalmologist ( B.E . ) blind actual reading Tonopen mean small screen , single train observer ( E.F. ) record observation Tonopen . The nitrous oxide sedation manage attend anesthesiologist ( K.L. ) . All patient monitor throughout use standardized monitoring ( continuous EKG , non-invasive BP , continuous pulse oximetry ) .</detailed_description>
