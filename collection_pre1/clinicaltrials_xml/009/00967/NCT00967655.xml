	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give capecitabine panitumumab together radiation therapy without irinotecan hydrochloride see well work treat patient undergo surgery localize rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Panitumumab , Radiation Therapy With Without Irinotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery Localized Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess pathological tumor response rate patient localize rectal cancer treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise capecitabine , panitumumab , radiotherapy without irinotecan hydrochloride . - To assess incidence grade 3/4 toxicity neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Secondary - To assess disease-free survival . - To assess time treatment failure . - To assess the1-year 2-year survival rate . - To assess local recurrence , define recurrence pelvis site previous disease . - To assess safety toxicity grade use NCI CTCAE v3.0 criterion . - To assess number percentage patient undergo stag disease determine initiate neoadjuvant therapy time surgery . - To assess number percentage patient permanent colostomy avoid determine surgeon initiate neoadjuvant therapy time actual surgery perform . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Phase A : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 day week 5½ week . Patients also receive panitumumab IV 1 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 radiotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Phase B : Patients undergo radiotherapy receive capecitabine panitumumab Phase A . Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 6-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
