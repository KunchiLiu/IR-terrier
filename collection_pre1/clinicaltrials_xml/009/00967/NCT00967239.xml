	<brief_title>Study Blood Samples From High-Risk Postmenopausal Women Who Received Treatment Breast Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials NSABP-P-1 NSABP-P-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify gene associate breast event ( i.e. , occurrence invasive breast cancer ductal carcinoma situ ) , term single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) genome-wide association study , Caucasian woman high risk develop breast cancer receive selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) ( i.e. , tamoxifen raloxifene ) NSABP-P-1 OR NSABP-P-2 breast cancer prevention clinical trial . - To determine impact CYP2D6 metabolizer status , include genotype status concurrent use CYP2D6 inhibitor , breast cancer event participant receive either tamoxifen raloxifene . Secondary - To explore whether multiple SNPs within region independently associate breast event . - To explore whether interaction among SNPs increase risk breast event . - To explore whether interaction SNPs identify primary objective randomize treatment , term risk breast event . - To identify rare variant might affect estrogen-dependent expression chromosome ( CTSO ) 4 16 ( ZNF423 ) and/or relationship BRCA1 expression . OUTLINE : Samples stratify accord CYP2D6 genotype CYP2D6 metabolizer status . DNA extract previously collect blood sample analyze genome-wide association study compare 2 control sample patient experience breast event . DNA sample use identify analyze single nucleotide polymorphism . Also , exploratory analysis conduct examine impact CYP2D6 metabolizer status breast cancer event accord invasive v non-invasive disease , ER status , PgR status , histologic type , TMN stage .</detailed_description>
