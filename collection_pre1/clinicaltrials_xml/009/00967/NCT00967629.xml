	<brief_title>Effect Sevelamer Carbonate Oxidative Stress Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional vascular risk factor alone account elevated cardiovascular risk patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . In addition high prevalence hypertension diabetes , patient CKD elevate level inflammatory marker OS , emerge important risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Patients CKD also know elevated level circulate advanced glycation end product ( AGE 's ) , show induce OS play central role development diabetic microvascular macrovascular complication . In CKD patient , AGE 's accumulate secondary decrease renal clearance increase endogenous production set high level OS . Efforts understand relationship multiple vascular risk factor chronic kidney disease may lead reduce morbidity mortality population patient . Sevelamer Hydrochloride anion exchange resin compose multiple positively charge amine group indicate treatment hyperphosphatemia patient stage V CKD . The positively charge amine group bind negatively charge dietary phosphate prevent systemic absorption . Sevelamer Hydrochloride show add benefit lower LDL level , lower highly sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) level , improve insulin resistance . Patients treat Sevelamer Hydrochloride also show improved vascular compliance reduce progression coronary vascular calcification . Since AGE 's mostly negatively charge compound , Sevelamer Carbonate analogy , may anti-AGE effect could reduce inflammation oxidative stress . Sevelamer Carbonate would major advantage Calcium Carbonate-based phosphate binder , base fact would add advantage reducing level AGEs . The resultant reduction OS inflammation would expect independent beneficial effect rate progression CKD CVD . We show CKD patient animal model AGE 's correlate level OS , LDL , hsCRP , insulin resistance . Additionally , factor remediate CKD non-CKD diabetic decrease overall AGE load , particularly diet . To date , effect Sevelamer Hydrochloride Sevelamer Carbonate OS circulate AGE level study . The anti-inflammatory lipid-lowering effect Sevelamer Hydrochloride may occur lower serum AGE level OS . Sevelamer Carbonate improve form Sevelamer Hydrochloride show safe effective alternative calcium carbonate treatment hyperphosphatemia earlier sta ` ge CKD without cause metabolic acidosis . The development Sevelamer Carbonate provide opportunity study patient earlier stage CKD , determine prevents slow progression CKD . We propose study design compare effect calcium carbonate Sevelamer Carbonate serum AGE level OS patient stage II-IV diabetic nephropathy . Hypothesis : Sevelamer Carbonate administration person stage II-IV CKD , compare calcium carbonate administration , result least : 1 . 20 % decrease serum level AGE 's ; 2 . 10 % decease inflammatory marker CRP VCAM-1 , OS ( AGER1/RAGE ) circulate mononuclear cell .</detailed_description>
