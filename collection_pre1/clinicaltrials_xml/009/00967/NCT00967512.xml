	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether treatment cenersen combination 4 cycle high low-dose chemotherapy ( idarubicin cytarabine ) improve complete response rate acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) patient ≥ 55 year age show response ( CR , CRi , PR ) single aggressive frontline induction course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aezea® ( Cenersen ) Chemotherapy AML Subjects ≥ 55 Years Age With No Response Frontline Induction Course</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cenersen phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide sequence 5'-CCCTG5-CTCCC10-CCCTG15-GCTCC20-3 ' . For AML , cenersen specific block p53 expression stem cell . When AML stem cell divide , cenersen sensitizes even low-level DNA damage type cause idarubicin , etoposide possibly ara-C. Because AML stem cell divide give time , protocol design treat patient total four cycle cenersen plus chemotherapy within two three month period . For limited period time , proliferate non-stem cell expect maintain even expand tumor stem cell deplete . If proliferate non-stem cell resupplied stem cell , become end stage blast division undergo elimination .</detailed_description>
