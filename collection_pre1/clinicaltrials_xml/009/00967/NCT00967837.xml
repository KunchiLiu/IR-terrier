	<brief_summary>One significant complication associate patient diabetes inability wound heal regardless enrol participate traditional wound heal program . There number anecdotal evidence present patient receive pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy complication non heal wound last several month several year whose wound heal receive therapy . This study design specifically monitor progress diabetic patient fail traditional wound care therapy monitor progress wound receive pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Pulsatile Intravenous ( IV ) Insulin Wound Healing Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes produce complication include inability wound heal despite participate traditional wound care therapy program . At time reduced tissue oxygen , circulation decrease , anecdotal evidence pulse IV insulin ( enable production energy glucose ) may permit heart , skeletal muscle , skin , organs function normally even repair damage heal . By track progress diabetic patient fail traditional wound care therapy monitor podiatrist health care professional objectively determine effect pulsatile IV therapy rate healing . Independent evaluation wound provide include visual examination , picture measurement weekly bi-weekly basis . Individuals breathe mask 3-5 minute rest period 30 minute . The ratio exhale volume CO2 inhale volume O2 determine RQ . The physiologic range 0.7 to1.3 . Individuals use fat primary fuel ratio 0.7 , protein mixed fuel 0.8-0.9 carbohydrate 0.9-1.0 . Those take excessive calorie RQ 's high 1.05 . The RQ follow serially do pulsatile IV insulin treatment , 3 successive session single treatment day . The amount intravenous insulin oral glucose give determine RQ change previous session . Pulsatile IV insulin therapy encourage glucose metabolism diabetic normalize multiple organ , especially muscle , retina , liver , kidney nerve ending . The process fundamentally require administration high dose insulin pulse similar find non diabetic human pancreas surround portal circulation . Oral carbohydrate give simultaneously augment process prevent hypoglycemia . The process monitor frequent glucose level respiratory quotient ( RQ ) . RQ measure metabolic cart determines ratio VCO2/ VO2 . This ratio specific fuel use one time body . The glucose level monitor keep glucose level appropriate RQ determines need readjust infusion protocol patient subsequent insulin infusion sessions.Patient evaluate post session discharge stable . Frequent monitoring RQ necessary level change rapidly , depend fuel utilize body . Pulsatile IV insulin therapy shift metabolism primarily fatty acid metabolism primarily glucose metabolism . This shift reflect increase respiratory quotient . However rest period RQ may fall back low level . Therefore RQ 's do begin end insulin infusion session 1 hour order appropriately monitor adjust insulin carbohydrate load reach optimal activation session</detailed_description>
