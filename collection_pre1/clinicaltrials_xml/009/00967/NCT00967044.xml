	<detailed_description>Phase I : The Study Drugs : Both panobinostat everolimus design block cancer cell multiply . Everolimus may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth . As result , cancer cell may grow slowly die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part phase study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 3-6 participant enrol phase study . If enrol phase study , dose study drug receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level study drug . Each new group may receive high dose study drug group , intolerable side effect see . This continue 5 combination study drug , high tolerable dose study drug combination find . Up 2 dose level everolimus 4 dose level panobinostat test phase study . This 5 different dose combination everolimus panobinostat . ( The dose drug get raise every dose level , sometimes 1 drug 's dose get raise . ) Study Drug Administration : Panobinostat : You take panobinostat mouth 3 time week cycle . Cycles study 28 day long . You take panobinostat 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water time day take . If miss dose panobinostat , take soon remember day . However , 12 hour pass since suppose take dose , skip day 's dose . In case , wait take panobinostat next schedule treatment day . Everolimus : You take everolimus every day , time morning . You take mouth 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You take everolimus either food drink except water ( `` fasting '' ) light , fat-free meal . Examples light , fat-free meal include cereal fat-free milk , fat-free muffin , toast , bagel fat-free spread , fruit salad . The reason avoid high-fat breakfast take everolimus help drug get absorb well body . If experience intolerable side effect , must call doctor right away . The doctor may lower dose study drug take study . You consume grapefruit product Seville ( sour ) orange study , may interact everolimus . Study Visits : Within 7 day first dose study drug : - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may occur . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn biomarker research . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . On Days 1 5 Cycle 1 , ECG . On Weeks 2 , 3 , 4 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Week 2 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn biomarker research . On Day 1 Cycle 2 every cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may occur . - Your performance status record . - You ECG ( 1 ECG doctor think need ) . - Blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . Every 8 week : - You PET scan check status disease . - You CT scan head neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Study : If show benefit take study drug , may receive 6 cycle . You take study intolerable side effect disease get bad . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop taking study drug , return clinic end-of-treatment visit : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 3 1/2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You PET scan check status disease . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan head neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . - If doctor think disease respond completely , bone marrow biopsy aspiration confirm complete response . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . This investigational study . Panobinostat FDA approve commercially available . At time drug use research . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment renal cell carcinoma . Using everolimus combination panobinostat patient lymphoma investigational . Up 18 patient take part phase study . All enrol MD Anderson . Phase II : The Study Drugs : Both panobinostat everolimus design block cancer cell multiply . Everolimus may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth . As result , cancer cell may grow slowly die . Study Drug Administration : Panobinostat : You take panobinostat mouth 3 time week cycle . Cycles study 28 day long .
