	<brief_title>N-Acetyl Cysteine Plus Behavioral Therapy Nicotine Dependent Pathological Gamblers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among US adult , 12.8 % report nicotine dependence , nicotine dependence highly associate variety DSM-IV Axis I II disorder ( Grant BF et al. , 2004 ) . Pathological gambling ( PG ) , serious public health problem detrimental effect individual family , estimate yearly cost society 5 billion dollar due lose job , debt , bankruptcy , incarceration , associate elevated proportion nicotine dependence ( 41 % - 55 % ) , tobacco smoke clinical sample pathological gambler associate increase gamble severity frequent psychiatric problem ( Smart &amp; Ferris , 1996 ; Crockfod &amp; El-Guebaly , 1998 ; Shaffer et al. , 1999 ; Petry &amp; Oncken , 2002 ; Potenza et al. , 2004 ; Grant et al. , 2005 ; Falk et al. , 2006 ; Fagan et al. , 2007 ) . In addition , research suggest continue nicotine use associate great rate relapse among pathological gambler receive behavioral therapy . Despite increased awareness relationship nicotine dependence PG , possible effect nicotine dependence gamble severity , previous research focus assessment treatment nicotine dependence may aid successful treatment PG smoking cessation . Preliminary research suggest behavioral therapy use imaginal desensitization motivational interviewing ( IDMI ) show promise reduce symptom PG ( Grant et al. , press ) . Despite efficacy treatment PG nicotine dependence , relapse common among individual nicotine dependence PG . Preclinical study suggest level glutamate within nucleus accumbens mediate reward-seeking behavior may underlie relapse see addiction . N-acetyl cysteine , dietary supplement , amino acid cysteine pro-drug , appear modulate glutamate within nucleus accumbens show benefit reduce reward-seeking behavior individual cocaine dependence pathological gambler ( Baker et al. , 2003 ; LaRowe et al. , 2006 ; Grant et al. , 2006 ) . If successful treat nicotine dependent pathological gambler , N-acetyl cysteine may serve viable , low-cost , easily available treatment option nicotine dependent pathological gambler receive behavioral therapy . We therefore propose examine dietary supplement , N-acetyl cysteine , use combination behavioral therapy , affect urge smoke gamble nicotine dependent pathological gambler smoke gamble behavior . We therefore propose randomize placebo-controlled trial N-acetyl cysteine placebo 80 nicotine dependent pathological gambler receive brief standardized smoking cessation treatment ( Ask , Advise , Refer model ) nicotine cessation 6 session IDMI PG . We hypothesize N-acetyl cysteine plus behavioral therapy result great reduction nicotine dependence PG symptom acute treatment phase enhance great long-term abstinence . Our research contribute improve understanding treatment nicotine-dependent pathological gambler well great understanding treatment co-occurring addiction . If intervention successful , potential set new standard care range psychiatric disorder co-occur nicotine dependence .</detailed_description>
