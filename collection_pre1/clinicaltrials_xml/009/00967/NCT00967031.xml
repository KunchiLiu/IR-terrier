	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib ditosylate together capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lapatinib ditosylate together capecitabine work treat patient stage IV breast cancer brain metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Capecitabine Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess objective response rate volumetric analysis brain metastasis assess MRI patient HER2-positive stage IV breast cancer treat lapatinib ditosylate capecitabine . Secondary - To document toxicity evaluate NCI CTC v3.0 . - To assess time radiotherapy . - To document time disease progression central nervous system ( CNS ) patient . - To evaluate overall response rate extra-CNS disease . - To assess clinical benefit ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ≥ 6 month ) CNS extra-CNS disease patient . Tertiary - To evaluate serum proteomics metabonomics marker predictor response . - To evaluate predictive value circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
