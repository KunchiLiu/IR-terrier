	<brief_summary>The optimal type oil prevent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) uncertain . In general , unsaturated oil higher content cis-monounsaturated fatty acid ( MONO ) cis-polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) preferable rich saturate fatty acid . However , unsaturated oil vary relative content n-6 n-3 fatty acid ( specifically alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) ) . Some investigator advocate oil rich ALA cardioprotective , others suggest optimal cardioprotective effect obtain oil low n-6 fatty acid ( mainly linoleic acid ) addition high ALA . It hypothesize increase ALA would result beneficial effect inflammatory marker . The objective trial establish definitively biological effect ALA without reduction linoleic acid inflammatory marker link CVD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study dietary trial examines effect increase ALA 2 gr 4 gr per day , without decrease linoleic acid , inflammatory marker link CVD . Trial participant ( n=136 ) , approximately 50 % woman , 50 % men ) age 50 old living town Montana , Bulgaria study . The study use double-blinded placebo-controlled , randomized cross-over design . Combinations two oil consider healthy ( sunflower olive ) ALA supplement contain either 2 4 gr ALA ( supply flaxseed oil ) placebo consume 6 week : sunflower-ALA ( high linoleic-low ALA ) , sunflower-placebo ( high linoleic-low ALA ) , olive-ALA ( low-linoleic-high ALA ) olive-placebo ( low linoleic-low ALA ) . The participant indicate keep usual diet physical activity through-out study . The primary endpoint plasma level inflammatory marker . Secondary endpoint include systolic diastolic blood pressure , plasma level LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol triglyceride . SPECIFIC AIMS To determine effect increase ALA 2 4 gr per day context diet high linoleic acid ( ~13 % energy ) inflammatory marker . The ALA effect test compare ALA supplement vs. placebo use sunflower oil cooking home . We hypothesize ALA favorable effect inflammatory marker context diet high linoleic acid . To determine effect increase ALA 2 4 gr per day context diet low linoleic acid ( ~6 % energy ) inflammatory marker . The ALA effect test compare ALA supplement vs. placebo use olive oil cooking home . We hypothesize ALA favorable effect inflammatory marker context diet low linoleic acid . SECONDARY AIMS To determine effect reduce linoleic acid high level ( ~13 % energy ) low level ( ~6 % energy ) keep ALA high level ( 2 4 gr per day ) plasma level inflammatory marker . The reduction linoleic acid test compare sunflower olive oil take ALA supplement . We hypothesize reduce linoleic acid affect inflammatory marker ALA intake high . To determine effect reduce linoleic acid high level ( ~13 % energy ) low level ( ~6 % energy ) keep ALA low level ( placebo ) plasma level inflammatory marker . The reduction linoleic acid test compare sunflower olive oil take placebo . We hypothesize reduce linoleic acid affect inflammatory marker ALA intake low . To determine whether intervention contrast specify specific aim secondary aim 1 &amp; 2 affect plasma level LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol triglycerides blood pressure . We hypothesize ALA favorable effect plasma triglyceride blood pressure compare placebo regardless whether linoleic acid high low . We hypothesize lower linoleic acid favorable effect plasma HDL cholesterol unfavorable effect LDL cholesterol , regardless whether ALA high low .</detailed_description>
