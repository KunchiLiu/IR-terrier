	<brief_summary>Rehabilitative treatment stroke survivor show effective improve functional outcome reduce dependency . Plasticity central nervous system , along cop strategy adaptation , seem play key role functional recovery . Some data support hypothesis drug improve dopaminergic , serotoninergic noradrenergic transmission central nervous system could improve recovery stroke patient . In population , antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) associate well outcome , evidence small clinical trial . However , since depression common consequence stroke , observed improvement could bias action drug depressive symptom , thus improve participation rehabilitative treatment . The hypothesis study SSRI could improve functional outcome stroke survivor action depressive symptom , mainly direct effect neural repair neuronal growth . The aim study evaluate effect SSRI , escitalopram , functional outcome stroke patient .</brief_summary>
