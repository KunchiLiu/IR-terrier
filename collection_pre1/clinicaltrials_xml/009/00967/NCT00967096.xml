	<brief_summary>Acute graft versus host disease frequent often life threaten complication allogeneic blood marrow transplantation . The bacteria normally reside intestine play critical role development . Injury line bowel result high dose chemotherapy radiation transplant patient receive week precede transplant allows bacteria invade intestine spread nearby lymph node . This , turn , cause inflammation show promote GVHD . Both pre-clinical clinical research demonstrate oral antibiotic prevent graft versus host disease inhibit gut bacteria . Rifaximin several feature suggest could effective prevent GVHD . Rifaximin prophylaxis might also provide add benefit protect highly immunocompromised transplant patient severe bacterial infection . This pilot trial allow investigator determine feasibility use Rifaximin prevention GVHD infection patient undergo allogeneic blood marrow transplantation . The preliminary result use plan definitive trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must least 12 year old . 2 . Patients eligible regardless type disease ( malignant nonmalignant ) , type donor ( HLA match related , mismatch relate unrelated donor ) , type hematopoietic cell source ( unstimulated marrow , cytokine stimulate marrow , cytokine stimulate peripheral blood umbilical cord blood ) , GVHD prophylaxis . 3 . Patients must receive myeloablative moderately intensive reduce intensity ( least 8 mg/kg oral busulfan ( equivalent IV dose ) , least 100 mg/m2 Melphalan , least 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide , least 500 cGy TBI ) condition regimen . 1 . Age 12 year . 2 . Known hypersensitivity rifaximin , rifamycin antimicrobial agent . 3 . Minimally toxic condition regimen ( e.g . low dose TBI base ) . Since regimen induce minimal myelosuppression gut injury , patient receive probably stand little gain antibiotic prophylaxis . 4 . Patients document severe active infection ( viral , bacterial , fungal , protozoal ) eligible . 5 . Patients treatment unresponsive hematologic malignant disease ( base assessment do within two week start condition therapy ) .</criteria>
