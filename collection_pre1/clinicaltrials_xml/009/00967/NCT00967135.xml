	<brief_summary>This study design ass : 1 . The impact take perioperative pregabalin incidence chronic neuropathic pain postthoracotomy syndrome 3 month patient undergone thoracotomy thoracic epidural basic analgesic modality . 2 . The impact take perioperative pregabalin relief acute pain , use additional analgesic , opioids , relief pain patient undergone thoracic surgery thoracic epidural basic analgesia . 3 . The impact take perioperative pregabalin quality life level function patient underwent thoracic surgery 3 month earlier . 4 . The safety profile pregabalin patient population . Hypothesis : The basic hypothesis study dose pregabalin administer preemptively 1 hour thoracotomy , repeatedly postoperative period , neuronal hyperexcitability maximum ( i.e. , 4 day ) , lead 33.3 % decrease prevalence chronic pain 3 month surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Perioperative Pregabalin Reducing Incidence Chronic Neuropathic Pain Postthoracotomy Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postthoracotomy pain syndrome rather frequent phenomenon . Its incidence , report literature , varies around 52 % 1 2 year surgery . This syndrome define persistent and/or recurrent pain burn sensation along thoracotomy scar least 2 month surgery . The pain significant , give 3 5 % patient report severe , approximately 50 % patient report limitation activity daily live secondary pain consider pain worst medical problem . A neuropathic component make certain contribution pain . Patients neuropathic component report more-severe pain take analgesic . Little known origin pain , seem intensity acute postoperative pain best predictor . Pregabalin could possible approach reduce prevalence chronic postthoracotomy pain . Its efficacy demonstrate several diabetic , postherpetic , incisional inflammatory neuropathic pain model . Methods : One hundred twenty patient divide two equal group ( receive pregabalin placebo ) . Prior induction general anesthesia , thoracic epidural place start immediately prior surgery . The anesthetic technique monitoring standardized . During immediate postoperative period , intensity pain assess use VNPS ( 0-10 ) . Pain assess upon patient 's arrival discharge recovery room daily thereafter , total duration four postoperative day discharge hospital occurs 4th postoperative day . Three month surgery , patient contact telephone administer standardized questionnaire evaluating : - The presence intensity ( base VNPS ) pain surgical and/or drainage tube site . - The type pain , specific attention identify presence neuropathic pain . - The patient ' assessment quality life , impact , , pain level functioning daily live relation preoperative quality life functioning .</detailed_description>
