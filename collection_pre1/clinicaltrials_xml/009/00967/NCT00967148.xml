	<brief_title>Thromboprophylaxis Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient high risk postoperative thrombosis risk remain elevated beyond period hospitalization . Thromboprophylaxis effectively reduce risk post operative VTE cancer patient . Extended thromboprophylaxis beyond hospitalization ( 30 day ) LMWH show reduce risk postoperative VTE . Concurrently , grow body evidence suggest LMWH may anti-cancer effect due anti-metastatic property may improve survival cancer patient , even absence document VTE . Retrospective study show perioperative thromboprophylaxis ( i.e. , start thromboprophylaxis surgery ) seem increase survival cancer patient undergo abdominal pelvic cancer surgery curative intent . The investigator propose perform open-label RCT determine thromboprophylaxis use tinzaparin 4,500 IU daily , start time decision operate peri-operative period extend 4 week postoperatively , feasible .</detailed_description>
