	<brief_summary>Acute systemic hyperglycemia cause oxidative stress pro-inflammatory response . The pro-inflammatory cytokine induce hyperglycemia toxic islet insulin produce cell , thus worsen glucose intolerance . Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) high prevalence CF relate diabetes ( CFRD ) 40 % CF adult develop CFRD . During prediabetic phase CF , progression normal glucose homeostasis high risk prediabetes characterize episode acute hyperglycemia meal respiratory exacerbation . The mild hyperglycemia see CF patient high risk prediabetes follow meal would expect induce degree systemic inflammation oxidative stress . These repetitive episode , leave unchecked , could lead progression glucose impairment , worsen severity oxidative stress inflammation , ultimately development CFRD , via hyperglycemia-induced toxicity beta cell . Furthermore , process may accelerate CF lung disease resultant respiratory exacerbation associate oxidative stress inflammation contribute beta cell damage . Sitagliptin recently approve agent type 2 diabetes markedly enhance insulin secretion presence hyperglycemia show effective prevent postprandial hyperglycemia . The hypothesis test project sitagliptin prevent development CFRD CF subject high risk prediabetes block postprandial hyperglycemia . The investigator propose randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , 15-month longitudinal study 118 CF subject high risk prediabetes test hypothesis . Specifically , investigator aim show chronic treatment sitagliptin : prevents conversion diabetes ; result preservation beta cell function ; reduces systemic measure oxidative stress inflammation ; slow rate progression lung disease .

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study 118 CF subject age 13 year age old high risk prediabetes . High risk prediabetes define screen visit perform oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) find fast plasma glucose level 110-125 mg/dl and/or 2-hour plasma glucose level 140 199 mg/dl . Upon enrollment , subject randomize receive either sitagliptin placebo . Each subject follow 15 month determine sitagliptin prevents conversion frank diabetes . The follow do enrollment every 6 month : OGTT collection blood 0 , 1/2 , 2 hour measurement glucose insulin order determine progression glucose intolerance ; collection blood time 0 2 hour OGTT measurement systemic redox status , oxidative stress , degree inflammation determine degree basal oxidative stress inflammation well degree hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress inflammation ; collection exhale breath condensate subset subject select site time 0 2 hour OGTT measurement airway redox status , degree inflammation , glucose level determine basal respiratory tract redox status inflammation , degree hyperglycemia-induced change redox status inflammation , correlation plasma airway glucose level ; collection blood determine safety study medication ( liver renal function , complete blood count , electrolyte concentration ) ; determination progression lung disease define number respiratory exacerbation severe enough require hospitalization rate decline lung function . The result two OGTTs perform least one week apart use determine whether subject convert high risk prediabetes frank diabetes ( primary objective ) . Conversion CFRD define OGTTs abnormal ( abnormal define fast plasma glucose level great 125 mg/dl and/or 2 hour glucose level great 199 mg/dl ) . The result measure redox balance , oxidant stress inflammation ( secondary objective ) provide biologic plausibility concept mechanism action sitagliptin prevent development CF diabetes . Hemoglobin-specific A1c fraction ( HbA1c ) measure half-way 6-monthly visit rise 0.5 % enrollment value result two OGTT test do least one week apart determine diabetes develop . At interval study visit , blood also collect assess safety study drug , subject female , determine pregnancy occur . In event diabetes develop , study drug ( placebo ) stop subject complete study . In summary , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial determine whether sitagliptin prevents conversion CF subject high-risk prediabetes frank diabetes . If successful , would first treatment modality available prevent development CFRD , serious life shorten complication CF .</detailed_description>
