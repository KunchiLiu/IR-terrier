	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue , blood , urine patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor find good way treat cancer . PURPOSE : This research study look tissue , blood , urine sample patient advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tissue , Blood , Urine Samples From Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To study molecular pathology mechanism disease progression . - To develop novel treatment strategy patient advanced prostate cancer . - To evaluate novel marker treatment epidemiological approach . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Program I ( Molecular Signaling Advanced Prostate Cancer ) : Researchers Newcastle , York , Bristol analyze androgen receptor ( AR ) ( i.e. , AR regulate gene AR co-activators co-repressors ) fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signal examine cross-talk two system insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) axis . - Program II ( Mechanisms Skeletal Metastases ) : Researchers Newcastle , Sheffield , Bristol , Manchester analyze mechanisms skeletal metastasis candidate factor responsible skeletal metastasis ( e.g. , BMP-6 , TGF-Î²1 , IL-6 , IL-6 receptor ) . The balance proteases inhibitor also analyze . - Program III ( Prostate Targeting , Models , Novel Approaches Therapy ) : Researchers Newcastle , Sheffield , York , Manchester analyze develop reagent method facilitate novel gene-based approach therapy , include prostate tissue specific gene expression , model system gene function therapeutic study , translational gene-based therapy , effector potential gene therapy . - Program IV ( Developmental Therapeutics ) : Researchers Newcastle , York , Manchester analyze novel protein identify study synthesize novel reagent aim disrupt pathway signal molecule show critical importance prostate cancer ( e.g. , AR FGF signal ) . - Program V ( Biorepository Database ) : Tissue , DNA , blood , serum , urine sample Newcastle , Sheffield , Manchester biorepositories store used analysis program I-IV . Support tissue data collection well database management provide enable resource make available wider research community . - Program VI ( Clinical Trials Health Services Research ) : Researchers Newcastle , Sheffield , Manchester , Bristol participate phase I trials use dendritic cell gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy ( GDEPT ) approach analyze environmental interaction genotype evaluate prevention strategy ( e.g. , diet ) may underlie variation incidence prostate cancer .
