	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study look blood tissue sample patient prostate cancer receive androgen deprivation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Blood Tissue Samples From Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify molecular pathophysiological change occur early stage androgen deprivation ( AD ) emerge castration-resistant prostate cancer . - To test functional image non-invasive tool measure treatment response validate use biological endpoint . - To develop clinical model predict tumor respond AD identify new target AD fails . OUTLINE : - Group A : Patients likely receive androgen deprivation ( AD ) first-line therapy undergo blood prostate biopsy sample collection treatment day 0 14 90 . Patients receive androgen receptor inhibitor follow maintenance gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue begin day 0 . Patients also undergo diffusion-weighted MRI , MR spectroscopic imagining , quantitative T1W mapping , T1W perfusion sequence . - Group B : Patients already receive AD undergo blood prostate biopsy sample collection within 4 week diagnosis castration-resistant prostate cancer initiate second-line therapy . Blood tissue sample assess via DNA RNA genetic analysis , gene expression study , comparative genomic hybridization identify novel marker androgen response resistance .
