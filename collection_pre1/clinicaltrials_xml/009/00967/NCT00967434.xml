	<brief_summary>Patients undergo non-cardiac surgery frequently experience perioperative cardiac complication may due excess inflammatory reaction . Lipid lower drug call HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor statin , anti-inflammatory effect . Although favourable evidence suggest drug could also prevent perioperative cardiac complication , definitive evidence anti-inflammatory effect benefit lack . The purpose study measure impact atorvastatin patient undergoing surgery . It attempt determine speed drug effect measure impact drug level inflammatory mediator call C-reactive protein surgery . It hypothesize perioperative use atorvastatin safely reduce postoperative rise CRP level 48 hour elective vascular surgery . This effect , would translate reduction adverse perioperative complication include reduction postoperative myocardial ischemia episode ( measure Holter monitoring ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite modern improvement operative care , non-cardiac surgery still associate significant costly cardiac complication . The incidence major perioperative cardiac event varies , range 1 % unselected population 15 % vascular surgical patient . An estimated 2 million North Americans yearly experience perioperative cardiac event associate mortality 30-50 % financial burden 20 billion dollar . Best evidence suggest medical optimization prefer strategy reduce risk . There exist favorable physiologic evidence promise clinical observation statin drug may prevent perioperative complication . We propose randomize controlled trial evaluate short-term atorvastatin versus placebo inflammatory change myocardial ischemia patient undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery . The traditional belief etiology perioperative myocardial event supply-demand discrepancy due hypotension hypoxia compromise cardiac oxygen delivery thus result myocardial ischemia infarction dispute . Therapies target supply-demand imbalance , include perioperative beta-blockers , disappoint . Emerging evidence suggest perioperative cardiac event similar non-operative event rupture coronary plaque thrombosis central development acute coronary event . Key element plaque rupture inflammation endothelial dysfunction . Elevated inflammatory marker , particularly C-reactive protein associate adverse cardiac event . Drugs known statin offer benefit beyond traditional improvement lipid level . Statins so-called pleiotropic effect include anti-inflammatory , endothelial function change plaque stabilization . Atorvastatin , statin good safety profile , particularly effective improve inflammatory level decrease cardiac event include death . Perioperatively , elevate C-reactive protein level surgery associate perioperative complication include cardiac event . Thus , strategy control perioperative inflammation may reduce complication . Retrospective study small prospective study suggest statin would reduce perioperative complication definitive evidence lack . Questions regard dose time dose unclear . Likewise , little proven potential pathophysiology atorvastatin reduce perioperative myocardial event . Our hypothesis atorvastatin use reduce postoperative rise CRP level 48 hour . Eligible non-cardiac surgical patient randomize 3 group 3 stage treatment ; namely stage 1 ( preoperative period 7 day ) , stage 2 ( immediate preoperative ) , stage 3 ( first 7 postoperative day ) . Group A receive atorvastatin 3 stage . Group B receive placebo stage 1 atorvastatin stage 2 3 . Group C receive placebo 3 stage . Atorvastatin dose case 80 mg. C-reactive protein lipid level ass statin effect . Safety assess liver enzymes CK level . Myocardial event assess troponin T , ECG Holter monitoring . Follow-up 6 month do .</detailed_description>
