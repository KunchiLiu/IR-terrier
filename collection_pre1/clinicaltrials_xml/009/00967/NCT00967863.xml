	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know dose radiation therapy effective treating patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare two radiation therapy regimens treat patient prostate cancer receive hormone therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess impact increase radiation dose 10 Gy biochemical clinical progression-free survival 5 year patient unfavorable-risk prostate cancer receive prolong hormone therapy . Secondary - Evaluate overall specific survival . - Assess acute late toxicity different modality ( conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy ) . - Evaluate toxicity different dos respect hormonal therapy . - Assess quality life ( QLQ-C30 PR 25 ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo 80 Gy conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 time week 7-8 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo 70 Gy conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 time week 7-8 week . In arm , patient receive goserelin subcutaneously every 3 month 3 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
