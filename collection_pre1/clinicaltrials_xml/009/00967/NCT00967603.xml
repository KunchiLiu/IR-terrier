	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block tyrosine kinase need angiogenesis cell growth . It yet know whether sunitinib malate effective maintenance therapy delay tumor progression patient metastatic pancreatic cancer progression-free 6 month induction chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study sunitinib malate maintenance therapy see well work compare observation avoid tumor progression induction chemotherapy patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintenance Therapy With Sunitinib Observation Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare 6-month progression-free survival patient metastatic pancreatic cancer without progression 6 month induction chemotherapy treat sunitinib malate maintenance therapy v observation . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : - Arm I : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo observation .</detailed_description>
