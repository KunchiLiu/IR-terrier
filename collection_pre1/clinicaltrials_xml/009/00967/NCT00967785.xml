	<brief_summary>Background : - WHIMS ( wart , hypogammaglobulinemia , infection , myelokathexis syndrome ) cause various genetic change increase activity CXCR4 gene . Excessive function gene cause mature neutrophil ( part white blood cell ) retain within bone marrow rather release general blood circulation , one cause severe inherit neutropenia ( low white blood count ) . In neutropenia , body less able fight infection . Patients WHIMS usually risk skin , soft tissue , sinus , lung infection , result loss hearing , teeth , lung function . - Current treatment WHIMS consist regular injection white blood cell growth stimulate medication call granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) , monthly infusion intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . These therapy expensive , nonspecific , significant side effect toxicity , fully correct problem , especially warts cancer related human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . - A drug call Mozobil approve use combination G-CSF increase number stem cell collect prior bone marrow transplantation . Mozobil may offer specific well-tolerated new treatment WHIMS syndromes characterize neutropenia . Objectives : - To evaluate whether Mozobil safe effective treat neutropenia ( low white blood cell count ) patient WHIMS . - To determine appropriate treatment dose Mozobil , within currently approve dosage level . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age diagnose WHIMS history severe infection . Design : - Potential participant undergo screen study , medical history , physical examination , questionnaire , heart lung function scan , blood urine sample . Tests also do hepatitis B C virus , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , well check neutrophil function . - Patients treat G-CSF stop injection 5 day admit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center . While medication , patient keep diary report information general well-being medication bring NIH admit . - Patients admit NIH Clinical Center inpatient 2 day start treatment stay approximately 10 day . Before treatment , patient blood sample take regularly . - Patients receive increase dos Mozobil 5 day treatment white blood cell count improve sufficiently maximum approve dose reach . Blood sample take regularly throughout treatment process . Patients receive additional dose Mozobil maximum approve dose dose sufficient cause improvement , restart G-CSF injection . - Between 4 6 week treatment phase , patient return NIH outpatient study completion evaluation visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mozobil ( TM ) ( plerixafor injection , Genzyme Corp. ) Food Drug Administration approve medication mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell prior apheresis use autologous transplantation non-Hodgkin lymphoma multiple myeloma use conjunction granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . The drug mechanism action specific reversible inhibition chemokine receptor , CXCR4 , express CD34+ cell leukocytes . This inhibition interfere bind stromal cell derive factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) , constitutively express bone marrow stromal cell appear cause direct indirect cellular adhesive interaction . Severe congenital neutropenia rare inherit disorder affect individual develop chronic cyclical neutropenia circulate count 500 cells/microliter blood . This disorder may result variety genetic defect progenitor- neutrophil-expressed gene elastase , CXCR4 , G6PC3 , etc . Myelokathexis abnormal retention mature leukocytes bone marrow see type severe chronic neutropenia wart , hypogammaglobulinemia , infection , myelokathexis syndrome ( WHIMS ) . WHIMS rare primary immunodeficiency , know cause mutation enhance CXCR4 signal . Our hypothesis Mozobil ( TM ) use safely partially block CXCR4 treat neutropenia result myelokathexis dos considerably low use CD34+ cell mobilization . This new treatment could also improve aspect disease frequent infection , wart , hypogammaglobulinemia . To test hypothesis , propose trial Mozobil ( TM ) adult WHIMS , examine safety absolute neutrophil count primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
