	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death long term disability , particularly young adult . Studies Australia show approximately half severe traumatic brain injury severely disable dead 6 month post injury . Given young age many patient severe TBI long term prevalence major disability , economic importantly social cost community high . Pre-hospital hospital management patient severe brain injury focus prevention additional injury due primarily lack oxygen insufficient blood pressure . This include optimise sedation ventilation , maintain fluid balance drain Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) perform surgery appropriate . In recent year research focus specific pharmacologic intervention , however , date , treatment associate improvement neurological outcome . One treatment show promise application hypothermia ( cool ) . This treatment commonly use Australia decrease brain injury patient brain injury follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . Cooling thought protect brain use number mechanism . There number animal study look cool protective also clinical research suggest benefit . However current time insufficient evidence provide enough proof cooling use routinely patient brain injury like treatment risk side effect . The POLAR trial develop investigate whether early cooling patient severe traumatic brain injury associate well outcomes . It randomise control trial , type trial provide high quality evidence . The null hypothesis difference proportion favourable neurological outcome six month severe traumatic brain injury patient treat early sustain hypothermia , compare standard normothermic management .</brief_summary>
