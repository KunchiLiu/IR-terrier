	<brief_summary>Early change neurobehavior strongly associate intelligence development child . Previous study report cesarean section could influence later development child . In addition , neuraxial anesthesia include epidural , spinal combine spinal epidural anesthesia ( CSEA ) major form use cesarean delivery , anesthesia technique undoubtedly evoke hypotension correspond hemodynamic alteration , would result decrease umbilical placental insufficiency fetus hypoxia lead early abnormality neurobehaviors infant . Fluid management , crystalloid colloid , common one give / neuraxial anesthesia prevent reverse hypotension . However , still unknown whether perineuraxial anesthesia fluid resuscitation could improve neurobehavior scoring , could produce positive effect later intelligence development . Herein investigator hypothesize effective perineuraxial anesthesia fluid management cesarean section would prevent occurrence hypotension improve infant 's neurobehavior scoring .</brief_summary>
