	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study ( 1 ) determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) L-377202 administer every 3 week , ( 2 ) evaluate safety tolerability L-377202 include dose-limiting adverse effect treatment L-377202 , ( 3 ) ass pharmacokinetics various dos L-377202 plasma profile liberate doxorubicin leu-doxorubicin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Safety Tolerability L-377202</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , nonrandomized , rising-dose study patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . Patients treat L-377202 every three week . Plasma concentration L-377202 , liberate doxorubicin , leu-doxorubicin obtain defined time interval throughout study . At least 1 patient treat dose level evidence great equal Grade 2 drug-related toxicity . Each patient treat 1 dose level , although multiple cycle may administer sign disease progression unacceptable toxicity evident . Doses doubled subsequent cohort patient evidence great equal Grade 2 drug-related toxicity . Upon documentation great equal Grade 2 drug-related toxicity , subsequent dose escalation proceed along modify Fibonacci scale enroll least 3 patient per dose level 1 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) .</detailed_description>
