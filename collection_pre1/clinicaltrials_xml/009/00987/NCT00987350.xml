	<brief_title>Safety Study Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Jet Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The device call LectraJet M3 recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , government agency oversees approval new medical device . The approval call 510 ( k ) allow marketing use device United States ( US ) . Devices 510 ( k ) need clinical trial perform . The researcher perform study order collect clinical data control environment . Non significant risk ( NSR ) device LectraJet may study clinical trial without 510 ( k ) . Currently several disposable-syringe jet injector also FDA approve sale use United States , include : 1 ) Biojector® 2000 , 2 ) Medi-Jector Vision , 3 ) Injex™ . These device use deliver million injection variety healthcare setting . The LectraJet® jet injector suit mass immunization campaign due ability power device foot pedal well electricity speed immunization deliver . It design vaccine delivery characteristic license disposable-syringe jet injector . Giving vaccine without needle ( needle-free vaccine delivery ) may better give use needle many reason . One method give shot without needle technique call jet injection . This researcher test study . A jet injector push vaccine fluid small hole high enough speed allow vaccine go subject 's skin without need needle . Years ago , people get shot use jet injector , old device reuse `` nozzle '' hole fluid force . Newer jet injector , include one researcher test study , use disposable cartridge hold vaccine . So , thing touch subject 's skin cartridge , get thrown away injection . In study , volunteer get license seasonal flu vaccine see jet injector work well give vaccine needle syringe . The seasonal flu vaccine researcher use call trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) . It license US protect people 6 month age old influenza . Influenza virus also commonly know `` flu '' . The flu serious illness kill 35,000 people per year US alone . The flu virus constantly change people risk develop complication flu , child , elderly , people underlie health condition need vaccinate every year . Volunteers receive 2009-2010 annual seasonal flu vaccine call TIV either needle syringe jet injection . The researcher compare side effect see well vaccine generates immune response give two method .</detailed_description>

Volunteers may take daily oral , nasal , inhaled , parenteral steroid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication . Medications mention require approval PI , sponsor , medical monitor . Any use antibiotic 7 day enrollment . Vital sign abnormal think investigator increase risk volunteer . Mild elevation depression blood pressure heart rate may allow . Current alcohol illicit drug dependence . History receipt influenza vaccine 20082009 and/or 20092010 season History GuillainBarré Syndrome Failure pas write exam ; pass score 70 % great . Receipt experimental agent ( e.g. , vaccine medication ) within 30 day prior enrollment expectation receipt experimental agent participate study . Receipt live , attenuated vaccine within 30 day prior enrollment . Receipt subunit kill vaccine within 14 day prior enrollment . Receipt blood product , include immunoglobulin , 90 day prior enrollment . Oral temperature &gt; 37.7 degree C acute illness occur prior inoculation day vaccination . ( This lead postponement enrollment , exclusion trial . Mild resolve illness may allow discretion investigator ) Anything , opinion investigator , compromise participation volunteer respect his/her right risk .</criteria>
