	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Traumatic Brain Injury ( EPO-TBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many people traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) - usually blow head vehicle collision fall survive , , suffer long-term disability . Previous study show 1,000 people Australia New Zealand suffer moderate severe TBI every year . With current best available treatment therapy many patient sustain loss brain function long term disability vary degree . When patient sustain traumatic brain injury two phase injury . First , head-impact cause immediate damage brain . The secondary injury , evolve hour week , complicate process . It involve many , link , change cell , brain chemistry , tissue blood vessel destroy brain tissue . The treatment brain injury focus try minimize secondary injury much research do try find treatment prevent . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) recently emerge drug may help reduce secondary injury improve brain function . It find offer protection brain brain cell deprive normal oxygen supply cause cell die impair . The aim study determine EPO reduce secondary brain injury help patient make good recovery traumatic brain injury . The investigator also plan monitor effect EPO rate deep vein thrombosis ( DVT - blood clot large vein low extremity ) patient moderate severe TBI intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Study Hypothesis : In patient moderate ( GCS 9-12 ) severe ( 3-8 ) TBI , EPO therapy improve long-term neurological function assess 6 month injury .</detailed_description>
