	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy Selective Retina Therapy ( SRT ) treat acute idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy ( ICSC ) . Patients acute symptomatic ICSC least 3 month duration recruit . The patient randomize equal term SRT- ( Treatment ) control group . After 3 month follow patient control group persistence disease activity allocate crossover group receive either SRT . Crossover group follow 3 month . The primary outcome measure study serial change Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letterscore edema optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) 3 month . Secondary outcome measure include proportion eye complete absorption subretinal fluid , leakage fluorescein angiography systemic ocular complication study 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selective Retina Therapy ( SRT ) Patients With Idiopathic Central Serous Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy ( ICSC ) characterize serous detachment neurosensory retina macular region secondary focal retinal pigment epithelial defect . Patients ICSC , oftentimes young male adult , experience visual disturbance include micropsia , metamorphopsia , central scotoma , reduce visual acuity loss contrast sensitivity . Most case ICSC presume self-limiting usually resolve spontaneously within 3 4 months.Nevertheless duration disease strongly relate vision prognosis reattachment within 4 month onset consider relevant therapeutic target prolong detachment associate photoreceptor atrophy . The therapeutic effect focal cw laser photocoagulation fully establish . One obvious theory postulate beneficial effect photocoagulation associate establishment new barrier RPE cell subsequently reintegrate RPE pump function integrity RPE barrier . Based theory , destruction tissue surround RPE , particular Bruch ` membrane , choroid photoreceptors , would unwanted side effect . On basis consideration Selective Retina Therapy ( SRT ) , innovative laser technology selectively damage RPE spar neurosensory retina , suggest ideal treatment ICSC focal leakage , especially RPE leak locate close fovea . It prove safe , microperimetry show SRT cause microscotoma . SRT already adopt treatment diverse macular disease inter alia patient ICSC promise performance .</detailed_description>
