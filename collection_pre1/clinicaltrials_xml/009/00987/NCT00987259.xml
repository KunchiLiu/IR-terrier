	<brief_summary>Despite recent improvement treatment , myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) still lead cause illness death UK . Following acute event , difficult predict patient risk problem , heart failure therefore difficult know patient need aggressive/intensive treatment monitoring . There need test safe , reliable reproducible use shortly heart attack predict future cardiac event allow efficacy new treatment assess . Myocardial oedema ( swell heart muscle ) demonstrate use Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) , occur follow heart attack suggest marker future cardiac event . The optimum time perform scan , method data analysis 's effectiveness predictor future cardiac event adequately assess . This trial ass amount natural time-course oedema first 10 day follow heart attack . It also correlate amount oedema size scar ( damage heart muscle ) leave ventricular ejection fraction ( heart function ) 3 month assess predictive marker .</brief_summary>
