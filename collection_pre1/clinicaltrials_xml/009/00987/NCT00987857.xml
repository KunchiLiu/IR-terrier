	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Screening test may help doctor find cancer cell early plan well treatment . It yet know whether endoscopy every 2 year effective endoscopy need find esophageal cancer patient Barrett esophagus . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study endoscopy every 2 year see well work compare endoscopy need monitoring patient Barrett esophagus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopy Every 2 Years Only Needed Monitoring Patients With Barrett Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish whether endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need superior term overall survival , neither superior , whether endoscopy need non-inferior surveillance every 2 year patient Barrett esophagus . Secondary - To estimate cost-effectiveness endoscopic surveillance every 2 year compare endoscopy need . - To establish whether significant difference endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need term incidence esophageal cancer , gastric esophageal cancer , cancer . - To establish whether significant difference endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need term time diagnosis esophageal adenocarcinoma . - To establish whether significant difference endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need term stage esophageal adenocarcinoma diagnosis use TNM staging . - To establish whether significant difference endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need term morbidity mortality relate endoscopy , esophageal surgery , endoscopy-related intervention ( e.g. , ablation ) . - To establish whether significant difference endoscopic surveillance every 2 year endoscopy need term frequency endoscopy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age diagnosis ( &lt; 65 year vs ≥ 65 year ) , length Barrett metaplasia segment include tongue ( &lt; 2 cm v ≥ 2 cm ≤ 3 cm v &gt; 3 cm ≤ 8 cm v &gt; 8 cm ) , newly diagnose disease ( defined date endoscopy confirm Barrett metaplasia within past 4 month ) ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo surveillance endoscopy quadrantic biopsy take every 2 cm . Patients undergo endoscopy every 2 year total 6 endoscopy 10 year . - Arm II : Patients undergo endoscopy need 10 year . All patient may undergo urgent endoscopy develop dysphagia , unexplained weight loss &gt; 7 lb , iron-deficiency anemia , recurrent vomiting , worsen upper gastrointestinal symptom . All patient complete questionnaire include quality-of-life measure question medication baseline , every 2 year , follow key event ( e.g. , diagnosis cancer high-grade dysplasia ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically confirm circumferential Barrett metaplasia meet 1 follow criterion : At least 1 cm gastroesophageal junction At least 2 cm noncircumferential tongue Barrett metaplasia Undergone endoscopy within last 2 year confirm Barrett metaplasia exclude highgrade dysplasia carcinoma No known highgrade dysplasia carcinoma PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Resident United Kingdom Informed risk Barrett esophagus develop esophageal cancer , either visit invitation letter issue document previous occasion Able undergo endoscopy No medical condition would make endoscopy difficult hazardous PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
