	<detailed_description>Obesity one great public health challenge 21st century . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 2005 indicate approximately 1.6 billion adult overweight ( body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 25 kg/m2 ) , 400 million characterize obese ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) . By 2015 , WHO projections predict population overweight obese adult increase 2.3 billion 700 million respectively . The major determinant obesity energy imbalance calorie intake expenditure , ascribe global dietary shift favor energy-dense food particularly rich fat carbohydrate , global trend towards sedentary behavior . Body fat distribution abdominal fat particular correlate increase risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , cancer , total mortality . It therefore important develop minimally invasive clinical tool assess visceral fat . Computed Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) represent gold standard quantification visceral abdominal fat . However , analytical cost limited availability instrument large-scale screening encourage development alternative method base cost effective widely distribute technology . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) promise technology fill gap . DXA use increasingly rapid , precise , accurate method measurement regional total body composition clinical research setting . Total body assessment use DXA provide unique capability non-invasive measurement skeletal bone status , well lean fat tissue component include percent fat , lean tissue mass , android ( waist ) /gynoid ( hip ) fat ratio . The DXA technology well suit large-scale screen assess body composition fat distribution part global assessment metabolic status . A recent study cross-sectional sample 5440 US adult participate NHANES survey 1999-2004 show 29.2 % obese men 35.4 % obese woman ( total approximately 19.5 million US adult ) metabolically healthy , ( sometimes refer `` uncomplicated '' obesity ) , whereas 30.1 % normal-weight men 21.1 % normal-weight woman ( total approximately 16.3 million US adult ) exhibit cluster two cardiometabolic abnormality . This study conclude additional research require understand physiological mechanism underlie difference . Another recent study 3000 participant draw Framingham Heart Study show subcutaneous fat visceral fat correlate metabolic risk factor . However , effect visceral fat remain significant adjusting common anthropometric index waist circumference BMI . The issue surround cardiometabolic risk among different phenotype along increased risk associate visceral fat suggest need measure visceral adipose tissue diverse population.The gold standard , CT , practical solution due cost radiation exposure associate measurement . Therefore , important develop low-cost , low-radiation screening method measure visceral adipose tissue . The present study aim measure abdominal fat distribution ( CT scan Lunar iDXA ) 120 adult . These data provide possibility validate new method measure abdominal fat distribution ( visceral versus subcutaneous fat ) gold standard , CT . If validate , protocol base Lunar iDXA could offer rapid cost effective diagnostic tool fat distribution assessment individual basis future personalize health care program .</detailed_description>
