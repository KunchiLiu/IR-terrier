	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : A reason repeat disappointing outcomes clinical trial test target immune biologics lupus may heterogeneity disease , exacerbate variable effect immune homeostasis background medication must continue , study design , flare-prone patient . Purpose Study : This study design purposefully study population equivalent placebo group typical trial SLE . In Group A patient entered trial mild-moderate flare , treat depomedrol , background immune suppressant withdrawn . Biomarkers entry various medication compare biomarkers steroid efficacy background immune suppressant withdrawn . Depomedrol usually wear one three month . Patients closely observed , serial biomarkers draw monthly interval immediately time new flare . Those patient develop new flare donate blood sample , immediately treat deemed appropriate , exit study . Group A design 50 patient recruit total 41 . An additional group 62 SLE patient donate blood without additional intervention order increase power exploratory cross-sectional biomarker analysis different immune suppressant ( Group B ) . A control population match , healthy individual donate blood twice biomarker study validate assay ( Group C ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Original Protocol Group A : Patients least SLEDAI score 6 BILAG score B least two organ system A least one organ system immediately enter study inform consent obtain . Background immune suppressant ( ) stop half patient hydroxychloroquine also stop . All patient immediately receive shot depomedrol 160 mg IM . Over next two week could elect three shot depomedrol total four shot two week visit period . A complete battery blood test assess lupus disease drawn screen visit , monthly thereafter . Exploratory biomarker study draw often weekly marker often three time study ( landmark visit ) others . Protocol Changes course study : Biomarkers draw Day zero , week 2 week 4 monthly thereafter flare . Patients improve protocol steroid treatment withdraw Group A immediately treat warrant . Since protocol-defined improve visit , could continue protocol flare . However baseline sample appropriate study part Group B ( see ) . Landmark visit Group A define : 1 . ) screening ( pre-dose , background med active disease ) 2 . ) two week four week screen optimal assess patient stop background med maximally improve ( least one grade drop BILAG score organs enter A B four point drop SLEDAI , otherwise participant deem treatment failure could participate Group A . 3 . ) Flare visit background immune suppression define increase SLEDAI 4 point maximal improvement one new BILAG moderate ( B ) score AND investigator considers condition significant flare intent treat . Patients ( whenever possible ) see within 3 day flare visit flare occur monthly schedule visit . The primary purpose study evaluate time flare safety treatment withdrawal protocol patient active , non-organ threaten SLE . The following biomarkers obtain exploratory analysis : cytokine panel , B Cell study , T Cell study , autoantibody profile , epigenetic gene expression study flow cytometry study .</detailed_description>
