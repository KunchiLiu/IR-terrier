	<brief_title>Sandostatine® LP Hyperinsulinism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia infancy ( HI ) characterize inappropriate secretion insulin responsible profound hypoglycemia require aggressive treatment prevent severe irreversible brain damage . Thanks complementarity synergy paediatrician , paediatric surgeon , radiologist , pathologist geneticist , important stage reach : recognition two clinically similar form HI require radically different treatment : diffuse form focal form pancreas . The medical treatment base proglycem , diazoxide , octreotide ( Sandostatine ® , Novartis ) dose 10 50 µg/Kg/jour divide three subcutaneous injection . Most neonate resistant diazoxide side effect observe ( important edema hypertrichosis ) . The Sandostatine® much effective treatment , unfortunately short half-life painful injection . In case resistance medical treatment , distinction two form essential guide surgical treatment : partial pancreatectomy focal form , cure definitively hypoglycemia ; subtotal pancreatectomy diffuse form resist medical treatment , lead diabetes pancreatic exocrine insufficiency . Also , medical treatment essential case diffuse form avoid subtotal pancreatectomy . Mutations two gene encode potassium channel , SUR1 KIR6.2 , responsible hyperinsulinism resistant diazoxide . The Sandostatine® market Novartis exist two form , `` rapid '' form `` retarded liberation form '' . These two molecule approve treatment adult follow indication : - Treatment clinical symptom digestive endocrine tumour - Treatment acromegaly - Treatment primitive thyrotrope adenoma - Treatment unfunctional adenoma - Treatment corticotrope adenoma ( Nelson syndrome ) functional gonadotrope adenoma - After pancreatic surgery - Emergency treatment bleed secondary cirrhosis . Sandostatine® neither approval hyperinsulinism , child even though many international publication report efficacy treatment Sandostatine® hyperinsulinemic child since 1983 . Also , consensus international team take care hyperinsulinism infancy propose treatment patient . Ten child diffuse form hyperinsulinism treat department Sandostatine® give three subcutaneous injection several year , order avoid sub-total pancreatectomy . The possible adverse effect appearance vesicular lithiasis treat ursodesoxycholic acid . We change Sandostatine® treatment one patient Sandostatine® LP ( retarded liberation form ) write consent two parent . Thus could stop three injection per day Sandostatine® . Sandostatine® LP prove efficient hypoglycemias subcutaneous multi-daily injection ( SC ) . The glycemia value strictly normal , hypoglycaemia observe . Following observation , propose try substitute treatment Sandostatine® give several subcutaneous injection one injection Sandostatine® LP 10 child follow department Metabolism hyperinsulinism . The awaited result study demonstrate efficacy Sandostatine® LP thus replace Sandostatine® three daily subcutaneous injection single intramuscular injection Sandostatine® LP per month . This study contribute undeniable improvement quality life patient family .</detailed_description>
