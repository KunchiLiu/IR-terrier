	<brief_summary>Reduced aortic stiffness powerful way predict outcome cardiovascular ( CV ) disease . There several non invasive method estimation , base measurement speed arterial pulse wave . ( The stiffer artery , fast pulse wave travel . ) They rely detect arterial pulse 2 sensor place skin know distance apart measure time pulse travel . However current method require skilled operator limit accuracy . Thus , need easy use reliable device measure pulse speed . The aim project develop non contact device detect aortic pulse move small artery follow rib , use principle thermal imaging , mean high sensitivity infra red camera , direct towards subject back . The investigator plan validate device conduct small feasibility study patient undergo elective angiography , simultaneously measure pulse speed use establish method . These Doppler ultrasound ( non-invasive ) direct intra-arterial measurement ( gold standard ) .</brief_summary>
