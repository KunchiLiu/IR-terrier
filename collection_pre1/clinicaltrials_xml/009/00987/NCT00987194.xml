	<detailed_description>I . Background Recently , CDC issue recommendation call HIV screen patient age 13-64 , individual access health care system 1 . For many patient , especially without primary care provider , emergency department ( ED ) primary contact point health care system . Testing individual ED potential identify person perceive risk HIV . Several academic EDs begin offer HIV test 10 , initially indicate promising result . II . Rationale test ED Testing ED several potential advantage . It lead short hospital stay , increase number newly diagnose patient HIV discharge hospital aware HIV status , improve entry outpatient care patient admit time initial HIV diagnosis . Another advantage HIV test ED ability link newly diagnose patient HIV clinician . The optimal approach test HIV ED know . Testing without risk assessment identify person undiagnosed HIV infection reduce reluctance assess risk behavior . While widespread routine HIV screening ( e.g . test many patient possible present ED ) likely result high number positive test , strategy expensive , burdensome practical busy city ED . In set limited resource , strategy target test ( test patient establish risk factor HIV ) may cost-effective strategy . It may also practical may acceptable ED staff . Another issue need study identify optimal personnel conduct rapid HIV test ED . There advantage disadvantage require ED staff counsel consent patient HIV test . The ED staff may believe test purview may believe time devote testing . Another important issue feasibility conduct rapid test ED . How many individual test eight hour day one HIV educator ? What barriers conduct rapid test ED solution implement overcome barrier ? Finally , attitude ED staff regard HIV test ED ? By collect data implementation pilot project hope optimize approach HIV test ED . III . Hypothesis Primary - Initiation rapid HIV test program ED community teach hospital feasible require substantial resource cooperation multiple department stakeholder . Secondary- Patients know HIV risk factor higher HIV seroprevalence compare patient without know risk factor . IV . Study Objectives A . Primary : 1 . To initiate HIV test Baystate ED order increase number new HIV diagnosis link patient HIV care . B . Secondary : 1 . To estimate resource involve initiate rapid HIV test program ED large community teach hospital . 2 . To describe process initiate rapid HIV test program barrier implementation . 3 . To compare yield HIV test patient know HIV risk factor compare without know risk factor patient present ED order estimate feasibility random screen strategy compare target screen strategy . 4 . To describe characteristic population test HIV ED . 5 . To determine number patient decline test reason decline test . 6 . To determine number newly diagnose individual successfully link HIV provider number receive antiretroviral therapy within one year initial diagnosis . 7 . To analyze ED staff attitude : HIV rapid test ED V. Methods : Overview Operations : A trained HIV Health Educator offer HIV counsel test ED patient interested HIV testing . The number patient study determined many patient approach HIV Health Educator . Following initial counsel HIV Health educator obtain Informed Consent study participation HIV test well HIPPA authorization study participant . Patients decline test ask consent participate study sign research consent form ask reason ( ) decline test . The reason decline test record among agree participate . ED patient may also refer HIV Health Educator ED nurse clinician ( physician midlevel clinician ) nurse clinician believe HIV test indicate base potential risk factor HIV condition possibly relate ( part patient 's social medical history ) . Finally , patient ED patient ( otherwise approach test ) may also request test HIV ED . After identification potential patient accord one method , health educator approach patient otherwise engage ED staff person prior discharge ED . Patients approached fashion interfere normal flow ED visit . Patients ill approach ( opinion HIV health educator ED staff ) exclude , patient previously test positive HIV . The HIV Health Educator initial risk assessment brief pretest counsel prior obtain verbal write consent HIV test . Counseling consent Spanish patient whose primary language Spanish . ( A consent form translate Spanish . ) The Health Educator obtain blood via finger stick patient . The test run ( accord instruction package insert ) Health Educator designate area ED . Results read reactive non-reactive . In event non-reactive test patient inform result . During post-test counseling session patient give risk reduction information show harm reduction skill technique counsel appropriate behavior minimize risk HIV acquisition . The patient also offer opportunity retested future encourage visit I-CTR program sexually transmit disease hepatitis test vaccination need . Testing entirely voluntary confidential In case reactive rapid test client bring consultation room ED ensure privacy inform result preliminary reactive result HIV confirmatory test require . In case reactive test ( initial positive ) , venous blood sample draw HIV Health Educator confirmation via HIV Western blot . The HIV Health Educator license draw blood . A separate write consent HIV obtain prior obtain blood HIV Western blot . The Western blot send MA State laboratory expect result &lt; 5 business day . The result initial test confirmatory test enter patient medical record . The state Massachusetts Department Health name patient test . The reporting state positive HIV result do patient access medical care per state law e.g . patient 's health care provider report result state . This report part study . The HIV health educator extensive experience inform patients/clients positive HIV test result plan place counsel patient . The PI representative also available counsel patient positive HIV test result . In rare case catastrophic emotional reaction positive test result HIV health educator involve crisis team ( Behavioral Health Network ( BHN ) Crisis Services ) . The BHN crisis service team station ED experience counsel patient severely emotionally distraught . The BHN crisis team aware HIV rapid test program willing participate need . If patient problem he/she leave ED , he/she able contact HIV health educator , conjunction PI , make referral ( need ) psychological/psychiatric follow-up . Once patient follow health care provider HIV/ID clinic ( generally within 5 day ) ( see detail ) psychological issue arise health care provider make appropriate referral mental health provider . In case rapid HIV test reactive , HIV Health Educator responsible link patient appropriate medical care . An appointment HIV/ID clinic give patient prior discharge ED . The patient refer three Baystate Health Centers In event test patient leaf ED prior receipt test result counselor notify patient phone mail schedule appointment receipt result . A supportive referral mental health assessment counseling also make , need ( see ) . Survey Prior start rapid HIV test ED , brief electronic survey ( use Survey Monkey software ) conduct . The survey send via email ED physicians midlevel provider . The survey instruction explain survey voluntary confidential participant identify . The survey send individual first six month pilot program ass change attitude . VI . Data Management/Security The HIV Health Educator collect data clinical study purpose . Data store paper record , electronically . All patient information keep individual folder barcode . A barcode assign patient use specific identifier specimen test . Once test complete folder store lock file office principal investigator . There policy place maintain confidentiality privacy throughout entire test process : write consent , test performance , disclosure test result , storage record . We allow access researcher answer question without IRB approval . All file keep seven year . VII . ANALYSIS PLAN Demographic information obtain patient time test part pilot test record data collection sheet . Data collect include risk factor HIV , ethnicity , sex , age , payer status , zip code , homeless status , prior test status ( date prior test ) , co-morbid medical condition possibly relate HIV diagnosis chief complaint presentation ED . In addition , general demographic information patient admit ED study period request de-identified , appropriate , extrapolated calculation seroprevalence e.g . characteristic patient test HIV compare overall ED population order ascertain whether tested sample representative ED population . The number patient approach test record total number patient register ED period test ( eight hour per day , five day per week ) . The number reactive test well number positive confirmatory test determine . In order determine yield test estimate seroprevalence ED , number patient test positive ( confirmed Western blot ) divide total number test . Further calculation incorporate yield test risk factor compare report risk factor . In addition , number patient reactive test attend initial subsequent HIV clinic visit well number present AIDS diagnosis number commence antiretroviral therapy within one year test record . The HIV health educator observe record barrier test ED staff.. Modifications testing policy implement base assessment HIV health educator order maximize number patient test . No identify information concern ED staff member record . Modifications test policy implement base assessment order maximize number patient test . In order ascertain sustainability program , follow initial pilot program , cost HIV test estimate include follow cost : health educator salary plus benefit , program administration , material , test kit , postage confirmatory test . The cost per test , cost per approach patient , cost per enrol patient , cost per confirm infection detect calculate , annualized direct cost . Results survey tally . Pre post survey compare use Chi square categorical data ( e.g . yes , question ) Student 's T test continuous data . Data main study enter Microsoft Excel . StatView statistical software use analyze data . Categorical data analyze appropriate test e.g . Chi Square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous data analyze use Student 's T-test .</detailed_description>
