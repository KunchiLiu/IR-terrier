	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cell-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving rituximab together bendamustine hydrochloride lenalidomide may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose give rituximab together bendamustine hydrochloride lenalidomide treat patient aggressive B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose combination rituximab , bendamustine hydrochloride , lenalidomide patient aggressive B-cell lymphoma eligible anthracycline-based first-line treatment intensive regimen include high-dose therapy ( HDT ) follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) refractory relapse disease , treatment patient relapse HDT ASCT . ( phase I ) . - To identify recommend dose regimen phase II study ( phase I ) . - To determine efficacy safety regimen patient ( phase II ) . Secondary - To assess quality life ( QOL ) patient treat regimen ( phase II ) . - To evaluate usefulness feasibility SAKK Cancer-Specific Geriatric Assessment ( C-SGA ) patient treat regimen ( phase II ) . - To assess association WHO performance status , QOL indicator , SAKK C-SGA score ( phase II ) . - To describe change SAKK C-SGA score pre- post-treatment QOL ( phase II ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study bendamustine hydrochloride lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30-60 minute day 1-2 , oral lenalidomide day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients phase II study complete SAKK Cancer-Specific Geriatric Assessment baseline completion course 1 . Patients also complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
