	<brief_summary>Atopic keratoconjunctivitis ( AKC ) rare type ocular allergy often associate eczema . Over time , complication disease process lead loss vision due continual scar corneal surface . The pathophysiology AKC fully elucidate , trigger still unknown . Corticosteroids effective control acute symptom AKC . However , two third patient manage combination oral antihistamine , topical mast cell stabilizer , intermittent topical steroid regimen eventually develop significant keratopathy vision loss . Additionally , many side effect corticosteroid , include local immunosuppression , cataract formation , increase risk glaucoma . Cyclosporin A immunomodulator specifically inhibit T lymphocytes block expression interleukin-2 receptor . It also block release inflammatory mediator mast cell eosinophil . Cyclosporin known side effect except burn upon instillation , safe use long-term . The investigator demonstrate 0.05 % ophthalmic emulsion cyclosporine show effective improve ocular sign symptom AKC short-term . However , long-term efficacy cyclosporine A slow natural history AKC possible steroid spar effect assess . The investigator hypothesize cyclosporine A used mainstay treatment AKC control sign symptom long period time also prevent progression disease .</brief_summary>
