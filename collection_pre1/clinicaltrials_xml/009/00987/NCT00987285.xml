	<brief_summary>This project primarily behavioral study . We employ three-arm , patient-randomized practical effectiveness trial evaluate impact two different interactive , multimedia self-management program , relative `` enhance '' usual care . The two intervention ( ) revise program present study , base social-ecological theory 5 As self-management model , plus enhanced support ( ASM+ES ) include practical , extensive , ongoing support b ) largely Automated Self-Management ( ASM ) . These program compare realistic `` enhance usual care '' ( UC ) condition provide health risk appraisal feedback , control computer interaction , provide standardized advice behavior change , hypothesize key intervention process goal-setting , barrier identification , problem-solving , social-environmental support . Patients randomized condition within clinic participate 1 year . The propose project test effectiveness practical , automated-based intervention primary care patient facilitate dietary physical activity practice , medication-taking . Analyses focus primary outcome ( ) dietary , physical activity , medication-taking outcome , ( b ) UKPDS risk equation well secondary quality-of-life , patient-activation , patient care outcome ( Specific Aim # 2 ) . Using RE-AIM measure , analyze reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation , maintenance intervention program ( Specific Aim # 3 ) , also factor related program implementation , linkage primary care , program success emphasis cost , cost-effectiveness , mediator moderator outcomes social-environment support ( Aim # 4 ) . Primary hypothesis : 1 . That Automated Intervention receive Automated self-management ( ASM ) condition ASM plus enhanced support condition ( ASM+ES ) superior usual care primary outcome . 2 . That ASM+ES condition superior ASM alone condition primary outcomes 12-month follow-up .</brief_summary>
