	<detailed_description>D-cycloserine show enhance learn animal model , previous trial , once-weekly D-cycloserine improve negative symptom schizophrenia subject . We set test whether DCS combine cognitive remediation would improve learning practiced auditory discrimination task whether gain would generalize unpracticed cognitive task . The propose study consist 8-week , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group trial D-cycloserine augmentation cognitive remediation schizophrenia outpatient . The primary outcome measure change performance MATRICS cognitive battery composite score 8 week . Secondary outcome measure include measure process speed assess week 1 , 2 , 4 &amp; 8 , change negative symptom measure function 4 8 week . In addition , outcome measure repeat 6 month assess persistence benefit . Hypotheses : 1 . D-cycloserine significantly improve cognitive performance measure composite score MATRICS battery compare placebo 8 week cognitive remediation . 2 . D-cycloserine significantly improve negative symptom measure SANS compare placebo 8 week combine cognitive remediation . 3 . D-cycloserine significantly improve measure function ( GAS , QoL CGI ) 8 week compare placebo combine cognitive remediation . 4 . D-cycloserine effect cognition , negative symptom function persist compare placebo assess 6-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
