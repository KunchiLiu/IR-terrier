	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study evaluate many lymph node leave behind robotic-assisted removal find wide incision make , patient bladder remove treatment bladder cancer . The primary objective compare lymph node yield achieve perform robotic-assisted laparoscopic extend pelvic lymph node dissection ( RA-PLND ) compare second-look open lymph node dissection ( O-PLND ) among patient undergo radical cystectomy transitional cell carcinoma bladder . The secondary objective collect prospective outcome data related performance RA-PLND robotic-assisted cystectomy ( RA-C ) include operative time , estimate blood loss , transfusion , complication , return diet , utilization pain medication , hospital length , return regular activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Background : Research show lymph node remove part radical cystectomy ( bladder removal ) invasive bladder cancer , good . However , number lymph node remove varies person person . The standard surgical technique robot-assisted procedure new , researcher want able reliably tell specific number lymph node remove enough consider `` complete '' removal . In study , researcher remove require lymph node use standard robotic-assisted procedure , remove additional lymph node remain need remove , use wider ( `` open '' ) incision abdomen . This open technique also do standard care . It need order complete `` urinary diversion '' part surgery ( procedure surgically make way urine pas body go bladder ) . The main goal study see robotic-assisted procedure remove require lymph node . The open technique allow researcher evaluate many lymph node leave behind robotic-assisted removal . It possible machine may problem available use schedule day surgery . If happens , option reschedule surgery standard open surgery . It also possible machine could problem surgery . If happens , doctor continue standard open surgery . Your study doctor discus possible situation . You ask sign separate consent form surgical procedure , describe procedure risk detail . Follow-up : You ask fill brief pain survey week 7 week surgery . The survey take 5 minute complete . You also give diary record daily pain medication use . It also take 5 minute complete . You continue complete questionnaire week fill diary daily 6 week . End-of-Study Visit : You visit clinic 6-12 week surgery end-of-study visit . You chest x-ray . Your pain medication use pain level survey collect . After visit , off-study . This investigational study . The robotic-assisted bladder removal FDA approve purpose . Up 60 patient enrol study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>
