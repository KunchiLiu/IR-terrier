	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate investigational 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine determine vaccine safety pregnant woman body 's immune response ( body 's defense disease ) different strength H1N1 influenza vaccine . In study , 2 strength H1N1 influenza vaccine test ( give 3 week apart ) . Participants include approximately 120 healthy pregnant woman , age 18-39 year , second third trimester pregnancy ( 14-34 week gestation ) .

	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . In addition , adult likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . Pregnant woman increase risk complication influenza . A high dose multiple dos unadjuvanted , inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine may necessary confer protection risk population . This protocol explore antibody response follow vaccination pregnant woman 2 different dose level ( 15 mcg 30 mcg ) . The 2 dos inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine administer 21 day apart . This study assess immune response follow single dose H1N1 vaccine , ass whether individual pre-existing `` prime '' immunity , initial H1N1 vaccination serve boost , thus confer rapid time protection need few dos . Antibody response assess 21 day dose . The primary objective : safety , assess safety unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1influenza vaccine pregnant woman administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose ; immunogenicity , ass antibody response follow single dose unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine pregnant woman administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose . The secondary objective : ass antibody response follow 2 dos unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine pregnant woman administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose ; assess efficiency placental transport maternal influenza antigen specific antibody neonate . This randomized , double-blinded , phase II study 120 pregnant woman , age 18-39 year . Subjects randomize 2 group ( 60 pregnant woman per dose group ) receive intramuscular inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 1 ) 30 mcg ( Group 2 ) Days 0 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 ) , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month post first vaccination ( Day 201 ) . Reactogenicity vaccine assess 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include HAI neutralize antibody test serum obtain Days 0 , 21 42 . This include sample collect prior vaccination sample collect 21 day follow vaccination . HAI antibody test also perform serum maternal cord blood collect delivery .</detailed_description>
