	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen . It yet know whether give one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give letrozole surgery effective treat woman breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy surgery see well work compare letrozole give surgery treat postmenopausal woman breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Letrozole Before Surgery Treating Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare efficacy tolerability cytotoxic chemotherapy versus aromatase inhibition down-staging strongly ER+ primary breast cancer postmenopausal woman . - To identify biological predictor response two treatment modality . OUTLINE : This multicenter pilot , feasibility study follow randomize study . In pilot study , record patient screen invited participate study compile . Reasons failure recruit record . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive fluorouracil IV , epirubicin IV , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least partial response 3 course receive docetaxel IV day 1 3-week course additional 3 course . - Arm II : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 18-23 week day surgery . Patients arm undergo surgery week 18-23 . Most patient receive adjuvant therapy . Quality life assess baseline , periodically study treatment , follow . Blood collect pre-treatment , mid-treatment , surgery . Blood collect every 6 month 2 year . Blood sample preserve tumor sample use correlative study . After completion surgery , patient follow least annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient pilot study 716 patient phase III study accrue .</detailed_description>
