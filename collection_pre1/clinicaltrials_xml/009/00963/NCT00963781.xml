	<brief_summary>Despite benefit drug-eluting stent ( DES ) reduce need repeat revascularization procedure , concern regard late stent thrombosis ( ST ) lead recent guideline advocate extended prescription dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) aspirin thienopyridine ( clopidogrel ticlopidine ] ) beyond describe product labeling . Specifically , advisory recommend least 1 year DAPT follow treatment DES patient without contraindication . However , recommendation largely empiric base trial show reduction ST long-term DAPT , potential safety difference DES consider . Further , study examine balance potential efficacy long-term DAPT relative increase bleeding risk . A consistency across clinical trial involve Endeavor DES low rate late myocardial infarction , cardiac death ST . Unlike DES , recent study indicate Endeavor stent may permit rapid complete heal stent strut addition restore normal blood vessel function . Further , patient treat Endeavor stent , long-term safety outcome similar 3 year follow-up irrespective whether patient adherent DAPT duration ≤ 6 month , 12 month 24 month . In study , long-term safety effectiveness examine patient treat Endeavor stent assign DAPT reduce duration 6 month . If study demonstrate safety efficacy , could influence treatment guideline favor abbreviated duration DAPT patient treat Endeavor stent . This would mean bleed complication need surgery arise less 12 month post-PCI , patient treat Endeavor stent could stop DAPT 6 month reasonable estimate safety . Furthermore , possible patient currently deny DES due know need elective surgery could treat Endeavor stent case surgery temporarily delay . Finally , could additional option patient forgo treatment DES favor bare metal stent ( BMS ) fear possible bleed long-term DAPT . Finally , recognize patient respond way anti-platelet therapy . Recent study indicate inherited genetic variation way body metabolize anti-platelet medication may important determinant responsiveness thienopyridine therapy , difference may also confer high likelihood adverse outcome . Patients agree additional genetic sub-study DNA sample take baseline test presence gene relate antiplatelet therapy metabolism effectiveness . The result test could help medical community well understand individual variation response anti-platelet therapy role genetics may play determine response . It possible information gain could help physician tailor DAPT patient patient basis .</brief_summary>
