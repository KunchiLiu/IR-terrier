	<brief_summary>The purpose study see body reacts different strength H1N1 flu shot give without `` adjuvant . '' An adjuvant substance may cause body produce antibody give vaccine . This study also compare age affect body 's response H1N1 flu shot . In study , 3 strength H1N1 flu shot test combined adjuvant . In addition , 2 strength H1N1 flu shot test without adjuvant . Two H1N1 flu shot strength , without adjuvant , give 3 week apart . Participants include 800 healthy adult , approximately 500 individual age 18-64 250 individual great equal age 65 .

	<brief_title>Sanofi H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Administered Different Dose Levels With Without AS03 Adjuvant Healthy Adult Elderly Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . Adults likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . This protocol explore antibody response follow vaccination inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine 3 different dose level combine AS03 adjuvant 2 different dose level administer without adjuvant . This study assess immune response follow single dose vaccine without AS03 adjuvant , ass whether individual pre-existing 'prime ' immunity , initial H1N1 vaccination serve boost , thus confer rapid time protection need few dos . Antibody response assess 8 day dose evaluate development anamnestic response . In addition , antibody response assess 21 day dose . The primary objective : safety , assess safety inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 microgram ( mcg ) , 7.5 mcg , 15 mcg dose combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 mcg 15 mcg dose administer without adjuvant ; immunogenicity , ass antibody response Day 21 follow single dose inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 mcg , 7.5 mcg , 15 mcg dose combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 mcg 15 mcg dose administer without adjuvant , stratify age recipient . The secondary objective immunogenicity , ass antibody response follow 2 dos inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer 3.75 mcg , 7.5 mcg , 15 mcg dose combine AS03 adjuvant 7.5 mcg 15 mcg dose administer without adjuvant , stratify age recipient . Participants include 800 healthy adult history novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase II study . Subjects randomize 5 group , stratify age ( 150 subject per dose group 100 subject 18-64 year age stratum 50 subject great equal 65 year age stratum ) , receive intramuscular inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 3.75 mcg , 7.5 mcg , 15 mcg combine AS03 adjuvant ( Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively ) 7.5 mcg 15 mcg without adjuvant ( Groups 4 5 , respectively ) . The vaccine , without adjuvant , administer Day 0 Day 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event ( AEs ) 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive dos Day 21 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition 12 month post final vaccination ( Day 365 second vaccination ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day ( Day 0-7 ) follow vaccination . Immunogenicity test include HAI neutralize antibody .</detailed_description>
