	<brief_summary>Rationale : Due advance technology last decade , increasingly treatment option available head neck cancer ( HNC ) . As consequence decision-making regard choose best available treatment option become increasingly relevant . Quality life weight ( utility score ) important outcome measure decision-making process . Utility score combine life expectancy , result Quality Adjusted Life Year ( QALY ) . If economic evaluation outcome express QALYs gain , possible compare efficiency different intervention different indication . However , limited evidence utility score treatment HNC available . Objective : The investigator ' main objective examine quality life ( QoL ) , utility score disease specific quality life , different treatment modality HNC . Secondary objective examine whether QoL differs across health state , factor influence QoL . As extensive data available disease-specific quality life , another objective examine whether utility score derive commonly use disease-specific questionnaire , EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H &amp; N35 . If would possible , would limit patient burden future clinical trial . Finally , mean measure patient ' ability perform work , diet dental consequence investigator aim measure impact HNC treatment . Study design : The investigator ' study design cross-sectional survey . Study population : The study population consist patient HNC treat least six month ago curative radiotherapy and/or surgery without chemotherapy . Intervention/method : Patients ask fill single set questionnaire ( once-only ) . The set questionnaire consist three validated questionnaire , concern health state utility ( EuroQol-5D ) , disease-specific quality life ( EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H &amp; N35 ) productivity loss ( PRODISQ ) . In addition , two question inquire patient ' diet three question consider dental status patient add questionnaire . To classify patient certain health state , physician ask score adverse event patient follow-up visit ( accord RTOG classification ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter QoL ( disease specific quality life utility score ) certain health state . These utility score use future cost-effectiveness study identify best available treatment option . Other important study parameter factor influence QoL , relationship utility score disease-specific quality life . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : As study involve set questionnaire , burden minimal . No risk expect associated participation . It important gain insight QoL , patient ' ability perform work , diet dental consequence long-term follow-up HNC patient , allow evidence-based decision-making regard treatment option HNC .</brief_summary>
