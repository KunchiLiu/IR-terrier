	<brief_summary>This study do compare special type Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan CT scan patient surgically removable lung cancer see method useful measure response treatment . A PET scan us small amount radioactive material inject blood show internal working body . In study , use two radioactive material : 18F-FLT ( referred FLT ) 18F-FDG ( refer FDG ) . FDG use routinely stag lung cancer approve FDA purpose . FLT use special type PET scan assess study . In addition study assess effect combination docetaxel cisplatin ( chemotherapeutic drug ) certain pathological characteristic tumor . The combination docetaxel cisplatin approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advanced/metastatic NSCLC ( non-small cell lung cancer ) . It approve use patient surgically removable NSCLC . In case cisplatin use single drug therapy surgery . The FDA allow use docetaxel along cisplatin research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine absolute decrease measure primary tumor 18 F-F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine ( FLT ) uptake ( standard uptake value [ SUV ] influx constant [ Ki ] ) pre-treatment image image first cycle therapy differs patient categorized responder non-responders base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) measure compute tomography ( CT ) second cycle therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine absolute decrease measure primary tumor FDG uptake ( SUV ) pre-treatment image image first cycle therapy differs patient categorized responder non-responders base RECIST measure CT second cycle therapy . II . To assess effect combination docetaxel cisplatin fractional tumor viability proliferative fraction pre post treatment correlate PET SUV data tracer . III . To assess methylation status checkpoint forkhead ring finger domain gene ( CHFR ) gene pre-treatment tumor biopsy correlate methylation status post treatment clinical pathologic response . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) cisplatin IV day 1 dexamethasone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo FDG PET/CT , FLT PET/CT , thoracic CT baseline end course 1 2 undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
