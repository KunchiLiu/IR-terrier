	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether outpatient combination lovastatin low-to-moderate dose interferon effective treatment patient malignant melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Interferon-Lovastatin Therapy Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant melanoma , simply melanoma , potentially fatal cancer begin skin cancer spread aggressively . The incidence melanoma rise rapidly last decade become serious health threat young adult well old adult . Unfortunately , melanoma escape complete surgical removal , treatment find effective control growth spread . If cancer spread lymph node system beyond , chance long-term survival poor . This study propose test effectiveness melanoma treatment combination two medicine widespread use medical condition . Interferon alfa-2b ( also know simply interferon brand name Intron-A ) exact replica protein produce human immune system . The human body make immune system regulator help kill cell body damage infected thus need remove cause harm body . This medicine often prescribed infection like hepatitis , type cancer include melanoma , immune system disorder . This study use interferon moderate dos , much less typically used melanoma treatment use alone , side effect treatment may milder . The medicine use combination lovastatin . This medicine often use help patient reduce cholesterol level therefore reduce risk heart attack stroke . Millions people use medicine find safe effective . Research show also significant effect growth cancer cell laboratory culture animal model . These two medicine use together treat patient cancer several year medical practice , formally test clinical trial . This study test well combination medicine perform test hypothesis achieve good survival control disease currently available standard treatment . The incidence side effect detail monitor . This study open qualify patient stage 2 , 3 , 4 melanoma . The result patient group compare patient study similar stage disease historical result patient receive standard , already-approved treatment similar stage melanoma .</detailed_description>
