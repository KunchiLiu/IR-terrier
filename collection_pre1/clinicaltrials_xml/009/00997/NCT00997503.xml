	<detailed_description>The TAXUS Libertē Post-Approval Study FDA-mandated prospective , multi-center study design collect real-world safety clinical outcome approximately 4,200 patient receive one TAXUS Liberté Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents prasugrel part dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) drug regimen . This consecutively-enrolled study patient follow-up 3 year post index procedure . This study also contribute patient data FDA-requested industry-sponsored research study evaluate optimal duration dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT Study ) . To facilitate patient data contribution , patient assign patient group base upon co-morbidities stented lesion identify post index procedure . All enrol patient treat TAXUS Liberté Stent assign 12 month open-label prasugrel treatment aspirin . Upon completion open-label period , patient clear event 12 month post index procedure randomize 1:1 either placebo prasugrel additional 18 month treatment . All patient receive aspirin therapy throughout course study .</detailed_description>
