	<brief_title>Japanese National Computed Tomographic ( CT ) Colonography Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate sensitivity CTC detect colorectal polyp cancer ( least 6 mm diameter ) 1,500 subject increase risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , use optical colonoscopy reference standard . The primary endpoint sensitivity detection colorectal polyp cancer least 6 mm diameter . The secondary endpoint include specificity predictive value detection colorectal polyp cancer . This clinical study also evaluate difference detection accuracy human reading without computer-aided detection ( CAD ) automatically detect colonic lesion CTC image present detected lesion reader . This clinical study also compare performance radiologist gastroenterologist detect colorectal lesion CTC image . All CTC image interpretation , optical colonoscopy report image , pathology report resect colorectal lesion prospectively collect 12 Japanese hospital participate trial . All patient ' information completely anonymized site analysis data take place .</detailed_description>
