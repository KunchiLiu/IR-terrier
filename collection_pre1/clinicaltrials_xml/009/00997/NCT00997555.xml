	<brief_title>Prophylactic Bronchoscopy After Inhalation Injury Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role bronchoscopy hospital limit obtain lavage fluid culture assess degree airway injury , show predictive outcome . Severe inhalation injury , characterize pulmonary edema , bronchial edema , secretion , occlude airway lead atelectasis pneumonia . Aggressive use bronchoscopy highly effective remove foreign particle accumulate secretion worsen inflammatory response impede ventilation . While seem intuitive bronchoscopy would improve pulmonary hygiene remove secretion denude epithelial slough burn patient , publish data support deter use bronchoscopy inhalation injury document improvement morbidity mortality secondary bronchoscopy therapeutic intervention . Recent research show process intubation mechanical ventilation provide portal bacterial contamination , damage tracheobronchial mucosa quickly become colonized pathogenic organism 50 % patient . Furthermore , within 15 minute smoke inhalation , significant airway edema thickening , prominently low trachea upper portion . These factor place patient inhalation injury high risk pneumonia . We use National Burn Repository data previously show patient receive aggressive use bronchoscopy inhalation injury improve outcome term decrease ventilator day , decrease ICU length stay , decrease incidence pneumonia , trend towards improve mortality . However , data unable document . It also unable confirm finding due institutional bias . Therefore , one conclusion study prospective trial need confirm finding . Our hypothesis schedule sequential use bronchoscopy inhalation injury therapeutic tool remove secretion , slough , carbonaceous material , screen early detection pneumonia bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) improve outcome . We attempt document improvement use follow endpoint : length ICU stay , length hospital stay , ventilator day , incidence pneumonia , overall morbidity mortality without bronchoscopy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any burned patient arrive intubated mechanical ventilation OR require mechanical ventilation within 48 hour admission AND 2 . &gt; 18 year old AND 3. patient believe able survive 48 hour arrival ( likely make DNR comfort care ) include : methamphetamine explosion burn associate fire ( chemical ) face blast injury face confine burn space 10 minute burn carbonaceous material around nose mouth burn &gt; 15 % TBSA associate fire ( chemical ) burn associate explosion confine space . 1 . Likely die within 48 hour base upon severity injury . 2 . Less 18 year old . 3 . Burned patient transfer facility already mechanical ventilation 48 hour . 4 . Patient already antibiotics another reason .</criteria>
