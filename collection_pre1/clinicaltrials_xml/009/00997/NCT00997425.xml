	<detailed_description>Introduction : Wandering behavior manifest way include linger near exit door and/or mimic `` shadow '' exit behavior others depart door . Referenced `` exit-seeking , '' behavior common mobility pattern place person dementia wander ( PDW ) high risk wander away elope . PDW wander away care set unattended risk death exposure accidents lose quickly find , wander away persist behavior risk fall , fracture injury , weight loss , fatigue sleep disturbance . Traditional method manage PDW exit-seeking wander away include physical restraint pharmacology , harmful . Subjective `` visual exit barrier '' deter exit-seeking offer attractive alternative intervention non-invasive , low-cost simple use . Nursing home test visual exit barrier plain cloth door cover stripped floor cover demonstrate positive result reduce completely exit-seeking behavior . Confirmation result well design , home-based trial warrant . Research Questions/Hypotheses : The research question hypotheses 2-year , cross-over assignment randomize allocation design two intervention two no-intervention period ( baseline first intervention ) : Q1 . Will installation visual barrier intervention change exit-seeking wandering patter , control cognitive impairment ? H1 . Compared baseline , installation visual exit barrier low frequency duration exit-seeking behavior . Q2 . Of two visual barrier ( door floor ) , result great reduction wandering ( frequency duration linger shadow ) ? H2 . Door cover reduce exit seek floor cover . Five secondary question propose descriptive purpose generate hypothesis future study wander management intervention . These include : Q3 . What baseline characteristic exit-seeking ( predominant locus , duration variability duration wake hour ) ? Q4 . Will introduction visual barrier one exit doorway alter exit-seeking behavior occur proximity potential exit door windows within area ? Q5 . Will introduction visual exit barrier reduce CG ( caregiver ) burden ? Q6 . Will introduction visual exit barrier increase PDW agitation ? Q7 . How CG rate visual barrier effectiveness acceptability in-home use ? Methods : A crossover assignment randomize order allocation design use . One main exit doorway sequentially protect two type ( door , floor ) visual barrier . Data relate exit-seeking subject collect via ultrawide radio frequency identification device continuous basis four 14-day period : Entry monitor zone 6-feet front exit doorway consider exit-seeking behavior ; PDW locomotion tandem CG locomotion consider shadow . Caregiver-reported PDW agitation CG burden collect baseline immediate post-interventions . Prior statistical analysis , variable review valid data point normalcy continuous data . Should erroneous data point exist , data verify ensure accuracy . Should data normally distribute , process transformation truncation complete . Prior conduct formal hypothesis testing , order allocation analysis complete determine carry-over effect occur study . Analysis ( Pocock ) complete , essence examines mean difference use t-statistics . In addition , intent treat analysis complete . Given incorporated second baseline phase study , frequency duration compare two baseline phase ensure consistency . Descriptive statistic ( frequency distribution categorical variable , mean standard deviation continuous variable ) calculate baseline variable include covariates .</detailed_description>
