	<brief_summary>The purpose research study assess frequency development mutation ( especially EGFR mutation ) lead resistance erlotinib people non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The investigator also look see participant 's NSCLC improve erlotinib may eventually stop respond erlotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Therapy Subsequent Development Mechanisms Secondary Resistance Patients With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants take erlotinib orally day . Each treatment cycle last 28 day . - While study , participant require see clinic Day 1 treatment cycle . During visit , follow test procedure do : physical exam blood test . They also return blood work Cyle 1 Day 8 . - At end every two cycle assessment participant 's tumor do CT and/or MRI ( part regular cancer care ) well follow : Urine test blood test . - At end study treatment follow procedure do : blood test , assessment tumor CT and/or MRI new biopsy tumor removal fluid contain tumor cell .</detailed_description>
