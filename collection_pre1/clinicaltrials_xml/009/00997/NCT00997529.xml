	<brief_summary>A major focus recent research development effective way sensitize patient 's immune system recognize cancer foreign . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent novel way potentially achieving goal . There recent evidence non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation provide effective therapy patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Based preliminary report investigator treat patient breast ovarian cancer , investigator study would propose treat expanded cohort patient metastatic solid tumor . The principal endpoint trial include incidence durable engraftment , quality hematopoietic immune reconstitution , extent donor chimerism , incidence severity acute chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , incidence long-term disease free survival ( DFS ) . The investigator evaluate tumor response patient stable progressive disease post-transplant donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . The investigator also study effect DLI T-cell immunity recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial pilot study patient metastatic solid tumor undergo non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Patients whose immunosuppressive therapy taper , without GVHD , evidence residual progressive disease undergo DLI . In recent year attempt harness graft-versus-tumor effect allogeneic bone marrow transplant treat patient metastatic solid tumor . Researchers NIH recently report 19 patient refractory metastatic renal-cell carcinoma suitable donor receive preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow infusion peripheral-blood stem-cell allograft HLA-identical sibling sibling mismatch single HLA antigen.49 They note time last follow-up , 9 19 patient alive 287 831 day transplantation ( median follow-up : 402 day ) . Two die transplantation-related cause 8 progressive disease . In 10 patient ( 53 % ) metastatic disease regress : 3 complete response , 7 partial response . The patient complete response remain remission 27 , 25 , 16 month transplantation . Regression metastases delay , occur median 129 day transplantation , often follow withdrawal cyclosporine establishment complete donor T-cell chimerism . They conclude result consistent graft-versus-tumor effect non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation induce sustain regression metastatic RCCA patient response conventional immunotherapy .</detailed_description>
