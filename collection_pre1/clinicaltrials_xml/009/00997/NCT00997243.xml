	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , lintuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody may better way block cancer growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give azacitidine together lintuzumab work treat patient previously untreated myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Lintuzumab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine complete response rate combination lintuzumab azacitidine patient myelodysplastic syndrome . Secondary - To define specific toxicity regimen . - To determine overall response rate . - To determine relationship pretreatment expression Syk clinical response . - To determine whether investigational agent modulate Syk expression correlate drug-induced change Syk response treatment . - To provide preliminary data biological activity azacitidine demethylating agent ( change target gene methylation gene expression , DNMT1 protein expression , global methylation ) . - To perform exploratory study azacitidine-triphosphate global DNA methylation . - To explore biologic role microRNA determine clinical response regimen achievement pharmacodynamic endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients receive azacitidine IV subcutaneously daily day 1-7 lintuzumab IV day 2 , 7 , 15 , 22 ( day 2 15 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment modification may apply accord response . Blood bone marrow sample collect periodically pharmacodynamic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : Age &gt; 18 untreated MDS FAB WHO criteria ( note : FAB criterion MDS include &lt; 29 % blast ; FAB criterion include CMML ) . Patients therapy related disease ( tMDS ) . If patient comorbid medical illness , life expectancy attribute must great 6 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . Must adequate organ function define : total bilirubin &lt; 2.0mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 2.0mg/dL NYHA CHF ( congestive heart failure ) Class II good Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . CD33 expression require least 25 % leave shifted dysplastic myeloid cell , include blast . This test do bone marrow aspirate , patient whose CD33 expression cellular compartment ascertain , peripheral blood allow determine . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 6 month ( cancer ) prior enter study . Patients receive investigational agent patient receive investigational agent within 1 month enrollment . Patients active central nervous system disease granulocytic sarcoma sole site disease . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZA lintuzumab easily manage exclude . Patients hypersensitivity mannitol exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , serious cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . As infection common feature MDS , patient active infection permit enroll provide infection control . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Psychiatric condition prevent compliance protocol consent . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed exclude study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible . Patients serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Patients serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Patients baseline fibrinogen &lt; 100mg/dL , clinically significant disseminate intravascular coagulation , exclude . Patients require ongoing therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin , lovenox , similar agent exclude . This apply patient low dose prophylaxis therapy . Patients require ongoing clopidogrel therapy exclude . In case clopidogrel use screen subsequently discontinue due ongoing future risk drug treatment relate cytopenia , patient eligible . Patients platelet &lt; 10,000/uL refractory platelet transfusion eligible ( must bump least &gt; 10,000/uL transfusion ) Patients previously receive lenalidomide thalidomide exclude .</criteria>
