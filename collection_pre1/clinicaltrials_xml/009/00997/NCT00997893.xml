	<detailed_description>Recent research suggest addition play role disease prevention menopausal symptom reduction , phytoestrogens reduce anxiety-related behavior animal improve memory animal human . This project seek investigate potential anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) cognition-enhancing effect phytoestrogen treatment , comparison another popular treatment , estradiol , placebo , perimenopausal woman . Given detrimental effect stress memory performance , widely use laboratory stressor implement investigate whether phytoestrogens and/or estradiol enhance memory counteract negative effect stress memory process . Estrogen Anxiety Recent animal study suggest estrogen play important role modulate anxiety , yet little human research topic . Research suggest anxiolytic effect estrogens mediate estrogen receptor-beta 1 ( ER-beta ) , one two know estrogen receptor brain 2 . ER-beta agonist decrease release stress hormone immobilization stress rat compare treatment treatment ER-alpha agonist 3 . Additionally , transgenic female mouse lack ER-beta exhibit increased anxiety decrease serotonin several brain area , include hippocampus 4 . The regulation anxiety ER-beta likely related effect ER-beta serotonin transmission 5 . The inhibition anxiety-related behavior female rat mediate ER-beta hippocampus 6 . Whereas ER-beta agonist decrease anxiety-related behavior female rat , ER-alpha agonist may work opposite fashion 3,7 . Phytoestrogens Anxiety Unlike estrogen , bind equally ER-alpha ER-beta , phytoestrogens much great affinity ER-beta ER-alpha 8 . Phytoestrogens plant compound structurally functionally similar endogenous estrogen currently widely investigate determine potential role disease prevention . Phytoestrogens show anxiolytic effect female rat . Specifically , female rat feed soy diet soy supplement exhibit less anxiety-related behavior well-validated behavioral maze task compare control-fed counterpart 9 . Though animal literature support role phytoestrogens reduce anxiety and/or stress response follow acute stressor , current research human inconclusive base self-report measure day-to-day stress rather responses acute stressor . Trials examine effect different soy-based preparation diet cognition menopausal complaint yield inconsistent result . To date , three trial find improved overall mood , depressive symptom , anxiety symptom good reaction stress test 10,11 five trial show change outcomes 12-15 . No human study examine potential anxiolytic effect phytoestrogens stress anxiety follow laboratory stressor . Past study show mixed evidence whether phytoestrogens beneficial regard menopausal symptom . A recent study show woman specific intestinal microflora , thus able produce isoflavan equol , one receive benefit phytoestrogens , reduce anxiety , equol great estrogenic activity affinity estrogen receptor ( Ishiwata et al. , 2009 ) . Stress Anxiety Midlife Women Recent study demonstrate notable age sex difference stress responsivity . Postmenopausal woman large increase salivary cortisol psychosocial laboratory stressor compare premenopausal woman 16 . This finding corroborate recent meta-analysis indicate effect age cortisol response pharmacological psychological challenge three time great woman compare men 17 . A community-based study adult 70 find great 12-hour free cortisol excretion associate poor delayed verbal recall woman 18 . Women study exhibited increase cortisol excretion two half year later likely show decline memory performance time compare woman without increased cortisol excretion . Using well-validated psychosocial laboratory stressor , Wolf colleague find strong detrimental effect psychosocial stress visual-verbal memory ( pictorial memory common item ) old woman compare old men 19 . These data suggest intervention low cortisol , particularly woman , may lower age-related memory decline . Phytoestrogens Cognition Soy isoflavones show enhance hippocampal ( memory ) frontal lobe ( executive ) function clinical trial animal study . Research indicate neuroprotective property phytoestrogens include positive impact choline acetyltransferase nerve growth factor hippocampus frontal cortex female rat 20 weaken tau phosphorylations associate Alzheimer 's disease primates 21 . Cognitive improvement enhance work memory visual-spatial memory note female rat feed phytoestrogen-rich diet supplement 22 . Clinical trial reveal consistent improvement mental flexibility planning ability ( complex executive task ) sample postmenopausal woman ( 17 , 18 ) well young men woman ( 16 ) . Further research examine effect phytoestrogens executive task warrant , many trial , include large recently publish trial adequately test cognitive domain ( 15 , 19-21 , Ho et al. , 2007 ) . To date , seven randomize trial human publish examine effect phytoestrogens verbal memory . Results indicate significant verbal memory improvement phytoestrogens young men woman 11 non-significant trend toward improved verbal memory four additional trial young postmenopausal woman 12,13 . Phytoestrogen treatment benefit verbal memory one trial involve old postmenopausal woman 14 recent trial woman age 55-76 ( Ho et al. , 2007 ) . Interestingly , finding largely consistent `` critical period hypothesis '' propose estrogen therapy benefit cognitive function initiate menopausal transition shortly thereafter 23 . Accumulating evidence suggest phytoestrogen treatment may also specifically enhance cognition early menopause .</detailed_description>
