	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine non-surgical periodontal therapy ( scale root plan supportive periodontal therapy ) efficacious compare delayed therapy reduce elevate glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 6 month post-randomization subject type 2 diabetes untreated , moderate advance chronic periodontitis . The secondary aim study : 1. evaluate whether 6 month ( shorter-term ( 3 month ) ) change clinical measure chronic periodontitis ( gingival index , bleed probing , probe depth , clinical attachment level ) relate change HbA1c fast glucose insulin resistance measure Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 ( HOMA2 ) . 2. assess 3 month 6 month efficacy periodontal therapy study outcome . If treatment response observe study outcomes 3 month , trial evaluate whether response sustain 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , randomize , control , single-masked , Phase III trial determine non-surgical periodontal therapy ( scale root plan ) efficacious reduce elevate glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 6 month post-randomization subject type 2 diabetes untreated , moderate advance chronic periodontitis . Six hundred adult diagnosis type 2 diabetes chronic periodontitis randomize three Clinical Sites ; University Alabama Birmingham ; University Minnesota , Minneapolis ; University Texas Health Science Center , San Antonio . The Core Laboratory locate University Minnesota Study Chair 's Office Coordinating Center locate Stony Brook University , Stony Brook , New York . Eligible participant randomly assign receive either initial non-surgical periodontal therapy chlorhexidine rinse ( treatment subject ) delay non-surgical periodontal therapy ( control subject ) . Control subject offer delayed periodontal therapy ( scale root plan ) follow 6 month visit . Participants meet eligibility criterion need essential dental care , i.e. , broken , grossly carious abscessed teeth , may enroll follow completion necessary dental treatment . Participants study arm receive oral hygiene instruction healthy lifestyle information ( e.g . diet , exercise ) baseline 3 6 month visit . Periodontal data record trained calibrated examiner baseline 3 6 month follow randomization . Fasting blood collect baseline 3 6 month measure intermediate link putative causal chain periodontitis glycemic control . The periodontal health subject monitor , subject experience progressive periodontitis study provide non-surgical rescue therapy .</detailed_description>
