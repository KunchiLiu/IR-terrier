	<detailed_description>Study design This multi center , prospective , post market surveillance study diabetic patient underwent CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent implantation . For comparison , non-diabetic patient treated SES concurrent period simultaneously enrol . Data collect consecutive subject treat commercially available product follow standard clinical practice . This registry limit subject receive CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent index procedure . All subject treat accord Instructions For Use ( IFU ) include conduct stenting procedure administration anti-platelet diabetic medication ; medical therapy provide accord local standard care . Brief study design depict following figure . STUDY POPULATION The registry conduct approximately 15 center Korea CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent approve commercial use . Data collect approximately 3,600 subject treat CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent . Assuming proportion diabetic patient 30 % , approximately 1,100 diabetic patient enrol . Enrolled diabetic patient confirm diagnosed Diabetes index procedure hospitalization , i.e. , receive active treatment oral hypoglycemic agent insulin , patient diagnosis diabetes dietary therapy alone patient abnormal blood glucose level overnight fast . Enrolled non-diabetic patient treat CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent .
