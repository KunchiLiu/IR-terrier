	<brief_title>Trial Sorafenib Hepatocellular Cancer ( HCC ) Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) oral multi-kinase inhibitor effect tumor proliferation angiogenesis . Sorafenib approve treatment patient advance renal cancer unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The recommended daily dose Sorafenib 400 mg ( 2 x 200 mg tablet ) take twice daily without food ( least 1 hour 2 hour meal ) . Studies single-agent sorafenib show treatment well-tolerated manageable side effect . The result see sorafenib Phase III ( SHARP ) trial suggest VEGF RAF kinase inhibition prolong survival patient advance HCC . It know whether drug consider primarily cytostatic effective preventing cancer recurrence set minimal residual disease . This phase I , single center , open-label , dose-escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) overall safety profile daily sorafenib therapy prevent HCC recurrence liver transplant subject high-risk HCC . For subject , study consist two phase : treatment phase extension phase .</detailed_description>
