	<detailed_description>Mycophenolate Mofetil ( CellCept ) prodrug whose active metabolite , mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , act immune suppressant inhibiting de novo guanosine synthesis . CellCept FDA approve prevent rejection transplant organ . It well tolerate , orally dose , know antitumor effect . It never study pancreatic cancer maximum tolerate dose know . In vitro study lab human pancreatic cancer line find MPA potent inhibitor pancreatic cancer cell growth induce apoptosis . The objective study identify maximum tolerate dose CellCept patient advance pancreatic cancer fail least two prior chemotherapy regimens assess pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>
