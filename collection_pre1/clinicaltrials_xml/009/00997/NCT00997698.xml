	<detailed_description>Intracranial aneurysm common report increased incidence rate widespread use high-resolution image technique . They clinically important life-threatening rupture hemorrhage . Early detection diagnosis key treatment . Contrast-enhanced MR angiography ( CE-MRA ) , simple , sensitivity noninvasive method , play important role Vascular Imaging . CE-MRA accuracy modality intracranial aneurysm center prove high sensitivity accuracy compare DSA . Therefore , use CE-MRA 1.5T tool epidemiological investigation intracranial aneurysm . In retrospective analysis , conventional risk factor intracranial aneurysm include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , smoke history , family history , etc . However , retrospective analysis probably give underestimation overestimation actual result . Prospective analysis get accurate data risk factor relate intracranial aneurysm</detailed_description>
