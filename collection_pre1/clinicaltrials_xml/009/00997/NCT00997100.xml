	<brief_summary>This exploratory open label single arm study evaluate change disease activity biomarkers patient mild active SLE , treatment ABR-215757 give add-on standard therapy . To eligible study SLE patient present symptom skin , mouth and/or joint . After screen period one week patient treat ABR-215757 12 week . The initial dose ABR-215757 1.5 mg/day . There option increase dose 3.0 mg/day follow 28 day treatment . Follow-up visit take place 4 week 8 week last day treatment . Disease activity treatment study use Systemic Lupus Erythematosus disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI-2K ) well organ system specific disease activity index ( CLASI skin involvement number swollen/tender joint use 28- 66/68-joint count ) . At specified time point study , blood sample biopsy collect analysis establish exploratory biomarkers SLE . Concomitant SLE treatment allow include : prednisolone equivalent dose ≤15 mg/day , hydroxychloroquine , azathioprine , methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil , stable dos specify timepoints prior study throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient initially receive ABR-215757 1.5 mg/day . There option increase dose 3.0 mg/day follow 28 day treatment . The select dose level ( 1.5 3.0 mg/day ABR-215757 ) predict effective base preclinical study autoimmune disease include SLE MRL model . Previous experience human well preclinical model support safe administration ABR-215757 dose include 3.0 mg/day . The duration study expect sufficient detect change disease activity group patient . Near steady state plasma level ABR-215757 human reach 14 day .</detailed_description>

Laboratory value follow Hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN 5 . Ability take retain oral medication 6 . Ability sign date write informed consent prior enter study 7 . Willingness ability comply protocol duration study 1 . Active severe SLE flare central nervous system ( CNS ) manifestation , active renal lupus , systemic vasculitis , active pericarditis , active pleuritis , active peritonitis SLE manifestation require treatment allow study protocol . 2 . Severe renal impairment ( estimate measure GFR &lt; 50 % ) 3 . Oral treatment corticosteroid ( &gt; 15 mg/day prednisolone equivalent ) change corticosteroid dose within 30 day prior first dose study medication . This also include intraarticular steroid injection topical treatment SLE symptom . Inhaled topical steroid may give reason SLE disease activity ( asthma , contact dermatitis ) clinically indicate . 4 . Intravenous corticosteroid within 3 month prior first dose study medication . 5 . Intravenous cyclophosphamide within 6 month prior first dose study medication . 6 . Treatment antirheumatic/immunosuppressive drug within 3 month prior first dose study medication , follow medication stable dos : methotrexate ( ≤25 mg/week ) , azathioprine ( ≤2.5 mg/kg/day ) , hydroxychloroquine mycophenolate mofetil ( ≤3000 mg/day ) . 7 . Bcell depletion therapy ( treatment Rituximab ) within 12 month prior first dose study medication . 8 . Potent inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 intravenously orally within 14 day prior first dose study medication . 9 . History myocardial infarction current uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia . 10 . Marked baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval ( eg , repeated demonstration QTc interval &gt; 450 millisecond 11 . History additional risk factor torsade de pointes ( eg , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT syndrome ) 12 . Treatment concomitant medication prolong QT interval . 13 .
