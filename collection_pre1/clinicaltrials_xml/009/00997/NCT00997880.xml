	<brief_title>Statin Atheroma Vulnerability Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , proven drug modality stabilize vulnerable plaque . A number drug beneficial patient coronary disease may act part improve stability plaque vulnerable future rupture . Especially , Lipid-lowering therapy , particularly statin , stabilize vulnerable plaque already rupture improve endothelial function reduce thrombogenicity , platelet aggregation , possibly inflammation . As atherosclerotic disease progress , increase atherosclerotic plaque amount . However , change specific plaque composition within atherosclerotic lesion sufficiently evaluate . Previous pathologic finding report significant relation plaque size necrotic core size.Conventional grey-scale intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) significant limitation accurately assess atheromatous plaque composition . These limitation partially address radiofrequency signal processing spectral analysis back-scattered ultrasound signal . Using technology , Virtual Histology ( VH ) IVUS capable characterize plaque calcify ( white ) , fibrotic ( dark-green ) , fibrofatty ( yellow-green ) , necrotic core ( red ) . In addition , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) light-based image modality use biological system study tissue vivo near-histologic , ultrahigh resolution . The rationale intravascular application OCT potential vivo visualization coronary artery microstructure . This unique image resolution OCT offer potential detect key feature vulnerable plaque vivo . Beyond inherent limitation angioscopy intravascular ultrasound , OCT might offer much high sensitivity detection necrotic/lipid core within coronary atheroma . Therefore , plaque characterization use VH-IVUS OCT may provide detailed morphologic insight plaque vulnerability . We hypothesize statin would provide benefit stabilize coronary plaque composition LDL-reduction and/or pleiotropic effect . We also hypothesize high-dose statin would beneficial reduce vulnerable plaque stabilize vulnerable plaque composition low-dose statin .</detailed_description>
