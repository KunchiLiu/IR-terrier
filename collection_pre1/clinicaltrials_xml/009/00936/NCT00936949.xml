	<brief_title>Posterolateral Surgical Approach Compared With Modified Lateral Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip arthroplasty one successful orthopaedic procedure relieve pain improve quality life . But dislocation remain lead early complication total hip arthroplasty report frequency 0.4 % 11 % . There several risk factor dislocation total hip arthroplasty include patient , implant surgical approach . Among lots risk factor , surgical approach debate one important key factor influence dislocation abductor function . Direct lateral posterolateral surgical approach commonly use total hip arthroplasty . The modified lateral approach generally think low dislocation rate allow excellent acetabular exposure although limping increase . The posterolateral approach may allow maintenance abductor strength generally result high dislocation rate . However , several report posterolateral approach capsular repair might reduce dislocation rate . We hypothesize dislocation rate posterolateral approach capsular repair similar modify lateral approach total hip arthroplasty . A prospective , randomized-controlled study examine null hypothesis dislocation rate posterior approach capsular repair similar modify lateral approach total hip arthroplasty 2 year followup . We attempt determine whether difference surgical parameter , component positioning , clinical result modify lateral approach compare posterolateral approach .</detailed_description>
