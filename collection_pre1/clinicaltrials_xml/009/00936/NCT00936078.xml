	<brief_title>Living Kidney Donor Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplantation prefer treatment option patient kidney failure . Compared dialysis , patient receive transplant substantial reduction risk death , improve quality life , decrease health care cost . The demand kidney result long waiting list decease donor kidney . Therefore , live kidney donation increase year order meet demand kidney . Living donation also add benefit shorter wait time , increase graft success increase recipient survival compare deceased donor transplantation . Aside advantage recipient , live transplantation complex medical practice must conduct safe ethical manner . The premise accept living donor `` minimal '' risk short long-term medical harm realize donor outweigh definite advantage recipient potential psychosocial benefit altruism donor . The short-term potential medical consequence live kidney donor well establish . Yet , long-term implication live kidney donation far less certain . Potential medical risk include hypertension , proteinuria , reduce kidney function , premature cardiovascular disease death . Estimates outcomes vary substantially literature . As well , potential long-term medical risk also communicate inconsistently across transplant community . It accept live donor experience increase self-esteem , feeling well-being improved quality life altruistic act . However , donor negative psychosocial outcome require clarification . There also financial burden donor donation process . Concerns future life , disability medical insurance raise .
