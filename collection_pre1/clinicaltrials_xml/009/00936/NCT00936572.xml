	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The administration probiotic bacteria hypothesize affect composition intestinal microflora reduction pathogens favour non-pathogens . These event might modulate immune inflammatory response , gut function . Experimental data demonstrate modulation mucosal function enteric microflora Lactobacillus plantarum reduces septic morbidity mortality animal . The administration mix probiotic show effective antibiotic cure pouchitis human . Since patient undergoing colorectal operation high risk develop infection due intraoperative contamination enteral content occurence bacterial translocation , change intestinal microflora , give lactobacillus may result important advantage reduce risk intraoperative complication post operative sepsis . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY To evaluate preoperative administration mucosa recondition probiotic may result adherence colonic mucosa change gut microflora , may modulate immune inflammatory response gut function . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS Overall Design Control Methods Prospective , randomize , double-blind study design . Centers Departement Surgery , San Raffaele University , Milan , Italy Departement Surgery , San Gerardo Hospital , University Milano-Bicocca , Italy Number Subjects/assignment Formula Groups In departements 50 patient operated colorectal disease yearly laparoscopic approach . All patient potential candidate partecipate study . It expect least 80 % patient agree partecipation , course study 25 % partecipants expect withdraw . During intake procedure inclusion exclusion criterion check . Eligible patient informed objective , background design study . When patient give consent partecipate study , preoperative status assess . The patient include study population randomly assign one treatment . During surgery intraoperative exclusion criterion check non eligible patient exclude study . Each group consist 15 patient order assure end study 10 patient per group complete study . Groups : A : high dose probiotic ( active ) compare B : low dose probiotic ( control ) C : vehicle ( placebo ) Dosing Regimen ? ? Dosing Scheme : Preoperative day 5 1 . Postoperative day 3 8 . The three preparation give 3 time per day ( 6 hour interval ) . Duration study 6 month SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS Day -6 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 S I I I I I MB MB MB MB MB GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF S = select inform patient I = immunological- inflammatory data MB = microbiological data GF= gastrointestinal function , fecal pH . Immunological- inflammatory data : DHR , lymphocyte subset ( CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , NK ) , IgA serum level , CRP , IL-6 , lactate . Number subset intestinal lymphocyte . In vitro response lymphocytes macropahges mitogen LPS . Microbiological data : Quantitative qualitative culture stool colonic mucosa ( aerobic anaerobic total count , aerobic gram negative positive count ) â€¢ During surgery two mucosal sample collect microscopic ( adherence test ) microbiological evaluation presence probiotic mucosa . Moreover , lymph node mesentery harvest microbiological analysis ass translocation . Intraoperative parameter : Duration surgery , blood loss , transfusion ( amount type ) , abdominal contamination . Gastrointestinal function : Clinical observation relate gastrointestinal symptom defecation pattern Concomitant Medication Treatments All patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis cefotetan 2gr 30 minute surgery ( single shot ) bowel preparation iso osmotic solution enema day surgery . STUDY PARAMETERS Efficacy Primary Efficacy Parameters - morphological microbiological evaluation colonic microflora - gastrointestinal function Secondary Efficacy Parameters - immune inflammatory response - bacterial translocation Adverse event All adverse event encounter study report Case Report Form . An adverse event adverse change baseline , include intercurrent illness , wich occur course study treatment start , whether consider related treatment . Blinding Randomization The three study formula blind towards . Both research patient blind . Randomization patient three group perform computer randomization program `` Random '' . In way patient number assign random group `` active formula '' , `` placebo fromula '' `` control formula . Within three group randomization do block 10 patientnumbers . Per study group three letter use assigned random patientnumbers . The randomization list may break case adverse event . Formulation Packaging The formulation trial formula sachet Dispensing The investigator responsible storage study formulae time study . The sachet must store refrigerated time handout . During actual time patient take study formula refrigeration sachet require . The investigator responsible hand study formula order patientnumber . A dispensary record study formula issue material return keep . Preparation , Administration Dosage test formula Route Before operation supplement consume orally . Administration protocol For 5 preoperative day addition free choice hospital food , surgery day 3 8 . Assessment Compliance The investigator take high care patient comply condition set study , order prevent unnecessary withdrawal non compliance . WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY Subjects right withdraw study time reason . The investigator also right withdraw subject study event intercurrent illness , adverse event , treatment failure prescribed procedure , protocols violation , cure , administrative reason reason . It understand concerned excessive rate withdrawal render study uninterpretable : therefore , unnecessary , withdrawal subject avoid . Should subject decide withdraw , effort make complete report observation thoroughly possible . A complete final evaluation time patient 's withdrawal make explanation subject withdraw study . If reason removal patient study adverse event abnormal laboratory test result , principal specific event test also record Case Report Form . In event emergency patient 's condition require knowledge test treatment , label may open determine nature test formula dispense . ANY BROKEN CODE WILL BE CLEARLY JUSTIFIED AND EXPLAINED BY A COMMENT ON THE CASE REPORT FORM , along data code break . REPLACEMENT POLICY Patients withdraw study replace necessary . CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION OF SUBJECTS ' DATA FROM ANALYSES OF STUDY PARAMETERS - Intra operative exclusion - Extensive evidence non compliance . Hypothesis Testing H0 : Probiotic bacteria affect microbiology gut mucosa stool gastrointestinal function , immunological inflammatory parameter compare control placebo . H1 : Probiotic bacteria significantly diminish number adhrent stool pathogens improve gastrointestinal function and/or immunological parameter and/or inflammatory parameter compare control placebo .</detailed_description>
