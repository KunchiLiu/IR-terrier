	<brief_title>The Enhanced Angiogenic Cell Therapy - Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : - Despite widespread use pharmacological and/or interventional reperfusion therapy , recovery cardiac function myocardial infarction patient often modest case absent . Unlike classical re-perfusion therapy , must deliver irreversible cardiac damage occur , use progenitor cell could potentially restore functional tissue region otherwise would form scar . A number clinical trial perform , mainly use autologous bone marrow cell , suggest significant albeit modest improvement cardiac function post MI . However , major limitation autologous cell therapy patient cardiovascular disease deleterious influence age cardiac risk factor progenitor cell activity , may limit greatly potential efficacy promise approach . Trial Design : - The Enhanced Angiogenic Cell Therapy - Acute Myocardial Infarction ( ENACT-AMI ) trial Canadian , 5-center , phase IIb , double-blind , parallel , randomize placebo control trial assess safety efficacy cell gene therapy patient moderate large anterior STEMI undergone re-vascularization stent implantation infarct relate artery ( IRA ) . The anticipated recruitment target 100 patient two-year period . - Consenting participant qualify screen process , undergo apheresis . Randomization , web-based system take place immediately successful apheresis . The cell collection sample send cell manufacturing facility manufacture accord treatment allocation : ) Placebo ( Plasma-Lyte A &amp; 25 % autologous plasma ) , b ) EPCs c ) EPCs transfected human endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . - Approximately 5-7 day later , patient receive randomize treatment allocation via intracoronary injection IRA . Participants remain hospital overnight continuous cardiac monitoring . The first post-delivery visit take place follow morning hospital discharge . Subsequent study visit clinic visit 1 week , 1 , 3 6 month study treatment . Subsequently , registry collect long-term safety information telephone contact continue annually 10 year . During registry period , participant allow volunteer enrolment clinical trial .</detailed_description>
