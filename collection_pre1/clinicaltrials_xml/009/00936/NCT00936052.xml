	<brief_summary>Standard treatment glioblastoma include radiation chemotherapy drug call temozolomide ( Temodar ) ; however , glioblastomas frequently develop resistance standard treatment recur progress . Glioblastomas know decreased level oxygen compare normal tissue . There evidence low oxygen level glioblastomas may contribute ability resist treatment effect radiation chemotherapy . In study look increase oxygen concentration within glioblastoma add hyperbaric treatment ( experimental part study ) standard treatment radiation temozolomide order see whether increase oxygen concentration within tumor increase tumor-killing ability standard radiation chemotherapy . In addition , investigator interested evaluate effect treatment protocol person 's quality life level stress , , therefore , investigator ask subject complete several brief questionnaire on-study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Hyperoxygenation With Radiotherapy Temozolomide Adults With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All enrol study subject receive treatment . Nobody receive placebo . Before start on-study , investigator require standard blood test ( blood count , chemistry , liver function test , etc ) , urinalysis , serum pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) MRI contrast ( CAT scan unable obtain MRI ) investigator routinely obtain start new treatment chemotherapy . Standard treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma surgery begin six week combine radiation ( Monday-Friday ) chemotherapy oral drug call temozolomide ( Temodar ) patient normally take home daily ( include weekend ) six week . Patients four week treatment . After four week , patient resume take temozolomide monthly basis . During phase treatment , patient take high dose temozolomide five day every twenty eight day ( take drug first five day every 28 day cycle remain 23 day drug ) . Patients continue take temozolomide monthly basis tumor progression , complete six twelve month treatment unable tolerate drug longer due side effect . Temozolomide typically take daily empty stomach one-half hour take anti-nausea medication also prescribe physician . Patients take temozolomide also instruct take lactulose need constipation . During initial six week combine radiation chemotherapy , patient also take antibiotic protect specific type pneumonia commonly occur people weaken immune system ( pneumocystis carinii ) . Following completion combine phase radiation chemotherapy , continuation antibiotic depend upon discretion treat physician . In study , addition standard radiation chemotherapy describe , patient also receive experimental hyperbaric treatment prior radiation treatment ( Monday-Friday ) initial six week treatment . Prior first hyperbaric treatment , patient need chest x-ray perform make certain preexisting abnormal air space chest lung could worsen hyperbaric treatment . The hyperbaric treatment last approximately thirty minute . During hyperbaric treatment , patient lie stretcher hyperbaric chamber breathe oxygen great normal atmospheric pressure . The investigator monitor increase oxygen level tissue place noninvasive electrode skin . After hyperbaric treatment , investigator measure participant blood sugar finger-stick check hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) . If detect , hypoglycemia treat standard medical measure . Blood test obtain per routine standard care ( weekly initial six week combine radiation chemotherapy ) day # 21 28 ( +/- 2 day ) cycle monthly temozolomide.After initial MRI ( CAT scan ) , subsequent MRI 's ( CAT scan ) obtain per standard care : four week completion radiation generally every two cycle chemotherapy unless medically indicated time point . Other scan PET scan may obtain medically indicate per standard care . This study also look evaluate effect treatment regimen quality life patient level stress . Therefore , investigator ask patient complete three brief questionnaires several different time point : starting study , follow-up visit three four week completion radiation , completion every two cycle monthly temozolomide come study ( possible . ) The patient remain study completion one year treatment , patient may voluntarily elect withdraw study , patient tolerate treatment side effect prevent continue study evidence tumor progression .</detailed_description>
