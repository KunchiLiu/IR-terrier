	<brief_title>Using Sitagliptin Treatment Prevent New Onset Diabetes After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New-onset diabetes transplantation ( NODAT ) complication solid organ transplantation . In UNMC Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Clinic , frequency complication exceed 50 % kidney transplant recipient without diabetes prior transplantation . NODAT associate increased morbidity mortality . As complication appear occur rather soon transplantation , potential preventative strategy need institute soon transplantation . Although traditional risk factor , family history , obesity , minority status , explain additional risk , think immunosuppressive agent responsible increase risk NODAT . The immunosuppressive agent need prevent rejection , leave consider additional strategy prevent onset NODAT . We propose conduct pilot study utilize dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor , sitagliptin , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study consecutive kidney transplant recipient University Nebraska Medical Center . We test sitagliptin patient type 2 diabetes receive kidney transplant show major side effect alteration immunosuppressive drug level . This agent FDA-approved treatment type 2 diabetes , low rate hypoglycemia . It think work inhibit enzyme naturally break glucagons-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , thus increase endogenous level GLP-1 . GLP-1 inhibits glucagon stimulatory effect beta cell function . Although current study treat non-diabetic patient hope NODAT delayed prevent , incretin-based therapy think low risk hypoglycemia side effect . In addition , safely use low-GFR condition . The study attempt recruit 40 subject ( 20 sitagliptin 20 control subject ) . Patients initiate placebo control 2 week transplantation . Subjects follow UNMC Transplant Clinic . Initially , patient see weekly later follow every three month 1 year . The primary outcome development NODAT base 2003 Consensus International Guidelines . Fasting glucose level follow accord usual post-transplant monitoring test frequently weekly recent post-transplant period eventually go least monthly . Secondary outcome include HbA1c value obtain baseline every three month . In addition , follow side effect , include hypoglycemia . The study local DSMB . Consent obtain prior transplantation .</detailed_description>
