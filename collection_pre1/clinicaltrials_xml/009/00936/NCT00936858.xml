	<brief_summary>Since thyroid cancer become refractory radioactive iodine , treatment option limit . Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib recently show promise . This trial seek expand treatment option disease new , oral drug call RAD001 . It inhibitor mTOR pathway show activity neuroendocrine cancer gastrointestinal tract approve treatment metastatic renal cell cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Patients With Radioiodine Refractory Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- RAD001 take day morning start Day 1 continue participant longer participate study treatment . - A history physical exam perform first day study month . Blood test include coagulation study , thyroid study perform monthly . A urine sample need provide first day treatment every 2 month . Imaging consist CT MRI neck , chest abdomen do every 8 week start RAD001 . - Participants remain research study 24 month . However , participant doctor feel benefit study drug severe side effect , may give option continue take RAD001 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm locally advanced metastatic thyroid cancer , exclude thyroid lymphoma amenable refractory surgical resection , external beam radiotherapy , radioiodine local therapy . Prior therapy chemotherapy target therapy except mTor inhibitor allow . Medullary thyroid cancer document evidence disease progression modify RECIST within 6 month study day 1 symptomatic disease time screen absence document disease progression . Differentiated thyroid cancer document evidence disease progression modify RECIST within 6 month study day 1 . Anaplastic thyroid cancer disease progression document disease progression modify RECIST within 6 month study day 1 . Patients must least one measurable site disease accord RECIST criterion previously irradiate . If patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence progression since radiation . 18 year age older WHO performance status 2 less Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function Fasting serum cholesterol 300mg/dL less OR 7.75 mmol/L less AND fast triglyceride 2.5x ULN less Patients receive anticancer therapy within last 2 week receive radiation therapy within 3 week study day 1 Prior therapy mTOR inhibitor Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 3 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within 2 week study entry study period Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control methods Patients receive prior treatment wih mTOR inhibitor Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 rapamycins excipients History noncompliance medical regimen</criteria>
