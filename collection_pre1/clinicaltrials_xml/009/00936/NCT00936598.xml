	<detailed_description>Despite continue improvement surgical procedure ancillary care , post surgery pain continue nearly universal patient experience follow major operative procedure . Opioids provide considerable pain relief , multiple adverse side effect entirely effective . For cancer patient , uncontrolled postoperative pain substantial negative effect quality life , slow recovery , increase likelihood complication , contribute poor postoperative outcome . The identification novel modifiable patient risk factor post surgery pain could become target presurgery intervention thus important goal . We conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind intervention trial design evaluate effect FDA approve hypnotic ( zolpidem ) post surgery pain . Since presurgery psychological factor ( e.g. , heighten anxiety ) know predict severity post surgical pain may associate poor sleep , also assess psychological factor ( questionnaire ) well sleep ( use actigraphy ) order determine individual combine impact woman 's experience post surgery pain stressful clinical context . Aim 1 : To determine impact zolpidem administer night prior endometrial cancer surgery woman 's experience pain initial 7-10 day follow-up period surgery use double-blind placebo-controlled design ( final n=128 ) . Aim 2 : To investigate psychological factor morning surgery , well objective sleep variable night surgery , possible mediator beneficial effect zolpidem post surgery pain . Aim 3 : To examine psychological factor , well sleep variable , assess prior sleep intervention possible moderator ameliorative effect zolpidem post surgery pain . The result propose exploratory study would provide preliminary data necessary R01 application support comprehensive investigation , include exploration biological mechanism underlie preventative effect well presurgery sleep patient ' experience post surgery pain .</detailed_description>
