	<brief_summary>This partially randomized clinical trial study short-term fast reduce side effect patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin advance solid tumor . Short-term fasting chemotherapy may reduce side effect cause chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-Term Fasting : Impact Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility short-term fasting prior administration combination chemotherapy platinum patient advance solid tumor malignancy . II . To evaluate toxicity profile platinum-based chemotherapy subject eat normally compare undertake short-term starvation . III . To investigate change plasma insulin , glucose , IGF1 IGF bind protein ( IGFBP ) level , oxidative stress marker subject undertake short-term fasting compare control . IV . To investigate whether change grp78 expression occur fast chemotherapy administration human subject . OUTLINE : STAGE I : Patients assign 1 4 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients fast 24 hour day-1 . GROUP II : Patients fast 48 hour day -2 -1 . GROUP III : Patients fast 72 hour day -3 , -2 , and-1 . GROUP IV : Patients undergo modify 48-hour fast minimal caloric intake day -2 -1 . STAGE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients fast 72 hour day -2 , day 1 . ARM II : Patients proceed chemotherapy without fast . All patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1 8 cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Histologically confirm malignancy platinumbased chemotherapy 21 day cycle 14 day cycle recommend . Disease state : Stage I trial : newly diagnose disease neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy plan curative setting , metastatic disease . Stage II trial : Measurable disease RECIST criterion must present subject randomize component trial surgery radiation plan , target lesion may treat assessment effect chemotherapy . Prior chemotherapy Stage I : subject may already receive 2 cycle platinumbased chemotherapy , receive prior chemotherapy regimen exception patient metastatic disease receive neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy complete &gt; 6 month prior enrollment . Stage II : subject must receive prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease , 2 cycle current platinum chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . They may receive prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy , provide therapy complete &gt; 6 month prior enrollment . Prior Radiotherapy allow , provide least 2 week elapse completion radiotherapy initiation protocol treatment . BMI &gt; 18.5 ECOG performance status 01 Adequate renal function ( Creatinine &lt; 1.25 ULIN calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ) Premenopausal woman must negative pregnancy test must agree use barrier contraception throughout study period . Diabetes Mellitus Recent significant unexplained weight loss investigator feel may pose unacceptable risk enrollment . Candidates overweight lose weight intentionally via diet exercise exclude . Peripheral Neuropathy &gt; grade 1 History significant cardiac disease , particularly uncompensated congestive heart failure NYHA grade 2 LVEF &lt; 40 % prior assessment . ( Assessment LVEF prior therapy require absence clinical indicator heart disease ) . Patients prior LVEF &lt; 40 % require reevaluation prior study entry . Subjects medication may safely stop fast portion study , may safely consume without food . A history syncope calorie restriction past medical comorbidity , would make fast potentially dangerous .</criteria>
