	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well carboplatin give together paclitaxel everolimus work treat patient previously untreated cancer unknown primary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Paclitaxel , Everolimus Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Cancer Unknown Primary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate response rate patient previously untreated cancer unknown primary treat combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , everolimus . Secondary - Assess time progression , overall survival , duration response , time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - Determine adverse event regimen patient . - Perform descriptive correlative study determine response specific tumor type , identify Origin-FFPE test , regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oral everolimus daily day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ' tumor tissue sample recent biopsy analyze correlative study , include gene expression profile Origin-FFPE test . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month disease progression , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
