	<detailed_description>This descriptive study intestinal failure patient catheter-related blood stream infection ( CRBSI ) fungal organism . At present , recommendation Infectious Disease Society America ( IDSA ) remove catheter fungal infection treat systemically 14 day last positive culture ( 2 ) . However , intestinal failure patient limited IV access , removal line infect Candida albicans , although recommend , might significantly reduce intravenous access create life threaten situation . Thus , purpose study evaluate use antifungal lock therapy liposomal amphotericin B ( Ambisome ) combination systemic antifungal therapy patient fungal CRBSI , whose catheter remove continue critical need central line access . The research method follow : 1 . Study patient consist in-patients hospitalize Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh . From intestinal failure patient follow GI , Transplant , Pediatric Surgical Services , plan enroll 25 patient . In addition , patient similar concern regard limited central venous access catheter-related candidal bloodstream infection may also consider protocol . 2 . The primary group potential patient study patient intestinal insufficiency , include post-op small bowel recipient , whose intravenous access limit . Thus , fungal CRBSI suspect , retention CVC highly desirable . Additional subject potentially eligible study would include child cancer , status-post bone marrow transplant , etc . limited central venous access document catheter-related bloodstream infection secondary candida . 3 . Once fungal infection establish , patient approach participate study . The investigator ( ) fully explain study benefit risk patient and/or parent guardian ( legally appoint research ) consent assent obtain . 4 . Upon enrollment , antifungal therapy institute consist systemic antifungal lock therapy . A. Ambisome dose 3-5 mg/kg/day ( appropriate antifungal base upon standard care ) administer intravenously B. Antifungal lock therapy Ambisome administer . It consist place 2.3 ml ( base upon specific catheter type volume ) concentrate Ambisome infect CVC allow dwell uninterruptedly 8 12 hour per day . The concentration Ambisome 2 mg/ml sterile water ( 4 ) . 5 . Patients enrol study receive routine clinical care in-patients CHP monitor appropriately infectious disease perspective include daily blood culture . Patients examine clinically evidence fungal-related complication ( e.g. , septic arthritis , endocarditis , etc. ) . 6 . The duration antifungal lock therapy ( addition IV systemic antifungal therapy ) 10-14 day . 7 . After 5 day antifungal lock therapy , patient persistently positive fungal blood culture deem failure antifungal lock therapy discontinue . There antifungal lock therapy permissible via protocol data collection patient complete soon possible . The primary service responsible removal line . 8 . With successful lock therapy , additional blood culture catheter obtain day 5 day 30 ( later subject still systemic antifungal agent ) post antifungal lock test cure . - If patient recurrence fungal infection culture day 5 day 30 post antifungal lock , pulse field gel electrophoresis perform original new isolate determine fungal organism . - If organism base upon electrophoretic analysis , treatment deem failure - If organism , another source infection investigate . 9 . Since standard care would remove CVC , primary end point study number percent patient successfully receive antifungal lock therapy , i.e. , patient least 2 negative fungal culture completion 5 day antifungal lock therapy whose CVCs remove . Secondary endpoint include number day culture become negative ; development fungal-related complication ( e.g. , septic arthritis , endocarditis , etc . ) ; development recurrent candidemia day 5 day 30 post antifungal lock therapy . 10 . When medically appropriate , subject may discharge complete Ambisome® lock therapy home . Instructions/training administer lock therapy provide parent , guardian , subject contact research coordinator maintain patient home . 11 . A patient registry establish offer subject central line fungal infection treat Ambisome® lock .</detailed_description>
