	<brief_summary>It demonstrate clearly Western Cambodia parasitological response artesunate artemether contain treatment regimen uncomplicated falciparum malaria slow elsewhere world . Median parasite clearance time ( PCT ) patient treat artesunate 4 mg/kg/day 78 hour 2 mg/kg/day 82 hour , compare 54 48 hour , respectively , Western Thailand ; 72hours peripheral blood parasitaemia still detectable 55 % patient Western Cambodia , compare 7.5 % Western Thailand . Although occasional poor response artesunate describe previously current report suggest consistent problem . These antimalarial central current treatment strategy , spread parasite reduce artemisinin susceptibility outside area would disaster . A recent consensus meeting Pnomh Penh agree indeed term resistance , represent major threat malaria control . Radical containment measure would need . This study aim address whether semi-synthetic fully synthetic peroxide antimalarial would effective artesunate could therefore use Cambodia part elimination strategy . Artemisone semisynthetic derivative dihydroartemisinin , importantly change tertiary structure . This drug also show promising efficacy treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria phase II trial Thailand seem least efficacious artesunate . No significant toxicity report artemisone well tolerate . If sensitivity artemisone remain intact Western Cambodia , important implication strategy available containment threaten problem artesunate resistance Western Cambodia . It also important implication development drug use artemisinin combination therapy ( ACTs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This small detailed randomise open-label clinical trial compare efficacy oral artemisone oral artesunate treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria Western Cambodia . A detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation vitro sensitivity study drug part assessment . The overall design propose conduct similar recently complete study high dose artesunate.Fever patient village surround Pailin ( equivalent study site ) Western Cambodia screen PfHRP2-based malaria rapid test ( Paracheck ) village malaria worker . In case positive test result , patient transport study team hospital , full consent ( describe ) enrolment procedure conduct . It make clear outset refusal participate way jeopardize subsequent antimalarial treatment.Eligibility confirm medically qualified investigator . Subjects fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion randomise one three treatment arm accord randomisation schedule .
