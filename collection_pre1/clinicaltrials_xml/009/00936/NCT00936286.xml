	<brief_title>Respiratory Muscle Training Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) great significance affect individual well public health service . Patients suffer reduce quality life show increase accident risk road traffic job . Furthermore , OSAS represent independent risk factor cardiovascular disease , particular arterial hypertension . In sleep apnea patient , relatively early stimulation upper respiratory tract muscle compare thoracic respiratory muscle abrogate many case . Alternatively , nerve damage impair sensory function pharynx area impair motor function upper air tract musculature , particular musculus genioglossus observe . The disturbed sensory function impairs reflex activation genioglossus . Moreover , pattern neurogenic muscle damage loss pattern different type fiber change point adjoin atrophic hypertrophic section monotonous appearance fiber type could detect . During waking hour activity musculus genioglossus enhance compare control person , interpret compensatory mechanism . During sleep time , however , compensation seem disappear . In several study either direct indirect stimulation musculus genioglossus supply nerve deploy . Yet , result inconsistent . The direct muscle stimulation use intramuscular electrode , although efficient , long pursue due technical reason . Although result external stimulation show improvement regard apneas snoring , finding usually weakly pronounce . In study ascertain muscle training transcutaneous electrical stimulation significant improvement regard snore achieve compare placebo . In general , influence sleep apnea syndrome could accomplish , although individual case show clinically relevant amelioration . A precede study compare habitual snorer control person . It show respiratory muscle training mean normocapnic hyperpnea accompany enlargement musculus genioglossus reduce snore . Moreover , increase physical performance observe . Thus , question arises train respiratory musculature mean normocapnic hyperpnea lead clinical polysomnographical improvement patient mild intermediate sleep apnea syndrome .</detailed_description>
