	<brief_title>Traditional ( Traditional Chemoembolization ) TACE Versus Microsphere TACE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one frequent malignancy man . Liver transplantation , surgical resection percutaneous ablation ( alcoholization thermal ablation ) curative therapy use patient present early phase disease , whereas 50-70 % HCC diagnose make disease already reach intermediate-advanced phase . For HCC potentially curative therapy longer possible , palliative treatment propose hepatic intra-arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) consist infusion cisplatin doxorubicin emulsify lipiodol , follow transient flow blockage achieve reabsorbable particle ( gelatin sponge particle ) . The rationale intra-arterial administration chemotherapy agent association embolization material lie presence double hepatic vascularization : hepatocytes mainly vascularize portal structure ( approximately 90 % ) whereas malignant cell vascularize arterial structure ( approximately 90 % ) . Prospective non-randomized retrospective study show TACE capable increase survival ( 60-88 % one year , 30-60 % 2 year 18-50 % 3 year ) versus control . Despite encouraging result , none first six RCT study investigate TACE show significant increase survival decrease tumor dimension . These trial however include mainly large tumor , patient severe liver disease , condition may well mask benefit offer TACE . In 2002 first result two RCTs publish conduct unresectable HCC patient , design assess impact producted TACE survival , demonstrate statistically significant advantage TACE-treated patient compare control : survival 1 , 2 , 3 year 82 % , 63 % , 29 % , respectively , TACE arm versus 63 % , 27 % , 17 % , respectively , control group Llovet study , survival 1 , 2 , 3 year 57 % , 31 % , 26 % , respectively , TACE arm versus 32 % , 11 % , 3 % , respectively , control group study conduct Lo . Both study confirm TACE safe procedure , low complication rate incidence liver failure increase significant percentage TACE-treated group . A recent , systematic meta-analysis conduct 14 trial publish literature , appropriately choose compare effect survival exert TACE compare conservative treatment tamoxifen confirm aforesaid finding . The limitation TACE represent however difficulty obtain complete necrosis lesion treat , reason new embolization agent develop increase therapeutic efficacy chemoembolization HCC . Such newly develop material include increasingly interesting expansible , high biocompatibility microspheres poly ( vinyl alcohol co-acrylic acid ) follow novel feature capable enhance anticancer effect : 1 ) reabsorbable , induce permanent embolization ; 2 ) deformable adapt morphology vessel embolized , selectively target cancerous arterial capillary : 3 ) deliver great quantity chemotherapy agent , minimize systemic effect thereof . The first experimental study use microspheres HCC patient show therapy well tolerated cause higher rate necrosis compare standard TACE , today , RCTs conduct investigate impact survival . STUDY PLAN - Study design : This multicentre , randomize , open-label , active-controlled study HCC patient treat standard chemoembolization versus chemoembolization doxorubicin-loaded microspheres . The study comprise selection phase , treatment period follow-up period , total duration 2 year randomization . During screen phase laboratory test diagnostic imaging ( Ultrasound/CAT scan/MRI ) perform ( indicated inclusion criterion ) . - Study population : The study population compose 214 inpatient present HCC , 107 per randomization arm . TREATMENTS - Study treatment : Both arm receive chemotherapy ( epirubicin doxorubicin ) via hepatic intra-arterial delivery + intra-arterial chemoembolization study arterial branch treat Arm A : chemoembolization standard technique : epirubicin ( maximum dose 75 mg ) conjugate oil-based contrast medium ( Lipiodol ) maximum dose 15 ml + gelatin sponge particle ( particle transient embolization material , require obstruct treated vessel ) Arm B : chemoembolization microspheres : doxorubicin ( maximum dose 75 mg x vial microspheres ) load non-reabsorbable microspheres ( sulfate hydrosphere ) dose 2 ml per vial ( definitive embolization ) . The chemotherapy agent release 14-day period , concentration peak tumor 72 hour treatment , tumor concentration 100-fold achieved traditional intra-arterial injection . Half life drug 10 time longer traditional TACE , systemic concentration drug 100 time less observed standard TACE . As rule procedure perform per HCC lesion treat , since microspheres exert definitive chemoembolization action ; repeat treatment nodule possible whem presence partial persistence vascularization observe imaging assessment follow-up . - Assignment treatment : At visit 1 , unique alphanumeric identification code assign eligible patient .
