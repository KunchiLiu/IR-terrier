	<brief_summary>Alcohol one commonly abuse drug world . Up 40 % medical surgical patient alcohol related problem , alcohol use account 10 % U.S. health care cost . In intensive care unit ( ICU ) , patient history alcohol abuse common rate mortality ICU-related morbidity significantly high compare patient without history alcohol abuse . Though ICU patient heterogeneous group , Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) , devastate form acute lung injury , one frequent diagnose among critically ill patient . In 1996 , make novel observation prior history chronic alcohol abuse associate increase incidence severity ARDS critically ill patient . In epidemiological study 570 critically ill patient , 50 % patient ARDS significant history chronic alcohol abuse . Since ARDS affect approximately 150,000 patient per year United States , mortality 40-50 % even previously healthy individual , alcohol-related ARDS enormous national health care problem . We estimate 15,000 25,000 death per year United States associate alcohol-related ARDS , number consistent even exceed number death due many alcohol-related disease cirrhosis liver alcohol-related traffic accident . Further investigation association chronic alcohol abuse ARDS need develop therapy improve morbidity mortality important patient population . The clinical syndrome ARDS define refractory hypoxemia bilateral infiltrates chest radiograph absence leave atrial hypertension . Pathophysiologically , ARDS characterize diffuse alveolar damage , increase pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability , subsequent accumulation extravascular lung water . In animal model chronic alcohol abuse , show chronic ethanol ingestion cause chronic oxidative stress , deplete lung glutathione , impair alveolar-capillary barrier function , exaggerate endotoxin-mediated acute lung injury . Ethanol-mediated disruption alveolar-capillary barrier , associate susceptibility acute edematous injury , modify glutathione ( GSH ) replacement therapy animal model . Responding NIH emphasis study mechanisms disease evaluation therapy human subject , group initiate translational study expand basic observation effect chronic alcohol abuse ARDS clinical setting . We recently report lung epithelial lining fluid individual prior history chronic alcohol abuse deficient GSH , essential antioxidant . The translational experiment outline proposal identify alteration structure function lung individual history chronic alcohol abuse test novel medical therapy may ultimately decrease morbidity mortality 50,000-75,000 ARDS patient prior history chronic alcohol abuse per year United States . We propose follow hypothesis antioxidant deficiency cause abnormal alveolar-capillary barrier function individual history chronic alcohol abuse , oral anti-oxidant replacement therapy correct abnormality . If hypothesis confirm , work would pave way test antioxidant replacement prophylaxis acute lung injury alcoholic patient risk development ARDS . Specific Aim : To determine safety efficacy vivo antioxidant replacement therapy alveolar-capillary barrier function individual history chronic alcohol abuse .</brief_summary>
