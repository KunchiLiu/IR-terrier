	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , include stroke , number one killer United States.Each year 700,000 people experience new recurrent stroke , translate one stroke every 45 second . Apart traditional risk factor stroke hypertension , smoke atrial fibrillation , obstructive sleep apnea increasingly recognize another important treatable risk factor . The majority stroke myocardial infarction due atherothrombotic event . Impaired fibrinolytic activity increase propensity thromboembolic event . Many different candidate molecule study cause hypercoagulable state . Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) major physiologic inhibitor body 's fibrinolytic system include principal serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . It therefore poise pivotal regulator fibrinolytic system.Recent study show PAI-1 level elevate patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) PAI-1 level correlate severity OSA . The purpose pilot study twofold : - To characterize change blood level plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) tissue type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) across 24 hour cycle patient obstructive sleep apnea , compare normal control , identify pattern change vary severity obstructive sleep apnea , - To study endothelial function patient obstructive sleep apnea , compare normal control . Data gather pilot study use initiate comprehensive prospective study explore link OSA , endothelial function , fibrinolytic system cardiovascular event . This area explore prospectively follow patient assess reduction event treatment OSA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old . Subjects able willing provide inform consent . Subjects willing cooperate polysomnography serial blood draw 24hour period . Evidence OSA ( AHI &gt; 5 events/hour ) without treatment suspect OSA base symptom patient group . Body mass index 2545 History myocardial infarction , stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) peripheral vascular disease . History chronic disease diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled hypertension ( SBP &gt; 160 , DBP &gt; 120 ) , renal failure dialysis , cancer , autoimmune liver disease . A significant history medical psychiatric disease may impair participation trial . Evidence medical instability ( cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , pulmonary disease ) require expedited evaluation treatment OSA . History alcohol , drug abuse oneyearperiod prior trial participation . Current use tobacco product . Current treatment angiotensin convert enzymeinhibitors chronic use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent . Another primary sleep disorder require intervention medication cause disrupt sleep . Patients unusual sleep wake habit , include shift work . Transmeridian travel previous 3 month . Patients OSA already receive treatment CPAP , surgery oral appliance . Pregnancy ; hormonal change affect sleep disorder breathing .</criteria>
