	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine change regional fluoride incorporation , measure 18F-fluoride PET ( SUV Ki ) , occur castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases normal bone response treatment dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine change 18F-fluoride transport ( K1 ) , indicator blood flow , therefore , indirect marker angiogenesis , occur castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases normal bone response treatment dasatinib . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET scan baseline 12 week initiation treatment dasatinib . PET parameter ( SUV , Ki , Kl ) also analyze .</detailed_description>
