	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Androgen-deprivation therapy may lessen amount androgen make body . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without androgen-deprivation therapy treat patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work compare radiation therapy give together androgen-deprivation therapy treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Androgen-Deprivation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Demonstrate overall survival ( OS ) advantage patient intermediate-risk prostate cancer treat dose-escalated radiotherapy ( RT ) versus without short-term androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Secondary - Determine whether addition ADT dose-escalated RT versus RT alone improve clinical failure , biochemical failure `` nadir +2 '' , freedom failure , rate salvage ADT , prostate cancer-specific mortality patient . - Estimate magnitude benefit ADT respect OS patient treat different RT modality ( i.e. , external-beam radiation therapy alone vs low-dose rate brachytherapy boost v high-dose rate brachytherapy boost ) . - Compare acute late treatment adverse event regimens correlate event presence absence pre-existing comorbidity document Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 assessment . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study radiotherapy . Patients stratify accord number risk factor ( 1 vs 2-3 ) , comorbidity ( ACE-27 grade ≥ 2 v &lt; 2 ) , radiotherapy ( RT ) modality ( dose-escalated external-beam RT [ EBRT ] v EBRT low-dose rate brachytherapy boost v EBRT high-dose rate brachytherapy boost ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo EBRT* daily day 1-5 9 week ( 44 treatment ) . Some patient instead receive EBRT high-dose rate low-dose rate brachytherapy implant day 1-5 5 week ( 25 treatment ) . NOTE : *Type RT discretion treat physician may include either 3D-conformal RT intensity-modulated RT . - Arm II : Patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy comprise luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( leuprolide , goserelin , buserelin , triptorelin ) subcutaneously injection every 1 3 month AND oral antiandrogen therapy ( flutamide 3 time daily bicalutamide daily ) 6 month . Beginning 8 week first LHRH injection , patient undergo radiotherapy arm I . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
