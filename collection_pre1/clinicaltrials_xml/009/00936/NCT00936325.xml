	<brief_summary>Background : - Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome ( SCLS ) disorder unknown cause characterize episode life-threatening drop blood pressure leakage fluid tissue . The outcome episode SCLS may mild resolve , may severe result death . Although SCLS likely involve abnormality cell line blood vessel , specific cause ( ) disorder know . - The treatment choice acute SCLS episode intravenous fluid drug norepinephrine ( adrenaline ) , give keep blood pressure level maintain vital organ function . This may follow course intravenous steroid IVIG . Currently , cure , IVIG effective diminishing frequency and/or intensity SCLS episodes give regularly , long-term effective preventive therapy many patient experience recurrent episode SCLS . - This protocol focus understanding cause SCLS hope research finding lead design safe effective treatment . Objectives : - To investigate mechanism may cause Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome . Eligibility : - Patients 16 old diagnose SCLS . Patients diagnose SCLS age 7 16 may participate off-site , send specimen NIH . Patients 16 old diagnose SCLS travel NIH may also participate off-site . - Patients must document history least one episode SCLS three follow document least one occasion : low blood volume , low blood pressure without cause , evidence protein leakage episode . A letter referral treating physician also require . Design : - Patients see site evaluate National Institutes Health ( NIH ) approximately 4 5 day inpatient basis , undergo follow procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Blood sample evaluation research purpose , well possible genetic testing . - Apheresis procedure , need , obtain large volume blood cell research . - Bone marrow biopsy , medically indicate . - Other medically indicated test , skin test check possible allergic reaction . - Patients capillary leak episode NIH treat standard care treat SCLS . - Patients discharge protocol 1 year NIH visit . - Patients participate off-site asked collect send specimen ( blood ) NIH research purpose evaluation . - Unaffected Biological relative SCLS patient Unrelated Normal Volunteers may also enroll study . Relatives Normal Volunteers may ask provide research sample study , skin biopsy research blood specimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The systemic capillary leak syndrome ( SCLS , Clarkson syndrome ) exceedingly rare disorder unknown cause characterize chronic edema acute transient , severe episode hypotension , hypovolemia , oliguria . Severe edema result leakage fluid macromolecule ( 200-900 kDa ) tissue . Acute SCLS episodes carry high morbidity mortality ( 25-30 % ) . Only 150 case report worldwide since 1960 , although disease may underdiagnosed due nonspecific nature present sign symptom considerable overlap shock syndrome include sepsis , anaphylaxis , angioedema . Approximately 85 % individual monoclonal gammopathy unknown significance ( MGUS ) , relationship find disease pathogenesis unclear . This protocol focus pathogenesis SCLS . Subjects document episode capillary leak evaluate order correlate clinical laboratory feature typical SCLS . The goal identify biological factor and/or genetic molecular event may predispose SCLS episode . We plan enroll 210 subject , family member healthy volunteer study . We anticipate finding may first step toward development new targeted therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects SCLS UNDER16 year age eligible component protocol occur Off Site send NIH . All subject must least 16 year old participate aspect protocol . Diagnosis suspect diagnosis Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome physician document history capillary leak characterize one following : 1 . Hypotension ( systolic blood pressure typically less 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure le 60 mm Hg ) associate symptoms hypotension ( e.g. , hypotonia [ collapse ] , lightheadedness syncope , incontinence , increase thirst ) 2 . Laboratory evidence hemoconcentration ( e.g. , hemoglobin level normal range [ typically great than17 g/dL ] , elevate leukocyte count ) . 3 . Clinical evidence fluid extravasation ( e.g . edema ) and/or laboratory evidence protein extravasation serum hypoalbuminemia ( le 3.5 g/dL ) either chronically acute hypotensive episode . Letter referral , copy pertinent medical history laboratory study , prospective study subject refer physician . Patients may selfrefer , letter referral primary physician still require . Ability give inform consent , parent guardian able give inform consent . A Medical/Legal Guardian Legally Authorized Representative may give consent incapacitate adult SCLS subject . Willing donate blood sample storage use future research . PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SUBJECT 'S RELATIVES/HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Willing donate blood sample storage use future research . Subjects must least 16 year old . Able give inform consent . PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Presence condition judgment investigator refer physician may put subject undue risk travel ( include frequent episode severe capillary leak , symptom preventable premedication , acute infection , severe thrombocytopenia [ minimum platelet count 30,000/microL ] , significant cardiovascular disease ) Any condition view principal investigator would make subject unsuitable enrollment study There identify cause hypotensive episode and/or tissue swell . Subjects age 16 eligible component protocol occur Off Site mail NIH , collection research sample . Subjects age 16 otherwise excluded component protocol . PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SUBJECT 'S RELATIVES/HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Presence condition judgment investigator may put subject undue risk Any condition view principal investigator would make subject unsuitable enrollment study PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN : No relative healthy volunteer age 16 enrol . However , child ( age &lt; 16 year ) SCLS may participate component protocol occur Off Site mail NIH , collect research specimens local care provider send sample NIH . Due lifethreatening nature SCLS episode , intensive care management may require . The NIH clinical center pediatric intensive care unit facility . In addition , prevalence SCLS child extremely low . PARTICIPATION OF ADULT SUBJECTS UNABLE TO CONSENT : Adult subject unable provide consent acute episode SCLS may include study . Specimens acute phase SCLS episode timesensitive , may yield critical information regard potential causative factor acute cellular abnormality correlate clinical feature SCLS . Due lifethreatening nature SCLS episode , subject may suddenly require intensive care management subject local institution , render subject unable provide his/her consent . While incapacitated , Medical/Legal Guardian Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) may provide Off Site consent collection timesensitive , critical specimen . An NIAID staff member able obtain consent protocol may obtain consent Medical/Legal Guardian LAR . Although may direct benefit subject , research blood specimen may obtain minimal risk , tissue sample obtain described section 4.1.6 . Once acute phase resolve , subject able give his/her consent , previously incapacitate adult may reconsented .</criteria>
