	<brief_summary>Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) respiratory disease commonly require protease inhibitor ( PIs ) orally inhaled corticosteroid . Inhaled corticosteroid alone generally cause systemic adverse effect low systemic bioavailability , combination inhale fluticasone various PIs lead increase systemic fluticasone level multiple case secondary adrenal insufficiency . A study healthy volunteer show &gt; 350-fold increase fluticasone area curve ritonavir ( RTV ) 100mg twice daily coadministered intranasal fluticasone compare intranasal fluticasone alone . The mechanism drug interaction presumably secondary PI inhibition cytochrome P450 3A4 , enzyme responsible fluticasone metabolism . As result , inhale fluticasone recommend combination PIs unless benefit outweighs risk . One possible alternative fluticasone inhale beclomethasone , study combination PIs .

Furthermore , pharmacokinetic property beclomethasone-17-monopropionate , relatively short half-life , low maximum plasma concentration , low volume distribution , suggest systemic accumulation lead significant adverse effect unlikely even presence CYP3A4 inhibitor PI . In open-label study , 46 subject receive inhale beclomethasone 6 week Days 1 42 . Subjects randomize 1 3 group , Days 15 42 , 18 subject add additional study drug , 14 subject add RTV 100mg twice daily , 14 subject add DRV/r 600/100mg twice daily .

Data investigation determine whether RTV and/or DRV/r , potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor , alter pharmacokinetics beclomethasone active metabolite , beclomethasone-17-monopropionate ( primary objective ) , whether possible increase systemic bioavailability beclomethasone beclomethasone-17-monopropionate alters pre-cosyntropin cortisol level responses ACTH stimulation test 4-week period ( secondary objective ) .
