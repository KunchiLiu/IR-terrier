	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , systematically evaluate therapeutic effect citicoline , may increase dopamine normalize cognitive structural deficit brain methamphetamine dependent subject . Methamphetamine dependent subject undergo baseline repeat cognitive assessment 8-9 week placebo oral citicoline nutritional supplement . We also evaluate chemical structural change brain region identify magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , diffusion tension imaging ( DTI ) cortical thickness , turn expect recover 8-9 week citicoline treatment . Specific brain region interest include prefrontal cortex , temporal cortex , caudate/putamen know involved pathophysiology methamphetamine dependence .</detailed_description>
