	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label study Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody treatment 1st 2nd relapsed indolent B cell lymphoma B cell lymphoma transform aggressive histology . The primary endpoint study determine response rate . Secondary endpoint study determine duration response , time progression , time-to-treatment failure , safety , survival . Forty patient receive therapy study 2 clinical site . Patients undergo 2 phase study . In first phase , term `` dosimetric dose '' , patient receive infusion unlabeled Anti B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) 70 minute ( include 10 minute flush ) immediately follow 30 minute infusion ( include 10 minute flush ) Anti B1 Antibody ( 35 mg ) trace-labeled 5 mCi Iodine 131 . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain 1 ) Day 0 ; 2 ) Day 2 , 3 , 4 ; 3 ) Day 6 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data 3 imaging timepoints , patient-specific dose Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody deliver desired total body dose radiotherapy calculate . In second phase , term `` radioimmunotherapeutic dose '' , patient receive 70 minute infusion ( include 10 minute flush ) unlabeled Anti B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) immediately follow 30 minute infusion ( include 10 minute flush ) 35 mg Anti B1 Antibody label patient-specific dose Iodine 131 deliver whole body dose 75 cGy patient hematologic risk factor . Patients platelet count 100,001-149,999 cells/mm3 receive 65 cGy patient obese dose base upon 137 % lean body mass ( see Appendix A ) . Patients treat either saturate solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior first infusion Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody continue 14 day follow last infusion Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody ( i.e. , therapeutic dose ) .</brief_summary>
