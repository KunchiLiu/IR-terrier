	<brief_summary>The standard postoperative treatment patient cervical cancer high-risk factor chemoradiation . Generally , weekly cisplatin 5FU+cisplatin every 3 week use chemotherapy regimens chemoradiation . Based experience , investigator hypothesize tri-weekly cisplatin could superior weekly cisplatin . Therefore , investigator go perform efficacy study postoperative , tri-weekly cisplatin chemoradiation patient cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Postoperative Chemoradiation Using Triweekly Cisplatin Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical carcinoma one common gynecologic cancer worldwide . The prognosis cervical cancer favorable , around 80-90 % 5-year survival rate early stage disease . However , advanced disease carry poor prognosis . The standard postoperative treatment patient cervical cancer high-risk factor chemoradiation . Based result five randomized clinical trial , consistently show improved survival patient treat cisplatin-based CRT , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) United States announce 'Strong consideration give incorporation concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy RT woman require radiation therapy treatment cervical cancer ' 1999 . Although recently report meta-analysis study also demonstrate improved local control rate survival cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent radiation therapy ( RT ) , optimal cisplatin dose dosing schedule still undetermined . Among previous five randomized clinical trial , two trial perform Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) use weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 three trial use tri-weekly cisplatin dosage range 50 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 combine 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Despite diversity cisplatin dose dosing schedule , weekly cisplatin dose 40 mg/m2 concurrent RT widely accept standard regimen CRT convenience , equal effectiveness , favorable toxicity comparison 5-FU combined regimen . However , result GOG 165 study , close prematurely interim analysis find patient 5-FU treatment group likely achieve well outcome , role 5-FU ( previously popularly included clinical trial ) radiosensitizer become subject debate . Furthermore , clinical trial perform NCI Canada compare pelvic RT alone weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 concurrent RT fail show improvement progression free 5-year survival . While author suggest several possible reason study fail demonstrate survival benefit concurrent weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 chemotherapy , investigator try find another optimal dose dose schedule cisplatin administration . In light result previous clinical trial indicate 5-FU may active radiosensitizer , weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 tri-weekly cisplatin 75 mg/m2 remain popular cisplatin dos dose schedule . However , despite possible advantage tri-weekly cisplatin 75 mg/m2 , offer increase peak concentration cisplatin cisplatin administration brachytherapy , clinical trial efficacy tri-weekly cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent RT . Therefore , investigator go perform efficacy study postoperative , tri-weekly cisplatin chemoradiation patient cervical cancer .</detailed_description>
