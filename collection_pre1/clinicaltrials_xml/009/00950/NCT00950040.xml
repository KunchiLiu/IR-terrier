	<brief_title>Brief Alcohol Intervention Reduce At-Risk Drinking Among Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At-risk drinking common among diabetic patient associate inferior diabetes treatment adherence outcome . While method reduce alcohol use population largely unexplored date , brief intervention reduce at-risk drinking well-validated patient population offer promise reduce at-risk drinking among diabetic patient , result improve diabetes treatment adherence outcomes . We hypothesize add brief alcohol intervention standard diabetes treatment , relative general health education , reduce overall drinking volume heavy drinking day among diabetic patient at-risk drinker . Furthermore , expect participant receive brief alcohol intervention well diabetes treatment adherence outcomes participant receive general health education . We also expect reduce alcohol consumption mediate effect brief alcohol intervention diabetes treatment adherence outcome . In addition , explore potential treatment mechanism . The propose study randomize , two-group design repeat measure time , compare brief alcohol intervention plus standard diabetes treatment general health education . For study , recruit sample 240 Type 2 diabetic patient large , urban primary care clinic . To eligible study , patient must report at-risk drinking poor diabetes treatment adherence . This study hold promise establish efficacious intervention approach Type 2 diabetic patient at-risk drinker likely maintain poor diabetes treatment adherence outcome absence change drinking behavior , result increase diabetes-related morbidity mortality . The intervention propose study represent novel approach reduce at-risk drinking among diabetic patient , efficacious , readily integrate treatment diabetes variety treatment setting . In addition , study provide valuable information regard relationship alcohol use diabetes treatment adherence outcome mechanisms change alcohol use among Type 2 diabetic patient at-risk drinker .</detailed_description>
