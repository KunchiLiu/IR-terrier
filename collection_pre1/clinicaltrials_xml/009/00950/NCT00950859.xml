	<brief_summary>Integrase enzyme produce HIV virus multiply human body . GSK1349572 new drug integrase inhibitor class prevents enzyme work properly therefore prevents virus multiply . GSK1349572 show effective virus short-term monotherapy study adult previous exposure integrase inhibitor . The purpose study determine whether GSK1349572 effective treatment HIV-infected patient longer respond treatment approve integrase inhibitor raltegravir carry virus resistance drug . The safety efficacy GSK1349572 50mg daily combination background HIV drug previously administer ( unless discontinuation particular drug require ) assess 10 day ( functional monotherapy phase ) , follow evaluation safety efficacy GSK1349572 give new optimise background regimen Day 11 least Week 24 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing Integrase Inhibitor GSK1349572 HIV-infected Persons With Virus Resistant Raltegravir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ( ING112961 ) Phase IIb , multicentre , open-label , single arm , two cohort , pilot study assess antiviral activity GSK1349572 contain regimen HIV-1 infect ART-experienced adult raltegravir ( RAL ) resistance . The study include approximately 50 ART-experienced subject either current past virologic failure RAL . All subject must harbour isolates RAL resistance mutation Screening . Subjects also document genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance least one compound three approve class ART ( include integrase inhibitor [ INIs ] ) . Subjects current RAL virologic failure substitute RAL GSK1349572 50mg daily continue remain component fail regimen Day 10 . Subjects historical RAL virologic failure add GSK1349572 50mg daily fail regimen Day 10 . On Day 11 subject continue GSK1349572 optimize background therapy . Antiviral activity , safety tolerability GSK1349572 evaluate Day 11 time least Week 24 . ViiV Healthcare new sponsor study , GlaxoSmithKline process update system reflect change sponsorship .</detailed_description>
