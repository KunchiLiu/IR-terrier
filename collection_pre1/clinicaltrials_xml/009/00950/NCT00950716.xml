	<brief_title>PEARL Program : Empowerment Program Patients With Type 2 Diabetes ( HK4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In global epidemic diabetes obesity , 60 % affected people come Asia rapid increase young middle age group . This rapid increase young onset diabetes major implication health care cost , quality life societal productivity . Despite amass body evidence support highly preventable nature diabetes associated complication , multiple barrier implementation quality diabetes care . Apart issue relate health care system reimbursement , silent nature diabetes associate complication well complex nature care protocols require frequent evaluation clinical laboratory parameter need diabetes patient adhere long term medication self care important factor . Diabetes prototype chronic disease cover full spectrum health promotion , disease prevention , management rehabilitation .

Adding emerge concept behavioral medicine equifinality , i.e . diverse approach may achieve similar end . Thus , multi-component program offering broad range intervention approach may tailor pluralistic need people diabetes chronic disease . Aims Study : 1 . To quantify impact peer support self management skill , quality life ( QOL ) cognitive-psychological-behavioral parameter . 2 . To quantify effect various component self management skill cognitive- psychological-behavioral parameter metabolic control , care process QOL . 3 . To examine user acceptability ( include health care team diabetes patient ) cost effectiveness multi-component system improve diabetes care community..</detailed_description>
