	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn stereotactic radiosurgery help reduce risk brain tumor return surgery . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resection Bed Post-Surgical Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After surgery remove brain metastasis , patient usually give whole brain radiotherapy risk tumor regrow area place brain . It give 10-14 daily session 2-3 week . Because potential side effect whole brain radiotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery area brain metastasis observation also use . This study use stereotactic radiosurgery observation instead whole brain radiotherapy . Stereotactic radiosurgery highly focus , 1 day outpatient radiation procedure . Observation check brain repeat magnetic resonance imagine ( MRI ) scan , perform treatment . Study Groups : If agree take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - Group 1 receive stereotactic radiosurgery area brain brain metastasis remove . - Group 2 observe routine MRI scan . You equal chance assign either group . Stereotactic Radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery offer treatment tumor remove surgery whether randomize treatment surgical bed . If assign receive stereotactic radiosurgery , neurosurgeon radiation oncologist discuss procedure detail . You also sign separate consent form , include potential risk . Stereotactic radiosurgery require placement stereotactic head frame , ring attach head 4 small pin . The frame placement do local anesthetic ( numbing medicine ) neurosurgeon day procedure remain place end stereotactic radiosurgery later day . The stereotactic frame help doctor target radiotherapy area surgery find MRI scan . The surgical area 2 lesion treat . Study Visits : You standard MRI scan brain surgery , 5-8 week surgery , every 6-9 week year every 3-4 month year , every 6 month . At time , area surgery brain tumor treat evaluated regrowth side effect treatment . The doctor also decide whether new lesion require treatment . Length Study : You consider study tumor return surgery site whole brain radiotherapy use . Additional Information : If MRI scan indicate tumor return new lesion occur brain , doctor discus treatment option include surgery , stereotactic radiosurgery , whole brain radiotherapy , chemotherapy . This investigational study . Stereotactic radiosurgery FDA approve commercially available . The comparison stereotactic radiosurgery observation investigational . Up 132 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must older 3 year age ( radiosurgical frame place child young age 3 ) . 2 . Patients must 3 few newly diagnose metastatic lesion brain complete resection least one lesion determine study neuroradiologist . 3 . The resection cavity must maximum diameter less equal 4cm . This criterion determine study radiologist . 4 . Additional unresected brain metastasis ( 2 ) must maximum diameter less equal 3 cm . 5 . Patients must consider candidate SRS within 30 day surgical resection . 6 . Patients must Karnofsky Performance Scores ( KPS ) least 70 first post operative visit . Patients 18 year age must Lansky Performance Score least 70 . 7 . Patients must able undergo MRI scan . 8 . Patients must agree randomization document sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent form . 1 . Patients receive prior radiation therapy brain reason . 2 . There radiographic evidence leptomeningeal disease prior study entry . 3 . The primary tumor smallcell lung cancer , lymphoma , leukemia , multiple myeloma . 4 . For female , pregnant breastfeeding ( The exclusion make gadolinium may teratogenic pregnancy ) .</criteria>
