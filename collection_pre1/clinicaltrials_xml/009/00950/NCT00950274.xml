	<brief_summary>In spite fact post-myocardial infarction survival rate improve recent medical advance , reduce heart function attribute irreversible loss viable cardiomyocytes still major clinical problem . The aim current study determine whether intramyocardial injection autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cell yield functional benefit addition coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery patient chronic ischemic coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intramyocardial Transplantation Bone Marrow Stem Cells Addition Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beginning 2001 , phase-1 equivalent feasibility safety evaluation intramyocardial injection autologous CD133+ bone marrow cell elective CABG surgery conduct Rostock University . No procedure-related adverse event observe improvement myocardial contractility perfusion . It decide proceed control efficacy testing , compare outcome standard CABG surgery CABG CD133+ cell injection . The result study indicate additional cell injection yield well leave ventricular contractility CABG alone ( LVEF = 47.1±8 % vs. 41.3±9 % 6 month ) . Although result encouraging , trial several limitation hamper interpretation data . Most notably , sham-injection placebo material perform control group , standard 2D echocardiography serve measurement global LV contractility . However , procedure-related complication 18 month postoperatively , especially new ventricular arrhythmia neoplasia . Therefore , prospective , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled multi-center trial conduct Germany , employ current state-of-the art measurement global regional LV contractility cardiac MRI . The following hypothesis test : `` Patients undergo CABG &amp; CD133+ cell injection high LV ejection fraction patient undergo CABG alone , measure 6 month operation '' . A power analysis base previous trial result indicate 71 patient per group need enrol reject null-hypothesis sufficient statistical power . A total 142 patient therefore enrol study . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio undergo CABG surgery conjunction either intramyocardial injection autologous CD133-enriched bone marrow cell placebo . Bone marrow harvest one two day prior surgery CD133-enriched cell product ( placebo ) prepare central cell process GMP unit . Bypass surgery perform investigational product inject border zone infarcted myocardium . Random allocation perform cell production facility , neither patient surgeon personnel involve follow-up examination know whether cell product placebo administer . The primary outcome parameter ( LVEF 6 month ) measure cardiac MRI , secondary outcome parameter include physical exercise capacity , cardiac function , safety Quality Life ( QoL ) .</detailed_description>
