	<brief_summary>Melatonin supplement report effective treatment circadian rhythm sleep disorder , include shift work dyssomnia , jet-lag , delayed sleep phase syndrome , sleep disruption suffer many blind individual . However , mechanism ( ) melatonin affect time sleep well-understood . The purpose study determine melatonin improve sleep performance schedule simulate eastward travel . This study provide information regard mechanism action melatonin critical use melatonin treatment circadian rhythm sleep disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study use randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group design . The independent variable melatonin treatment group ( 0.3 mg melatonin , 3.0 mg melatonin , placebo ) . Day treatment independent variable analysis sleep , cortisol , performance alertness data . The primary outcome variable sleep efficiency peak plasma cortisol rhythm . Subjective objective measure alertness performance wake time also assess part exploratory analysis . Safety short-term melatonin treatment assess . The experimental protocol divide 5 segment , ambulatory baseline segment , laboratory adaptation segment , initial constant posture ( CP , ass circadian phase ) , melatonin/placebo intervention advance scheduled sleep , second CP ass final circadian phase . The experimental protocol divide 5 segment , ambulatory baseline segment , laboratory adaptation segment , initial constant posture ( CP ) circadian phase assessment , melatonin/placebo intervention , final post-treatment CP assessment circadian phase . The Ambulatory Baseline consist least 21 day , outside laboratory . During segment , wrist activity light level record use ambulatory record device ( Actiwatch-L ) subject go his/her normal routine . During segment , subject maintain regular , self-selected sleep-wake/light-dark schedule ( 8h bed , 16h awake ) , sleep diary . The subject also call time-stamped sleep-wake call-in telephone system prior bedtime immediately wake time . The Laboratory Adaptation begin upon admission laboratory ( Day 1 protocol schematic Figure 13 ) continue Day 3 . The subject schedule sleep wake his/her regular time ( determined ambulatory baseline ) . This segment study design allow subject adapt laboratory environment allow subject experience standardize lighting regime prior initial circadian phase assessment . We believe another reason baseline day essential prior study individual subject experience vary light exposure pattern level . The standardized lighting condition baseline day allow stabilization subject ' circadian phase phase entrainment , also control immediate lighting history prior study intervention . Ambient light wake baseline day provide ceiling panel ordinary indoor level , light turn ( darkness ) schedule sleep episode ( black box double raster plot protocol ) . For scheduled sleep episode , polysomnographic record sleep take . Due nature study , exact time begin end study base individual subject 's habitual sleep-wake schedule . Beginning Day 1 study , saliva sample take hourly waking , blood sample collect twice hourly baseline melatonin cortisol phase/amplitude estimation . Subjective alertness assessment collect twice per wake hour , neurobehavioral performance test conduct every 2 waking hour . The initial Constant Posture ( CP ) circadian phase estimation begin eight hour habitual sleep time Day 3 continue 22 h ( show cross-hatched bar Figure 13 ) . Throughout CP , subject restrict semi-recumbent position bed dim indoor light ( see Lighting Conditions section description ) feed equivalent hourly snack . This segment study design allow assessment circadian phase either eliminating factor know suspected obscure mask circadian rhythm ( change posture , activity , food intake , light level ) distribute factor across circadian phase . The subject attend trained staff member ensure wakefulness throughout CP . Collection plasma melatonin cortisol , subjective alertness neurobehavioral performance data continue Laboratory Adaptation Segment . After CP complete , subject allow ambulatory another 6 hour 8-hour sleep episode . We choose use CPs rather Constant Routine order avoid sleep deprivation , recovery would obscure result treatment condition . The melatonin/placebo intervention day follow initial CP . On experimental Day 4-5 , schedule sleep occur 5 hour habitual bedtime . Melatonin placebo administer 30 minute lights-out . Twelve hour wake follow day ( Day 5 ) , CP asses final circadian phase begin continue 22 hour . The final sleep episode schedule 18:00 02:00 h ensure post-treatment phase estimate way compromised change sleep time . Subjects inform likely experience sleep disruption , impaired alertness symptom jetlag several day discharge laboratory . Four hour CP Day 7 , subject discharge home .</detailed_description>
