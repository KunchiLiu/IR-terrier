	<detailed_description>The majority cardiovascular event occur people low intermediate Framingham Risk Score . Despite evidence-based guideline , appropriate use lipid-lowering therapy population remain limited controversial . Strategies refine risk stratification primary prevention poorly adopt . Dissemination practice-changing trial close care gap primary care remain priority challenge . Considerable confusion remain regard optimal application lipid-lowering therapy primary prevention . Importantly , remain largely unknown tool technique use Canadian primary care physician identify global vascular risk , barrier exist implement risk reduction therapy individual . For primary prevention patient normal level LDL-Cholesterol increase risk basis elevate hsCRP , remain unproven whether statin therapy effectively reduce vascular event rate . The JUPITER trial launch 2003 compare rosuvastatin placebo 18,000 primary prevention patient LDL-cholesterol le 3.36mM also hsCRP great 2 mg/L . This trial stop early due unequivocal morbidity mortality benefit favor treatment strategy , final result available early November , 2008 . JUPITER , publish , require major change physician behavior respect screen treat cardiovascular risk .</detailed_description>
