	<brief_summary>Background : - Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory disorder central nervous system progressively weaken destroys pathway nervous system . About 10 percent 15 percent patient develop primary-progressive MS ( PP-MS ) , characterize progressive accumulation disability disease onset , without marked improvement relapse . There currently effective treatment PP-MS. - Idebenone manmade drug similar naturally occur compound know coenzyme Q10 , common dietary supplement . Research data suggest idebenone may able limit demyelination death brain cell thereby slow halt progression neurological dysfunction occur MS . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness use idebenone treat primary progressive MS . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age diagnose primary progressive multiple sclerosis . Design : - The study last 3 year divide two part : 1-year pretreatment baseline 2 year treatment either idebenone placebo . - Pre-treatment study : approximately 5 clinic visit 1 year . - Visit 1 : Comprehensive medical history neurological examination , brain scan neurological test . - Visit 2 : Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan spine lymphocytapheresis ( withdrawal white blood cell test ) . - Visit 3 : Lumbar puncture . - Visit 4 : Skin biopsy . - Visit 5 : Repeat MRI brain spinal cord , well neurological test ; test schedule 2 day . - After five pretreatment visit , patient receive 6-month supply study medication ( either idebenone placebo ) take three time day food - Patients continue regular followup clinic visit brain MRI scan , blood test , evaluation brain nervous system function . Randomly select participant additional MRI scan safety precaution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Phase I/II Clinical Trial Idebenone Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( IPPoMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal study assess safety , therapeutic efficacy mechanism action idebenone primary-progressive multiple sclerosis ( PP-MS ) patient . Study Population : Adult , untreated patient PP-MS disability range none moderately severe include trial . The upper age limit study set 65 ; set age limit permit u focus potential neuroprotective effect idebenone PP-MS limit confound factor natural age process know negative influence neuro-regeneration . Published data indicate high dos ( 10-50 mg/kg ) idebenone per day require beneficial effect neurological disability comparison low dos ( 5-10mg/kg ) sufficient beneficial effect cardiac/systemic function Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) patient . Therefore , order target CNS compartment , use daily dose 2250mg ( 750mg 3 time per day ) , provide target value 10-50mg/kg virtually adult patient . Design : This Phase I/II safety/efficacy trial adaptive trial design : one year pretreatment baseline period serve dual purpose collect patient-specific biomarkers disease progression collect longitudinal neuroimaging clinical data selection primary outcome measure . This baseline period follow double-blind , idebenone versus placebo treatment phase total 2 year . Based preliminary sample size estimate , current enrollment call total 66 patient ( 33 per arm ) . Outcome Measures : Quantitative neuroimaging measure central nervous system ( CNS : i.e . brain spinal cord ) tissue destruction clinical functional ( i.e . electrophysiological ) measure neurological disability collect every 6-12 month . Additionally , biomarkers focus analysis reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) oxidative stress collect every 12 month . The trial currently power use progression brain atrophy detect SIENA methodology primary outcome measure . However , may sensitive outcome available . In recognition , trial adaptive design : i.e . incorporate analysis progression CNS tissue destruction measure quantitative MRI marker clinical/paraclinical marker define secondary outcome measure first 30 enrol patient one year pre-treatment baseline , randomization . All define outcome measure collect first 30 enrolled patient transform z-scores compare robustness longitudinal change coefficient variation . This permit select sensitive accurate outcome measure detect progression CNS tissue damage . As result , primary outcome measure trial comparison individualize rate brain atrophy progression idebenone placebo group 2 year treatment , unless predetermine analysis pre-treatment baseline period first 30 enrolled subject determine one predefined secondary outcome measure higher z-score brain atrophy measurement . In case , primary outcome would efficacy idebenone versus placebo inhibit patient-specific slope functional structural deterioration measure sensitive biomarker CNS tissue destruction , yet define analysis 1-year longitudinal data pre-treatment baseline .</detailed_description>
