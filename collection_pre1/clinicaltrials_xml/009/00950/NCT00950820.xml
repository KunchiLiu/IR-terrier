	<brief_summary>The purpose interventional study investigate whether evidence panitumumab combination XELOX ( capecitabine plus oxaliplatin ) chemotherapy safely increase progression-free survival , XELOX alone subject KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer respond progress first line therapy irinotecan fluoropyrimidine . Further Objectives Exploratory objective may include investigation potential correlation treatment regimen epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression , detection functional genetic polymorphism EGFR gene , EGFR gene amplification ( FISH ) , EGFR downstream protein gene expression parameter , proteomics epigenetics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effects Panitumumab Combined With Chemotherapy 2nd Treatment Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects metastatic colorectal cancer KRAS-wildtype randomize 1:1 ratio receive 2nd line treatment regimen panitumumab plus oxaliplatin capecitabine ( XELOX ) XELOX alone . Before randomization tumour subject analyze detect KRAS mutational status . Subjects randomize two arm tumour show KRAS wild-type . Subjects KRAS mutant colorectal tumour receive XELOX alone . Subjects receive treatment cycle every three week . Treatment continue subject diagnose disease progression intolerable toxicity , time subject withdraw treatment phase . If subject withdraws chemotherapy due toxicity subject allow continue panitumumab monotherapy without one chemotherapy component disease progression . After withdraw panitumumab XELOX treatment , subject end treatment phase enter follow-up phase 6 month last patient stop treatment ( safety follow-up visit 56 day ± 3 day long term follow-up visit every 12 week ) . During treatment phase subject evaluate tumour response every 9 week ( ± one week ) week 45 , every 12 week ( ± two week ) thereafter , disease progression . Subjects symptoms suggestive disease progression evaluate tumour response time symptom occur .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 year , histologically cytologicallyconfirmed radiologicallymeasurable metastatic colorectal cancer . One prior chemotherapy regimen mCRC consist firstline fluoropyrimidine irinotecan base chemotherapy . Subjects must disease progression ( assessed investigator ) must candidate primary metastasectomy . Measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 guideline . All sit disease must evaluate within 28 day prior registration / randomization , diagnose investigator . Liver kidney function within defined range sufficient bone marrow reserve . Central nervous system metastasis , significant cardiovascular disease . Prior antiEGFR antibody therapy ( e.g . cetuximab ) treatment small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( e.g . erlotinib ) . Prior treatment oxaliplatin metastatic disease . Adjuvant therapy oxaliplatin base combination nonmetastatic disease allow terminate &gt; 6 month prior initiation screen without progression treatment oxaliplatin .</criteria>
