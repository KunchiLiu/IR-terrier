Up 30 subject enrol ; 3 healthy subject Cohorts 1 2 ( 2 active , 1 placebo ) 8 healthy subject Cohorts 3 5 ( 6 active , 2 placebo ) . The following CPSI-2364 dos propose : 1 mg , 10 mg , 30 mg , 90 mg , 270 mg . In Cohort 1 ( 1 mg ) Cohort 2 ( 10 mg ) , three subject dose day , least 60 minute interval dose . In Cohorts 3 5 , first two subject cohort ( one active , one placebo ) receive drug day least 60-minute interval dosing , remainder cohort dose next day subject assess . Safety lab , physical examination finding , adverse event available include Day 5 data cohort review Investigator , Study Manager , Sponsor ( designee ) order determine progression dose escalation . Subjects enrol next high cohort dose precede cohort deem safe tolerable . Doses continue escalate subsequent group maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach , top dose 270 mg reach , whichever sooner . Intermediate repeat dose level may administer addition place plan dose level , deem appropriate increase safety scientific value Phase 1 exploratory study.Safety evaluate throughout study include physical examination , vital sign assessment , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , routine clinical laboratory test ( include blood chemistry , hematology , coagulation , urinalysis ) , adverse event ( AE ) assessment .
