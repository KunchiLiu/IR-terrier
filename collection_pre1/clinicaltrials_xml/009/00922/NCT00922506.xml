	<brief_summary>OAB occur approximately 50 % 75 % men BPO 38 % men BPO continue suffer OAB relief obstruction.Symptoms OAB bothersome void complaint slow stream hesitancy . However , patient BPO OAB often treat muscarinic receptor antagonist due concern experience acute urinary retention . Tolterodine potent pure muscarinic receptor antagonist develop specifically treatment overactive bladder . Recently , study reveal tolterodine effective , safe well tolerate adult OAB urodynamically confirm BPO.However , optimal dosage antimuscarinic treatment OAB coexist BPO yet fully assess . In real clinical situation , patient complain void difficulty addition antimuscarinics want stop antimuscarinics.It probable low dosage antimuscarinics combine alpha-adrenergic antagonist use safely OAB patient BOO , efficacy . This study design investigate optimal dos tolterodine SR combination doxazosin men BOO OAB base efficacy , safety , tolerability .</brief_summary>
