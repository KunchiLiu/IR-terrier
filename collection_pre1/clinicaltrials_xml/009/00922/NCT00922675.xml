	<brief_summary>Study objective : To assess effect postconditioning infarct size patient ST-elevation infarction refer PCI . Study design : Prospective , randomize , open-label study blind endpoint evaluation . Included patient randomly allocate postconditioning control . Patients symptoms acute myocardial infarction le 6 hour duration fulfil ECG criterion primary PCI eligible . PCI follow establish routine . In postconditioning patient , additional , short ( 1 min ) , intermittent balloon occlusion apply initial opening infarct relate artery . After intervention , PCI proceed routinely stent implantation . In control group , stent implantation initial opening proceeds usual . Primary endpoint final infarct size , determine MRI 4 month . 260 patient include . Follow-up 1 year . Inclusion period : 18 - 24 month . Clinical implication : Reperfusion therapy , administer early possible start symptom , improve prognosis acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction . Still , however , many patient suffer large infarction , subsequently increase risk heart failure , arrhythmia , death . In pilot study , mechanical postconditioning show reduce infarct size thus potentially improve prognosis . However , effect postconditioning must confirm large clinical trial implement routine treatment .</brief_summary>
