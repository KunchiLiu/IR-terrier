Subjects initiate study medication oral dose 50 mg/day ( 25 mg/day East Asians ) , increase decrease clinically indicate low dose maintains stable platelet count great equal 20,000/microL baseline maximize tolerability . Platelet treatment response define platelet count increase 20,000/microL baseline three month , stable platelet count transfusion independence minimum 8 week . Erythroid response subject pretreatment hemoglobin le 9 g/dL define increase hemoglobin great equal 1.5g/dL without pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfusion support , reduction unit transfusion absolute number least 4 PRBC transfusion eight consecutive week compare pretreatment transfusion number previous 8 week . Neutrophil response define pretreatment absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) less 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L least 100 percent increase absolute increase great 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L . Subjects platelet , erythroid , and/or neutrophil response 12 week may continue study medication ( extended access ) meet study criterion . Subjects platelet , erythroid , neutrophil response 12 week may continue study medication additional 4 week ( ensure eligibility ) prior consent entry extend access part trial . Patients may remain extended access meet study criterion . The primary objective ass safety efficacy oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist ( TPO-R agonist ) eltrombopag aplastic anemia patient immunosuppressive-therapy refractory thrombocytopenia . Secondary objective include analysis incidence severity bleed episode , impact quality life . The primary endpoint portion drug responder define change platelet count and/or platelet transfusion requirement , hemoglobin level , number red blood cell transfusion , neutrophil count measure International Working Group criteria toxicity profile measure use CTCAE criterion .

Neutrophil response define pretreatment absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) less 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L least 100 percent increase ANC , ANC increase great 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L . Secondary endpoint include incidence bleeding ; change serum thrombopoietin level ( measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , R &amp; D Systems ) , health relate quality life ( measure Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form General Health Survey , version 2 [ SF36v2J ] ; Quality-Metric ) measure 12 week .</detailed_description>
