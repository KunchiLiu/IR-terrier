	<brief_title>Comparison Early Late Loading Edentulous Upper Jaw Using Cresco Prosthetic System Straumann Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study control randomise study whereby patient receive 5-6 implant place edentulous upper jaw support 10-12 unit screw-retained fix partial denture ( FPD ) . The main objective study evaluate performance Straumann implant support FPD use Straumann Implants Cresco restorative component early delay load protocol one year post-loading . The treatment group consist early loading delay load arm use Cresco restorative component load time 10 day post surgery 6-8 week respectively . The control group comprise standard delay loading protocol ( healing period 6-8 week ) Straumann restorative component . The primary objective compare change crestal bone level radiographs implant control group test group 1 year.The patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female must least 18 year age . Be edentulous maxilla subjectively desire implant support screw retain FPD The teeth implant site must extract lose least 3 month date implantation . In case Guided Bone Regeneration ( GBR ) Guided Tissue Regeneration ( GTR ) treatment , procedure must complete least 6 month prior intend surgery date ( fulfil point 5 ) . Adequate bone quality quantity six , minimum five , implant site permit insertion Straumann 4.1 3.3 mm diameter implant without use concurrent bone augmentation technique . I.e . implant insertion site must sufficient bone height implant encroach vital structure sufficient width minimum 1 mm palatal buccal bone remain . Patients must commit participate study three year followup examination Presence condition require chronic routine prophylactic use antibiotic ( e. g. , history rheumatic heart disease , bacterial endocarditis , cardiac valvular anomaly , prosthetic joint replacement ) Medical condition require prolong use steroid History leukocyte dysfunction deficiency History bleed disorder History neoplastic disease require use radiation chemotherapy Patients history renal failure Patients metabolic bone disorder History uncontrolled endocrine disorder Physical handicap would interfere ability perform adequate oral hygiene Use investigational drug device within 30day period immediately prior implant surgery study day 0 . Alcoholism drug abuse Patients infect HIV Patients smoke 10 cigarette per day cigar equivalent , chew tobacco ( great 10 cigarette equivalent ) Conditions circumstance , opinion investigator , would prevent completion study participation interfere analysis study result , history noncompliance , unreliability . Local inflammation , include untreated periodontitis Mucosal diseases erosive lichen planus History local irradiation therapy Presence osseous lesion Unhealed extraction site ( less 3 month post extraction teeth intend site ) Bone surgery ( bone graft , guide tissue regeneration technique bone enhancement ) implant placement . Severe bruxing clench habit Persistent intraoral infection Patients inadequate oral hygiene unmotivated adequate home care Lack primary stability 1 implant ( ) surgery . In instance patient must withdraw treated accordingly . Insufficient bone Other : Inability place implant accord protocol requirement</criteria>
