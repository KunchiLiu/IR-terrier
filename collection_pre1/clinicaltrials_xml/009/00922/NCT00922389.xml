	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether method ( implant stem cell derive peripheral blood G-CSF mobilization ) treatment safe effective management diabetic foot ischemia , therapeutic effect stem cell cause improve blood circulation ischemic limb would turn promote ulcer healing , prevent amputation limb relieve Sevier pain ischemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Diabetic Foot Using Peripheral Blood Derived Stem Cells Treating Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One devastate complication diabetes peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) include critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) , may result limb loss . Epidemiological evidence confirms association diabetes increase prevalence peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . The prevalence peripheral vascular disease among Indian diabetic population 13 % . This therapy provide targeted approach i.e . improve blood perfusion ischemic area lower limb induce neovascularization , would evaluate measure change transcutaneous partial pressure oxygen ( TCpO2 ) , NMR angiography local vessel , ulcer healing , pain relief , limb salvage , ABI index etc . The specific design trial enable u differentially study effect stem cell diabetic foot CLI compare G-CSF ( granulocyte colony stimulate factor ) ( one control group ) standard therapy ( another control group ) , study would also evaluate effect stem cell dose . Extracting stem cell method far easy perform compare extract bone marrow less painful patient well . The yield mononuclear stem cell peripheral blood much high compare bone marrow role CD34+ cell limb ischemia yet establish human , therefore study would evaluate dynamic different type mononuclear cell correlation therapeutic effect . This clinical trial highlight safety use G-CSF diabetic CLI separate control group volunteer would give G-CSF subcutaneous route , also would tell therapeutic effect attributable .</detailed_description>
