	<brief_summary>In treatment-resistant depression , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) show effectively reduce depressive symptom , though underlying neurobiological mechanism still unclear . The serotonergic system , particular inhibitory serotonin-1A ( 5-HT1A ) receptor , appear significantly involved effectiveness ECT . The aim study assess effect ECT 5-HT1A receptor bind potential ( BPND ) distribution human vivo use positron emission tomography ( PET ) radioligand [ carbonyl-11C ] WAY-100635 . 12 patient suffer severe , therapy-resistant unipolar depression undergo 3 PET scan , two scan take place ECT treatment , consist 6-14 ECTs , third scan take place ECT treatment . This imaging study hypothesize upon completion ECT , overall 5-HT1A receptor BPND brain depress patient significantly change . This study would first demonstrate effect electroconvulsive therapy 5-HT1A receptor binding human vivo . Given involvement 5-HT1A receptor pathophysiology mood disorder , present study would important step towards well understand antidepressant treatment treatment response . By compare treatment effect underlie biological mechanism , study might help identify biomarkers distinguish patient likely benefit ECT patient rather non-responders . Finally , investigate role 5-HT1A receptor ECT , highly discuss relevance antidepressant action elucidate might prepare ground new therapeutic strategy .</brief_summary>
