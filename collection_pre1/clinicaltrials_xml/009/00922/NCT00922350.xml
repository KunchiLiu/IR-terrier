	<brief_title>Heliox Posture Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When associate inhaled bronchodilator , heliox , mixture helium oxygen obstructive lung disease asthma , reduces turbulence airflow despite high rate , due low density . Although first report use heliox treatment asthma date 1935 , control study available clarify impact use heliox hospital admission patient acute asthma attack refractory standard treatment . The severe airflow obstruction , observed case acute asthma , also lead lung hyperinflation favor increase respiratory work increase load inspiratory muscle place mechanical disadvantage . Various body position study relate muscle activity mechanical disadvantage . These study suggest influence posture act mainly position diaphragm , thus , increase stress relate muscle abdominal effect gravity . This study aim : assess efficiency position body associate nebulization bronchodilator carry heliox acute severe asthma adult , use primary outcome FEV1 , FVC PEF secondary outcome Borg scale , inspiratory capacity , RR , HR SpO2 .</detailed_description>
