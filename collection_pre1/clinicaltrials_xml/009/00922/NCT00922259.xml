	<brief_summary>Every year human population suffers seasonal outbreak influenza result illness death . However , rate illness death seasonal outbreak significantly low suffer time influenza pandemic , experienced 1918 , 1957 , 1968 . The reason difference lie presence immunity within population . With seasonal outbreak influenza people immunity circulate strain usually weaken immune system experience serious complication . Influenza pandemic , contrast , result completely new viral subtype nobody possess immunity , leave everyone vulnerable serious complication . It estimate next flu pandemic could cause 200,000 death 700,000 hospitalization US alone . The need effective viral vaccine high . The purpose study test safety immunogenicity live influenza A strain vaccine , would able combat influenza pandemic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Live Influenza A Vaccine Avian Influenza H7N7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza , also call flu , RNA virus belong family Orthomyxoviridae consist 4 genus : influenza A , influenza B , influenza C , Thogoto viruses . This vaccine study focus influenza A . Influenza A viruses widely distribute nature infect wide variety bird mammal , include human . Influenza viral infection affect respiratory system particularly dangerous weaken immune system . Within influenza A genus , several viral subtypes classify ability produce immune response surface glycoprotein , hemagglutinin ( HA ) neuraminidase ( NA ) . In contrast specie , influenza A relatively subtypes capable trigger outbreak within human population . Only viruses bear H1 , H2 , H3 HA gene , N1 N2 NA gene circulate among human population throughout 20th century . The year 1918 , 1957 , 1968 mark extremely high rate morbidity mortality relate influenza . These also year novel subtypes influenza begin circulate among population . Because human immune system yet create antibody virus , population easily succumb flu outbreak consequently leave thousand dead impaired . It estimate next flu pandemic could cause upwards 200,000 death possibly 700,000 hospitalization . Transmission influenza subtypes waterfowl , know avian influenza ( AI ) , particularly great concern human population potential cause human influenza pandemic . In last decade , AI viruses claim life hundred outbreak . At start pandemic , human immunologically na√Øve nascent virus contains antigenically novel HA NA subtypes . In event pandemic , need effective vaccine unequivocal . This study test safety , infectivity , immunogenicity live-attenuated pandemic virus vaccine . The study open-label , inpatient trial initiate April 1st December 20th calendar year , wild-type influenza virus unlikely circulate community . Eligible participant attend study screening , include medical history , physical examination , hematology testing , liver renal function testing , H7N7 antibody titer , HIV Hepatitis B C screening , urine dipstick testing ( possible urinalysis event abnormal urine dipstick result ) , urine drug toxicology test . Female participant child-bearing age may also pregnancy test . Two day prior vaccination , participant admit isolation unit order become familiar unit procedure . There two vaccination course study . On day first vaccination , physical examination perform female participant urine pregnancy test . Only participant deem healthy dose vaccine form nasal spray administer . Following vaccination , participant remain isolation unit least 9 day . Physical examination test NW influenza virus culture perform daily discharge . They discharge nasal wash ( NW ) specimens test negative influenza least 2 consecutive day begin Day 7 . Physical examination NW influenza virus culture perform daily discharge . Participants return inpatient treatment 26 day receive first dose vaccine . Two day later , 28 day first vaccine , participant receive second dose influenza vaccine . Participants follow procedure , undergo daily physical exam test NW specimen . They eligible discharge another 9 day , provide NW specimens test negative influenza 2 consecutive day . All participant undergo follow-up test 56 , 82 , 208 day receive first dose vaccine . This test include provide interim history , assessment severe adverse event ( SAEs ) , collection blood sample , complete nasal wash , assessment treatment could potentially interfere vaccine-induced immunity .</detailed_description>
