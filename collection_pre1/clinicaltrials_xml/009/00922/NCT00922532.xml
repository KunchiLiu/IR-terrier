	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide ( INO ) In Hypoxic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial multi-center , double blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial . All mother identify prolonged rupture membrane and/or oligohydramnios , inborn infant &lt; 30 week gestational age ( GA ) birth screen enrollment . Infants meet inclusion exclusion criterion within first 48 hour birth randomize either inhaled NO start 20 ppm , match placebo , deliver mean blind INOvent® delivery device . Randomization stratify center treatment assign use interactive voice web-based response system ( IVRS ) . All infant receive 14 day therapy , follow dose reduction schedule . The primary outcome measure change oxygenation 1 hour start therapy . In order determine effect iNO therapy survival need mechanical ventilation , cross-over allow . This clinical trial attempt demonstrate pre-term infant may benefit treatment nitric oxide inhalation . A multi-center study necessary recruit appropriate number subject , reflect variability standard practice across different participate center . All treatment assignment blind order minimize risk bias treatment data collection . In addition , concurrent placebo group choose appropriate control group since may temporal , institutional national variation average outcome . Methemoglobin level measure locally collect blind manner .</detailed_description>
