	<detailed_description>Different result recently lead question classical notion accord motor cognitive deficit Parkinson 's disease tie thalamo-cortical inhibition due degeneration dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway .

Behavioral study perform Parkinson disease patient , suggest patient may experience deficit control . Aims The present study aim test hypothesis assess effect subthalamic stimulation patient ' performance Simon task . Methods Sixteen non-demented Parkinson disease patient treat deep brain stimulation involve study . They perform Simon task four condition : Stimulator ON vs. OFF x Medication ON vs. OFF . The EMG activity response agonist record task performance . Such recording allow investigator uncover partial error . This index together reaction time overt error subsequently analyse . Expected result Deep brain stimulation ( oral Dopaminergic medication ) re-install patient motor function thus predict stimulation medication improve patient executive control increase proportion partial error relative overt error . Such result would demonstrate nigro-striatal pathway directly involved executive control decision making .</detailed_description>
