	<brief_summary>The prevalence chronic respiratory failure ( CRF ) increase worldwide become 3rd cause death 2020 . At stage disease require ventilatory assistance , relate 50,000 patient France , life expectancy limit , quality life poor . CRF lead reduction muscle mass , find 35 55 % patient , profound cachexia . A reduced fat free mass ( FFM ) factor associate poor tolerance exercise halve survival . The exact cause mechanisms lead cachexia yet establish . Recently , chronic inflammatory condition quote putative cause . This chronic inflammation would involve molecular mechanism lead poor regulation balance synthesis / protein degradation muscle . A decrease plasma muscle amino acid find among patient low FFM.. In addition , decrease plasma level anabolic hormone , GH androgens IGF-1 found could explain lack protein synthesis . It well establish respiratory rehabilitation , include program exercise reconditioning , increase tolerance exercise improve quality life . Besides classical type endurance exercise stimulate cardio-respiratory system , suggest add resistance exercise . Several study report benefit strategy link intracellular molecular pathway describe ; moreover , unknown whether existence initial muscular atrophy influence gain muscle strength/mass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Muscular Atrophy Biological Functional Benefit Respiratory Rehabilitation Patients With Chronic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We therefore propose explore effect rehabilitation program include endurance resistance exercise muscle biopsy . The present study help know molecular pathway implicate muscle atrophy CRF patient assess evolution rehabilitation . This could lead individualized recommendation exercise program accord muscle mass patient .</detailed_description>
