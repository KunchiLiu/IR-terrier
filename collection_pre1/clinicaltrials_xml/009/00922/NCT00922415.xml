	<brief_title>Fecal Calprotectin Marker Macroscopic Recurrence Crohn 's Disease After Intestinal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fecal calprotectin non invasive marker intestinal inflammation . It highly sensitive detection active Crohn 's disease ( 13 ) mucosal heal ( 14 ) . Levels high 250 mg/L associate relapse , level &lt; 50 usually remission . Mucosal heal noted patient calprotectin level less &lt; 130 mg/L , mean level &lt; 30 mg/L ( 13,14 ) .It therefore excellent candidate simple clinically available surrogate marker endoscopic recurrence intestinal resection Crohn 's disease . In current study , primary objective correlate fecal calprotectin currently use Crohn 's disease endoscopic disease activity score use predict endoscopic recurrence . Our secondary objective determine cutoff early macroscopic recurrence disease base surveillance colonoscopy , compare surrogate marker . Methods This prospective non-interventional observational study , perform Sourasky Medical center Tel Aviv , two year . Patients confirm Crohn 's disease undergoing intestinal resection complicate Crohn 's disease - follow one year , undergo follow- colonoscopy 6-9 month surgery . Patients see enrollment follow-up visit , 3,6,9 &amp; 12 month surgery . At enrollment , sit disease , age onset , smoke history previous medication use register , well presence stricture fistula , previous surgery . At visit , patient question regard disease symptom , smoking , medication use . During follow-up visit , patient examine , weigh , disease activity index record . At follow-up visit , undergo follow test ; CBC , ESR , CRP , fecal calprotectin . Sera store antibody ASCA anti glycan antibody . During colonoscopy , disease recurrence evaluate two score , Rutgeerts score CDEIS score , contain 4 grade . Recurrence assess histological finding well . End point For primary outcome , check calprotecin level correlate endoscopic score . We also evaluate cutoff calprotectin correlate grade 3 4 Rutgeerts CDEIS . Other secondary endpoint include : Correlation calprotectin early clinical relapse ( within one year ) Correlation calprotectin histologic relapse ( within one year ) Correlation anti glycan antibody early clinical relapse ( within one year ) Correlation CDEIS antiglycan antibody</detailed_description>
