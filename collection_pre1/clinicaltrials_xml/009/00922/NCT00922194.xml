	<detailed_description>From 1st February 2006 till 31st December 2008 , 800 case diabetes mellitus attend diabetes clinic constituted subject present study . Majority subject state Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) . UP fifth large state India , Lucknow capital UP . The area UP 238,566 Km² . Population UP per census 2001 166,197,921 ( Census India , www.censusindia.net ) . Informed write consent , print read local language ( Hindi ) , per GCP guideline ( www.fda.gov./oc/gcp ) obtain every participant study . The study protocol approve duly constitute human ethic committee prior start study . Height measure calibrated height measure scale near cm . Subjects request stand upright without shoe back scale , heel together eye direct forward . Weight measure digital balance ( Camry® ) . The scale check every day calibration do `` know '' weight . Subjects ask wear minimum clothing weight record near 0.5 kg . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate use formula : weight ( kg ) /height ( m2 ) . Waist measure use non-stretchable measuring tape without clothing . Waist girth measure midpoint point low point costal margin high point iliac crest midaxillary line minimal respiration . Hip girth measure great circumference level great trochanter minimal thin clothing . Measurements make near centimeter . Waist hip ratio ( WHR ) calculate divide waist circumference ( cm ) hip circumference ( cm ) . Blood pressure record sit position right arm near 1mm Hg use mercury sphygmomanometer , calibrate least week . Two reading take 5 minute apart mean two take blood pressure . Fundus examination dilate pupil ophthalmologist do patient begin study . Diabetes diagnosed per American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) guideline , base either past medical record present blood glucose value show unequivocal raise fast blood glucose &gt; 116mg % post-prandial post-glucose value &gt; 200mg % . No case IGT IFG include study . Current age define age time examination ( 2006 - 2008 ) . Duration diabetes take difference current date date fast post-prandial blood sugar level meet ADA diabetes diagnostic criterion . The study participant direct consultation session study nutritionist , begin study every monthly follow-up visit . A standard diet accord ADA guideline advise , 500-1000 kcal/day less ( depend patient 's start weight acceptance ) individual patient 's requirement . Special emphasis place avoid fry food , increase intake monounsaturated fat , low fat milk , fiber , vegetable fruit . Fruits milk often avoided patient due misconception fruit , except one apple day , harmful diabetes milk `` fattening '' . The patient also encourage take non-cereal diet consist low fat milk yoghurt , fruit , vegetable green salad , week .

On subsequent visit , importance diet exercise re-emphasized dietitian , paraclinical staff author . Each case interview detail diet exercise regimen follow correction , , suggest . Each patient supply print material local language diabetes general diet particular . Drug treatment hypertension hyperlipidemia , wherever indicate , withhold study period . The extended release metformin ( XR ) , use present study Bigsens XR® ( Zydus CND ) , comprise dual hydrophilic polymer matrix system . The start dose metformin ( XR ) 0.5g twice daily meal ; dose gradually increase maximal tolerate dose . Those patient anti-diabetic drug therapy ; 4 week washout period give . All subject inform begin study possibility initial increase blood glucose value , would settle adhere lifestyle protocol dose metformin increase subsequent visit . They also inform possible passage `` ghost tablet '' stool . Patients tell withhold metformin least 5 day prior iodinate contrast radiographic study . Every patient ask perform urine dip stick test acetone , least every week find positive contact clinic immediately . They also ask report immediately case develop dyspnoea , mark vomiting , lethargy fatigue . The patient followed-up every month , earlier need . Besides repeat anthropometric measurement , blood glucose , urine examination , liver function test ( LFT ) serum lactate measure . The Glycosylated haemoglobin ( A1C ) serum lipid estimate every two month . At follow-up visit patient question detail diet exercise , deficiency , , correct . They also question detail side effect . Only case satisfy diet exercise adherence regular intake metformin include outcome analysis . All patient possess mobile phone . A message ( SMS ) send mobile phone every 15 day reinforce importance diet regular exercise . A SMS also send mobile phone overdue appointment . In subject weight loss 10 % A1C goal ( ≤6 % ) achieve , dose metformin reduce . Hypertension diagnose base past medical documentation , drug therapy hypertension subject systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg . Hypertension ( n=15 ) treat appropriate drug , first line drug ace inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker , combination anti-hypertensive drug , require . Dyslipidemia treat per ADA guideline either Atorvastatin Fenofibrate combination thereof depend type dyslipidemia . All patient 30 year age , unless contraindicate , give aspirin 150mg daily . No placebo group include due ethical consideration . All investigation carry SRL Ranbaxy Laboratories ( www.srlranbaxy.com ) , Mumbai , accredit College American Pathologist ( CAP ) approve NABL ( National Accreditation Board Testing Calibration Laboratories , Department Science Technology , India ) . The plasma glucose ( Hexokinase method ) , serum creatinine ( Jafees Reaction ) , serum blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) ( Urease-GLDH method ) LFT serum lactate estimate DADE RXL ( Dade Behring Ltd , USA2007 ) . Serum cholesterol , serum triglyceride , serum HDL cholesterol measure enzymatic method ( Randox Imola , Randox Lab. , UK , 2007 ) . The A1C estimate HPLC method ( Bio-Rad Variant II , Bio-Rad Labs , USA , 2007 ) . Microalbuminuria Albumin/Creatinine ratio estimate fast spot urine sample Immunoturbidimetry ( Randox Imola ) . Serum Insulin C-Peptide estimate Chemiluminescence technique ( Advia Centaur , Bayer Health Care , USA , 2003 ) . MS-Excel use enter manage data . The significance change various parameter study test use paired t-test data normally distribute , otherwise non-parametric equivalent test , Wilcoxon pair signed-rank test apply . Data express mean ± SD unless otherwise indicate . Values P &lt; 0.05 consider significant . All statistical calculation perform use statistical software SPSS ( version 12 , SPSS , Chicago , Il , USA ) Stata ( version 9.2 , Stata Corp , College Station , TX , USA ) .</detailed_description>
