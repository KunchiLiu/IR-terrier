	<brief_title>Is T-lymphocyte Calcineurin Phosphatase Up-regulated Treatment With Tacrolimus ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The immunosuppressive effect tacrolimus cyclosporine believe inhibition enzyme calcineurin phosphatase ( CaN ) T-lymphocytes . We demonstrate , tacrolimus decrease CaN activity patient early renal transplantation . In stable renal transplant patient treat inhibition hardly see patient treat tacrolimus , clearly demonstrate patient treated cyclosporine . One explanation finding could , calcineurin phosphatase up-regulated long-term treatment tacrolimus . The finding seem imply , tacrolimus mechanism immunosuppression apart inhibit CaN . This could implications side-effects due CaN inhibition . Among side-effects think due CaN inhibition nephrotoxicity . The result may therefore indication tacrolimus less nephrotoxic compare cyclosporine long-term stable renal transplant patient . Purpose : The aim project find long-term treatment tacrolimus result up-regulation CaN lymphocyte . Study plan : The general plan investigation compare CaN lymphocytes two group renal transplant patient treat tacrolimus . One group prior transplantation compare group stable renal transplant patient long time transplantation . CaN determine enzyme activity , amount protein , gen-activation .</detailed_description>
