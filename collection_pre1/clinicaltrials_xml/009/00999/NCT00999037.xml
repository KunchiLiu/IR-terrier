	<brief_summary>FGF-23 newly describe protein important regulator phosphorus body . This protein increase people kidney disease people need dialysis high level FGF-23 blood . However , although study indicate FGF-23 level go increased intake phosphorus , one know FGF-23 level lower patient kidney disease prevent absorb phosphorus food . This study design see happens level FGF-23 blood patient chronic kidney disease take medication prevent phosphorus absorption . Since high level FGF-23 link increase rate death patient advance kidney disease , control level may , future , way decrease heart disease patient kidney disease .</brief_summary>
