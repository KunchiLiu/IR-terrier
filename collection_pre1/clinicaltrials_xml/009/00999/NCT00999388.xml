	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson disease ( PD ) second prevalent neurodegenerative disease , affect 1 percent elderly population United States Western country . Although effective treatment alleviate symptom early PD , cure treatment slow disease progression identify , patient eventually develop severe physical mental disability often die complication . More research need cause appropriate preventive strategy PD . - The Shanghai Women Health Study ( SWHS ) establish 10 year ago investigator Vanderbilt University , Shanghai Cancer Institute ( SCI ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) US . Their primary aim examine several unique dietary hypothesis cancer among Chinese woman . Researchers National Institute Environmental Health Sciences SWHS investigator interested study PD patient SWHS evaluate biological environmental factor may put risk PD . Objectives : - To initiate long-term prospective study PD Chinese woman Shanghai Women Health Study . - To examine set biological environmental factor may raise low risk develop PD . Eligibility : - All participant SWHS cohort eligible . Design : - Researchers contact self-reported PD case SWHS , confirm ( reject ) self-report , invite clinical examination coordinate hospital Shanghai . - Cases confirm self-report invited visit coordinate hospital clinical examination , include PD clinical workup , blood urine collection , cognitive assessment relevant neuropsychological testing , interview additional risk factor exposure available baseline survey . - For could participate clinical examination , researcher ask detail diagnosis treatment history ask permission obtain medical record relevant PD diagnosis government hospital agency . - For self-reported PD case decease , researcher follow similar procedure ask consent help next-of-kin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose clinically examine self-reported Parkinson disease ( PD ) patient well establish Shanghai Women Health Study ( SWHS ) thus initiate long-term PD research unique Chinese woman cohort . The SWHS cohort establish late 1990s Dr. Wei Zheng Vanderbilt University collaboration investigator Shanghai Cancer Institute ( SCI ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) US . Their primary aim examine several unique dietary hypothesis cancer among Chinese woman . From 1996 2000 , SWHS successfully recruit 74,942 Chinese woman , age 40 70 , select community single district Shanghai overall consent rate 92 % . All participant complete comprehensive baseline survey , 88 % donated urine , 76 % donate blood , additional 12 % donated buccal cells.1 Follow-up survey since conduct biennially consistent participation rate 95 % high . Through 3rd follow-up , cohort document 220 self-reported PD case expect identify another 80 self-reports ongoing 4th follow-up survey ( 2007-2010 ) . We hereby propose clinically examine self-reported PD patient achieve follow two major aim . Aim # 1 : To initiate long-term prospective study PD unique Chinese woman cohort Aim # 2 : To examine follow specific hypothesis among woman 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Higher plasma level pro-inflammatory biomarkers predict high PD risk . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Higher plasma uric acid associate low PD risk 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) associate low PD risk 1 . Self-reported ETS exposure associate low PD risk 2 . Higher urine level cotinine associate low PD risk We hereby propose prospective study PD unique women-only cohort . The infrastructure many desirable characteristic cohort offer u rare opportunity PD research woman , particularly biomarkers . We expect establish long-term excellent resource PD research woman future . In short term , plan examine several promise PD hypothesis adequately evaluate among woman . These finding apply directly Chinese woman may also implications woman West . PD etiological research under-represented woman . Therefore , research SPS may corroborate finding woman west , also lead identification novel risk factor could generalizable Western woman .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion exclusion criterion : This study conduct within infrastructure Shanghai Women Health Study . At stage , selfreported PD case 4th followup invite . As 4th followup ongoing , start case identify first three followup add new case identify . Through 3rd followup , total 220 PD patient selfidentified 141 incident . Assuming 200 case still alive time propose study another 80 selfidentified 4th followup , approximately 280 selfreported PD patient eligible clinical confirmation current stage . Cases identified future SWHS followup eligible future SPS work . Analyses biomarkers gene conduct casecontrol manner . Overall , two control select case , individually match year birth ( +/1 ) , maybe factor survival status , baseline menopausal status , fast status , season specimen collection , time day specimen collection . These control provide exposure data and/or biospecimen baseline . Therefore current stage active field data collection carry control . As current stage , expect number Parkinson case small , therefore plan preexclude participant study .</criteria>
