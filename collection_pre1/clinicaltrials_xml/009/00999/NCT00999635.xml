	<brief_summary>Importance topic : Lower extremity amputation costly complication diabetes NHS patient . Amputation may avoid precede foot ulceration prevent . One method reduce risk ulceration neuropathic foot provision therapeutic insole . The type insole prescribe ( prefabricated verse custom make ) currently base anecdotal evidence . The idea hold many practitioner custom make insole superior effect remain speculation , unsupported evidence . In absence economic analysis , available data suggest custom insole substantially expensive NHS . This study , determine two type insole use therapeutic shoe reduce peak pressure atâˆ’risk diabetic foot , therefore important topic provide useful evidence NHS podiatry service . It course also important patient diabetes personal suffering undergoing amputation immense . The study single blind randomise control trial compare custom make 'off shelf ' insole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Insoles Used Prevent Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulceration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim The study compare custom-made functional insole prefabricate insole preventative management neuropathic diabetic foot , assess effect peak pressure , forefoot pressure time integral , total contact area , forefoot rate loading , duration load percentage stance , quality life , perceived foot health cost . Method Pilot work investigate physical property material use fabricate insole inform material selection . A single-blind randomised control trial recruit 119 neuropathic participant diabetes two Primary Care Trusts randomly allocate either custom-made functional insole prefabricate insole . Data collect issue 6-month follow-up , use F-scan in-shoe pressure measurement system . Patient perception assess Bristol Foot Score Audit Diabetes Dependant Quality Life . Further analyse carry two subgroup ; 1 ) insole effect peak pressure 44 participant pronated foot , 6-month follow-up period ; 2 ) insole durability , investigated second subgroup 60 participant 12-months . Durability evaluate term change insole thickness reduction peak pressure . To increase robustness result , data analysis calculate use three strategy ; 1 ) pure intention-to-treat analysis , include 119 participant randomise intervention ; 2 ) intention-to-treat analysis , use available data ; 3 ) as-treated analysis , include participant self-reporting full insole compliance , define 60 % daytime wear .</detailed_description>
