	<brief_summary>Main objective trial ass hypothesis whether application TachoSil速 dural sealant improve quality craniotomy procedure outcome general compare standard dural closure technique control randomized way . As primary endpoint investigator look possible postoperative occurrence CSF pad leakages need kind intervention day 30 primary craniotomy . Furthermore , investigator look surgery-related complication pharmacoeconomic endpoint hospital stay cost implant . Overall , result study provide important information whether adjunct relatively expensive implant routinely basis closure elective craniotomy safe effective , . To date , TachoSil速 often use neurosurgery surgical discipline non-standardized fashion also prevent CSF leakage dural closure . So far , adverse event directly relate product report . Theoretically , implant may associate high incidence postoperative infection ( e.g . epidural , subdural subgaleal empyema ) . On hand , know whether application TachoSil速 dural suture may reduce CSF leakage .</brief_summary>
