	<brief_summary>The study Phase 3 , open-label , randomize control trial gene therapy intervention subretinal administration AAV2-hRPE65v2 . At least twenty-four subject , three year age old , recruit . The intervention group receive AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector either The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia University Iowa determine improve visual retinal function individual LCA2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Subjects With Leber Congenital Amaurosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) disease part eye ( retina ) severely diseased . Usually detect affected people within first month life , significantly poor vision birth . Cells retina lose time people LCA lead total blindness . There pharmacological treatment available . This study focus form LCA cause change ( mutation ) DNA make certain protein ( call 65 kDa retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) -specific protein , RPE65 ) . Clinical diagnosis make function test eye . This confirm special method testing ( molecular test ) verify RPE65 correct . This study use gene therapy vector make adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) call AAV2-hRPE65v2 . Gene therapy refers incorporation new DNA cell goal supply therapeutic gene gene miss function cell . The AAV part gene therapy vector work delivery vehicle get normal human RPE65 gene cell retina . An early clinical study AAV2-hRPE65v2 conduct base demonstration safety effectiveness vector animal similar eye disease . The early clinical study test three dos vector twelve child adult . The three dos safe eye rest body individual young eight year old . AAV2-hRPE65v2 administration also lead increased vision subject , young subject show improvement . This study deliver AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector least sixteen intervention group subject , age three old ; subject receive vector eye via subretinal injection surgery ( separate day ) . The purpose research study ass effectiveness safety AAV2-hRPE65v2 gene therapy vector possible treatment LCA2 . The control group least eight subject able cross-over intervention group one year , provide still meet eligibility criterion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willingness adhere protocol longterm followup evidence write informed consent parental permission subject assent ( applicable ) . Diagnosis LCA due RPE65 mutation ; molecular diagnosis perform , confirm , CLIAapproved laboratory . Age three year old old . Visual acuity bad 20/60 ( eye ) and/or visual field le 20 degree meridian measure III4e isopter equivalent ( eye ) . Sufficient viable retinal cell determine noninvasive mean , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) and/or ophthalmoscopy . Must either : 1 ) area retina within posterior pole &gt; 100 µm thickness show OCT ; 2 ) ≥ 3 disc area retina without atrophy pigmentary degeneration within posterior pole ; 3 ) remain visual field within 30 degree fixation measure III4e isopter equivalent . Subjects must evaluable mobility test ( primary efficacy endpoint ) eligible study . Evaluable define : 1 ) The ability perform mobility test within luminance range evaluate study . Individuals must receive accuracy score ≤ 1 screen mobility test 400 lux less eligible ; individual accuracy score &gt; 1 screen mobility test run 400 lux , refuse perform mobility test screening , exclude . ( See Appendix 3 description accuracy score . ) ; 2 ) The inability pas mobility test 1 lux . Individuals must fail screen mobility test 1 lux eligible ; individual pass one screening mobility test run 1 lux exclude . Unable unwilling meet requirement study , include receive bilateral subretinal vector administration . Any prior participation study gene therapy vector administer . Participation clinical study investigational drug past six month . Use retinoid compound precursor could potentially interact biochemical activity RPE65 enzyme ; individual discontinue use compound 18 month may become eligible . Prior intraocular surgery within six month . Known sensitivity medication plan use perioperative period . Preexisting eye condition complicate systemic disease would preclude plan surgery interfere interpretation study . Complicating systemic disease would include disease , treatment disease , alter ocular function . Examples malignancy whose treatment could affect central nervous system function ( example : radiation treatment orbit ; leukemia CNS/optic nerve involvement ) . Subjects diabetes sickle cell disease would exclude manifestation advance retinopathy ( e.g. , macular edema proliferative change ) . Also exclude would subject immunodeficiency ( acquire congenital ) could susceptibility opportunistic infection ( CMV retinitis ) . Individuals childbearing potential pregnant unwilling use effective contraception four month follow vector administration . Individuals incapable perform mobility testing ( primary efficacy endpoint ) reason poor vision , include physical attentional limitation . Any condition would allow potential subject complete followup examination course study , opinion investigator , make potential subject unsuitable study . Subjects exclude base gender , race , ethnicity .</criteria>
