	<brief_summary>Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) mean patient control his/her pain medicine . In study two ( 2 ) different treatment plan Patient-Controlled Analgesia use treat people sickle cell disease admit hospital pain crisis . The purpose study find one plan well control sickle cell pain . If eligible study , assign chance ( like flip coin ) either get high continuous amount pain medicine small amount pain need , OR get small continuous amount pain medicine large amount pain medicine need . You study doctor choose plan receive , tell one assign . The doctor nurse take care know plan assign safely effectively take care pain . Some member study team know plan . We give morphine sulfate hydromorphone ( dilaudid ) pain . These medicine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use long time relieve pain . If treat pain hydromorphone ( dilaudid ) prefer morphine , may choose get study . If receive hydromorphone ( dilaudid ) preference give morphine pain . The pain medicine give IV arm . You receive morphine hydromorphone continuously IV also able use PCA machine give extra pain medicine need pain . You need push button give extra medicine pain . The amount pain medicine get plan base much weigh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>THE IMPROVE TRIAL : Improving Pain Management Outcomes With Various Strategies Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( PCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following thing do study : 1 . Each day hospital someone study team know treatment assignment come 3 time day ask question pain feeling . The doctor nurse take care also part routine care pain crisis . You vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) oxygen level check regularly part routine care . The doctor nurse may need give medicine procedure part study take care pain crisis . They talk . The doctor nurse take care hospital take care treat pain crisis would study . Being study interfere usual care treatment would receive . 2 . Each day hospital member study team answer question pain , side effect , well able move around . 3 . While hospital , wear Actigraph Micro-Mini-Motion logger , wristwatch type device keep track much move around well sleep . This help u determine well treatment plan relieve pain level . You wear actigraph Day 5 ( Day 3 child ) hospital stay , leave hospital go home sooner . 4 . Each day hospital blood drawn check well kidneys liver work . These blood test do time regular blood test whenever possible . We collect 2 teaspoon blood study day hospital . 5 . We call 3 day 14 day leave hospital . During phone call ask question feeling , medication take include pain , problem since discharge .</detailed_description>
