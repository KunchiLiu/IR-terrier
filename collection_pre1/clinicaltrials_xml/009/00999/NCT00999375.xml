	<brief_summary>Background : - Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) common chronic disease child , occur approximately 1 every 400 600 child . Children T1D unable produce insulin , hormone allow body use glucose food . Children T1D manage diabetes take insulin , monitor blood glucose level , watch diet , include carbohydrate . - Carbohydrates come many different kind food , recent research show different food different effect level glucose blood . In general , whole , unprocessed food ( e.g. , fruit , vegetable , whole grain , legume ) low glycemic index ( GI ) , mean cause small , sustain blood sugar level . Additionally , food rich nutrient . Nutrient-poor carbohydrate come food make refined grain sugar , bread , cracker , breakfast cereal ; general cause rapid increase blood sugar ( i.e. , high GI ) . Lower GI diet may help people T1D manage blood glucose level easily . Objectives : - To determine utility whole food , low GI diet management T1D . - To determine utility behavioral intervention promote healthful family dietary behavior , include eat fruit , vegetable , whole grain , legume , few refine carbohydrate . - To determine dietary intervention affect quality life , satisfaction diet , risk problem eat behavior . Eligibility : - Children 8 16 year age diagnose T1D 12 month , use insulin injection maintain normal blood glucose level . Design : - Families divide two group : intervention group participate intensive dietary intervention continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) control group dietary intervention CGM schedule contact study staff . - Intervention group family 11 family-based 2 group-based session consist behavioral technique educational content eat nutrient-dense , low GI food . CGM result give family feedback diet affect blood glucose level . At least one parent child T1D participate intervention . - Intervention topic consist goal setting , behavior self-monitoring , educational information , problem solving , among others .
