	<brief_summary>This study examine effect twice daily activity perform patient breathe aid machine intensive care unit . Activity occur bed . Activity include transfer chair even walk patient 's condition allow safe , out-of-bed activity . The investigator hypothesize early , progressive activity reduce inflammatory molecule blood , promote muscle physical health help patient recover quickly critical illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Early Therapeutic Mobility : Does Type Frequency Matter ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early therapeutic mobility ( ETM ) activity recommend facilitate recovery improve outcome survivor critical illness experience prolong mechanical ventilation . The effective dose ( i.e. , type , frequency duration ) ETM activity know limited report application effect ETM mechanically ventilate intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . Three inflammatory biomarkers , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-10 C-reactive protein , potentially alter single episode ETM activity . Systemic marker physical health ( i.e. , vital sign , delirium , muscle strength , ventilator associate pneumonia , duration mechanical ventilation ) may also positively influenced ETM . The primary aim interdisciplinary study compare immediate effect frequency -- single twice daily episode -- ETM activity effect type -- low moderate intensity -- ETM activity molecular biomarkers inflammation systemic marker physical health mechanically ventilate adult . This experimental design , use repeated measure ; subject randomize receive either one two episode ETM activity daily week day ICU . Type activity determine patient condition . The research question : 1. . What differences frequency ( versus twice daily ) ETM activity inflammatory biomarkers : interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-10 C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ? 1.b . What differences type ( low moderate ) ETM activity inflammatory biomarkers : IL-6 , IL-10 CRP ? 2. . What differences frequency ETM activity systemic marker physical health : vital sign , delirium , muscle strength , ventilator-associated pneumonia duration mechanical ventilation ? 2.b . What differences type ETM activity systemic marker physical health : vital sign , delirium , muscle strength , ventilator-associated pneumonia duration mechanical ventilation ? Data collect maximum 3 contiguous day ICU patient mechanically ventilate &gt; 48 hour , weekly examine short-term patient response ETM activity preliminary study . Daily episodes activity provide study interventionist . Repeated measure MANCOVA ANCOVA use answer research question . This collaborative study evaluate biobehavioral methodology within interdisciplinary team consistent biobehavioral method improve outcome research ( PA-07-008 ) mission National Institute Nursing Research improve treatment health base evidence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient require invasive mechanical ventilation 24 continuous hour surgical ( SICU ) medical ICU ( MICU ) P : F ratio &gt; 100 FiO2 &lt; 60 % PEEP le 10 cmH20 baseline rest vital sign HR 50110 , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 60110 mmHg , peripheral oxygenation saturation ( SpO2 ) great 88 % . There exclusion base gender minority status . Patients exclude preexist current neurological , muscular orthopedic disorder require inactivity immobilization acute care experience paresis/paralysis improve . Examples exclusionary condition include endstage muscular dystrophy , myasthenia gravis , new quadriplegia , coma , increase intracranial pressure , unrepaired hip fracture multiple low extremity fracture . Patients high risk death also exclude , use criterion establish Norton et al . : ICU admission follow hospital stay &gt; 9 day past 12 month ; age &gt; 80 presence 2 lifethreatening illness ( e.g. , endstage renal disease , severe heart failure ( HF ) ; diagnosis active stage IV malignancy ; status post cardiac arrest ; diagnosis intracerebral hemorrhage require mechanical ventilation. [ 99 ] . Subjects 400 pound exclude mobilization base judgment bedside nurse project manager ; risk staff patient harm move patient excessive weight consider likely , mobilization occur . Criteria exclusion include inability stand walk least 10 minute prior admission ; inability shift weight bed assist turning , inability staff access bariatric equipment overhead trapeze , chair , walker .</criteria>
