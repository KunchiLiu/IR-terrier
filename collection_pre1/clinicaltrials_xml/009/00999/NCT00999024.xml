	<brief_summary>An adequate oxygenation retinal perfusion essential function inner retina . There wide range autoregulation mechanism ensure sufficient ocular blood oxygen supply change systemic blood pressure intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Nonetheless , various retinopathy diabetic retinopathy , lead cause blindness people age 20-65 western world , highly associate hypoxia ( Pemp Schmetterer 2008 ) . Hence , measurement oxygen level retinal vessel need understanding ischemic disease . It well know fact commonly employ method measure oxygen saturation blood light transmission ( Kramer 1934 ) . However , approach feasible human eye . Therefore , reflection must use , mean amount incident light must estimate base amount light reflect ( review see Harris 2003 ) . This difficult task investigator field encounter several problem , include optical complexity , nonlinear sensor eye movement ( Beach et al 1999 ; Delori 1988 ) . Nonetheless considerable progress make past decade development reliable oximeter report ( Hardarson et al 2006 ) . In present study technique apply healthy subject well patient COPD room-air condition . The procedure take approximately 15 minute subject perform one eye .</brief_summary>
