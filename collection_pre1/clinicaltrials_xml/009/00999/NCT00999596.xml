	<brief_title>Image Evaluation Philips Philips MammoDiagnost DR Full Field Digital Mammography System ( FFDM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research study prospective enrich reader trial patient meet study 's eligibility criterion , subject certain constraint specify protocol , undergo SF investigational Philips FFDM mammography . Two five site participate image acquisition center . Images read 9 mammographers read SF Philips FFDM acquire image various location supervision study manager . Per new FDA Guidance document FFDM ( Class II Special Controls Guidance Document : Full-Field Digital Mammography System ) , longer requirement screen film image comparison reader study determine accuracy require . 10 image acquire protocol 2008-002a , 2010-002a European site read MQSA type study . This record modify support new FDA Guidance document . The reviewer evaluate case , use soft copy hard copy image , note mammographic attribute case document finding clinical image evaluation form , similar use MQSA Accreditation . The following attribute assess : order provide overall assessment whether image set collectively sufficient acceptable quality mammography : - Breast positioning , assess coverage breast craniocaudal ( CC ) medio-lateral oblique ( MLO ) view , separately ; - Exposure , assess visualization adipose fibroglandular tissue visualization breast tissue underlie pectoralis muscle , separately ; - Breast compression , assess overlap breast structure , uniformity exposure fibroglandular tissue , adequacy penetration thicker portion breast , exposure thinner area , motion unsharpness ; - Image contrast differentiation subtle tissue density difference ; - Sharpness , assess edge fine linear structure tissue ; - Borders benign calcification ; - Tissue visibility skin line ; - Noise , i.e. , noise obscure breast structure suggestive structure actually present ; - Artifacts due image processing , detector failure factor external breast hard-copy soft-copy display ; - Overall clinical image quality</detailed_description>
