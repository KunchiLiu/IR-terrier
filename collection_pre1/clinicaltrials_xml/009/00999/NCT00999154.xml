	<brief_summary>Background : - Obesity result many factor , include genetics lifestyle , over-eating high-calorie food physically active . Obesity affect approximately one third adult United States . Researchers often study individual already overweight obese , another approach examine people stay thin despite eat whatever want exercise . Studying thin individual enhance understand people become obese others , may lead novel treatment obesity . Objective : - To study metabolism , body composition , body temperature , physical activity , blood chemistry healthy lean adult add 1,000 extra Calories per day normal diet . Eligibility : - Healthy adult , 30 50 year age , never overweight adolescence , currently weight-stable , sedentary , eat without restriction . Design : - The entire study take 9 week include follow outpatient inpatient visit : &lt; TAB &gt; - Outpatient screen visit monitoring : Physical examination blood test screening ; , one week physical activity monitoring ( e.g. , pedometer-like device call accelerometer ) complete food diary . &lt; TAB &gt; - Baseline inpatient visit ( 5 day ) : Volunteers eat normal diet maintain body weight . Energy expenditure , body composition , physical fitness , activity level , eat behavior measure . Urine blood sample take . Volunteers may go home weekend stay metabolic clinical research unit ( MCRU ) . &lt; TAB &gt; - Inpatient feed week 1 ( 5 day ) : Volunteers eat normal diet plus milkshake added calorie . All measurement baseline week visit repeat . &lt; TAB &gt; - Outpatient feeding week 2 3 : Volunteers eat breakfast MCRU everyday next 2 week take prepared meal home ( volunteer may also stay MCRU 2 week prefer ) . Volunteers drink non-radioactive ( heavy ) water call doubly labeled water measure energy expenditure normal living environment Daily urine sample collect . &lt; TAB &gt; - Inpatient feed week 4 ( 5 day ) : Volunteers continue eat normal diet plus milkshake added calorie . This stay measurement identical inpatient feed week 1 . - Volunteers contact 6 12 month assess change body weight , diet , physical activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet-Induced-Obesity Resistant Phenotypes Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While many obesity study focus individual already overweight obese , complementary approach understand common disease define mechanism allow lean individual resist weight gain . The predominant cause human obesity inheritance gene favor fat storage efficient energy utilization interact obesogenic environment , characterize readily available , energy-dense food sedentary lifestyle . However , persistent percentage ( 30 % ) US adult population remain thin ( BMI &lt; 23 kg/M ( 2 ) ) . While individual maintain weight vigilantly control diet , exercise take medication ( ) , others may ability remain thin despite excessive energy intake without volitional exercise . To identify individual define phenotype provide unique insight energy body weight homeostasis , may yield novel approach treat obesity . In natural history protocol , recruit characterize cohort constitutionally lean healthy adult volunteer ( age 25-50 , BMI 18.5-25 kg/M ( 2 ) ) pathological exogenous factor know stimulate energy expenditure , suppress food intake , decrease absorption . We recruit volunteer weight-stable , sedentary , non-restrictive eater , characterize free-living dietary physical activity energy expenditure use food record portable accelerometer , respectively . Using inpatient control setting , carefully characterize detail 24-hr energy metabolism , body composition , core skin temperature , blood chemistry one-week metabolic diet adjust maintain his/her body weight ( baseline ) vs. another week high energy intake level ( 1000 extra kcal per day baseline ) . Overfeeding continue two week outpatient set meal provide metabolic kitchen , follow fourth week overfeed repeat measurement back inpatient setting . We hypothesize spontaneous change energy expenditure and/or calorie intake may differ individual , difference may explain ability resist body gain . The accrual human obesity-resistant phenotype significantly enhance understand mechanism energy homeostasis identify potential novel regulator control obesity .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Healthy normal men woman 2550 year age ; 2 . BMI 18.5 25.0 kg/M ( 2 ) ; 3 . Selfreported trouble gain weight , little exercise , selfdescribed friend family member overeater , never try lose weight . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . A selfreported history overweight age 18 , pregnancy woman ; 2 . Recent weight change &gt; 2 % current body weight last 6 month ; 3 . Current past history eat disorder binge eat , anorexia nervosa , bulimia , psychological evaluation ; 4 . Current past history intentional weight loss selfreport , postpartum weight loss ; 5 . High physically demand occupation volitional exercise &gt; 20 total minutes/day moderate intensity high ( measure sweating ) , &gt; 2 days/week , selfreport ; 6 . Significant dietary limitation ( multiple food allergies/intolerances , vegan diet , etc . ) may affect absorption body weight , special dietary requirement difficult accommodate study diet ; 7 . Significant physical limitation may preclude complete majority test study ; 8 . Current pregnancy , recent pregnancy ( &lt; 3 year ) , current/recent breast feeding ( &lt; 1 year ) , perimenopausal status . During study , woman may ask use birth control undergo repeat pregnancy test . Subjects refuse test exclude ; 9 . Current past medical condition know affect energy metabolism body weight regulation , include HIV/AIDS , cancer , cardiac ischemia , dyslipidemia , thyroid parathyroid disorder , hypo hypertension , diabetes ( type 1 type 2 ) impair glucose tolerance , congenital acquire lipodystrophy , hepatic , renal , neuromuscular , celiac disease malabsorptive condition , know genetic disorder alter lipid metabolism , cardiac failure assess history physical exam ; 10 . Any psychiatric condition ( include psychosis ) personality disorder judge PI CoPI would impede participation study ; 11 . Smoking ( currently within past year ) , excessive caffeine ( &gt; 500 mg/day ) and/or alcohol intake ( &gt; 2 drinks/day men , &gt; 1 drink/day woman ) , assess self report serum thiocyanate ; 12 . Taking narcotic , cocaine , marijuana would alter metabolism ( positive urine toxicology screen ) 13 . Any use medication nutritional supplement know increase EE , depress food intake , affect absorption ; 14 . Unwilling unable give inform consent ; 15 . Any clinical subclinical condition mention consider investigator significant exclusion study .</criteria>
