	<brief_summary>During prostate biopsy , needle guide rectum prostate . Although patient give antibiotic biopsy , still risk bacteria get rectum bladder , prostate bloodstream biopsy . For surgical procedure , surgical field clean antiseptic solution , common practice prostate biopsy . In study patient undergo prostate biopsy randomly assign either receive antiseptic preparation rectum preparation prior biopsy , rate infection biopsy determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose This research aim determine efficacy safety clean rectal mucosa antiseptic solution ( Povidone-iodine ) prior transrectal prostate biopsy . 2 . Hypothesis We hypothesize prophylactic cleaning rectal mucosa antiseptic solution prior transrectal prostate biopsy decrease rate infectious complication biopsy . We believe achieve without significant complication relate antiseptic solution . 3 . Justification Prostate cancer common cancer men . Since diagnosis prostate cancer require transrectal prostate biopsy , procedure perform frequently . More 6000 biopsy perform British Columbia year , 1000 perform Vancouver General UBC Hospitals ( combined number ) . In hospital , biopsy perform radiologist use transrectal guidance . Subjects receive antibiotic prophylaxis form ciprofloxacin three day start one day biopsy . They also instill enema rectum hour biopsy empty rectum . Local anesthetic inject rectal mucosa periprostatic space prior biopsy . Depending size prostate , 8 12 core tissue remove prostate repetitive pass 18 gauge biopsy needle anterior rectal wall . Cleaning rectum antiseptic solution prior biopsy routinely practice consider current standard care . Despite routine antibiotic prophylaxis , prostate biopsy associate considerable rate infectious complication . Sepsis biopsy describe literature incidence 0.1 2.0 % . Rate sepsis determine retrospective contemporary study approximately 4500 biopsy VGH/UBC occur rate 0.55 % ( Lange et al. , submit Journal Urology ) . Less severe common adverse event include urinary tract infection fever , occur approximately 10 % men undergo biopsy . Cleaning rectum prior biopsy offer potential method decrease risk infectious complication , propose use Povidone-iodine purpose . Surgical site disinfection standard surgical procedure , Povidone-iodine safe antiseptic utilized routinely surgical preparation body surface well mucosal surface , include vagina , mouth bowel . Park et al . report mean number colony-forming unit decrease 99.9 % Povidone-iodine cleansing rectum . Hay et al . report similar result Povidone-Iodine enema administration combine metronidazole . Povidone-iodine show significantly reduce bacterial concentration mucosa colon rectum . Brown et al . report Povidone-iodine enema provide safe effective mean prevent bacteremia bacteruria transrectal prostate biopsy . Furthermore , severe allergic reaction Povidone-iodine rare . 4 . Objectives The objective study : 1 . To determine whether clean line rectum antiseptic solution prostate biopsy effective decreasing rate three outcome variable : - Urinary Tract Infection - Fever - Sepsis 2 . To determine rate bacteria find rectum prior biopsy resistant ciprofloxacin . 3 . To determine rate bacteria find urine biopsy , without rectal cleaning . 4 . To determine adverse reaction antiseptic solution rectum . 5 . Research Method All subject undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy clinically indicate determined treat Urologist Vancouver General Hospital University British Columbia Hospital consider entry trial . If subject consent participation , randomize undergo prostate biopsy rectal cleaning antiseptic solution ( `` treatment '' group ) without rectal cleaning ( `` control '' group ) . A urine sample collect biopsy sent routine culturing . A rectal swab take biopsy ( rectal cleaning treatment group ) culture ciprofloxacin-enriched medium . In treatment group , radiologist perform biopsy wipe rectal line overlie prostate gauze soak Povidone-iodine . Otherwise biopsy perform standard fashion group . After procedure , subject instructed measure record temperature every 6 hour 48 hour . A telephone interview conduct seven day biopsy ascertain adverse event biopsy , include whether temperature ≥38.0˚C measure . 6 . Statistical Analysis The primary outcome study rate urinary tract infection rate fever biopsy ( see definition ) . The rate sepsis measure , study power detect difference rate sepsis . The rate UTI fever estimate literature data 10 % . A relative reduction 50 % ( absolute reduction 10 % 5 % ) would consider clinically significant . With type I &amp; II error set 0.05 0.2 , respectively , two-sided test significance , necessary sample size estimate 435 group . Assuming 20 % inability enroll loss follow , total sample size 1044 . Descriptive statistic baseline parameter provide group . The mean , median , standard deviation range variable compute applicable . The association exposure define outcome assessed univariate analysis . The proportion outcome group compare use chi square test . Multivariate analysis use logistic regression perform assess effect variable age , number biopsy core , individual perform biopsy co-morbidities . A test interaction perform . 7 . Definition Endpoints - Urinary tract infection : &gt; 100 million colony form unit per liter urine culture obtained48 hour biopsy . - Fever : oral temperature ≥38.0˚C within 48 hour biopsy . - Sepsis ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) : positive urine blood culture plus two follow within 1week biopsy : 1. temperature ≥38.0˚C &lt; 36.0˚C , 2. heart rate &gt; 90 beats/minute , 3. respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min , 4 . WBC count &gt; 12.0 &lt; 4.0 x 10 9/L , &gt; 0.10 immature form ( band ) . 8 . Summary Procedures : Eligible subject counsel office regard prostate biopsy per physician 's routine . This include instruction ciprofloxacin prophylaxis ( 1000 mg extend release ciprofloxacin daily three day start day biopsy ) use fleet enema home approximately 2 hour biopsy . The Urologist also discuss study subject time he/she order biopsy . He/she ensure subject meet eligibility criterion use pre-biopsy questionnaire . The subject able take consent home consideration discussion . It must sign biopsy subject participate study . Each subject assign study code . At time biopsy , subject randomize 1:1 computer generate random number two group . The first group ( `` control '' ) undergo biopsy accord current standard care , include antiseptic cleaning . The second group ( `` treatment '' ) undergo biopsy fashion , clean rectal line 10 % Povidone-iodine . Before biopsy start , subject ask give midstream urine sample routine culture . A culture swab also insert rectum culture ciprofloxacin-enriched medium order isolate ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora prior biopsy . The control group undergo routine biopsy treatment group , radiologist perform biopsy gauze soak Povidone-iodine his/her index finger , insert rectum . Before , Radiologist ask subject allergy Povidone-iodine , shellfish IVP dye . The gauze wipe back forth across prostate finger least five time one lateral margin . The radiologist allow least 2 minute pass prep insertion first needle prostate order allow Povidone-iodine dry . The radiologist ask subject inform Radiologist subject experience symptom allergic reaction ( rash ; hive ; itch ; difficulty breathing ; tightness chest ; swell mouth , face , lip , tongue ) . The 2 minute spend measure prostate size use rectal ultrasound probe . After two minute routine biopsy do . A second rectal swab culture take , likely negative due Povidone-iodine contamination swab , due add cost . All subject discharge recovery accord standard care . During recovery period , watchful eye keep subject treatment group develop severe allergic reaction . A crash-cart available time procedure recovery room . Should subject develop allergic reaction , radiologist take necessary measure per Radiology Department standard care protocol . The subject ask provide another midstream urine sample routine culture 2 day biopsy . This grown conventional medium . Subjects ask measure record oral temperature wake go sleep every 6 hour , 2 day procedure . A telephone interview use post-biopsy questionnaire perform subject seven day biopsy ascertain side effect biopsy , include whether temperature ≥38.0˚C measure .</detailed_description>
