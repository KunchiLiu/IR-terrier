	<brief_title>Evaluation Activity , Safety Pharmacology IPH2101 Human Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Development new treatment diseases multiple myeloma focus research . The research conduct treatment call Anti-KIR , activate body 's cell kill tumor cell . This different many treatment chemical give kill tumor cells.The primary objective study evaluate clinical activity two different dose regimen ( 0.2 mg/kg , lead intermittent saturation NK receptors 2mg/kg lead sustain saturation NK receptor ) IPH2101 administer single agent multiple myeloma patient achieve , completion first line treatment , include conventional high dose chemotherapy , stable partial good partial response ( PR VGPR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . MM initially require systemic therapy receive first line treatment , conventional dos chemotherapy high dose chemotherapy autologous transplantation hematopoietic cell , follow consolidation treatment . 2 . Residual disease consider evaluable : Quantifiable serum Mprotein : ≥ 3 g/l , except spike beta globulin area . In particular case serum Mprotein consider quantifiable ≥ 10g/l If serum Mprotein &lt; 3g/l , measurable involved Free Light Chains ≥ 100 mg/l abnormal Free Light chain ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) 3 . Responses partial ( PR VGPR ) plateau Partial response meet IMWG uniform response criterion : ≥ 50 % reduction value serum Mprotein first line chemotherapy treatment reduction 24h urinary Mprotein ≥ 90 % &lt; 200 mg /24h ; Very good partial response accord IMWG uniform response criterion 90 % great reduction serum Mprotein plus urine Mprotein level &lt; 100 mg/24h ; furthermore Mprotein spike gamma globulin area ; Plateau phase define : For patient serum Mprotein ≥ 3g/l : stable level Mprotein serum least 2 month check least 3 consecutive sample , third evaluation perform within 4 week study entry . Fluctuations ± 25 % ± 2 g/l Serum Mprotein level allow . For Patients serum Mprotein &lt; 3g/l : stable level Free Light Chains serum least 2 month check least 3 consecutive sample , third evaluation perform within 4 week study entry . Fluctuations ± 25 % involve serum Free Light Chain allow . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . 5 . Clinical laboratory value screen : Calculated creatinine clearance ( accord MDRD ) &gt; 50 ml/min Platelet &gt; 50 x 109 /l ANC &gt; 1 x 109 /l Bilirubin level &lt; 1.5 ULN ; ALT AST &lt; 2.5 ULN 6 . Male female patient accepts able use recognise effective contraception ( oral contraceptive , IUCD , barrier method contraception conjunction spermicidal jelly ) throughout study . 7 . Signed inform consent obtain trialrelated activity 1 . Age &lt; 18 year old &gt; 75 year old 2 . Previous consolidation/ maintenance therapy Imid ( thalidomide , lenalidomid ) bortezomib within last 2 month 3 . Treatment chemotherapy , systemic corticosteroid within previous 2 month 4 . Treatment growth factor ( EPO , G GMCSF ) within previous 1 month 5 . Radiotherapy bone visceral lesion within last 3 month 6 . Use investigational agent within last 2 month 7 . Primary associate amyloidosis 8 . Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ III accord CTCAE NCI 9 . Abnormal cardiac status follow 1 . NYHA stage III IV congestive heart failure 2. myocardial infarction within previous 6 month 3. symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia despite treatment 10 . Current active infectious disease positive serology HIV , HCV positive Hbs Antigen 11 . History current autoimmune disease 12 . Serious concurrent uncontrolled medical disorder 13 .
