	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity mortality dialysis patient . Although significant improvement make management CVD general population , know whether intervention would result similar benefit end stage renal disease patient . Clinical study conduct general population patient establish cardiovascular disease find strong independent association lipid lowering , primarily LDL-cholesterol , risk all-cause cardiovascular mortality . Therefore National Cholesterol Education Panel ( NCEP ) provide guideline low LDL cholesterol level goal â‰¤100 mg/dl patient major risk factor coronary heart disease . Moreover , recent Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATP III ) guideline provide option low LDL cholesterol level goal &lt; 70 mg/dl patient high risk coronary heart disease . The National Kidney Foundation K/DOQI guideline regard dialysis patient high risk coronary heart disease consequently recommend LDL cholesterol level maintain 100 mg/dl . This recommendation parallel NCEP ATP III guideline propose general population . However , data regard cholesterol level dialysis patient conflict , observational study demonstrate demonstrate clear , relationship LDL cardiovascular end-points . In addition randomize study conduct CKD patient . An observational retrospective analysis patient receive hemodialysis , U.S. Renal Data System Morbidity Mortality Study , show risk cardiovascular mortality decrease 36 percent among patient receive statin , compare . Whereas , recent large prospective study diabetic hemodialysis patient fail demonstrate significant reduction cardiovascular endpoint statin therapy . Moreover , although HD PD patient develop chronic hypervolemia inflammation common finding , relationship risk factor outcome may differ two treatment method . The likely role glucose dialysate cause dyslipidemia PD patient inherits different strength association cholesterol level outcome HD PD patient . Therefore , study aim examine clinical outcome treat chronic peritoneal dialysis patient dyslipidemia low cholesterol level , randomly assign patient either aggressive target LDL cholesterol 70 mg/dl current standard target LDLD cholesterol 100 mg/dl .</brief_summary>
