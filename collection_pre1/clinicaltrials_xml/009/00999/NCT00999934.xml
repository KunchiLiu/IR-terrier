	<brief_summary>The purpose eye movement ensure clear , optimal vision . In order see clearly , image must hold steady retina . Best visual acuity achieve image object interest bring hold fovea retina . Two main type eye movement responsible : keep image stable retina ( gaze hold mechanism ) change line sight ( gaze shift mechanism ) . Several functional class eye movement define ; distinctive physiological property suit best particular task . Thus , vestibular optokinetic eye movement hold image see world steady retina perturbation head . Saccades rapid eye movement bring image object interest , detect periphery vision , onto fovea see best . Smooth pursuit eye movement place image move target close fovea . Vergence eye movement place image single object simultaneously onto fovea . Each functional class eye movement rely different neural substrate . The clinical significance impairment specific class eye movement point involvement distinct structure pathway within brain . Thus , abnormality ocular motility often clue anatomical localization neurological disorder . Significance : This study contribute understand brain governs production eye movement , provide good insight interaction sensory ( visual ) motor ( eye movement ) system , i.e . sensory-motor interaction . It also contribute identify pathophysiological mechanism underlie human disease improve investigator ' ability diagnose encourage development new therapeutic strategy . Methods : The investigator measure eye head movement use magnetic scleral search coil technique . The magnetic search coil technique sensitive accurate technique use modern ocular motor vestibular research measure horizontal , vertical torsional eye movement . The coil easy apply well tolerated wear period 45 minute per record session . Population : A grand total 250 individual ( normal subject patient ) recruit study . Patients recruit in- out-patients Neurology Neuro-ophthalmology service Meir Medical Center . Healthy normal subject recruit faculty staff Meir Medical Center . Criteria inclusion/exclusion : The investigator study patient neurological disorder cause abnormal eye movement : Degenerative CNS diseases , extrapyramidal disorder , Spino-cerebellar ataxia , Cerebrovascular diseases , demyelinate disease , Ocular motor vestibular palsy , Mitochondrial ocular myopathy . Only patient medically stable able give inform consent include study . Criteria exclude subject include eye disease corneal scleral abrasion disease , glaucoma , refractive error great 2 diopter concurrent medication CNS-active agent .</brief_summary>
