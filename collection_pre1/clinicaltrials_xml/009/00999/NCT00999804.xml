	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common malignancy U.S . Targeted therapy tamoxifen revolutionary reduce tumor recurrence mortality early breast cancer . Using successful paradigm , continue search target biologic therapy direct receptor know potential promote tumor growth . The estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or HER signaling pathway dominant driver cell proliferation survival majority human breast cancer . Molecular target pathways provide effective therapy appropriately select patient . However , de novo acquire resistance remain major obstacle successful treatment , understand molecular pathway responsible resistance would enable discovery new strategy overcome . The superiority multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy single agent therapy demonstrate preclinical setting use mouse xenograft . Trastuzumab , pertuzumab , lapatinib , gefitinib , represent group therapeutic agent target HER family different molecular mechanism . Used single agent MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft model , drug restore enhanced sensitivity tamoxifen . However , tumor growth inhibition last 2-3 month resistance treatment occur . However , gefitinib , HER1 inhibitor , add two-antibody ( T+P ) regimen block signal HER1 dimer , complete disappearance nearly xenograft tumor observe ; moreover , evidence complete tumor eradication 50 % mouse . The combination lapatinib + trastuzumab also highly effective eradication tumor burden , evidence re-growth 200 day . These xenograft model demonstrate multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy effectively induce apoptosis inhibits proliferation , thereby result tumor regression . Furthermore , HER2 combination therapy appear effectively reduce level phosphorylated pAKT MAPK , thus result sustain tumor inhibition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study Lapatinib Plus Herceptin With Without Endocrine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer cell certain characteristic trait -- trait call biomarkers . There three biomarkers help doctor decide treatment give give patient . These biomarkers estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) , HER2 protein . Breast cancer cell large number estrogen progesterone receptor call ER and/or PgR positive . Cancers ER and/or PgR positive use hormone estrogen progesterone help grow . Not breast cancer ER PgR positive . Patients ask take part study special type breast cancer call HER2 positive breast cancer . HER2-positive breast cancer breast cancer test positive protein call human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER2 ) . HER2 locate out surface cancer cell . The HER2 protein send signal inside cancer cell tell grow divide . Two medication directly target HER2 protein . One call trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , call lapatinib ( Tykerb ) . Both medication FDA-approved treatment woman HER2+ breast cancer . Each medication attach protein long function . Once protein stop work , cancer cell longer make copy . This make cancer shrink . Both drug target HER2 ; however drug work little bit differently . Some patient respond good Herceptin , patient respond good Tykerb . Right , sure patient respond one drug respond drug . One possibility patient , HER2 protein find another way send message inside cell ( similar road detour ) . For example , one path `` closed '' drug blocking , HER2 protein find different way send signal . We think completely block HER2 protein give patient Tykerb Herceptin . Some patient HER positive breast cancer also ER and/or PgR positive . Even HER2 completely block , type cancer cell still grow use estrogen progesterone receptor . If patient tell ER and/or PgR positive , also take anti-estrogen pill along Tykerb Herceptin . We think stop cancer growth completely block HER2 protein ER/PR receptor .</detailed_description>
