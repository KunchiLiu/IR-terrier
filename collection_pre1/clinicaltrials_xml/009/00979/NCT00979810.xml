	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate high low area growth , proliferation , within tumor . An imaging technique use small amount radioactive tracer call 18Ffluoro-deoxy-L-thymidine ( 18F-FLT ) detect area rapid growth within tumor . This imaging technique call FLT PET image . This present study involve obtain one scan use FLT PET image . The goal study investigate association image finding show difference growth rate within tumor biology tumor measure sampled tumor tissue . This information may use future brain tumor patient determine best combination treatment individual patient . These study may also improve understand type change take place brain tumor tissue could improve individual patient outcome . FLT produce human use MSKCC cyclotron facility investigational new drug ( IND ) approval issue US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This mean FLT produce strict rule regulation , consider safe , approve use human certain disease condition . 18F-FLT used several research study date institution .</brief_summary>
