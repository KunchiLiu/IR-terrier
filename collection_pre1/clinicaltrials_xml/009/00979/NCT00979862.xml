	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Cilengitide Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) combination cilengitide patient recurrent glioblastoma ( Part A ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival . II . To estimate proportion radiographic response recurrent glioblastoma patient measurable disease treat cediranib cilengitide . III . To estimate proportion patient alive progression free 6 month ( APF6 ) patient recurrent glioblastoma treat safe dose determine Part A ( Part B ) . IV . To explore potential imaging technique biomarkers capture disease process treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cediranib maleate . Patients initially enrol dose-finding portion study ( part A ) . Once safe dose cediranib maleate determine , additional patient enrol dose-expansion portion study ( part B ) . Part A ( dose find ) : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 cilengitide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 25 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part B ( dose expansion ) : Patients assign 1 2 group accord prior anti-VEGF therapy ( yes v ) . Patients group receive cediranib maleate ( administer safe dose determine part A ) cilengitide part A . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
