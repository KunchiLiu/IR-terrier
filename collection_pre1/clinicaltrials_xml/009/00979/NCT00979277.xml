	<brief_summary>Recent study human mouse cancer model demonstrate crucial role monocytes/macrophages contribute cancer progression disease prognosis . However , since cancer subtypes associate unique tumor microenvironment term anatomical location , cytokine/chemokine profile stromal component , functional contribution tumor infiltrate cell monocytes/macrophages equally diverse , depend type cancer . Therefore obtain global understanding role host immune cell cancer progression , necessary accurately characterize cell context tumor microenvironment several cancer subtypes rather single cancer . In view , pilot proposal aim carryout system approach characterize functional phenotype monocyte/macrophage lineage 4 diverse human cancer type [ e.g. , Colorectal Cancer , Nasopharyngeal carcinoma , Hepatocellular ( liver ) cancer Renal cell carcinoma ( kidney cancer ) ] molecular basis tumor-induced immunosuppression condition . Besides provide global view host innate immunity molecular basis human cancer , outcome investigation crucial defining scope specific immunotherapy strategy overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression induce monocyte/macrophage-mediated antitumor response .</brief_summary>
