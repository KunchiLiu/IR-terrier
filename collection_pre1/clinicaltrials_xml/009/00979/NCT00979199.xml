	<detailed_description>Objectives study 1 . To test accuracy anatomical functional non-invasive cardiac image diagnosis IHD . To purpose `` anatomical '' information provide CTA obtain every patient together `` functional '' information provide stress radionuclide cardiac imaging ( SPECT PET ) , assess myocardial perfusion , and/or stress MRI ECHO image assess myocardial contraction . Non-invasive result test invasive reference standard . The latter consist invasive coronary angiography integrate invasive measurement fractional flow reserve ( assess hemodynamic relevance intermediate coronary stenosis ) . 2 . To test accuracy integrated model , include clinical variable , risk factor circulate biomarkers , predict significant obstructive coronary artery disease patient chronic angina-like symptom . To correlate biohumoral profile coronary anatomical-functional phenotype obtain non invasive imaging patient . To reach goal clinical characterization patient ( collect non-invasive imaging ) laboratory characterization ( include novel biomarkers cardiovascular risk ) compare patient characterization derive non invasive `` anatomic-functional '' image invasive diagnosis significantly obstructive coronary disease . 3 . To develop advanced clinical image report tool cardiology . An informatics platform develop synthetically clearly present integrated clinical imaging diagnostic profile individual patient . A multimodal imaging report tool develop include tool `` image fusion '' different image modality ( CT , SPECT , PET , MRI ) . 4 . To define cost-effective work-up diagnosis characterization IHD . To purpose cost procedural risk ( include radiation exposure ) non-invasive invasive diagnostic procedure prospectively collect . Cost-benefit cost-effectiveness analysis conduct alongside EVINCI-study clinical trial .</detailed_description>
