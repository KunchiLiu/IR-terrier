	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety give normal factor IX gene treat individual abnormal factor IX gene . Recruitment limit adult ( ≥ 18 year ) confirm diagnosis hemophilia B ( HB ) , result missense mutation coagulation factor IX ( FIX ) gene nonsense mutation associate inhibitor . Only subject evidence active hepatitis anti-hFIX antibody , treated/exposed Factor IX concentrate least ten year average 3 bleed episode per year require FIX administration enrol . Patients recruit within United States treatment St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , patient recruit England country treatment London British collaborator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study Of A Self Complementary Adeno-Associated Viral Vector For Gene Transfer Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B cause absence abnormality gene produce factor IX protein . Affected individual make blood clot effectively suffer severe bleed episode . Repeated bleed episode , specifically joint , cause chronic joint disease lead disability . This research study test safety give affected individual normal factor IX gene produce factor IX protein body . We give normal gene factor IX use inactivate ( able function ) virus call `` vector . '' The vector use study develop adeno-associated virus change unable cause viral infection human . This inactivated virus alter carry factor IX gene locate within liver cell factor IX protein normally make .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males ≥ 18 year age establish severe HB ( FIX : C &lt; 1u/dl ) , Treated/exposed FIX product ( e.g. , concentrate fresh frozen plasma ) least 10 year 50 exposure day . A minimum average 3 bleed episode per year require FIX infusion prophylactic FIX infusion frequent prior bleed episode Able give inform consent comply requirement trial Currently free inhibitor history inhibitor FIX protein A negative family history development inhibitor , Willing practice reliable barrier method contraception 3 sequential sample negative vector genome use PCR assay . Evidence active infection Hepatitis B C virus reflect HBsAg NCV RNA positivity , respectively . To consider negative active infection , two negative assay minimum six month interval require . Exposure Hepatitis B C currently antiviral therapy . Serological evidence HTLV active HIV infection . Individuals effectively treat antiretroviral therapy eligible . Specific criterion effectiveness treatment include follow : Documented CD4+ Tcell count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3 . HIV1 RNA viral load &lt; 400 copy/ml least past 12 month , include least 2 viral load test result &lt; 400 copy/ml immediate 12 month interval prior screen . Screening HIVRNA viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml . Stable HAART regimen ( drug least 2 different class ) least 12 month prior study entry . Treatment regimen change dose convenience response toxicity permit . Documented confirm ( repeat ) viral load ≥ 400 copies/ml 12 month time interval prior screen base exclusion although single , unconfirmed , `` glimpse '' ≥ 400 copies/ml permit . Significant liver dysfunction define abnormal ALT ( alanine transaminase ) , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase INR . Potential participant liver biopsy past 3 year exclude significant fibrosis 3 4 rat scale 04 . Coronary artery disease comorbid condition Platelet count &lt; 50 x 10^9/l Creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl Hypertension systolic blood pressure ( BP ) ≥ 140 mmHg diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg History active tuberculosis , fungal disease chronic infection History chronic disease would adversely affect performance hemophilic arthropathy Detectable antibody reactive AAV8 Subjects unwilling provide require semen sample Poor performance status ( WHO performance status score &gt; 1 ) Received AAV vector gene transfer agent previous 6 month Presence lung nodule ( ) suspicious malignancy screen chest tomography Presence liver abnormality suspicious malignancy screen liver ultrasound</criteria>
