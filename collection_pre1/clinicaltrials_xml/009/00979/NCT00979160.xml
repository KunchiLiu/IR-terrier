	<brief_title>Evaluation Response Dasatinib Treat Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dasatinib may clinical efficacy safe subject SM . This Multicenter , open-label , single arm Phase II study investigate clinical response rate term B/C finding mediator-related symptom . 30 adult patient treat continuous regimen dasatinib start dose 20 mg administer orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) , escalate 100 mg QD end Week 3 . Upon completion treatment induction period , subject treat dasatinib daily dose 100 mg PO QD . Patients remain dasatinib treatment 12 month unless disease progression , unacceptable toxicity reason determine treatment discontinuation . Subjects may continue receive protocol therapy long derive clinical benefit . Additionally , subject follow disease progression , death , 12 month beyond discontinuation study treatment . The total duration study estimate 36 month .</detailed_description>

KIT mutation status BM cell must available baseline ≤ 6 month prior study entry . Subjects may prior treatment chemotherapeutic regimen include imatinib either fail prior chemotherapeutic regimen include imatinib agent . At least two week must elapse last dose chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy investigational product radiation therapy , subject must recover baseline Grade ≤ 1 ( NCI CTCAE , version 3.0 ) toxicity result recent therapy prior first dose dasatinib . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . Subject must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory test , requirement study . Adequate liver renal function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ≤ 4 ULN sole cause liver elevation due SM AST , ALT alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 ULN sole cause liver elevation bone compromise due SM Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN Serum potassium magnesium level within institutional normal limit . Total serum calcium ionized calcium level must great equal low limit normal . Men woman , age 18 older . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 4 week last dose investigational product manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start investigational product . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 4 week last dose investigational product . Women pregnant breastfeeding Indolent SM ( presence Bfindings without severe mediatorrelated symptom ) Pericarditis , clinically significant pleural effusion ascites within 12 month prior study entry attributable SM . Pulmonary infiltrates within 4 week prior study entry abnormal chest Xray baseline attributable SM . Any surgical procedure , exclude central venous catheter placement minor procedure ( e.g . skin biopsy ) within 14 day prior initiation dasatinib therapy . Presence active bacterial , fungal viral infection study entry . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( NYHA Class III IV ) include preexist arrhythmia , ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , `` Torsade de Pointes '' ) , myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina within 6 month , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy . Abnormal QTcF interval prolong ( ≥ 450 msec ) electrolytes correct baseline ECG . Malabsorption syndrome attributable SM uncontrolled ( e.g . correct antimediator therapy ) gastrointestinal toxicity ( nausea , diarrhea , vomit ) NCI CTCAE Grade = 2 . Clinicallysignificant coagulation platelet function disorder ( eg , know von Willebrand 's disease ) . Prior concurrent malignancy , except follow : Adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer . Cervical carcinoma situ . Adequately treated Stage I II cancer subject currently complete remission . Or cancer subject diseasefree 3 year . Cytopenia ( ) : ANC &lt; 1000/L , hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL , platelet &lt; 100.000/L study entry unless pretreatment bone marrow exam and/or presence diseaserelated hypersplenism establish likely cause cytopenia ( ) relate SM . Other severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality , serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate study . Intolerance dasatinib . Administration hematopoietic growth factor within 14 day prior study entry .
