	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate anti-tumor activity SU11248 ( sunitinib malate ) , highly potent , selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor , patient persistent recurrent clear cell ovarian carcinoma . II . To examine nature degree toxicity cohort patient treat regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize distribution progression-free survival overall survival patient treat SU11248 ( sunitinib malate ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pre-cycle 1 , pre-cycle 4 off-treatment level pro-angiogenic protein ( e.g. , angiogenin , soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule [ VCAM ] -I , basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF ] , platelet-derived growth factor [ PDGF ] , placental growth factor [ PlGF ] , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , hypoxia-inducible factor [ HIF ] 1alpha ) . II . To identify change serum plasma angiogenesis marker baseline ( pre-cycle 1 ) , treatment ( cycle 4 ) , progression association primary secondary clinical endpoint associate clinical response progression-free survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must recurrent persistent clear cell ovarian cancer ; primary tumor must least 50 % clear cell histomorphology order eligible histologically document recurrence least 50 % clear cell histomorphology ; addition , tumor negative expression Wilms tumor ( WT ) 1 antigen estrogen receptor ( ER ) antigen immunohistochemistry ; appropriate tissue section must available histologic evaluation central pathology review Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) ; immunohistochemical stain slide ER WT1 antigen must available review GOG If primary tumor least 50 % clear cell histomorphology , biopsy recurrent persistent tumor require ; however , immunohistochemical study primary tumor ER WT1 antigens perform slide submit GOG review ; percentage clear cell histomorphology must document pathology report addendum original report ; slide primary tumor available review due disposal slide histology laboratory ( typically 10 year diagnosis ) , biopsy recurrent persistent disease require If primary tumor le 50 % clear cell histomorphology ( slides primary tumor available review ) , biopsy recurrent persistent tumor require confirm least 50 % clear cell histomorphology lack immunoreactivity ER WT1 antigens immunohistochemistry ; percentage involvement must document pathology report addendum original report All patient must measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 ; measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ; lesion must &gt; = 10 mm measure compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; = 20 mm measure chest xray ; lymph node must &gt; = 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST 1.1 ; tumor within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy ; thus , confirm biopsy irradiate area date longer 90 day postcompletion radiation consider target lesion assess progression response Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease contain carboplatin , cisplatin , another organoplatinum compound ; initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation , extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment Patients allow receive , required receive , one additional cytotoxic regimen management recurrent persistent disease accord follow definition : Cytotoxic regimen include agent target genetic and/or mitotic apparatus divide cell , result doselimiting toxicity bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa Patients receive one prior cytotoxic regimen ( platinumbased regimen management primary disease ) must platinumfree interval less 12 month , progress platinumbased therapy , persistent disease platinumbased therapy Patients may receive prior biologic therapy , must prior therapy agent inhibit VEGF , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) PDGF , bevacizumab , sorafenib , sunitinib , pazopanib , brivanib , aflibercept cediranib , BIBF 1120 , imatinib , dasatinib Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include immunologic agent ( e.g . tamoxifen ) must discontinue least three week prior registration Patients must eligible high priority ( e.g . ;
