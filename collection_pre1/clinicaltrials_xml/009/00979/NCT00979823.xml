	<brief_summary>The objective translational research study effect implement innovative simulate diabetes learn intervention within primary care residency program . The intervention use cognitive behavioral learn theory provide goal-directed feedback resident every encounter series virtual patient-physician encounter . Formulas derive pharmacokinetic data experience clinical expert model simulate physiologic response drug change , health behavior , adherence factor . The online intervention economical , sustainable , address number current obstacle outpatient diabetes train primary care residency program . In group trial , randomly assign 20 primary care residency program 700 resident total either ( ) Early learn program group ( b ) Delayed learn program group . We assess ability resident achieve evidence-based diabetes clinical goal avoid potential medical safety issue glycemia , blood pressure , lipid simulate assessment case . Secondary analysis evaluate actual use tool resident , direct cost program , resident satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aim 1 : To examine impact simulate case-based learn intervention measure quality diabetes care deliver primary care resident simulate adult patient diabetes mellitus . Hypothesis 1 : Compared delayed SimCare Diabetes learn program group resident , resident early SimCare Diabetes learn program group treat high proportion simulate patient evidence base diabetes goal include glycemic control ( A1c &lt; 7 % ) , blood pressure control ( BP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg ) , lipid control ( evidence-based LDL , Triglyceride , HDL level ) . Specific aim 2 : To examine impact simulate case-based learning intervention rate appropriate drug intensification number risky prescribe event management simulate adult patient diabetes mellitus . Hypothesis 2 : Compared delayed SimCare Diabetes learn program group resident , resident early SimCare Diabetes learn program group improve rate appropriate drug intensification simulate assessment case . Hypothesis 3 : Compared delayed SimCare Diabetes learn program group resident , resident early SimCare Diabetes learn program group lower number risky prescribe event simulated assessment case .</detailed_description>
