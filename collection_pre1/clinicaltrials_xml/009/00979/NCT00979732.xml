	<brief_title>The Effect Grape Seed Extract Blood Pressure People With Pre-Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated blood pressure , hypertension , major risk factor heart disease stroke . Systolic diastolic blood pressure meet criterion `` pre-hypertension '' double absolute risk stroke ischemic heart disease extend age range 4th 8th decade life . Lifestyle , particularly diet , critical prevention management hypertension . Polyphenolic compound various plant food promote blood pressure regulation vascular health protection endothelium oxidant inflammatory stress stimulation smooth muscle relaxation . We use purified grape seed extract ( GSE ) propose trial . This extract grant Generally Recognized Safe ( GRAS ) status Food drug administration ( GRAS Notice # GRN 000125 , date 08/18/2003 , FDA , USA ) . Furthermore , GSE use present trial use previous human clinical trail show potent vasodilator property vitro blood pressure lower metabolic syndrome patient . The propose trial aim verify blood pressure lower effect GSE 'at risk ' population hypertension explore extent pathway chronic disease may modulate GSE consumption . Given , objective study follow : 1 . The primary objective propose study demonstrate effectiveness GSE low blood pressure pre-hypertensive individual . 2 . Secondary objective investigate role GSE improve inflammatory- oxidative stress- status , well effect endothelium function .</detailed_description>
