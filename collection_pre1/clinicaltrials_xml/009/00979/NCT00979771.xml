	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Ability GSK706769 Maintain Clinical Remission After Withdrawal Enbrel Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study subject rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) stable dos Enbrel . Subjects adequate response Enbrel enrol study . Subjects withdraw Enbrel randomize receive 28 day dose either GSK706769 placebo follow 28 day off-drug . This study explore novel therapeutic paradigm RA , remission maintenance . In approach , remission induce inducing agent stop maintenance agent add . The clinical benefit would derive fact remission agent may easier take ( e.g . oral rather parenteral ) , durable maintenance remission , and/or safer ( e.g . TB reactivation ) . This study directly explore remission maintenance . Specifically , randomise , double blind , placebo control study , RA patient remission adequate response Enbrel recruit . Enbrel select relatively short half life therefore likely patient treat placebo may higher incidence relapse 28 day anti-TNF treatment . After withdrawal Enbrel ( possibly oral DMARDs ) , subject randomise receive GSK706769 placebo 28 day follow period 28 day treatment . It hypothesize GSK706769 prevent CCR5+ cell return synovium , thereby result maintenance efficacy induce Enbrel . In placebo group , CCR5 cell may re-populate synovium result increased inflammation . Patients experience increased disease activity able withdraw study resume standard care .</detailed_description>
