	<brief_title>Biweekly Avastin Docetaxel First Line Treatment Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients histologically cytologically proven measurable nonmeasurable metastatic breast cancer treat combination biweekly docetaxel bevacizumab first line treatment multicenter phase II trial . The outcome measure would PFS , Response rate ( RECIST ) , duration response , safety ( NCI CTC-AE version 3 ) survival . In addition several biochemical maker test possible predictive factor . Treatment would continue PD , patient 's refusal treatment discontinuation due side-effects patient death . In respond patient bevacizumab would continue either alone hormone receptor positive patient combine hormone treatment progression .</detailed_description>
