	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate intratumoral plasma pharmacokinetics AC480 among patient candidate resection recurrent malignant glioma CYP-3A enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDS ) . Secondary objective include follow : evaluate antiproliferative effect AC480 FDG-PET Scan ; evaluate safety tolerability AC480 ; , describe 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) radiographic response . This single institution , open label , pharmacokinetic study AC480 patient recurrent malignant glioma . The study enroll 5 patient enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) schedule undergo salvage surgical resection preoperative treatment AC480 300 mg orally twice daily ( BID ) 14 ( plus minus 2 ) day surgery ( Part I- Induction Therapy ) . After surgery ( Part II- Maintenance Therapy ) , patient continue dose AC480 disease progression intolerance , evaluate every cycle ( 1 cycle 28 day ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Study AC480 Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasma tumoral pharmacokinetics , well FDG-PET data analyze determine intratumoral plasma level AC480 obtain antiproliferative activity . After recovery surgery , patient resume AC480 300 mg orally BID evidence disease progression toxicity ( Part II : Maintenance Therapy ) . Those patient follow determination 6-month progression free survival . Patients remain treatment long clinical benefit treatment . There limit number cycle treatment patient receive provide continue benefit intolerant AC480 administration . The data collect study summarize table list mean , standard deviation , number patient continuous data , table list count percentage categorical data , appropriate . All patient data list patient parameter , statistical analysis perform data appendix create use SAS system . Pharmacokinetic analysis make determine AC480 reach intracerebral tumor tissue . Comparisons make data obtain plasma patient treat AC480 , include determination tumor-to-plasma ratio . The common side effect AC480 generally mild moderate severity include : nausea , vomit , diarrhea , fatigue , cough , elevation liver enzymes , anemia , rash .</detailed_description>
