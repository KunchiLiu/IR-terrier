	<brief_title>Study Immunoresponse Patients Treated With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When cure longer possible , cancer patient enter palliative phase . For many type cancer several treatment option available . The goal treatment prolong survival , maintenance even improvement quality life equal importance . The currently available systemic treatment option consist conventional cytotoxic therapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy so-called targeted therapy . Combinations therapy also use . Targeted therapy concern application new class drug specifically direct one well-defined molecular target relevant carcinogenesis , cell cycle regulation , tumour progression , metastasis , tumour angiogenesis and/or apoptosis . Today , successful drug class direct vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . There explosive development ongoing field many new drug become available new target inhibit combination target . Meanwhile , target therapy show efficacy many type cancer register several indication . The toxicity profile target therapy still largely unknown , aetiology many know side effect clarify . At moment , three target therapy direct VEGF register used Netherlands : Sunitinib ( Sutent® ) Sorafenib ( Nexavar ® ) oral drug Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) , intravenously drug . Clinical experience mouse study show targeted therapy could negative effect immune response . This great influence patient treat type drug . Especially drug use chronically sometimes year infection large influence health quality life patient .</detailed_description>
