	<brief_summary>The objective trial estimate follow Japanese patient advance NSCLC stage IIIB/IV recurrence failure first-line chemotherapy . Phase I part The objective phase I part define Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) BIBF 1120 dose level twice daily 200 mg standard dose pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m^2 ) determine Recommended Dose ( RD ) phase II part . Phase II , investigate efficacy safety BIBF 1120 combination pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m^2 ) compare pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m^2 ) + placebo</brief_summary>
