	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis describe paediatric disease geriatric outcome . This bone mass acquire youth progressively lose late life , without symptom pain , fracture occur . The proper management osteoporosis include improve bone mineral content first two decade life reserve build bone loss ensues . The investigator aim determine effect 10-month school-based provision high-calcium milk weight-bearing exercise program bone mineral status among prepubertal girl . The investigator ' study novel since seek determine effect intervention girl , whose overall risk much high osteoporosis later life , develop country population whose calcium intakes likely deplete . The investigator hypothesize provision either high-calcium milk weight-bearing exercise improve bone mineral density among prepubertal girl bone accrual great among intervention . In addition , investigator hypothesize change mark among whose calcium intakes low . This study use two-by-two factorial design 1 ) high-calcium milk ( 1000 mg/day ) vs. placebo ( 115 mg/day ) 2 ) weight-bearing exercise ( total 90 150 minute per week divide 3 5 schooldays ) vs. no-exercise ( passive activity ) randomize control trial , total 4 intervention group : calcium+exercise , placebo+exercise , calcium+no exercise , placebo+no exercise . The study conduct among 80 prepubertal girl ( Tanner stage 1 ) , age 7-9 year enrol one primary school one metropolitan city Philippines institution hospital Lunar Prodigy Central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) machine . Osteoporosis treatment . The problem continue become burdensome future since population age per se increase risk incidence fracture . Understanding relationship calcium exercise important since great benefit paediatric age range . The study result could provide information workable intervention promote multiple health benefit exercise high-calcium milk young child .</brief_summary>
