	<brief_summary>The propose four-year randomize study attempt test hypothesis community-based child health intervention conjunction facility-based IMCI improve child care practice , nutritional status child survival . The objective research : 1 . To measure effectiveness community-based intervention improve select child care practice community . 2 . To measure effectiveness community-based intervention improve child nutritional status reduce child morbidity mortality . 3 . To document process implementation community-based intervention scale promote select key family community practice relate child health . 4 . To undertake cost-effectiveness analysis intervention . Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) strategy develop World Health Organization ( WHO ) UNICEF reduce childhood mortality morbidity contribute improve growth development child under-5 year age Experience suggest purely facility base strategy reach significant portion population access choose use health facility . Links service provider family household level essential order ensure family knowledge , skill ability provide appropriate preventative curative care child . However , globally , actual evidence effectiveness community-based IMCI intervention implement scale meager . C-IMCI Bangladesh implement GoB partnership NGOs also active participation different community group , civil society , private sector . Both GoB UNICEF/Bangladesh agree evaluation C-IMCI implementation GoB , propose , would opportune useful provide evidence analysis lesson guide scale-up country . A cluster-randomized design use evaluation . Fourteen Upazilas facility-based IMCI already place select , 7 upazillas randomly allocate C-IMCI intervention 7 comparison . Community-based IMCI intervention upazillas implement GoB district health system comparison upazillas exist service continue , include facility-based IMCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall study design For propose cluster randomize community-based intervention trial , upazilas ( Sub-districts ) randomize either intervention comparison . The upazila low local government structure health management unit . The usual upazila population 200,000 250,000 . Fourteen upazilas facility-based IMCI already place select study , 7 upazilas randomize intervention 7 comparison . The objective randomization achieve balance basis facility IMCI intervention , functionality health system , demographic socioeconomic indicator , population size . Community-based IMCI intervention upazilas implement district health system comparison upazilas exist service continue , include facility-based IMCI . Selection Upazilas randomization The upazilas study select base follow step : Step 1 : Eligibility Facility base IMCI implement 300 upazilas December 2008 . Most upazilas select part Bangladesh high rate under-five mortality . In addition , IMCI expansion plan Government Bangladesh emphasize achieve complete coverage district select upazilas implement partner present facilitate eventual expansion community IMCI intervention . Out 300 upazilas , 100 exclude facility IMCI early stage . Within remain 200 upazilas , Government decide implement community IMCI upazials 14 district begin implementation 5 district 2008 early 2009 . Seven pair upazilas select form upzilas 6 district evaluation . We use district mortality rate upazila under-five mortality rate available . We assume variation true upazila under-five mortality rate similar district rate . We also exclude upazilas adjoin municipal area atypical . Step 2 : Pairing re-randomization The fourteen upazilas pair base demographic socio-economic indicator : population density , literacy rate ( total &amp; female ) , male female school attendance , work status , source drinking water , sanitary toilet , electricity , flow remittance . . A composite score use Principal Component Analysis construct demographic socio-economic indicator . This score use sort upazilas within district . In addition geographical location ( proximity , within district ) , population size , health system functionality ) assess use immunization coverage ) also consider pair upazilas within district . The National Nutrition Program ( NNP ) large nutrition programme implement GoB . Whether NNP cover particular upazila planning important piece information study NNP design reduce prevalence moderate severe underweight young child , address micronutrient deficiency , increase pregnancy weight gain , reduce incidence low birth weight , prevalence iron-deficiency anaemia among adolescent girl pregnant woman . Ongoing plan implementation NNP presence substantive similar community-based programme also consider select upazila . Seven ( 07 ) pair upazilas form one upazila 7 pair would randomly assign C-IMCI intervention arm comparison . We increase number pair evaluation study six seven base discussion GoB , UNICEF , WHO . The additional pair Bandarban district select request MNCS programme ( GoB/UNICEF ) . Bandarban district hilly South-Eastern region Bangladesh home ethnically distinct population GoB/UNICEF keen include district evaluation programme experience population limit . Documentation monitor implementation Documentation monitoring essential achieve proposal 's third aim - document process implementation community-based intervention scale promote select key family community practice relate child health . This documentation monitor implementation conduct qualitatively quantitatively assess feasibility acceptability intervention document intervention may may work . A combination qualitative quantitative documentation important triangulate finding study . Implementation C-IMCI component IMCI involve series process , undertaken government . To identify lesson learn process may useful setting intervention , documentation monitoring key process important . Five key process identify documentation - situation analysis , partnership NGOs , training , implementation community perception mention earlier , process document qualitatively quantitatively . While routine MIS data questionnaire analyse quantitative documentation , qualitative documentation , periodic in-depth study carry community member , different health care provider population involve intervention . These process along system process documentation describe . 1 . Documenting situation analyse The process Upazilla health manager conduct situation analysis human resource communication medium available upazilla document . This include documentation method source use establish number government health worker ( health assistant family welfare assistant ) , village doctor , NGO health worker . Additionally method source determine community consider opinion leader , number mosque imams document . Especially important process document confound factor may effect inclusion exclusion human resource communication medium ( e.g . village doctor may include wish participate , NGOs may exclude lack necessary skill infrastructure etc. ) . This documented prior intervention . 2 . Documenting development Partnerships NGOs Creation cross-institutional partnership major innovative part proposal . For reason documentation process vitally important application area Bangladesh outside Bangladesh . Documentation partnerships NGOs establish , roles government NGO partnership , modes communication factor affect function partnership identify . Further relationship partner organization mother , worker community leader need document . This documented study . 3 . Documenting train The government facilitate training module component intervention ( R1-R5 ) . The major goal documentation record process train quality training . In , special focus give recruitment method trainer participant , attendance , completion training module , factor affect participation , knowledge retention , attitude training intention practice learnt . This document begin study . 4 . Documenting implementation GoB authority plan implementation C-IMCI intervention . Development intervention already take place however continue revision , plan monitoring expect continue implementation process . The implementation process conduct District Upazilla well National Core Committee document monitor . The operation , plan activity decision making process observe documented meeting record , interview District Upazilla well National Core Committee staff . Of key importance documentation decision making process observe reason actionable decision make . 5 . Documenting community perception Prior implementation intervention , documentation attitude community baseline conduct . This address community 's current attitude towards health system health worker currently available , care-seeking pattern , area demand ( example service would like get health worker ) . In addition , documentation different community leader health care provider ( include teacher , opinion leader , religious leader , village doctor , government health worker etc ) hold determine current attitude health system , perceive barrier access health need area demand . The activity conduct end intervention . This particularly focus document change community 's health care-seeking behaviour , change knowledge attitude community leader heath care provider , social participation community leader religious leader health care , mother 's interaction outreach worker community leader perceive benefit disadvantage component approach improve child health . These documentation take place periodically throughout study . Documentation process form report provide brief overview , rationale , objectives description process . Each report record process lesson learn identify key phase process , factor affect phase , factor relate phase confound external factor . Methods documentation Qualitative : The study anthropologist carry qualitative documentation . The following method use document intervention implementation 1 . Documenting situation analysis 1 . In-depth semi-structured interview carry Upazilla health manager ascertain method source use establish type many health provider available upazilla , community opinion leader number mosque imams well confound factor may effect inclusion exclusion human resources/communication medium : 7 ( one intervention upazilla ) 2 . Documenting development partnership NGOs 1 . Focus group discussion conduct understand community 's knowledge , attitude expectation towards partner NGOs : 14 ( 2 6 7 intervention upazillas , one woman one men ) 2 . In-depth semi-structured interview carry focal person GoB partner NGOs charge enrol partnership understand mode communication associate factor work together : number respondent component determine field since number NGOs involve intervention area unknown . 2 GoB focal person intervention upazilla select interview ( 14 person total ) . 3 . Documenting train 1 . Focus group discussion carry participant train understand perception attitude regard train intervention : number focus group discussion component base number training session conduct . We one group discussion training session . 2 . In-depth semi-structured interview carry trainer understand perception regard training module , time allocate training participant 's attitude : number in-depth interview component base number training session conduct . We one trainer interview training session . 4 . Documenting implementation 1 . In-depth semi-structured interview conduct District Upazilla well National Core Committee DGHS member ascertain attitude understanding decision making process surround implementation C-IMCI intervention . 2 . Regular attendance District Upazilla well National Core Committee meeting observe decision making process , structure meeting , main issue discuss conduct . The observer particular documenting process plan decision make take account issue raise manage . The number observation attendance meeting base number meeting hold . 5 . Documenting community perception At baseline : 1 . In-depth semi-structured interview carry community member ( married woman men ) understand current attitude towards health system health worker , care-seeking pattern child health demand : 42 respondent ( 6 intervention upazilla among three interview marry woman three marry men children/grandchildren age five year age . ) 2 . In-depth semi-structured interview community leader ( teacher , opinion leader , religious leader ) carry understand current attitude towards health system health worker , care-seeking pattern child health demand : 21 respondent ( one category intervention upazilla ) . 3 . In-depth semi-structured interview health worker ( village doctor , traditional healer , HA , FWA , Govt . NGO health worker currently available community ) carry understand current role , attitude towards health system perception : 42 respondent ( one category upazilla ) . At end-line The number type interview conduct end intervention . However , piece work particularly focus change community 's health care-seeking behaviour , change knowledge attitude community leader health care provider . In addition baseline end-line , data collection may also take place type respondent throughout study understand ongoing change change community time . Quantitative : MIS data questionnaire use document intervention quantitatively . Evaluation monitoring performance community base health worker To assess adequacy implementation propose intervention necessary regularly document monitor performance community base health worker . Both utilization community base health worker quality care measure . Utilization Community Based Health Workers Quantitative data collect routine MIS , e.g. , patient register , referral slip , report , drug utilization register well report referral centre . Quality Care provide Health Workers Existing generic MCE -IMCI health facility survey tool modify , translate used ass quality care first level facility community . Information collect observation case management use standard checklist , exit interview care giver , re-examination child `` gold standard '' surveyor , interview health care provider audit supply equipment available facility community health worker . Quality care facility preparedness antenatal checkup GoB first level health facility assess use standard checklist . Quality assess baseline end line study . Evaluation Effectiveness Measuring effectiveness C-IMCI intervention implementation primary objective project . The principle outcome indicator under-five child mortality , appropriate care seek childhood illness , exclusive breast feed nutritional status ( weight age ) . The secondary outcome indicator include number antenatal care receive woman pregnancy ; delivery conduct trained birth attendant ; mother newborns receive postnatal care trained provider ; newborn receive dry wrap bath delay least three day ; newborn breastfed within 1 hour birth , infant 0-5 month exclusively breastfeed . These indicator measure population child age 0-5 year woman give birth last one year compare C-IMCI intervention area comparison area . Primary comparison make basis key indicator measure last two year project . However , baseline rate estimate identify difference two arm project commencement make comparison within intervention arm . Special evaluation design course intervention implementation understand assess C-IMCI intervention sub-components base MIS independently collect data . Household survey select household upazila provide information indicator under-five child mortality , exclusive breast feeding , newborn breastfed within 1 hour birth , infant 0-5 month exclusively breastfed , antenatal care receive woman pregnancy ; delivery conduct trained birth attendant , newborn dry wrapped immediately bath delay bathing , child nutritional status ( weight , height/length ) , under-5 morbidity , care-seeking practice associate episode morbidity , practice relate home care case management , compliance health care advice . For cost-effectiveness analysis facility community IMCI intervention activity study also track cost make estimate cost-effectiveness different IMCI intervention model . Methods Data Collection Household Surveys Three large household survey carry select study population , first commencement , midterm end project . For household coverage survey fresh sample household select upazila . The sample HHs draw multi-stage sample process . In upazila , first village randomly select probability proportional size ( PPS ) sample second stage fix number household select randomly household list select village reach desired number household . Each village map household select village list . The household list contain bari name household head name every exist household . Data collector identify sample household village ( cluster ) complete interview caretaker available under-5 child household , include mother newborn bear previous 12 month . The baseline survey complete within first 6 month project use Demographic Health Survey-type instrument . The instrument use IMCI-MCE study Matlab , Bangladesh Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2007 ( BDHS ) adapt , use purpose . Information socio-economic demographic variable , practice care pregnancy , delivery delivery , immediate newborn care , care seek practice under-five child episodes morbidity , practice relate home care case management , contact service provider , compliance health care advice , user cost collect . Morbidity data base 2-weeks recall diarrhea , ARI serious illness . Causes under-5 death , water sanitation condition possible confounders correlate mortality collect baseline survey difference intervention comparison arm baseline adjust analysis . The midterm survey provide insight direction achievement project objective use modification intervention . The end-of-project ( EoP ) survey ( year 4 ) complete similar tool use baseline . The EoP survey complete last 6 month period . A mortality survey module include End Project survey . The data use estimate baseline mortality level . Cost-effectiveness analysis facility community IMCI intervention activity : For purpose cost-effectiveness analysis facility community IMCI intervention study also track cost make estimate cost-effectiveness different IMCI intervention ( Facility Community IMCI ) . The analysis cost effect generate 2 cost-effectiveness ratio term cost per YLS ( Years Life Saved ) . 1 . Total cost IMCI/YLS treat under-five base facility community IMCI . 2 . Incremental cost introduce community IMCI ( aggregate approach ) /difference YLS intervention comparison district . This show additional cost add community IMCI current system justify additional health benefit . Cost data collect three facility IMCI upazilas three facility community IMCI upazilas societal perspective . Programme intervention cost ( case facility community IMCI ) , directly compare change outcome measure cost-effectiveness analysis , collect research team include payment health worker ; train course health worker ; drug , supply , activity course intervention ; amortize capital cost ( equipment , vehicle , building ) . We track include capital cost , use depreciation technique calculate portion investment cost appropriate include cost-effectiveness calculation . Users ' cost ( individual family ) measure household survey . These cost include direct financial payment service , well transportation cost amount time individual spend use service intervention . Time cost translate financial cost base economic level household , measure household survey . In addition effort capture programme user ' cost capture Provider cost associate project activity . Data collection focus amass cost associate provision IMCI service health facility community level . Major direct cost category include cost associated staff time treat 5 child drug community activity . While major indirect cost category include building cost ( e.g . percent capital recurrent cost , include electricity maintenance cost ) ; proportion non-medical staff salary cost ( e.g . clean staff , security guard ) etc . Survey management Quality control The study team recruit data collector local supervisor upazilla level . Training Trainors ( ToT ) arrange Dhaka train data collector arrange upazilla level . All training , data collection process , progress quality closely monitored central team ICDDR , B . Data quality Data management All questionnaires data form review accuracy , consistency completeness . Repeat interview conduct 5 % sample household . The Project Coordinator investigator make periodic field visit observe data collection interviewer . All data enter database use on-line custom-designed data entry programme necessary range consistency check build . Data periodically check run review frequency distribution cross tabulation . Ethical Considerations No child study area deprive exist health care service service schedule implemented area study period . Children intervention area expect benefited intervention promote family community practice , e.g. , intensive education family communities improved child care care seek . If study hypothesis proven correct , community IMCI could scale child study area benefit . Sample Size Calculation Outcome Variable ( ) Sample Size Calculation Since upazila unit randomization , sample size calculation carry determine number household need detecting expect decline under-5 mortality/1,000 live birth , assume 7 upazilas group , allow cluster level randomization . The formula estimate number cluster need give cluster size ( n ) . Since know number cluster group fix 6 7 , also use formula estimate cluster size ( n ) give indicator . Here k coefficient variation true ( population ) proportion cluster within group . The estimation do iteratively base t-distribution , confidence level 95 % , 80 % power , assume refusal rate 20 % expect 20 % reduction under-5 mortality . Thus get 6 cluster require arm ( intervention comparison ) . 9,375households need upazila measure 20 % under-5 mortality reduction . The sample HHs draw multi-stage sample process . In first stage 60 village select probability proportional size upazila second stage fix number household randomly select 60 village reach 9,375 household . If select village include enough household add household near village . A sub-sample 930 household include 110 household woman give birth last one year upazila require baseline , midterm final household coverage survey . At first stage 30 village select upazila PPS sample second stage 31 household randomly select household list . If select village include enough household add household near village . The procedure repeat survey draw fresh sample 930 household . Data collector identify sample household interview caretaker available under-5 child household , include mother newborns give birth previous 12 month</detailed_description>
