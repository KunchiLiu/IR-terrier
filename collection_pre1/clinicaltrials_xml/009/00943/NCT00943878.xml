	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety immune response ( body 's defense disease ) experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine 2009 H1N1 virus . This study help determine H1N1 flu shot give seasonal flu shot make effective . Participants include 850 healthy adult , age 18 older . Participants receive 2 H1N1 vaccine addition placebo ( inactive substance ) seasonal flu shot 3 study visit 21 day apart .

	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . Adults likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . If novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus continue circulate , possible co-circulate non-pandemic seasonal influenza strain . In situation , might beneficial co-administer H1N1 vaccine concurrent seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine . This protocol explore vaccination 2009-2010 license seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) effect antibody response novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus examines receive H1N1 vaccine either concurrent , prior , follow seasonal influenza vaccine affect antibody response seasonal influenza vaccine . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase II study 850 healthy male non-pregnant female , age 18 older . The study investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine give concurrent sequentially ( ) TIV . The primary safety objective ass safety unadjuvanted , inactivate H1N1 influenza vaccine administer either concurrent , prior , follow licensed seasonal influenza vaccination . The primary immunogenicity objective ass effect TIV antibody response unadjuvanted , inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine assess hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) , stratify age recipient . The secondary objective immunogenicity , assess effect H1N1 vaccine administration antibody response TIV assess HAI , stratify age recipient . Subjects randomize 4 group , stratify age ( 200 subject per group 100 subject per age stratum , 18-64 great equal 65 year age ) . Group 1 receive two 15 microgram ( mcg ) dose H1N1 vaccine Days 0 21 follow TIV Day 42 . Group 2 receive two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine first dose administer concurrently TIV . Group 3 receive two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine second dose administer concurrently TIV . Group 4 receive TIV administer Day 0 follow two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine Days 21 42 . In order maintain blind , subject also receive placebo ( normal saline ) two product administer Days 0 21 , one product administer Day 42 group . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 8 month post first vaccination ( Day 222 ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include HAI</detailed_description>
