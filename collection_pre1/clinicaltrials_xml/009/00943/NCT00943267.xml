	<brief_summary>Recombinant human Activated Protein C ( rhAPC ) show reduce mortality patient severe sepsis . The biological effect APC pleiotropic , roughly divide anticoagulant cytoprotective effect . Lung infection inflammation associate reduce bronchoalveolar level endogenous APC . Recent evidence derive animal study indicate local administration rAPC lung exert local anti-inflammatory anticoagulant effect . In study propose study potential locally administer APC , within lung subsegment , inhibit lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induce lung inflammation coagulation human .</brief_summary>
