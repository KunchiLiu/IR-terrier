	<brief_title>PEAK PlasmaBlade™ 4.0 Versus Traditional Electrosurgery Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mastectomy surgical procedure perform remove breast tissue contain cancer , high probability contain cancer . During procedure , scalpel use skin incision traditional electrosurgical device use cut away breast tissue chest control bleed . Once breast tissue remove remain skin edge bring together suture . Following mastectomy , common complication persistent serous wound drainage seroma , collection fluid close surgical space . To help prevent complication tissue drain use remove serous fluid surgical space via bulb suction . The rate serous fluid collection use determine time drain remain place . Although suction drain help reduce seroma formation , prolong use may delay healing , cause injury , increase risk infection patient discomfort . The PEAK PlasmaBlade™ use pulse radiofrequency ( RF ) energy enable precision cut coagulate point application , without thermal damage surround tissue normally see traditional electrosurgery . The PlasmaBlade receive FDA clearance use plastic , general , ENT surgery , demonstrate significantly reduce serous drainage tissue reduction surgery , like mastectomy . This multi-site study grant IRB approval conduct June 2009 January 2011 . Potential subject screen inclusion exclusion criterion study protocol require provide informed consent prior enrollment . Following enrollment , subject prospectively randomize SOC PlasmaBlade ( PB PEAK ) study group schedule mastectomy without day reconstruction .</detailed_description>
