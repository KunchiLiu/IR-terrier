	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To determine proportion Asian patient achieve target area curve ( AUC ) 20-24 mg.h/L use pharmacokinetically guide 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) dose 2 . To determine safety tolerability dose adjust 5-FU 3 . To correlate 5-FU pharmacokinetics gene variant associate 5-FU pathway clinical outcome Based Western data , level 5-FU highly variable dos base BSA . A relationship systemic plasma level 5-FU treatment toxicity efficacy exist . Whilst pharmacokinetically-guided dose management show improve 5-FU efficacy tolerance , currently data Asian patient use approach . Using pharmacokinetically guide 5-FU-dose adjustment , investigator hypothesize proportion Asian patient achieve target AUC 20-24 mg.h/L similar Caucasians . METHODS : This open , non-randomised single center Phase II study evaluate dose adjust 5-FU patient receive de Gramont , FOLFIRI mFOLFOX-6 schedule .</brief_summary>
