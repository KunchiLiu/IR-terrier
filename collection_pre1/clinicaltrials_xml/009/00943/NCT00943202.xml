	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety immune response ( body 's defense disease ) experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine 2009 H1N1 virus . This study help determine H1N1 flu shot give seasonal flu shot make effective . The 650 participant divide follow age group : infant 6 months-36 month old , child 36 months-9 year old , adolescents 10-17 year old . Each age group 200 child . There 4 treatment group age level . Study procedures include : medical history , target physical exam base history , maintain memory aid , blood sample collection . Participants involve study 8 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . In addition , adult likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . If novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus continue circulate , possible co-circulate non-pandemic seasonal influenza strain . In situation , might beneficial co-administer H1N1 vaccine concurrent seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine . This protocol explore vaccination 2009-2010 licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) effect antibody response novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus . This protocol also examine receive H1N1 vaccine either concurrent , prior , follow seasonal influenza vaccine affect antibody response seasonal influenza vaccine . A randomized Phase II study infant , toddler , child adolescent . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine give concurrent seasonal TIV , sequentially ( ) seasonal influenza vaccine . Primary objective : safety , assess safety unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine administer either concurrent , prior , follow licensed seasonal influenza vaccination ; immunogenicity , assess effect TIV administration antibody response unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine assess HAI , stratify age recipient . The secondary objective : immunogenicity , assess effect H1N1 vaccine administration antibody response TIV assess HAI , stratify age recipient . Subjects randomize 4 group , stratify age ( 150 subject per group 50 subject per age stratum : great equal 6- &lt; 36 month , great equal 36 months-9 year , 10-17 year ) , receive two 15 mcg dos inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine Days 0 21 follow TIV Day 42 ( Group 1 ) , two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine first dose administer concurrently TIV ( Group 2 ) , two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine second dose administer concurrently TIV ( Group 3 ) , TIV administer Day 0 follow two 15 mcg dos H1N1 vaccine Days 21 42 ( Group 4 ) . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 8 month post first vaccination ( Day 201 Groups 2 3 Day 222 Groups 1 4 ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include HAI neutralize antibody test prior vaccination , day vaccination ( Days 0 , 21 42 ) 21 day follow third vaccine .</detailed_description>
