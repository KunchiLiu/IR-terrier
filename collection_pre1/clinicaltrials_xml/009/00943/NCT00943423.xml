	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A PET scan may help doctor learn cancer respond combination chemotherapy whether radiation therapy also require . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give PET scan see well work decide whether patient receive combination chemotherapy stage IA stage IIA Hodgkin lymphoma also need radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Scan Planning Treatment Patients Undergoing Combination Chemotherapy For Stage IA Stage IIA Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether patient stage IA IIA Hodgkin lymphoma negative fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) image 3 course chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride , bleomycin sulfate , vinblastine , dacarbazine ( ABVD ) require consolidation radiotherapy ( area previous involvement ) order delay prevent disease progression . OUTLINE : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , bleomycin sulfate IV , vinblastine IV , dacarbazine IV ( ABVD ) day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course . On day 15 third course chemotherapy , patient undergo CT scan neck , thorax , abdomen pelvis . Patients nonresponsive disease progressive disease remove study . Patients achieve response undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) . Patients positive FDG-PET scan receive additional course ABVD undergo involve field radiotherapy . Patients negative FDG-PET scan randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Within 6 week completion course 3 chemotherapy , patient undergo involved field radiotherapy disease area . - Arm II : Patients receive treatment . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
