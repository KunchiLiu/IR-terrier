	<brief_summary>Background : - Bronchiectasis disease characterize airway inflame , abnormally dilate , chronically infect . Individuals bronchiectasis history chronic recur respiratory infection . Depending underlying cause , infection may involve entire respiratory tract , result sinus , ear , lung disease . - Bronchiectasis continue significant problem develop country specific group individual , particularly people cystic fibrosis . Although treatment available development bronchiectasis relate cystic fibrosis , many disease-specific treatment may effective bronchiectasis relate cystic fibrosis . Objectives : - To study natural history bronchiectasis identify inherit immune factor may explain certain individual chronic recur infection . Eligibility : - Individuals 5 year age old establish diagnosis bronchiectasis history chronic/recurring respiratory infection . - Direct family member ( e.g. , parent , sibling , child ) patient study may also ask participate . Design : - Potential participant screen initial clinic evaluation full medical history , well general quality life respiratory symptom questionnaire . - The following standard procedure may do part study : air sample nose ; image study , may include x-ray computed tomography ( CT ) , lung function test ; collection sample blood , urine , sputum ( phlegm mucus ) . Other test may perform required researcher , explain patient need . - Both patient relative ( ask participate ) provide follow sample : blood buccal ( cheek swab ) cell genetic testing , sputum , urine . - To prevent infection potential disease progression , patient may receive standard medical care treatment bronchiectasis related infection protocol . - Patients older 18 year age invite join Bronchiectasis Research Registry , program support Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Foundation . The purpose program identify group people interested receive information research study focus bronchiectasis possibly participate research study . Participants may offer opportunity participate select clinic trial relate bronchiectasis relate medical condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis , abnormal dilation airway , condition typically characterize chronic recur respiratory tract infection . Frequently , depend underlying cause , infection involve entire respiratory tract result sinus , ear , lung disease . This condition use common child prior immunization childhood infection . It continue significant problem develop country specific group individual U.S. Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) commonly associate genetic condition tremendous stride make recent year understand mechanisms disease lead multitude emerge novel treatment strategy . The mechanisms cause bronchiectasis evolve degree , many disease-specific treatment assess cystic fibrosis may effective non-CF bronchiectasis . Often bronchiectasis associate chronic infection environmental germ nontuberculous mycobacteria . This protocol aim explore associate cause mechanisms development bronchiectasis patient chronic recur respiratory tract infection . Participants undergo test base individual clinical presentation look know associated condition . Additionally , patient may follow time well understand natural history evolve bronchiectasis ass effect management strategy course disease chronic infection like nontuberculous mycobacteria . As potential novel therapy develop , participant may offer opportunity participate clinical treatment trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Children age 5 year adults refer NIH chronic recur respiratory infection eligible participation . 2 . Males female consider without regard race ethnicity upper age limit . 3 . Emphasis primarily non CF bronchiectasis elucidation mechanism infection susceptibility . However , select patient cystic fibrosis acquire immune defect ( HIV ) may study relevant host defect suspect needed comparison purpose evaluate study management chronic pathogen associate condition nontuberculous mycobacterial infection allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis . 4 . Subjects must primary refer physician 5 . Subjects must willing sample store INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVES : As part protocol may obtain blood , sputum , urine , buccal swab blood relatives patient study , hope isolate characterize primary host defense defect ( ) genetic link responsible airway infection susceptibility and/or bronchiectasis see within family . Male female relative accept without limitation due age . These relative may pertinent diseaserelated history obtain , neither receive treatment protocol procedures do unless enrol study . PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . We wish avoid enrol subject , especially child , common respiratory problem ( aeroallergen sensitivity , asthma , gastric esophageal reflux ) associate underlying abnormality host defense . Evidence significance chronic recur infection suggestive underlying airway surface systemic host defense defect document one following : ) sinus low airway culture positive bacterial , fungal , mycobacterial pathogen characteristic defect ; b ) radiographic evidence sinusitis mucosal thicken and/or airfluid level ; c ) radiographic evidence bronchiectasis ; ) severity otitis medium require placement tympanic membrane pressure equalization tube ; e ) severity sinusitis require surgical intervention . 2 . Patients unable unwilling provide inform consent either directly via appropriately designate surrogate . 3 . Any patient , opinion Investigator , unable unwilling comply regular followup unlikely provide pertinent information regard disease progression response treatment may exclude longitudinal followup . 4 . Children age 5 exclude protocol . When pediatric subject reach age 18 , continue participation require reconsenting adult consent document .</criteria>
