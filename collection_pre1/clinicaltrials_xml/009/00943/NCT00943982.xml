	<brief_summary>Background : - Uveitis serious inflammatory condition affect eye cause vision loss . A common secondary problem associate uveitis macular edema ( swell ) . The macula part eye important central vision , swell macula lead vision loss . This condition usually treat medicine target immune system , medicine sometimes work may cause side effect . - Interferon gamma-1b ( Actimmune ( Registered Trademark ) ) bioengineered protein alter way inflammatory cell work immune system . Interferon gamma-1b give intramuscular injection ; however , study use drug eye drop . This study represent first time interferon gamma-1b give eye drop . Researchers hope interferon gamma-1b treat macular edema decrease swell back eye . Objectives : - To investigate safety effectiveness treat uveitis-associated macular edema interferon gamma-1b . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose macular edema associate uveitis ( one eye ) least 3 month . Design : - Participants three plan clinic visit study course 2 week . - All participant medical history eye examination . - When receive drop , participant optical coherence tomography ( detailed scan retina ) 60 minute 30 minute drop ; upon receive drop ; 30 , 60 , 120 minute receive drop . - After receive drop , participant another eye examination , blood drawn sample , scan . - Participants ask return NIH Clinical Center 1 week receive drop evaluation ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Information gather laboratory suggest cystoid macular edema ( CME ) cause disequilibrium Jak/Stat mTor signal transduction pathway retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) . We wish investigate whether stimulate Jak/Stat pathway topically apply interferon gamma-1b therapeutic intervention treatment CME secondary uveitis . The objective study investigate safety tolerability ocular instillation ( ) interferon gamma-1b effective treatment CME secondary uveitis . Study Population : Five participant CME secondary intermediate , panuveitis posterior uveitis receive topical ocular instillation ( ) interferon gamma-1b . Design : This Phase I , non-randomized , prospective , uncontrolled , dose-escalation , single-center study involve one-time instillation series instillation interferon gamma-1b cornea measure potential response optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Treatment success define 25 % decrease excess central macular thicken timepoint post-instillation compare baseline . The first two participant receive one instillation ( instillation contain 10 microg 0.05 mL solution ) , next two participant receive two instillation final participant receive three instillation . OCT obtain -60 minute , -30 minute instillation ( ) . Repeat OCTs take +30 minute , +60 minute +120 minute end day . All participant return one-week safety visit . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change excess central macular thickening measure OCT response interferon gamma-1b compare baseline . Secondary efficacy outcome include change macular volume measure OCT , visual acuity , intraocular pressure , intraocular inflammation grade upon slit lamp examination . Secondary safety outcome include ocular surface irritation assess fluorescein stain cornea conjunctiva ass toxicity change subjective ocular pain assessment compare baseline , number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event proportion participant visual loss great equal 15 ETDRS letter .</detailed_description>

Both female participant childbearing potential male participant able father child must agree practice adequate contraception study six week follow administration study medication . Acceptable method contraception include hormonal contraception ( i.e . birth control pill , inject hormone dermal patch vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation vasectomy ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant expect unable tolerate ocular instillation . 2 . Participant unable undergo OCT testing . 3 . Participant herpes keratitis past . 4 . Participant diagnose multiple sclerosis . 5 . Participant significant active infection ( infection require treatment determine medical team ) history chronic recurrent infection principal investigator 's best medical judgment would preclude participation .</criteria>
