	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide leuprolide acetate may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving everolimus together bicalutamide , leuprolide acetate , radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together bicalutamide leuprolide acetate treat patient high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer undergo radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus , Bicalutamide , Leuprolide Acetate Treating Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy For High-Risk Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess acute late toxicity patient high-risk , locally advanced prostate cancer . Secondary - To assess biochemical-free survival patient . - To assess metastasis-free survival patient . - To assess overall survival patient . - To assess molecular characteristic tumor treatment correlate outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients undergo radiotherapy prostate seminal vesicle daily , 5 day week , 7.5 week . Beginning week radiotherapy , patient receive oral bicalutamide daily 1 month oral everolimus twice daily 8.5 week . Beginning first week radiotherapy , patient receive leuprolide acetate subcutaneously every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
