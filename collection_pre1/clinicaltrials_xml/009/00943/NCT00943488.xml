	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety immune response ( body 's defense disease ) experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine healthy adult elderly population . The study enroll 450 healthy adult age 18 old history H1N1 infection vaccination . Two hundred individual 18-64 year old , 200 great equal 65 year age . Participants randomly assign 1 2 possible vaccine group : group 1 receive 15 microgram ( mcg ) H1N1 vaccine ; group 2 receive 30 mcg H1N1 vaccine . Both group receive vaccine injection day 0 21 arm muscle . Study procedures include : medical history , physical exam , maintain memory aid , blood sample collection .

	<brief_title>CSL H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Administered Two Dose Levels Adult Elderly Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . In addition , adult likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . The primary safety objective study assess safety unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine administer 15 30 microgram ( mcg ) dose . The primary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response follow single dose unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine , stratify age recipient , administer 15 30 mcg dose . The secondary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response follow 2 dos unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine , stratify age recipient , administer 15 30 mcg dose . Participants include 450 healthy adult age 18 old history novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase II study healthy male non-pregnant female design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine 2 dose level . Subjects randomize 2 dose group , stratify age ( 200 subject per dose group 100 subject per age stratum , 18-64 great equal 65 year age ) receive intramuscular inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 1 ) 30 mcg ( Group 2 ) . The H1N1 vaccine administer Day 0 Day 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive dos Day 21 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month post first vaccination ( Day 201 ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include HAI neutralize antibody test serum obtain day vaccination ( prior vaccination ) , Day 8-10 vaccination , 21 day follow second vaccination ( Day 42 ) .</detailed_description>
