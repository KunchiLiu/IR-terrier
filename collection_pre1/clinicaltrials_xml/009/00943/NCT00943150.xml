	<brief_summary>The objective clinical study evaluate healing incision make PEAK PlasmaBlade 4.0 compare scalpel traditional electrosurgery ( Bovie ) ; monitor record key post-operative metric follow abdominoplasty PEAK PlasmaBlade 4.0 versus current standard care ( SOC ) ; evaluate performance metric PEAK PlasmaBlade 4.0 abdominoplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEAK PlasmaBlade™ v . Traditional Electrosurgery Abdominoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominoplasty cosmetic surgical procedure perform correct abdominal elastosis skin fat redundancy . During procedure , scalpel traditional electrosurgical device use cut away excess skin fat abdomen underlie muscle tighten together suture . The PEAK PlasmaBlade™ use pulse radiofrequency ( RF ) energy enable precision cut coagulate point application , without thermal damage surround tissue normally see traditional electrosurgery . The PlasmaBlade receive FDA clearance use plastic , general , ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) surgery , demonstrate significantly reduce serous drainage tissue reduction surgery , like abdominoplasty . A total twenty ( 20 ) human subject recruit local community standardize inclusion/exclusion criterion . Once enrolled , patient underwent placement three set full-thickness comparison incision abdominal skin standard scalpel , PlasmaBlade , traditional electrosurgery six ( 6 ) three ( 3 ) week prior abdominoplasty , day surgery general anesthesia . Subjects randomize undergo abdominoplasty PlasmaBlade SOC ( scalpel traditional electrosurgery ) . Following abdominoplasty , harvest healed incision submit histological analysis burst strength test additional data record 10 day post-operative period .</detailed_description>
