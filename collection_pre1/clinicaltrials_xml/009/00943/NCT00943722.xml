	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immunogenicity tolerability V503 ( multivalent human papillomavirus [ HPV ] L1 virus-like particle [ VLP ] vaccine ) preadolescent adolescent participant 9 15 year old demonstrate consistency manufacture vaccine assessment 3 different final manufacturing process lot V503 . The primary hypothesis follow : 1 . The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine administer preadolescent adolescent boys girl 9 15 year age young woman 16 26 year age generally well-tolerated . 2 . 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune response preadolescent adolescent girl 9 15 year age seronegative Day 1 relevant HPV type compare young woman 16 26 year age seronegative Day 1 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -negative Day 1 Month 7 relevant HPV type , measure anti-HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 45 , 52 , 58 geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) 4 week post-dose 3 . 3 . The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune response preadolescent adolescent boy 9 15 year age seronegative Day 1 relevant HPV type compare young woman 16 26 year age seronegative Day 1 PCR-negative Day 1 Month 7 relevant HPV type , measure anti-HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 45 , 52 , 58 GMTs 4 week post-dose 3 . 4 . Three separate final manufacturing process ( FMP ) lot 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induce similar immune response , measure anti-HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 45 , 52 , 58 GMTs 4 week post-dose 3 .</brief_summary>
