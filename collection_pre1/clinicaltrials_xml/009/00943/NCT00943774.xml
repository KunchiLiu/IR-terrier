	<brief_summary>Baroreflex sensitivity integral blood pressure regulation , varies among healthy , normotensive individual . A reduced compensatory ability baroreflex buffering patient carotid denervation result blood pressure variability elevate blood pressure response mental stress . Furthermore , 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure variability may also significant independent risk determinant cardiovascular disease . It remain unknown whether degree baroreflex sensitivity ambulatory blood pressure variability predictive pressor response sympathoexcitatory stress healthy human . In study investigator propose comprehensive evaluation relationship among pressor forearm vasodilator response sympathoexcitation , ambulatory blood pressure variability , baroreflex sensitivity healthy normotensive subject . Ultimately study provide preliminary data protocol development large-scale high resolution phenotyping population-based trial aim determine functional relevance candidate gene variation intermediate physiological trait pertinent pathogenesis hypertension cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growing evidence suggest association environmental stress development hypertension strong evidence normotensive subject great pressor response sympathoexcitatory stress harbinger future hypertension . Pharmacological study show individual HTN blunt baroreflex sensitivity , display great increase blood pressure administration alpha-agonist . Furthermore , exaggerate 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure variability ( BPV ) propose risk factor development cardiovascular disease . Finally , Beta-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated forearm vasodilator response mental stress blunt Caucasian subject increase risk hypertension , African Americans , mild hypertension . We postulate relationship exists variable , even normotensive healthy individual . We also believe sign subclinical metabolic dysfunction exist healthy individual may either contribute affect BPV . There also evidence prematurity birth low birth weight associate hypertension . Finally , arterial stiffness may also relate blood pressure variability pressor response . Therefore specific aim study : 1 . To examine relationship 24-hour ambulatory BPV baroreflex sensitivity . By measure baroreflex control heart rate sequential bolus nitroprusside phenylephrine , hypothesize baroreflex sensitivity inversely related degree 24-hour BPV . 2 . To examine relationship 24-hour ambulatory BPV pressor response four sympathoexcitatory maneuver : head-up tilt testing , mental stress , cold pressor test , isometric handgrip fatigue . We hypothesize great BPV predict pressor response stress . 3 . To examine relationship baroreflex sensitivity pressor response/forearm vasodilator response three sympathoexcitatory maneuver . We hypothesize individual higher baroreflex sensitivity lower pressor response lower forearm vasodilator response sympathoexcitatory stress . 4 . To draw venous blood sample future screen genetic polymorphism interest , may include nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , alpha-adrenergic beta-adrenergic receptor polymorphism . We hypothesize genetic variation key regulatory system might explain difference baroreflex sensitivity , BPV , pressor response forearm vasodilator response sympathoexcitation . 5 . To examine relationship 24-hour ambulatory BPV pressor response sympathoexcitatory maneuver insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , body fat distribution . We hypothesize great BPV associate insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , increase waist-hip ratio . 6 . To examine relationship 24-hour ambulatory BPV arterial stiffness use measurement pulse wave velocity . We hypothesize great BPV associate increase pulse wave velocity , index arterial stiffness . 7 . To examine relationship 24-hour ambulatory BPV pressor response sympathoexcitatory maneuver birth weight post-conceptual age birth . We ask subject provide data base birth certificate and/or knowledge medical history .</detailed_description>
