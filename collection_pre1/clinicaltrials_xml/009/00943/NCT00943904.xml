	<brief_summary>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) implantation minimally invasive procedure current FDA approval urinary urge incontinence , urgency-frequency syndrome non-obstructive urinary retention , available United States since 1997 . The SNS delivers non-painful , mild electrical pulse sacral nerve modulate reflex influence bladder , sphincter , pelvic floor improve restore normal void function . While SNS show efficacy aforementioned condition , exact mechanism action unknown , believed work primarily somatic afferent system promote inhibitory reflex pathway facilitate urine storage . The degree stimulation think level evokes sensory motor response ; however test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SNS involve two-stage procedure . The initial phase consider test stimulation period patient allow evaluate whether therapy effective controlling symptom . There two technique exist perform test stimulation . The first office-based procedure term percutaneous nerve evaluation ( PNE ) . This involve place temporary electrode wire S3 sacral foramen local anesthesia . The wire secure tape connect external generator patient wear trial period 3-7 day . If patient least 50 % improvement symptoms test phase , candidate chronic implant lead implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) . The advantage PNE incision free procedure perform office utilize local anesthesia , require hospitalization . The disadvantage come fact wire securely anchored place , propensity migrate away nerve physical activity . The second alternative know stag implant introduce Spinelli 2003 ( 15,16 ) This typically performed outpatient procedure use local anesthesia , intravenous sedation , intra-operative fluoroscopy . This procedure involve placement chronic quadripolar lead wire adjacent sacral nerve root ( typically S3 ) . The lead self-anchoring therefore reduce potential migration . The patient go test phase last 7-21 day . The advantage technique allow longer trial period minimal risk lead migration . The chronic wire also 4 electrode trialed active electrode achieve optimal improvement patient ' symptom . In addition , 2nd stage , final implant previously place tined-lead remain place simply connect IPG . This eliminate chance variable lead placement test implantation phase . The disadvantage stag implant require two visit operate room may costly health care system . However , prospective study compare PNE stag implant , significantly high rate conversion implant stag procedure vs. PNE ( 88 % vs.46 % ) . In addition , infection rate higher stag implant compare PNE ( 17 ) .</detailed_description>
