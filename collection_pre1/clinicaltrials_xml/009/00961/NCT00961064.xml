	<brief_summary>Background : - Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) bone marrow disorder characterize anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ( low red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet count ) . Patients MDS risk symptomatic anemia , infection , bleeding , well risk progression acute leukemia . Standard treatment MDS significant relapse rate . MDS patient thrombocytopenia fail standard therapy require regular , expensive , inconvenient platelet transfusion , risk serious bleed complication . - Eltrombopag drug design mimic protein thrombopoietin , cause body make platelet . Eltrombopag able increase platelet count healthy volunteer patient chronic ITP ( disease patient destroy platelet rapidly thus develop thrombocytopenia ) , researcher know drug increase platelet count patient MDS . Objectives : - To find whether eltrombopag improve platelet count patient MDS . - To determine whether eltrombopag safe patient MDS . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old consistently low blood platelet count related MDS respond conventional treatment . Design : - Treatment eltrombopag tablet per day 90 day . - Participants monitor closely throughout initial treatment , weekly blood test separate evaluation National Institutes Health ( NIH ) treatment center every 4 week . Bone marrow biopsy may conduct check abnormality bone marrow . - If patient show sign improve platelet count 90 day , treatment continue additional dos eltrombopag . - Patients discontinue take eltrombopag evaluate NIH treatment center 4 week end treatment , 6 month end treatment check potential side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist , Eltrombopag , Patients With Low Int-2 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) bone marrow disorder characterize anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia . Patients MDS risk symptomatic anemia , infection , bleeding , well variable risk progression acute leukemia . With exception stem cell transplant , standard treatment MDS rarely curative , relapse rate significant . MDS patient cytopenias fail standard therapy require regular blood platelet transfusion expensive inconvenient , risk serious bleed complication . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) principal regulator platelet production megakaryocytes bone marrow . A 2nd generation TPO-agonist , eltrombopag ( Promacta ) show increase platelet thrombocytopenic patient chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) . Eltrombopag administer orally , well-tolerated , FDA approve treatment thrombocytopenia patient chronic ITP fail respond standard treatment . Because management MDS patient persistent cytopenia remain unsatisfactory novel therapeutic approach need , propose non-randomized , pilot , phase II study eltrombopag low Int-2 risk MDS subject thrombocytopenia anemia cytopenia either untreated cytopenia persist despite treatment standard therapy assess utility setting . Subjects initiate study medication oral dose 50 mg/day ( 25 mg/day East Asians ) , adjust clinically indicated low dose maintains stable platelet count great equal 20,000/microL baseline maximize tolerability . Treatment response increase cytopenia , lineage fulfil eligibility criterion enrollment define : ( ) platelet count increase 20,000/microL baseline 16 20 week , stable platelet count transfusion independence minimum 8 week subject previously transfusion dependent ; ( b ) erythroid response subject pretreatment hemoglobin le 9 g/dL define increase hemoglobin great equal 1.5g/dL without pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfusion support , reduction unit PRBC transfusion least 50 % eight consecutive week prior response assessment compare pretreatment transfusion number previous 8 week ; ( c ) neutrophil response define pretreatment absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L least 100 % increase absolute increase &gt; 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L . Subjects meet response may remain extended access meet study criterion study close . Subjects response 16 20 week may consent entry extended access part trial . In event subject transfuse platelet count &gt; 10,000/microL without medical indication study period , subject may continue study drug response assessment may extend additional 4 week week 20 , discretion principal investigator . Subjects evidence clinical response lineage 16 week yet meet full primary endpoint response criterion , tolerate investigational treatment , may receive additional 4 week eltrombopag reassess 20 week . At time , meet primary endpoint response criterion , eligible enter extend access part study . If meet primary endpoint response criterion , eltrombopag discontinue . Primary objective ass efficacy eltrombopag patient low Int-2 risk MDS . Safety eltrombopag subject population assess concurrently . Secondary objective include toxicity profile extend treatment eltrombopag ( treatment longer 4 month ) , reduction incidence severity bleed episode , response follow extended access study drug ( treatment longer 4 month ) . The primary endpoint portion drug responder define change platelet count and/or platelet transfusion requirement , proportion subject meet erythroid response , neutrophil response criteria.. Platelet response define platelet count increase 20,000/microL baseline 16 20 week , stable platelet count transfusion independence minimum 8 week . Erythroid response subject pretreatment hemoglobin le 9 g/dL define increase hemoglobin great equal 1.5g/dL without pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfusion support , reduction unit PRBC transfusion least 50 % eight consecutive week prior response assessment compare pretreatment transfusion number previous 8 week . Neutrophil response define pretreatment absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L least 100 % increase absolute increase &gt; 0.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L . Subjects erythroid , and/or neutrophil response 16 week may continue study medication ( extended access ) meet study criterion . Subjects erythroid , neutrophil response 16 week may continue study medication additional 4 week ( ensure eligibility ) prior consent entry extend access part trial . Patients may remain extended access meet study criterion . The toxicity profile measure use CTCAE Version 4.0 criterion . Secondary endpoint include incidence grade 2 high bleeding event measure CTCAE v. 4.0 ; change serum thrombopoietin level , measure 4 month ; progression high risk MDS measure IWG criterion .</detailed_description>
