	<brief_title>OsseoFix™ Spinal Fracture Reduction System Treating Spinal Compression Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center clinical study design evaluate safety effectiveness OsseoFix Spinal Fracture Reduction System use PMMA bone cement relative clinical expectation treatment vertebral compression fracture ( VCFs ) . The study conduct 15 investigational center United States 115 ( 125 ) subject one two vertebral compression fracture level T6 L5 implant investigational device ( ) . Baseline screening complete determine eligible subject . VCFs confirm magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , CT / bone scan . These diagnostic test utilize confirm retropulsed bone fragment . Subjects meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion schedule receive OsseoFix Spinal Fracture Reduction System . Subjects enrol implanted OsseoFix Spinal Fracture Reduction System postero-lateral approach anterior vertebral body use instrument specifically design procedure . Radiographs take follow-up visit , include baseline post-operatively . Subject 's perception pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Functional outcome measure use Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) Short Form- 36 ( SF-36 ) questionnaires well neurologic status . The VAS , ODI , SF-36 neurologic status measure baseline , 4-week , 3-month , 6-month 12-month follow-up visit . Overall patient-satisfaction evaluate post-implant scheduled follow-up visit . Adverse event record schedule non-scheduled visit . The endpoint analysis perform submit implanted subject complete 12-months follow-up .</detailed_description>
