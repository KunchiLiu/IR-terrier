	<brief_title>Indigo Carmine Staining Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) Colonic Mucosa Detection Dysplasia Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Primary : 1 . To assess intra- inter-observer agreement detection abnormality see white light colonoscopy follow indigo carmine stain white light colonoscopy follow NBI image . Secondary : 2 . To estimate sensitivity specificity modality dysplasia among UC patient undergo surveillance colonoscopy . 3 . To assess intra- inter-observer agreement abnormality identify confocal laser microscopy among patient chronic ulcerative colitis . 4 . To determine specificity sensitivity confocal microscopy detection dysplasia among patient ulcerative colitis . 50 consecutive patient clinically quiescent UC present surveillance colonoscopy randomize white light follow NBI OR white light follow indigo carmine staining . Identified abnormality target confocal image 40 patient . Immediately prior confocal imaging , fluorescein 2.5 ml 10 % solution administer intravenously . For patient , confocal image also obtain area around lesion colon segment parent study correlate pathology . Gross activity determine white light colonoscopy colon segment . At least 32 biopsy surveillance obtain additional biopsy abnormality present white light , NBI indigo carmine . Photographs obtain abnormality prior biopsy random mucosa without abnormality . Intra- inter-observer agreement base first 10 patient site review de-identified endoscopic photograph . If modification necessary poor agreement , re-assessment make next 10 patient . Otherwise site enroll 40 additional patient agreement summarize sensitivity specificity technique detect dysplasia Significance : If intra inter-observer agreement mucosal abnormality detect indigo carmine NBI modality show good , ulcerative colitis , large study plan UC surveillance population . If confocal technique feasible integrated large study .</detailed_description>
