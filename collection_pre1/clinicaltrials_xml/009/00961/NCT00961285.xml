	<detailed_description>The investigator use several approach identify common genetic variation : single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , genomic insertion deletion , genetic copy number variation ( CNVs ) , interchromosomal translocation , loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) , uniparental disomy ( UPD ) , Epigenetic change , silence gene expression via DNA hypermethylation , also influence drug effect , aberrant methylation CpG islands common feature cancer cell . Over year , method cytogenetic analysis evolve become part routine laboratory testing , provide valuable diagnostic prognostic information hematologic disorder . The recently develop single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array offer ability define simultaneously copy number change loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) event occur tumor , high resolution throughout genome . In addition information copy number change , SNP array allow u investigate impact high number SNPs drug response toxicity This molecular integrated approach lead identification alteration potentially involve complex mechanism leukemogenesis identification validation novel biological factor may serve predictor drug-response drug-resistance may suitable targeted therapy .</detailed_description>
