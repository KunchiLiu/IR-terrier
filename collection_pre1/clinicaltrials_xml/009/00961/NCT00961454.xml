	<brief_title>Photobiomodulation Alter Cerebral Blood Flow Affect Emotional Status Patients With Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We wish study whether photobiomodulation ( PBM ) near infrared ( NIR ) light emit diode ( LED ) , non-ionizing phototherapy , patient major depression , acutely alter frontal brain blood flow measure near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Secondarily , examine whether PBM improve emotional state immediately follow month . We see pilot study gather preliminary data guide future study .</detailed_description>
