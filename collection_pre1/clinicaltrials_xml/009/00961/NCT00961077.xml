	<brief_summary>Stomach cancer common malignant disease second common cause cancer-related death Korea . The elderly primarily affect disease gastric cancer-related death occur patient age 65 year old . Systemic chemotherapy improve quantity quality life patient gastric cancer compare best supportive care . However , elderly cancer patient often present concomitant co-morbidities age-associated physiologic problem make selection optimal treatment difficult . There also uncertainty use systemic palliative chemotherapy elderly patient representation age group clinical trial . Therefore , phase II trial plan investigate efficacy toxicity combination chemotherapy attenuate dose S-1 oxaliplatin ( attenuated SOX ) patient elderly AGC</brief_summary>
