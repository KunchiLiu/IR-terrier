	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose carmustine give together O6-benzylguanine see well work treat patient stage IA-IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , carmustine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . O6-benzylguanine may help carmustine work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving O6-benzylguanine carmustine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>O6-Benzylguanine Topical Carmustine Treating Patients With Early-Stage IA-IIA Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma ( CTCL ) response rate safety O6BG ( O6-benzylguanine ) /BCNU ( carmustine ) give biweekly two consecutive daily dos . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine laboratory correlate clinical response drug efficacy base upon O6-alkylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) alkyltransferase ( AGT ) activity CTCL lesion examine determine effect consecutive day O6BG administration extent duration AGT depletion . II . To determine laboratory correlate clinical response drug efficacy base upon degree induction apoptosis cell cycle arrest examine malignant T-cell population lymphomatous tissue constitutive cell skin determine drug efficacy toxicity immunohistochemical technique . III . To determine laboratory correlate clinical response drug efficacy base upon O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) gene mutation change AGT expression examine potential mechanism O6BG resistance non-responding patient . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study carmustine follow phase II study . Patients receive O6-benzylguanine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour apply topical carmustine total skin surface ( exclude lip , eyelid , ulcerated lesion ) 1 hour complete O6-benzylguanine infusion day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
