	<detailed_description>Screening ( Visit 1 ) Run-in Period This period study design 8-week screening stabilization period , potentially eligible subject participate weight-maintaining diet daily exercise program . Subjects eligible screen diabetic subject treat solely diet exercise mildly elevate HbA1c level otherwise good health suffer serious complication diabetes . At end screen visit , potentially eligible study subject instruct follow weight-maintaining diet daily exercise program . They give blank subject diary nutritional diary , schedule second visit ( Visit 2 ) 8 week stabilization . Randomization Visit ( Visit 2 ) At Visit 2 , prior randomization , qualify study subject follow baseline procedure perform : complete medical evaluation include review medical history change since Visit 1 physical examination , blood drawn clinical laboratory test . Randomization stratify site baseline HbA1c level ( &lt; 7.5 % ≥ 7.5 % ) obtain balanced distribution subject across three arm trial . Subjects receive sufficient supply study medication last next visit . Additionally , subject receive diary diary completion instruction record side effect , intercurrent illnesses/symptoms , concomitant medication . One Two Month Maintenance Visits ( Visit 3 Visit 4 ) At visit , subject return clinic diary assessment , blood test , study drug compliance assessment dispensation additional study drug . Subjects blood drawn clinical laboratory test include hematology panel , chemistry panel , creatinine clearance , insulin level , liver function test , lipid profile , HbA1c level , urinalysis . Six Month , End Study Visit ( Visit 5 ) During final visit , assessment conduct Visits 3 4 repeat . Additionally , final physical examination conduct . Treatments Administered There 3 minimal-dose D-tagatose treatment group trial : 2.5 g tid , 5.0 g tid , 7.5 g tid . The duration treatment group 6 month . Timing Doses Each Subject The tid dosage regimen ( i.e. , dose prior meal ) select order standardize fast status time dose administration across subject . The treatment duration 6 month determine sufficient evaluate efficacy safety three dosage Phase 2 trial . DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE The procedure perform assure proper conduct trial assure accurate , consistent , complete , reliable report data collect trial . Before study initiation periodically study , monitor visit investigational site . A study initiation meeting hold investigative site enrollment first subject review study design , study procedure , data collection , investigator responsibility . During interim field monitor visit , monitor verify CRF entry available source document ensure appropriate data collect documented . Frequent telephone contact study site maintain throughout study , copy write correspondence investigator , sponsor , IRBs file sponsor investigator . Data collect investigational center respect anonymity subject . Prior data entry , CRFs check completeness consistency monitor verify source documentation maintain study site . Data CRF enter relational database ( Sequel ) via optical character recognition , subsequently verify versus CRF two independent data entry clerk . Any discrepancy interpretation data hard copy CRF refer lead data manager either resolve discrepancy review CRF refer discrepancy study site resolution . Subsequent data verification process , programmed validation run conduct regular interval check logic , consistency , validity verify data . Inconsistencies data logic refer study center resolution via data clarification form ( DCF ) , require investigator signature . Data collection quality assurance/control electronically transmit laboratory data handle accord respective laboratory 's standard procedure transmission CRO analysis . Programmed validation run central laboratory data versus information CRF perform discrepancy reconcile study site central laboratory . Prior data lock final analysis , follow quality control procedures perform . - An audit CRF resolve query versus analysis data perform 100 % subject primary endpoint , demographic , end study finding , randomization information . All error find audit report lead data manager correct . - An audit remain CRF data ( primary endpoint , demographic , end study finding , randomization information ) perform randomly select 10 % subject . If error rate exceed 0.5 % , systematic random sample additional 10 % subject repeat . A final audit report memo summarize audit finding generate give lead data manager file CRO . Data analysis perform primarily Statistical Analysis System ( SAS® ) software , version 9.0 high . SAS analysis datasets crosschecked locked database and/or CRF . Data summary table crosschecked SAS analysis datasets . All identified inconsistency report lead statistician resolve prior production report . This clinical study report check accuracy consistency sign-off . This check consist verification report text report synopsis , crosscheck textual information provide report synopsis versus source summary table , data listing , report appendix . Statistical Analytical Plan The CRO prepare statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) efficacy safety data database lock . The SAP finalize December 6 , 2010 . Analysis Populations The three analysis population define SAP , along respective definition intend use provide . The main efficacy analysis conduct use ITT population . The ITT population include subject sign ICF , receive protocol-specified treatment , baseline least one post-baseline HbA1c value . The Efficacy Evaluable ( EE ) population use supportive efficacy analysis . The EE population consist randomized subject complete 6-month treatment period , major protocol violation eligibility violation . All protocol violation identify prior break blind . The safety population consist randomized subject receive least one dose study medication least one post-treatment visit safety assessment . This population use safety summary . Statistical Method Details Data summary prepare treatment group population whole ( i.e. , treatment group combine ) . The descriptive statistic provide data summary table involve continuous data include number observation , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum value . The descriptive statistic provide data summary table involve categorical data include frequency count percentage . Inferential statistic provide efficacy endpoint . Duration Exposure Study Drug The duration ( day ) study drug dosing estimate summarize descriptively Safety Population dose group dos combine . Duration base entry CRF calculate last dose date minus first dose date plus one day [ ( last dose date - first dose date ) + 1 day ] . If medication stop date miss stop date specify continue , end study date , record CRF , use stop date duration determination . Compliance Percent compliance study medication calculate [ ( total unit drug return minus total unit drug dispense ) ÷ total dispense ] time 100 % . Resulting data summarize descriptively Safety population dose group dose combine . Efficacy Analyses All efficacy endpoint summarize descriptively dose group dos combine ITT EE population . All statistical test comparison dose group two-sided test , p-value adjustment . The ITT EE population use analysis efficacy . Safety Analyses The Safety Population use analysis safety tolerability . All safety parameter present descriptively data listing . No inferential statistic plan perform safety data . Adverse Events : The number percentage subject report AE summarize descriptively MedDRA System Organ Class ( SOC ) Preferred Term ( PT ) , Version 10.0 , dose group . Adverse event SAEs occur randomization last study visit summarize . Unless otherwise specify , incidence unique event provide AE summarization ( i.e. , subject count unique event occur summary ) . For summary AEs severity , subject one event per MedDRA SOC PT , bad severity tabulate . Similarly , summary AEs causality , subject one event per MedDRA SOC PT , bad severity tabulate . Additionally , summary AEs lead study drug discontinuation provide . Hypoglycemic Episodes : All subject experience one event cod MedDRA PT `` hypoglycemia '' include summary AEs ( see ) . Gastrointestinal Side Effects : Categorical summary responses question GSRS prepare base time point dose group . Additionally , subject experience one event cod MedDRA SOC `` Gastrointestinal Disorders '' include summary AEs ( see ) . Determination Sample Size The sample size calculation base reduction least 0.5 % HbA1c level 6 month study treatment compare baseline dose group , standard deviation 1.0 treatment group , 80 % statistical power two-sided analysis Type I error rate 0.05 . The required number evaluable subject 102 ( 34 D-tagatose dose group ) base nQuery Advisor , version 6.01 . A total 40 subject per treatment group ( 120 subject study ) recruit , expect observe 15 % drop rate study population , total 150 subject ( 50 per treatment group ) screen base estimate screen failure rate 20 % .</detailed_description>
