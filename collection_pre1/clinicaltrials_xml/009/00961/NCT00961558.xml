	<brief_title>Canadian Varicocelectomy Initiative ( CVI ) : Effects Male Fertility Testicular Function Varicocelectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : A varicocele common detectable factor infertile men ( find approximately 40 % men infertility ) varicocelectomy commonly perform surgery treat male infertility . Despite large body literature demonstrate beneficial effect varicocele repair male fertility potential , significant controversy true effect varicocelectomy mainly due paucity randomize trial . The present controversy lead many clinician dismiss diagnosis ( varicocele ) altogether instead , offer alternative treatment couple . These alternative therapy include variety unnatural , invasive costly assist reproductive technique vitro fertilization . In-vitro fertilization widespread use world : 2002 117,000 IVF cycle perform USA 1 % newborns country conceive IVF . One major indication use IVF male factor infertility . The number infertile couple ( man varicocele ) presently treat assist reproduction unknown , probably least high undergoing varicocelectomy . Approximately 4500 varicocele repair perform Canada yearly ( reference : Canadian Health Institute ) . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial surgical treatment clinically detect varicocele determine varicocelectomy result improve fertility compare observation alone . This answer question utility role varicocelectomy management infertile men varicocele . RESEARCH QUESTIONS : 1 . Primary Question : Among infertile men clinically detectable varicocele , varicocelectomy improve pregnancy rate 6-month period compare observation alone ? 2 . Secondary Questions : 1 . Among infertile men clinically detectable varicocele , varicocelectomy improve sperm parameter ( concentration , motility , DNA integrity ) 6-month period compare observation alone ? 2 . Among infertile men clinically detectable varicocele , varicocelectomy increase serum testosterone level 6-month period compare observation alone ? 3 . What rate post-operative complication ( recurrence , clinical hydrocele formation testicular atrophy ) varicocelectomy ? 4 . What average time ( day ) work varicocelectomy ? DESIGN ARCHITECTURE : The investigator propose conduct multi-centered , randomize control trial compare varicocelectomy observation alone infertile men moderate large , clinically detectable varicocele . ACCRUAL AND DURATION OF STUDY : To identify 10 % difference pregnancy rate varicocelectomy control group enroll total 300 men ( randomize immediate surgical varicocelectomy observation alone ) follow men 6 month . We anticipate complete recruitment 3 year . Limiting study 6 ( rather 12 ) month encourage couple participate ethically responsible era effective alternative therapy ( e.g . IVF ) available . SIGNIFICANCE : The demonstration varicocelectomy superior , , observation alone great impact treatment male infertility treatment infertile couple whole . In addition , result study would tremendous financial impact Canadian Health Care . The result would allow appropriate use present treatment resource least 10,000 couple annually Canada . The result study would also impact management infertile couple worldwide .</detailed_description>
