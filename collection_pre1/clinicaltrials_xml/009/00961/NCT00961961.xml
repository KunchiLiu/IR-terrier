	<brief_title>Prevention Relapse &amp; Recurrence Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrence Bipolar I ( BP I ) major depressive episode ( MDE ) , recognize major mental health problem . Recurrent BP I MDE disorder satisfactory therapy , treatment remain challenge clinician . To date , initial long-term therapy BP I MDE base un-validated practice guideline . These guideline recommend limit antidepressant drug ( AD ) use initial therapy BP I MDE , completely avoid AD use long-term therapy . There , however , empirical evidence suggest mood stabilizer ( MS ) monotherapy superior combine MS plus AD therapy prevent recurrent BP I MDE . Nor evidence suggest long-term MS plus AD therapy result manic switch episode . We present evidence AD-induced mania long-term therapy BP I MDE over-estimated , long-term use MS plus AD therapy may superior MS therapy alone prevent recurrent BP I MDE . In study , ask : `` Does continuation therapy combine lithium plus fluoxetine result few MDE relapse recurrence vs. lithium monotherapy ? '' To answer question , patient BP I MDE receive combine lithium plus fluoxetine therapy 8 week . Responders stay well additional 4 week consolidation therapy randomize double-blind continuation therapy either ( ) combine lithium plus fluoxetine , ( ii ) lithium alone ( follow fluoxetine taper discontinuation ) additional 50 week . We hypothesize long-term lithium plus fluoxetine therapy result few MDE relapse recurrence vs. lithium monotherapy . We also ask : `` What relative safety , tolerability , frequency syndromal sub-syndromal manic , hypomanic , mixed state conversion continuation treatment combine lithium plus fluoxetine vs. lithium monotherapy ? '' To answer question , measure : frequency , severity , duration syndromal sub-syndromal manic , hypomanic , mixed state conversion ; frequency , severity , duration treatment-emergent adverse event ; frequency treatment discontinuation ; time onset first syndromal sub-syndromal conversion event ; time first treatment intervention syndromal sub-syndromal conversion event ; , time onset increase suicidal ideation event . We hypothesize lithium plus fluoxetine therapy result similar frequency syndromal sub-syndromal conversion event , similar frequency treatment-emergent adverse event . We hypothesize lithium plus fluoxetine therapy result few suicide ideation event few study discontinuation vs. lithium monotherapy . We believe result trial may important public health impact current practice guideline treat BP I MDE .</detailed_description>
