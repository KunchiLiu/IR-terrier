	<brief_summary>The diagnosis monitor clinically-significant pathology knee remain challenging , unknown injury become painful respond surgical intervention . The limitation diagnostic magnetic resonance image result arthroscopy always beneficial . Elucidation biochemical pathway underlie pain condition may aid patient selection surgery provide pharmacotherapeutic target . Cytokines novel yet uncharacterized protein may involve pain follow meniscus injury diagnostic cytokine assay may help physicians differentiate patient may benefit arthroscopy may . Additionally , evaluate post-operative biochemical profile may provide method monitor surgical outcome understand post-operative continuation remission pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lavage operative contralateral knee comparison perform anesthesia prior arthroscopy infusion 10cc sterile saline knee joint follow immediate withdrawal syringe , storage -80°C tube contain protease inhibitor . At 12wk post-operative 10cc lavage perform knee underwent surgery . Clinical finding sample quantify use gold-standard symptom severity questionnaire . The specimen analyze 31 potential biomarkers use multiplexed immunoassay panel , result compare pre- post-operative clinical finding radiographic image . Plans currently include microarray analysis , may later include .</detailed_description>
