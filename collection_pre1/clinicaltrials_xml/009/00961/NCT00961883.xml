	<detailed_description>In order halt HIV pandemic effective vaccine must develop . In study , investigator examine safety immune response prime-boost strategy use two different vaccine regimen , NYVAC-B rAd5 . Eighty participant recruit study . Participants randomly assign one four different group ( study arm ) . Each group receive study vaccine placebo different time . All NYVAC-B vaccine dos , dos rAD5 vaccine differ group group . Some participant group receive placebo . Participants visit study clinic 13 time course 12 month contact follow-up 4 year . All study injection give upper arm area . There total four injection course study . After injection , participant need stay clinic least 25 minute check adverse reaction . Additionally , participant need monitor health even injection next three evening , take temperature make note noticed side effect . Tools provide accomplish task . During day follow injection , study investigator need maintain contact participant ( participant specify best mode contact ) . Certain clinical procedure perform course study include regular HIV test counseling , physical exam , collection blood urine , pregnancy test applicable , question health medication , question HIV risk sexual behavior , personal problem benefit participant may experience participate study .</detailed_description>
