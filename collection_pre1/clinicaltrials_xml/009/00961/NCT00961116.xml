	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Fenofibric Acid Versus Tricor® ( Fenofibrate )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fenofibrate rapidly completely hydrolyze fenofibric acid , active moiety . The primary objective study evaluate bioequivalence fenofibric acid fenofibrate fasting condition . Additionally , safety tolerability study treatment evaluate . Fifty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , 18-45 year old , male female volunteer randomly assign crossover fashion receive two dose regimen , fenofibric acid ( Fibricor™ ) fenofibrate ( Tricor® ) sequence 7 day washout period dose period . On morning Day 1 , overnight fast least 10 hour , subject receive either single oral dose test formulation , fenofibric acid ( 1 x 105 mg tablet ) single oral dose reference formulation , fenofibrate ( 1 x 145 mg tablet ) . After 7 day washout period , morning Day 8 overnight fast , subject receive alternate regimen . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 72 hour post dose time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics fenofibric acid fenofibrate . Subjects monitor throughout participation adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Seated blood pressure pulse measure prior dose approximately 2 hour post-dose . All adverse experience , whether elicit query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff , document subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
