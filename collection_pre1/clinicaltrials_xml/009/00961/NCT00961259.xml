	<detailed_description>This study evaluate pharmacokinetic linearity single 35 mg fenofibric acid dose demonstrate bioequivalence three 35 mg fenofibric acid tablet ( 105 mg total single dose ) single 105 mg fenofibric acid tablet healthy adult volunteer dose administer fasted condition . Fifty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , 18-45 year old , male female volunteer randomly assign crossover fashion receive three fenofibric acid dose regimen sequence 7 day washout period dose period . On morning first day dose period , overnight fast least 10 hour , subject receive single dos fenofibric acid ( 1 x 35 mg tablet ) , fenofibric acid ( 3 x 35 mg tablet - 105 mg total dose ) , fenofibric acid ( 1 x 105 mg tablet ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose administration . Blood sample draw participant prior dose 72 hour post-dose , time sufficient adequately define fenofibric acid pharmacokinetics . Subjects monitor throughout participation adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Seated blood pressure pulse measure prior dose approximately 2 hour dose coincide peak plasma concentration . All adverse experience , whether elicit query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff , document subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
