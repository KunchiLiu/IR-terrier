	<brief_summary>Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) emerge novel noninvasive technique assessment airway inflammation , provide information airway line fluid composition . Traditionally , assessment relies invasive diagnostic tool bronchial biopsy bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) obtain specimens airway uncomfortable procedure especially young patient . The aim study evaluate effect allergic disease , disease monitoring exposure tobacco smoke airway inflammation measure marker exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) child asthma allergic house dust mite . Also , aim ass correlation cytokine concentration EBC clinical characteristic patient exercise-induced bronchoconstriction another phenotype asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Usefulness Exhaled Breath Condensate Evaluation Markers Airway Inflammation Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Markers identify EBC patient asthma include pH , hydrogen peroxide , nitrogen oxide , eicosanoids , isoprostanes , adenosine , certain cytokine , chemokines , growth factor . Concentrations biomarkers influence inflammation , oxidative stress , modulate therapeutic intervention . There evidence marker EBC differ patient asthma control , correlate asthma severity score , lung function . The aim study evaluate effect allergic disease , disease monitoring exposure tobacco smoke airway inflammation measure marker exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) child asthma allergic house dust mite . We also evaluate effect antiasthmatic treatment apply dust season number exacerbation `` asthma epidemic '' September . We evaluate effect exposure tobacco smoke antiasthmatic treatment . Also , aim ass correlation cytokine concentration EBC clinical characteristic patient exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) another phenotype asthma . At first study vist patient EIB underwent fractional exhale nitric oxide measurement ( FeNO ) baseline spirometry , perform exercise treadmill challenge ( ETC ) EBC sample obtain end ETC .</detailed_description>
