	<brief_summary>This study hypothesize radius subject mechanical loading may affect excitability alpha motor neuron innervate muscle , base bone mineral density . If hypothesis valid , firstly suggest relationship bone mineral density muscle strength bidirectional . A total 80 voluntary plan include study . After forearm vibration apply , bone mineral density ( BMD ) bone mineral content ( BMC ) measure case . Alpha motor neuron excitability ( H/M ratio , recruitment ) , background muscle activity evaluate electromyography pre-treatment , post-treatment , treatment case . Forearm vibration apply forearm vibration device ( FAV ) . FAV mechanical loading apply forearm . Cases sit armchair . Two interval FAV apply frequency 45 Hz . Each interval consist 60 second FAV follow rest . The right radius BMD BMC evaluate bone densitometer ( GE-LUNAR DPX PRO ) . Motor unite potential rest , Hoffman reflex , F response , M response measure electromyography right flexor carpus radialis . Medtronic Keypoint Portable 2 channel electromyography Neurotrac ETS device use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It usually report parallelism change bone structure function muscle structure function . Sarcopenia frequently observe osteoporotic patient . Bone formation increase bone resorption decrease exercise . To date , effect bone muscle activity investigate . One important function bone bear mechanical load include body weight . Bone must strong enough resist mechanical loading . Mechanisms need protect bone bone subject excessive mechanical loading . These mechanism may mainly focus strengthen bone and/or change vectorial property mechanical load applied bone . The vectorial property mechanical load applied bone may control muscle contraction . Bone contain wide mechanoreceptor net construct osteocyte . So , distribution mechanical load bone cross-sectional area possible perceive . It may also possible inappropriate distribution mechanical load bone crosssectional area optimize muscle contraction . To get regulation , mechanism muscle activity control central nervous system base mechanical load distribution bone cross-sectional area . We previously show bone regulate muscle activity , base bone mineral density . According study result , suggest may exist mechanism bone sense mechanical stimulus send signal central nervous system neuronally regulate muscle activity ( bone myo-regulation reflex ) . ( It also well know load-induced adaptive bone formation neuronally regulate . Taken together , general mechanism , bone reflex , may define bone subject load neuronally regulate bone formation muscle activity ) This study hypothesize radius subject mechanical loading may affect excitability alpha motor neuron innervate muscle , base bone mineral density .</detailed_description>
