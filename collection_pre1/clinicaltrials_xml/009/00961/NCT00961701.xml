	<detailed_description>Severe traditional PHP associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality increase acute MI prior surgery.PHP associate increased prevalence leave ventricular hypertrophy , independent blood pressure . Also prevalent PHP , valvular myocardial calcification well diastolic fill impairment , significant correlation serum calcium PTH level . Hypertension , dyslipidemia impair glucose metabolism demonstrate severe PHP , improvement surgery variables.Glucose tolerance test perform patient PHP reveal 51 % impaired glucose tolerance , 34 % diabetes mellitus 17 % impaired fasting glucose value . After successful parathyroidectomy fast 2-h plasma glucose fall significantly . Others demonstrate hyperinsulinemia impair glucose tolerance without normalization parathyroidectomy . Most literature showing increase cardiovascular risk patient severe PHP .Patients mild PHP high serum cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose , urate hemoglobin value compare controls.Also , moderate severe vitamin D deficiency risk factor develop cardiovascular disease especially patient hypertension . Atherosclerosis diffuse disease formerly consider lipid storage disease , actually involve ongoing inflammatory response . Elevated circulating level acute phase protein , cytokine , cell adhesion molecule indicate inflammatory process occur systemically . C-reactive protein [ CRP ] presence metabolic syndrome interrelate highly predictive cardiovascular disease . Hyperinsulinemia propose common factor traditional risk factor cardiovascular disease , insulin resistance recognize chronic low-level inflammatory state.Although various inflammatory marker individually significantly related future cardiovascular disease risk , add little additional prognostic information traditional marker . Recently , show great probability metabolic syndrome insulin resistance observe patient severe PHP . Serum calcium predictor cardiovascular risk factor . Recent evidence suggest 'quality ' rather 'quantity ' LDL exerts direct influence cardiovascular risk . LDL comprise multiple distinct subclass differ size , density , physicochemical composition , metabolic behaviour atherogenicity . There least four major subspecies LDL ( e.g . large LDL-I , medium LDL-II , small LDL-III , small LDL-IV ) predominance small dense LDL accept emerge cardiovascular risk factor . Thus , propose study protocol intend evaluate lipoprotein phenotype LDL size subclasses patient primary hyperparathyroidism .</detailed_description>
