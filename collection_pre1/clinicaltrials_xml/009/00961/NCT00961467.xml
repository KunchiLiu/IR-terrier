	<brief_summary>After discovery melphalan prednisone ( MP ) , many clinical trial evaluate efficacy combination chemotherapy , VMCP , VBAP , MOCCA multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient , without significant clinical benefit . After 40 year , combination MP thalidomide ( MPT ) lenalidomide ( MPR ) bortezomib ( MPV ) finally consistently show additive synergistic effects.In advance MM , combination melphalan , prednisone thalidomide induce 12 % good partial response ( VGPR ) rate , combination melphalan bortezomib show 15 % near complete remission ( nCR ) rate . In relapsed patient , combination bortezomib MPT ( VMPT ) induce 43 % VGPR rate . Preliminary result indicate VMPT may induce CR rate around 50 % newly diagnose patient ( unpublished result ) .In preclinical study thalidomide show anti-angiogenesis activity , lenalidomide show immunomodulatory effect , thus suggest combine clinical approach two drug . The toxicity profile lenalidomide completely different thalidomide cumulative toxicity expect , suggest combination approach . This study evaluate safety efficacy combine Lenalidomide , Melphalan , Prednisone Thalidomide ( R-MPT ) salvage treatment relapsed/refractory myeloma patient . This association might increase response rate achieve standard oral MPT MPR regimens .</brief_summary>
