	<brief_summary>Introduction : The aim study investigate efficacy neurofeedback ( NFB ) improve attention , memory processing speed child treat Brain Tumour ( BT ) . In Netherlands every year approximately 100 child diagnose BT . Nowadays 65 % child 5-year survival . Treatment BT consist neurosurgery / local craniospinal radiation / adjuvant chemotherapy . Neurotoxicity cause radiotherapy / chemotherapy ( especially methotrexate ) major cause neurocognitive decline Childhood Brain Tumour Survivors ( CBTS ) . Approach : Studies show NFB capacity improve brain system mediate selective attention response inhibition child Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder ( ADHD ) . The effectiveness report comparable methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) without side effect medication . CBTS exhibit symptom comparable child ADHD positive response methylphenidate find CBTS . However , NFB use intervention CBTS yet . The effectiveness NFB child treat BT investigate randomize control trial . The intervention group 30 patient receive approximately 30 session NFB ; control group receive 30 session placebo neurofeedback . Neuropsychological test use evaluate pre- post-NFB intervention well 6-month follow-up . Relevance : If NFB proof effective CBTS great improvement ( neuro- ) psychological functioning quality life , without disadvantage side effect medication . The implementation intervention might increase cognitive social functioning thus facilitate integration child society childhood school carrier well adult life .</brief_summary>
