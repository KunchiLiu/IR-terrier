	<brief_summary>Older adult disability tend spend great period time bed day often mealtime . To make safe eat bed , patient place high Fowler 's position . This mean head foot bed raise sit person . Sitting bed increase pressure buttock lead development pressure ulcer . The purpose study evaluate impact positional change call `` trunk release '' pressure buttock , breathe comfort . Primary Hypothesis - Performing trunk release old adult population low risk pressure ulcer result 5mmHg decrease peak pressure index sacral-coccygeal area measure peak pressure index use Force Sensitive Applications ( FSA ) Pressure Mapping System . Secondary Hypotheses - Performing trunk release old adult population low risk pressure ulcer result : - Improved ventilation measure 0.5 liter increase slow vital capacity . - Greater comfort measure two point change horizontal numeric scale word anchor combine Wong-Baker face scale ( Appendix D ) . - A four-centimetre displacement trunk extend towards head bed .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two research assistant conduct study . Experimenter A assist recruitment subject , set test environment performs trunk release . Experimenter B act primary data collector keep blind purpose study . The randomized allocation indicate subject intervention control group . Experimenter A set study hospital bed fit visco-elastic foam mattress , fitted sheet , flat sheet torso pressure-sensing mat . For standardization , mat align marker set bed frame . Subjects wear hospital pajama undergarment . Experimenter B record height , weight , age gender . Subject seat chair instructed spirometry maneuver . Once subject comfortable maneuver , Experimenter A ask subject lie supine body center bed hand rest abdomen . Experimenter A reminds subject remain completely immobile duration data collection . Experimenter B take baseline measure discomfort per protocol . Experimenter A place subject High Fowler 's position raise foot bed high position , 50 degree , head bed high position , 60 degree . Experimenter A set timer 8 minute per pressure mapping protocol . For stable value , `` settling time '' 8 minute require factor creep pressure map sensor mattress . Experimenter A aim laser beam top scapula subject 's shoulder meet mattress surface . Experimenter B initiate FSA file subject 's number , take pressure read 8 minute , measure trunk displacement , obtain spirometry reading per protocol , take measure discomfort . Experimenter B leave room , Experimenter A set timer 5 minute opens allocation envelope . The Principal Investigator conduct random spot check ensure consistency set-up .</detailed_description>
