	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate safety immunologic effect autologous tumor vaccination administer human granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor ( hGM-CSF ) , subsequent boosting vaccination patient make lymphopenic treatment chemotherapy infuse autologous PBMC ( Cohort A ) CD25 deplete PBMC ( Cohort B ) . Clinical observation laboratory measurement monitor evaluate safety , toxicity , immune response , anti-tumor effect . Additionally , effect treatment tumor response evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Melanoma Patients With Total CD25-depleted Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ( PBMC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , outpatient Phase II , prospective , randomize , single-center , clinical trial . Up 14 patient diagnosis unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma . All patient undergo leukapheresis collect PBMC . All patient receive Cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m2 dl-3 Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 dl-3 . Following chemotherapy induce lymphopenia , patient re-infused PDMC follow : Autologous PBMC re-infusion ( Cohort A ) Autologous , CD25-depleted PBMC re-infusion ( Cohort B ) Following PBMC re-infusion , patient receive subcutaneous GM-CSF Infusion ( 50 micrograms/24 hr ) continuously 6 day . All patient receive 4 booster vaccination follow : Intradermal injection autologous tumor cell low abdomen deliver total dose least 2x107 cell administer week 3 , week 5 , week 9 week 13 . Subcutaneous GM-CSF Infusion ( 50 micrograms/24 hr ) adjacent vaccine site begin time vaccination ( week 3 , 5 , 9 13 ) continue 6 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm malignant melanoma unresectable stage III stage IV . Measurable disease require . Patients must fail , refuse , eligible receive least one standard therapy regimen metastatic disease . Easily harvest metastatic tumor cell e.g. , skin lymph node metastasis plan surgery remove tumor . Patients undergo resection solitary brain metastasis eligible resect lesion contain adequate number tumor cell . A minimum 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm lesion require study eligibility . Sufficient viable tumor cell harvest generate vaccine . The tumor collect must contain great 1.6 x 108 viable tumor cell cell line generate autologous tumor must provide great 1.6 x 108 viable tumor cell . Patients may receive prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy . Prior radiation therapy acceptable previously radiate site may use tumor collection vaccine preparation . Life expectancy great = 3 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function time enrollment define protocol . Patients must seronegative HIV , Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody . If patient recent surgery , must recover effect surgery opinion investigator . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Radiation therapy within 2 week . Prior radiation must less 30 % bone marrow patient recover side effect , opinion investigator . Patients may receive investigational agent . Steroid therapy , replacement steroid inhale steroid . Patients might require systemic corticosteroid replacement steroid next three month eligible study . Patients know brain metastasis unless treat radiation therapy and/or surgery show stable &gt; 1 month . Autoimmune disease require treatment , exception control autoimmune thyroiditis vitiligo . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study fludarabine cyclophosphamide potential teratogenic effect . It know whether fludarabine excrete breast milk package insert caution might recommend breastfeed mother treat fludarabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation interfere interpretation results.. Any medical illness psychiatric condition/social situation opinion principal investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate treatment would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
