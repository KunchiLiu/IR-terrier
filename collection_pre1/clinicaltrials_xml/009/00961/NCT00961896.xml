	<brief_summary>Part I double-blind , randomize , vehicle-controlled Proof Concept ( PoC ) study evaluate safety , local tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics multiple topical administration LDE225 ( specific Smoothened inhibitor ) skin basal cell carcinomas Gorlin 's syndrome patient . Following 21-day screening period , patient expose multiple dos topically apply LDE225 twice daily 4 week double-blind manner . The patient return weekly visit BCC clinically evaluate digital photograph take . Local safety tolerability also assess . After last application treatment , biopsy take treated ( vehicle LDE225 ) BCCs ( three per patient ) histology , biomarker evaluation pharmacokinetics ( skin exposure ) . In addition , biopsy LDE225-treated uninvolved perilesional skin take pharmacokinetic evaluation . In total , 4 biopsy take : 2 histology biomarker 2 PK . Part II study consist 21-day screening period , baseline period ( directly commence treatment period ) treatment period 6 9 week , depend randomization . A clinical assessment perform site last treatment day full clinical response observe , approximately 3 week last treatment excision BCC ( ) would perform . The study completion visit occur either 1 week excision ( visit plan ) 1 week last treatment . For subset patient , skin biopsy collect last treatment day excision BCC also perform visit .</brief_summary>
