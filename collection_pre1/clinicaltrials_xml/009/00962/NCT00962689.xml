	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common chronic medical condition affect Americans 18-44 year age . While significant advance make understanding molecular pathogenesis underlie many subtypes CRS , translate widespread change physician manage adult pediatric CRS . The focus study intend develop test method improve objectivity specificity diagnosis allow individualized therapy less invasive , customized treatment instead traditional , empiric base , radically exenterative therapy commonly employ clinical practice . Specifically , know many patient CRS great concentration non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ) bacterial biofilms locate within sinus cavity compare healthy patient . The specific hypothesis behind propose research presence NTHI biofilms , know highly recalcitrant , positively correlate development CRS unique lipooligosaccharides inflammatory byproduct obtain nasopharyngeal lavage fluid and/or swabs sinus secretion may use non-invasive biomarker CRS . As result , patient symptoms CRS specifically associate NTHI biofilms could possibly obtain non-invasive test physician 's office would allow clinician make accurate diagnosis objectively follow patient 's responsiveness customize therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 test hypothesis high throughput proteomics-based assay nasopharyngeal lavage fluid and/or swabs human sinus drainage material able identify , high degree sensitivity specificity , patient CRS specifically due presence NTHI biofilms . Specific Aim 2 test hypothesis priori assay increase presence phosphorylcholine-rich lipooligosaccharides nasopharyngeal lavage fluid chinchillas co-infected adenovirus biofilm form NTHI successfully predict , high degree sensitivity specificity , development CRS vivo model . Results project may : enable design conduct clinical trial preoperatively identify patient CRS earlier disease course ( possibly prior initiation long course empiric antibiotic therapy ) ; aid development non-surgical therapy eradicate bacterial biofilms sinus cavity ; result identification objective biomarker monitor success therapy ; ultimately lead less morbidity risk complication compare conventional surgical therapy . In addition , transform paradigm would make progress towards achieve goal U.S. Department Health Human Services Healthy People 2010 objective 14-19 , `` reduce number course antibiotic prescribed sole diagnosis common cold .
