	<detailed_description>Healthcare change towards patient focus care . The organization care process relate quality , efficiency accessibility one main area interest within next year clinician , healthcare manager policy maker . A main method ( ) organize care process development implementation care pathway . Care pathways , also know clinical pathway critical pathway , use worldwide variety patient group . The European Pathway Association ( E-P-A ) define care pathway : `` A complex intervention mutual decision make organization predictable care well-defined group patient well defined period . Defining characteristic pathway include : explicit statement goal key element care base evidence , best practice patient expectation ; facilitation communication coordination role , sequence activity multidisciplinary care team , patient relative ; documentation , monitoring , evaluation variance outcomes ; identification relevant resource '' . Very prospective study perform publish impact pathways quality efficiency care . The European Quality Care Pathways ( EQCP ) -study involve exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) evaluate pathway effectiveness . Literature show adherence international guideline regard inhospital management COPD exacerbation low , especially non pharmacological treatment.11-19 Currently , three non-randomized trial impact care pathway inpatient management COPD exacerbation publish . The study conduct 1995 2001 , methodology doubtful . However study indicate COPD exacerbation care pathway improve performance regard diagnostic assessment use stand order , diminishes number rehospitalisation , shorten length stay ( LOS ) reduce mortality . In context high volume hospitalize COPD patient , high cost high risk , complex coordination care among multiple caregiver , care pathway could enhance quality care patient improve patient outcome , promote patient safety , increase patient satisfaction , improve multidisciplinary teamwork optimize use resource . The goal European Quality Care Pathways ( EQCP ) study : - To evaluate care pathway effectiveness acute hospital immediate link primary care ; - To evaluate effect care pathways team process team perceive organization care .</detailed_description>
