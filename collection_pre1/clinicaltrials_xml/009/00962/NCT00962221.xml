	<detailed_description>Overt hypothyroidism associate increase risk cardiovascular disease [ CVD ] indicate hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels.However , patient hypertension abnormal lipid profile , suggest factor may involve collagen-induced platelet aggregation relaxation vascular smooth muscle , elevate plasma homocysteine C- reactive protein [ CRP ] level report overt hypothyroidism propose independent risk factor CVD . Subclinical hypothyroidism [ SH ] highly prevalent elderly subject , especially woman older 50 year age . Whether SH relate risk premature CVD controversial . Previously , demonstrate SH middle-aged woman associate hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , elevate total cholesterol/HDL- cholesterol ratio.SH associate elevate plasma total cholesterol LDL-cholesterol , decrease LDL-cholesterol/LDL-triglycerides due decrease hepatic lipase activity . The influence SH lipids directly proportional degree TSH elevation . Atherosclerosis diffuse disease formerly consider lipid storage disease , actually involve ongoing inflammatory response . Elevated circulating level acute phase protein , cytokine , cell adhesion molecule indicate inflammatory process occur systematically . Metabolic syndrome collection metabolic risk factor , probably one cause , appear promote development atherosclerotic CVD . Hypertension , dyslipidemia hyperglycemia widely recognize characteristic metabolic syndrome . Individuals metabolic syndrome manifest prothrombotic state well proinflammatory state . Insulin resistance recognize chronic low-level inflammatory state . Insulin action important effector mechanism proinflammatory cytokine CVD . Insulin resistance propose common precede factor hypertension , LDL HDL-cholesterol , hypertriglyceridemia , abdominal obesity alter glucose metabolism , link development CVD . Thus , inflammation , metabolic syndrome insulin resistance strongly associate play important role pathogenesis atherosclerosis . In cross-sectional analysis , subject SH significantly high prevalence CVD euthyroid subject . There cardiovascular death subject SH euthyroid population . These data suggest SH may independent risk factor CVD . It clear yet whether patient SH cardiovascular risk , patient overt hypothyroidism , whether metabolic syndrome insulin resistance already exist untreated patient SH . This question recently study group . We evaluate untreated patient SH . percentage MS patient ( 41.5 % ) significantly high control ( 12.2 % ; p=0.003 ] . SH significantly high likelihood cardiovascular risk [ odds ratio 6.26 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.6 - 4.49 , p= 0.008 MS ] . We conclude SH associate great probability MS . Recent evidence suggest 'quality ' rather 'quantity ' LDL exerts direct influence cardiovascular risk . LDL comprise multiple distinct subclass differ size , density , physicochemical composition , metabolic behaviour atherogenicity . There least four major subspecies LDL ( e.g . large LDL-I , medium LDL-II , small LDL-III , small LDL-IV ) predominance small dense LDL accept emerge cardiovascular risk factor . Thus , propose study protocol intend evaluate lipoprotein phenotype LDL size subclass patient subclinical Hypothyroidism .</detailed_description>
