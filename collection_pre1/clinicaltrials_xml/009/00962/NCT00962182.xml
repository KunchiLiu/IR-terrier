	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether cocktail two common food-grade enzyme supplement lead decrease serum activity marker celiac disease patient insufficiently treat previous gluten exclusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Enzyme Supplements Treat Celiac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Celiac disease genetically determine abnormal immune response gluten , component wheat , rye barley protein cause damage villous structure small bowel . The active disease characterize induction gluten-dependent autoantibody transglutaminase type-2 , sensitive specific non-invasive marker gluten-sensitivity . Gluten-free diet normally lead clearance antibody serum 6-12 month . Persistent seropositivity problem patient incompletely exclude gluten frequently transgress diet . In case , damage small bowel may persist complication may occur high frequency . The central hypothesis test enzyme treatment design degrade certain amount gluten absorption gastrointestinal tract lead clinically meaningful decrease auto-antibody level patient .</detailed_description>
