	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib ditosylate together capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lapatinib ditosylate together capecitabine work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Capecitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy lapatinib ditosylate capecitabine first-line therapy , term overall survival , patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . Secondary - To evaluate progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To evaluate overall response rate ( complete partial response ) patient treat regimen . - To evaluate clinical benefit ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ≥ 6 month ) regimen patient . - To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity associate regimen patient . - To determine intra-tumoral expression ErbB1 ( EGFR ) ErbB2 ( HER2/neu ) patient . - To seek pilot information intra-tumoral expression marker tumor resistance sensitivity treatment , include resistance drug pump expression growth factor receptor expression . - To collect pre- post-treatment serum sample patient proteomic analysis elucidate serum cancer marker profile detect . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-21 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6-12 week .</detailed_description>
