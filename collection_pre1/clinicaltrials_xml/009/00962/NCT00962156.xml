	<brief_summary>- By tradition hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) use obtain fast circulatory stabilisation critically ill. - High molecular weight HES may , however , cause acute kidney failure patient severe sepsis . - Now low molecular weight HES 130/0.4 prefer colloid Scandinavian intensive care unit ( ICU ) 1st choice fluid patient severe sepsis . - HES 130/0.4 largely unstudied ICU patient . - This investigator-initiated Scandinavian multicentre trial conduct assess effect HES 130/0.4 mortality endstage kidney failure patient severe sepsis . - The trial provide important data clinician resuscitate septic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scandinavian Starch Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid mainstay treatment sepsis resuscitation , effect different crystalloid colloid solution outcome remain unknown . Previously , high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch , HES 200 , use , find cause acute kidney failure patient severe sepsis . As kidney failure independent risk factor death patient , HES 200 use anymore . In stead low molecular weight starch , HES 130 , develop . Presently , preferred colloid Scandinavian intensive care unit ( ICU ) , effect HES 130 ICU patient currently unknown . The proposed Scandinavian multicentre study conduct assess HES 130 contributes acute kidney failure patient severe sepsis . As HES 130 widely use , trial provide important safety data clinician resuscitate septic patient .</detailed_description>
