	<brief_title>Breathing Device Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic orthostatic intolerance , sometimes know postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) , common disorder among patient see several center specialize disease autonomic nervous system . It affect estimate 500,000 people United States alone . POTS ( excessive increase heart rate [ &gt; 30 min-1 ] stand associate orthostatic symptom [ include palpitation , chest pain syndrome , dyspnea standing , mental cloud difficulty concentration ] , absence orthostatic hypotension ) produce substantial disability among otherwise healthy people . Patients POTS typically feel tired run . Many also report myriad symptom hard categorize , often involve fatigue . One study , Mayo Clinic , find patient POTS diminish quality life measure use standard health status instrument ( SF-36 ) . In pilot study , test hypothesis breathe inspiratory resistance device improve orthostatic tolerance reduce orthostatic tachycardia patient postural tachycardia syndrome .</detailed_description>
