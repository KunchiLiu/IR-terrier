	<brief_title>Exclusion Left Atrial Appendage ( LAA ) With LAAx , Inc. TigerPaw System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary safety outcome rate device relate adverse serious adverse event assess peri-operatively , 30 90 day post procedure . The primary effectiveness outcome percentage patient complete exclusion leave atrial appendage assess peri-operatively ( visually ) , 90 day post procedure via transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) . Transesophageal echocardiography perform intra-operatively 90 day post procedure . Intra-operative follow-up TEE examination read centrally core laboratory . Any Doppler flow across Fastener exclude portion appendage also consider failure exclusion . The presence absence LAA and/or LA thrombus evaluate . Patients also evaluate potential source embolism , include aortic atheroma , patent foramen ovale , intracardiac shunt . Data collection complete baseline , time open cardiac surgery procedure throughout perioperative hospitalization . Patients evaluate 30 day post surgery 90 day post surgery .</detailed_description>
