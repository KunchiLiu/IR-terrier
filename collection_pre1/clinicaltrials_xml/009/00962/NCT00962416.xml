	<detailed_description>Background Stent Study : A routine invasive strategy use percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) show improve survival freedom recurrent myocardial infarction compare thrombolysis patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . In addition standard medical treatment , PCI use coronary artery stent eliminate underlying stenotic lesion , afford mechanical mean plaque stabilization , normalize coronary blood flow , reduce shear stress , local intracoronary thrombosis . Notwithstanding , implantation coronary artery stent associate arterial injury initiate vasculo-proliferative cascade result provoke structural change vessel wall . The implantation bare-metal stent ( BMS ) primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( P-PCI ) STEMI patient result restenosis 20 % patient show reduce rate mortality reinfarction . Randomised trial meta-analyses show use drug-eluting stent ( DES ) compare BMS patient STEMI significantly reduce rate target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) without negative impact rate death myocardial infarction one year . However , remain important caveat surround safety DES patient STEMI evidence harm may arise long term follow . DES implantation culprit lesion patient acute coronary syndrome identify independent predictor late stent thrombosis . DES oppose BMS implant pro-thrombotic , inflammatory milieu rupture plaque STEMI patient may lead aneurysmal change adjacent vessel wall . First generation DES implant STEMI lesion find associate substantial delay healing compare BMS . Moreover , DES implant STEMI lesion associate high frequency incompletely appose strut uncovered strut assess OCT compare DES implant stable lesion . These data suggest significantly increase risk late thrombotic complication relate DES . The phenomenon aneurysmal change vessel wall may lead incomplete stent apposition , turn may predispose late complication stent thrombosis , recurrent myocardial infarction , death . In conclusion , although coronary artery stent constitute routine medical intervention improve acute long-term result STEMI patient , limited information exist long-term clinical outcome structural change adjacent vessel wall . First generation DES control release sirolimus paclitaxel durable polymer reduce angiographic clinical measure restenosis patient STEMI . Limus analogue effective site-specific agent paclitaxel reduce neointimal growth repeat revascularisation procedure . However , late stent thrombosis germane first-generation drug-eluting stent bare-metal stent owe delayed heal re-endothelialization . Furthermore , hypersensitivity reaction polymer may increase risk stent thrombosis . These effect may particularly pronounce ruptured plaque STEMI patient due direct contact necrotic core . The biolimus-eluting stent study present proposal several feature , attenuate mention adverse effect . First , polymer-drug combination apply solely abluminal stent strut surface ( rather circumferential ) , thus maximize exposure vessel wall minimize release circulation . Second , drug ( biolimus A9 ) release biodegradable polymer , completely degrades carbondioxide water 6-9 month period , render stent closely BMS . Recently , safety efficacy biolimus-eluting stent use biodegradable polymer demonstrate large trial 1,707 patient undergoing PCI . While overall result show non-inferiority safety efficacy endpoint compare sirolimus-eluting stent , biolimus-eluting stent show improved outcome term MACE , stent thrombosis TLR pre-specified subgroup STEMI patient . While clinical data describe show favorable safety efficacy profile , promise result ot subgroup analysis require confirmation dedicate randomized trial subset patient STEMI . The present study therefore design compare safety efficacy biolimus-eluting Biomatrix stent bare-metal stent otherwise identical design prospective , multi-center , randomize , control trial patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction . To address issue late acquire stent apposition stent strut coverage , image substudy use grayscale IVUS OCT perform . Imaging Substudy : A ) Stent Imaging Substudy The implantation drug elute stent pro-thrombotic , inflammatory milieu rupture plaque STEMI patient may lead aneurysmal change adjacent vessel wall possibly lead incomplete stent apposition , turn may constitute risk factor late complication adverse outcome . Delayed incomplete stent strut coverage endothelialization another vessel wall reaction possibly related adverse late outcome increase risk late stent thrombosis . OCT provide valuable modality assessment stent strut coverage 10x high resolution IVUS . Recently , biolimus-eluting stent show result complete stent strut coverage 9 month compare sirolimus-eluting stent OCT substudy LEADERS trial . To compare biological behaviour new generation DES biodegradable polymer compare bare-metal stent , image substudy use IVUS OCT detailed analysis post-procedural follow-up vessel wall behaviour perform . B ) Plaque Imaging Substudy Although short-term outcome patient ACS STEMI improve recent year , clinical outcome one year remain complicated recurrent myocardial infarction death 10-15 % patient . Previous study use angioscopy suggest delay plaque healing , persistent thrombus , recurrent plaque rupture principal mechanisms lesion progression clinical complication . However , study limit small sample size , omission follow-up imaging , lack correlation easily accessible serum marker , unavailability high resolution image technology OCT . Moreover , estimate patient ACS one rupture plaque &gt; 40-80 % case , frequently leave untreated therefore may contribute long-term adverse clinical outcome . Frequency , distribution , composition ( TCFA versus non TCFA ) , time-related change plaque entire coronary tree patient STEMI document far , mainly due technical limitation OCT image method . New-generation OCT system available present study allow systematic assessment long coronary segment . The combination IVUS-VH OCT substantially improve accuracy detection plaque especially TCFA . Therefore , new insight regard frequency , distribution , composition evolution coronary artery plaque prognostic impact patient clinical outcome expect present study . Since patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction suffer recurrent ischemic event rate 5-10 % first year , finding may important therapeutic implication medical treatment affect patient reduce risk recurrence improve prognosis . Objective To establish superiority biolimus-eluting ( Biomatrix ) stent compare otherwise identical bare-metal stent ( Gazelle ) term composite endpoint death , target-vessel related myocardial infarction 1 year . Imaging Substudy To compare neointimal thickness strut coverage stent type lesion STEMI patient 13 month assessment frequency , distribution time relate change culprit versus non culprit lesion patient acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction . Methods Stent study This prospective , multi-center , randomize , assessor-blind , trial conduct several swiss european interventional cardiology site . A total 1100 patient randomize 1:1 basis either biolimus-eluting stent biodegradable polymer bare-metal stent . The number stent limited per patient , must consistently implant accord assigned treatment allocation . All patient follow clinically 5 year stent implantation . Imaging substudy 100 1100 randomized patient fulfil specific inclusion criterion ( see ) undergo IVUS-VH OCT culprit lesion prior stent implantation well follow . Moreover , IVUS-VH/OCT perform three major epicardial vessel baseline follow . The imaging study perform University Hospital Bern , Geneva , Lausanne Cardiocentro Lugano , Switzerland .</detailed_description>
