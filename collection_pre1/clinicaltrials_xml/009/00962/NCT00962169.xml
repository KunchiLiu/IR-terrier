	<brief_title>Guideline Implementation Physiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary The main objective plan , systematic , theory-based development pilot test intervention strategy increase physiotherapist ' adherence evidence-based practice guideline low back pain . Although demonstrated recommendation guideline effective , implementation physiotherapy practice remain limited . This incomplete implementation result considerable inefficiency physiotherapy practice ( e.g . regular use less effective treatment strategy ) consequently contribute extensive socio-economic problem associate low back pain ( 1.7 % BNP ) . Until , however , implementation strategy increase guideline adherence effective . The lack coherent theoretical framework point possibly important explanatory factor . Recent report therefore emphasize expansion theoretical basis regard implementation problem . The present project ( January 2007 ) build promising result cross-sectional study among Dutch physiotherapist , apply Precede-Proceed planning model ass determinant guideline adherence . To end , theoretical framework construct combined Diffusion Innovations Theory , Precaution Adoption Process Model , elements Organization Development . The questionnaire base framework turn useful tool systematically study barrier facilitator associate guideline adherence . However , similar , longitudinal study need assess determinant actually predict guideline adherence . For longitudinal study , framework need slightly revise ( 5 month ) . The adapted theoretical framework turn , guide subsequent revision determinant questionnaire ( 3 month ) . The longitudinal determinant study ( 10 month ) among primary care physiotherapist ( N = 1,600 ) perform via mail . Determinants guideline adherence assess revise questionnaire . Actual guideline adherence determine recently develop longitudinal paper &amp; pencil vignettes cover eleven important indicator adherence . Statistical analysis combine data disclose individual , social / organizational determinant fact predict guideline adherence . The result longitudinal study use systematically develop implementation enhance strategy ( 8 month ) , specifically aim modify determinant predict adherence . The development base Intervention Mapping approach . This approach , instance , assist choose objective strategy change , combine coherent program plan . To assess efficacy combination implementation strategy , pilot test ( 4 month ) perform among primary care physiotherapist ( N = 30 ) within network physiotherapy practice ( N = 10 ) . The short-term effect determinant predict guideline adherence actual guideline implementation assess similar way precede longitudinal study . Additional process information collect refine implementation enhance strategy explore opportunity implementation strategy primary care . A secondary objective present study examine value plan , systematic , theory-based approach implementation practice guideline general . Depending finding present study , expect able formulate implication use coherent theoretical framework current practice guideline implementation development strategy increase guideline adherence among wide variety health care profession , well use plan model systematic intervention development model future implementation effort guideline adherence study . This study first field guideline implementation applies ( 1 ) comprehensive theoretical framework guideline adherence , ( 2 ) Precede-Proceed planning model assessment determinant predict guideline adherence , ( 3 ) systematic approach Intervention Mapping development implementation strategy . The result report peer-reviewed article include dissertation ( December 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
