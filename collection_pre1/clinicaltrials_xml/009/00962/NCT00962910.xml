	<brief_title>European Quality Care Pathways Study Proximal Femur Fracture ( EQCP-PFF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthcare change towards patient focus care . The organization care process relate quality , efficiency accessibility one main area interest within next year clinician , healthcare manager policy maker . A main method ( ) organize care process development implementation care pathway . Care pathways , also know clinical pathway critical pathway , use worldwide variety patient group . The European Pathway Association ( E-P-A ) define care pathway : `` A complex intervention mutual decision make organization predictable care well-defined group patient well defined period . Defining characteristic pathway include : explicit statement goal key element care base evidence , best practice patient expectation ; facilitation communication coordination role , sequence activity multidisciplinary care team , patient relative ; documentation , monitoring , evaluation variance outcomes ; identification relevant resource '' . Some prospective study perform publish impact pathways quality efficiency care . The European Quality Care Pathways ( EQCP ) -study involve proximal femur fracture ( PFF ) evaluate pathway effectiveness . Literature show adherence international guideline regard inhospital management PFF low pre-operative post-operative care . Currently , non-randomized trial ( control clinical trial , cohort case-control study ) protocols impact care pathway inpatient management proximal femur fracture publish . The study conduct 1992 2004 , methodology often doubtful . However , study indicate care pathway PFF improve performance regard pre-operative post-operative intervention ( i.e . time surgery time mobilisation surgery ) , diminish length stay ( acute total ) , in-hospital mortality , 30-day mortality , 1-year mortality , readmission rate post-operative complication like pressure sores ulcer . In context high volume PFF patient , high cost high risk , complex coordination care among multiple caregiver , care pathway could enhance quality care patient improve patient outcome , promote patient safety , increase patient satisfaction , improve multidisciplinary teamwork optimize use resource . The goal European Quality Care Pathways ( EQCP ) study : - To evaluate care pathway effectiveness acute hospital immediate link primary care ; - To evaluate effect care pathways team process team perceive organization care .</detailed_description>
