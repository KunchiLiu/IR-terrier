	<brief_title>Relationship Between Dopamine Genetics , Food Reinforcement , Energy Intake Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One important research area obesity develop good understand individual difference factor influence excess energy intake positive energy balance . One key understand individual difference determine factor underlie motivation eat . We demonstrate series study obese adult child motivate work palatable , favorite food leaner peer high food reinforcement consume food ad libitum eat task find food reinforce . Dopamine ( DA ) one major neurotransmitter involve establish reinforce value food , low level dopamine activity reduction number DA receptor associate obesity . The general aim propose research build upon research examine relationship food reinforcement , obesity , polymorphisms gene within dopaminergic system .</detailed_description>
