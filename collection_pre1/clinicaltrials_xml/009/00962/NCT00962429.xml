	<brief_title>Lipoic Acid Treat Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy ( CIDP ) progressive disease leading paralysis . CIDP immune-mediated disorder result synergistic interaction T cell-mediated B cell-mediated immune response direct peripheral nerve antigen . These immune mediate response turn increase production reactive oxygen intermediate cause oxidative damage peripheral nerve system . Although corticosteroid , plasma exchange , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) reduce impairment cause CIDP least temporarily use first-line treatment , ideal long-term treatment serious side effect cost . Alpha lipoic acid ( LA ) antioxidant also possess anti-immune activity . It effective treat diabetic neuropathy . It also promise treat patient multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>
