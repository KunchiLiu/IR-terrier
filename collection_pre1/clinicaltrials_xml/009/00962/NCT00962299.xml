Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) show effective preschool child multiple trigger wheeze , effect small old child . This justify critical approach towards therapy , example prescribe trial ICS period 3 month evaluate effect afterwards . Little research perform effect ICS preschool child episodic viral wheeze . A high dose ICS ( &gt; 1600 ug/d ) acute episode dyspnea wheeze show effective , number small clinical trial maintenance treatment ICS effect number severity episodes viral wheezing . Contradictory result publish effect ICS infant preschool child Respiratory Syncytial Virus bronchiolitis . Some study show reduction wheeze episode RSV bronchiolitis child treat ICS , two study show positive effect . Prescribing ICS preschool child result adverse effect reduce height growth . Because lack evidence effect ICS episodic viral wheeze , guideline advise critical approach towards prescribe ICS episodic viral wheeze .</detailed_description>
