	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood , tumor tissue , skin laboratory patient melanoma receive hydroxychloroquine may help doctor understand effect hydroxychloroquine biomarkers . PURPOSE : This early phase I trial study hydroxychloroquine patient stage III stage IV melanoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To characterize effect hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) modulation marker autophagy , measure p62 , Beclin1 , LC3 , GRp170 expression , pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy sample , skin sample , peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample patient stage III IV melanoma undergo palliative curative surgery . Secondary - To determine whether steady-state plasma concentration HCQ correlate observed trend induced marker autophagy . - To determine potential mechanism antitumor effect HCQ , measure reduction tumor cell proliferation ( Ki-67 mitotic rate ) increase apoptosis ( activate caspase-3 TUNEL assay ) melanoma specimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery . Blood , tumor tissue , skin sample collect pharmacokinetic correlative laboratory study . Expression p62 , Beclin1 , LC3 , GRp170 ( autophagy marker ) analyze .</detailed_description>
