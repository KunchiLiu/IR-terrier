	<brief_summary>The goal clinical study learn Pegasys ( pegylated interferon ) Roferon ( interferon ) make Trivalent Inactivated Influenza vaccine ( TIV ) effective increase body 's immune reaction flu virus patient Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reactogenicity , Immunogenicity Trivalent Influenza Vaccine With Recombinant Interferon Alpha Among Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Pegylated interferon interferon design stop growth virus . Pegylated interferon molecule make last long body . Standard interferon molecule make last long . TIV design prevent flu . Screening Test : Before start treatment study , `` screen test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If routine blood test last 4 week , blood need drawn . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) blood test within 2 week study entry . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 group . If assign Group 1 , receive TIV alone . If assign Group 2 , receive pegylated interferon TIV . If assign Group 3 , receive interferon TIV . You equal chance assign 3 group . Your doctor , study doctor , study staff , know group . Study Drug Administration : You receive TIV needle muscle arm ( arm write ) Days 1 28 . - If Group 1 , receive TIV - If Group 2 , receive pegylated interferon right receive TIV . It give needle skin . It give near TIV injection site . - If Group 3 , receive interferon right receive TIV . It give needle skin . It give near TIV injection site . After give injection ( ) , watch 15 minute clinic allow go home . You keep diary 1 week ( 7 day ) injection ( ) . In , record symptom may experience , also record body temperature . Study Visits : On Day 1 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw check immune system 's response flu virus . On Day 8 , ask return clinic symptom/temperature diary review . If come clinic , member research staff call review information . This phone call take 15-30 minute . On Day 28 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw check immune system response flu virus . On Day 56 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw check immune system response flu virus . If live town return M. D. Anderson visit , may blood draw local clinic . You mail blood study doctor pre-paid envelope . On Month 6 , call ask side effect may experience . This phone call take 15-30 minute . Length Study : You consider study Month 6 phone call . You take off-study early intolerable side effect allergic reaction occur . This investigational study . TIV , pegylated interferon , interferon FDA approve commercially available . At time , use pegylated interferon standard interferon TIV use research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
