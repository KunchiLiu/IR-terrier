	<brief_summary>This randomize study compare three different freeze method store human vitro fertilization ( IVF ) embryo : vitrification two commercial kit slow freezing . After information , patient undergo IVF treatment include study . If qualify , embryo different developmental stage allocate three method . At end first year survival developmental rate , implantation pregnancy rate analyze order determine best method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advance achieve vitro fertilized treatment , know chance implantation fertilise vitro embryo remain limited , around 20 % . Cryopreservation supernumerary embryo produce IVF cycle provide opportunity patient increase number transfer per oocyte harvest cycle , increase chance conception . The freezing technique may involve different medium method , lead different survival developmental rate thaw . Vitrification new freeze method , consist expose cell high concentration cryoprotectants cool ultra-rapidly ; induces increase viscosity favour formation vitreous state without ice crystal formation . This method contrast slow freeze method ( currently employ ) , base exposure low concentration cryoprotectants combine long cool time associate high risk ice crystal formation . Both method reduce cell survival embryo ability develop , either high concentration cryoprotectants case vitrification , ice crystal formation case slow freezing . The advantage vitrification embryology may considerable embryo seem sensitive ice crystal formation cyroportectant concentration ; consequently , elimination office crystal injury may increase survival chance . Additionally case vitrification , time require equilibration cool considerably reduce well need expensive equipment programmable machine eliminate . At present , vitrification slow freezing use cryopreservation oocytes embryos stage development . Encouraging result obtain vitrification , study randomly compare one study , two protocol cryoprotectors . The purpose clinic randomise study compare three treatment : traditional slow freezing method currently employ ( control group ) two different commercial vitrification method ( experimental group ) assess efficacy technique may involve .</detailed_description>
