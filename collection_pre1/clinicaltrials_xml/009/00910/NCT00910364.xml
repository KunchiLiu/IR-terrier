	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Exercise Patients With Leg Blood Clots</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) affect nearly 300,000 people U.S. year . DVT leg result PTS 65 % patient , despite receive appropriate medical management anticoagulant therapy . PTS , cause persistent venous outflow obstruction venous valvular dysfunction , may result symptom leg pain , swell , heaviness cramp especially prolong standing . All eligible patient document first-episode DVT interested participate undergo medical screen screening treadmill test prior enrollment two four week post DVT diagnosis . All patient provide asked wear class II ( 30 40mmHg ) knee length compression hose daily entire trial . The formal exercise training include supervised walk program home-based walk program 12 week follow-up 26 week . Blood test take measure level indicator inflammation baseline , week 4 , week 12 , week 26 . The primary outcome feasibility exercise program incidence post-thrombotic syndrome 26 week .</detailed_description>
