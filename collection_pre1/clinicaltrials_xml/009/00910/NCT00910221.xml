	<brief_summary>Acute kidney dysfunction common cardiac surgery . While many patient suffer long-term ill effect post-operative kidney dysfunction , require initiation dialysis therapy contribute long-term morbidity . Further , evidence suggest patient require dialysis cardiac surgery high risk death hospital . The exact reason patient develop acute kidney dysfunction cardiac surgery well understood . However , research evidence date suggest presence co-morbid illness ( i.e. , diabetes mellitus ) exposure cardiopulmonary bypass ( heart-lung machine use operation heart stop ) . Cardiopulmonary bypass , particular , show over-activate several aspect body 's immune system . Such over-activity induce oxidative stress contribute acute kidney dysfunction . The investigator believe statin drug , atorvastatin , might reduce oxidative stress occur cardiopulmonary bypass , thus , prevent reduce magnitude acute kidney dysfunction patient high risk . The investigator hope give atorvastatin ( 40 mg orally ) patient immediately prior 3 day cardiac surgery , compare effect kidney function patient atorvastatin . Atorvastatin commonly prescribe medication Australia use reduce blood cholesterol level decrease risk heart attack stroke . Recently , however , discover atorvastatin may useful prevention inflammation oxidative stress condition , follow cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . Thus , investigator plan examine whether atorvastatin prevent acute kidney dysfunction . This trial plan pilot study . If atorvastatin show promise evidence reduction acute kidney dysfunction , study large scale would require justify general use . The investigator plan determine whether atorvastatin , statin drug , possess kidney protective effect patient risk perioperative acute kidney dysfunction cardiac surgery exposure cardiopulmonary bypass . This pilot , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial . The investigator plan administer atorvastatin ( 40 mg orally ) placebo patient immediately prior 3 day cardiac surgery . The atorvastatin/placebo give orally either orogastric tube induction anaesthesia swallow patient . Whether particular patient receive atorvastatin placebo decide random , neither patient investigator aware allocate treatment . The investigator plan measure kidney function cardiac surgery use standard blood test . The investigator also plan measure marker inflammation oxidative stress blood . This may give insight mechanism whereby atorvastatin exerts effect . The investigator also take four 20 ml sample blood , space , operation , arterial catheter routinely insert every patient undergo cardiac surgery . The investigator believe significant additional risk patient participates study , discomfort normally associate cardiac surgery . Informed consent obtain patient prior operation one investigator ICU research nurse . The clinical care patient consent reason affect .</brief_summary>
