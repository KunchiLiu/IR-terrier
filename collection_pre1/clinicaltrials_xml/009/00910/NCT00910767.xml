	<brief_title>Closing Loop Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) need regular insulin injection continuous delivery insulin use insulin pump order keep blood glucose level normal . We know keep blood sugar normal range help prevent long term diabetes related complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult tight try control blood glucose level , great risk person develop episode low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . This particular problem night one solution develop system whereby amount insulin inject closely match blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve call `` close loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive insulin pump . This system develop Cambridge trialed 16 child adolescent T1D clinical setting past year . We find system effective prevent hypoglycaemia group patient . We recruit 12 adult T1D insulin pump therapy , study do clinical research facility . The subject study two night . On one night normal insulin pump therapy night insulin pump vary accord information blood glucose value continuous glucose sensor . This information manually type computer every 15 minute 8pm 8am . The algorithm advise insulin infusion rate manually change trained nurse every 15 minute throughout night .</detailed_description>
