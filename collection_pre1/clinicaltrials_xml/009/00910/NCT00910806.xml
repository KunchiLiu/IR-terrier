	<detailed_description>TMC207 investigate treatment M. tuberculosis ( TB ) infection . This Phase I , open-label ( participant investigator know name assign medication ) , single-sequence ( participant receive treatment order ) drug-drug interaction trial human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infect patient investigate potential interaction steady-state nevirapine ( NVP ) 200 mg b.i.d . ( twice day ) single dose 400 mg TMC207 . The study medication take orally . The trial population consist 16 patient infected HIV-1 virus yet treat infection ( antiretroviral ARV naïve ) medical indication start ARV therapy elect start treatment NVP plus two nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( N ( ) RTIs ) . The primary objective evaluate effect steady-state NVP 200 mg b.i.d . pharmacokinetics TMC207 M2 metabolite single-dose administration TMC207 400 mg , HIV-1 infect patient . The secondary objective evaluate effect single-dose TMC207 400 mg steady-state plasma concentration NVP 200 mg b.i.d . evaluate short-term safety tolerability coadministration single-dose TMC207 steady-state NVP HIV-1 infect patient . Prior start NVP-containing regimen , patient receive single dose TMC207 400 mg ( Treatment A ) . At least 2 4 week later , NVP start ( combination 2 N ( ) RTIs ) recommend dose regimen ( 200 mg daily 2 week follow 200 mg twice daily ) . After 4 week NVP dose 200 mg b.i.d. , second single dose TMC207 400 mg administer ( Treatment B ) .Pharmacokinetic profile 336 hour determine TMC207 N-monodesmethyl metabolite ( M2 ) administration TMC207 400 mg alone , combination steady-state NVP . Morning predose concentration NVP determine several time points.Safety tolerability evaluate throughout trial . Adverse event record every visit . A blood urine sample take screening , day -1 , 1 , 2 15 treatment A B follow-up visit . An electrocardiogram record screening , twice day 1 day 2 15 treatment A B last follow-up visit . Vital sign measure screening , day 1 , 2 15 treatment A B follow-up visit . A physical examination perform screening , day -1 treatment A B follow-up visit . On day 1 treatment A B 400 mg TMC207 ( 4 tablet ) take mouth morning within 10 minute completion breakfast . At least 2 4 week first single dose TMC207 , NVP start [ combination 2 N ( ) RTIs ] 200 mg daily 2 week follow 200 mg twice daily , orally . After 4 week NVP dose 200 mg twice daily , second single dose TMC207 administer .</detailed_description>
