	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy follow radiotherapy standard treatment patient unresectable HNSCC . However , role induction chemotherapy remain uncertain resectable disease . Therefore , plan perform phase II study evaluate , focus radiographic pathologic response induction chemotherapy . Moreover , new EGFR monoclonal antibody ( nimotuzumab ) incorporate PF regimen . The hypothesis addition nimotuzumab would improve response without remarkably increase toxicity .</detailed_description>
