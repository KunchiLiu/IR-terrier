	<brief_title>To Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy TMC207 Part Individualized Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) Treatment Regimen Participants With Sputum Smear-positive Pulmonary MDR-TB .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) trial evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy TMC207 part individualize Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) treatment regimen participant sputum smear-positive pulmonary MDR-TB . Approximately 225 participant receive TMC207 24 week combination individualize background regimen ( BR ) antibacterial drug use treatment TB accord national international guideline select baseline visit . TMC207 dosage 400 mg daily ( q.d . ) first 2 week 200 mg 3 times/week ( t.i.w . ) follow 22 week . Upon completion 24-week treatment TMC207 , participant continue receive BR care physician accordance national TB program ( NTP ) treatment guideline . Additionally , pharmacokinetics ( body absorbs , distributes , metabolize eliminates drug ) TMC207 N-monodesmethyl metabolite ( M2 ) , pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( study action effect drug body ) relationships safety efficacy assess . Safety evaluation perform lab test , vital sign , ECG , report adverse event , physical examination X-rays . All participant follow 19 month last intake TMC207 . Also participants prematurely withdraw ( unless withdraw consent ) follow period last follow-up visit last patient trial . Investigators ask provide information survival/clinical outcome participant throughout follow-up period , approximately every 6 month . Primary outcome time sputum culture conversion Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube ( MGIT ) beyond treatment TMC207 . Sputum culture conversion define 2 consecutive negative culture sputa collect least 28 day apart .</detailed_description>
