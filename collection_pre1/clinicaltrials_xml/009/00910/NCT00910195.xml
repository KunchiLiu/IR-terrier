	<brief_summary>Between 2 % -4 % adult population suffers obstructive sleep apnea ( OSAS ) ( 1 ) , characterize obstructive snoring , repetitive apnea hypopnea sleep , repetitive cyclic oxygen saturation , result sleep fragmentation relate arousal sleep profile clinical consequence like day drowsiness , neuropsychological deficit , raise danger accident cardiovascular disease . ( 1-6 ) . The therapy choice application nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ( 7-9 ) . Increasing relevance obtain combined sleep-related breathing disturbance , patient show obstructive sleep apnea syndrome central breathing disturbance polysomnography night . Those patient frequently present cardiovascular disease . These combined night breathe disturbance frequently insufficient mitigate exclusively CPAP therapy . Some modification nCPAP therapy develop order optimize therapy-compliance effectiveness therapy . Bi-level-CPAP-devices produce two pressure level : one inspiration another expiration , patient able expire constant low pressure . An increase use application comparison conventional automatic CPAP therapy could prove early study . ( 12 , 13 ) The principle automatic nCPAP therapy recognize patient 's current need pressure alter pressure within set range apply different algorithm . Some study show therapy increase compliance comfort ( 14-16 ) , study could confirm result . ( 17 , 18 ) The result current study prove treatment new algorithm therapy base automatic bi-level-system patient sleep-related respiratory disorder effectively subjective comfortable conventional CPAP therapy . Patients particularly high need pressure experience clear expiratory pressure relief high comfort . Therefore good compliance expect . In way patient additional central respiratory disturbance obtain benefit bi-level modus . This new treatment would help particularly `` critical patient '' , respond well CPAP therapy find uncomfortable .</brief_summary>
