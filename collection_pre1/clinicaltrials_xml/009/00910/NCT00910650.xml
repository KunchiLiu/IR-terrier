	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 2 study find best way give new experimental regimen determine treat metastatic melanoma human . In phase 2 study , experimental product give initially group 8 people . If safe find significant anti-tumor activity , give 14 people , total 22 people study . Physicians watch subject carefully harmful side effect . Although experimental regimen well test laboratory animal study , similar regimen give group patient National Cancer Institute Bethesda , MD , side effect people completely know ahead time . This protocol offer people whose condition help know treatment . The study procedure start collection white blood cell apheresis ( procedure blood drawn patient separate component , retain , white blood cell , remainder return transfusion patient ) . Subjects ask undergo two aphereses , one make gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs dendritic cell vaccine , second one subject receive gene modify cell later study blood . On day first apheresis , subject admit hospital receive chemotherapy next five day decrease risk rejection transfer cell subject 's immune system facilitate expansion attack melanoma lesion . During time , gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs dendritic cell manufacture laboratory apheresis product extensively tested assure express appropriate TCR contain contaminate bacteria virus . Then gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs give back subject vein arm . It follow vaccination dendritic cell skin . During next fourteen day , subject also receive interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , standard treatment patient metastatic melanoma . During next 2 3 week , subject stay hospital study investigator determine subject fully recovered procedure , safe subject go home . Chemotherapy frequently cause decrease platelet red blood cell , therefore subject may require platelet and/or red blood cell transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-stage phase II clinical trial combine primary endpoint determine safety , feasibility anti-tumor activity adoptive transfer peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) genetically engineer express alpha beta chain high affinity T cell receptor ( TCR ) specific HLA-A*0201-restricted MART-1 melanoma tumor antigen patient locally advance metastatic melanoma . This gene transfer facilitate retroviral vector pseudotyped gibbon ape leukemia virus ( GaLV ) envelope . The two transgene link picornavirus 2A sequence . Their expression driven retroviral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) . Patients MART-1-positive locally advanced metastatic melanoma HLA-A*0201-positive , HIV , hepatitis B C seronegative , receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy condition regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine , receive adoptive transfer autologous PBMC transduce MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector , express high affinity TCR MART-1 melanoma antigen ( MART-1 F5 TCR ) . The cell dose 10^9 autologous PBMC transduce MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector . The transgenic T cell infused fresh day harvest do last three patient within protocol , prior , thaw cryopreserved cell infuse . Following adoptive cell transfer , patient receive MART-1.26-35 peptide-pulsed dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine low dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . The MART-1 F5 TCR provide Dr. Stephen A. Rosenberg Surgery Branch , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . The MART-1 F5 TCR derive DMF5 tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) clone , select several MART-1-specific TCRs high affinity biological activity . This TCR deliver retroviral vector currently clinical test Surgery Branch/NCI . Both NCI clinical trial trial UCLA base retrovirus express MART-1 F5 TCR use transduce whole PBMC re-infused patient non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy condition regimen . Major difference clinical trial include short ex vivo expansion TCR transduce PBMC , use MART-126-35 peptide pulse DC use positron image tomography ( PET ) non-invasive image adoptively transfer TCR transgenic cell UCLA clinical trial . The primary endpoint safety , feasibility objective tumor response . The phase II clinical trial design two treatment stage follow Simon optimal two-stage clinical phase II clinical trial design 1 . The clinical trial initial stage 8 patient follow second stage 22 patient . Safety determine stage one , 3 8 patient MART-1 F5 TCR-induced dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , accrual warrant . Feasibility also determine first stage , 3 8 patient receive intend cellular therapy , result suboptimal TCR transgenic cell vivo persistence , accrual warrant protocol currently design . Objective tumor response determine RECIST objective response criterion design rule 10 % response rate null hypothesis , 35 % response rate alternative hypothesis . With statistical design , 2 8 patient stage one objective response , study proceed stage two accrue total 22 patient . If 5 patient overall study complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) , combine result objective response rate , study declare positive . Secondary study endpoint transgenic T cell persistence human ability home MART-1 positive melanoma metastasis . Analysis perform sample peripheral blood tumor deposit T cell persistence non-invasive metabolic image use PET scan .</detailed_description>
