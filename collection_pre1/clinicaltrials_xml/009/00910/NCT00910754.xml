	<brief_title>A QT/QTc Multi-Dose Pharmacokinetic Study Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study evaluate effect abiraterone acetate plus prednisone conduction electric charge within heart male patient diagnose metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( progressive form prostate cancer spread part body ) . At various time point outline protocol Day -1 Cycle 1 Day 2 Cycle 2 , patient electrocardiograms extract 24 hour holter-monitor evaluate electrical activity heart . Efficacy assess accord Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criterion . Serial blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis ( drug concentration change time ) collect safety monitor throughout study . Patients take 1000 mg abiraterone acetate daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily orally ( mouth ) disease progression follow 60 month .</detailed_description>
