	<brief_title>Intraoperative Radiotherapy Rectal Cancer Using Photon Radiosurgery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer usually manage combination surgery x−ray treatment ( radiotherapy ) . The standard way deliver radiotherapy external 'beams ' direct tumour site . However , although rectal cancer treatment effective , patient often troubled late side effect . An alternative option deliver x−rays time surgery . This known intraoperative radiotherapy , IORT , number technique already try . There new IORT technology know Photon Radiosurgery System ( PRS ) use treat breast brain cancer . Our experience date inform u IORT x−ray source safe effective . We would like use technology treat rectal cancer believe may improve disease outcomes without side effect associate standard radiotherapy . We would also like study biological process follow radiation . It understood people sensitive x−ray treatment others . If knew reason might able individualise treatment .</detailed_description>
