	<brief_summary>The Presbyopia Algorithm subject study specifically develop prospectively generate treatment file Technolas 217z100 laser provide Presbyopia correction among eye primary hyperopia hyperopic astigmatism ( distance correction ) . The treatment algorithm provide bilateral , multifocal ablation center near addition , thereby allow good focus range object distance .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must least 18 year old Subjects must read , understand , sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subjects must willing able return schedule follow visit . Subjects must willing eye treat visit . Subjects must +4 diopter ( D ) absolute spherical hyperopia ( spherical equivalent ) , +2.5 D refractive astigmatism ( NOT corneal astigmatism ) manifest subjective refraction eye . The spherical equivalent must +5.25 D. Subjects must presbyopia determine agerelated need optical aid ( &gt; +1.50 D ) read best distance correction . Subjects contact lens wearer must gas permeable ( GP ) lenses discontinue least 3 week soft lens discontinue least 1 week prior preoperative evaluation eye treat . Contact lens wearer wear contact lens amount time preoperative baseline examination operative visit must treat . Corneal topography normal . Subjects contact lens wearer must 2 central keratometry reading 2 manifest subjective refraction take preoperatively least one week apart . The refraction value must differ 0.50D defined manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) . The keratometry value must differ previous value 0.50D either meridian . High contrast , manifest , best spectaclecorrected logMAR distance visual acuity ( VA ) must correctable least 0.1 ( 20/25 6/7.5 ) eye . Subjects combination baseline corneal thickness plan operative parameter LASIK procedure would result less 250 micron remain posterior corneal thickness flap postoperatively . Eyes baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibit difference great 0.75D sphere power , difference great 0.50D cylinder power , difference cylinder axis 15 degree compare baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction . For manifest cylinder less 0.75D , difference cylinder axis take consideration . Subjects preoperative assessment ocular topography indicate one eye suitable candidate treatment base upon suggest computersimulated treatment plan . Any subject go comanaged ophthalmologist optometrist approve Technolas GmbH Excimer laser Investigator . Subjects anterior segment pathology , include dry eye syndrome cataract Investigator 's opinion , would interfere best spectaclecorrected VA ( BSCVA ) successful treatment . Subjects evidence retinal vascular disease . Subjects residual , recurrent , active ocular disease , corneal abnormality Investigator 's opinion would interfere BSCVA successful treatment . Subjects sign keratoconus . Subjects unstable central keratometry reading irregular mire . Subjects undergone previous intraocular corneal surgery kind , include type excimer laser surgery either refractive therapeutic purpose . Subjects history Herpes simplex Herpes zoster keratitis . Subjects history glaucoma glaucoma suspect . Subjects immunocompromised carry diagnosis connective tissue disease , clinically significant atopic disease , diabetes , autoimmune disease acute chronic illness increase risk subject confound outcome study . Subjects take systemic medication likely affect wound heal corticosteroid antimetabolite . Subjects know pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course study . Subjects know sensitivity medication use standard LASIK . Subjects participate ophthalmic clinical trial clinical trial . Subjects ocular muscle disorder include strabismus nystagmus , disorder affect fixation . Subjects risk angle closure . Exclusion CriteriaFor Fellow ( Second ) Eyes Simultaneous Bilateral Treatment Procedures : Flap complication first eye 's surgery free cap , partial flap , thin flap , irregular flap . Epithelial defect exceed 2mm x 2mm dimension , clinically significant debris interface flap underlie stroma first eye . Severe blepharospasm first eye may prevent impeded completion keratectomy and/or laser ablation procedure . Poor subject cooperation instruction first eye 's surgery and/or poor subject fixation laser fixation target . Aborted LASIK procedure first eye PRK EpiLASIK perform first eye LASIK possible .</criteria>
