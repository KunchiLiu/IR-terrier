	<criteria>Subjects NSTEMI , define : symptom ( e.g . chest pain , dyspnea ) consistent acute coronary syndrome , last least 10 minute , recent symptom occur within 24 hour prior presentation , without persistent STsegment elevation admission 12lead ECG , Troponin ( T I ) upper limit normal ( ULN ) local institution within 18 hour presentation . Subject able randomize within 18 hour presentation . Subjects manage early invasive strategy , PCI likely occur least 2 hour start dose [ subject undergo PCI withdrawn study ] . Male female subject 45 year age older . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) great 40 MlU/ml estradiol le 40 pg/ml ( le 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ) , childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list protocol duration dose first followup visit ( approximately 2 week post lastdose ) . Negative urine serum pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication first followup visit ( approximately 2 week post lastdose ) . QTcB QTcF great 530 msec . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . History severe heart failure define NYHA class III IV know severe LV dysfunction [ ejection fraction le 30 % ] regardless symptomatic status . Suspected aortic dissection . Severe aortic stenosis severe valvular disease . Current known lifethreatening condition vascular disease ( e.g . severe chronic airway disease ) may prevent subject complete study . Subjects rheumatoid arthritis , connective tissue disorder condition know associate active chronic acute inflammation ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease , osteomyelitis , pneumonia , etc. ) . Intermittent condition treat shortterm oral antibiotic ( e.g . typical URI ) condition currently exacerbate ( e.g . gout current flair ) may include . History myopathy rhabdomyolysis . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Known Hepatitis B Hepatitis C positive . Current anticipated use systemic steroid ( oral IV ) . Inhaled , intranasal topical steroid allow . A single prophylactic dose systemic steroid allow time PCI subject contrast allergy . Current anticipated use BCRP substrates narrow therapeutic index ( e.g . daunorubicin , doxorubicin , topotecan , mitoxantrone ) . Previously diagnosed cancer complete remission least 5 year . Localized carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix resect ablated cure exclusionary.. Known alcohol drug abuse within past 6 month . Previous exposure GW856553 . Use another investigational product within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose IP current study . Any subject Investigator deems unsuitable study ( e.g. , due either medical reason , laboratory abnormality , expect study medication noncompliance ) . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Previous MI coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . History kidney transplant history contrast nephropathy . Contraindication MRI scanning ( assessed local MRI safety questionnaire ) include limited : intracranial aneurysm clip metallic object ; history intraorbital metal fragment remove MD ; pacemaker nonMR compatible heart valve ; inner ear implant ; history claustrophobia MR. Allergy MRI contrast enhancement agent ( gadolinium ) . Estimated creatinine clearance CockcroftGault formula &lt; 30 mL/min .</criteria>
