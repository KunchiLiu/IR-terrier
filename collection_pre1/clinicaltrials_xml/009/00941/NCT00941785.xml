	<brief_title>Dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) -Piperaquine IPT Prevent Malaria Children Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence several study area transmission malaria seasonal , use IPT reduce substantially incidence clinical malaria child age five year , much 90 % ( Greenwood et al , Trends Parasitology 24 ( 11 ) :485-6 , 2008 ) . The effective regimen SP+AQ alternative regimen need amodiaquine poorly tolerate ( Sokhna et al PlosOne 3 : e1471 , 2008 ) resistance SP increase . In recent trial Senegal The Gambia , PQ combine DHA SP effective malaria , well tolerate , SP+AQ . Of regimen , DHA+PQ license use antimalarial African country . However data pharmacokinetics PQ use IPT child , impact DHA+PQ prevent spread resistance know . This trial aim provide information order evaluate suitability DHA+PQ use seasonal IPT child determine optimum dose regimen piperaquine . Malaria ( cause primarily Plasmodium falciparum ) endemic southern third Burkina Faso , occur seasonally June November , case occur August October . In Burkina Faso evidence recent decline malaria incidence see African country . Although policy treat uncomplicated malaria artemisin combination , practice chloroquine remain treatment use health facility . Several study show seasonal IPT child ( IPTc ) provide high degree protection clinical malaria . SP+AQ effective regimen amodiaquine well tolerate resistance SP increase n many area . Alternative regimen require . Piperaquine ( PQ ) , long act antimalarial use prophylaxis China , suitable use IPT . In study Senegal The Gambia piperaquine plus SP dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) effective well tolerate SP+AQ . The purpose study determine whether DHA-PQ effective SP+AQ prevent spread drug resistant parasite genotype determine pharmacokinetics piperaquine child receive drug IPT . Little known pharmacokinetics piperaquine recently , currently limit information pharmacokinetics piperaquine child . The pharmacokinetic data study allow u estimate optimum dose regimen piperaquine ; current recommend regimen DHA-PQ three dos three day . For IPT , single dose regimen highly desirable would easier deliver well accept community . 1500 child age 3 59 month enrol randomize receive 3 monthly administration DHA-PQ SP-AQ , August , September October . From August November child visit twice weekly check malaria symptom . A subset 45 child treatment group ask provide venous blood sample day 0 7 analysis biochemical haematological parameter . In DHA-PQ group , subset 210 child ask provide finger prick blood sample PK analysis day 0 , day 0 day 6 , day 7 , day 8 day 30 . To calibrate measurement drug concentration peripheral blood exist PK model , month 17 child ask also provide venous sample ( 2ml take vacutainer ) three occasion ( one day 0 6 , one day 7 , one day 8 30 ) . In addition , separate group 750 child age 3 59 month recruit surveyed end transmission season determine prevalence malaria parasitaemia drug-resistance parasite genotype study area .</detailed_description>
