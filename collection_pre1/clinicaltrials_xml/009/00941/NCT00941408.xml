	<brief_summary>This protocol aim create tissue bank breast tumor obtain time diagnosis identification biomarkers diagnosis , prognostication , prediction treatment response breast cancer . While tissue bank exist major hospital Singapore collect tumor specimen time surgery , specimen collect surgery patient undergone pre-operative treatment represent post-treatment sample baseline , untreated sample . Such sample intrinsically different untreated sample , analyze separately untreated sample . However , remain valuable sample , particularly pre-treatment sample obtain , provide pair pre- post-treatment sample , could provide valuable information treatment-related tumor biomarker change . A tissue bank comprise sample collect diagnostic core biopsy thus represent valuable supplement exist tissue bank . Approximately 10-20 % patient diagnose non-metastatic breast cancer require neoadjuvant chemotherapy . In addition , future clinical trial may include 'window-of-opportunity ' study biological therapy administer short period ( 2-3 week ) operable breast cancer patient await definitive surgery . The majority early-stage breast cancer patient would eligible trial , allow rapid recruitment breast cancer patient . When coupled analysis surrogate marker response ( eg apoptosis , anti-angiogenic effect , etc ) , unique clinical trial could provide valuable insight biological effect new therapeutic agent evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abstract Research Proposal : Breast cancer heterogeneous disease , various subtypes demonstrate differ biological behavior , prognosis , response therapeutic agent . Improving understand biology breast cancer result good prognostication therapy individual patient , important clinical implication . While valuable scientific knowledge generate study breast cancer cell line animal model , information generate vitro may fully reflect vivo model . Direct analysis patient sample important validate vitro finding , represent step closer clinical application . Studying patient tumor sample genetic protein marker correlate analysis clinical characteristic outcome could provide valuable insight tumor biology vivo , lead well understanding tumor biology resistance mechanism . This single-centre study biomarker analysis breast tumor . A total 400 patient breast lesion diagnostic core biopsy plan enrol 2 year . During diagnostic tumor core biopsy , 3-4 additional tumor sample obtain needle track purpose study . The tumor core store liquid nitrogen subsequent histopathological analysis ; DNA , RNA protein extract tumor core genetic , gene expression proteomics study . The patient 's clinical progress track clinical case file . For patient clinical diagnostic biopsy yield benign result , sample obtain serve control specimen . For patient clinical diagnostic core biopsy confirm diagnosis breast cancer , sample consider case , follow information track : histopathological characteristic tumor include ER/PR/c-erbB2 status know prognostic predictive immunohistochemical marker ( e.g. , Ki67 , p53 , etc ) , anti-cancer treatment , progression-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
