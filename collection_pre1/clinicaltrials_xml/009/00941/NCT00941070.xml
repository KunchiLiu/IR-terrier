	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study triapine cisplatin give together radiation therapy work treat patient cervical cancer vaginal cancer . Triapine may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving triapine together cisplatin may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine three-month fast F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET/CT ) image complete metabolic response define European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) PET study group . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6-month progression-free survival rate calculate date first treatment date disease progression , relapse , death . II . To quantitate change pre-treatment standard uptake value ( SUV ) PET/CT post-treatment PET/CT disease progression PET/CT . III . To quantitate pre-treatment , treatment 3-mo post-treatment grade 2 high gastrointestinal , genitourinary , sexual function toxicity result Triapine® , cisplatin , radiation therapy measure CTCAE v3.0 , utilized December 31 , 2010 ; CTCAE v4.0 utilized begin January 1 , 2011 . IV . To associate smoking habit ( non-smoker , smoker quit therapy , smoker ) 3-mo post-treatment PET/CT metabolic response 3-mo best overall clinical response measure RECIST criterion Triapine® , cisplatin , radiation therapy . V. To associate HPV non-HPV sub-type cervical cancer 3-mo post-treatment PET/CT metabolic response 3-mo best overall clinical response measure RECIST criterion Triapine® , cisplatin , radiation therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord brachytherapy treatment ( plan intracavitary brachytherapy v none ) . Patients receive cisplatin IV 90 minute day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 , 30 triapine IV day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 33 . Patients also undergo pelvic external beam radiotherapy 5 day week week 1-5 . Patients may undergo parametrial boost radiation intracavitary low-dose high-dose rate brachytherapy clinically indicate . Patients undergo whole-body F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT imaging baseline , 3 month completion study treatment , disease progression . Patients complete Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire smoking behavior questionnaire baseline , 3 month completion study treatment , disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
