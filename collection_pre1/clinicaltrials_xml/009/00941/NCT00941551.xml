	<brief_title>Thyroid Lobectomy With Without Levothyroxine Treatment Postoperatively</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It commonly accept patient benign nodular thyroid disease undergo operative therapy , surgical resection consist lobectomy patient disease limit one lobe . Contralateral disease exclude case preoperative palpation , ultrasonography neck , intraoperative palpation . On hand , preferred operative procedure bilateral nodular thyroid disease total thyroidectomy . Such treatment strategy minimize risk development recurrent disease diminishes risk complication reoperation recurrent nodular thyroid disease become necessary . The recurrence rate unilateral thyroidectomy benign nodular goiter perform expert surgeon report vary 10 % 26 % . Potential risk factor recurrence nodular goiter evaluate many study include : young age presentation , female gender , positive family history goiter , long duration symptom , mutinodularity thyroid disease , high volume leave thyroid tissue . However , study evaluate incidence recurrent nodular disease retrospective , difficult determine whether recurrence represent de novo nodule formation previously normal thyroid remnant progression residual disease leave initial operation . It well know fact , patient thyroid lobectomy euthyroid ( 60 % -90 % ) require thyroid hormone replacement therapy . However , important question whether thyroid hormone administration postoperatively prevent recurrent nodular thyroid disease euthyroid hemithyroidectomized patient ? The aim present randomize study compare prevalence recurrent nodular goiter contralateral thyroid lobe among patient unilateral thyroid lobectomy unilateral multinodular goiter ( MNG ) receive versus receive prophylactic levothyroxine ( LT4 ) treatment postoperatively five-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
