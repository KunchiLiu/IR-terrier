	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass chemotherapy use docetaxel cytoxan ( TC ) hormonal therapy use exemestane shrink size breast tumor allow preserve breast less extensive surgery breast . Additionally , receive chemotherapy hormonal therapy surgery , able determine treatment receive effective treating cancer . Prior enter study , special test , call Oncotype DX assay , perform small amount cancer biopsy time diagnose breast cancer , determine likelihood cancer benefit shrink chemotherapy hormonal therapy . You eligible enter study recurrence score cancer determine use Oncotype DX assay less equal 24 . Patients hormone receptor-positive breast cancer recurrence score less equal 24 previously demonstrate obtain large benefit hormonal therapy , compare chemotherapy , agent give surgery . The ability hormonal agent chemotherapy shrink cancer prior surgery specifically examine hormone receptor-positive cancer recurrence score less equal 24 .</detailed_description>
