	<brief_summary>Aims Research Proposal : 1 . To build DNA bank association comprehensive database treatment outcomes toxicity cancer patient . 2 . To carry genotyping potential candidate gene relation specific anti-cancer agent correlate genotype treatment outcome toxicity . The investigator hypothesize genetic variation different individual ethnic group may account inter-individual inter-ethnic difference treatment response toxicities anti-cancer therapy . The understanding contribution genetic variation may help individualize therapy optimize treatment outcome reduce toxicity . Patients recruit National University Hospital Cancer Centre . Any individual age 18 diagnosed cancer eligible . 20 ml blood collect subject DNA extraction pharmacogenetics analysis . At time recruitment , demographic characteristic , cancer history , past present cancer treatment history study subject collect . The patient ' progress follow periodically ( approximately every 6 month ) medical record , subsequent cancer treatment , progression cancer , survival outcome update . Follow-up occur death . Important treatment information collect include drug regimen , drug dos , intent treatment , aematologic non-haematologic toxicity , hospitalization episode may relate treatment . Known functional single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) drug metabolize enzyme , transporter target different anti-cancer agent characterize . More comprehensive genotyping carry 'outliers ' experience exceptional toxicity biological response identify novel functional SNPs use high throughput sequence technique . Correlation make genotype treatment-related outcome ( tumor response , progression-free survival ) toxicity . For selected patient , lymphoblastoid transformation carry maintain infinite supply DNA .</brief_summary>
