	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn transfer donor 's NK cell , combination antibody call epratuzumab low-dose interleukin ( IL-2 ) , body do safely . Researchers want find infused NK cell survive infusion NK cell infusion help destroy cancer cell recipient 's body possibly help control disease . Primary Objectives : · Evaluate feasibility collect adequate number natural killer ( NK ) cell donor evaluate safety haploidentical donor-derived NK cell infusion , Epratuzumab , low-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Secondary Objectives : - Quantification persistence infuse donor NK cell vivo ; - Quantification persistence cytokine level ; - Assessment NK cell immunophenotype function ; - Correlate anti-tumor effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical Natural Killer ( NK ) Cells With Epratuzumab Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Epratuzumab design attach certain protein surface ALL cell . This may cause cancer cell die . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth . This may cause cancer cell die . Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may increase likelihood cell die . IL-2 design help NK cell live long work well . Experimental Therapy : NK cell cell body fight disease infection . NK cell may destroy tumor cell , particularly NK cell `` mismatch '' certain protein , call human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) . Researchers think ability destroy tumor cell predict learn donor 's recipient 's HLA type see mismatch , check specialized protein find surface donor 's NK cell . These protein call killer immunoglobulin receptor ( KIR ) . The NK cell collect donor 's blood process lab M. D. Anderson , researcher use machine , call CliniMACS device , separate NK cell rest donor 's collect white blood cell treat overnight drug call IL-2 . This do make NK cell strong give recipient . You also receive IL-2 injection skin try help NK cell survive long possibly increase number NK cell body infusion . Screening Tests : Before start treatment study , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform : - You bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn needle . - You spinal tap check status disease . A spinal tap ( also call lumbar puncture ) special needle insert low back space bone draw sample fluid surround spinal cord . - You pulse oximetry test measure heart rate level oxygen blood . To perform test , clothespin-shaped device place finger 1 minute . - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This blood also check infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . You tell result test . If infection , may able take part study . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw test HLA KIR . You donor told result test . - Females able child must negative blood pregnancy test . This test perform blood drawn routine test describe . If enough blood leftover test , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn . These screen test , except HLA KIR-typing , would also need repeat additional leukapheresis procedure do part study , order see continue eligible another one performed . Identifying Eligible Donor : Your relative test see KIR type `` mismatch '' researcher think help donor 's NK cell target cancer cell body . They must also share half HLA gene eligible take part study . The donor 's blood also check infection , HIV , protect possibility transmit infection NK cell infusion . To help track NK cell infusion , researcher prefer ( require ) female recipient , donor male male recipient , donor female . Epratuzumab Administration : If donor find eligible take part study , Day -4 ( 4 day NK cell infusion ) Day -1 ( 1 day NK cell infusion ) , epratuzumab infusion . The length time infusion take different patient . This do use indwell catheter ( tube remain vein , tunneled arm chest continuously inject drain part body ) . If already indwell catheter place , need new one place . However , new catheter need , ask sign separate inform consent form placement . On Day -1 ( 1 day NK cell infusion ) Days 3 , 6 , 10 , 13 , 17 , receive epratuzumab infusion . This take several hour . Conditioning Phase : This phase start within 28 day screen test . During phase , receive chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine weaken immune system order help infuse NK cell survive . You stay hospital Day -6 NK cell infusion longer doctor think necessary . On Day -6 Day -2 , receive fludarabine 1 time day vein , 30 minute time . On Days -5 -4 , receive cyclophosphamide 1 time day vein , 2 hour time . On Days -5 -4 , receive mesna 5 time per day vein , 15 minute time . Mesna give protect bladder side effect may cause cyclophosphamide . Cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , mesna infuse indwelling catheter . Infusion NK cell : On Day 0 , receive NK cell vein , preferably indwell catheter . If indwelling catheter , may receive infusion intravenously ( IV -- vein ) . The doctor decide amount NK cell infuse , affect long infusion last . Usually infusion last le 1 hour . To help prevent allergic reaction infuse NK cell ( fever chill ) , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) vein , 15-30 minute , Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth . You also receive fluid vein help decrease risk kidney damage . If study doctor think necessary , may also receive steroid help prevent side effect . If doctor think eligible receive NK cell infusion Day 0 , take study without receive donor 's NK cell . The collected NK cell thrown away . This study allow eligible recipient age 2 year age participate . You and/or caregiver train give IL-2 injection . This drug inject skin 9 dos . You take 3 dos per week 3-week period receive NK cell . Measuring NK Cell Survival Through Blood Test : On Day 0 ( NK cell infusion 2 hour later ) , 1 time follow day : Days 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , blood ( 4 teaspoon time ) drawn test see long NK cell survive body . If disease get bad infused NK cell longer see , blood draw schedule may stop early . Follow-Up Visits : You follow-up visit least 3 time per week first 3 week , 1 time 28 day NK cell infusion . Then , additional follow-up visit Months 2 3 . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You change medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Days 14 28 , Months 2 3 , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration . Length Study : You remain active study 3 month follow NK cell infusion agree perform . This investigational study . Cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , mesna , IL-2 FDA approve commercially available . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine approve treat leukemia adult . IL-2 FDA-approved , treatment leukemia . Epratuzumab FDA approve commercially available . It use research . The use CliniMACS machine infuse NK cell combine epratuzumab patient ALL do research . Up 10 recipient 10 donor take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
