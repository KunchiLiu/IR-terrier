	<detailed_description>As nation continue battle overweight obesity , prevalence diabetes precipitously increase , place additional financial burden country . Therefore , find way manage chronic disease essential . While self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) show effective improve glycemic control individual type 1 diabetes , importance encouraging individual type 2 diabetes engage SMBG well blood glucose ( BG ) still unclear . SMBG believe key self-management diabetes , provide feedback dietary activity behavior believe impact BG . The use SMBG adjust behavior impact BG self-regulatory approach diabetes management . Self-regulation BG theorize impact self-efficacy management diabetes . Through great self-efficacy , great compliance diabetes self-management behavior achieve . Currently , trial examine use self-regulation approach use current dietary physical activity recommendation individual type 2 diabetes insulin . Thus , investigation involve 12-week study examine effect SR intervention SM intervention . All participant investigation receive standard 12-week behavioral intervention . The intervention include reduce caloric prescription ( 1200-1500 kcal/day ) , fat gram prescription ( 30 % less kcals fat ) , carbohydrate gram prescription ( 150-190 grams/day ) physical activity goal ( slowly build 150minutes/week moderate-intense physical activity end study ) . Participants assess 0 13 week ( pre- post-intervention ) measure fast blood glucose , self-efficacy , diabetes self-management activity . Additionally , dietary intake , physical activity , quality life body weight measurement take 0 13 week comparison two treatment group .</detailed_description>
