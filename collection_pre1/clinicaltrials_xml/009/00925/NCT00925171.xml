	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , preventable treatable condition , major healthcare problem huge human economic cost . It affect 3 million people , result 1.4 million consultation , cause 30,000 death , cost Â£800M per year UK . Considerable research expenditure devote find new expensive intervention . However pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) available therapeutic option good evidence benefit patient term quality life daily function . The primary objective study evaluate effectiveness cost effectiveness addition maintenance programme follow pulmonary rehabilitation patient COPD compare standard care . The secondary objective identify baseline characteristic predict improvement pulmonary rehabilitation programme adherence maintenance strategy . By measure series demographic , clinical , physiological , psychological biochemical parameter researcher hope able predict patient likely receive great benefit pulmonary rehabilitation .
