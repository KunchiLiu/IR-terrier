	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulant see large popularity due ease administration proven benefit variety condition . In examination patient Manitoba , 7.2 % elderly population treat warfarin therapy , proportion likely similar across Canada . For atrial fibrillation , dose warfarin titrate use INR guide target 2.0-3.0 , therapeutic range significant evidence decrease thromboembolic event minimize risk major hemorrhage2 . Other indication anticoagulation therapy include presence mechanical heart valve , history deep vein thrombose pulmonary embolism ( ) , pro-thrombotic condition . Ever since introduction warfarin routine clinical practice , maintenance therapeutic INR patient proven difficult task , patient spend average 57-66 % time within therapeutic range . As majority patient Canada treat primary care provider , busy family physician must keep watchful eye INR value , constantly change due diet vary amount Vitamin K , mention effect interact drug confounders . In attempt find alternative strategy anticoagulation treatment several randomize control trial undertake last two decade examine idea `` Patient Self-Management '' ( PSM ) anticoagulation . In scheme similar diabetic monitor blood glucose value alter insulin dosage , patient trial teach self-test INR value use home electronic device adjust warfarin dos accordingly . Data publish show improve control therapeutic range decrease complication rate thromboembolic event major hemorrhage . There significant decrease mortality study , although power detect sample size small ( 49-737 participant ) . In 2006 systematic review meta-analysis 14 randomize control trial ( RCT 's ) publish involve 3049 participant compare `` Patient Self-Monitoring '' ( ie . adjustment dose ) and/or PSM standard management Data seven PSM study include demonstrated significant decrease thromboembolic event , non-significant decrease major hemorrhagic event , significant decrease mortality . Furthermore , show patient satisfied PSM strategy . These data reflect American College Chest Physicians guideline entitle Pharmacology Management Vitamin K Antagonists , `` In patient suitably select trained , PST [ patient self-testing ] PSM effective alternative treatment model . We suggest therapeutic management implement suitable '' . In attempt compare success anticoagulation control arena , Walraven associate examine 67 study involve 50 208 patient 57 154 patient-years anticoagulation clinic , clinical trial , community practises . Study investigator examine many variable may influence difference therapeutic control conclude study set great predictor . They quote follow rate anticoagulation success : PSM 72 % , RCT 's 66 % , anticoagulation clinic 66 % , community primary care clinic 57 % . It also show PSM associate significant improvement anticoagulation control . In consider practise family medicine Canada , two fact regard anticoagulation control apparent : ( ) family physician shoulder majority treatment responsibility ; ( b ) control likely optimal . PSM RCT 's show improve therapeutic control patient compare `` usual care '' 5,7 also care anticoagulation clinic tertiary care hospital . This improved control show associate improve clinically relevant endpoint . Thus , would logical suggest implement PSM strategy Canadian primary care setting would greatest return . There several problem logic though . Firstly , RCT 's involved extensive training session nurse clinician specialize physician tertiary care centre educate participant fundamental warfarin therapy adjustment regime . These resource simply available family physician . Secondly , `` point care '' electronic INR test device provide patient , would cost average patient approximately $ 1000 add cost test strip . OBJECTIVE It purpose small study determine feasibility implement PSM strategy average Canadian primary care practise . STUDY DESIGN The study involve patient single family private practise Chilliwack , BC . It carry randomize , unblinded cross-over trial duration eight month ( four month per arm ) . All patient practise interest consider study evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion well desire participate . Criteria participation base design mention study show benefit PSM . 20 patient randomize two group use computer randomizer . Group A assign PSM duration four month switch physician-management remain four month study . Group B follow oppose schedule . Patients PSM group obtain INR value community laboratory adjust Warfarin dose . Dosage adjustment guide dose adjustment nomogram ( provided patient ) base recommendation BC Guidelines Protocols Advisory Committee . Data PSM compare result physician-management also accept value community anticoagulation control literature . INTERVENTION All patient consider study introduce idea PSM theory behind anticoagulation normal office visit physician approximately half hour . The consent form also explain give patient . They return follow-up approximately one week consider undertaking . If participation desire consent obtain patient randomize either group A group B . Patients group A task manage warfarin therapy use provided nomogram . Patients group B continue manage physician . In second office visit patient tell group randomize group A instruct use warfarin adjustment nomogram provide . After four month group switch alternate management strategy . This time group B instruct use nomograms office visit . Patients group use warfarin tablet two dosage strength , 1 mg 5 mg. All INR test do community laboratory result make available patient dosage adjustment , well physician . The physician 's office available appointment phone call study subject discuss support process time . RESULTS All INR result forward community physician 's office thereby record data determine proportion value therapeutic range . Statistical calculation do accord accepted practice analysis cross-over study researcher experience statistical analysis . Patients give structure treatment-related quality life survey PSM phase explore topic general treatment satisfaction , self-efficacy , strain social network , daily hassle , distress . The survey consist 32 question previously describe validated.4 Other outcome include office visit utilized issue PSM , complication sub- supra-therapeutic coagulation record . Secondary outcome expect significant due limit power study .</detailed_description>
