	<brief_summary>CCTG 590 open-label study evaluate impact therapy intensification Maraviroc ( MVC ) ( CCR5 inhibitor ) stable suppressive HIV antiretroviral regimen rate CD4+ T-cell recovery gene expression profile . Patients stable first-line HIV regimen continue viral suppression sub-optimal CD4+ T-cell count eligible study . Those find eligible MVC ( dose-adjusted background HIV regimen ) add current HIV regimen 24 week . After 24 week intensification , MVC discontinue , original antiretroviral regimen continue subject follow additional 12 week . The investigator hypothesize MVC improve rate CD4 recovery . This improved CD4 recovery associate favorable change gene expression profile gene involve CD4 maintenance circulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blunted CD4+ T-cell responses viral control may consequence on-going T-cell destruction regenerative phase CD4 recovery activation-induced apoptosis and/or reduce production decrease thymic output . Maraviroc , CCR5 inhibitor , may improve clinical status HIV-infected two distinct mechanism . First , block HIV entry CD4+ T-cells , CCR5 inhibitor direct antiviral activity . Second , pro-inflammatory state HIV infection up-regulates CCR5 ligands receptor , CCR5 receptor antagonist may abrogate immune activation resultant T-cell apoptosis . Importantly , MVC bind CCR5 receptor without induce intracellular signal alter cell-surface expression . Potentially , MVC intensification viral suppression ART may decrease persistent activation-induced apoptosis improve repair remodel lymphoid tissue lead increase CD4+ T-cell recovery function . The aim study evaluate potentially therapeutic immunomodulatory effect MVC . Several measure immune homeostasis determine study , include functional genomic analysis extend T-cell phenotyping . Genes responsive MVC therapy identify categorized functional group . Based upon exist literature identify gene observe immune response ( change CD4/CD8 subset ) MVC therapy , model CCR5 responsive-genes potential impact immune recovery outline . Potentially , individual experience immune discordance suppressive ART may well treat MVC antiretroviral intensification . 1 . We hypothesize expression decrease among gene involve immune activation ( NF-kB , MAPK , nuclear factor activate T-cells , MYD88 STAT1 ) , apoptosis ( Fas ligand TRAIL ) trafficking/repopulation T-cells ( CCR5 , MIP-1α , MIP-1β RANTES ) increase among gene involve tissue repair ( platelet-derived growth factor , insulin-like growth proteins osteoblast-specific transcription factor ) . 1 . The gene expression profile induce MVC associate favorable increase rate CD4+ T-cell recovery . 2 . The rate CD4 recovery ( cells/month ) great MVC compare . 3 . The proportion cell express activation/ apoptosis marker decrease baseline decrease associate improved CD4 recovery . 4 . The proportion naïve cell increase baseline increase associate improved CD4 recovery . 5 . The rate CD4 recovery great among subject receive PI-containing treatment regimen compare receive NNRTI-containing treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
