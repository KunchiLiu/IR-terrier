	<brief_title>Examining Genetic Predictors Coronary Artery Calcification African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , people die CAD disease , African Americans , particularly woman young men , affect CAD European Americans . One cause CAD atherosclerosis , condition deposit fat , cholesterol , substance build along inner wall artery . Coronary artery calcification occur result atherosclerosis characterize calcium build artery . Non-invasive imaging , include compute tomography ( CT ) scan , coronary artery calcification effective way ass CAD risk . The Genetic Epidemiology Network Arteriopathy ( GENOA ) study , part Family Blood Pressure Program ( FBPP ) , study examine sibling high blood pressure two exam conduct 1995 2004 . The purpose new GENOA study , enroll past GENOA participant , identify genetic factor may lead development coronary artery calcification African Americans . Conducting genetic study African American population result great understanding mechanism atherosclerosis , may lead improved strategy early identification people risk CAD development new treatment CAD . This study enroll people participate second GENOA exam live Jackson , Mississippi . Participants attend one study visit University Mississippi Medical Center . During study visit , participant interview study staff medical family health history ; health behavior ; physical activity level ; use tobacco , alcohol , medication . They complete walk activity task assess memory , think speed , accuracy . Participants also complete questionnaire mood , physical examination , CT scan heart , blood collection . A portion blood store future research study .</detailed_description>
