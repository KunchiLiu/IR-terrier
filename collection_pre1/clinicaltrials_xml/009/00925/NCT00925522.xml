	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Therapy Cool Path Duo Cardiac Ablation System Treatment Ischemic Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT ) common complication ischemic heart disease often life threaten . Ventricular tachycardia define three beat ventricular origin succession rate great 100 beat per minute . There normal QRS complex associate VT , rhythm usually regular . Patients VT experience unpleasant heart palpitation , dyspnea , syncope , decrease overall quality life . They also suffer consequence impaired hemodynamics , loss cardiac efficiency , increase risk sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , account approximately half death patient cardiovascular disease . Historically , antiarrhythmic medication serve first line therapy treatment VT , spite low efficacy high recurrence rate . But recent year , internal cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) become treatment choice . Although , ICDs effective terminating arrhythmia , rarely without episode require poorly tolerate shock therapy . Ablative therapy offer important option frequent control potential long-term VT elimination . Radiofrequency catheter ablation offer ability provide immediate control recurrent VT . Since early 2000 's , strategy , tool , technique improve identify key ablation site deliver effective lesion . Radiofrequency ablation successful treating arrhythmia . With non irrigated technology difficult ablate ischemic VT . This may due inadequate lesion size . Irrigated electrodes developed create large lesion . Open irrigation catheter tip produce large lesion , also help reduce risk coagulum ( clot ) char due high temperature .</detailed_description>
