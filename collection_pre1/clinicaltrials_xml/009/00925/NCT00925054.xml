	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether weekly injection phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( rAvPAL-PEG ) reduce blood phenylalanine concentration PKU subject whether repeat administration safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Finding Study Evaluate Safety , Efficacy , &amp; Tolerability Multiple Doses rAvPAL-PEG Subjects With PKU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2 part , Phase 2 , open-label dose-finding study approximately 35 subject PKU . Seven dose cohort plan , consist 5 subject . In Part 1 , plan start dose level test PAL 001 ( 0.001 , 0.003 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 1.0 mg/kg ) , provide dose limiting toxicity observe PAL 001 . In Parts 1 2 , study drug administer clinic staff . Subjects complete participation PAL 001 receive priority participate PAL 002. rAvPAL PEG naïve subject enrol fill dose cohort vacancy result subject complete PAL 001 choose continue PAL 002 . In addition , number dose cohort determine PAL 001 less 7 , additional naïve subject may add exist dose cohort provide total approximately 35 subject enter Part 1 PAL 002 . Furthermore , serial dosing cohort Part 1 PAL 002 stop , additional subject ( either naïve subject PAL 001 subject ) may add exist cohort total study enrollment approximately 35 subject . In case , additional subject enrol sequentially low high dose cohort . Diet alter course study , except necessary safety . Subjects evaluate safety blood Phe concentration throughout study . Toxicity measure accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 3 . A Data Monitoring Committee monitor study .</detailed_description>
