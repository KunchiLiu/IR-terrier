	<brief_summary>If residual breast cancer find breast lymph node tissue remove preoperative chemotherapy , one may increase risk breast cancer recurrence future . The purpose research study determine additional treatment preoperative chemotherapy surgery bevacizumab metronomic chemotherapy would make difference reduce participant chance breast cancer recurrence compare standard care , observation alone . This study evaluate potential additional benefit participate exercise dietary intervention compare dietary intervention alone . Bevacizumab antibody make laboratory . Bevacizumab work differently way chemotherapy drug work . Bevacizumab work slow stop growth cell cancer tumor decrease blood supply tumor . Bevacizumab approve U.S Food Drug Administration treat advance colorectal , lung kidney cancer . Metronomic chemotherapy also attack tumor blood supply . Standard chemotherapy drug use , cyclophosphamide methotrexate ( CM ) , small daily dos mouth , well threshold cause people feel sick . Previous research study show woman breast cancer take metronomic CM bevacizumab feel well , combination therapy active reduce cancer . Participants study also provide diet diet exercise counsel telephone . Studies show many woman treat breast cancer gain weight treatment , may also experience fatigue weakness . Many study show make change diet increase exercise help prevent weight gain also may increase energy decrease side effect chemotherapy breast cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Because one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one study group : 1 . Diet Intervention arm , 2 . Diet Exercise Intervention Arm , 3 . Bevacizumab , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate diet intervention , 4 . Bevacizumab , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , diet exercise intervention arm . - Participants assign group 1 2 receive diet intervention diet exercise intervention . They see doctor physical examination every 12 week first two year intervention , every 6 month basis . Routine laboratory test do time visit well . Other blood test do measure effect diet exercise intervention begin treatment , 6 month , 1 year start treatment . Additionally , one blood test do begin treatment look hereditary difference gene related metabolism . - Participants assign group 3 4 undergo following : Medication : Participants place bevacizumab cyclophosphamide methotrexate ( CM ) arm receive bevacizumab intravenously every 3 week approximately 6 month , follow every 6 week treatment additional 1.5 year ; cyclophosphamide orally day methotrexate orally twice day first two day week . The treatment CM therapy bevacizumab continue approximately 6 month . Physical Exams : 6 week drug therapy ( 2 cycle ) complete , physical examination frequency reduce every 6 week ( every cycle ) additional 6 cycle . Once 24 week drug therapy ( 8 cycle 6 month since start therapy ) complete , physical examination do every 12 week duration protocol therapy . Blood Tests : chemistry hematology test do prior start Cycles 1 , 2 3 every 6 week ( every cycle ) duration cyclophosphamide methotrexate chemotherapy . After 24 week ( 8 cycle ) drug treatment , hematology/chemistry test frequency reduce every 12 week ( every cycle ) rest bevacizumab treatment . Urine Tests do every cycle duration treatment . Heart function test echocardiogram do 6 month , 1 , 2 , 3 year participant start study . Ultrasound blood vessel do randomized receive bevacizumab CM chemotherapy . This test do baseline completion first second cycle therapy . - Activities Groups : Lifestyle Intervention : All woman study complete number test baseline , 6 12 month . Diet Only Group : Participants assign group ask participate series 13 telephone call course 1 year . Those assigned Diet Exercize Group ( addition information list ) receive counsel target toward increase physical activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer . HER2 positive disease allow . Metastatic breast cancer ( Stage IV ) allow . For patient enter trial neoadjuvant chemotherapy , must presence residual invasive disease pathologic review follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Residual disease define MillerPayne response breast 04 and/or residual carcinoma one regional lymph node would meet AJCC 7th edition criterion N1 N3 disease . The presence DCIS without invasion qualify residual disease . Alternatively , MillerPayne grade available , patient eligible pathology report indicate residual invasive carcinoma follow neoadjuvant therapy . If tumor triple negative ( ER/PR/HER2 ) patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy , disease may clinical stage IIII preoperatively , per AJCC 7th edition , base baseline evaluation clinical examination and/or breast imaging . Patients must presence residual invasive disease pathologic review follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . If tumor triple negative patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy , must pathologic lymph node positivity Stage IIB great disease surgery . For purpose eligibility , lymph node positivity refer either axillary intramammary lymph node . If tumor hormone receptor positive , disease must clinical Stage III neoadjuvantly , per AJCC 7th edition , base baseline evaluation clinical examination and/or breast imaging , pathologic Stage IIB great time definitive surgery . Patients hormone receptor positive breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy eligible protocol . For patient complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy , regimen must contain anthracycline , taxane , . Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy part clinical trial acceptable . Protocol therapy must initiate &lt; 180 day last surgery breast cancer . For triple negative patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy , regimen must contain anthracycline taxane . For patient , protocol therapy must initiate &lt; 28 week initiation adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer receive adjuvant hormonal therapy No prior exposure bevacizumab inhibitor angiogenesis allow . Patients must complete definitive resection primary tumor . Negative margin invasive ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) desirable , however positive margin acceptable treatment team believe surgery possible patient receive radiotherapy . Patients margin positive lobular carcinoma situ eligible . Postmastectomy radiotherapy suggest patient primary tumor 5cm great involvement 4 lymph node . Whole breast radiotherapy require patient underwent breast conserve therapy , include lumpectomy , partial mastectomy , excisional biopsy . Patients must presence residual invasive disease pathologic review follow preoperative chemotherapy . The presence DCIS without invasion qualify residual disease . Alternatively , MillerPayne grade available , patient eligible pathology report indicate residual invasive carcinoma follow preoperative therapy .
