	<brief_summary>The research involve establishment cohort include much possible case macrothrombocytopenia relate `` MYH9 syndrome '' study mutation polymorphisms MYH9 gene patient . As MYH9 syndrome autosomal dominant disorder , patient heterozygous MYH9 gene mutation . The main goal project look correlation genotype phenotype . It plan characterize phenotype genotype cohort patient , include family member address study order well understand platelet disorder improve epidemiological knowledge MYH9 syndrome . The data record database .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Definition : Extended description protocol , include information already contain field , comparison ( ) study . The patient participate study suffer suspect suffer MYH9 syndrome . The study MYH9 gene propose patient also parent propositi family member ( child adult ) , whether symptomatic . The relative prove heterozygote MYH9 mutation consider new case therefore include cohort patient . Four group control ( individual affect decrease platelet count ) constitute : A1 : control proplatelets production study A2 : control platelet proteome study B : control MYH9 gene analysis C : control leukocytes immunofluorescence study Patients Patients include 6 site national Reference Center Inherited Platelet Disorders ( CRPP ) signing informed consent form . During visit inclusion ( V1 ) , data usually require diagnosis MYH9 syndrome collect : clinical examination , auditory ocular check , blood test include MYH9 gene analysis , search proteinuria . Among patient MYH9 mutation , limited number recruit second step participate specific study focus consequence MYH9 mutation proplatelets production platelet proteome . The selected patient representative different phenotype MYH9 syndrome . They adults platelet count 50 G / L. A blood sample draw purpose second visit ( V2 ) . An annual control offer year 1 , year 2 year 3 inclusion patient confirm MYH9 syndrome ( MYH9 mutation ) . Each control include : clinical examination record bleeding episode , , past year , blood test , search proteinuria . The last control ( end study ) also include auditory ocular test . Relatives The relative include study signing inform consent form inclusion visit ( VAP ) one 6 site CRPP . During visit , blood sample drawn platelet MYH9 gene study . Controls The control include study signing inform consent 6 site CRPP . During inclusion visit ( VT ) , blood sample drawn platelet MYH9 gene study .</detailed_description>
