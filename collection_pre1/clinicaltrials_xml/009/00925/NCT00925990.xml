	<brief_title>CTS-1027 Interferon-Naive Hepatitis C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 1 million Hepatitis C ( HCV ) patient US fail respond , tolerate , interferon interferon plus ribavirin therapy . Significant adverse effect interferon therapy include bone marrow depression ( reduce white blood cell platelet count ) major psychiatric disorder ( especially depression ) . Ribavirin associate hemolytic anemia minority patient treat . Patients chronic HCV infection low incidence spontaneous viral clearance , progressive disease , continue medical need efficacious safe therapy . There significant unmet medical need therapy HCV patient ( ) tolerate interferon-based treatment . This trial evaluate effect CTS-1027 without ribavirin patient previously untreated interferon include patient major psychiatric disorder , uncontrolled autoimmune disease , patient simply decline treatment .</detailed_description>
