	<brief_summary>At point time approach diagnosis rotator cuff tendon tear consensual . The French surgeon , consider good experience method , preferably use shoulder CT-arthrography . Whereas United States surgeon rather rely MRI MR-arthrography shoulder . However , nobody say three examination precise give best information . We propose carry three examination time large number patient need operated rotator cuff tendon tear compare result examination operative observation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Which Most Reliable Radiologic Examination Diagnosis Rotator Cuff Tendon Tear ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tendon tear principal pathology shoulder . These degenerative tendon lesion due normal age . True complete asymptomatic tear even quite frequently note old subject . However , invalidate . The majority degenerative lesion treat medically . In limited number case , surgical treatment aim reduce mechanical conflict and/or repair tendon necessary . The indication surgical treatment base clinical evaluation radiological assessment . The radiological assessment essential confirm tear also evaluate extent . The type surgery depend anatomic radiologic assessment . It thus possible , event small complete tear , make simple tendon suture transosseous reinsertion . On hand , event large tear tendon retraction , muscular flap reconstruction need . The preoperative radiological assessment base different radiological examination , explore tendon . In United States , MRI mainly use case . In France , CT-arthrography regard standard care high contrast resolution image obtain reliability appear high MRI . The articular puncture necessary perform examination regard country obstacle . The MR-arthrography , consist inject joint low concentration gadolinium , make possible obtain arthrographic effect MRI . This examination give image excellent contrast . It already widespread USA . In France , increasingly large experience , still limit .</detailed_description>
