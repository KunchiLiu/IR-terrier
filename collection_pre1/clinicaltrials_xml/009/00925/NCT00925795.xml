	<brief_summary>HIV infection associate systemic inflammation involve pathogenesis atherosclerosis . Treatment HIV infection may cause lipid profile disturbance consequently , atherosclerosis progression . In general , extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO ) beneficial effect atherosclerosis marker . Our goal examine effect EVOO atherosclerosis marker HIV-treated patient . A controlled randomize cross-over study perform 40 participant . They consume EVOO ROO ( refine olive oil ) two 20 day intervention period , interrupt 14 day wash-out period . Before trial intervention period analyze participant ' blood : ESR , white blood cell count , hsCRP , interleukin-6 , oxidized LDL , glutathione peroxidase , superoxide dismutase , malondialdehyde , triglyceride , total cholesterol , HDL LDL cholesterol , fibrinogen , factor VII von Willebrand factor . We expect improvement parameter three week EVOO consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Extra Virgin Olive Oil Atherosclerosis Biomarkers HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many study beneficial effect extra virgin olive oil atherosclerosis biomarkers . Our study investigates , population HIV-infected patient receive antiretroviral treatment . The main health benefit EVOO attribute high content phenolic compound , favorable effect blood pressure , LDL oxidation , platelet aggregation , endothelial function , oxidative stress . We analyze total phenolic compound ( PC ) different type olive oil decide use EVOO four time high level PC refine olive oil ( ROO ) would use placebo . A randomized crossover control trial perform 40 participant sign informed consent . They randomly divide two group . Each group consume two type olive oil ( EVOO ROO ) two intervention period , different order . That mean group `` A '' consume EVOO first ROO second intervention period . Group `` B '' inversed order olive oil administration . Two intervention period 20 day interrupt wash-out period 14 day . During intervention period participant consume daily dos 50 mL particular olive oil . During wash-out period participant avoid olive olive oil consumption . Before first two intervention period , blood take . Some test do immediately blood sample collection ( glucose , hsCRP , triglyceride , total cholesterol , HDL LDL cholesterol , CBC , ESR ) . For test ( IL-6 , von Willebrand factor , factor VII , oxidate LDL , glutathione peroxidase , superoxide dismutase ) specimens collect stored -80Â°C analysis . As many study show improvement parameter population affect atherosclerosis , could also expect similar effect HIV-infected patient likely develop atherosclerosis , partly HIV-infection partly side effect antiretroviral therapy .</detailed_description>
