The Family Check-Up selective intervention program focus parent . Its goal provide individualize feedback motivate parent make improvement parent practice . A unique strength FCU feedback individualized tailor specific parent skill typically pertain identified adolescent family . We propose evaluate efficacy FCU apply adolescent identify patient ( IP ) sibling close age . Our rationale include sibling close age derive strong empirical base show : 1 ) sibling resemblance alcohol use high environmental factor share sibling account substantial portion variance adolescent alcohol use ; 2 ) specific interactional dynamic sibling relationship ( collusion ) relate teen alcohol use . Dr. Dishion find high-risk family , sibling collusion account variance problem behavior control involvement deviant peer . This connection ineffective parenting strategy sibling relationship dynamic combination create increase risk alcohol use sibling close age . This notion serve foundation examine efficacy sibling-enhanced FCU intervention respect : 1 ) improvement parental communication monitoring ; 2 ) reduction sibling interactive behavior associate alcohol use ; 3 ) reduction alcohol use IP adolescent well sibling currently use alcohol . We test specify mediator FCU efficacy reduce level alcohol use parent level level sibling dynamic . In order determine whether type family-based intervention might helpful intensive FCU , efficacy sibling-enhanced FCU compare parenting psychoeducational program .</detailed_description>
