	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety accuracy IVBG System ( `` System '' ) use track blood glucose insulin treat subject diabetes mellitus in-clinic set 72 hour ( per subject ) . Reference blood glucose measurement collect across entire reportable range System ( e.g. , 40 400 mg/dL ) adequate sample upper low end range . IVBG System accuracy primarily assess relative ISO 15197 criterion ( i.e. , within ±15 mg/dL YSI glucose level &lt; 75 mg/dL , within ±20 % YSI glucose level &gt; 75 mg/dL ) .</brief_summary>
