	<brief_summary>Objectives : The objective single-arm , prospective study perform annual mammography MRI breast cancer screen woman underwent mantle-field irradiation 1970-1995 M. D. Anderson Cancer Center order compare ability MRI standard mammography identify breast cancer . In addition , determine whether combination breast MRI mammography identifies small , earlier-stage tumor , would lead improved cure rate . We also take opportunity determine incidence stage breast cancer high-risk cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Screening After Mantle Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast MRIs : Breast MRIs report high sensitivity mammogram detect early breast cancer , particularly dense breast mammograms effective . Although breast MRIs may add important information provide mammogram , MRI must use selectively . This MRI sensitive may show false positive test ( test show cancer none ) . Study Procedures : If find eligible take part study , follow procedure perform 1 time year . - You breast exam . - You mammogram . A mammogram breast x-ray use detect breast cancer look abnormality breast . - You MRI breast . For MRI , lay stomach large donut-shaped scanner take image breast . If abnormality find , routine follow-up procedure perform . Routine follow-up may include additional imaging scan biopsy . These follow standard care , information collect stored medical record . Length Study : You study 20 year , annual check-ups breast image study M. D. Anderson . You take study change health allow breast mammogram MRI , become pregnant . This investigational study . Up 223 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
