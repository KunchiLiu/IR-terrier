	<brief_summary>Transplantation prefer method treatment end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) child . Over past forty year , use newer immunosuppressive drug decrease risk organ rejection considerably , improve short-term outcome . However , costly complicate life-long treatment regimen also cause serious side effect . This particularly true child , undergo treatment drug time transitioning , physically emotionally , childhood adulthood . These factor lead significantly reduce life-spans , decrease drug regimen adherence , increase need re-transplantation , compare adult . Current immunosuppressive procedure strategy child mimic adult , despite difference two population ' immune system need . New strategy aim tailor individual child 's need would reduce risk complication improve outcomes . The purpose study generate information help change current practice pediatric transplantation one individualize preventative .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past forty year , use increasingly effective immunosuppressive drug decrease risk organ rejection ( acute rejection , AR ) considerably , improve short-term outcome . However , costly complicate life-long treatment regimen also cause serious complication long-term . While transplant recipient live significantly longer live patient dialysis , transplant recipient still much short life span healthy counterpart . Among reason difference life-expectancy immunosuppressive-drug related side effect lead complication life threaten infection , malignancy , high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes . Additionally , certain drug use prevent organ rejection know contribute renal damage , lead many patient experience graft loss within 15 year . To end , many child undergo successful kidney transplantation require re-transplantation adult . Therefore , transplantation yield high success rate short-term , drug responsible early temporary success also cause later , serious complication . This especially true child , endure extend drug exposure . The purpose study explore impact viral exposure child receive immunosuppressive medication renal transplantation ; study cellular change associate influence ; monitor medication adherence ; observe factor affect outcome kidney transplantation child . The hope well understand process optimize future transplant therapy pediatric transplant recipient . This study design observe immune system response first year kidney transplant . Cells immune system recipient 's blood , urine , transplant kidney test observe drug use prevent rejection influence , cell change time , related kidney rejection . The comparison allow researcher study develop immune system interact kidney transplant . Blood kidney donor request researcher study recipient 's immune system interacts donor cell . This study also look closely well participant take prescribed medication . Since transplant medication know change immune system , test immune system cell compare test design measure accurately medication take . Medication adherence measure use electronic medication bottle cap record , paper survey result , drug level blood . In way , study team hop learn impact child 's medication immune system . This study take place multiple transplant center United States . It observational involve approximately 75 pediatric renal participant . The study last total 3 year , include 2 year accrual period 12 month follow . Clinical treatment determine standard care participate center . There Baseline assessment occur day transplantation follow-up study visit take place month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 transplant . Study assessment specimens also collected time clinically indicate biopsy . Study assessments follow-up visit include vital sign ; review current medication ; question related adverse event ( infection , rejection , graft failure , malignancy ) ; treatment adherence survey ; specimen collection local central laboratory testing .</detailed_description>
