	<brief_summary>An increase longevity number men woman old 60 year old observe industrialized country . Aging complex , multifactorial continuous process involve physical biological modification notably decrease glucose tolerance type 2 diabetes risk . Insulin sensitivity follow-up age difficult mainly many confound factor ( environment , lifestyle ) . In 2006 , SUVIMAX 2 study begin , base monitoring volunteer participate former SUVIMAX study ( 1994-2003 ) . This study randomise trial design study link low antioxidant intake risk cancer ischemic heart disease . The subject recently health check-up include complete information diet , physical neurosensory status . Based data , score establish classify subject accord quality aging ( `` successful age versus `` problematic aging '' ) These volunteer , undertook 13-year follow-up ( dietary medical status ) , constitute reference population determine mechanism involve insulin resistance development age . The purpose research work determine whether quality age could influence insulin sensitivity , study metabolic profile change gene expression ( gene involve glucose metabolism metabolic senescence muscle tissue ) aging .</brief_summary>
