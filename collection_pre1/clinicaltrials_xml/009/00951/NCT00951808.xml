	<brief_summary>Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) similar severe pneumonia common cause hospitalization people sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . Blood transfusion one treatment option ACS . High level enzyme call secretory phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2 ) may present people develop ACS . This study determine well sPLA2 level predict onset ACS whether identify high sPLA2 level allow enough time prevent ACS blood transfusion . Results study help determine feasibility conduct large study would examine use sPLA2 level blood transfusion prevent ACS people SCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Acute Chest Syndrome Transfusion Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder , symptom include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , call `` sickle cell crisis . '' ACS , characterize fever , respiratory distress , lung tissue damage , second common cause hospitalization lead cause death among people SCD . Most people SCD experience least one episode ACS , repeat episode result progressive lung disease . ACS appear suddenly often require immediate hospitalization treatment , include blood transfusion . People elevate blood level sPLA2 may risk develop ACS , enzyme often detectable onset ACS symptom . The purpose study examine use sPLA2 predictor ACS determine whether subsequent blood transfusion administer early enough prevent onset ACS people SCD risk ACS . Study researcher also assess feasibility conducting large study would examine effectiveness use sPLA2 level blood transfusion prevent ACS . This study involve two part . In first part study , participant SCD admit hospital acute sickle cell pain event randomly assign receive either single blood transfusion standard care ACS blood transfusion . All participant closely monitor hospital development ACS , study researcher review participant ' medical record . All participant undergo daily blood collection , include test sPLA2 level , least two chest x-ray . Twenty-eight day hospital discharge , participant attend follow-up study visit blood collection , determine sPLA2 level . In second part study , participant eligible choose participate first part study enrol observational group . These participant receive standard care ACS , receive blood transfusion . They undergo daily blood collection hospital stay least one chest x-ray . While participant hospital 28 day discharge , study researcher review participant ' medical record .</detailed_description>
