However , report also emphasize concern comprehensive long-term data U.S. live donor outcome insufficient . One concern current data may underestimate true long-term morbidity mortality live kidney donation . Additionally , old study might apply current donor population include old obese individual . This observational study look long term outcome live kidney donor . This study also seek find living kidney donor high risk certain condition compare people similar background donate kidney . Medical history , complete questionnaire , blood urine test collect donor non donor . The compile data donor non donor compare . Risks diseases related kidney , heart , blood vessel examine two group . Quality life health insurance status also compare . The study conduct 2 phase . All donor donate kidney 5 50 year ago one three study transplant center ask take part Phase 1 . Phase 1 aim collect limited medical information use short questionnaire . Phase 2 include Phase 1 donor agree assessment match community control participant . Participants Phase 2 ask complete in-depth questionnaire health status quality life . Phase 2 also involve height , weight , blood pressure measurement . Blood urine collect study participant necessary test within 3 year study participation . Seven thousand-eight hundred-sixty four ( 7864 ) previous kidney donor two thousand-five hundred ( 2500 ) control subject ask take part study . Participants recruit study 2.5 .</detailed_description>
