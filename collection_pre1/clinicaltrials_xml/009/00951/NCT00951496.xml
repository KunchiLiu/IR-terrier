	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Intravenous Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II-III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine one propose intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) event rate compare standard intravenous chemotherapy first-line treatment patient diagnose advanced stage ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . II . If intraperitoneal ( IP ) regimens significantly improve PFS event rate compare standard regimen , second study objective determine whether IP cisplatin intravenous ( IV ) paclitaxel day one plus IP paclitaxel day eight improves PFS event rate compare IP carboplatin IV paclitaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine intraperitoneal chemotherapy reduces overall death rate compare standard intravenous chemotherapy . II . To assess frequency severity adverse event define Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 . III . To compare patient-reported outcome : Quality Life ( Function Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian-Trial Outcome Index [ FACT-O-TOI ] ) , Neuropathy ( FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group/Neurotoxicity [ GOG/NTX4 ] scale ) , Abdominal discomfort ( FACT-GOG/AD scale ) , Fatigue ( FACIT-Fatigue scale ) , Nausea ( item FACT-O-TOI ) . IV . To assess frequency reason early discontinuation study treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) whole blood research examine association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) measure clinical outcome include overall survival , progression-free survival adverse event . II . To bank archival tumor research examine association tumor marker measure clinical outcome include overall survival , progression-free survival adverse event . III . Patients encourage enroll companion translational research protocol ( CEM0703 development ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 course 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab alone course 7-22 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel Arm I carboplatin IP day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab Arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab alone Arm I . ARM III : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 , cisplatin IP day 2 , paclitaxel IP day 8 . Patients also receive bevacizumab Arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab alone Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
