	<brief_summary>This study do see addition mangosteen juice standard medical care reduce risk atrial fibrillation ( AF ) recurrence follow direct current ( DC ) cardioversion . The study also look effect mangosteen juice may biomarkers inflammation endothelial cell dysfunction ( tissue line artery function properly ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Use Mangosteen Juice Added Usual Care Reducing Risk Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mangosteen Effects Inflammatory Markers Atrial Fibrillation Trial study design test primary hypothesis dietary supplement ( Mangosteen ) contain anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property may effect measure level inflammatory biomarkers . Secondarily , study compare attenuation marker endothelial cell dysfunction include endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , clinical level anticoagulation ( INR ) , digoxin , lipid , glycosylated hemoglobin ( Hgb A1c ) , quality life measurement , AF recurrence , associate level inflammatory marker experience recurrent AF mangosteen group placebo group . This trial randomize 250 patient present Mayo Clinic Cardioversion Unit one year two group include mangosteen supplement group versus control group placebo juice . Patients enrol history paroxysmal , persistent , longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation exclude history recent surgery , myocardial infarction , infection , collagen vascular disease active inflammation , thyroid disease . Furthermore , patient already corticosteroid exclude . Patients evaluate enrollment follow 3 month 6 month repeat ECG , laboratory test inflammatory biomarkers endothelial function , well quality life question . The trial track effect natural juice contain anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property inflammatory marker , endothelial progenitor cell , quality life . This trial attempt determine dietary supplement effect inflammatory marker correlate rate recurrent AF two group .</detailed_description>
