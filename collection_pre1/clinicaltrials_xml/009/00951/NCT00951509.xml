	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine whether computer base virtual reality base drive assessment useful real-world power wheelchair drive test measure drive performance whether may useful help identify problem individual may drive power wheelchair . The specific aim follow : Specific Aim 1 : To develop computer-based VR-based wheelchair drive assessment driver non-drivers correspond accept real-world driving assessment ( Power Mobility Road Test ) compare real-world assessment . Specific Aim 2 : To develop additional feature computer-based VR-based assessment present dynamic task determine whether skill task delineate within virtual environment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study experimental , repeated measure design validity reliability test . In Phase 1 study , design develop software need deliver computer-based VR-based testing environment . In Phase 2 study , improve design iteration Phase I , recruit sample 31 Electric Power wheelchair ( EPW ) user deliver simulator base drive assessment use pool clinician assess reliability system real world virtual environment . Phase II : Research Protocol : Experimental Set-up : VRSIM consist two display option , three 6 ' X 8 ' back project screen ( field view 160° ) ( VR screen ) single 22 '' desktop monitor ( field view 90° ) ( PC screen ) , first-person perspective viewpoint ( Fig.1 ) . The virtual environment consist simulation indoor office space kitchen ; lounge area set hallway line office , incorporate task PMRT ( Fig.2 ) . Participants interact VRSIM either use dual roller interfaced drive wheel wheelchair ( 'Rollers ON ' drive mode ) use instrument wheelchair joystick custom software ( 'Rollers OFF ' drive mode ) . The custom software use proportional derivative mathematical model simulate real-world motion EPW within virtual environment . VRSIM design two display option two user input modality assess feasibility use system different interface different setting , busy wheelchair clinic ( use much immersive VR screen roller ) user 's home ( user 's personal computer customize joystick ) . The `` actor/driver '' VRSIM virtual model person sit standard commercially available EPW power wheelchair ( width 0.671 , length 0.701 ) . A horizontal slider bar indicate real time location virtual wheelchair respect virtual obstacle add version ( Fig.1 , 2 ) . This help display warning chair close obstacle , especially obstacles behind driver . Participants expect drive along course indicated arrows touch pass preset milestone marker signify semi-transparent balloon . These sequentially display milestone define task virtual PMRT . Participants instruct complete every task quickly accurately possible . An equivalent PMRT drive course chart office space real world drive evaluation . Data collection : After informed consent , participant perform 2 practice session within virtual driving course . Participants report level comfort sense control VRSIM practice base value 1.0 4.0 select linear angular speed gain VRSIM . In addition , participant ask select different pre-programmed driving profile wheelchair ( e.g . `` indoor '' profile ) , similar everyday driving profile obtain optimum drive speed . Optional break 5-10 minute provide driving session . For PC VR screen , participant drive complete drive course : two trial Rollers ON drive mode , one trial Rollers OFF drive mode , one trial real-world PMRT drive course constitute total 5 driving condition ( Table 1 ) . A balanced randomization scheme use set order five driving condition . From group 6 clinician comprise 1 occupational therapist , 3 physical therapist , 2 physician , 2 clinician randomly assign evaluation team participant . The team always 1 certified Assistive Technology Professional 5 year experience power wheelchair drive evaluation . The assigned clinician independently score every PMRT task drive trial use follow criterion : 4 : complete independently , 3 : complete hesitantly require several trial minor accident , 2 : commits serious accident may cause harm driver people , 1 : unable complete task . Each clinician separate PMRT score sheet trial . Repeat Testing : Subjects underwent five test scenario twice , return second visit earlier 2 week .</detailed_description>
