Cocaine addiction characterize compulsive drug use despite adverse consequence high rate relapse period abstinence . Cocaine addiction may mediate neuroadaptations reward-related learning memory process mesocorticolimbic dopamine system glutamatergic corticolimbic circuitry .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Cocaine dependent participant must meet DSMIV criterion cocaine dependence time participation . Control participants provide appropriate match cocainedependent participant recruit follow characteristic : age , possible , parental socioeconomic status and/or year parental education . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Control Participants : 1 . Psychiatric disease : DSMIV criterion use ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) . No subject current axis I diagnosis ( except nicotine dependence ) allow . Claustrophobia also exclusionary . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Volunteers report current significant history illicit drug abuse exclude study . Subjects may use moderate amount alcohol caffeine smoke occasional marijuana cigarette , must dependent alcohol , caffeine marijuana . No alcohol marijuana least 24 hour prior scan . No smoking midnight night scan . 3 . Current Past Medication Use : Volunteers may currently use chronic ( daily 10 14 day last month ) prescription counter medication , ( include , limited , antihypertensive , antiallergy , pain ) . Over counter prescription medication may use occasional basis ( treatment selflimited condition , occasional headache , musculoskeletal discomfort , allergic symptom pain ) . All medication discontinue least 5 day experimental session . 4 . CNS disease : History know structural brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasm , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , history head trauma ( define document loss consciousness &gt; 5 min ) , history seizure adult , sleep apnea , tic disorder . 5 . Cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic disease : Repeated ( measure three separate occasion ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg , systolic blood pressure &gt; 135 mm Hg , know arrhythmia , symptomatic know coronary artery disease ; history endocarditis , cerebral embolism , obstructive pulmonary disease , Factive tuberculosis , know endocrine disease ( derangement adrenal , thyroid , bone reproductive function ) , know chronic renal hepatic dysfunction , HIV seropositive , know current autoimmune disease involve CNS . 6 . Miscellaneous exclusionary criterion : Body weight great 300 lb . Hematocrit &lt; 39.0 male &lt; 36.0 female . Participants also exclude vein inaccessible . 7 . Radiation exposure : Any subject participate research study he/she receive radiation exposure would result combination present study , total effective radiation exposure ( research study ) exceed 5.0 rem year . 8 . Novocain allergy lack bilateral ulner radial arterial patency subject receive arterial catheter assess Allen test Dopler test artery patency subject catheterize . 9 . Presence body metallic implant material could move magnet MRI scanner : pacemaker , surgical implant , aneurism clip , dental brace , bullet ( ) metallic material . A history work metal consequent possible metal fragment body . 10 . Inability lie flat hour PET scan 11 . Women pregnant lactate child age 18 exclude avoid unnecessary exposure radiation population . Cocaine Dependent Subjects : In addition exclusion criterion list exception item i. b ) , subject group exclude : 1 . They actively seek engage substance abuse treatment . Justification : Videos view study may produce drug craving , produce significant risk relapse dependent individual attempt remain abstinent . Any participant seek treatment refer treatment , since delay entry treatment participate study unnecessarily increase exposure risk associate active cocaine dependence . Assessment tool ( ) : Clinical interview screen repeat question time consent . 2 . They dependent substance except nicotine cocaine time participation . Use abuse substance allow long currently dependent drug except nicotine cocaine . Justification : Dependence substance may result unique CNS deficit would increase noise data . Further , dependence may contaminate neural process examine . Nicotine dependence allow since nicotine use associate drug high normal usage prevalence nicotine dependence cocaine use individual may make impractical exclude . Assessment tool ( ) : Substance Use Disorders module SCID confirmation clinical interview negative urine drug screen . Positive screen cocaine allow .</criteria>
