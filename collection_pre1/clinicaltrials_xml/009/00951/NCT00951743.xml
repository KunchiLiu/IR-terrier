	<brief_summary>This 24 week placebo control , double-blind , 2-arm study ADAPTAVIR , Monomeric Dala1-peptide T-amide ( mDAPTA ) compare placebo , HIV infect individual suppress plasma viral load &lt; 200 copies/ml highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) treatment least 3 month prior entry least 6 continuous month HAART treatment precede entry . 20 treatment 20 placebo individual enrol arm . The study duration 24 week placebo mDAPTA administer intranasally 0.01 mg two time day . The main ( intent treat ) analysis plan 24 week endpoint . The virological outcome interest present study infectious virus recoverable cellular ( PBMC ) source cellular viral mRNA DNA copy number . Immune outcome ( plasma cytokine ) associate HIV disease , HIV replication , immune function study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A primary objective study assess safety toxicity mDAPTA ( Adaptavir ) HIV infected individual suppress viral load HAART treatment ass proportion study participant achieve PMBC viral culture negative status 24weeks . PMBC viral culture status direct measurement treatment resistant , residual , active HIV replication peripheral blood mononuclear cell . We hypothesize proportion significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm ( odds achieve endpoint significantly great mDAPTA- placebo-treated participant ) . Secondary Endpoints ( analyze odds ratio ) determine - The proportion study participant achieve ( 0.5 log10 ) decrease quantitative viral mRNA PBMCs significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm . - The proportion study participant achieve ( 0.5 log10 ) decrease quantitative viral DNA PBMCs significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm . - The proportion study participant whose plasma viral load great 200 copies/ml two successive measurement 6 week apart significantly great placebo arm relative treatment arm . Immunological outcome hypothesis , base 24-week data - The proportion study participant achieve least great 50 % decrease inflammatory cytokine TNFa , IL-10 , IL-8 IL-6 significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm . - The proportion study participant achieve least great 50 % increase cytokines IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-12 , IL-13 IFNa significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm . - The proportion study participant achieve least increase CD4 T cell significantly great treatment arm relative placebo arm . - The proportion study participant whose viral load become great 200 copies/ml significantly great placebo arm relative treatment arm .</detailed_description>
