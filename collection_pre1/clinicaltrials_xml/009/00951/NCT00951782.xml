	<brief_summary>Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) currently evaluate treatment option major depression . It show safe procedure . Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation coil design maximize electrical field deep brain summation separate field project skull several point around periphery . The device plan minimize accumulation electrical charge surface brain . Such accumulation give rise electrostatic field might reduce magnitude induced electric field surface inside , thus reduce depth penetration induce electric field . Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation could effective repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation due deep penetration brain tissue . The deep penetration produce great action nerve fiber connect prefrontal cortex limbic system . The ability high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) alter dopaminergic neurotransmission subcortical structure could explain recent report , suggest potential reduce smoke nicotine craving . Ecihhammer et al demonstrated reduction number cigarette smoke desire smoke single rTMS treatment ( Eichhammer et al. , 2003 ) . In addition , Johan et al cross-over , double-blind , placebo-controlled study demonstrate reduction cigarette consumption desire smoke single repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment ( Johann et al. , 2003 ) . Recently , investigator finish complete study nicotine addiction use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 10 consecutive day . They find 10 day rTMS reduce significantly well placebo number cigarette smoke , nicotine dependence craving ( Amiaz et al 2007 , preparation ) . Interestingly , effect strong sub-group patient present smoking-related picture immediately prior stimulation onset . Although , result interest exciting , two important caveat . First , 50 % -60 % smoker respond repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment . Second , among responded treatment , 10 % quit totally smoke . Therefore , potential therapeutic benefit treatment limit . The investigator ' hypothesis deep transcranial magnetic stimulation may efficient smoke cessation due 's deep penetration therefore 's capability stimulate deeper fiber dopamine-reward-activating system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan I . PARTICIPANTS Male female cigarette smoker suffer COPD . From general population age 21-70 wish quit smoke fail respond previous anti-smoking treatment . They recruit advertisement newspaper specific website . The number participant sub-group ( describe table ) 15-17 . The investigator recruit 90-102 subject two year . II . SCREENING PROCEDURE Before stimulation procedure onset , participant undergo clinical interview . All subject candidate give write informed consent take part study . Thereafter , test baseline pretreatment level nicotine addiction screen meeting . This include report level consumption ( number cigarette smoke per day overall duration year ) visual analog scale ( VAS , see detail ) . In addition , urine sample cotinine level ( nicotine metabolite ) obtain order objectively measure level nicotine . In addition , several self-administered questionnaire give subject order measure baseline crave nicotine dependence : 1 . Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) ( Heatherton et al. , 1991 ) . ( Appendix no.1a ) 2 . Tobacco Craving Questionnaire ( TCQ ) ( Heishman et al. , 2003 ) . ( Appendix no.1b ) 3 . Full demographic questionnaire medical condition smoking habit . ( Appendix no.1c ) III . MEASURES All subject undergo various measurement several visit , describe table 1-3 , nicotine consumption , crave dependence rTMS treatment visit : 1 . VAS : Visual Analogue Scale , subject mark his/her subjective crave 10-cm-long scale response follow question : `` How much crave joint/bong right ? '' This `` desire smoke rating '' show sensitive assess self-reported level crave nicotine smoking ( Schuh Stitzer , 1995 ; King Meyer , 2000 ) . 2 . Short TCQ : Tobacco Craving Questionnaire , short version TCQ , 12 question divide four category : emotionality , expectancy , compulsivity purposefulness . 3 . FTND : Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence . Measures level nicotine dependence ( Dijkstra Tromp , 2002 ) . 4 . Self-report number cigarette smoke previous day . 5 . Urine sample . 6 . BR : desire smoke effect hunger . 7 . Spatial span memory test - order evaluate effect deep rTMS spatial memory . This test conduct screen interview 10 day rTMS treatment . IV . PRESENTATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS It recently demonstrate nicotine-deprived smoker , reward attention circuit reactivate mere exposure smoking-related image , contrast neutral image ( Due et al. , 2002 ) . In experiment , prior stimulation onset 14 'neutral ' 'nicotine-related ' color photograph present computer screen participant seat . The 'nicotine-related ' photograph compose smoking-related scene , light cigarette , smoke puff etc . 'Neutral ' photo consist matched picture without nicotine relate content ( e.g . inanimate object , hand , face etc. ) . As investigator previously show figure-8 coil experiment , strong effect rTMS treatment subject expose nicotine photograph . The investigator propose presentation nicotine photograph cause nicotine-related memory become activated therefore , labile interference , previously show ( Dudai , 2004 ) . V. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES After screen participant take account inclusion exclusion criterion ( describe ) , divide experimental group similar level nicotine addiction demographic background . At selected time afterwards , participant introduce TMS treatment protocol . They ask refrain smoke nicotine two hour prior attend daily treatment session . Prior stimulation onset , participant present 'nicotine ' photograph . Immediately offset photograph presentation ( memory reactivate ) participant apply real sham rTMS stimulation . The stimulation site PFC use H-ADD coil . Time Table : There daily treatment two week accompany assessment level nicotine addiction select day use above-mentioned tool . Thereafter , subject continue maintenance rTMS/sham stimulation treatment : 3 time week one week , two time week forth fifth week , week sixth seventh week ( see also table 2 ) . After maintenance , participant continue follow visit occur month six month ( see table 3 ) . This protocol allow evaluation short long-term effect rTMS treatment possible fluctuation time . TMS procedure : The investigator use Magstim Super Rapid stimulator , produce biphasic pulse , special customized equipment coil deep brain stimulation ( Zangen , 2005 ) . The TMS coil , use study specific version H-coil , depend region stimulation . The H-coil version use study , H-ADD coil , test healthy volunteer find safe induce short-lasting ( 1 hour ) cognitive alteration ( Levkovitz et al. , 2007 , accept ) . The theoretical consideration design principles H-coils explain previous study ( Roth , 2002 ) . In short , H-ADD coil design generate summation electric field specific brain region locate coil element different location around region , common current component induce electric field desire direction .In addition , since radial component dramatic effect electric field magnitude rate decay electric field distance , overall length coil element nontangential skull minimize , element well coil element current component opposite direction locate distant possible brain region activate . The H-ADD coil place scalp leave motor cortex . The center coil place scalp handle point backward laterally 45° angle away midline . Thus current induced neural tissue direct approximately perpendicular line central sulcus therefore optimal activate corticospinal pathway transsynaptically ( Kaneko et al. , 1996 ) . With slightly suprathreshold stimulus intensity , stimulate H-ADD coil move left hemisphere determine optimal position elicit MEPs maximal amplitude ( 'hot spot ' ) . The optimal position coil mark relative 'hot spot ' ensure coil placement throughout experiment . Resting motor threshold determine near 1 % maximum stimulator output define minimal stimulus intensity require produce MEPs &gt; 50 µV ≥5 10 consecutive trial least 5 sec apart . The H-ADD coil hold stable coil holder , adjust different point relative 'hot spot ' scalp . Stimulation Protocols : The investigator use either sham real H-ADD coil , produce similar noise share similar shape ( investigator use study healthy volunteer ) . Stimulation intensity 120 % relative motor threshold 'hot spot ' . PFC location determine follow : 6 cm anterior motor 'hot spot ' symmetric . High frequency stimulation apply order achieve activation stimulate brain area possibly induce LTP like plasticity . The stimulation protocol 33 train 10 Hz 3 second , ITI 20 second . The total treatment duration 759 second 990 pulse . . For purpose investigator design special cooling system coil use successfully healthy volunteer study ( Levkovitz et al. , 2007 , accept ) .</detailed_description>
