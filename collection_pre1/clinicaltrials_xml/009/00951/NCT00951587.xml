	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( PCCE ) Night Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evaluation subject suspect colonic disease include endoscopic image colonoscopy radiologic image air-contrast barium enema , CT colonography . The Given® Diagnostic System offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon use capsule endoscopy , ingestible device contain imagers , light source , power source RF transmitter . Advantages Given® Diagnostic System include elimination need sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , Given® Diagnostic System may readily accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo diagnostic evaluation colon comply colorectal cancer screen recommendation . The PillCam™ SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) FDA-approved August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 500,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well processional society . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam™ SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam™ SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam™ SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . This expect improve capability Given® Diagnostic System detect colonic pathology serve diagnostic screening tool colonic disease . Further detail PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscope ( PCCE ) find device description section . This pilot study design evaluate level cleanliness visualization colon achieve colon capsule endoscopy use Night procedure regimens preparation colon .</detailed_description>
