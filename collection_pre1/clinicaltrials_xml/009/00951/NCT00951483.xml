	<detailed_description>The evidence depressive anxiety disorder confer high relative risk ( RR ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) development clear compelling . A cadre inflammation , platelet activation biomarkers endothelial dysfunction strongly suggest multiple possibly interrelate mechanism underlie co-morbidity . Early detection vulnerability develop CVD become urgent health issue . However , detection alone vulnerability without proper therapeutic intervention aim reversing , merely scientific interest . The evidence date antidepressant drug , highly efficacious restore euthymia , may normalize biomarkers CVD vulnerability . Hence , need identify pharmacologic intervention depression . Quetiapine , due unique molecular structure unique pharmacological profile , belong none know class antidepressant . However , quetiapine clearly antidepressant anti-anxiety efficacy . Now , propose explore whether quetiapine reverse pathophysiological change occur mixed depression/anxiety link causally development CVD . Accordingly , primary purpose study compare C-Reactive Protein treatment healthy control group 12 week post treatment .</detailed_description>
