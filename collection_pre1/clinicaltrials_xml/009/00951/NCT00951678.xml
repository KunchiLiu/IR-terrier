	<brief_summary>Central venous catheterization common important procedure do emergency department . The internal jugular vein ( IJV ) , subclavian vein ( SV ) femoral vein ( FV ) commonly used central venous access . Unfortunately , procedure high-risk complication . Traditionally , physician rely use anatomic landmark physical manipulation move head rotate leg order place central catheter ; however , study demonstrate significant anatomic variation exist within large percentage study population . In addition , although study demonstrate use ultrasonography placement femoral catheter lead low rate complication , previous study specifically determine anatomic variation femoral triangle . Therefore , study examine anatomic variation IJV vs. carotid artery femoral vein vs. femoral artery emergency room setting . The investigator study variation function sex , age , race , body habitus degree head rotation ( measure use goniometer ) , investigator demonstrate utility use ultrasound place central line order decrease morbidity .</brief_summary>
