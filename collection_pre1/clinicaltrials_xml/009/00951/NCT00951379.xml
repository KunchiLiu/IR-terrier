	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Oral Premalignant Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical histologic response oral premalignant lesion 24 week therapy pioglitazone , 45 mg daily ( qd ) , define 50 % great reduction sum measure product perpendicular dimension target lesion , improvement degree dysplasia hyperplasia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine degree change putative biomarkers pioglitazone efficacy include ( restrict ) order priority , tissue level : - PPAR gamma , - cyclin D1 p21 indirect measure pharmacological effect - TUNEL apoptosis Ki-67 proliferation - transglutaminase involucrin marker squamous differentiation - 15-PGDH , loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) . II . To determine degree change C-reactive protein ( CRP ) plasma . III . To assess tobacco alcohol use among trial participant examine relationship tobacco alcohol use treatment response . IV . To assess safety agent population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 24 week . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 24 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STAGE I : Males female suspect histologically confirm oral premalignant lesion ( ) ( three target lesion may follow purpose study ) length ( long diameter ) 8 mm great width ( diameter perpendicular great length ) 3 mm great size If participant biopsy target oral premalignant lesion ( OPL ) lesion ( ) within 6 week prior screen visit archival tissue available participant agree archival tissue use histologic confirmation biomarker analysis , NO additional biopsy ( OPL ) need perform screening visit ; prescreening biopsy must undergo centralized pathology review second stage registration perform ; archival tissue available , wait period 6 week time last biopsy must observe rebiopsy study purpose If participant biopsy suspect OPL time screen visit , biopsy lesion must perform screen visit ; screen biopsy must undergo centralized pathology review second stage registration perform The participant 's life expectancy &gt; 6 month The participant discontinue oral cancer chemopreventive therapy least 12 week prior baseline visit toxicity fully resolve ; daily aspirin permit The participant willing able fully participate duration study Women must pregnant lactating ; woman childbearing potential ( woman consider childbearing potential least two year postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile ) must use adequate contraception ( abstinence ; barrier method IUD , diaphragm spermicidal gel , condom , others ; hormonal method birth control pills others ) since last menses prior study entry ; woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception duration study participation ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform study physician immediately Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document STAGE II : The participant one target lesion histologically confirm biopsy obtain 9 week prior randomization , either : An EARLY premalignant lesion define high risk : Mild dysplasia site Hyperplastic leukoplakia highrisk site Dorsal , lateral ventral tongue Floor mouth An ADVANCED premalignant lesion define presence least one following : Moderate dysplasia Severe dysplasia ( exclude carcinoma situ ) Erythroplakia ( due high risk progression associate erythroplakia , erythroplakia histology define ADVANCED oral premalignant lesion ) Hemoglobin level equal low limit normal White blood cell &gt; = 3,000/uL Platelets &gt; = 125,000/uL Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 * upper limit normal ( ULN ) BUN serum creatinine = &lt; 1.5 * ULN Glucose , serum &lt; 200 mg/dL The participant 's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 If participant female childbearing potential lactating document negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior randomization The participant baseline EKG show sign acute cardiac ischemia cardiac dysrhythmia ( except 1st degree AV block chronic atrial fibrillation ) ; EKG earlier report within 12 week prior registration Participants use drug list may randomize unless willing stop medication ( possibly change alternative nonexcluded medication treat condition ) less 3 day prior start pioglitazone placebo study ; use follow drug drug class prohibit pioglitazone/placebo treatment : participant take inhibitor CYP2C8 ( gemfibrozil , ketoconazole , quercetin , trimethoprim ) , enzyme inducer CYP2C8 ( cortisol , dexamethasone , phenobarbital , rifampin ) , CYP3A4 substrate The participant active cancer carcinoma situ head neck The participant contraindication biopsy The participant presence congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IIIV ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 150 diastolic &gt; 100 ) , unstable angina The participant history congestive heart failure history myocardial infarction within past 6 month The participant exhibit clinical evidence active liver disease history chronic liver disease The participant &gt; Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 1 edema The participant know diabetes insulin oral agent ; participant receive medical therapy dysregulated blood sugar The participant currently receive enzyme inhibitor CYP2C8 ( gemfibrozil , ketoconazole , quercetin , trimethoprim ) , enzyme inducer CYP2C8 ( cortisol , dexamethasone , phenobarbital , rifampin ) , CYP3A4 substrate eligible randomization assess eligibility stage two unless he/she eligible randomization assess eligibility stage two unless he/she willing stop drug possibly replace alternative therapy The participant currently receive pregabalin thioridazine The participant experience jaundice Rezulin ( troglitazone ) The participant history colorectal cancer , familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) The participant history bladder cancer situ bladder cancer The participant history invasive cancer within past 18 month ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer ) ; participant ( exclude history colorectal cancer , FAP , HNPCC , bladder cancer situ bladder cancer ) receive curative treatment show evidence recurrence 18 month eligible</criteria>
