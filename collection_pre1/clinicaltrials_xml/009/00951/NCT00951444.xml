	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , MK-0646 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin effective give together without MK-0646 treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin work give together without MK-0646 first-line therapy treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Carboplatin With Without MK-0646 First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess compare progression-free survival patient stage IIIB IV squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin v without MK-0646 first-line therapy . Secondary - To assess compare objective tumor response rate patient treat regimen . - To assess compare duration response patient objective tumor response treat regimen . - To assess compare time progression time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - To assess compare 1-year overall survival patient treat regimen . - To assess compare clinical toxicity regimens patient . - To compare quality life patient treat regimen . Tertiary - To collect blood tumor specimens future evaluation pharmacogenetic proteomic marker tumor response toxicity therapy . - To assess relationship ht-SNPs gene mediate chemosensitivity/resistance gemcitabine hydrochloride ( e.g . ribonucleotide reductase ) IGF1R pathway gene . - To bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides future histochemistry evaluation DNA extraction part ongoing research NCCTG lung study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior adjuvant therapy , neoadjuvant therapy , chemoradiotherapy ( yes v ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , MK-0646 IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 4 course , patient stable disease partial complete response may receive MK-0646 alone day 1 15 . Treatment MK-0646 repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may crossover arm I upon disease progression . Blood tissue sample may collect pharmacogenetics laboratory analysis . Quality life assess baseline periodically study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
