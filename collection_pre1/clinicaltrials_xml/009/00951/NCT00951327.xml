	<brief_summary>Patients primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) affect inflammatory condition bile duct . Unfortunately , patient PSC 10 15 percent lifetime risk develop gallbladder bile duct cancer . Gallbladder bile duct cancer five-year survival 5 10 percent . Surgery provide cure must remove cancer confine one area . In order increase survival rate need identify cancer pre-cancer early . This difficult . Patients lab test , positive imaging test obstruction usually test call ERCP ( Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram ) take biopsy enlarge bile duct open bile duct stent . Patients usually cell bile duct remove analyzed , study show sensitive may determine cell cancer pre-cancerous . A new scope system use light filter call Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) may help detect cancer pre-cancer often earlier stage .</brief_summary>
