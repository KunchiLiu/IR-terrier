	<brief_summary>It traditionally consider someone positive tuberculin skin test ( TST ) ( and/or positive result Cell Interferon-Gamma Release Assay ( TIGRA ) , depend different country ' guideline ) infect ill absence lesion demonstrate thorax X-Ray assay . Even though , experience describe literature use cow pig animal model study LTBI demonstrate presence kind lesion animal , even small detect X-Ray assay , would suggest also could happen human LTBI . Nowadays , High Resolution Scanners ( HR TC ) offer possibility detect lesion approximately 1 mm diameter , investigator plan use technique screen people already infect M. tuberculosis ( ill , follow Diagnosis Standard Guidelines ) . Additional pathological analysis resect post-mortem tissue provide lesion-based profile human infected tuberculosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Latent Tuberculosis Infection ( LTBI ) High Resolution Scanner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It traditionally consider development LTBI due M. tuberculosis ability develop dormancy state within well-structured lesion ( granuloma ) , remain lung host even life . The investigator develop new original hypothesis base scientific evidence take account idea lesion hold forever , host tends remove lesion order rebuild original parenchyma , heal process . Even M. tuberculosis remain dormant/non-replicating state long period , important sufficient factor explain LTBI . The Dynamic Hypothesis try explain existence LTBI spite heal process could remove constant reinfection host 's tissue .</detailed_description>
