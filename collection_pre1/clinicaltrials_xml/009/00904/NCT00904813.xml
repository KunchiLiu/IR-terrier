	<brief_summary>There theoretical reason believe radiotherapy ( RT ) give large fraction shorter period time might result late side effect give conventional , protracted RT patient rectal cancer . In addition , optimum timing surgery RT , respect postoperative morbidity , mortality potential downsizing tumour know . To address question , prospective randomize multicentre trial initiate , Stockholm III trial , patient primarily resectable rectal cancer randomize short-course preoperative RT ( 5x5 Gy ) follow surgery within one week 4-8 week long-course preoperative RT ( 25x2 Gy ) follow surgery 4-8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preoperative radiotherapy ( RT ) recommend many patient localised rectal cancer , previously treat pelvic RT . However , optimum fractionation , time surgery best use concomitant chemotherapy remain controversial . Short-course , preoperative RT may induce acute late morbidity claim cause morbidity long-course preoperative RT . There theoretical reason believe RT give large fraction shorter period time might result late side effect give conventional , protracted RT . In addition , optimum timing surgery RT , respect postoperative morbidity , mortality potential downsizing tumour know .</detailed_description>
