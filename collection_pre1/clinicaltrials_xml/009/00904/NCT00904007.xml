	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veterans ' Healthcare : This study aim demonstrate online interactive space education ( ISE ) improve provider ' care patient hypertension . ISE type intervention deploy across VHA content tailor meet specific need implemented tool improve performance measure clinical outcome . Project Background/Rationale : ISE novel educational methodology base `` spacing effect '' , psychological finding repeat presentation educational material space interval increase learn efficiency improve knowledge retention . ISE deliver use periodic email contain clinical case scenario multiple-choice question . We recently complete randomized trial involve 95 VISN 1 primary care provider ( PCPs ) demonstrate ISE intervention significantly improve clinician 's practice pattern . Those clinician randomize ISE intervention prostate cancer screen demonstrate 26 % relative reduction inappropriate screening . Project Objectives : Lowering blood pressure hypertensive patient unequivocally decrease incidence stroke cardiovascular event highly cost-effective . The majority patient blood pressure treatment target anti-hypertensive medication appropriately intensified clinician visit . A reduced frequency treatment intensification alternatively term 'clinical inertia ' . Our preliminary result show clinician ' knowledge hypertension management guideline limit , clinician report follow guideline consistently . We propose conduct randomize controlled trial involve PCPs VISN 1 determine whether ISE ( 1 ) increase knowledge appropriate treatment hypertensive patient , ( 2 ) reduce clinical inertia hypertension management , ( 3 ) improve blood pressure control hypertensive patient . Project Methods : One hundred six VISN 1 primary care practitioner ( physician , nurse practitioner , physician assistant ) recruit via email participate study . Participants randomize one two cohort : ( 1 ) intervention cohort receive ISE year 1 , ( 2 ) control cohort receive intervention represent `` standard education '' hypertension management . The ISE intervention consist email every 4 day contain 1 multiple-choice question base curriculum derive clinical practice guideline appropriate hypertension management . Providers submit answer question online immediately receive correct answer explanation pertinent clinical issue . Using new adaptive methodology , space content educational intervention individualize clinician base performance . The ISE intervention complete 9-11 month . Hypertension knowledge assess post-test end year 1 . Providers ' clinical inertia blood pressure patient assess 2 year : initial change attributable ISE identify year 1 , retention change monitor year 2 . Drawing interdisciplinary expertise investigator team , study position enrich national debate best improve way clinician meet lifelong learn need .</detailed_description>
