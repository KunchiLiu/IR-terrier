	<brief_summary>This study two aim : Aim 1 : To determine presence accumulation fat within cell functional consequence kidney correlate kidney fat content urine test result . Aim 2 : The investigator evaluate effect thiazolidinedione ( pioglitazone ) excess fatty acid accumulation kidney tissue correlation uric acid stone formation subject uric acid stone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study use combination cell culture , animal , human study employ late technology magnetic resonance spectroscopy single-photon emission compute tomography , combine classical physiology , biochemistry , molecular biology test four interrelated hypothesis . There increased uptake free fatty acid kidney result higher circulating level well preferential transport proximal tubule part `` conditioning '' effect . The increased provision free fatty acid supply metabolic substrate ATP generation hence reduce consumption substrate glutamine , principal source ammoniagenesis proximal tubule . This substrate competition , metabolic switch , low formation major urinary buffer ammonia , even absence injury proximal tubule . With sustained lipid load proximal tubule exceeds oxidative capacity , lipid storage first activate time , toxic lipid metabolite may build . We evidence excess saturate fat , prevalent Western diet , lead proximal tubule lipotoxicity manifest endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) leakage/stress , propose defective ammoniagenesis part broad lipotoxic phenotype . We propose accumulation specific lipid specie may responsible toxicity . To test whether proximal tubule steatosis lipotoxicity humans functional consequence , study uric acid stone former . Having previously show thiazolidinediones ( TZD ) reduce renal steatosis lipotoxicity improve ammonium excretion animal , initiate randomize intervention trial TZD placebo human uric acid stone former . The interim analysis show 6 month TZD therapy , stone former improve urinary biochemical parameter reduce propensity uric acid precipitation . We continue trial add novel highly sensitive method non-invasively measure renal fat , test whether improvement urinary biochemistry associate reduction renal fat . This proposal address fundamental concept renal tubular lipid biology lipotoxicity , clinically shift paradigm uric acid stone therapy empiric urinary alkalinization specific reduction renal fat . We also introduce cutting-edge human image study kidney research .</detailed_description>
