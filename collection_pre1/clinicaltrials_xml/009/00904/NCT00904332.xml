	<brief_summary>Objective When learn tap rhythm brain coordinate information different sens ( eye , ear , touch ) . This information integrate movement plan allow smooth , continuous performance . Two brain area particular interest task posterior parietal cortex integrate sensory motor information primary motor cortex send movement command muscle . These area communicate via nerve connection . The goal research proposal examine strength connection area change practice simple tap task change connection strength depend rhythms show visual auditory stimulus . Additionally investigate ability tap rhythm relate cognitive ability like problem solving . Study Population We intend study 20 adult healthy volunteer outpatient basis . Design In three experimental session propose use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electro encephalography ( EEG ) examine role posterior parietal cortex motor learn . In session 1 neurological examination perform clinical anatomical MRI ( Magnet Resonance Image ) take . Session 1 skip MRI neurological exam perform NIH last year . In session 2 TMS use examine connection posterior parietal cortex primary motor cortex rhythm training . Additionally , EEG record training session . In session 3 examine ability tap different beat relate high cognitive function . We record EEG tap simple beat administer pen paper problem-solving test . Outcome Measures In session 2 primary outcome measure change condition Motor Evoked Potential ( MEP ) peak-to-peak amplitude learn temporal motor sequence measure primary motor cortex . A secondary outcome measure interregional coherence change measure EEG training . In session 3 primary outcome performance tap task pen paper test well interregional coherence change measure EEG tap task .</brief_summary>
