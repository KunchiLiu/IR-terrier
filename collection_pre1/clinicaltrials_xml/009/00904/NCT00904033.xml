	<brief_summary>Both calcitriol exercise intervention aim reduce fracture risk maintain proper bone density , thereby prevent osteoporotic/osteopenic condition increase muscle mass . Both calcitriol exercise efficacious maintain proper bone health muscle mass among general population , little research do breast cancer patient survivor . The combination calcitriol exercise , function different similar mechanism , could produce interactive effect reduce fracture risk among breast cancer survivor . Hypothesis : A combination calcitriol along structured home-based walk progressive resistance exercise program efficacious prevent bone resorption increase bone formation among survivor invasive breast cancer . Primary Objective To collect data efficacy feasibility supplementation calcitriol with/without accompany structure home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program improve bone health among breast cancer survivor . Secondary Objectives To collect data efficacy feasibility supplementation calcitriol with/without accompany structure home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program increase strength among breast cancer survivor . To collect data efficacy feasibility supplementation calcitriol with/without accompany structure home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program improve skeletal muscle mass among breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
