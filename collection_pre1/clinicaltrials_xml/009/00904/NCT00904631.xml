	<brief_summary>Name Device : Eraser Tattoo Removal Device Device Description : The Eraser device mechanical device , resemble tattoo device innovative mechanism drip treatment fluid reciprocate needle return use fluid reservoir chamber . The device intend removal tattoo . Objectives : This study continuation previous feasibility study , test ability device remove tattoos small skin area . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Eraser Tattoo Removal system removal skin tattoo entirety . Subject Population : 20 patient medical center . Subject enrollment include ( ) variety tattoo color ( multiple color ) ( ii ) variety tattoo composition , contour line shading ( iii ) Subjects different skin color ( white , tanned , dark , etcâ€¦ ) ( iv ) professional amateur tattoo . Structure : A prospective , non-randomized , open , clinical study design accord FDA guideline ; ISO 14155 : standard clinical study medical device ; procedure Israeli Ministry Health clinical study . After informed consent sign , demographic detail medical history take physical examination perform . Subjects treat Eraser device , use salicylic acid ( 5 % ) wash fluid . The skin examine physician tattoo area photograph . The Eraser device use remove tattoo entire tattoo area ( 30 minute single session ) . An absorbent bandage put treated area one-hour post treatment . After Care Treatment , base Dermatologist 's consultation , perform case-by-case basis ( example , use antibiotic ointment case infection ) . All subject must refrain exposure sun 90 day follow treatment . Follow-up : The subject return follow-up one week , two week , 1 month two month ( tattoo removal skin heal complete ) , six month ( skin healing/ tattoo removal complete two month ) , heal tattoo removal site completely resolve investigator determines additional treatment provide benefit patient . In follow-up visit , physician perform physical examination , check skin around treatment area , take photograph treat area . Images last follow-up compare image site take removal procedure , evaluation treatment efficacy safety . Repeat treatment : tattoo removal complete , two additional treatment perform , base investigator 's discretion . After treatment , follow-up continue describe . Blinding : Non-Applicable Concurrent Control : There concurrent control group study . Images tattoo treatment serve reference measure , image heal skin , several week tattoo removal , compare . Sample Size : 20 subject enrol study . Primary Effectiveness Variables : The primary measure effectiveness pigment clearance , evaluate image comparison 1-5 analog scale ( 5 - 81-100 % clearance- excellent removal ; 4 - 61-80 % - good removal ; 3 - 41-60 % - moderate removal ; 2 - 21-40 % - fair removal ; 1 - 0-20 % - poor removal ) . Effectiveness calculate total study group individual sub-groups ( skin type , pigment color , etc. ) . Effectiveness analyze separately area affect ( percentage treat area show reaction treatment ) change color brightness ( , due technical reason , part tattoo show major effect , area evaluate change color brightness ) . For analysis , scale use . For safety assessment , rate systemic dermatologic adverse event calculate report . The data list type event severity . Specifically , textural change , hypo- hyper- pigmentation follow rate calculate . Data Analysis : For clinical study , descriptive statistic use . Successful treatment result 3 ( least , moderate tattoo removal ) brightness change scale . Study Sponsor : Hawk Medical Technologies Ltd .</brief_summary>
