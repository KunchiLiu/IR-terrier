	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody CT-011 Combination With Rituximab Patients With Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . CT-011 design strengthen immune system cancer , possibly help immune cell kill lymphoma cell well . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive infusion CT-011 every 4 week total 4 infusion . The first infusion take least 2 hour give needle vein . Later infusion take least 1 hour . You must stay hospital 2 hour infusion . If lymphoma remain stable shrink 4 infusion CT-011 , may receive 8 additional infusion CT-011 every 4 week , total 12 infusion . You receive rituximab infusion needle vein week total 4 infusion . The first infusion rituximab begin 17 day first infusion CT-011 . Each rituximab infusion give 4-8 hour . You watch carefully , , CT-011 rituximab infusion case experience side effect drug . You give Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) 30 60 minute infusion order low risk possible side effect . If doctor think need , may also give drug hydrocortisone prednisone ( also know corticosteroid ) help low risk possible side effect . If side effect become intolerable , doctor think necessary , infusion may stop short time stop completely . Study Visits : The following test perform schedule study visit . Within 30 day first infusion study drug ( 2 week screen test complete ) : - Blood ( 4 ½ tablespoon ) draw research test design study function immune cell body . - Up 5 needle biopsy ( mandatory ) collect enlarged lymph node collect tumor tissue research test . To collect needle biopsy , area tumor numb anesthetic , small amount tumor tissue withdrawn use needle . Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn research test check level CT-011 blood measure immune system respond drug . These drawn right 2 hour infusion CT-011 , Days 7 , 24 , 31 , 38 , 43 . About 24 hour first CT-011 infusion : -Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon ) draw research test learn study drug activates immune cell . Before first rituximab infusion : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon ) draw research test learn study drug activates immune cell longer 2 week . Before second , third , fourth CT-011 infusion : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon ) draw immune-response research test . Before third CT-011 infusion : - You x-ray CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check disease status . You may also PET scan doctor think need . - If bone marrow affect lymphoma start study , 2 bone marrow biopsies 1 bone marrow aspirate collect , check disease status . About 4 week fourth infusion CT-011 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You x-ray CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status lymphoma . You may also PET scan doctor think need . - If bone marrow affect lymphoma start therapy , 2 bone marrow biopsies 1 bone marrow aspirate collect check status disease . - Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon ) draw immune-response research study . Before CT-011 infusion 5 12 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Length Study : You may continue receive CT-011 total 12 infusion . You take study intolerable side effect disease get bad . Long-Term Follow-Up : You ask return clinic follow long-term follow-up test : About every 3 month complete 4 infusion CT-011 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ECG final study completion visit . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You x-ray CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check disease status . If CT scan show lymphoma go away completely visit , may also PET scan 2 bone marrow biopsies 1 bone marrow aspirate collect confirm disease status . At 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month end treatment : -Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon time ) draw immune-response research study . This investigational study . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , include follicular lymphoma . CT-011 FDA approve commercially available . At time , drug use research . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
