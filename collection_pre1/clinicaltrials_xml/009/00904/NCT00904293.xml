	<detailed_description>Almost 20 million prescription write warfarin year US yet one problematic drug modern medical formulary . Warfarin narrow therapeutic window hemorrhagic thrombotic implication modest over- under-dosing devastating . Warfarin one lead cause emergency department visit hospitalization due adverse drug event worldwide . Adverse event warfarin common initial month treatment optimal dose determine . Moreover , substantial individual variation response warfarin necessitate frequent monitoring dosage adjustment . The monitoring dose warfarin problematic many primary care physician abdicate role specialize `` warfarin clinic '' devote solely follow patient agent . Unfortunately , good alternative warfarin exist common indication require chronic anticoagulation atrial fibrillation , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , artificial heart valve . Pharmacogenomics offer substantial hope improve care patient take warfarin . One group estimate formally integrate genetic test routine warfarin therapy US could result avoidance 85,000 serious bleed event 17,000 stroke annually cost saving $ 1 billion annually . Common single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene encode Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase ( VKOR ) substantially affect one 's sensitivity warfarin , mediate double halve dose require optimal anticoagulation . Warfarin inhibit clot inhibit enzyme VKOR , thus inhibit vitamin K dependent clotting factor . A number recent retrospective study show polymorphism VKOR gene may account 20-30 % variance warfarin dose see patient stable , long-term warfarin therapy . Another genetic determinant variance warfarin dose cytochrome p450 2C9 enzyme CYP2C9 . It almost wholly responsible metabolism active S-enantiomer warfarin . The 2C9*2 2C9*3 polymorphism CYP2C9 gene associate reduced warfarin metabolism , number retrospective study show polymorphism may account 10-15 % variance warfarin dosage patient stable , long-term warfarin therapy . In addition , variant CYP2C9 allele associate longer time stabilization INR high risk bleed event . These polymorphism see ~20-30 % Caucasian population , rare African Americans Asians . Together , know VKOR CYP2C9 variant may account 40 % variability warfarin dose . By combine clinical information weight , height , concomitant medication VKOR CYP2C9 genotypic information , several algorithm devise calculate warfarin dos . These algorithms show accurately predict warfarin dos retrospective study patient already long-term stable warfarin dos . Some small , pilot study orthopedic patient suggest prospective genetic-based dose feasible may result achieve stable dos sooner patient certain genetic variant . However , prospective study small , pilot study limit orthopedic patient include medical patient common indication require chronic oral anticoagulation . They also limit study design include historical control . No RCTs report literature evaluation need determine utility cost-effectiveness genetic-based algorithm . The NHLBI planning double-blind , randomize three-arm trial , trial begin enrol subject 2008 early data analysis dissemination plan begin beyond 2011 .</detailed_description>
