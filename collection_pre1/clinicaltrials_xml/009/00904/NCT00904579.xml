	<brief_summary>Background : - Solid organ transplantation provide life-saving treatment end-stage organ disease associate increase cancer risk need long-term immunosuppression - End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , common type end-stage organ disease lead transplant , link increase risk cancer - The role immunosuppression factor cause cancer set fully understood . Objectives : - To characterize cancer risk transplant recipient identify risk factor . - To characterize risk transmission cancer organ donor recipient . - To describe cancer risk ESRD . Eligibility : Patients require study . Data gather exist database ESRD patient , organ transplant patient cancer registry . Design : - Databases 1 ) U.S. transplant recipient , donor wait list candidate 2 ) U.S. ESRD patient link multiple U.S. cancer registry identify cancer transplant recipient ESRD patient . - The spectrum cancer risk transplant recipient ESRD patient evaluate detail . - The cancer risk transplant recipient examine relation whether donor cancer . - The propose cancer risk factor ( e.g. , underlie medical condition , infection cancer-causing virus , immunosuppressive medication ) document transplant ESRD file study association increase risk particular type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Solid organ transplantation provide life-saving treatment end-stage organ disease associate substantially elevate cancer risk , largely due need maintain long-term immunosuppression . Despite previous research , important research question remain concerning role immunosuppression factor cause cancer setting . The investigator propose link database U.S. transplant recipient ( 458,834 transplant , 1987-June 2010 ) , donor , wait list candidate , multiple U.S. cancer registry . This linkage allow identification incident cancer transplant recipient . Using data , investigator conduct detailed evaluation spectrum cancer risk transplant recipient . Additionally , investigator examine cancer risk transplant recipient relation whether donor cancer , study possible donor-to-recipient transmission cancer . The investigator also study whether propose cancer risk factor ( e.g. , underlie medical condition , infection oncogenic virus , immunosuppressive medication ) , document transplant file , associate increase risk particular type cancer .</detailed_description>
