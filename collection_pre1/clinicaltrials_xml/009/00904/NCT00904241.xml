	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Newly Diagnosed Neuroblastoma Ganglioneuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively analyze factor currently use risk-group assignment ( v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derive homolog [ MYCN ] copy number fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] , deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] content flow cytometry , tumor histology use International Neuroblastoma Pathologic Classification System ) neuroblastoma tumor time diagnosis . II . To maintain reference bank contain clinically genetically characterize frozen tumor tissue , tumor DNA ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , histology slide paraffin block , neuroblastoma-derived cell line , patient serum pair normal DNA obtain time diagnosis , time second-look surgery time relapse future research study . III . To prospectively analyze 1p , 11q , 14q 17q allelic status , MYCN copy number quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ; expression pattern neurotrophin-related gene diagnostic neuroblastoma tumor , assay presence rare tumor cell biological specimen reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR ; biological variable analyze independent clinical significance compare MYCN amplification , International Neuroblastoma Staging System ( INSS ) stage , age , ploidy , histologic variable predict either response treatment outcome . IV . To build database know biologic prognostic factor patient therapeutic study . V. To serve Registry neuroblastoma patient whose tumor demonstrate clinical genetic feature define `` Low Risk '' treatment failure absence adjuvant therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively analyze concordance detection MYCN amplification tumor sample quantitative detection MYCN DNA serum , analyze prognostic significance MYCN amplification detect serum sample . II . To build database include information regard presentation natural history neuroblastoma-associated health problem include limited opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia ( OMA ) and/or spinal cord compression . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood , tissue , bone marrow sample analysis via RT-PCR , quantitative PCR , flow cytometry , FISH . After completion study , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
