	<brief_summary>Breathlessness extremely common uncomfortable symptom report two-thirds person tetraplegia . This disordered pulmonary function due respiratory muscle paralysis sympathetic denervation result restrictive impairment airway hyperreactivity , respectively . These restrictive obstructive dysfunction associate symptom breathlessness . However , mechanism contribute dyspnea person tetraplegia well understood . It demonstrate person tetraplegia increase prevalence breathlessness may alter breathing pattern . The purpose study determine breathe pattern rest measure change breathe bronchodilator treatment ( medicine commonly use treat asthma relaxes open airway ) . The determination breathe pattern do measuring movement chest wall breathing . This design elucidate difference breathe pattern tetraplegia control , well demonstrate effect bronchodilatation motor drive timing . Knowledge intraindividual variability mean value component breathe pattern improve understand breathlessness individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Breathing Pattern Dyspnea Subjects With Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate mechanism dyspnea tetraplegia . This goal accomplish complete follow specific objective : 1 . To noninvasively assess dyspnea , motor drive , respiratory time prolonged period rest breathing . 2 . To determine relationship exist breathe pattern component dyspnea . 3 . To determine relationship among respiratory timing , drive , dyspnea alter bronchodilator duration action . These specific objective use test hypothesis : 1 . During prolonged period rest breathing , respiratory timing alter motor drive increase less variable able-bodied control . 2 . There positive association motor drive dyspnea . 3 . Improving respiratory mechanic bronchodilator administration reduce drive , normalize timing lessen dyspnea duration action drug . Completion propose study expand exist knowledge ventilatory control person tetraplegia relate change dyspnea , common distress clinical problem individual . These study also provide good characterization breathe pattern intrasubject variability person tetraplegia . Currently , information regard breathing pattern tetraplegia limited duration ( 15-30 minute ) . If pilot study reveals significant relationship motor drive , timing , dyspnea , compile `` normative '' data breathe pattern large number individual tetraplegia may useful evaluate dyspnea different clinical setting .</detailed_description>
