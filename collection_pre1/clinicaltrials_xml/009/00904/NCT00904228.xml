	<brief_summary>The purpose research project ascertain effectiveness plastic head cover prevention hypothermia . Hypothermia define body temperature &lt; 36.5º Celsius World Health Organization . The surface area head 20 % total body surface newborn infant major source heat loss . The objective compare rectal temperature upon admission neonatal intensive care preterm neonates stockinet head cover plastic-lined stockinet head cover placed delivery room . The investigator aim demonstrate plastic-lined head cover effective stockinet head cover alone maintain body temperature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plastic Hat Trial Prevent Hypothermia Preterm Newborns Delivery Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomize control trial conduct Parkland Memorial Hospital ( PMH ) neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) Dallas , Texas . Consent obtain since : placement plastic and/or stockinet head cover neonate part routine resuscitation care PMH Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) minimal risk preterm neonate involve , post-delivery consent little value since intervention last ~24minutes , obtain informed consent mother labor pain pain medication may difficult . Randomization neonates carry delivery room opening seal , opaque envelope prior birth . Qualified preterm newborn stratify 2 OB EGA group : ( ≤28weeks obstetrical ( OB ) estimate gestational age ( EGA ) 29-32weeks OB EGA . In stratified group , newborns randomize control arm ( stockinet head cover ) intervention arm ( plastic-lined head cover ) . Each arm study sample size 65 , allow 130 infant OB EGA stratify group sample size total 260 . Treatment versus control assign block 8 use random permutation table . The assignment seal opaque envelope non-participant person research . The PMH high-risk resuscitation ( RESUS ) team attend delivery infant ≤32 week OB EGA . The RESUS team comprise resuscitation nurse , respiratory therapist , practitioner . Neonatology fellow and/or attend may also attend delivery . The use warm aid RESUS team standardize follow manner : Randomization envelope open . All infant take obstetrician practitioner Ohio radiant warmer pre-warmed 100 % capacity prior delivery infant . A food-grade storage ( polyethylene ) bag ( refer `` poncho '' ) use infant EGA 32 week less OB EGA decrease evaporative convective heat loss . The poncho place cut hole close end bag purpose insert head . The infant dry except face recommend NRP . All infant ≤28weeks OB EGA transwarmer mattress gel pad activate place radiant warmer resuscitation transport per PMH NICU NRP standard practice . The appropriate head cover place level forehead infant per randomization assignment . If access infant 's umbilical cord need , hole cut appropriate location . All infant transport dedicated isolette resuscitation prewarmed 38ºC . The warm aid place infant 's arrival NICU . The RESUS team gather follow data delivery room : environmental temperature delivery room , rectal temperature immediately delivery , annotation warm aid implement . The RESUS team also care infant first 4 hour life . Initial vital sign ( heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , temperature , need ventilation , need intervention record RESUS team . After 4 hour care assume primary NICU team per standard practice . Once admission rectal temperature take , head covering remove infant longer actively enrol research . The rest data gather Neonatal Resuscitation Database Parkland NICU Morbidity Mortality Database . The rationale study randomize control trial do demonstrate effectiveness placement plastic-lined head cover versus stockinet head cover . It would seem logical measure take decrease heat loss head , measure would improve temperature stability avoid hypothermia premature neonate .</detailed_description>
