	<brief_summary>Many woman heavy period associate low blood , tiredness inability carry normal activity . Approximately 10-30 % woman underlie bleed disorder . There drug call tranexamic acid commonly use effective reduce menstrual flow . However , 1/3 woman side effect common high dos . In medical literature , different dose schedule one commonly recommend Canada . Women underlie bleed disorder may require high dos medication compare . In study , investigator want find low effective dose tranexamic acid girl woman heavy period bleed disorder investigator think low usual recommend dose . If investigator ' result support , may contribute change investigator presently prescribe medication may provide good option woman heavy period particular bleeding disorder .

	<brief_title>The Assessment Tranexamic Acid Women With Menorrhagia Who Have Bleeding Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menorrhagia , heavy menstrual bleeding , represent important health issue premenopausal woman common cause primary care consultation . Approximately 10-15 % woman heavy period . This may associate iron deficiency anemia , fatigue , time lose school , work regular activity . Up 50 % woman menorrhagia underlie bleed disorder functional limitation reduction quality life menstrual period . The literature report 10-30 % woman menorrhagia underlie bleed disorder . The American Society Hematology highlight major public health issue 2006 , ongoing effort address problem . The prevalence bleed disorder normal population 1 100 ; von Willebrand Disease ( VWD ) common . Studies show 57 % 93 % woman bleed disorder menorrhagia . Therefore , woman , present menorrhagia , consider investigation bleed disorder . Obtaining accurate history menorrhagia woman often difficult several reason . Women may reluctant initiate discussion heavy period . Also , woman underlie hereditary bleeding disorder may heavy period since affected woman family consider menses `` normal . '' Not infrequently , mild bleed disorder may go undiagnosed adulthood . Menorrhagia objectively define menstrual blood loss &gt; 80mls . It well know assessment menstrual blood loss history alone unreliable inaccurate . The alkaline hematin method provide objective accurate technique measurement menstrual blood loss consider gold standard . However method time-consuming , readily available clinical use impractical , require woman collect sanitary product entire menstrual cycle . The pictorial blood assessment chart ( PBAC ) simple , non-laboratory method provide semi-quantitative assessment menstrual flow . Using method , patient record number degree saturation pad and/or tampon use 8 day menstrual cycle pictorial chart correspond score calculate . In original report , Higham et al define menorrhagia PBAC score &gt; 100 sensitivity 86 % specificity 81 % . Janssen et al later report cut-off score 185 provide high positive negative predictive value 'true ' menorrhagia oppose score &gt; 100 validated Reid et al , recent publication . In Higham Janssen study confidence interval estimate sensitivity report , therefore difficult select either one definitively well use cut-off score . In study decide use cut-off PBAC score 100 conservative approach allow inclusion patient heavy menstrual flow . There number treatment option woman menorrhagia include hormone therapy ( combined oral estrogen/progesterone , progesterone alone ) , tranexamic acid ( antifibrinolytic agent ) , danazol , non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , progesterone release intrauterine device , , finally , surgical option endometrial ablation hysterectomy . An additional therapy , woman certain bleed disorder ( VWD , platelet dysfunction Hemophilia A carrier ) desmopressin ( DDAVP ) ( intranasal subcutaneous ) . Tranexamic acid first line therapy woman menorrhagia require contraception prefer non-hormonal therapy . It consider standard therapy around world country ( e.g . Canada ) , available prescription , interestingly Sweden obtain 'over-the-counter . ' Antifibrinolytic therapy use almost forty year menorrhagia - first publication 1965 . It previously describe fibrinolysis increase menstrual fluid endometrium woman heavy menstrual flow . Tranexamic acid , fibrinolytic inhibitor , competitively block activation plasminogen plasmin thereby reduce fibrinolysis . Tranexamic acid reduces menstrual blood loss 50 % show least equally effective oral contraceptive , NSAIDs , intranasal desmopressin . There consensus minimal effective dose , dose schedule optimal duration therapy . In published literature , effective dose variable range 1000 mg/day 6000 mg/day . The recommend dose Compendium Pharmaceuticals Specialties ( CPS ) , 2009 , publish Canadian Pharmacists Association , 3000 mg/day 6000 mg/day . The current recommend dose per Clinical Practice Guidelines Management Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Society Obstetricians Gynecologists Canada Canadian Hemophilia Society document Management Women Bleeding Disorders 1000 mg orally four time day . Interestingly , China , recommend give 2000 mg/day . The recommended duration therapy also variable ; CPS state medication start `` flow copious '' take `` several day . '' Most clinical trial use 4-5 day duration therapy . It give different schedule , commonly 3 4 time per day . A recent study compare two dos tranexamic acid , 2000 mg/day vs. 1000 mg/day , dose give twice-a-day schedule , additional placebo arm , assess effect prevention menorrhagia woman intrauterine device ( IUDs ) . The woman randomize tranexamic acid arm significantly less menstrual flow compare placebo group significant difference efficacy two dos tranexamic acid . Women underlie bleed disorder may need high dos woman without bleed disorder ; however , uncertain . This medication without toxicity one-third woman experience side effect dose dependant . The common adverse effect nausea , vomit , diarrhea , less common , headache , dizziness allergic reaction . Tranexamic acid expensive ; retail price $ 1.34/500-mg capsule . For example dose 4000 mg/day 5 day would cost patient $ 64.34/month include dispense fee . Common reason discontinue medication include side effect , cost inconvenience associate multiple dosing . Many patient adjust dose - find balance efficacy , minimal toxicity , cost , frequency dosing . It experience patient find balance minimal dose 500 mg take twice daily . In study propose investigate whether minimal effective tolerate dose tranexamic acid , base PBAC score , quality life factor , tolerability side effect less current Canadian recommend dose 1000 mg orally four time day . Study Objectives : - Primary Objective - To determine minimal effective tolerate dose tranexamic acid girl woman menorrhagia bleed disorder lower current dose 1000 mg orally , four time day , recommend Clinical Practice Guidelines Management Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Society Obstetricians Gynecologists Canada Canadian Hemophilia Society document Management Women Bleeding Disorders . - Secondary Objectives - To determine accurate estimate proportion woman present clinic menorrhagia underlie bleed disorder . Based literature expect 10 % -30 % . - To determine effect body mass index ( BMI ) , age , dose-related side effect , concurrent medication quality life factor optimal dose tranexamic acid . Study hypotheses : - Primary hypothesis - The minimal effective tolerate dose tranexamic acid require woman menorrhagia bleed disorder lower current Canadian recommendation 1000 mg orally , four time daily ( 4000 mg/day ) . - Secondary hypothesis - The true proportion woman menorrhagia bleed disorder under-reported . - Women menorrhagia without bleed disorder require low dose tranexamic acid woman menorrhagia bleed disorder . - In addition presence bleed disorder , likely factor include age , BMI , tolerance side effect , subjective assessment bleeding , quality life issue compliance impact dose tranexamic acid woman menorrhagia . - A decision tool develop aid dose woman menorrhagia base risk factor presence bleed disorder , age BMI .</detailed_description>
