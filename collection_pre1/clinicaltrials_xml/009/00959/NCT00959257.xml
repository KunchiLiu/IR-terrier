	<detailed_description>Globally , cardiovascular disease major cause mortality morbidity . In past 2 decade Hong Kong , second lead cause death , death rate reach 50/100,000 population 2006 , third lead cause hospitalization Hospital Authority Hospitals 2001-2005 . The disease burden huge effective control measure target prevention level . There substantial evidence landmark epidemiological study past 10 year chronic low grade systemic inflammation , predominantly base plasma hs-CRP , independent predictor development hypertension , myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death peripheral vascular disease . A dose-dependent risk association hs-CRP cardiovascular morbidity also consistently demonstrate . Asthma chronic inflammatory airway disorder associate airflow obstruction bronchial hyper-responsiveness , affect 10 % population Hong Kong . It major respiratory disease Hong Kong carry significant morbidity high hospitalization burden age . The use long-term inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) treatment recent decade become cornerstone treatment patient persistent asthma reduction mortality hospital utilization . The ultimate goal treatment achieve optimal control airway inflammation reduce mortality morbidity . Although pathogenesis asthma incompletely understood , study show associated airway inflammation state increase free radical formation , cell derive airways peripheral blood patient asthma generate increased amount reactive oxygen specie , level related severity asthma . Recent preliminary study indicate , apart presence chronic airway inflammation , asthma may also associate chronic low grade systemic inflammation increase oxidative stress . Intuitively , asthma-related systemic inflammation may increase risk development cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Despite propensity asthma towards cardiovascular morbidity , recently , several epidemiological study utilize large number patient asthma show long term use ICS independently associate protective effect towards development myocardial infarction cardiovascular mortality , protective risk 0.35 ( 95 % CI 0.13-0.93 ) . This effect possibly mediate reduction low grade systemic inflammation reflect plasma hs-CRP systemic absorption ICS . This potential effect ICS reduction chronic low grade systemic inflammation invaluable implication future application preventive medicine development cardiovascular morbidity mortality , especially high risk patient . ICS launch 20 year , currently first-line treatment asthma . Their systemic side effect much less oral corticosteroid . Long term safety ICS adult generally high , mild increase risk osteoporosis , cataracts glaucoma report patient high dose ICS use . The purpose study explore potential protective effect ICS cardiovascular morbidity underlie link systemic inflammation Chinese adult asthma compare match control general population .</detailed_description>
