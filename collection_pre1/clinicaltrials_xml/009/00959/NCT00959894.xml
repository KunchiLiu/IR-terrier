	<brief_summary>The main study single arm , open-label , prospective study assess antiretroviral activity tolerability etravirine ( TMC-125 ) 400 mg daily , give fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine , treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected men woman . There also genital secretion pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sub-study metabolic sub-study . The purpose genital secretion PK sub-study gain information drug level HIV-1 RNA genital secretion subject take etravirine . The purpose metabolic sub-study learn effect etravirine body composition , well lipid glucose level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Once Daily Etravirine Treatment-Naive Adults With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : There approximately 80 HIV-1-infected men woman age 18 year old take less equal 10 day prior antiretroviral therapy never take etravirine , dapivirine ( TMC120 ) , rilpivirine ( TMC 278 ) main study . There approximately 40 subject enroll main study metabolic sub-study approximately 20 subject ( 10 pre-menopausal woman 10 men ) enroll main study genital secretion PK sub-study . Procedures ( method ) : For main study subject take etravirine 400 mg daily orally fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine ( Truvada ) one tablet daily . For genital secretion PK sub-study , genital secretion sample self-collected throughout study except week 4 study visit woman cervicovaginal sample time 0 24 hour collect study staff . For metabolic sub-study , waist measurement dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan performed entry , week 24 , week 96 , 2-3 teaspoon blood check lipid , insulin , glucose take entry week 12 , 24 , 48 , 96 .</detailed_description>
