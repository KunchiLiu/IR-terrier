	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify gene related cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study blood tumor sample men inherit risk prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Blood Tumor Samples From Men With Inherited Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To find gene predispose prostate cancer ( use genetic linkage molecular biology technique ) . - To determine gene predispose prostate cancer associate disease treatment parameter . - To determine gene predispose prostate cancer associate environmental factor . - To estimate percentage prostate cancer patient positive family history disease . - To estimate relative risk develop prostate cancer currently unaffected member prostate cancer family . - To ascertain whether relative prostate cancer patient increase risk develop cancer prostate cancer . - To build large blood tumor ( fresh preserve ) bank patient prostate cancer identify prostate cancer predisposition gene ( ) , determine prevalence penetrance prostate cancer predisposition gene prostate cancer patient , correlate change prostate cancer predisposition gene ( ) disease treatment parameter match clinical data clinical database already hold part medical record patient , correlate change prostate cancer predisposition gene ( ) environmental factor collect questionnaire patient . - To use blood tumor bank marker study ( DNA , RNA , serum , plasma , protein , molecule ) define role marker disease prediction progression . - To develop microarrays prostate cancer determine genetic profile correlate prostate cancer genetic predisposition gene . - To collect tissue unaffected affect member family case genetic alteration find , order ascertain whether alteration associate disease risk . - To collect tissue sample unaffected family member show interest take part study . OUTLINE : Patients assess family history epidemiology questionnaire undergo medical record review . Patients relatives prostate cancer may undergo blood sample collection genetic analysis prostate cancer predisposition gene measurement marker association genetic change associate prostate cancer . Blood tumor sample store future study .</detailed_description>
