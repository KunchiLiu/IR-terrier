	<brief_title>Exercise Intolerance Elderly Patients With Diastolic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure normal ejection fraction ( HFNEF , previously term diastolic heart failure ) , account majority heart failure case population &gt; 65 year old recognize true geriatric syndrome . Exercise intolerance primary chronic symptom HFNEF major determinant patient ' severely reduce quality life ; however little known regard pathophysiology treatment . Therefore , work focus understanding pathophysiology exercise intolerance HFNEF develop test intervention may improve pivotal outcome highly prevalent disorder old person . The aim propose study conduct randomize , control , single-blinded , 2x2 design trial examine effect weight loss via hypocaloric diet , aerobic exercise training , combine hypocaloric diet exercise training , attention control patient HFNEF body mass index &gt; 30 order test follow hypothesis : 1 ) Both weight loss exercise training improve exercise intolerance quality life old , obese patient HFNEF ; 2 ) The combination weight loss exercise training produce complementary effect body thigh muscle composition additive improvement exercise intolerance HFNEF ; 3 ) Improvements exercise intolerance correlate improvement lean body mass , reversal adverse thigh muscle remodeling , increase thigh muscle capillarity . The study potential significantly advance understand exercise intolerance treatment large population old person HFNEF .</detailed_description>
