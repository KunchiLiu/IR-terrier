	<brief_summary>Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) exposure kill injure thousand child family year . Although grow concern need increase carbon monoxide detector use , little known best , especially low-income family . The objective research determine whether brief intervention , Project Carbon Monoxide Detector Education ( Project CODE ) , increase CO detector use . For study , parent child , 18 year young , randomly assign receive Project CODE ( educational tool CO detector ) usual care ( fly CO poisoning ) ; deliver Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) examination room . The use CO detector participant 's current stage theory stage-based behavior change—the Precaution Adoption Process Model ( PAPM ) , assess enrollment home visit occur two-weeks six-months following PED visit . The investigator hypothesize parent receive Project CODE work CO detector along PAPM parent control group two-week six-month home visit . The long term goal research reduce number injury death CO poisoning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poisoning Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) among lead cause non-fatal injury treat US hospital emergency departments account approximately 500 unintentional death year . Known effective countermeasure detect CO reduce CO poison exist , yet routinely utilized . Although increase concern need increase CO detector use , little known best , especially low income family . This research aim address gap , apply theory stage-based behavior change—the Precaution Adoption Process Model PAPM ) —to brief intervention feasible busy emergency department set . A randomized trial conduct involve 300 family child 18 year younger . In Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) , eligible parent randomly assign receive Project CODE intervention ( educational tool CO detector ) usual care ( fly CO poisoning ) . The use CO detector participant 's PAPM stage assess enrollment follow-up home visit occur two-weeks six-months following PED visit . We hypothesize parent receive Project CODE work CO detector along PAPM parent control group two-week six-month follow-up home visit . By examine extent intervention increase CO detector use , finding also demonstrate innovative health communication ( brief intervention deliver PED ) reduce risk injury among vulnerable child . This research build extend investigator ' previous work behavioral theory , injury prevention intervention deliver PED , development evaluation interactive educational tool safety practice . The specific aim project follow : Aim 1—Determine whether brief intervention increase CO detector use PAPM stage among parent whose child see PED compare parent child receive routine care CO flyer ; Aim 2—Determine whether extent socioeconomic status moderate effect intervention . Findings research study theoretical practical application improve injury prevention service PEDs . This single-site efficacy trial first step determine whether brief intervention PED successfully increase CO detector use .</detailed_description>
