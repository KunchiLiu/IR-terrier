	<brief_summary>This study design capture large group patient undergo pulmonary rehabilitation map progression 5 year time-frame . The outcome measure choose capture physiological , functional capacity , free-living activity plus admission exacerbation rate thereby enhance understand potential effect exercise self management technique may disease progression . Pulmonary rehabilitation show reduce inflammation ; therefore , unlike acute exacerbation 's decrease inflammation indicate recovery , exact mechanism responsible improvement pulmonary rehabilitation yet unknown .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Impact Pulmonary Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit pulmonary rehabilitation well document elsewhere , however , exact mechanism responsible significant improvement alteration disease progression unexplained . Also unexplained apparent lack carry functional capacity free-living activity measure activity monitor . There report effect decrease level inflammatory cytokine C-reactive protein ( CRP ) post rehabilitation , however , train response reactive oxidative stress ( ROS ) moderate intensity pulmonary rehabilitation programme report . As oxidative stress catalyst inflammation , train response exercise induce ROS patient COPD may also secondary effect modify inflammation stable COPD patient thereby improve patient outcome . No study to-date combine free-living activity , biomarkers standard outcome measure patient 's pre post pulmonary rehabilitation follow-up patient five year period . Subjects refer pulmonary rehabilitation fulfil GOLD criterion COPD recruit roll basis randomly allocate one two group . Group 1 ( Control ) , Group 2 ( Intervention ) . It multi-centred , randomise control trial use convenience sample patient refer pulmonary rehabilitation meet inclusion/exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
