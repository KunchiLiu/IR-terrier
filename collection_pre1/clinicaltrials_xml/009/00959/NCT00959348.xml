	<brief_summary>Inhaled steroid cornerstone treatment asthma , carry huge patient population worldwide include Hong Kong . In general , safety long-term use inhale steroid well document . Yet , long-term user treatment carry increase risk complication like cataract . In particular , exact association inhale steroid use development diabetes mellitus know , despite clear causal relationship oral steroid use diabetes . Therefore epidemiology study ( base questionnaire blood test ) aim investigate effect inhale corticosteroid risk diabetes , impair glucose tolerance insulin resistance adult asthma . The impact study expect affect current practice long-term use inhale corticosteroid especially among patient asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) show many side effect consistent systemic corticosteroid , suggest systemic absorption lead adverse effect long term user . ICS pose major health impact community , especially use become widely accepted mainstay treatment asthma chronic obstructive airway disease recent decade . In 1997 , inhale corticosteroid show increase risk nuclear cataract 1.5-fold posterior subcapsular cataract 1.9-fold respectively . Besides , high dose ICS use 3 month increase risk open angle glaucoma OR 1.44 . In 1998 , case control study demonstrate positive association cataract extraction elderly ICS user . ICS use 3 year increase cataract 3-fold high dose user ( &gt; 1mg daily budesonide dipropionate ) . Whereas low dose use ( &lt; 1mg daily budesonide dipropionate ) 2 year increase cataract 1.6-fold . Subsequent study also find increase risk osteoporosis long term ICS user . It well know systemic corticosteroid cause diabetes induce insulin resistance . Previous study show 2-fold increase risk diabetes patient use systemic corticosteroid . Nevertheless , many systemic side effect know inhaled corticosteroid , effect risk diabetes establish yet . There also 2 small scale study effect ICS insulin resistance profile , however , study finding also inconclusive . In 1987 , study 9 subject , give 4 week inhale budesonide dipropionate 1mg daily , show increase 2-hour peak glucose level oral glucose tolerance test , also increase fast serum insulin concentration , suggest ICS use associate glucose dysregulation increase insulin resistance . Subsequently , 1993 , another study 15 subject unstable asthma compare 15 normal control subject , reduction insulin resistance patient uncontrolled asthma note upon 1 month ICS treatment ; insulin resistance profile become static 5 8 month therapy . This study suggest insulin resistance profile increase subject unstable asthma relation stress induced exacerbation . ICS reduce insulin resistance profile stabilize asthma control . In term research relate ICS diabetes , limited study elderly . In 1998 , study show dose dependent worsen diabetic control diabetic elderly use high dose ICS . However , 2 subsequent case control study conduct 2002 fail demonstrate association diabetes elderly either current use ICS 3 year use ICS . These study result subject confound concurrent systemic corticosteroid usage , lack long term user ICS , well effect compete cause diabetes ( ie . age obesity ) strong elderly impact ICS risk diabetes might mask particular group patient . So far , data lack term association inhale corticosteroid diabetes , well impaired glucose tolerance - pre-diabetic condition . Moreover , profile glucose regulation potential hyperinsulinemia ICS user normal glucose tolerance largely unexplored . As Asians increase risk develop NIDDM , effect ICS inducing diabetes Chinese might prominent subject western country . It clinical significance relevance study issue Chinese dominant community like Hong Kong . Therefore , shall investigate effect ICS , try understand impact whole disease spectrum insulin resistance . We shall begin study risk diabetes , move impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) finally explore potential hyperinsulinemia subject normal glucose tolerance use ICS . We also put particular emphasis young Chinese population , impact age obesity less mark , therefore , effect ICS risk DM/IGT/ hyperinsulinemia well manifest delineate . About 10 % population asthma , 50 % long term inhale corticosteroid . While asthma know cause diabetes hence confounder association ICS DM , shall therefore target adult Chinese asthma patient use ICS study subject , compare risk diabetes/IGT/hyperinsulinemia group patient general population . Since diabetes mellitus major health problem strongly associate multiple cardiovascular morbidity mortality , inhale corticosteroid commonly prescribe drug treat chronic airway disease , knowledge regard risk DM association chronic ICS use major impact public health .</detailed_description>
