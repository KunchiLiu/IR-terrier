	<detailed_description>Almost critically ill child mechanically ventilate require sedation analgesia . Providing effective sedation child PICU require careful balance need sedation adverse effect associate sedative medication . Inadequate sedation may result undue pain suffer child , ventilator dysynchrony may risk removal life sustain device . Excess sedation limit patient ' interaction parent care-givers may result delayed wean mechanical ventilation , prolong PICU stay attendant risk increase morbidity . Critically ill child may also experience withdrawal medication stop . Randomized trail adult show sedation relate intervention improve patient outcomes , trial perform child . Clonidine often use adjunctive sedative analgesic child well design adequately power randomized trial require test effect clonidine-based sedation . Because large randomized trial sedation relate intervention among critically ill child many unknown factor . This pilot trial , focus feasibility outcomes assess feasibility , inform design , large randomize control trial focus clinically important outcome .</detailed_description>
