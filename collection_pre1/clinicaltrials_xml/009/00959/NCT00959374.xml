	<brief_title>Evaluation Dermal Closure With Absorbable Barbed Suture Compared Conventional Absorbable Suture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One great common challenge surgical procedure effectively efficiently close wound across various level muscle , fat , fascia and/or skin . Surgical suture continue material choice wound closure . However , complication suture associate tie knot secure suture . Examples associated suture complication , although comprehensive , include knot breakage slippage , suture extrusion spitting , infection , ischemia scarring , reduce wound strength inflammation dehiscence . Both interrupted continuous suture pattern require knot suture line security conventional suture construct use . Barbed suture design eliminate need tie knot closure , thus ameliorate detrimental aspect knot .</detailed_description>
