	<brief_summary>Rationale : Consumption vegetable generally consider associated several positive effect health . Vegetables heterogeneous group diet rich bio-actives . The vegetable contain range vitamin , mineral , dietary fibre phytochemical like potassium , flavonoid , carotenoid , vitamin C. The recommended intake vegetable Dutch Health Council 200 gram daily ( Health Council , 2006 ) . Health project define possibility subject change adapt easily response certain challenge . Healthy subject show resilience different physiological process relate oxidative stress , metabolic stress , neurological stress inflammatory stress . The reaction/response challenge might change subject consume less vegetable improve health status . The response might also differentiate subject differ BMI ( healthy weight versus overweight/obese ) . Supplementation vegetable provide two condition : low high daily intake ( 50 versus 200 gram daily ) . An intervention know positive effect health weight loss . This studied relation health ( reaction challenge test ) well . A beneficial effect present 5 % improvement health marker show vegetable supplementation , similar know weight loss study . Objective : The primary objective present study set-up methodology investigate health base resilience challenge . A secondary objective effectiveness challenge concept food intervention . The vegetable supplementation study first example test challenge concept . Therefore , vegetable consumption accord recommendation Dutch Health Council 200 gram vegetable daily study exercise challenge test , investigate beneficial 'health ' effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The study design randomize , cross-over parallel , open study . Study population : The number subject participate study 32 , healthy , lean obese men , age 18-45 year . Intervention : intervention last four week : - High Vegetable treatment : consumption 200 gram vegetable daily ; - Low Vegetable treatment : consumption 50 gram vegetable daily ; - An energy restrict diet intervention habitual vegetable consumption . Main study parameters/endpoints : A 'challenge test ' use physical stress test examine whether subject show less resilience test . The reaction recovery human system exercise test may use indicator health status different biological analysis ( transcriptomics ; metabolomics ; rule base medicine pm ) . Different analysis measure oxidative stress perform . Also standard health biomarkers determine examine intervention effect .</detailed_description>
