	<brief_summary>The mouth may play important part monitoring HIV progression . Mucosal lesions mouth often first sign infection development already diagnosed individual indicate disease progression . In addition , saliva may provide non-invasive way track viral load . The purpose study establish standardized practice examine mouth identify oral mucosal lesion well establish correlation viral load HIV particles find saliva .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The oral cavity find play important role monitoring progression HIV infection . The occurrence specific lesion , mainly oral candidiasis hairy leukoplakia , strongly associate low CD4 cell count high plasma viral load . Furthermore , even though prevalence specific oral lesion like candidiasis , hairy leukoplakia , Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) find low among patient highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , oral lesion wart find prevalent population . In addition , saliva show harbor viral particle , antibody , cytokine , may represent easily noninvasively collect specimen various diagnostic assay , include early diagnosis HIV . The purpose study establish set standardized practice examine diagnose oral mucosal lesion establish correlation amount HIV find saliva viral load . Participants study attend one screen visit study visit assign one four group base viral load CD4 count . Group A consist participant CD4 count 200 cells/mm3 less viral load great 1000 copies/ml . Group B make participant CD4 count 200 cells/mm3 less viral load 1000 copies/ml less . Group C participant CD4 count great 200 cells/mm3 viral load great 1000 copies/ml . Participants make Group D CD4 count great 200 cells/mm3 viral load 1000 copies/ml less . All participant medical history take blood collect well perform throat wash collection whole saliva collection . In addition , two oral exam perform study visit .</detailed_description>
