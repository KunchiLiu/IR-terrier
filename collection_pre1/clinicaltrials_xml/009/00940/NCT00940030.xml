	<brief_title>Comparison Mechanical Bowel Preparation Versus Enema Candidates Colorectal Resection Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) colorectal surgery ( anastomotic leakage , wound infection , intraabdominal abscess ) associate increased mortality , postoperative hospital stay cost . From recent metanalysis randomize clinical trial emerge evidence mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP ) elective colorectal surgery associate reduction SIS , although cause high discomfort patient . On way recent study show MBP may cause high incidence SIS , MBP may alter bowel mucosa morphology . Other Authors report increase incidence anastomotic leakage require surgery patient undergo single preoperative phosphate enema whereas high cardiovascular mortality patient undergoing MBP . Two recent study clarify usefulness MBP reduce SIS colorectal surgery one stage anastomosis . For reason precise understand relationship MBP SIS could increase patient satisfaction decrease unnecessary procedure cost . At point MBP represent clinical standard patient undergoing elective colorectal surgery European Institute Oncology .</detailed_description>
