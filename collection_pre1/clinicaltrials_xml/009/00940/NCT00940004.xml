	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale Immunotherapy apply ex vivo generate tumor-antigen-loaded dendritic cell ( DC ) successfully introduce clinic . A limited , consistent , number objective immunological clinical response observe . Thus far remain unclear patient respond others , general consensus current protocol apply generate DC may result induction optimal Th1 response . We others demonstrate DC maturation one crucial factor , effective DC migration also induce effective anti-tumor immune response cancer patient . Currently , `` golden standard '' use mature DC consist cocktail pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1beta , IL-6 , TNFalpha ) prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) . Recent mouse data demonstrate , however , maturation DC solely pro-inflammatory cytokine yield DC support T cell clonal expansion , fail efficiently direct effector T cell differentiation . Interestingly , DC mature presence Toll like receptor ( TLR ) ligands able induce full T cell effector function unleash potent immune response . We recently identify vaccine infectious disease contain TLR ligands capable induce DC maturation . This knowledge provide new application clinical applicable agent : clinical grade DC stimulators . A clinical grade DC maturation protocol develop TLR ligand ( preventive vaccine ) PGE2 combine result generation mature DC secrete high level key cytokine IL-12 . Moreover , TLR-ligand mature DC induce T cell secrete least 20-fold high level effector cytokine IFNalpha TNFalpha compare DC mature absence TLR ligands . In conclusion , vitro data demonstrate TLR-ligand mature DC promise candidate improve immunological clinical response cancer immunotherapy . 2 . Objectives This exploratory study , consist two part . In part I dose escalation perform primary objective safety different dose TLR-DC . In part II TLR-DC vaccination compare cytokine-matured DC vaccination primary objective part immunological response TLR-DC vaccination , toxicity clinical efficacy secondary objective . These study provide important data safety immunological effect TLR-matured DC . 3 . Study design This study open label prospective exploratory intervention study . 4 . Study population Our study population consist HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma patient , proven expression melanoma associate tumor antigens gp100 tyrosinase . Melanoma patient regional lymph node metastasis radical lymph node dissection plan perform within 2 month inclusion study ( refer stage III ) melanoma patient measurable distant metastasis ( refer stage IV ) include . 5 . Main study endpoints The primary objective study investigate toxicity TLR-DC dose escalation DC number part I , investigate immunological response upon TLR-DC vaccination part II study . Immunological response : 1 . The migratory capacity TLR-ligand mature DC vivo . 2 . The activation immune cell vivo . 3 . The immunological response induce TLR-ligand mature DC load mRNA encode melanoma-associated tumor antigen ( gp100 tyrosinase ) . Safety clinical efficacy secondary objective .</detailed_description>
