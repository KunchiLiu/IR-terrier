	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) In Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GM-CSF drug design stimulate immune system . It increase number certain type blood cell call neutrophil macrophage . Rituximab drug design bind protein , call cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) , surface leukemia cell , allow leukemia cell destroy immune system . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam , include routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . A bone marrow aspirate collect . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Imaging study ( chest x-ray CT scan ) may perform . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive GM-CSF injection skin , three time week eight week . You receive rituximab vein , week four week . Usually , first dose rituximab require several hour complete . Later dos usually shorter , may vary accord individual tolerance . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( Benadryl ) , steroid ( hydrocortisone similar ) give rituximab decrease risk side effect . If side effect occur infusion , need stay hospital observe side effect go away . Other , treatment give outpatient basis . During treatment routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) week . The treatment take 8 week complete . You take study disease get bad side effect become severe . After treatment , complete physical exam , include routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . A bone marrow sample take . Imaging study ( chest x-ray CT scan ) may repeat evaluate effect treatment . If treatment work , doctor may advise receive second time . You return post-treatment evaluation every 6 month 1 year year 3 year start new treatment . This investigational study . GM-CSF rituximab approve FDA clinical use . Their use together study , however , experimental . Up 130 patient may take part study . All patient enrol M.D . Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
