	<brief_summary>Prematurity represent 8 % birth one leading cause infant complication . The preterm premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) represent one-third preterm birth rupture membrane increase risk fetal exposition infection could lead neurological sequel . Classic management woman PPROM 32SA base extension pregnancy risk add complication like secondary infection . Moreover , different study show fetal infection could one important risk factor subsequent neurological complication . However , difficult know good extend pregnancy gain maturity arrest pregnancy avoid risk intrauterine infection . The research objective suggest new strategy manage woman PPROM . With new strategy , investigator seek extend pregnancy much possible investigator would like give birth intrauterine infection . The investigator suggest detect protein associate neurological complication preterm child amniotic liquid find vagina mother . A positive test lead delivery newborn infection . The hypothesis possible study change inflammatory status patient present PPROM repeat detection interleukins vaginal secretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Inflammatory Response Patients With Premature Rupture Membranes With Bedside Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) represent one-third preterm birth lead cause perinatal mortality morbidity . During latency period , several event ascent pathogenic microorganism low genital area could create complication may culminate cerebral palsy . Avoiding intrauterine infection appear one important objective PPROM management . Most author propose conservative management woman PPROM , associate antibiotic therapy corticosteroid administration patient PPROM 30 32 week . The main benefit conservative management prolong pregnancy , benefit must balance risk fetal complication . In effort diminish risk infection link longer latency period , several author propose intentional delivery PPROM . The primary objective comparison result IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHY test do bedside patient ELISA test perform laboratory . The secondary outcome description inflammatory status follow rupture membrane term labor . Vaginal secretion sampling perform premature rupture membrane labor . The bedside test perform immediately sample rest sample frozen . ELISA assay perform sample .</detailed_description>
