	<brief_summary>There increase evidence physical activity childhood adolescence important impact health behavior outcome . Lack physical activity currently major concern total population especially child adolescent . People disability risk health problem general population . Due disability , high risk develop secondary condition may affect health quality life.The goal project develop evaluate new approach treatment child cerebral palsy ( CP ) develop low cost test evaluate motor function natural environment . The overall aim raise awareness , promote , physically active lifestyle Middle East teenager disability due CP mean collaborative Jordanian-Israeli-Palestinian-Moroccan apply research project . Specific objective include : 1 . Evaluation baseline level physical activity large population child teenager CP community participate country long-term monitoring accelerometer . 2 . Conducting randomized clinical trial compare efficacy `` experimental '' physical training program treadmill train program two group . The experimental training program base result recent motor control study , well `` motor learning '' approach facilitate transfer retention learn walking activity . 3 . Disability Advocacy dissemination activity focus program , raise awareness , make use new technology enhance develop skill train personnel work population CP . 4 . Continuing expansion collaborative research effort pertain child teenager physical disability Arab country Israel share skill knowledge exchange visit , meeting seminar joint training , pediatric physiotherapist physical educator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage I : Design A cross sectional research design . Study participant stage I : A total 400 teenager CP monitor stage . All partner project obtain approval experiment human subject local committee . Each subject ( parents/guardians participation minor subject ) able sign inform voluntary consent form , consistent Helsinki Declaration , read detailed explanation oral Q/A session investigator . Recruitment : Prospective focus direct mail personal contact initiate parents/guardians child CP ambulatory . Subsequent screen do phone interview . Participants center/country . 100 teenager CP , age 14-20 yr ( 50 age 14-17 yr 50 age 18-20 yr ) . GMFCS level II ; III IV . Measurements : Stage I : The ActivePal accelerometer research instrument long-term assessment ambulatory activity day-to-day life . Baseline functional status measure intervention , include completion socio-economical questionnaire . Stage II : Randomized control trial three training program improve physical activity level comparison low high cost intervention . Study participant Stage II . Thirty teenager CP center ( total number 120 four center ) match accord age GMFCS level ( II III ) randomly assign one three treatment program . Subjects recruit first stage project . All partner project obtain approval local committee . Each subject ( parents/guardians participation minor subject ) sign inform voluntary consent form , consistent Helsinki Declaration , read detailed explanation letter oral Q/A session investigator . Measurements : 2-Treadmill training measure include total training time , step length , split treadmill velocity gap also record session 3-The gross motor function measure ( GMFM ) dimension D E ( stand , walk , run , jump ) use 4-Mechanical efficiency measure stair-climbing test . Statistical analysis : Repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use determine effect compare three treatment method . The repeated measure factor pre-post measurement group factor functional level ( GMFCS ) treatment method . Differences pre-post measurement among three method also test one-way ANOVA . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
