	<detailed_description>This four-way cross-over study design compare effect three drug use treatment insomnia brain electrical activity healthy middle-aged volunteer sleep . During four treatment phase , volunteer receive either prolonged-release melatonin , temazepam , zolpidem placebo , sequence govern pre-determined randomisation schedule . The study conduct single centre clinical research facility ( Surrey CRC ) . Volunteers eligible follow screening invited return sleep clinic may undergo one-night period acclimatisation study procedure ( polysomnography [ PSG ] screen , Visit 2 ) . Following confirmation participant adhere protocol restriction , include test drug abuse alcohol use , vital sign measure actigraph replace . Twice go sleep awakening , participant complete Karolinska Sleepiness Scale undergo Karolinska Drowsiness Test . Participants undergo polysomnography , series recording brain activity use electroencephalography pattern breathing , eight hour period sleep . In even cannula fit repeat blood sample take remove next morning . During course even three urine sample four blood sample take purpose assay melatonin . Three additional blood sample take night urine collect . On awakening , urine collect participant 's stability assess use Romberg test Heel-to-Toe Gait test . Following PSG screen , volunteer undergo four period study ( Visits 3 6 ) , one night separate least five day , time participant administer either single dose prolonged-release melatonin match placebo , single dose temazepam , zolpidem match placebo . During period , assessment conduct PSG screen repeat except blood sample draw melatonin assay . Prior departure sleep centre participant 's last treatment period ( withdrawal early ) , physical examination include measurement vital sign perform , 12-lead ECG record clinical safety laboratory evaluation repeat . Adverse event concomitant medication record throughout study time screen discontinuation . Two week final treatment period , participant contact telephone confirm whether experienced adverse event since completion study . A person 's melatonin profile widely recognise reliable marker individual 's timing circadian clock . Study participant ' plasma melatonin profile measure PSG visit . Urinary melatonin measure PSG visit treatment period .</detailed_description>
