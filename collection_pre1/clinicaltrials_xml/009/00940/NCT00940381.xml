	<brief_title>Sirolimus Cetuximab Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Cetuximab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein surface cancer cell , call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Sirolimus design block protein call mTOR inside cancer cell . This may interfere growth spread cancer cell possibly kill cancer cell . Study Drug Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level cetuximab sirolimus base join study . Up 9 dose level cetuximab sirolimus test . Three ( 3 ) 9 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination cetuximab sirolimus find . Once high tolerate dose combination cetuximab sirolimus find , 2 group additional participant ( Group 1 Group 2 , 14 participant ) enrol receive study drug dose level . Another 14 participant non-small lung head neck cancer receive study drug dose level , well . Study Drug Administration : Each study `` cycle '' 28 day . Everyday , take sirolimus mouth 1 time day . You take time day food cup water . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , receive cetuximab vein 2 hour . If first dose well tolerate , receive next dose 1 hour . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask current health condition , drug take , experienced side effect . Between Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : -If enrol Group 2 high drug combination dose , tumor biopsy blood ( 1-3 tablespoon ) draw pharmacodynamic ( PD ) testing . About Days 8 22 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About Day 22 Cycles 2 every 1-2 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 4 week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn urine collect pregnancy test able become pregnant . Every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI , and/or PET/CT check status disease . The study doctor think need , perform often . Length Study : You may stay study long benefitting . You take study experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest , cancer get bad . End-of-Study Visit : About 28 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure may perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET/CT check status disease . This investigational study . Sirolimus FDA approve commercially available anti-rejection drug kidney transplant recipient . Cetuximab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal head/neck cancer . The combination drug investigational . Up 137 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
