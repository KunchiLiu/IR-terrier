	<brief_title>Effect Adalimumab Vascular Inflammation Patients With Moderate Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) show independent risk factor myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The risk believe related part systemic inflammation associate disease . Some study suggest treatment RA patient anti-TNF alpha decrease risk MI . However , data effect anti-TNF alpha coronary atherosclerosis . Adalimumab probably best anti-TNF alpha candidate study effect coronary atherosclerosis affinity membrane bound TNF alpha anti-TNF alpha product etanercept high global anti-TNF alpha activity psoriasis patient . This study involve comparison adalimumab administer sub-cutaneously load dose 80 mg follow 40 mg week 1 40 mg every week thereafter total 10 injection ( two 40 mg injection week 0 total dose 80 mg , follow single injection week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 15 ) non systemic treatment psoriasis ( topical therapy and/or UVB therapy ) . Patients randomize ( 2:1 ) either adalimumab topical and/or UVB therapy psoriasis . If pilot study show adalimumab reduces vascular inflammation patient psoriasis , large study could undertake study effect adalimumab coronary atherosclerotic plaque .</detailed_description>
