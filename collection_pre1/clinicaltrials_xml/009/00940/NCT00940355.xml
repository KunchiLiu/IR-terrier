	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness intervention conduct pulmonary nurse patient COPD . The hypothesis sample COPD patient clinically relevant problem health status ( physiological functioning , symptom , functional impairment quality life ) , motivational intervention conduct pulmonary nurse lead patient-tailored treatment improve health status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) disease state characterize airflow fully reversible . Besides problem physiological functioning , patient also experience symptom , functional impairment diminish quality life ( see Vercoulen et al. , 2008 ) . Problems three latter domains health status hardly recognize usual care , remain untreated escalate . This mainly cause two phenomenon : doctor delay patient delay . Doctor delay : physician directly identify symptom , functional impairment , problem quality life . Patient delay : patient report problem health status domains . What necessary screening instrument use routine care identifies patient problem four domain health status . If clinically relevant problem exist , additional treatment recommend , intervention pulmonary nurse indicate . This intervention direct increase awareness exist problem motivate patient additional treatment . By mean screen intervention , problem health status detect treat early , escalation . Treatment patient-tailored , base exist problem four domain health status , eventually lead improve health status . A randomized control trial conduct test hypothesis describe . Based independent clinical interpretation PatientProfileChart ( see Peters et al. , 2009 ) three professional , patient assign one follow group : 1 . Patients clinically relevant problem health status ( group I ) , 2 . Patients clinically relevant problem health status ( group II/III ) . Patients clinically relevant problem health status randomize control group ( group II : usual care deliver outpatient clinic ) experimental group ( group III : intervention conduct pulmonary nurse , direct increase awareness problem health status , increase motivation engage additional treatment , improve health status ) .</detailed_description>
