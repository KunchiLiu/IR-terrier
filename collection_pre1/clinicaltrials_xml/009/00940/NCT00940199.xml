	<brief_summary>Patients breast cancer schedule undergo sentinel lymph node mapping biopsy randomly assign one four treatment group : I : ( Standard Care WRAMC ) : Application L-M-X topical anesthetic cream 4 % breast within one hour sub-areaolar injection 4 ml 99mTc-sulfur colloid ( 1 mCi normal saline ) II . Sub-areolar injection 4 ml pH-adjusted 99mTc-sulfur colloid ( 1 mCi sodium bicarbonate ) III . Sub-areolar injection 4 ml pH-adjusted 99mTc-sulfur colloid ( 1 mCi 1 % Lidocaine ) IV . Sub-areolar injection 4 ml pH-adjusted 99mTc-sulfur colloid ( 1 mCi sodium bicarbonate + 1 % Lidocaine ) The primary study outcome pain , evaluate study group , radiocolloid injection utilize standardize 10-point Likert scale , Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale , McGill Pain Questionnaire . Physician appraisal patient pain ( Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale ) estimate radiocolloid injection compare patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Null hypothesis : There difference overall pain intensity standard pH adjust radiocolloid patient undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping biopsy breast cancer . Objectives scientific aim : To compare intensity pain ( Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale + McGill Pain Questionnaire ) associate WRAMC 's current standard pH-adjusted radiocolloid patient undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping biopsy breast cancer . To assess objectively physician appraisal patient pain radiocolloid injection compare physician interpret pain score patient report pain score . Define success rate intra-operative SLN identification study group .</detailed_description>
