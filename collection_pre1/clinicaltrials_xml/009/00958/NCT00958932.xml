	<detailed_description>Asthma affect 15 million people United States . Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , rank treatment-of-choice , safe highly efficacious control trial , adherence ICS medication real-world setting poor patient group , especially low-income minority patient experience morbidity asthma . Children adults asthma take less half prescribed ICS medication . One study find 44 % ICS prescription child asthma fill . Even effective medication little value take prescribed . Decreasing use ICS repeatedly link poor asthma control increase health care utilization . We conduct randomize , practical clinical trial test impact communication enhancement program parent 3-12 year old child asthma large health maintenance organization ( HMO ) within Colorado . Research set significant advantage establish utility behavior-changing strategy , time demonstrate strategy apply large healthcare system sustain time . The propose intervention refer Telecommunication Enhanced Adherence Management ( TEAM ) program . This proposal build upon ongoing effort within Kaiser Permanente Colorado ( KPCO ) , participate HMO , use automate telecommunication technology prevent diabetes , reduce cardiac risk , reduce calorie consumption , increase exercise adherence , introduction intervention increase adherence daily ICS therapy . Speech Recognition ( SR ) , telecommunication technology use trial , previously employ promote adherence population child treat asthma within large HMO . TEAM create theory-based enhanced communication program use SR support asthma care manager nurse . The Asthma Care Manager program already exist within KPCO , SR frequency quality communication parent expect improve significantly , result ICS medication refill , good persistence ICS use , improve asthma outcome . Through SR call , parent remind motivated importance continue daily use ICS medication , ask child 's recent asthma symptom , give opportunity receive call back asthma care manager place request medication refill .</detailed_description>
