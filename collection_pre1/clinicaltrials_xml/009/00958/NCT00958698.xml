	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Developing symptom management plan may help relieve symptom related cancer cancer treatment help improve quality life . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study two different symptom management program see well work compare usual care patient recurrent persistent ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Symptom Management Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve target symptom representation ( i.e. , decrease symptom severity , symptom-related distress , symptom consequence measure Symptom Representation Questionnaire [ SRQ ] ) patient recurrent persistent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Secondary - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve target symptom representation patient 4 week . - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve target symptom controllability patient 4 , 8 , 12 week . - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve indicator quality life ( QOL ) patient measure FACT-O CES-Depression inventory short form 4 , 8 , 12 week . - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve communication health care provider symptom , implementation new symptom management strategy ( health care provider recommend well patient-initiated change ) , perceive effectiveness strategy ( health care provider recommend well patient-initiated change ) patient 4 , 8 , 12 week . - Compare efficacy nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention improve patient-related barrier symptom management measure Symptom Management Barriers Questionnaire 4 , 8 , 12 week . Exploratory - Compare trajectory change overall symptom severity patient undergo nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention use monthly assessment explore potential long-term effect WRITE Symptoms© intervention . - Compare trajectory change QOL patient undergo nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention use monthly assessment explore potential long-term effect WRITE Symptoms© intervention . - Compare trajectory change symptom severity , distress , communication , implementation new strategy non-targeted symptom patient undergo nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© vs self-directed WRITE Symptoms© v usual care intervention use monthly assessment explore whether patient able generalize symptom management approach teach WRITE Symptoms© intervention non-targeted symptom . - Explore whether change symptom representation mediate change QOL patient 8 12 week . - Explore whether effect WRITE Symptoms© intervention primary secondary endpoint 8 12 week differ base follow patient characteristic assess baseline : age , education , ethnicity ; depression measure CES-D short form ; trait anxiety measure STAI ; optimism measure LOT-R ; social support measure ISEL ; symptom severity measure SRQ . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord race/ethnicity ( non-Hispanic white v Hispanic non-white ) . Patients randomize 1 3 intervention arm . - Arm I ( nurse-delivered intervention ) : Patients give password-protected access web-based message board communicate research nurse . The nurse lead patient WRITE Symptoms© intervention module comprise representational assessment ; explore concerns/misconceptions/gaps/confusions ; create condition conceptual change ; introduce new information , goal setting , development symptom management plan ; summary via asynchronous posting patient 's message board . Patients work 3 select symptom use nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms© intervention module approximately 4 week . Two week later , patient 's symptom management strategy desire make change evaluate additional interaction nurse via message board . The nurse encourage patient try new select strategy , continue effective strategy , work local health care provider ongoing process improve symptom management . Patients give access resource guide include self-care guide 26 symptom . They encourage use process teach 3 select symptom symptom arise course intervention . - Arm II ( self-directed intervention ) : Patients give password-protected access interactive web-based computer program lead modify WRITE Symptoms© intervention module ( comprise element arm I ) without guidance individualize recommendation nurse . Patients work 3 select symptom use WRITE Symptoms© intervention module approximately 4 week . Two week later , patient prompt computer program respond question symptom management strategy desire make change . The program generate encouragement patient try new select strategy , continue effective strategy , continue new approach symptom management local health care provider ongoing process improve symptom management . Patients give access resource guide include self-care guide 26 symptom . They encourage use process teach 3 select symptom symptom arise course intervention . - Arm III ( usual care ) : Patients give password-protected access online questionnaire . Patients prompt monthly complete online questionnaire . Patients receive standard symptom management local health care provider . In arm , patient complete online questionnaire assess outcome measure baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 week , every 4 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
