	<brief_summary>This study investigate additional benefit light ion therapy add treatment antidepressant ( fluoxetine ) subject major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , versus treatment fluoxetine alone . Outcomes include depressive symptom rating scale measure quality life , work absence productivity , use health care service . The primary hypothesis , patient nonseasonal major depressive disorder ( MDD ) least moderate severity : 1 ) bright light therapy negative ion therapy superior placebo condition reduce symptom depression , 2 ) combination fluoxetine either bright light negative ion therapy effective either monotherapy condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale Many effective treatment exist depression , include psychotherapy antidepressant medication . However , antidepressant always effective , produce significant side effect pose risk overdose . Medication also expensive , thereby limit accessibility . Furthermore , many people MDD prefer use non-pharmacological treatment . Some study find combination antidepressant psychotherapy effective either monotherapy people chronic form MDD . However , evidence-based psychotherapy cognitive-behavioural therapy widely available within Canadian health care system . For reason , great interest find alternative treatment antidepressant psychotherapy . Bright light therapy , well establish effective treatment seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , many attribute make highly attractive use nonseasonal MDD : safe , well-tolerated , inexpensive , easy use , non-pharmacological treatment use monotherapy combine medication without worry drug-drug interaction . The `` gold standard '' method apply light therapy via 10,000 lux white fluorescent light box 30 minute day , usually early morning upon arise bed . The mechanism action light therapy still unknown , major hypothesis involve resynchronizing circadian rhythm and/or restore neurotransmitter dysfunction . Bright light predictable phase-shifting effect circadian rhythm human , study light therapy consistently demonstrate correlation phase shift antidepressant response . Although study do patient SAD , considerable evidence nonseasonal MDD also associate disturbance circadian rhythm . Other study show rapidly deplete serotonin catecholamine reverse antidepressant effect light therapy SAD , thereby demonstrate monoaminergic effect bright light similar see antidepressant . These chronobiologic monoaminergic effect bright light provide rationale use light therapy nonseasonal MDD . As well , initial study show negative ion generator may effective treatment neurovegetative symptom SAD , specifically oversleep , overeat , fatigability . However , relatively study conduct light ion therapy nonseasonal MDD . Several systematic review light ion therapy nonseasonal MDD show support efficacy , base limited number small-sample , poorly control RCTs . Research Method This study 8-week , multi-centre , double-blind ( subject rater ) , randomize , parallel-design trial ass efficacy light ion therapy combine fluoxetine treatment subject MDD , compare treatment fluoxetine alone . A total 216 depressed patient meet entry criterion enrol three-year period . Eligible patient randomize one four treatment condition entire treatment period ( 8 week ) : 1. light treatment use fluorescent light box ( 30 minute daily ) plus placebo pill every day ; 2. negative ion generator ( 30 minute daily ) plus 20 mg fluoxetine per day ; 3. negative ion generator ( 30 minute daily ) plus placebo pill every day ; 4. light treatment use fluorescent light box ( 30 minute daily ) plus 20 mg fluoxetine per day . Half device ( light box negative ion ) deactivate test placebo condition . Outcomes ( HAM-D ) primarily assess telephone raters blind treatment assignment . Other outcome measure assess patient-rated questionnaire administer Internet use secure web site , rating treat physician ( CGI Health Economics Assessment ) . Statistical Analysis All randomize subject least one follow-up visit include analysis base intent-to-treat . Ineligible subject inappropriately randomize exclude analysis . Missing data impute use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . For analysis treatment variable remain coded analyst investigator remain blinded variable identity analysis interpretation . The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint adjust mean change baseline endpoint ( 8 week ) HAM-D score use LOCF . All comparison analyze use ANCOVA adjust baseline value centre . The secondary outcome also analyze use similar analysis , appropriate . Post-hoc analysis also examine observed case data . Categorical data ( proportion sample adverse event ) analyze use chi-square test Fisher 's test cell size warrant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female outpatient age 1960 year . Patients meet DSMIV criterion major depressive disorder determine mood disorder section Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI , Sheehan et al , 1998 ) . A score 20 great Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HamD ) , indicate least moderately severe depression . Competency give inform consent . Pregnant woman , lactate woman sexually active woman childbearing potential use medically accept mean contraception . Serious suicidal risk judge clinician MINI . The following DSMIV diagnosis ( ensure homogeneous diagnostic group ) : organic mental disorder ; substance abuse/dependence , include alcohol , active within last year ; schizophrenia , paranoid , delusional disorder ; psychotic disorder ; panic disorder generalize anxiety disorder , primary diagnosis ; obsessivecompulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder ; bipolar disorder ; bulimia nervosa anorexia nervosa . Serious illness include cardiac , hepatic , renal , respiratory , endocrinologic , neurologic hematologic disease stabilize , past history convulsion . Any retinal disease systemic illness active retinal involvement ( e.g . diabetes ) precludes use bright light . Patients history severe allergy multiple drug adverse reaction . Regular current use psychotropic drug , include lithium tryptophan . Patients treat beta block drug . Hypertensive patient treated guanethidine , reserpine , clonidine methyldopa ( possible moodaltering effect drug ) . Use monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 day Visit 1 ( ensure drug interaction fluoxetine MAOIs ) , use heterocyclic antidepressant within 7 day Visit 1 ( ensure adequate washout period two week stop previous drug start treatment Visit 2 ) . Previous use fluoxetine light therapy . Treatment resistance current episode , define failure ( lack clinically significant response ) two antidepressant give therapeutic dos least 6 week . Patients start formal psychotherapy ( e.g . cognitivebehavioural interpersonal psychotherapy ) within 3 month Visit 1 , plan initiate psychotherapy study . Patients involved form treatment depression .</criteria>
