	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid ( TXA ) Versus Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid ( EACA ) Versus Placebo Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design The study design prospective , randomize , double-blinded control trial . The patient , researcher , surgeon , anesthesiologist blind patient 's treatment . Patients either receive TXA , EACA , normal saline . The study determine compare difference blood loss intra-operatively estimate blood loss postoperatively monitoring subfascial Hemovac drain output incision site three group . Postoperatively , laboratory value , drain output , clinical outcome carefully follow . The primary goal study compare efficacy TXA EACA placebo patient undergo corrective spinal surgery adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) , neuromuscular scoliosis ( NMS ) , adult deformity ( AD ) . Outcome measure include intra-operative perioperative blood loss , transfusion rate , complete blood count , coagulation profile , well postoperative wound drainage , complication , length stay . Standardized treatment protocol For EACA , load dose 100mg/kg infused 15 minute , maintenance dose 10mg/kg hr . For TXA , load dose 10mg/kg infused 15 minute , maintenance dose 1/mg/kg hr . Since TXA prepare pharmacy concentration ten time le concentration EACA , volume medication administer loading maintenance phase identical . This ideal method physician blind discuss depth anesthesia department . The dose regimen also accordance exist guideline current literature . The literature also report safely use TXA 100mg/kg load dose follow 10mg/kg hr maintenance dose . However , improve efficacy high dose TXA proven single orthopedic study . Since TXA report ten time potent EACA , deliver dose TXA ten time small EACA valid well supported literature . Surgical correction spine Dorsal lumbar access achieve posterior lumbar skin incision along midline . Paravertebral muscle dissect away bony structure take care achieve adequate hemostasis . Multi-level spinal osteotomy and/or release bony ligamentous structure perform increase mobility spinal column . Bone graft consist autologous bone allograft fill allow bony fusion spinal column limit motion . Pedicle screw place segmentally vertebral body provide adequate fixation rod instrumentation . Stainless steel , titanium , cobalt rod place help correct stabilize spine fusion occur . Generally great blood loss occur dissection placement pedicle screw rod placement associate less blood loss . Subfascial Hemovac Jackson-Pratt drain place wound site closure allow adequate drainage determination post-operative blood loss . Investigation schedule follow-up Data collect pre-operatively regard individual patient demographic , laboratory value , surgical procedure perform . Intra-operatively , data gather estimate blood loss account change fluid balance . Anesthesiologists ask maintain MAP 60 surgical exposure anchor placement MAP 70-90 surgical correction . Similarly , surgeon ask place subfascial Hemovac drain incision site . These standard practice . Postoperatively , laboratory value , drain output , clinical outcome carefully follow patient discharged . Given increase risk renal failure use Aprotinin change BUN CR ratio carefully monitor post-operatively . This data record onto de-identified data collection sheet researcher . These patient data sheet enter onto protect electronic database , data sheet store back-up study complete . Once complete database analyze summarize , result present involved participant without identifiable patient information . Statistical consideration While useful , analysis limit great variability study design control group prior orthopedic study . Since orthopedic study compare TXA EACA together , conduct power analysis require pool data two three study . This prove difficult , control group dissimilar study . Power analysis perform multiple time use data several study . When estimate sample size require compare TXA EACA , attempt make choose two study similar intra-operative blood loss within control group . A cardiac study , albeit dissimilar sample variance , also use estimate sample size need study . Finally , determine sample size outcome total blood loss transfusion requirement prove difficult even few study report outcome . Blood loss estimate operation room , also calculate take account patient body mass , pre/postoperative hematocrit , relative fluid balance . This minimize variance report blood loss . A power analysis perform 60 patient AIS , NMS , AD enrol study . With single institution surgeon anesthesiologists participate study , expect small variation operative blood loss report prior study . Data analyze patient collectively , also stratify diagnosis ( AIS , NMS , AD ) . The purpose stratify group threefold . First , separation diagnosis allow diligent control patient-related factor may affect blood loss transfusion rate . Secondarily , stratification diagnosis allow well understanding patient benefit one treatment option another . Lastly , allow broad application result study patient AIS , spinal deformity patient . An analysis variance , univariate , multivariate logistic regression analysis use analyze difference outcome . Odds ratio calculate regard risk autologous allogenic transfusion intra postoperatively . P-values calculate regard relative blood loss intra postoperative period well . The group analyze characterize homogeneity pre-operative characteristic may influence blood loss . Patients AIS , NMS AD stratify primary diagnosis analyze separately also collectively account patient surgery-related confounders . Non-continuous data analyze non-parametric test . Pre-operative curve characteristic include Cobb angle number vertebra fuse categorized ensure similar group comparison .</detailed_description>
