	<brief_summary>1 . To establish retrospective compilation clinical , histopathological , treatment follow-up ( clinic pathological ) data previous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) case . 2 . To establish prospective collection clinic pathological information NSCLC patient correspond blood tissue sample 3 . To discover validate molecular biomarkers survival treatment outcome NSCLC One current difficulty management lung cancer decision treat type treatment select . Thus need additional prognostic ( indicative disease aggressiveness ) predictive ( indicative likely response treatment ) marker lung cancer . To conduct successful prognostic predictive marker program , several factor require , include : comprehensive database link clinical , histopathological , treatment outcome characteristic case , collection sample link database suitable test candidate marker , multi-disciplinary , interdepartmental level expertise management lung cancer . Objective 1 : A review case record conduct extract clinical , treatment follow-up data Objective 2 : Patients age 21 year newly diagnose , untreated non-small cell lung cancer shall approach consent . Patients identified pathology record , study investigator ' clinic . After subject consent , baseline characteristic obtain . Follow data therapy receive toxicity encounter obtain . Tumor sample obtain patient NSCLC undergo surgery part routine clinical care . The surgical specimen send Pathology verify adequacy diagnostic sample per usual practice . Blood collect baseline ( prior anti-cancer treatment ) sample time relapse disease progression . Collection entail draw 7ml blood Vacutainer CPT tube ( Becton Dickinson , USA ) , centrifugation , extraction separate layer mononuclear cell ( MNC ) , label follow storage -80oC . The frequency blood drawn 1-5 time ( 7-35mls total ) . The number time depend whether lung cancer relapse advanced stage , often lung cancer relapse treatment . DNA RNA extract CSIS store freezer space . Stored sample use investigation prognostic predictive marker outcome discovery novel molecular alteration Objective 3 : Biomarker analysis tumor blood . Blood enrich circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) use previously optimize method ( 11 ) DNA extract CTC tumor use Tri-Reagent ( Molecular Research Center , Cincinatti , OH ) . DNA extract tumor , CTC mononucleated cell test somatic lung mutation sequence ( 2 ) . Germline DNA analyse gene link genetic risk NSCLC , treatment toxicity , gene relate NSCLC chemotherapy metabolic pathway . Tissue microarray ( TMA ) high-throughput method analyse large number formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor minimal cost effort . To analyse expression protein putative relevance EGFR function , cell proliferation , angiogenesis , apoptosis , metastasis , hormonal , TMA utilise . PTEN C/EBPa also analyse .</brief_summary>
