	<brief_title>Vorinostat Patients With Primary Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate treatment dose-adjusted Vorinostat schedule subject cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) receive prior systematic therapy treat single agent targretin ( bexarotene ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability dose-adjusted Vorinostat schedule administer patient primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma receive prior systematic therapy treat single agent targretin . II . To determine time objective response subject CTCL treat dose-adjusted schedule Vorinostat primary therapy . III To determine duration objective response subject CTCL . IV . To determine time loss objective response . V. To determine objective response rate extracutaneous manifestation CTCL ( lymph node enlargement , Sezary cell peripheral blood ) . VI . To compare efficacy , toxicity tolerability dose-adjusted schedule currently recommend flat dose Vorinostat subject CTCL . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm accord age ( &lt; 65 v &gt; = 65 year old ) . COHORT I ( &gt; = 65 year old ) : Patients receive 200 mg vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II ( &lt; 65 year old ) : Patients receive 400 mg vorinostat PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
