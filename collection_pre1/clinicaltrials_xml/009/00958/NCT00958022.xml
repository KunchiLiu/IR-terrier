	<brief_summary>The subject ask take part Phase I Phase II portion research study new investigational drug , LBH589 , combination chemotherapeutic agent , carboplatin etoposide . LBH589 ( make Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. ) consider `` investigational '' approve commercial use treatment cancer U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Etoposide carboplatin chemotherapeutic agent approve FDA treatment small cell lung cancer . LBH589 drug may slow growth cancer cell kill cancer cell block certain enzyme ( protein produce cell ) . LBH589 show effect cancer laboratory study study use animal ; however , know medicine show activity human . As May 2006 , approximately 100 patient receive treatment either intravenous capsule form LBH589 . Only capsule form LBH589 use study . The main goal Phase I portion research study find high safest dose LBH589 give combination carboplatin etoposide subject lung cancer without cause severe side effect . The main goal Phase II portion study find subject 's lung cancer respond LBH589 combination carboplatin etoposide high safe dose give Phase I . The subject may enrol either Phase I Phase II trial , depend enter study , enrol phase . This study also investigate subject 's body process combination LBH589 carboplatin etoposide . To determine , investigator measure amount study drug subject 's blood . This do series blood test , call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . Pharmacokinetics study study drug move body . Other purpose study sample subject 's genetic material ( DNA/RNA ) well determine biomarkers blood . ( For cancer , biomarkers way measure extent disease effect treatment . ) These sample also store future study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment plan - LBH589 give oral formulation start dose 10 mg ( Dose Level 1 ) three time per week ( dos give least 2 day apart , e.g . Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) , 2 3 week dose schedule . - After establish MTD LBH589 2 3 week dose schedule , 3 3 week dose schedule test dose , schedule adopt absence limit toxicity . - Carboplatin give day 1 , every 21 day , etoposide day 1,2,3 every 21 day 6 cycle . LBH589 continue weekly , three times-a-week , without interruption completion 6 cycle combination chemotherapy progression , intolerable toxicity . In phase I part cycle 1 , purpose PK study LBH589 start week prior first carboplatin/etoposide cycle PD study perform ( week -1 ) . Study design sample size : This phase I/II study . Phase I : 15-24 patient ( estimate ; Three six patient enrol dose level ) ; Phase II : 39 patient .</detailed_description>
