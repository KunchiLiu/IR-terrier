	<brief_summary>Endorphins release response breathe difficulty modify perception breathlessness . In randomized placebo-controlled trial , resistive breathing load use provoke breathlessness patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The hypothesis study intravenous ( IV ) administration naloxone , medication block endorphin activity , increase perception breathlessness experience patient breathe resistance device , compare IV administration normal saline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Endorphins Perception Dyspnea With Resistive Loading Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled investigation compare intravenous administration : - normal saline , consider placebo , expect effect patient rating dyspnea . - naloxone , opioid receptor antagonist penetration central nervous system block effect beta-endorphins , expect increase rating dyspnea patient COPD . Dyspnea induce resistive load breathe minimum 10 minute . Subjects : Twenty subject COPD recruit outpatient clinic Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center . Procedures : There three visit 2 - 3 day apart . Visit 1 The purpose Visit 1 : - ensure patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion - collect baseline data - familiarize patient study protocol - practice breathe resistive load system Visit 2 ( 2 - 3 day Visit 1 ) Patients perform pulmonary function test inhale 2 puff ( 180 mcg ) albuterol metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) order provide standardize bronchodilatation prior resistance breathing . Thirty minute later , pulmonary function test repeat measure response . Next , patient randomize one two blind study medication . 1. normal saline ( 25 ml volume ) intravenous infusion give 5 minute resistive breathe 2. naloxone ( 10mg 25 ml total volume ) intravenous push give 5 minute prior resistive breathe An 18-20 gauge catheter insert arm vein use draw blood administration either normal saline naloxone . In seated position , patient breathe quietly mouth piece without resistance . After 5 minute , 10 ml venous blood remove measurement baseline plasma beta-endorphin immunoreactivity . Then , physician give normal saline naloxone solution intravenously tube connect catheter . Five minute infusion give , resistance load ( obtain Visit 1 ) add inspiratory side two-way valve . The patient instruct continue breathe resistance `` long possible . '' At one minute interval , patient ask place mark vertical visual analog scale ( VAS ) order rate separately intensity unpleasantness dyspnea . When patient longer able breathe resistance system , patient ask make final rating intensity unpleasantness dyspnea . Thereafter , resistance breathing stop , mouthpiece remove patient . Next , 10ml venous blood remove measurement plasma beta-endorphin immunoreactivity . A third 10 ml aliquot venous blood take 30 minute completion resistive breathing session . During 5 minute breathe normally rest resistance breathing , follow non-invasive measurement make : inspiratory mouth pressure ( Pm ) ; expire gas analyze breath-by-breath minute ventilation ( VE ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) use metabolic measurement system ( MedGraphics ) ; oxygen saturation record use pulse oximeter ; end-tidal partial pressure CO2 . Visit 3 At Visit 3 , procedure use described Visit 2 , except patient randomize alternative blind study medication he/she receive Visit 2 .</detailed_description>
