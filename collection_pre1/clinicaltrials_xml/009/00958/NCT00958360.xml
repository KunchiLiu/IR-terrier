	<brief_title>Low Vision Intervention Trial II ( LOVIT II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Key Questions : The purpose propose single-masked multicenter randomize control trial determine Interdisciplinary Team approach low vision service delivery effective Basic Low Vision Service improve visual reading ability 330 veteran macular disease best correct visual acuity 20/50-20/200 . Effectiveness measure Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire ( VA LV VFQ-48 ) , valid reliable questionnaire administer telephone capture change patient ' self-report difficulty read perform daily living activity affect visual impairment rehabilitation . The primary outcome measure comparison change patient ' visual reading ability VA LV VFQ-48 receive low vision care Interdisciplinary Team Basic Low Vision Care program . The secondary outcome measure comparison change VA LV VFQ-48 visual ability score ( overall , mobility , visual information processing , visual motor skill ) . Hypothesis : The improvement visual reading ability measure VA LV VFQ-48 large patient receive low vision service Interdisciplinary Team patient receive Basic Low Vision Service . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) Compare mean change patient ' visual reading ability ( estimate patient ' difficulty rating read item VA LV VFQ-48 low vision service delivery ) Interdisciplinary Team Basic Low Vision Care Programs . ( 2 ) Compare mean change visual ability [ patient ' difficulty rating item VA LV VFQ-48 ( mobility , visual information processing , visual motor skill ) low vision service delivery ] Interdisciplinary Team Basic Low Vision Care programs. ( 3 ) . Identify characteristic patient benefit Interdisciplinary Team Basic Low Vision Service . ( 4 ) . Conduct economic evaluation compare cost cost effectiveness Interdisciplinary Team Basic Low Vision Service .</detailed_description>
