	<brief_summary>Overall Objective : To evaluate efficacy interventional walking program quality life functional status patient Lumbar Spinal Stenosis , post-surgery , use subjective ( VAS , ODI , RMDQ , SF-36 ) , objective measure ( triaxial accelerometry , step count , weight ) . Design Methods : Two group subject examine ; patient diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) progress surgical management , one group subject star walk program 2 month postop , group start walk program 3 month postop . Subjects agree participate assess ( assessment list ) diagnosis preoperatively 2 month postoperatively . One half group start walk program 2 month postop visit assess end walking program , half assess 3 month postop start walk program time assess 4 month postop . All subject contact phone walk program allow question subject offer support encouragement . Subjects give instruction daily diary track step take day ( appendix A ) . Subjects recruited referral practice Orthopedic Neurosurgery Spine Surgeons Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg . This encompass majority new currently manage case Manitoba Northwestern Ontario . Subjects age 18 90 . Male female subject recruit study . All LSS patient demonstrate intractable neurogenic claudication radiographically confirm lumbar spinal stenosis . Exclusion criterion previous lumbar spine surgery , existence significant co-morbidity ( e.g . neurologic cardiac condition , disease , etc . ) form , physical limitation ( musculoskeletal injury ) prevent subject participate regular activity walk program . Subjects participate require speak English .</brief_summary>
