	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) major health issue Canada ; affect 8 % population age 65 year . Persons AD reduce quality life become dependent others activity daily live ( ADLs ) . This problem loss independence - functional dependence - one focus grant application . It project 2020 , Canada well 10 million senior moderate severe functional dependence . Functional dependence significant contributor annual cost dementia already reach $ 4 billion 1990s . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) well-recognized risk factor AD functional dependence . Within broad assessment cognitive function , literature suggest executive function - ability concentrate , attend selectively , plan strategize - robust cognitive predictor functional status senior . Specifically , Royall colleague demonstrate executive function independently explain 43 % functional status community-dwelling senior dementia . The researcher investigate executive functioning senior MCI . Randomized trial various exercise intervention prove exercise many systemic benefit . Data emerge physical activity may improve cognition - specifically executive function - healthy adult . The researcher ' pilot data suggest resistance training senior may improve executive functioning assess neuropsychological test neuro-imaging . However , present Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews indicate insufficient publish data guide exercise prescription prevent AD . In person MCI , publish study report whether physical activity improve executive function , delay decline thus , prevent delay onset functional dependence ( later , dementia ) . Therefore , among senior MCI , researcher investigate whether specific exercise prescription : 1 ) provide absolute relative improvement cognitive function , particularly executive function ; 2 ) help maintain functional independence . This facilitate development effective exercise-based strategy prevention cognitive functional decline large population senior MCI - people greatly increase risk AD . The researcher ' propose research aim ascertain whether six-month , twice-weekly aerobic training ( AT ) program six-month , twice-weekly resistance training ( RT ) program , compare six-month , twice-weekly stretch &amp; relax ( S &amp; R ; control ) program , significantly improve cognition functional status community-dwelling woman MCI age 70 year old . Primary Hypothesis : At end six-month randomized trial , compare S &amp; R program , AT RT program significantly improve cognitive performance , assess neuropsychological testing . Secondary Hypotheses : At end six-month randomized trial , compare S &amp; R program , participant AT RT program : 1 . Demonstrate evidence cortical plasticity fMRI , increase activation cortical region responsible item relational memory ; 2 . Will significantly improve everyday problem solve ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EXCEL : Exercise Cognition Everyday Living Seniors With Memory Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN , TRIAL PROFILE , AND TIMELINE To achieve research objective , conduct six-month , single-blinded ( assessor ) , randomize trial . 75 community-dwelling old woman MCI randomly assign one three experimental group : 1 ) RT ; 2 ) AT ; 3 ) S &amp; R ( Control ) . The study sample restrict woman magnitude response cognition exercise differs sex . METHODS Recruitment We recruit senior interested study exercise cognition medium newspaper ad , flyer , poster community senior centre . Interested individual screen . The screening session include follow : 1 ) MMSE ; 2 ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) ; 4 ) Lawton Brody Instrumental Activities Daily Living Scale . Individual meet inclusion criterion invite join research study . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Community-dwelling senior woman female male ratio dementia 2:1 ; 2 . Aged 70 year old ; 3 . Subjective memory complaint determine interview ; 4 . MMSE score &gt; 24 ; 5 . Scored &lt; 26 MoCA ; 6 . Visual acuity least 20/40 , without corrective lens ; 7 . Physician approval participation exercise program . Exclusion Criteria 1 ) Diagnosed neurodegenerative disease ( e.g. , AD ) stroke ; 2 ) Have clinically significant peripheral neuropathy severe musculoskeletal joint disease ; 3 ) Diagnosed psychiatric condition ; 4 ) Previously diagnose dementia type ; Measurements We extensive experience use follow method instrument . All measure , unless otherwise indicate , assessed measurement session . General Screen Descriptors ( 90 min ) 1 . General Health Socioeconomic Status : General health socioeconomic status ascertain questionnaire . 2 . Global Cognitive Function Depression : Global cognitive function assess use MMSE . The Beck 's Depression Inventory ( BDI ) administer . MCI Screen : There consensus criterion clinical classification MCI . The MoCA use screen participant MCI . The MoCA brief screen tool MCI high sensitivity specificity . It 30-point test cover eight cognitive domain score 26 consider abnormal . A bonus point give less 12 year education . 3 . Physical Activity Level : Physical activity , include study-assigned exercise class , determine baseline throughout six-month study period . We administer valid reliable Physical Activities Scale Elderly ( PASE ) questionnaire monthly . Designed age 65 year old , participant use 12-item scale self-report average number hour per day spend participate leisure , household , occupational physical activity previous seven-day period . 4 . IADLs : Participants complete Lawton Brody Instrumental Activities Daily Living Scale screen impair IADLs . This scale subjectively assess ability telephone , shopping , food preparation , housekeeping , laundry , mode transportation , responsibility medication , ability handle finance . Cognitive Performance Measures : Memory : We assess item relational memory use computerized paradigm . We also assess spatial memory work memory ( i.e. , N-1 back ) use computer paradigm . In computer paradigm , record reaction time accuracy . We use RAVLT ass verbal memory . Executive Functions : We assess three executive function : 1 ) set shift use Trail Making Test ( Part B ) computerize paradigm dual-task ; 2 ) updating ( i.e. , work memory ) use verbal digit backward test computerized paradigm N-back ; 3 ) response inhibition use Stroop Colour-Word Test . Cortical Activation ( 60 min ) : To accurately assess effect AT RT cortical plasticity , collect pre- post-intervention fMRI data participant ( i.e. , AT , RT , S &amp; R ) . Muscular Strength : We assess dominant quadriceps ( isometric ) strength strain gauge near 0.5 kilogram . Six-Minute Walk ( 6 MWT ) : This walk test physical status ass general cardiovascular capacity senior 19 . The total distance walk meter six minute record . Balance Mobility : General balance mobility assess National Institute Aging ( NIA ) Balance Scale . Everyday Problem Solving Ability assess use Everyday Problems Test ( EPT ) . The EPT research assessment tool measure adult ' ability solve task daily live involve print material . The focus measure assess adult ' cognitive competence reason solve problem associate daily live . Randomization After baseline measurement , participant randomize computer generate random draw one three experimental group ( AT , RT , S &amp; R ) use www.randomization.com . Exercise Programs Resistance Training : The protocol RT program progressive high-intensity aim increase muscle strength extremities trunk . Both KeiserÂ® Pressurized Air system ( Keiser Corp.CA , US ) free weight use provide train stimulus . Participants undergo two-week familiarisation period equipment exercise . The exercise consist biceps curl , triceps extension , seat row , latissimus dorsi pull down , mini-squats , mini-lunges , hamstring curl , calf raise . The intensity training stimulus initially 50 % 60 % 1 repetition maximum ( RM ) determine week two , work range two set 10-15 repetition progress 75 % 85 % 1RM work range six eight repetition ( two set ) week four . The training stimulus increase use 7RM method , two set 6-8 repetition complete proper form without discomfort . Squats lunge perform initially body weight ; load increase proper form maintain two set 10 repetition . The number set complete load lift exercise record participant every class . Cardiovascular Training : The AT program outdoor walk program . We use three technique monitor exercise intensity . Each participant : 1 ) wear heart rate monitor ask work 65 % 80 % age specific target heart rate ; 2 ) subjectively monitor intensity workout use Rating Perceived Exertion . Stretch Relax ( Control ) : The S &amp; R program consist stretch exercise , deep breathing , relaxation technique . There evidence exercise improve cognitive function . This group serve control confound variable physical training receive travel community centre twice-weekly class , social interaction , change lifestyle secondary study participation .</detailed_description>
