	<brief_title>Study Bortezomib Combination With Cyclophosphamide Rituximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bortezomib design block protein play role cell function growth . This may cause cancer cell die . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug preferably central venous catheter ( CVC ) leave place entire time receive study drug . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . You sign separate consent form procedure , describe procedure risk detail . You receive rituximab vein 6 hour Day 1 every 21-day study cycle . You receive bortezomib vein 3 5 second , receive rituximab Day 1 every cycle . You also receive bortezomib Days 4 , 8 , 11 every cycle . You receive cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour 2 time day ( 6 hour total day ) Days 2 , 3 , 4 every cycle . On day , also receive mesna vein non-stop . Mesna drug protect bladder damage chemotherapy drug . It use decrease risk bleed bladder . You receive G-CSF ( filgrastim - drug use help build white blood cell count prevent infection ) injection skin start 24-36 hour receive bortezomib . You receive filgrastim 1 time day white blood cell count recover . Study Visits : At study visit , ask feeling drug may take . Throughout study , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn 2-3 time week routine test . Within 2 day cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You complete questionnaire nervous system side effect . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . After every 2 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You chest x-ray CT scan check status disease . These scan may head , neck , chest , stomach , and/or pelvis . The CT scan Cycle 4 occur doctor think need . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - If doctor think need , ECHO multigated radionuclide angiography ( MUGA ) scan and/or ECG . You exam colon ( colonoscopy ) check status disease Cycle 2 . Biopsy sample ( 3-6 ) colon take exam check status disease . After Cycles 2 , 6 , and/or 8 , doctor think need , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . After Cycle 6 , take study disease `` complete remission '' ( disease disappear ) . Otherwise , may receive 2 cycle study treatment . If receive 2 cycle , colonoscopy do Cycle 2 show lymphoma , another colonoscopy Cycle 6 Cycle 8 check status disease . Biopsy sample ( 3-6 ) colon take exam check status disease . Length Study : You receive study drug 8 cycle ( 8 month ) . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur Cycle 8 , disease complete remission Cycle 6 . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish receiving study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You complete questionnaire nervous system side effect . - Your performance status record . - You chest x-ray CT scan check status disease . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - If doctor think need , ECHO MUGA scan and/or ECG . Follow-Up Visits : After finish receiving study drug , follow-up visit accord follow schedule : - Every 3 month Year 1 treatment . - Every 4 month Year 2 treatment - Every 6 month Years 3-4 treatment . - Every 12 month Year 4 treatment . At follow-up visit , follow test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You complete questionnaire nervous system side effect . - Your medical history record - Your performance status record . - Blood ( around 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You chest x-ray check status disease . - You CT scan head , neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available treatment various type lymphoma . The use drug combination investigational . Up 46 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
