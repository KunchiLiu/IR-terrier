	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) effective give 3 month 6 month treat patient colon cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy 3 month see well work compare give combination chemotherapy 6 month treat patient stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective - To assess whether 3-month modify FOLFOX 6 XELOX treatment inferior 6-month modify FOLFOX 6 XELOX treatment term disease free survival ( DFS ) patient radically resect stage III colon cancer . Secondary Objectives - To assess whether 3-month modify FOLFOX 6 ( 6 cycle ) XELOX ( 4 cycle ) treatment inferior 6-month modify FOLFOX 6 ( 12 cycle ) XELOX ( 8 cycle ) treatment term overall survival ( OS ) patient radically resect stage III colon cancer - To evaluate safety profile treatment group Tertiary Objectives - For patient sign specific informed consent , blood tumour tissue sample store , register , centralize data bank translational research project determine accord literature scientific knowledge time end inclusion . ( exploratory ) - An economic evaluation country level conduct alongside clinical evaluation . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center , T stage ( 1 2 v 3 v 4 ) , N stage ( 1 vs 2 ) , performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) , age ( &lt; 70 year vs ≥ 70 year ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive modify FOLFOX 6 comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course ( 3 month ) . - Arm II : Patients receive modify FOLFOX 6 arm I . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course ( 6 month ) . Blood tumor sample may collect baseline pharmacogenetic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 8 year .</detailed_description>
