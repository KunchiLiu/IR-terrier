	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether rebreathing short time ( bit like breathe paper bag ) stimulate faster breathe thus make give Oxygen effective . The hypothesis investigator method ( rebreathing ) faster current method administer Oxygen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Method Preoxygenation Using Bain Circuit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It standard practice patient breathe oxygen receive general anaesthetic . This call preoxygenation . It do use mask fit snugly onto face . But long patient breathe oxygen ? Is take deep breath good idea ? What best oxygen flow rate ? These question important preoxygenation one thing make anaesthesia safe , find best way might help save life . Previous research attempt identify best way give oxygen anaesthesia . It seem breathing pure oxygen three minute enough , urgent situation , take deep breath pure oxygen minute . However , another possible way yet look . Asking someone breathe back air exhale seem , face , pointless best . But short time make person breathe harder . Then give pure oxygen , breathe really deeply might make preoxygenation quicker . That 's theory . To test plan ask 40 healthy people standard preoxygenation , try new way . We wo n't give anaesthetic , oxygen . The hypothesis new method quicker exist one .</detailed_description>
