	<brief_summary>Background : - For every CHI research study , patient must fulfill list criterion , base primarily medical condition . To determine whether patient meet eligibility criterion participate research protocol , researcher must perform series diagnostic test procedure . - These evaluation design evaluate participant general medical condition ( i.e. , blood test , function certain organ lung , heart , liver , kidney ) , confirm diagnosis ensure healthy volunteer good condition . They maximize safety patient healthy volunteer CHI . Objective : - To determine eligibility patient healthy volunteer active CHI research protocol . Eligibility : - The procedure include protocol determine eligibility active CHI research protocol . - Both healthy volunteer patient evaluate . Design : - Required test procedures various research study may include follow : history physical examination , blood urine test , lung heart function test ( echocardiogram , electrocardiogram , stress test ) , image study ( X-rays , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , computerize tomography ( CT ) , tissue collection . - Participants ask undergo test study study consider . The research team provide information additional test may require . - After eligibility assessment complete , participant may offer participation one CHI research protocol refer back home physician .</brief_summary>
