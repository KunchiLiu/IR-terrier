	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label , multi-center Phase III study evaluate efficacy safety lapatinib combination trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone continue HER2 suppression therapy woman HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Eligible subject complete 12 24 week first- second-line treatment trastuzumab plus chemotherapy , experience either complete disappearance metastatic lesion , persistence metastatic disease ( stable disease ) without unequivocal progression occurrence new lesion , indicate continue receive trastuzumab alone maintenance therapy . Eligible subject enter LPT112515 study first-line treatment know history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ; subject enter study second-line treatment know history CNS metastases stable ( asymptomatic steroid ≥3 month ) CNS metastases . The primary objective study compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) subject HER2-positive MBC randomize receive treatment lapatinib plus trastuzumab versus randomize receive trastuzumab alone . The secondary objective include overall survival , clinical benefit response rate ( CR , PR SD ≥24 week ) qualitative quantitative adverse event profile 2 treatment arm . It estimate 280 subject ( 140 per group ) require observe 193 PFS event .</brief_summary>
