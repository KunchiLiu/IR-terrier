	<brief_title>Hyperthermic Intraoperative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Recurrent Ovarian Cancer - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease Background : Between 1997 2001 incidence ovarian cancer Switzerland 15.8 per 100'000 woman rank fifth among cancer incidence woman . Nearly half patient die disease lead mortality rate 7.7 per 100'000 . Together pancreatic cancer , ovarian cancer rank fifth among cancer relate death woman . The common form ovarian cancer epithelial ovarian cancer incidence 91.1 % . Thus , follow term ovarian cancer refer solely malignant epithelial ovarian cancer ( 78.6 % ovarian cancer ) exclude borderline low malignancy epithelial ovarian tumor ( 12.5 % ) . Early stage disease ( FIGO I - IIA ) show practically symptom , thus 80 % ovarian cancer diagnose later stage ( FIGO IIB - IV ) , main reason high mortality . Treatment stag surgical removal visible resectable tumor nodule , ovary , uterus , omentum , pelvic paraaortic lymph node , advance stage tumor infest organ organ part remove ( =cytoreduction debulking ) . Survival time strongly depend completeness cytoreduction . Surgery follow chemotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel carboplatin alone ( except low risk FIGO stage IA , G1 ) . Published survival rate therapy vary considerably mainly dependent stage tumor remain tumor size ( tumor mass resect due proximity vital organ like major blood vessel ) . _____Stage______survival 5 year - FIGO I ... ... ..76 % - 93 % - FIGO II ... ... .60 % - 74 % - FIGO III ... ... 23 % - 41 % - FIGO IV ... ... ... .11 % ( J. S. Berek &amp; N. F. Hacker , Practical Gynecologic Oncology 3ed . Philadelphia : Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins , 2000 , 504 . ) Even optimal debulking adjuvant chemotherapy 55 % patient suffer recurrent ovarian cancer consider essentially incurable disease , since response rate secondary treatment 30 % median survival 60 week . Therapy background : Hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) Unless tumor already metastasize ( FIGO IV ) ovarian cancer tumor nodule restrict peritoneal cavity . Since standard chemotherapy apply intravenously cytotoxic drug reach cancer cell diffusion peritoneum via blood stream sometimes poor vascularisation tumor nodule . To improve exposure tumor cytotoxic drug clinical trial perform deliver chemotherapy directly peritoneum ( intraperitoneal chemotherapy ) . While type therapy show promise result , also serious drawback : permanent catheter implant , even distribution instillate difficult sometimes link considerable discomfort patient . Alternatively intraperitoneal chemotherapy apply directly cytoreductive surgery ( intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ) . Since peritoneum completely open , perfusate easily reach surface surgeon facilitate distribution gentle agitation hand . Since whole procedure perform surgery full anesthesia patient suffer additional discomfort . While intraperitoneal chemotherapy apply repeatedly like conventional chemotherapy , intraoperative chemotherapy perform . Thus , effectiveness treatment high possible . This achieve use high possible drug concentration increase temperature perfusate approximately 42°C ( hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ) . The rational hyperthermic treatment several fold . First , show tumor kill elevated temperature alone . Second , elevated temperature increase diffusion rate drug tumor thus drug penetrate deeper tumor nodule . Furthermore , elevate temperature increase cell membrane permeability thus uptake cytotoxic drug tumor cell . Finally , cytotoxic drug , like cisplatin , cytotoxicity increase 50 fold temperature increase 37°C 42°C tissue culture model . Rationale perform trial : Most study perform hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy dose cytotoxic drug accord body surface ( like 50 mg/m² cisplatin ) analogy systemic , intravenous chemotherapy ( usually use dose ) . Although seem correlation body surface blood volume , pharmacodynamics drug dose body surface still highly variable thus dose body surface increasingly consider controversial systemic administration . However , drug dose differently , e.g . carboplatin . For hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy dose body surface make even less sense , since aim high possible drug concentration peritoneum without undue local systemic toxicity . Furthermore , study use intraoperative chemotherapy vary volume perfusate accord size patient . Since amount cytotoxic drug already fix dose body surface ( amount [ mg ] = dose [ mg/m² ] x body surface [ m² ] ) effective concentration ( mg/l ) perfusate vary considerably patient . On hand pharmacokinetic analysis show reduce concentration cytotoxic drug perfusate reduces efficacy even amount drug remain . In study safety new dose regime evaluate . The concentration cisplatin perfusate hold constant independent body weight size achieve high effectiveness chemotherapy . However , amount cisplatin would exceed equivalent 62.5 mg/m² body surface , dose would base body surface ( 62.5 mg/m² ) safety reason . The primary endpoint safety treatment . All patient able receive full dose systemic carboplatin chemotherapy completion trial treatment . Treatment plan : Patients undergo cytoreductive surgery remove visible tumor nodule . After cytoreduction hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy perform . For 90 min 42°C warm cisplatin solution ( 25 mg/l ) perfuse peritoneum . Afterwards cisplatin remove repeatedly rinse peritoneum Ringer lactate solution . During whole procedure patient receive strong hydration accord predefined protocol . Cisplatin pharmacokinetics : The concentration platinum determine perfusate , plasma urine various time point . Various publish pharmacokinetic model cisplatin clearance test data obtain . Furthermore , want test whether pharmacokinetic parameter might correlate nephrotoxicity allow prediction nephrotoxic event . Translational research : Tumor tissue remove cytoreduction use various vitro experiment : - Histological examination infiltrate lymphocyte determination lymphocytes - Determine depth platinum infiltration treatment tumor nodules various condition cisplatin ( vitro ) - Analysis tumor cell biology chemotherapy heat treatment vitro ( protein phosphorylation , release second messenger )</detailed_description>
