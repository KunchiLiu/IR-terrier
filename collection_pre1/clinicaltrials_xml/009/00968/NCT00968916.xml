	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To determine maximum tolerate dose base incidence dose limit toxicity maximum administer dose AVE8062 administer every 3 week patient advance solid tumor . Secondary objective : - To assess overall safety profile drug . - To characterize pharmacokinetic profile AVE8062 active metabolite RPR 258063 . - To evaluate anti-tumor activity drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation , Safety Pharmacokinetic Study AVE8062 Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration study patient include 4-week screening phase , 21-day study treatment cycle , end treatment visit follow-up period .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Advanced solid tumor become refractory conventional treatment standard therapy exists . Patients sign dated Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve patient informed consent form ( ICF ) prior enrollment study . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &gt; = 2 . Life expectancy le 12 week . Concurrent treatment anticancer therapy , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , target therapy , gene therapy , patient plan receive treatment study . Absence histologically cytologically proven cancer . Male patient agree contraception . Absence negative serum/urinary pregnancy test within 7 day prior enrollment study female patient childbearing potential . Patients must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , use `` effective contraception '' ( definition `` effective contraception '' base judgment investigator ) . Washout period le 28 day prior antitumor therapy ( chemotherapy , target agent , immunotherapy radiotherapy ) investigational treatment , except nitrosoureas , mitomycin may use 42 day prior first cycle . No washout period require hormonal therapy , however , must discontinue first cycle . Not recover previous therapy ( radiation , surgery , medication ) . Adverse event relate previous therapy must National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria grade &lt; = 1 ( alopecia &lt; = grade 2 ) screening return subject 's baseline prior recent previous therapy . Symptomatic brain metastasis carcinomatous leptomeningitis . Other serious illness medical condition : Existence significant neurologic psychiatric disorder impair ability obtain consent . Active infection . Other serious illness control adequate treatment . Inadequate organ function include : Absolute neutrophils count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL ( without red blood cell transfusion 28 day prior test ) Calculated creatinin clearance &lt; 60 ml/min Total bilirubin &gt; = 1.5 mg/dL Alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 1.5 time upper normal limit institutional norm . Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) &gt; 2.5 time upper normal limit institutional norm . An increase AP grade 2 would accept increase relate presence bone metastasis . Bone specific isoenzyme AP great pathological limit define manufacturer sign bone metastasis . Documented medical history myocardial infarction , document angina pectoris , arrhythmia especially severe conduction disorder second third degree atrioventricular block , stroke , history arterial venous thromboembolism within past 180 day require anticoagulant . Patient leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % echocardiography . Patient baseline QTc interval &gt; 0.45 , family history Long QT Syndrome Patient uncontrolled hypertension patient organ damage relate hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy grade 2 ocular funduscopic change kidney impairment . Patient grow vessel disease ( eg agerelated macular degeneration , diabetic retinopathy , rheumatoid arthritis ) , ongoing wound heal process . Patient enrol study least 28 day surgery . 12lead Electrocardiogram : ST Twave change suggest ischemia Hypertension define systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg two repeat measurement 30 minute interval . Patient one episodes ventricular tachycardia 3 consecutive premature beat , frequency &gt; = 180 beats/min .</criteria>
