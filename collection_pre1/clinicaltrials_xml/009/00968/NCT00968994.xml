	<brief_summary>This randomize , control trial design evaluate split-thickness donor site treat exSALT SD7™ compare donor site treat Xeroform® . For purpose study , subject enrol select donor site portion donor site designate `` Test Sites . '' The select location randomly assign treatment either Test Dressing Control Dressing . The primary objective trial quantify proportion donor site group heal 10 14 day . Secondary objective include : time re-epithelialization , pain dressing change mobilization , ease use , resource utilization safety , well quality heal overall cosmetic result . A total 25 subject enrol trial . The trial duration 12 week . For purpose trial , heal define ≥ 90 % re-epithelialization must visually confirm investigator designate two people ( i.e. , research nurse , burn resident , member Wound Care Team ) . The maximum time evaluate heal 14 day +/-2 day . A final visit conduct 12 week safety evaluate quality healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autologous skin graft common procedure require care burn plastic surgery patient harvest autologous skin graft result creation partial thickness wind know donor site . The donor site healing time affect length hospitalization subject survival . The literature report use variety donor site dress material include fine mesh gauze , polyurethane film , synthetic fiber hydrocolloid ( Kilinc , Sensoz et al . 2001 ) . The literature report might consider optimal donor site dress attribute . These attribute would include : minimizing pain , velocity healing , minimize bacterial growth simplicity use ( Rakel , Bermel et al . 1998 ) . However , none available dressing product entirely satisfactory . Fine mesh gauze ( FMG ) donor site dress use many burn center , inexpensive , place posterior donor site , require margin intact skin allow large amount exudate drain away donor site . However , FMG inherent anti-infective property provide dry environment wound heal . Xeroform® Petrolatum Dressing resemble FMG physically except contains 3 % xeroform ( bismuth tribromophenate ) exert antibacterial effect ( Feldman , Rogers et al . 1991 ) . Xeroform® Petrolatum Dressing standard donor site dress Firefighters ' Burn Treatment Unit ( 3C2 WMC ) Plastic Surgery Unit ( 3D3 WMC ) select control treatment ( Control Dressing ) . Research evidence demonstrate partial thickness wound re-epithelialize rapidly moist environment free infection ( Alper 1986 ; Alvarez 1988 ) . In effort provide improve method dress wound donor site , exSALT SD7™ propose alternative dressing ( Test Dressing ) . The dressing intend reduce pain discomfort improve re-epithelialization process provide moist environment . The model outline protocol provide basis control comparison wound heal re-epithelialization clean partial thickness wound allow u compare heal rate quality Test Dressing compare standard care determine safety efficacy .</detailed_description>
