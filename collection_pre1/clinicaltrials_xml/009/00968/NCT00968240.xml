	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . This group tumor also exhibit aggressive behavior , result median overall survival duration 9-12 month GBM , 3-4 year AA . Initial therapy consist either surgical resection , external beam radiation . All patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) technique effectively increase concentration drug deliver brain spar body systemic side effect . One currently use drug call , Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) show active human brain tumor actual CNS penetration unknown . This phase I clinical research trial test hypothesis Bevacizumab safely use direct intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion dose 10mg/kg ultimately enhance survival patient relapsed/refractory GBM/AA . By achieve aim study determine toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose ( MTD SIACI Bevacizumab . We expect project provide important information regard utility SIACI Bevacizumab therapy malignant glioma , may alter way drug deliver patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Super-Selective Intraarterial Intracranial Infusion Avastin ( Bevacizumab )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care recur GBM patient receive Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) intravenously ( IV ) 10mg/kg CPT-11 ( Irinotecan ) every two week tumor grow 25 % . At point , patient deem treatment failure give another treatment . Because blood brain barrier ( BBB ) IV drug penetrate blood vessel wall well get brain , one know sure IV drug actually get brain infusion . Previous study show want increase penetration drug brain , intra-carotid artery ( intraarterial ) delivery superior standard intravenous delivery . Previous technique use intra arterial ( intracarotid ) infusion still non-selective drug delivery still go blood vessel brain , patient still significant adverse event , blindness . Newer techniques interventional neuroradiology allow selective delivery catheter higher arterial tree agent chemotherapy , deliver without risk adverse affect blindness . In fact , study Cornell MSKCC develop new excite super selective intraarterial delivery treatment Pediatric Eye Tumors little toxicity . Therefore , trial ask one simple question : Is safe delivery patient 's first dose Avastin intraarterially use super selective delivery technique instead standard intravenous route administration ? This increase amount drug get tumor also spare patient adverse effect less selective delivery . During single dose intraarterial Avastin , patient also receive dose mannitol open blood brain barrier improve delivery agent brain . After single dose Mannitol Avastin intraarterially , patient evaluate 4 week assess toxicity . If toxicity , patient go get standard chemotherapy ( Avastin CPT-11 ) every two week routine unless fail . After do `` experimental '' aspect protocol . This Phase I trial design test safety single dose intraarterial delivery Avastin Mannitol , prior start standard IV Avastin CPT-11 . In summary : Current Standard Care : Day 0 : Intravenous Avastin ( 10mg/kg ) CPT-11 Day 14 , 28 ( every two week thereafter ) : Intravenous Avastin CPT-11 Experimental portion proposal : Day 0 : Intraarterial Avastin single dose ( start 2mg/kg 10mg/kg ) Mannitol open blood brain barrier Day 28 ( every two week thereafter ) : Intravenous Avastin CPT-11 1 . Subjects first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 25 % ; 3-10 mL/s 30seconds ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand patient previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . 2 . To add single intraarterial delivery ( SIACI ) Avastin prior begin standard IV Avastin CPT-11 therapy patient recur relapse high grade glioma . After one cycle observation period ass toxicity IA infusion , subject receive Intravenous ( IV ) bevacizumab 10 mg/kg irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) 125mg/m2 every 14 day standard therapy relapse recur GBM . The dose escalation algorithm follow : We use single intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion Avastin , start dose 2mg/kg first three patient . Assuming dose limit toxicity first 28 day IA infusion , patient begin standard chemotherapy regimen Avastin CPT-11 every two week . The dos escalate 4,6,8 finally 10mg/kg Phase I trial . Inclusion criterion Include : Males female , ≥18 year age , document histologic diagnosis relapse refractory glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AOA ) . Both hematologic non-hematologic toxicity determine scored accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( version 3.0 ) . Monitoring conduct post procedure CT scan ( 6-12 hour post procedure ) , serial history , neurological physical examination together serial blood count , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) chemistry . MRI perform every two cycle approximately every two month . Response evaluate two cycle chemotherapy via MRI injection contrast . Subjects show objective response ( reduction tumor size ) stable disease 2 cycle treatment able continue study . Progressive disease require subject take research protocol . The following evaluated every cycle , follow-up : neurological examination , physical examination , performance status , laboratory parameter review adverse reaction . Contrast enhance MRI ( MRI gadolinium preferable imaging study except case MRI contraindicate i.e. , pacemaker metallic implant . In subject , CT contrast acceptable ) perform every two-treatment cycle research protocol . The following subject take protocol : progressive disease ; experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Follow-up continue disease progression death . Survival measure time first dose IA Avastin® ( give start treatment cycle ) . The patient responsible additional cost associate enrollment trial . All cost IA delivery submit patient 's insurance provider . WCMC name sponsor study cover cost experimental procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION Male female patient great equal18 year age . Patients document histologic diagnosis relapse refractory glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) Patients histologically confirm lowgrade brain tumor relapse enhance tumor MRI evaluate toxicity . Patients must least one confirm evaluable tumor site . *A confirm tumor site one biopsyproven . NOTE : Radiographic procedure ( e.g. , Gdenhanced MRI CT scan ) document exist lesion must perform within three week treatment research study . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % ( equivalent ECOG level 02 ) ( see Appendix A ; Performance Status Evaluation ) expect survival great equal three month .
