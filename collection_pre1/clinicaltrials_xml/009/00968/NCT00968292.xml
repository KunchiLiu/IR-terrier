	<detailed_description>The test unblinded randomized study subject 's current prosthetic foot K3 Promoter traumatic/congenital amputee dysvascular/diabetic amputee . Assessments make 30-day accommodation period foot prosthesis . In order randomize treatment factor habituation test site protocol , two cohort use . Half volunteer randomly assign fit K3 Promoter regular prosthetist continue wear current foot prothesis . Both cohort 30-day accommodation period . Subjects either cohort visit CGMA test . Volunteers use prosthesis 30 day . After second 30-day period , height weight record , test repeat . Because anticipated difficulty scheduling , volunteer give +3 day grace period 30 day-accommodation time .</detailed_description>
