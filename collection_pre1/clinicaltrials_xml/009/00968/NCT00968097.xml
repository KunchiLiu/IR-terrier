	<detailed_description>Background : Alzheimer 's dementia ( AD ) common disorder age brain cause progressive irreversible impairment memory cognitive function . Beginning initial description Alzheimer 's dementia ( AD ) 1906 abnormal accumulation plaque tangle brain woman severe cognitive impairment first note , pathophysiology AD intimately associate progressive neuropathologic process involve abnormal protein deposition brain . More recent work implicate accumulation β-amyloid early feature AD , may directly responsible clinical manifestation disease . Pathologic study suggest level β-amyloid elevate even case classify questionable dementia ( CDR score = 0.5 ) , increase amyloid strongly correlate cognitive decline . Increases β-amyloid precede significant tau pathology suggest formation plaque early disease may clinical importance . Until recently post-mortem examination brain tissue mean available directly evaluate change occur brain AD relate neurodegenerative disease . In last decade , development highly specific technique image brain AD expand ability measure process disease time live individual . Briefly , technique involve intravenous administration radioactively-labeled compound bind selective target site brain . The scintigraphic imaging method PET ( positron emission tomography ) SPECT ( single photon emission compute tomography ) able detect spatial distribution radioactive compound brain use objective , sensitive , accurate method quantify concentration target site different brain region . Using technique , β-amyloid aggregate successfully image several study AD patient use high affinity 11-C 18-F-labeled PET tracer ( PIB FDDNP , AV-1 ) . More recently , another tracer , base thioflavin-S derivative , 6-iodo-2- ( 4'-dimethylamino- ) phenyl-imidazol [ 1,2-a ] pyridine , IMPY , label 123-I used image amyloid . MNI-340 similar structure PIB , 123-I radioactive tag offer distinct advantage large-scale clinical imaging study β -amyloid plaque target treatment marker plaque burden efficacy therapeutic intervention . The long half-life ( 13.1 h ) 123-I permit image multiple subject single research-dedicated imaging center . This minimize variability introduce multicenter quantitative imaging trial different camera , image processing method , QA procedures conspire increase variance image biomarkers . Using model , group pioneer method evaluate loss dopamine function Parkinson 's disease use radioactive drug 123-I β-CIT , bind directly dopamine nerve terminal . The adaptation image agent like 123-I MNI-340 biomarker β-amyloid deposition AD patient assess disease require human validation study . The purpose study develop characterize 123-I MNI-340 objective biomarker AD . The significance work lie apply state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tool develop relevant biomarker live AD patient . In context propose investigate feasibility apply technique image biomarker disease AD patient . Research Plan : General Design Methods . The underlying goal study assess 123-I MNI-340 SPECT image tool detect ß-amyloid deposition brain AD research participant age- gender-matched healthy subject . All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 10 patient Alzheimers disease ( AD ) 10 similarly age healthy control recruit participate study . Healthy control screened ensure evidence cognitive decline significant neurological deficit . Informed consent obtain subject . All subject undergo screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects give bolus injection 123-I MNI-340 antecubital vein . Subjects undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I MNI-340 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 8 hour . The quantitative visual imaging analysis perform image-processing specialist remain blind clinical information.including diagnosis . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I MNI-340 . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result AD patient control compare .</detailed_description>
