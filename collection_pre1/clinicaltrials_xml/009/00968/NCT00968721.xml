	<brief_title>Decisional Influences Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) Patients ' Medication Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical research produce significant advance pharmacologic management inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Preliminary research , however , suggest patient non-adherence may blunt medication effectiveness . The etiology medication non-adherence likely depend several coexist factor . We believe naturalistic decision make link patient level/ `` micro '' variables services-level/ `` macro '' variable behavioral outcome . Every day , natural decision medication use likely make context patient ' experience illness , knowledge illness treatment , physician-patient relationship , personal priority value , influence relate decide use medicine . By nature , illness related decision uncertain risky outcome unknown patient often limited knowledge experience progression chronic illness . During progression illness , patient may experiment analyze risk benefit therapy rely interpersonal interaction health-care professional determine self-management strategy best suit patient life goal . Patient decision-making thus iterative process evolves time . An understanding medication use decision require description understand decision influence may affect medication use decision-making course illness . Therefore , primary purpose study develop test psychometric instrument ass influence patient ' decision use/not use IBD medication . The main hypothesis underlie instrument development project patient risk intentionally modify prescribe medication regimen differ influence decision-making , health status , utilization IBD clinic service compare intentionally adherent continue adherence time . The following question study : - What influence therapeutic value , task difficulty , physician-patient relationship , information source , personal belief value patient ' IBd medication adherence ? - What relationships decision influence illness activity ? - What association exist among decision influence , illness activity , medication adherence utilization IBD Clinic service ?</detailed_description>
