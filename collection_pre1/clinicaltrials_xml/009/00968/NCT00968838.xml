	<brief_title>A Study Leukemia Patients With Life-Threatening Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiated White Blood Cell Transfusions : White blood cell transfusion volunteer donor may contain blood cell body react produce disorder call transfusion-associated graft versus host disease . This mean injected white blood cell reproduce body react tissue create side effect . To avoid , blood radiate ( change radiation ) kill cell divide . But radiation also may destroy infection-fighting capacity white blood cell transfusion , may decrease effectiveness white blood cell transfusion . Radiating white blood cell standard procedure use treat serious , life-threatening infection . Non-Radiated White Blood Cell Transfusions : If white blood cell radiate , may increase effectiveness white cell transfusion . This may help white blood cell make infection-fighting white blood cell . But , cell also responsible transfusion-associated graft versus host disease kill . This increase risk could complication . Study Groups : If agree take part study , one first 40 patient , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You physician know result randomization . If Group 1 , non-radiated white blood cell transfusion . If Group 2 , standard white blood cell transfusion ( radiation ) . If less 50 year old , receive 4 transfusion radiate white cell . If continue show sign symptoms infection receive additional white cell transfusion base group randomize . If first 40 patient , place group study doctor think benefit . It important note study design `` adaptive randomization '' mean outcome individual observe , next patient receive product likely beneficial least likely harmful . White Blood Cell Transfusion : Before transfusion , nurse take temperature , breathe rate blood pressure . During transfusion nurse watch closely . Side effect sometimes occur soon transfusion . You may give drug help reduce side effect . If Group 2 , receive 4 standard white blood cell transfusion ( radiation ) . If still infection 4 transfusion doctor think necessary , additional transfusion . You continue transfusion doctor feel infection control . If experience graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , doctor 's discretion . If need white blood cell transfusion new infection infection come back , receive type transfusion receive . If discharge hospital doctor would like continue receive white blood cell transfusion , able receive outpatient . Each transfusion take 1 hour several hour depend tolerate treatment . Each transfusion give daily close daily possible . Before every infusion , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn measure number white blood cell blood . Length Study : You receive transfusion doctor feel infection control . This investigational study . White blood cell transfusion consider standard procedure treatment serious , life threaten infection . Up 150 patient take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
