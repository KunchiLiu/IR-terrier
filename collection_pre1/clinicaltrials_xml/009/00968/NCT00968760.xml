	<brief_summary>Sometimes researcher change DNA ( genetic material cell ) donate T cell ( white blood cell support immune system ) use process call `` gene transfer . '' Gene transfer involve draw blood patient , separate T-cells use machine . Researchers perform gene transfer change T-cells ' DNA , inject change T-cells body patient . The goal clinical research study learn investigational type gene transfer give reliably safely patient advance B-cell lymphoma . B cell type white blood cell fight infection disease . Lymphoma type cancer affect immune system , include B cell . The gene transfer involve draw blood , separate T cell ( white blood cell fight infection disease ) , change T cell ' DNA ( genetic material ) specific way , return change T cell back body . Researchers want learn high dose change T cell give safely . Researchers also want learn long change T cell remain participant 's body , change T cell reliably treat B-cell lymphoma . Finally , researcher want learn interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) help change T cell last long body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Plan : This study 3 step : chemotherapy , stem cell transplant , gene transfer . If disease relapse ( return ) study , may receive T-cell infusion without stem cell transplant . Your study doctor decide receive stem cell transplant . The chemotherapy combination study ( carmustine [ BiCNU® ] , cytarabine [ Cytosar-U® ] , etoposide [ Vepesid® ] , melphalan [ Alkeran® ] give try destroy remain tumor cell prepare body stem cell transplant and/or T-cell infusion . If receive T cell without transplant , may receive additional chemotherapy T cell infusion , doctor think need . Your treat doctor discus chemotherapy drug , may sign additional consent chemotherapy drug standard care . A stem cell transplant design help body attack cancer cell may remain chemotherapy . The gene transfer involve draw blood , separate T cell , change cell ' DNA laboratory , return genetically change cell back body . T cell type white blood cell fight infection . The type gene transfer use study design help T cell well fight B-cell lymphoma . These genetically change T cell design fight B-cell lymphoma target CD19 ( chemical `` marker '' find certain B-cell lymphoma cell ) . IL-2 ( Proleukin® ) design help T cell grow . In study , researcher want learn help genetically change T cell grow last long body . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level T cell , without IL-2 , base join study . The first group participant receive low dose T cell . Each new group receive high dose T cell group , intolerable side effect see . Up 4 dose combination T cell test . Tests Before Leukapheresis : Before 2 leukapheresis procedure ( describe ) , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw use routine test look diseases hepatitis HIV . - To check lung function , breathe test . A chest X-ray perform check infection . Leukapheresis # 1 Standard Blood Draw ( For Collecting T Cells ) You visit Apheresis Clinic MD Anderson leukapheresis perform . Leukapheresis procedure remove blood body order collect specific blood cell . The remain blood return body . Blood drawn needle vein one arm , pass machine , remain blood return back needle vein arm . The machine remove sample white blood cell . This process take 3 hour complete . Blood may also collect standard blood draw . Blood ( less 7 tablespoon ) contain circulate T cell draw 1-2 day use one needle stick arm . Your white blood cell sample send lab MD Anderson genetically modify T cell product make . The modified T cell grown lab . It take 7 week modify grow necessary number genetically modify T cell . If researcher unable create high enough dose T cell lab , take study . Placement Central Venous Catheter : Before second leukapheresis , receive central venous catheter . This sterile flexible tube place large vein upper chest , local anesthesia . The study investigator explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . When possible , drug need give vein give use catheter . You also receive T cell product catheter . Leukapheresis # 2 ( For Collecting Stem Cells ) patient receive stem cell transplant : About month first leukapheresis , return procedure repeat second time . This time , blood cell collect sample blood-forming stem cell . The stem cell give back chemotherapy . If high enough number stem cell collect , however , take study . A stem cell transplant part study 's treatment plan , case , participant study stem cell collect part another research study routine care . Chemotherapy Stem Cell Transplant : After stem cell successfully collect , admit hospital receive chemotherapy . You stay hospital 3-4 week . - On Day 1 , receive carmustine vein 1 hour . - Every 12 hour Days 2-5 , receive cytarabine vein 1 hour etoposide vein 3 hour . - On Day 6 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute . - On Day 7 , stem cell collect earlier give back ( `` transplant '' ) vein 30-45 minute . Day 7 also call Day 0 , since day transplant . The day transplant call Days +1 , +2 , . After stem cell transplant , study investigator decide still eligible receive T cell infusion ( IL-2 , assign receive ) . If infection intolerable side effect , take certain type steroid mouth injection , take study . If receive T cell infusion , would need return follow-up described . If prior involvement disease brain/spine area , physician may give different chemotherapy regimen consist following : - On Day 1 , receive carmustine vein 1 hour . - Every 12 hour Days 2-3 , receive thiotepa vein 1 hour - On Day 7 , stem cell collect earlier give back ( `` transplant '' ) vein 30-45 minute . Day 7 also call Day 0 , since day transplant . The day transplant call Days +1 , +2 , . T Cell Infusion ( Gene Transfer ) : You receive T cell infusion sometime Day +2 Day +7 . ( The exact day soon eligible . ) The T cell infusion give vein 15-30 minute . The infusion may divide two part least 24 hour apart . The first part infusion much small part ensure immediate side effect . During infusion , vital sign check . Alternatively , doctor may decide good receive infusion one day vein 15-30 minute . During infusion , vital sign check . Before T cell infusion , receive drug low risk allergic reaction T cell . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol® ) give mouth , diphenhydramine ( Benadryl® ) give vein minute . IL-2 Administration : If Group 2 4 , IL-2 inject skin , day 14 day . The first dose day T cell infusion . Before IL-2 injection , receive drug low risk allergic reaction IL-2 . Acetaminophen give mouth . Diphenhydramine give mouth vein minute . Study Tests : Every day hospital , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On day T-cell infusion , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask side effect may . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Within 3 day , 1 week , 2 week T cell infusion , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your medical history record . At 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month ( +/-5 day ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn research look modify T cell measure number B cell ( non-modified ) T cell . Like T cell , B cell part immune system . Follow-Up : At 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month stem cell transplant , return follow-up visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test research look modify T cell measure number B cell T cell . Part blood sample 12 month test HAMA . - Other test check health may also perform need , CT scan , PET/CT scan , and/or bone marrow aspiration biopsy . If disease come back side effect occur 12 month stem cell transplant , may ask return additional follow-up visit need . Length Study Participation : If infection intolerable side effect , take study early . If complete study plan , off-study last follow-up visit . Request Autopsy : In event death due cause , autopsy request family possible . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require patient receive gene transfer long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . You ask sign separate consent form long-term follow . That study know Protocol 2006-0676 , follow-up begin 1 year gene transfer study . This investigational study . The chemotherapy stem cell transplant study commercially available FDA approve . The gene transfer commercially available FDA approve . At time , gene transfer use research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
