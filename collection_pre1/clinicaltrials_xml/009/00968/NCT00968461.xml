	<brief_title>Study Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Lymphoproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : PEITC design cause build-up specific molecule cell , may damage cancer cell cause cell die . Study Drug Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level PEITC base join study . Up 9 dose level PEITC test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose PEITC find . Study Drug Administration : Every 28 day study 1 `` cycle . '' You take PEITC capsule mouth , 4 time day , Days 1-3 8-10 cycle . You take dose cup ( 8 ounce ) water , either without food . The dos take time day ( 7:00 AM , 12 noon , 5:00 PM , 10:00 PM ) . Study Visits : Once week , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test . These weekly blood draw occur Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 cycle , +/- 3 day . Follow-up After Completion Cycle 3 : Four ( 4 ) week start third cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration , fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) , and/or biopsy order check status disease . PK PD Testing : This study involve blood draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PD test use look level study drug body may affect disease . Blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn use test , follow schedule : - Day 1 Cycle 1 ( possibly day Day 1 ) - Days 1 , 2 , 3 Cycle 1 ( 4 hour day 's first dose PEITC ) - Day 4 Cycle 1 ( 12 hour last dose PEITC ) Length Study Participation : You may receive 6 cycle ( 24 week ) study drug . You take study drug early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : At end last study cycle , complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . In addition , unless disease completely respond , follow test procedure perform end-of-study visit : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease , study doctor think necessary . Follow-Up Visits : Every 3 6 month end last study cycle , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy study doctor think necessary check status disease way . Every 3 6 month end last study cycle , complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . After follow-up visit 24 week end last study cycle , schedule follow-up physical exam every 3 6 month . These visit may include blood draw bone marrow aspiration . Your study doctor decide test need . If disease return time , however , consider off-study . This mean also longer follow-up bone marrow sample collect part study . This investigational study . PEITC commercially available FDA approve . At time , use research . Up 54 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
