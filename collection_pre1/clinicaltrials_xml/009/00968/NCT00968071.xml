	<brief_title>Decitabine Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Acute Myelogenous Leukemia High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Gemtuzumab ozogamicin design attach Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 3 ( CD33 ) , certain protein often find leukemia cell , cause die . Decitabine design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive decitabine needle vein 1 1/2 hour Days 1-5 cycle . You also receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin vein 1 hour receive decitabine Day 5 4-6 week cycle . During Cycle 1 , bone marrow test do 2 week receive first study drug treatment show abnormal leukemia cell , receive another treatment decitabine intravenously 1 1/2 hour 5 day . Gemtuzumab may cause allergic reaction , nausea , vomit . To help prevent side effect , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) hydrocortisone . You may receive drug vein , mouth day get gemtuzumab ozogamicin entire study . Study Visits : During Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw least 1 time week routine test . If doctor think necessary , may ask additional blood drawn . During Cycle 1 , approximately 2 week first study drug administration , bone marrow aspiration decide whether receive additional decitabine Cycle 1 . During Cycles 2-3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least 2 time month . During Cycles 4 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least 1 time month . If doctor think necessary , may bone marrow aspirate every 1 3 month check status disease . Length Study : You may receive combination decitabine gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 cycle . After , doctor think best interest , may continue take decitabine alone 24 cycle . You take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think longer best interest receive study drug ( ) . Long-term Follow-up : Once study , follow visit every month 2 year . At visit , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Gemtuzumab ozogamicin FDA approve commercially available treatment AML come back treatment patient age 65 year . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . The use gemtuzumab ozogamicin decitabine combination investigational . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
