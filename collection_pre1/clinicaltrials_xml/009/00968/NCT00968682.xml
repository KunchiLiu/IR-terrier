	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood laboratory patient cancer treat trastuzumab may help doctor learn biomarkers related heart dysfunction . It may also help doctor predict patient develop heart dysfunction . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study biomarkers see well predict heart dysfunction woman breast cancer treat trastuzumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CADY Study ICORG 08-01</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To prospectively evaluate whether increase cardiac biomarker level predict cardiac dysfunction woman HER2/neu-positive breast cancer treat trastuzumab curative intent . Secondary - To develop predictive model use patient population base accurate sensitive combination biomarkers . This observational study patient - Blood test BNP , Nt-pro BNP , CRP Troponin-T every 42 day ( 6 week ) whilst treatment chemotherapy and/or Trastuzumab . - Echocardiograph MUGA treatment , completion anthracycline therapy applicable , every twelve week whilst Trastuzumab . Assessment ejection fraction may carry time symptom . All Echocardiographs MUGAs carry locally . 2-D Echocardiograph prefer method assessment LVEF . Where possible , cardiac imaging facility use LVEF assessment . A sample study participate institution review principal investigating cardiologist . Results leave ventricular function assessment use make treatment decision normal . Managing clinician make aware result biomarker assessment , thus study blind . - Cardiorespiratory symptom assessment , ECOG score , vitals , weight NYHA ( applicable ) prior dose anthracyclines every 6 week whilst Paclitaxel-trastuzumab single agent Trastuzumab . Patients BETH : The LVEF monitoring sequence require CADY alter parallel require BETH . Thus , echocardiograph MUGA carry accord BETH cardiac safety monitoring protocol . This altered schedule applies patient enrolled study . Of note , patient BETH study , LVEF assessments must perform method use baseline . Patients ALTTO : It possible patient enrol CADY ALLTO may eventually receive Trastuzumab . Nonetheless , Lapatinib also associate risk cardiotoxicity , patient remain study whilst receive single agent Lapatinib . The schedule study assessment identical patient receive Trastuzumab . For patient enrolled study , LVEF monitor sequence require CADY alter parallel require ALLTO . Thus , echocardiograph MUGA carry accord ALLTO cardiac safety monitor protocol Of note , patient ALLTO study , LVEF assessments must perform method use baseline .</detailed_description>
