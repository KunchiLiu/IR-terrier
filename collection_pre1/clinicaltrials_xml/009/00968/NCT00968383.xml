	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether open occlude infarcted artery 3-28 day acute myocardial infarction high-risk asymptomatic patient preserve infarct zone viability improve leave ventricular systolic function volume 6 month follow-up . The secondary purpose ass change myocardial tissue characteristic late percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rapid restoration blood flow infarct-related artery ( IRA ) , one cornerstone contemporary treatment acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) prevent myocardial necrosis consequence . However , due late presentation fail fibrinolytic therapy one third patient persistently occlude IRA MI . Recently , Occluded Artery Trial ( OAT ) demonstrate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) optimal medical therapy reduce frequency major adverse event compare optimal medical therapy alone perform day 3-28 post MI stable patient . Assessment infarct zone viability use inclusion/exclusion criterion main OAT trial . Several study confirm patient leave ventricular systolic dysfunction preserve myocardial viability ( necrosis transmurality &lt; 50 % segment infarct zone ) assess magnetic resonance imaging benefit revascularization . Late opening occlude infarct-related artery patient preserve myocardial tissue viability may lead improvement leave ventricular volume function .</detailed_description>
