	<brief_summary>Most bone marrow transplant child sickle cell disease perform use high dos two chemotherapy agent : busulfan cyclophosphamide pre-transplant conditioning . This approach produce cure case ( approximately 95 % ) . It , however , serious side effect , include seizure infertility . The primary goal study determine much low dosage busulfan cyclophosphamide incorporating fludarabine , safe chemotherapy agent , conditioning . The secondary goal develop well understand bone marrow transplant cause neurologic problem like seizure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many child sickle cell disease severely affect acute complication , especially stroke , recurrent debilitate pain , recurrent acute chest syndrome . As become adolescent young adult , patient sickle cell disease often develop chronic problem , include renal disease , chronic lung disease pulmonary hypertension . For child HLA match related donor , hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , use bone marrow cord blood effective cure ; use standard approach , relies high dos busulfan ( BU ) cyclophosphamide ( CY ) well anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) pre-transplant conditioning , probability event free survival approximately 95 % . The standard approach , however , frequently complicate acute often severe neurological event , seizure encephalopathy , well hypogonadism . Circumstantial evidence suggest sickle cell patient predispose transplant related neurological toxicity disease relate cerebrovascular injury , transplant process aggravate injury , cause cerebral ischemia , turn , neurological toxicity . The high dose chemotherapy , show induce endothelial injury , appear important contribute factor . The role high dose chemotherapy transplant relate neurotoxicity need firmly establish . The role high dose alkylating agent gonadal injury well establish . Fludarabine , non-vasculopathic , non-gonadotoxic agent , amplifies engraftment promote effect Cy ; effort lessen incidence transplant relate neurotoxicity gonadotoxicity , conduct pilot study fludarabine add BuCyATG conditioning , dose Bu Cy reduce use stepwise de-escalation schema . This study serve forerunner large trial design test safety efficacy reduce toxicity BuFluCyATG regimen . Central Hypothesis : A safe approach hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) develop child sickle cell disease without compromise efficacy . Specific Aims : 1 ) To begin develop reduce dose busulfan cyclophosphamide base condition regimen child sickle cell disease still achieve sustained engraftment least 90 % time , conduct pilot trial , standard busulfan , cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin condition regimen modify add fludarabine , non-vasculopathic non-gonadotoxic , yet highly immunosuppressive agent , order determine feasibility reduce total dose cyclophosphamide present standard 200 mg/kg 90 mg/kg busulfan present standard 12.8 mg/kg ( IV ) 6.4 mg/kg , use four step dose de-escalation schema.. 2 ) ) To begin assess vascular , specifically , cerebrovascular effect pre-transplant , high-dose busulfan cyclophosphamide child sickle cell disease obtain preliminary estimate longitudinal change blood level biomarkers endothelial dysfunction inflammation ( endothelin-1 , von Willebrand factor antigen , C-reactive protein , Il-8 thrombin-antithrombin ( TAT ) complex ) change two MRI biomarkers-cortical thickness measurement diffusion tensor imaging.. b ) To begin assess long-term effect replace sickle erythrocyte normal erythrocyte ( HSCT ) vasculature cerebrovasculature , use test . These estimate help u calculate sample size refine test second study .</detailed_description>
