	<brief_title>The Safety Autologous Lyophilized Plasma Versus Fresh Frozen Plasma Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This `` first-in-human '' Phase I , single-center , dose escalation study ( use 3 dose level ) propose assess safety infuse reconstitute lyophilized human plasma ( LyP ) . The study design incorporate plasmapheresis-derived autologous plasma ( FFP ) infusion ( ) eliminate variable event know related allogenic transfusion . Subjects enrol blood center provide autologous FFP ship sponsor site use start material manufacture LyP . Once manufacture complete , LyP ( autologous ) return blood center reconstitution infusion subject . Maximum dosage within study approach `` massive transfusion '' ( 1 liter Cohort 3 ) obtain preliminary assessment safety . One half FFP obtain subject Cohort 3 ( ) ship sponsor return site ( manufactured LyP ) serve control ( autologous FFP ) .</detailed_description>
