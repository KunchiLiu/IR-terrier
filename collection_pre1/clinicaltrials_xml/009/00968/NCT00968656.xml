	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old biopsyproven breast cancer , head &amp; neck cancer diffuse large Bcell lymphoma . For determination Ki67 , Sphase , mitotic index , sigma2 receptor assessment , cancer subject must schedule undergo surgical resection primary tumor without intervene therapy , schedule undergo ( already undergone ) tissue sample either standard care part another research project prior plan treatment cancer . For tumor sigma2 receptor assessment , 0.5 g fresh tumor tissue keep frozen dry ice need , proliferative marker may determine much small specimen . Thus , possible analysis sigma2 receptor may possible patient , obtain 0.5 g tumor specimen may practical patient . Newly diagnose breast cancer , head &amp; neck cancer , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma subject primary lesion size â‰¥ 1.5 cm determine image study ( ultrasonography , mammography , CT MRI ) physical examination receive treatment cancer . Able give inform consent . Not currently pregnant nursing : Female subject must either surgically sterile ( documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or document hysterectomy ) , post menopausal ( cessation menses 1 year ) . If childbearing potential , urine pregnancy test must perform within 24 hour period immediately prior administration [ 18F ] ISO1 determine negative . Patients invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , ( ) evidence cancer present within last 5 year . Lymphoma patient receive treatment past new diagnosis diffuse large Bcell lymphoma eligible participate provide undergo tissue sample specify inclusion criterion . Unable tolerate 6090 minute PET imaging .</criteria>
