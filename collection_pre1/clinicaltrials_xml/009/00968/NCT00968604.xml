	<brief_title>C-VISA BikDD : Liposome Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : BikDD modify gene product design make cancer cell destroy . Delivering BikDD fat molecule ( BikDD nanoparticle ) may improve delivery gene product cell . This may help stop slow growth pancreatic cancer . This first study use BikDD nanoparticle human . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level BikDD nanoparticle base join study . Different dose level BikDD nanoparticle test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose level , intolerable side effect see . If intolerable side effect see , next group participant receive low dose . This continue high tolerable dose BikDD nanoparticle find . The dose study drug receive never increase . However , side effect , dose study drug may lower . Your doctor discus dose receive . Study Drug Administration : There 28 day cycle . The study visit schedule describe . In certain circumstance , permission doctor , study visit may occur 2 3 day earlier later describe . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , receive BikDD nanoparticle needle vein 10 minute . Study Visits : Liver Tumor Biopsy : Before receive study drug , biopsy liver tumor . Researchers compare biopsy later biopsy learn BikDD nanoparticle able reach tumor effect cancer . You awake biopsy . A radiologist find tumor help scan ultrasound CT scan . You receive local anesthetic . A needle inserted skin tumor , tissue sample ( ) take . You receive fluid drug relaxation and/or pain need needle arm hand . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your vital sign measure 5 time . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug and/or supplement take take since last visit . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - On Day 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn 9 time pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw 1 time PK test . On Days 4 , 11 , 18 , 25 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may . On Day 24 Cycle 1 , biopsy liver tumor learn BikDD nanoparticle reach tumor effect cancer . If reason biopsy ca n't perform , may ask biopsy 6-8 day later . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : Your medical history record , include drug and/or supplement take take since last visit . - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your vital sign measure 5 time . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ECG . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Your vital sign measure 5 time . - You ask side effect may experience . At end Cycle 2 every cycle ( Cycle 4 , 6 , 8 , ) , CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure CA 19-9 level . Because may take time effect BikDD may tumor know , study doctor may decide continue BikDD even scan/MRI show tumor worse . In case , another CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis 4 6 week later . If cancer worse , stop BikDD . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record , include drug and/or supplement take take since last visit . - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your vital sign measure 5 time . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may experience . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 3 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - Your vital sign measure 5 time . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug long doctor think best interest . If cancer disappear , receive 2 extra cycle study drug stop study drug . You take study disease get bad , doctor decides best interest stop drug , experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : Once stop study drug reason , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform . - Your medical history record , include drug and/or supplement take take since last visit . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may experience . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test measure CA 19-9 level . - If one within last 4 week , CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease Once week least 30 day last dose study drug , ask experiencing side effect . If clinic visit already schedule , call . If call , take 5-10 minute . If experience side effect , may continue follow-up visit medical problem go away stabilize . Follow-Up : Every 2 month , study staff continue see , either routine clinic visit phone . If call , last 5-10 minute . If move , also ask provide new address telephone number doctor . This investigational study . BikDD nanoparticle FDA approve commercially available . At time , BikDD nanoparticle use research . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M D Anderson .</detailed_description>
