	<brief_summary>Tissue expansion enjoy wide range application since technique popularize latter quarter last century . During expansion process , subcutaneous fat liquefies , skin become thinner , muscle atrophy , blood inflow increase , lymphatics get occlude . All factor predispose seroma formation implant extrusion . A similar problem occur lymphoedema patient , one line treatment creation connection deep lymphatics facilitate absorption accumulate fluid . The principle extrapolate patient tissue expanders insert neck limb effect note incidence seroma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The technique tissue expansion use many year expand normal skin adjacent site defect . Initially describe Neuman 1953 , gain widespread popularity eighth decade last century work Radovan , progressively popular since . The physiology prolong tissue expansion matter stretch skin , actual formation additional new skin attribute original tissue . Austad et al . postulate tissue expansion cause decrease cell density basal layer skin cell density might regulate skin mitotic activity . A low cell density result great cell proliferation , result growth additional skin . Inflation tissue expander find cause threefold elevation epidermal mitotic activity within 24 hour , follow gradual return normal baseline 2 5 day . Conversely , deflation expander cause transient decrease epidermal mitotic activity . The increase mitosis return normal 4 week expansion . The dermis subcutaneous tissue thin result tissue expansion lead overall decrease tensile strength expand skin ( 5-7 ) persist 36 week expansion . The subcutaneous layer fat intolerant stretch cause significant thinning . With fast expansion , fat necrosis could see . Pressure necrosis subcutaneous fat lead liquefaction seroma formation . With progression expansion compression superficial lymphatics result occlusion lymph accumulation . Furthermore , muscle layer pig , similar platysmal layer human , tend atrophy maximal expansion . As expansion proceed , increase number size blood vessel within flap supply random-pattern vessel , present , axial vessel . These change correspond demonstrated increase blood flow expand flap . In study Saxby lead survive lengths expansion 50 percent great delayed control , nearly 150 percent great comparable flap raise acutely . These histologic physiologic finding would explain high incidence seroma formation tissue expanders especially insert area rich subcutaneous fat , neck limb . During expansion process , subcutaneous fat liquefies , skin become thinner , muscle atrophy , blood inflow increase , lymphatics get occlude . All factor couple fact mere presence foreign body incite fluid exudation would frank invitation seroma formation implant extrusion . Reported rate seroma varied literature 5-18 % . Its effect range minor complication interrupt expansion process require operative intervention ( 32 % ) major complication require additional operative intervention ( 12 % ) . Opinions differ author regard seroma prevention . Several author omit use drainage procedure prevent infection . Others use closed suction drain increase risk infection ; seromas tend occur follow removal . External filling port might drain seromas entry port , risk increase infection rate ( 19 ) . Over inflation expanders obliterate dead space come risk overlie skin ischemia necrosis . As projection hypothesis Thompson lymphoedema management , study perform find effect open new drainage channel superficial deep lymphatics incidence seroma formation .</detailed_description>
