Therefore , successful conduction publication two study result international journal severe severe pneumonia well severe malnutrition day-care clinic , mandatory perform final study investigator include severe malnutrition well associate co-morbidities apply treatment severe severe pneumonia child general make treatment approach widely applicable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Childhood Pneumonia With Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute low respiratory infection particulary pneumonia , lead cause childhood morbidity death develop country Bangladesh [ 3 ] . Acute respiratory tract infection cause 2 million child death worldwide year , mostly pneumonia 90 % occur less-developed country [ 4-6 ] . Recent estimate suggest 1.9 million ( 95 % CI 1.6 million 2.2 million ) child die acute respiratory tract infection throughout world 2000 , 70 % occur Africa Southeast Asia [ 7 ] . ARI also major cause visit outpatient emergency department well admission hospital . Although bronchiolitis , tracheobronchitis pneumonia , account one-third ALRI case , pneumonia responsible ALRI death . Three study report diagnosis child die ALRI reveal median 89 % ( range 71 % 100 % ) ALRI death associate pneumonia [ 8-10 ] . In Bangladesh , acute low respiratory tract infection account 25 % deaths under-5 age group 40 % infantile death [ 11 ] . A study conduct Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B 1986-88 401 under-5 child ALRI document pneumonia common among respiratory pathogen ( bacterial viral ) identify 30 % case . The case fatality rate 14 % bacterial pneumonia 3 % viral pneumonia [ 12 ] . Bacterial infection play major role childhood pneumonia develop country . Pooled data lung aspiration study , mostly develop country , report bacterial isolation rate 52-62 % [ 13 , 14 ] . The case-fatality rate severe ALRI child age 1-4 year report 10-15 time higher develop developed country [ 15 , 16 ] . It usually possible determine specific cause pneumonia either clinical chest X-ray feature . In child , Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae two important bacterial pathogen [ 17 , 18 ] . Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) also important cause ARI among preschool child [ 12 , 18 ] . Emerging evidence suggest Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause pneumonia among old child . Available data also suggest mixed viral bacterial infection common child develop country [ 12 ] , require antimicrobial therapy . The WHO recommendation treatment pneumonia base data Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae common cause bacterial pneumonia develop country [ 9 ] . Depending clinical presentation , pneumonia classify severe , severe non-severe , specific treatment guideline available [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . The WHO define severe pneumonia clinical symptom sign pneumonia ( cough difficulty breathe one danger sign like cyanosis , convulsion , drowsiness , stridor calm child inability drink , signify hypoxaemia severe respiratory distress ) severe clinical malnutrition [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Severe pneumonia define cough difficulty breathe low chest wall draw without fast breathing define respiratory rate ³ 50 breath per minute child age 2-11 month ³ 40 breath per minute child age 12-59 month [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Lower chest wall drawing define inward movement bony structure low chest wall inspiration , observe child rest [ 21 ] . Finally , non-severe pneumonia define cough difficulty breathe fast breathing define earlier [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Antibiotic therapy indicate irrespective severity pneumonia . Proper management child present health centre hospital respiratory symptom cornerstone acute respiratory infection control . To address high mortality associate ALRI , WHO launch programme control ARI major objective reduce child mortality promote rational use antibiotic . Current standard ARI case management recommend ambulatory treatment child cough normal breathe without antibiotic assume viral infection mild bacterial infection ; treatment rapid respiration ( tachypnoea ) indicate low respiratory infection pneumonia antibiotic ( non-severe pneumonia ) ; hospitalisation lower chest wall drawing ( indicative severe pneumonia ) treatment parenteral antibiotic supportive care [ 22 , 23 ] . Vaccination measles , pertussis , Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) Streptococcus pneumoniae help decrease incidence and/or lessen severity respiratory infection . However , new vaccine respiratory infection Hib pneumococcal conjugate vaccine widely available develop country . Under-5 child respiratory symptom bring general practitioner well primary health care facility treatment health care provider require differentiate acute upper respiratory infection ( AURI ) acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) /pneumonia , categorize severity pneumonia take consideration nutritional status patient , provide either ambulatory therapy refer patient hospitalization , appropriate . Management severe severe pneumonia child rely hospital-based treatment , practical barrier often prevent child area high rate receive hospital care . It recommend child severe severe pneumonia hospitalise [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] supportive treatment , include suction , oxygen therapy hypoxemia , fluid nutritional management , close monitoring [ 8 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . In Bangladesh , enough hospital bed admission severe severe case pneumonia . In addition , hospitalization may possible inability parent visit hospital . Reliable demographic information issue available hospital Bangladesh due poor record keep system . However , review data 2-month period ( May June 2007 ) Institute Child Health Shishu Sasthya Foundation Hospital ( ICHSH ) , Mirpur , Dhaka , observe 52/120 ( 43 % ) child severe severe pneumonia admit hospital , majority ( 57 % ) could admit due lack bed send home supportive therapy parenteral antibiotic outpatient department hospital . It therefore important provide institutional care child hospitalise . A prospective observational study conduct examine feasibility day-care-facility-based , modify primary care alternative child deny hospital admission would otherwise sent home . We develop prospectively evaluate day-care clinic approach management provide antibiotic , feed supportive care stay clinic , continuation care home parent effective alternative hospitalization child . We recently publish study result `` Day-care management severe severe pneumonia , without associate co-morbidities severe malnutrition , urban health clinic Dhaka , Bangladesh [ 1 ] '' . From June 2003 May 2005 , 251 child severe severe pneumonia enrol Radda Clinic . The mean±SD age child 7 ±7 month , 143/251 ( 57 % ) hypoxemic mean ± SD oxygen saturation 93 ± 4 % increase 98 ± 3 % oxygen therapy . The mean ± SD day-care period 7 ± 2 day . Day-care management severe severe pneumonia assess successful 234/251 [ 93 % ( 95 % CI , 89-96 % ) ] child , management assess fail remain 17/251 [ 7 % ( 95 % CI , 4.3-10.6 % ) ] child 11/251 [ 4.4 % ( 95 % CI , 2.5-7.7 % ) ] refer hospital 6/251 [ 2.4 % ( 95 % CI 1.1-5.1 % ) ] discontinue treatment . There deaths day-care study period ; however , 4/251 [ 1.6 % ( 95 % CI 0.6 % -4 % ) ] child die 3-month follow-up period , another 11/251 [ 4.4 % ( 95 % CI , 2.5-7.7 % ) ] require hospital admission 3-months ' follow-up period . The result study indicate child severe severe pneumonia without associate co-morbidities severe malnutrition successfully manage day-care clinic [ 1 ] . If day-care management find comparable efficacy hospitalize management severe severe pneumonia child could manage day-care set ups outpatient basis , reduce hospitalization thus free bed management child great need hospital care . Additionally , availability treatment facility community set-ups time-and cost-savings population . But , patient severe malnutrition exclude pilot study ethical reason , peer journal reviewer [ 1 ] correctly comment study finding generalise applied treatment severe severe pneumonia . Similarly , case-fatality severe malnutrition high 60 % 1990 's primarily due faulty case management [ 24-26 ] . The management severely malnourish child associate complication rely hospital-based treatment . In Bangladesh , hospital bed dedicated management severely malnourish child . Hospitalization may also possible result inability parent visit hospital either due distance financial reason ( ) , even appropriate referral . It , however , important provide institutional care child , least stabilization acute condition . If child send home antibiotic , would important establish expensive , home follow system , without significant proportion could reasonably expect fatal outcome . With implementation protocolised management Dhaka Hospital , ICDDR , B , case-fatality child reduce 19 % 5 % [ 27 , 28 ] . In another study , evaluate day-care clinic approach management severely malnourish child provide antibiotic , micronutrient , diet , supportive care stay establish day-care center , follow continuation care parent home effective alternative hospitalization . From February 2001 November 2003 , 264 severely malnourished child enrol Radda Clinic , receive protocolized management antibiotic , micronutrient milk-based diet 08:00 17:00 daily , mother educate continuation supportive care home night . They transition day-care nutrition rehabilitation unit ( NRU ) Radda Clinic follow resolution acute illness , receive NRU diet daily attainment 80 % weight-for-length . Fifty-two percent child boys , 78 % , 21 % 1 % child marasmus , marasmus-kwashiorkor kwashiorkor , respectively . Only 13 % severe malnutrition alone , 35 % pneumonia , 35 % diarrhoea 17 % pneumonia diarrhoea . The mean ± SD duration acute NRU phase 8 ± 4 14 ± 13 day respectively . The mean ± SD weight gain ( g/kg ) child rapid acute ( 10 ± 7 ) NRU phase ( 6 ± 5 ) . The day-care management severe malnutrition assess successful 216/264 [ 82 % ( 95 % CI , 77-86 % ) ] child , failure remain 48/264 [ 18 % ( 95 % CI , 14-23 % ) ] child 17/264 [ 6 % ( 95 % CI , 4-10 % ) ] refer hospital 31/264 [ 12 % ( 95 % CI , 8-16 % ) ] discontinue treatment . The result clearly demonstrate severely malnourished child could successfully manage exist day-care clinic use protocolized approach [ 2 ] . Therefore , successful conduction publication result two study management severe severe pneumonia [ 1 ] severe malnutrition [ 2 ] day-care clinic , prudent perform final study ass treatment child severe severe pneumonia association severe malnutrition possible day-care basis . If successful , treatment approach could widely applicable . In proposed study , would identify under-5 child severe severe pneumonia severe malnutrition with/without associate co-morbidities attend outpatient department Radda Clinic outpatient emergency department ICHSH randomize , equal number , management either day-care centre ( Radda Clinic ) hospital ( ICHSH ) , subject consent respective parents/guardians . About 3000 child pneumonia visit Radda Clinic year , estimate 200 severe severe pneumonia severe malnutrition require hospitalization . Similarly , 700 child severe severe pneumonia severe malnutrition visit outpatient emergency department ICHSH year . Our study patient select child population Radda Clinic ICHSH , hope complete enrolment requisite 440 ( 220/site ) child 3-year period study . Rationale Malnutrition severe malnutrition prevalent ALRI/pneumonia lead cause under-5 morbidity death Bangladesh . Hospital management recommend child either problem . However , simply enough bed hospitalise every child problem . It often possible provide appropriate treatment supportive care home child refuse admission hospital . With exception , childhood malnutrition problem poor , thus parent child severe malnutrition and/or pneumonia often unable provide private care child , time unable take child hospital far community . What happen child remain largely unknown ; however , many expect fatal outcome . Successful management child day-care clinic community would provide good access treatment care affordable parent . Proved effective , management could also implement Bangladesh potentially develop country . The day-care base management expect cost effective intervention contribute significantly reduction under-5 child mortality due severe severe pneumonia well severe malnutrition .</detailed_description>
