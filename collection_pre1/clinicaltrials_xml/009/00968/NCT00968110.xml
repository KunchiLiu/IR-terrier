	<brief_title>Xolair Treatment Milk Allergic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis pretreatment anti-IgE mAb greatly reduce side effect allergic reaction occur oral desensitization food enhance development oral tolerance patient severe milk allergy . Once desensitized milk , child able tolerate milk Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge . The study also evaluate whether Xolair provide robust durability tolerance administration Xolair terminate . We examine specific immunological mechanism mediate oral tolerance child undergo oral milk desensitization The trial conduct three part : ( 1 ) pre-treatment Xolair 8 week , ( 2 ) oral desensitization cow 's milk week 9-16 continued treatment Xolair 8 week , ( 3 ) double blind placebo control food challenge milk .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Moderate severe pediatric cow 's milk allergysensitive subject age 418 year old . Total IgE &gt; 30 kU/L Sensitivity cow 's milk allergen document positive skin prick test result ( see Appendix E detail ) RAST test cow 's milk , 25 kU/L low limit eligibility . Patients meet cow 's milk RAST requirement may eligible study history moderate severe reaction , recently fail oral food challenge milk order physician . All female subject childbearing potential require provide urine sample pregnancy test must negative one week allow participate study . Subjects must plan remain study area trial . Subjects and/or parent must train proper use EpiPen allow enroll study . No absolute contraindication allergen skin test and/or oral ingestion milk know . However , risk serious systemic anaphylactic reaction milk suggest number preexist condition consider relative contraindication . Among condition acute infection , autoimmune disease , severe cardiac disease , treatment betaadrenergic antagonistic drug ( betablockers ) . Subjects history severe anaphylaxis milk require intubation admission ICU , frequent allergic nonallergic urticaria , history consistent poorly control persistent asthma . Total IgE &gt; 2000 IU/mL . Subjects unstable angina , significant arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , chronic sinusitis , chronic immunological disease mind investigator might interfere evaluation administration test drug pose additional risk subject e.g . gastrointestinal gastroesophageal disease , chronic infection , scleroderma , hepatic gallbladder disease , chronic nonallergic pulmonary disease . Subject FEV1 PEF le 80 % predict ( moderate persistent asthma ) without controller medication ( able perform maneuver ) screening , oral desensitization visit , food challenge visit . Subjects received experimental drug last 30 day prior admission study plan use experimental drug study . Subjects current user oral , intramuscular , intravenous corticosteroid , tricyclic antidepressant , take betablocker ( oral topical ) . Subjects routinely use medication could induce adverse gastrointestinal reaction study . Subjects refuse sign EpiPen Training Form ( see Appendix F ) . Pregnant breast feeding female . Subjects history rice soy allergy .</criteria>
