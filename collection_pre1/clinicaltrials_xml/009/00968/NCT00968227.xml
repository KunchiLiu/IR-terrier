	<brief_title>Effect Red Blood Cell Transfusion Brain Metabolism Patients With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , approximately 30,000 people suffer aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) United States . The common potentially treatable cause secondary neurological injury population delay ischemic deficit ( DID ) . As name implies , phenomenon fundamentally reduction cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) oxygen delivery critical ischemic threshold , occur day onset hemorrhage . Three inter-related physiological process appear involve reduced oxygen delivery : severe narrow intracranial artery ( arterial vasospasm ) , intravascular volume depletion loss normal autoregulatory function distal circulation . DID occur 40 % patient survive SAH . One third patient die phenomenon another third leave permanent severe disability . The optimal treatment vasospasm know . Medical management involve number hemodynamic manipulation usually refer hypervolemic , hypertensive , hemodilution ( Triple-H ) therapy . Our knowledge physiological impact individual component combination limit clinical efficacy establish . The information gain study great potential advance knowledge regard role hematocrit optimal treatment often-devastating condition . Changes hematocrit potentially impact brain oxygen delivery two way . First , linear relationship hemoglobin arterial oxygen content , low hematocrit less oxygen . Thus give CBF lower hematocrit reduces brain oxygen delivery . Fortunately , brain responds increase blood flow restore oxygen delivery baseline level . Additionally , lower hematocrit another effect , reduces viscosity raise CBF , non-linear way . It relative contribution two effect determine oxygen delivery improve . It propose largely theoretical consideration `` optimal '' hematocrit achieve balance 30-35 % . Yet study date assess relationship hematocrit oxygen delivery SAH patient . Other observation , however , suggest high hemoglobin level SAH patient associate good outcome . Finally another retrospective review suggest receiving transfusion increase risk vasospasm poor outcome subarachnoid hemorrhage . We propose begin series study determine appropriate management hematocrit SAH patient . The first define appropriate physiologic response ( cerebral oxygen delivery metabolism ) change hematocrit . Then `` optimal '' hematocrit define . Only able properly design clinical outcome trial .</detailed_description>
