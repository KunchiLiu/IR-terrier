	<brief_title>RAD001 Study Treatment Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Everolimus design stop cancer cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . You receive everolimus 2 different chemotherapy combination alternate cycle . This mean receive 1 combination Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 combination Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . The first chemotherapy regimen call hyper-CVAD . Hyper-CVAD include cyclophosphamide , vincristine , Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) , dexamethasone . This combination design kill leukemia cell . The chemotherapy regimen include drug methotrexate ara-C ( cytarabine ) . This combination also design kill leukemia cell . Study Groups Everolimus Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 30 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose everolimus receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level everolimus . Each new group receive high dose everolimus group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose everolimus find . If enrol Phase II , receive everolimus high dose tolerate Phase I portion . In study , everolimus study drug different dose level test compare . All drug give dose level . Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : If already CVC , CVC place . A CVC plastic tube usually place collarbone . You sign separate consent procedure . Some study drug give CVC . Everolimus Administration : During cycle , take everolimus day follow big glass water . The tablet must chew , break crush . You may either take everolimus empty stomach low fat meal . Taking everolimus large , fatty meal advise low amount everolimus body absorbs . Some example low fat meal include : cereal fat free milk , muffin/bagel fat free spread , fruit salad , . Always follow instruction use everolimus give study doctor . Your first dose everolimus occur 1 day begin receive chemotherapy . Do miss tablets/capsules . You take everolimus time day preferably morning . If study doctor think need experience severe side effect , everolimus may stop start low dose may stop completely . Chemotherapy Administration : Each cycle last 21 day . The time new cycle depend blood count recover . Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 : During Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , receive hyper-CVAD . The drug give follow time : - On Days 1-3 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 2-3 hour every 12 hour . - On Days 1-4 11-14 , receive dexamethasone mouth vein . If vein , infusion take second . - On Day 4 , receive doxorubicin 24 hour CVC . - On Days 4 11 , receive vincristine vein 2-3 hour . Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 : During Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , receive methotrexate cytarabine vein follow : - On Day 1 , receive methotrexate vein 24 hour . - On Day 1 , may receive leucovorin ( citrovorum ) vein ( 15 minute ) 2-3 day . Leucovorin give help prevent methotrexate side effect . - On Days 2-3 , receive cytarabine vein 2 hour every 12 hour . - On Days 1-3 , receive methylprednisone 2 hour every 12 hour 6 dos . Cycles 1-8 : You also receive either Neupogen ( filgrastim ) pegfilgrastim help bone marrow recover chemotherapy . Filgrastim pegfilgrastim inject skin within 72 hour cycle chemotherapy . If receive filgrastim , give daily count recover . If receive pegfilgrastim , give 1 time . You also receive small dos methotrexate Ara-C , one , spinal tap help prevent disease come back fluid surround brain cycle . During spinal tap , doctor technician insert needle skin soft tissue low back reach pocket fluid part fluid space surround brain spinal cord . Once fluid space reach , chemotherapy drug administer . The procedure do local anesthesia . An Ommaya reservoir ( hold drug give ) may also implant surgically difficulty spinal treatment . An Ommaya reservoir tube insert skin scalp enters spinal fluid cavity brain . You ask sign separate consent form procedure . The number dose receive depend many dos study doctor think need . If start leukemia brain , give 2 time week leukemia present 1 time week 4 week . Sometimes , sample spinal fluid collect spinal tap may test look leukemia cell . Maintenance Chemotherapy : After complete 8 cycle , begin monthly ( every 28 day , depend blood cell count recovery ) maintenance chemotherapy next 24 month . You take follow drug : - You take 6-mercaptopurine mouth water every day . - You receive methotrexate vein ( 2 hour ) mouth every week . - You receive vincristine vein 30 minute every 28 day . - You take prednisone mouth 5 day every month . Study Visits : During Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test 1-3 time every week . During Cycles 2-8 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test every 1-4 week . During Cycles 1 2 , physical exam every week . After Cycle 2 , physical exam every 3-4 week . At Weeks 2 3 Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspirate check response . Depending result sample , repeated every 1-2 week . At Week 4-6 Cycle 1 , chest x-ray . After Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 8 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate . - You chest X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan need . If positive hepatitis B test screening , every month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw test level hepatitis B virus blood . If risk factor and/or positive Hepatitis C test result screen , every month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw test level Hepatitis C virus blood . Length Study : You may receive 32 cycle study drug . You take study early disease get bad , doctor decides best interest stop , intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 8 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate . - If doctor think need , chest x-ray CT scan . Follow-up Visits : You follow-up visit every 3 6 month . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You bone marrow aspirate . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , chest x-ray . This investigational study . All chemotherapy drug use study FDA approve commercially available treat ALL . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type breast cancer . At time , combination use research . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
