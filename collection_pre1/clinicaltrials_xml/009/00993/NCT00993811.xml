	<brief_title>The Shang Ring : A Novel Male Circumcision Device HIV Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three randomized clinical trial ( RCTs ) confirm benefit voluntary medical male circumcision ( VMMC ) reduce acquisition HIV circumcise men . In Africa , VMMC commonly perform method describe WHO Manual Male Circumcision Local Anaesthesia ( i.e. , forceps-guided , dorsal slit sleeve method ) . Modelers estimate scale-up VMMC prevent large number HIV infection require million circumcision next 5 10 year , 10 million circumcision 2012 base aggressive scale-up plan . Neonatal circumcision common procedure subject numerous clinical trial . With use simple device , neonatal circumcision rapid safe . In contrast , current adult surgical technique do freehand . Adolescent adult male medical circumcision rarely perform procedure developed country . Circumcision suffer little research could make possible either ( ) comparison simplification surgical technique ( b ) development device facilitate procedure . Current techniques time consume require long training period produce skilled personnel . Each procedure typically take 20 40 minute . A search efficient adult circumcision technique undertaken consultant World Health Organization ( WHO ) Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation . Preliminary discussion help produce proposal suggest Shang Ring one promise exist device could greatly simplify adult circumcision . More efficient simpler technique could potentially : - Reduce operating time cost supply - Improve safety procedure - Permit rapid train non-physician health care provider - Accelerate process scale proven HIV prevention strategy The Shang Ring relatively new device , manufacture SNNDA , small company base Wuhu , China own Mr. Shang Jianzhong Shang . It approve market China since 2005 , sale 40,000 device past couple year . The Shang Ring award CE Mark European Union October , 2008 . The Shang Ring potential dramatically reduce time need surgical procedure , current 20 430 minute , average 5 3 10 minute per procedure . This efficiency would greatly increase productivity large scale VMMC effort . The Shang Ring several unique advantage compare device currently use , include suitability use adult , small size , simple design , ease application . It clamp- type device , need cautery hemostasis , , suture hemostasis , wound closure . The manufacturer agree negotiate low public sector price would affordable circumcision program Africa . Project goal , objectives critical milestone : We propose conduct multicenter RCT compare Shang Ring standard surgical technique , sample size 500 men Shang Ring group 500 men standard surgery group . We conduct cost study compare time resource need technique . We also assist SNNDA prepare submit dossier regulatory authority United States least three African country , assist need SNNDA 's application U.S. FDA 510 ( k ) clearance . Circumcision device consider class II device U.S. FDA . We request FDA grant marketing clearance Shang Ring 510 ( k ) process , similar recent circumcision device approval . We propose conduct activity 30-month period . If successful , could lead wide use Shang Ring dramatic efficiency scale VMMC program .</detailed_description>
