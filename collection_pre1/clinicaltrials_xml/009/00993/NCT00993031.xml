	<detailed_description>The study site Tororo district hospital campus situate Eastern Uganda , area high malaria transmission . Using convenience sampling , enroll 500 HIV-infected pregnant woman infant Tororo community . Eligible woman 12-28 week gestation randomize enrollment receive either PI- base NNRTI-based ART regimen stratification gravidity ( G1 versus G2+ ) gestational age ( &lt; 24 week versus ≥ 24 week enrollment ) . Treatment group A receive Zidovudine 300mg + Lamivudine 150mg + Lopinavir/ritonavir 200mg/50mg . Treatment group B receive Zidovudine 300mg + Lamivudine 150mg + Efavirenz 600mg . At enrollment , study participant receive long lasting ITN , available , basic care package include safe water vessel , multivitamins condom , per current standard care HIV-infected pregnant woman Uganda , already receive intervention referral site . Two ITNs provide mother-infant pair . Participants receive routine acute medical care designate study clinic open 7 day week 8 a.m. 5 p.m . If medical care need hour , participant instruct come Tororo District Hospital premise ( study clinic locate ) request study physician on-call contact . They follow time enrollment pregnancy cessation breastfeeding ; see monthly routine assessment laboratory evaluation . Following delivery , infant enrol woman follow 6 week follow cessation breastfeed beyond 58 week life . Study participant follow closely adverse event potentially due study drug malaria HIV treatment outcome . During follow-up period , patient present clinic new episode fever undergo standard evaluation ( history , physical examination Giemsa-stained blood smear ) diagnosis malaria . Women receive study treatment time study entry randomization ( 12-28 week gestation ) 1 week follow cessation breastfeeding ( longer 1 year + 1 week postpartum ) . If subject experience toxicity endpoint , ART change provide antiviral activity prior delivery . Exclusive breastfeed encourage 24 week postpartum standard care Uganda . As per update WHO guideline , woman encourage introduce food 6 month life continue breastfeed 1 year life . Women counsel wean course 1 month continue antiretrovirals least 1 week follow weaning . Furthermore , infant find HIV-infected , Uganda MOH WHO guideline recommend continuation breastfeed 2 year life daily TS . All woman receive daily oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( TS ) per Ugandan MOH guideline . Per Ugandan MOH guideline , newborn receive nevirapine syrup ( 10mg/ml ) start within 12 hour birth 6 week , daily oral TS 6 week life 6 week follow cessation breastfeeding , mother instruct ITN use infant .</detailed_description>
