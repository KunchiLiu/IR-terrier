	<brief_summary>The long-term objective research understand molecular mechanism acquire endocrine resistance breast cancer . Identifying mechanisms critical implementation novel therapeutic strategy target overcome altered gene network involve control breast cancer progression . While patient tumor express HER1 , 2 , 3 show reduced survival , patient tumor overexpressed HER4 ( erbB4 ) increase survival ( Witton 2003 ) . This non-randomized , single-arm , proof principle trial . Selected patient advanced-stage breast cancer whose tumor ER+ , tamoxifen refractory . Histologically proven diagnosis recurrent metastatic breast cancer advance cancer treatment available would reasonable chance cure . Treatment failure define tumor progression chemotherapy tamoxifen therapy . Patients give five 30mg dos HDAC inhibitor ( LBH ) period two week . A dose take Days 1,3,5,8 10 . Patients diagnostic tumor biopsy prior drug administration diagnostic biopsy within 48 hour ( 2 day ) last dose . Primary endpoint measure biopsy palpable tumor immunohistochemical staining ERBB4 . Secondary end point include evaluation cell death , apoptosis , immunohistochemical stain DNA break TUNEL assay .</brief_summary>
