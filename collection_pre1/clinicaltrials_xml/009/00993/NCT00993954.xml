	<brief_summary>Radial head subluxation , also know pull elbow nursemaid 's elbow , one common upper extremity injury young child common reason emergency department visit.1 The injury typically occur forceful longitudinal traction apply extend pronate forearm.2 Children radial head subluxation usually easily recognize clinical presentation rapidly treat simple reduction technique involve either hyperpronation supination flexion injure arm.3-7 Despite relative ease diagnosis treatment , child radial head subluxation often wait several hour pediatric emergency department reduction take minutes.8 Such visit direct health care cost involve time stress child family . While many factor associate parental patient satisfaction emergency department , appear early treatment intervention shorter wait time correlate patient parent satisfaction.9,10 As well , patient satisfaction appear good emergency department care minor injury provide nurse practitioner compare physicians.11-13 Increasingly nurse initiate treatment use medical directive clinical pathway become focus provide health care.14-17 While radial head subluxation treatment appropriate area consider management emergency department nurse , study examine role management common injury . Our study 's objective examine whether triage nurse , train use medical directive taught recognition treatment radial head subluxation , could successfully reduce radial head subluxation rate similar physician . Given practical constraint time emergency department triage , study design cluster randomize trial unit randomization day patient give day assign nurse physician arm entire day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : We perform open ( i.e . unblinded ) non-inferiority , cluster-randomized control trial , ass whether emergency department triage nurse could , use medical directive give specific training , achieve rate successful reduction radial head subluxation substantially low physician . The Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board approve study ( REB approval number 08-29X ) . A cluster randomize trial design use facilitate enrollment patient . The unpredictable acuity volume patient present emergency department triage area make randomization patient level unfeasible . Patients assign day presentation either nurse physician treatment . Each day represent cluster . The anticipated number child present emergency department per day radial head subluxation less one , therefore reduction power due clustering expect inconsequential . Since study assessment practice change ( medical directive nurse initiate reduction presume radial head subluxation ) , write , informed consent deem unnecessary responsible research ethic board . On nurse initiate reduction day verbal consent procedure obtain caregiver eligible child prior nurse 's attempt reduction . This consent record study case report form . Study set participant : All child present emergency department Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( CHEO ) presume diagnosis radial head subluxation October 2009 October 2010 screen enrolment . CHEO tertiary care pediatric hospital approximately 55,000 emergency department visit per year time study . There 60 nurse work emergency department , majority train triage nurse . All triage nurse minimum 2 year experience , attend compulsory 4-hour orientation course , complete three 4-hour shift alongside experience triage nurse . Physician coverage include 26 full-time physician specific train pediatric emergency medicine 18 part-time staff physician type train ( include general pediatrics , emergency medicine , family practice ) , addition pediatric emergency fellow , resident , medical student work supervision . Children eligible study meet eligibility criterion radial head subluxation medical direction ( Appendix 1 ) . Development medical directive training nurse : A multidisciplinary team develop medical directive accord institutional process . The medical directive permit triage nurse attempt reduction child present sign symptom compatible radial head subluxation . Children eligible medical directive met follow criterion : ( 1 ) include 6 year age , ( 2 ) physical exam consistent radial head subluxation include use affected limb , hold elbow extension slight flexion , forearm hyperpronation , distress elbow movement , ( 3 ) injury within precede 12 hour . Children exclude directive following : ( 1 ) unknown mechanism injury , ( 2 ) deformity clavicle arm , ( 3 ) swell elbow wrist , ( 4 ) significant tenderness palpation arm , ( 5 ) metabolic bone disease ( osteogenesis imperfecta ) , ( 6 ) neuromuscular disorder exclude adequate assessment ( cerebral palsy ) , ( 7 ) concern abuse neglect . A multimodal training initiative use educate nurse medical directive . This include short instructional video feature reduction technique , didactic presentation physiology presentation radial head subluxation , hands-on , one hour training session provide either study investigator study coordinator ( nurse ) . Training involved instruction common reduction method , namely hyperpronation supination-flexion.4-7 The triage nurse allow initiate reduction train component complete . The medical directive instruct nurse first use hyperpronation reduction technique supination-flexion technique , give evidence hyperpronation may successful.18 Study protocol : A computer-generated randomization calendar schedule prepare advance , study statistician , entire patient recruitment period . The statistician role recruitment patient investigator aware schedule advance . The sequence compose randomly permute block block size eight . Since emergency department census vary daily seasonally , use permuted-block randomization ensure approximate balance nurse-initiated physician-initiated treatment day study . The sequence keep concealed beginning calendar week , sequence week reveal post throughout department . The weekly calendar indicate whether give day `` nurse-initiated '' `` physician-initiated '' day . To ensure comparability group , child meet criterion probable radial head subluxation accord medical directive eligible study nurse-initiated physician-initiated treatment day . Children , history , appear radial head subluxation , spontaneous reduction injury prior assessment randomize care provider include study . On nurse initiated day , child presume radial head subluxation identify triage nurse . Once patient identify triage nurse presume radial head subluxation , patient 's age , sex , arm injure time mechanism injury prospectively collect use standardize data form . The triage nurse , parent 's verbal consent , attempt reduction , first use hyperpronation method.4-7 If child begin use arm normally within 10 minute attempt , second reduction attempt via supination-flexion method.4-7 If time point child still normal arm usage place queue see emergency department physician per triage time Pediatric Canadian Triage Acuity Scale category ( pedsCTAS ) .19 If reduction successful ( i.e . : child use arm normally ) triage nurse record time normal arm usage standardize data form emergency department physician ask confirm normal function prior discharge . If family provide verbal consent nurse attempt reduction , child place queue see physician per triage time triage category . On physician assign day , patient presume radial head subluxation typically identify triage nurse , would place standardized study data form patient 's chart , patient could also identify treat physician . On physician treatment day , child place queue see emergency physician triage time pedsCTAS category . Patients see via usual emergency department practice either trainee ( medical student , resident , fellow ) staff treat per usual standard . We standardize type order reduction manoeuvre physician-initiated treatment group . The treat physician ask record time normal arm usage reduction method use . Data abstract emergency department record enrol child study coordinator related final diagnosis , discharge time , follow-up recommendation , investigation order ( x-ray ) result . The study coordinator also complete daily review emergency department chart determine many child final diagnosis radial head subluxation study , many enrol , enrol , many meet medical directive eligibility criterion ( base detail document triage document , nursing note , physician note ) .</detailed_description>
