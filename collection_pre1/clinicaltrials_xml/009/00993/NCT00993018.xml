	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment patient receives ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance compare study medication test whether study medication real effect clinical study ) , dose-ranging study ( study carry different dos ) evaluate analgesic efficacy , safety , tolerability multiple dose JNJ-42160443 patient neuropathic pain , follow double-blind safety extension open-label ( people know identity intervention ) safety extension . The study consist 5 sequential phase : 1 ) screening , 2 ) 12-week double-blind efficacy , 3 ) 40-week double-blind safety extension , 4 ) 52-week open-label safety extension , 5 ) 26-week post-treatment/follow-up . After screen phase , patient randomization stratify current pain medication use ( patient currently use currently use permit pain medication ) . The planned dos double-blind efficacy phase double blind safety extension phase placebo , JNJ-42160443 1 , 3 , 10 mg administer single , subcutaneous injection every 28 day . Safety assessment include adverse event , injection site evaluation , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , vital sign , physical examination , neurological examination , joint safety monitor throughout study . The total study duration ( include 5 phase ) approximately 131 week .</detailed_description>
