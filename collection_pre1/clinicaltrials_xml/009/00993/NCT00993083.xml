	<brief_summary>This Phase IIa open label , non placebo control , non-randomised control challenge study . The primary objective study assess safety new influenza vaccine , MVA-NP+M1 , administer single dose healthy volunteer . Initially two volunteer vaccinate challenged Influenza , follow vaccination 12 volunteer Influenza challenge 12 along 12 non-vaccinated control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Efficacy New Influenza Candidate Vaccine MVA-NP+M1 In Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibodies external protein influenza prevent virus infect cell either prevent infection limit spread infection . However surface protein highly variable little antibody cross-reactivity variant . Once cell infected virus , vulnerable T cell attack result destruction infect cell virus produce infection control . There evidence clinical trial influenza challenge , animal model T cell response protect absence antibody . Additionally , since T cell recognise highly conserve internal protein influenza , cross-subtype protection achieve . Seasonal influenza infection result T cell response virus protect subsequent infection . However course year responses decline protective level . The new vaccine test study design boost T cell responses back protective level . Even response may low reliably quantify currently available assay may still boost high level single dose recombinant MVA . Since internal protein vary little influenza subtypes , could result 'universal ' vaccine influenza A . If need continually reformulate vaccine response mutation viral coat protein remove , universal vaccine could produce large amount use widely exist seasonal 'flu vaccine , thus protect population currently circulate virus new virus type present find avian specie . There little polymorphism NP M1 influenza A isolates . NP 92 % identical H3N2 H1N1 strain , 91 % identical H3N2 H5N1 strain . M1 95 % identical H3N2 H1N1 strain , 93 % identical H3N2 H5N1 strain . This low level variation appear allow strong T cell cross-reactivity . MVA highly attenuate strain vaccinia virus unable replicate efficiently human cell line mammalian cell . Viral replication block late stage virion assembly , , importantly , viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired . This mean MVA efficient single round expression vector , incapable cause infection mammal . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA see exceptionally safe viral vector . This safety man consistent avirulence MVA animal model , recombinant MVAs also show protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . Importantly vaccine may eventually use large proportion population , recombinant MVAs express HIV antigen show safe immunogenic HIV-infected subject .</detailed_description>
