	<brief_title>Glycemic Effect Colesevelam HCl ( Welchol ) Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To understand effect addition colesevelam HCl oral agent therapy individual type 2 diabetes glycemic control utilize novel technology , continuous glucose monitoring ambulatory glucose profile analysis . To date study compound employed continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) ambulatory glucose profile ( AGP ) analysis obtain data detail diurnal glucose pattern associate therapy . We plan employ CGM critical point throughout study . AGP analysis enable rapid assessment clinical status subject . Using statistically stable estimate hourly value represent five percentile curve AGP depicts glucose exposure , variability stability . Previously , use AGP analysis characterize glucose perturbation individual range normal glucose tolerance overt type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
