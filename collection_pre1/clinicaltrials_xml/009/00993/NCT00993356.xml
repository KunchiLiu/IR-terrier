	<brief_title>Preoperative Lanreotide Treatment Acromegalic Patients With Macroadenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acromegaly rare disease , cause growth hormone ( GH ) -secreting adenoma even seldom instance ( 1 % ) due excessive growth hormone-releasing hormone ( GHRH ) secretion , usually carcinoid tumor lung gastrointestinal tract . The incidence acromegaly 3-4 per 1 million per year prevalence 60-70 per 1 million , without geographical sex difference . Clinical feature acromegaly include acral enlargement , prognathism , jaw malocclusion , arthropathy , carpal tunnel syndrome , hyperhydrosis , sleep apnea , visceromegaly . Transsphenoidal neurosurgery , allow selective removal pituitary adenoma , current first treatment acromegaly majority patient . Its effect GH insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) secretion rapid operation low morbidity low mortality . However , surgery macroadenomas cause acromegaly much low surgical success rate microadenomas . In experienced hand , microadenomas expect cure around 90 % , whereas macroadenomas figure around 50 % . This particularly case tumour extend cavernous sinus surgical success &lt; 50 % . Medical treatment acromegaly somatostatin analog ( SSAs ) lead normalize GH IGF-I level relief symptom . SSA treatment may cause shrinkage GH-secreting pituitary adenoma . Theoretically , could improve likelihood radical resection , particularly macroadenomas . Furthermore , suggest SSA treatment softens tumor parenchyma thereby facilitates tumor removal . Finally , report SSA pretreatment lead shorten postoperative hospital stay . Previous study address preoperative SSA treatment subsequent surgical cure rate conflict , report benefit , difference group . And report study rather small make retrospect , conduct prospective , randomize study investigate whether 4-month preoperative lanreotide treatment would improve surgical cure rate newly diagnose acromegalic patient macroadenomas . We also aim investigate whether difference incidence surgical complication , duration neurosurgical hospital stay .</detailed_description>
