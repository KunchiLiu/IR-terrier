	<brief_summary>This study open , non- randomize , phase I , dose-escalating study evaluate safety tolerance Amphinex base PCI bleomycin patient local recurrent advanced/metastatic , cutaneous sub-cutaneous malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Amphinex Based Photochemical Internalisation ( PCI ) Bleomycin Patients With Cutaneous Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient include cohort 3 patient . The initial start dose Amphinex give 4 day prior fix dose bleomycin administer intravenous infusion . The illumination , red light ( laser 652 nm ) , tumour surface margin 2-3 mm outside tumour surface , perform bleomycin administration . There comparative procedure study . Dose escalation proceed accord modification Simon 's accelerated titration design . The number patient recruit depends DLT experience . A total 6 patient include dose level 1 patient experience DLT . Additional cohort may add pending outcome previous cohort discussion investigator Sponsor . The primary goal study assess safety tolerance Amphinex determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) Amphinex PCI therapy combination bleomycin treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female age 18 year give write informed consent . Skin type I IV accord Fitzpatrick skin classification ( see appendix G ) . With diagnosis local recurrence advanced/metastatic , cutaneous subcutaneous malignancy Lesion measurement must do 2 week begin treatment . More one field lesion illuminate , care must take avoid overlap field illuminate . Have discontinue previous therapy cancer , include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , anticancer hormone therapy , investigational therapy least 2 week prior study entry , recover acute effect therapy . Have performance status 02 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Scale ( see appendix D ) . Clinically assess eligible bleomycin chemotherapy . Have predict life expectancy least 3 month . Geographic proximity allow adequate followup . If female : childbearing potential either terminate surgery , radiation , menopause attenuate use approve contraceptive method 3 month trial . If male : reproductive potential either terminate attenuated use approve contraceptive method 3 month trial . Have receive prior PCI . Tumours known erode major blood vessel adjacent illumination site . Planned surgery first 28 day treatment , except plan surgical removal treat lesion . Planned dentist appointment first 28 day treatment . Anticancer therapy within first 28 day treatment . Therapy drug induce light sensitivity ( e.g . tetracycline , sulfonamide , phenothiazine , sulfonylurea , hypoglycemic agent , thiazide diuretic , griseofulvin ) within first 14 day treatment . Coexisting ophthalmic disease likely require slitlamp examination within first 28 day treatment . History hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction . Previous cumulative dose Bleomycin receive 200 000 IE Known allergy sensitivity photosensitisers . Known allergy Cremophor . Known allergy bleomycin . Conditions contraindicate bleomycin treatment ( lung infection , impaired pulmonary function ) . Conditions worsen expose light ( include porphyria ) . Conditions associate risk poor protocol compliance . Pregnancy breastfeeding .</criteria>
