	<detailed_description>Obesity become grow significant public health problem . Evidence various national survey last 25 year show prevalence obesity overweight adult England increase threefold . There still clear evidence available explain epidemic level obesity . A number neuro-endocrine factor role regulation food intake control insulin secretion . We particularly interested measuring level hormone call Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) release intestine food absorb . This hormone turn influence production insulin another hormone , glucagon , involve control blood glucose ( 'blood sugar ' ) level appetite control . There evidence , obese people normal blood sugar control show attenuate GLP-1 level , however evidence contradictive statistical significance unclear . There ample evidence establish diabetes GLP-1 level attenuate , however still remain uncertain whether low GLP-1 level contribute pathogenesis condition consequence chronic hyperglycaemia hormonal metabolic change , though observation GLP-1 level low obese subject suggest possibility former may case . Recently Bournemouth Diabetes Emdocrine Centre ( BDEC ) conduct research trial effect weight loss GLP-1 level subject new onset type 2 diabetes . After 8 month intensive lifestyle programme average weight loss 7.8 kg significant sustain improvement clinical metabolic parameter . Despite , GLP-1 level remain unchanged . None previous study look gradual healthy lifestyle change sensible weight loss goal increase activity level effect GLP-1 level obese non-diabetic population .</detailed_description>
