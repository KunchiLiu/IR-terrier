	<criteria>1 . Male female subject 18 year age old symptomatic PAH despite treatment anticoagulant , calcium channel blocker , diuretic , cardiac glycoside , supplemental oxygen , endothelinreceptor antagonist and/or phosphodiesterase inhibitor . Endothelin receptor antagonist phosphodiesterase inhibitor must use stable dose 12 week screen . 2 . Subjects idiopathic PAH , familial pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH associate collagen vascular disease , correct congenital vitium ( congenital systemic pulmonary shunt surgically repair least five year ) anorexigen use . 3 . Diagnosis PAH establish accord standard criterion : 1 . Resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 25 mmHg . 2 . PVR &gt; 240 dyne s/cm5 . 3 . Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leave ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt; 15 mmHg . 4 . PVR &gt; 400 dyne s/cm5 . 5 . Two 6MWTs 150 500 ( inclusive ) variation 6MWT within Â± 15 % two test despite treatment PAH . Two 6MWT value need . Only one 6MWT perform screen confirmation eligibility 6MWT previously conduct within six week screen visit unless subject take another investigational drug participate specific training exercise programme time previous test . 6 . Subjects able willing refrain sunbathing , prolong sun exposure , solarium use , limit skin eye exposure sunlight use appropriate precaution ( protective clothing , sunscreen sunglass ) first dose 14 day study drug discontinuation . Subjects enter study follow reason : 1 . Subjects clinically unstable right heart failure within last three month ( NYHA Class IV ) . 2 . Subjects receive scheduled receive longterm treatment epoprostenol within three month screen . 3 . Hypotensive subject ( systemic systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg ) . 4 . Subjects PAH associate portal hypertension , Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection unrepaired congenital systemic pulmonary shunt . 5 . Subjects ventilationperfusion lung scan pulmonary angiography indicative thromboembolic disease . 6 . Subjects significant obstructive ( forced expiratory volume one second [ FEV1 ] /forced vital capacity [ FVC ] &lt; 70 % predict ) restrictive ( total lung capacity &lt; 70 % predict ) lung disease . 7 . In collagen vascular disease , subject significant interstitial disease ( FVC &lt; 70 % predict ) . 8 . Subjects evidence leave sided heart disease . 9 . Subjects moderate severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh B C ) . 10 .
