	<detailed_description>Background : Each year , Canadian emergency department physicians treat 600,000 patient head injury . Many adult `` minor head injury '' , i.e . loss consciousness amnesia Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score 13-15 . Only 6.2 % `` minor '' patient acute injury compute tomography ( CT scan ) 0.5 % epidural hematoma require surgery . Among Canadian teach hospital emergency department , show fourfold variation use CT small important number intracranial hematoma miss first visit . This renewal application build previous MRC/CIHR Health Services Research Committee fund grant determine feasibility ( phase 0 , MRC GR-13304D , 1995-96 ) , develop clinical decision rule CT minor head injury ( phase I , MRC MT-13700 , 1996-99 , N=3,121 ) , prospectively validate Canadian CT Head Rule ( phase II , CIHR # 42521 , 2000-03 , N=2,707 ) , part U Ottawa Group Grant Decision Support Techniques ( CIHR 2000-143 ) . The Canadian CT Head Rule comprise simple clinical variable allow physician much accurate diagnosis brain injury standardize use CT without jeopardize patient care ( The Lancet 2001 ) . In recently complete prospective validation ( phase II ) , confirm accuracy reliability rule 2,707 additional patient . Objectives : The goal phase III evaluate effectiveness safety active strategy implement Canadian CT Head Rule physician practice . Specific objective : 1 ) Determine clinical impact compare intervention control sit : ) CT Head order rate , b ) Missed neurological intervention case , c ) Missed brain injury , ) Number death , ) Length stay ED , e ) Patient satisfaction ; 2 ) Determine sustainability impact ; 3 ) Evaluate performance Canadian CT Head Rule , regard : ) Accuracy , b ) Physician accuracy interpretation , c ) Physician comfort compliance use ; 4 ) Conduct economic evaluation determine potential cost saving widespread implementation ; 5 ) Conduct exploratory psychological process evaluation examine whether physician ' intention behaviour predict . Methods : We propose matched-pair cluster design study compare outcomes 3 consecutive 12-month 'before ' , 'after ' , 'decay ' period 6 pair 'intervention ' 'control ' site . These 12 hospital ED sit stratify 'teaching ' 'community ' hospital , match accord baseline CT head order rate , allocate within pair either intervention control group . During 'after ' period intervention site , simple inexpensive strategy employ actively implement Canadian CT Head Rule : ) physician group discussion consensus , b ) educational initiative ( lecture , poster , pocket card ) , c ) process-of-care modification mandatory reminder Rule point requisition radiography . These outcome assess : 1 ) Measures clinical impact compare change 'before ' 'after ' intervention control sit : ) CT Head order proportion ( primary analysis ) ; b ) Number miss brain injury ; c ) Number serious adverse outcome ; ) Length stay ED ; e ) Patient satisfaction . 2 ) Performance Canadian CT Head Rule : ) Accuracy rule ; b ) Physician accuracy interpretation ; c ) Physician comfort compliance . 3 ) Economic evaluation measure : ) CT head rate discharge ; b ) Length stay ED hospital ; c ) Hospital admission ; ) Neurological intervention ; e ) Number transfer . 4 ) Psychological Process Evaluation : Mail survey physicians intervention . During 12-month 'decay ' period , implementation strategy continue , allow u evaluate sustainability effect . We estimate sample size 2,400 patient period order adequate power evaluate main outcome . Importance : This implementation study ( phase III ) essential step process develop new clinical decision rule / guideline health care practitioner . Phase I successfully derive Canadian CT Head Rule phase II confirm accuracy safety rule , hence , potential physician improve care . What remain unknown actual change clinical behaviour effect implementation Canadian CT Head Rule whether implementation achieve simple inexpensive measure . We believe Canadian CT Head Rule potential significantly limit health care cost improve efficiency patient flow busy Canadian EDs .</detailed_description>
