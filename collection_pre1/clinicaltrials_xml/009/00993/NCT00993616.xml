	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give belinostat together carboplatin work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer respond carboplatin cisplatin . Belinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving belinostat together carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belinostat Carboplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Did Not Respond Carboplatin Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate antitumor activity belinostat carboplatin patient persistent recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , measure objective response rate frequency progression- free survival 6 month . II . To determine nature degree toxicity belinostat combination carboplatin cohort patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive belinostat IV 30 minute day 1-5 carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients clinically respond , opinion physician , would continue benefit treatment may continue treatment beyond 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
