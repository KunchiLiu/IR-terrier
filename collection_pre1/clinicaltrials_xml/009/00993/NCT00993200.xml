	<brief_summary>Warfarin commonly use oral anticoagulant medicine ( blood thinner ) . Although medicine work well , difficult know much medicine patient need . Many thing affect much medicine patient need dose different patient patient . It important patient get right dose prevent clot bleed problem happen medicine dose low high . These problem life-threatening . To help find right dose , patient warfarin must frequent blood test measure well medicine work . The investigator know differences people 's gene affect much warfarin medicine someone need , n't yet know certainty use information make patient care decision . The hypothesis study use patient warfarin related genetic information incorporate computer algorithm use warfarin provider lead well warfarin management compare usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Medicine Interface Tool ( PerMIT ) : Warfarin : A Trial Comparing Usual Care Warfarin Initiation PerMIT Pharmacogenetic Guided Warfarin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Warfarin commonly use oral anticoagulant medication . Due difficulty determine individual 's proper warfarin dose , therapy typically initiated standard dose follow INR monitor frequent dose adjustment ensure medicine work properly . Unfortunately , therapeutic warfarin dos vary significantly patient patient , even standard dose lead excessive anticoagulation associate risk cause life-threatening hemorrhaging . Genetic non-genetic factor influence individual 's warfarin dose requirement response characteristic . There substantial evidence demonstrate clear gene-dose relationship . Although importance pharmacogenetics warfarin therapy understood , clear guidance information apply patient therapy woefully absent . The Personalized Medicine Interface Tool ( PerMIT ) software utility supply critical guidance model dose requirement response characteristic individual patient base genotypic physical characteristic . Using state-of-the-art multivariate computation , PerMIT calculate warfarin maintenance dose estimate also model influence repeat dose plasma drug concentration . Both genetic non-genetic factor ( age , weight gender ) influence warfarin dose requirement response characteristic individual . Recently , multi-variate mathematical equation , take account genetic non-genetic factor , age , weight gender , develop calculate estimate warfarin maintenance dose requirement ( Linder 2002 , Zhu 2007 , Sconce 2005 , Millican 2007 ) . The temporal response routine administration medication dictate clearance rate medication effective concentration , blood concentration dose interval require elicit desired pharmacologic effect . The clearance S-warfarin primarily dictate patient 's Cytochrome P4502C9 ( CYP2C9 ) genotype , whereas effective S-warfarin concentration primarily dictate patient 's vitamin K epoxide reductase complex protein 1 ( VKORC1 ) genotype ( Linder 2002 , Herman 2005 , Zhu 2007 ) . It well-known genetic variant CYP2C9 lead decrease S-warfarin metabolism ( clearance ) increase elimination half-life . The elimination half-life medication dictate time require repeat dose result reproducible drug concentration dose interval give dosage . This situation refer steady-state reliable time interpret dose-response relationship ( INR measurement ) . S-warfarin half-life estimate base individual 's CYP2C9 genotype ( Linder 2002 , Herman 2005 , Loebstein 2001 ) steady-state concentration S-warfarin optimal anti-coagulation condition closely related patient 's VKORC1 genotype ( Zhu 2007 ) . PerMIT : Warfarin clear theoretical benefit demonstrate accurate ; however , prospective randomize control clinical trial require demonstrate efficacy PerMIT : Warfarin software comparison standard care . We design two-arm , prospective randomize control trial directly assess efficacy PerMIT : Warfarin ( ) identify patient ' optimal dose requirement ; ( b ) reduce patient ' time achieve stable therapy ; ( c ) reduce frequency out-of-range INR measurement ; ( ) reduce number dose adjustment . This study evaluate whether , degree , PerMIT : Warfarin improve patient care outcome , extension , reduces risk adverse drug reaction compare patient receive therapy base standard care .</detailed_description>
