	<brief_summary>Background : - Vaccines substance use try create resistance immunity disease prevent infection . Investigators look improved way give test result different kind vaccine . - Researchers interested compare result experimental DNA vaccine prevention seasonal influenza standard FDA-approved vaccine prevention seasonal influenza . The experimental DNA vaccine yet approve FDA prevent flu . Objectives : - To test safety immune response experimental DNA vaccine seasonal influenza , compare standard vaccine seasonal influenza . Eligibility : - Healthy individual age 45 70 yet receive seasonal influenza vaccine . Design : - Participants six plan clinic visit ( Weeks 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 27 ) two telephone follow-up contact ( within 2 day injection ) study . - Participants divide two group : one group receive two standard ( TIV ) flu vaccine injection give use needle syringe , receive DNA flu vaccine use needleless injection system follow TIV vaccine . - The vaccine injection group give approximately 3 week apart , - Clinic staff observe participant least 30 minute vaccination . One two day injection , participant must telephone clinic staff , 7 day vaccination participant keep diary card report possible side effect . - During study visit , blood sample collect research purpose test response vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 309 : A Multi-Center , Open-Label , Randomized Phase I Study Investigational Influenza DNA Vaccine Followed 2009/2010 Seasonal Influenza Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine ( TIV ) Compared Two Injections TIV Adults 45-70 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I , open-label study healthy adult . The study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost vaccination regimen seasonal influenza virus one dose investigational plasmid DNA vaccine prime follow 3 week later seasonal influenza trivalent inactivate vaccine ( TIV ) boost compare two injection seasonal TIV . The hypothesis DNA vaccine safe administration DNA vaccine prime - TIV boost schedule elicit great frequency and/or magnitude antibody response two injection seasonal TIV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability prime boost vaccine regimen . Secondary exploratory objective relate evaluation major difference quantity , quality durability humoral cellular immune response . Product Description : The VRC-FLUDNA056-00-VP vaccine develop manufactured VRC , NIAID . It compose 3 closed-circular DNA plasmid , CMV/R promoter , encode H1 , H3 , influenza B hemagglutinin ( HA ) proteins 2009-2010 influenza vaccine strain . DNA vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL dose administer 1 mL volume . The TIV subunit inactivate vaccine 2009-2010 season . Each dose compose 45 microg hemagglutinin ( HA ) 0.5 mL ; recommend ratio 15 microg HA follow 3 strain : A/Brisbane/59/2007-like ( H1N1 ) ; A/Brisbane/10/2007-like ( H3N2 ) ; B/Brisbane/60/2008-like . All injection administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle . The DNA injection administer Biojector [ Registered Trademark ] 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System TIV needle syringe . Subjects : 60 healthy adult , 45-70 year old enrol . Study Plan : There two group study randomize simultaneously ratio 2:1 schedule show schema . All subject receive seasonal influenza TIV vaccine second injection . The protocol require 6 clinic visit ( Weeks 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 27 ) 2 telephone follow-up contact ( within 2 day injection ) group .</detailed_description>
