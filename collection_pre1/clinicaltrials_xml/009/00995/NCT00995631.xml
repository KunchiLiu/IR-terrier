	<brief_summary>The typical female pattern accumulate fat hip thigh long think confer less risk disease typical male abdominal fat pattern . However , leg fat may simply benign respect disease risk , may fact protect cardiovascular disease risk . Although mechanism unknown , investigator hypothesize remove portion important fat depot ( via liposuction ) could increase disease risk . Such unfavorable result may may transient depend individual 's ability defend fat mass . Because sex hormone appear play role regional fat accumulation , investigator hypothesize estrogen-deficient postmenopausal woman may augment abdominal fat accumulation attenuate hip thigh re-accumulation compare premenopausal woman follow lipectomy compare non-surgical control . As result , increase abdominal fat accumulation may worsen disease risk postmenopausal woman . Menopause-related difference fat storage baseline also expect determine degree lipectomy alters disease risk propensity AT re-accumulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Following Lipectomy Understand Adipose Tissue Re-accumulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipectomy frequently perform aesthetic surgery U.S. today consider permanent , The American Society Aesthetic Plastic Surgery , long term follow-up study do verify assertion . Indeed , animal study suggest rapid adipose tissue ( AT ) re-accumulation lipectomy common may even accompany unfavorable change disease risk . Recent study human focus abdominal lipectomy mean reduce metabolic disease risk obese premenopausal woman . However , none study evaluate AT re-accumulation report long-term ( &gt; 6 mo ) change metabolic outcome , none evaluate effect remove femoral AT despite common site lipectomy woman despite apparent cardioprotective benefit lower body adiposity . Further , none study include postmenopausal woman increase risk abdominal AT accumulation . It investigator 's overall working hypothesis removal femoral AT lipectomy may worsen metabolic disease risk ( measure postprandial lipemia ) estrogen-deficient postmenopausal woman , contrast premenopausal woman , accumulate AT abdominal rather femoral region . The global aim study determine whether : 1 ) menopause-related difference regional ( abdominal vs. femoral ) AT re-accumulation follow lipectomy ; 2 ) change ( removal regain ) femoral AT mass alter postprandial triglyceride clearance storage meal-derived fatty acid . Further , investigator postulate menopause-related difference postprandial lipemia handle dietary fatty acid determine degree femoral lipectomy worsen parameter . Pre- postmenopausal woman ( n=80 ) randomly assign either femoral lipectomy control ( surgery ) . All eligible volunteer undergo test begin study 2 , 8 , 14 month follow lipectomy . Measurements include body composition assessment , meal test AT biopsy assess lipectomy-related change : 1 ) abdominal femoral fat mass ; 2 ) systemic postprandial triglyceride excursion ; 3 ) storage dietary fatty acid AT . These study design evaluate effect femoral lipectomy regional AT re-accumulation metabolic disease risk pre- postmenopausal woman .</detailed_description>
