	<brief_summary>The Phase 1 trial single-center , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging out-patient study design provide first clinical data safety , tolerability immunogenicity XRX-001 inactivate yellow fever vaccine 60 healthy male female volunteer , 18-49 year age . Subjects receive two inoculation one two dose level XRX-001 vaccine . A control group receive placebo . Safety determine incidence severity adverse event treatment group combine cohort double blind treatment period 42 day post-vaccination . Subjects also followed-up 3 , 6 12 month determine severe adverse event ( SAEs ) change health status . Efficacy assess neutralize antibody response vaccine . The co-primary immunogenicity endpoint dose-response analysis seroconversion rate ( fourfold great increase neutralize antibody titer baseline Day 42 ) 50 % plaque reduction neutralization test ( PRNT50 ) geometric mean titer ( GMT ) Day 42 . Secondary immunogenicity endpoint include : 1 . The seroconversion rate GMT neutralize antibody titer dose group combine Days 21 42 . 2 . The reverse cumulative distribution curve antibody titer Days 21 42 dose group dose group combine 3 . The duration antibody titer display seroconversion rate GMT across time-points Month 12 , treatment group dose group combine .</brief_summary>
