	<brief_summary>Background : - The Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases conduct research investigate swine flu ( H1N1 ) vaccine affect immune system . The exposure new swine flu vaccine give u rare opportunity learn human immune system respond new vaccine . - Researchers interested collect blood sample individual receive vaccine . Participants select group healthy volunteer receive H1N1 vaccine mandatory work National Institutes Health . This protocol one first study characterize human innate immune response H1N1 vaccine . Objectives : - To collect blood sample research purpose participant receive standard non-research vaccination swine flu ( H1N1 ) . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 year age old employee National Institutes Health . - Individuals confirm case influenza past year eligible participate . Design : - Participants admit 36-hour inpatient stay , blood sample take frequently . Participants standard intravenous catheter ( similar one use intravenous infusion ) put place avoid multiple needle stick . - Participants assign one two group ; two group differ time blood draw overall amount blood drawn . - Group 1 : Blood sample 30 minute immediately vaccination . Additional sample take 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 hour vaccination . - Group 2 : Blood sample 30 minute immediately vaccination . Additional sample take follow 36 hour , exact timing determine base finding group 1 . - All participant provide blood sample 7 day release inpatient stay . - Because amount blood drawn research , participant donate blood take part protocol collect blood participating study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Innate Immune Response Healthy NIH Employees Baseline After Immunization With H1N1 Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seasonal influenza major health problem whose impact typically reduce vaccination . The H1N1 ( swine flu ) influenza virus emerge pathogen potential cause devastate morbidity mortality come month . In June 2009 , World Health Organization declare H1N1 outbreak global pandemic . At present limited data early non-specific ( innate ) immune response adult recipient H1N1 vaccine . Therefore Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases propose protocol design investigate early innate immune response . Healthy adult subject ( NIH employee ) admit inpatient receive FDA-licensed H1N1 vaccine follow serial blood draw . These sample use perform comprehensive detailed analysis innate immune system response vaccination . To knowledge , protocol first study characterize human innate immune response H1N1 vaccine . This information may useful design new , effective vaccine prevent spread H1N1 . The primary objective collect blood use strictly laboratory study design characterize innate immune response H1N1 vaccine . Samples collect healthy adult volunteer ( NIH employee ) baseline serially first 36 hour vaccination H1N1 vaccine .</detailed_description>
