	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Efficacy Civamide Osteoarthritis ( OA ) Knee ( )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To ensure subject investigator remain blinded , follow design employ : 1 . Subject Blinding : Randomization Subjects blind assignment placebo active study drug : One half subject randomize Civamide Cream 0.075 % applied Target Knee 3 time daily 84 day ( 12 week ) . The half randomized Placebo Cream apply Target Knee 3 time daily 84 day ( 12 week ) . As Civamide Cream 0.075 % Placebo Cream initially produce burn sting subject , blind treatment assignment maintain . As study progress , frequency burn sting Civamide Cream 0.075 % Placebo Cream expect substantially decrease similar . 2 . Investigator Blinding : Separate Raters To maintain blind , two separate study staff raters : Efficacy Rater Physician must physician-investigator evaluate efficacy parameter . The Safety Rater Physician must also physician-investigator evaluate safety parameter . A physician-investigator defined physician list Principal Investigator Sub-Investigator Form FDA 1572 . Each may assign designee ( another appropriately train study staff member ) perform study procedure ( define Section 8.0 Appendix E , Study Staff Responsibility Chart ) . Study Periods : See Study Flow Chart Schedule Observations . Screening Period ( Day -3 ) : The following procedure conduct : Obtain informed consent ; ass eligibility accord selection criterion ; collect demographic data , medical history , osteoarthritis history diagnosis , prior current medication information . Perform physical examination obtain vital sign laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology &amp; urinalysis ) . Female subject child-bearing potential give urine pregnancy test . The subject complete Screening Pain Scale knee . Either Rater Physician determine subject 's Functional Capacity Classification . If subject eligible , ( i.e. , Screening Pain Subscale score ≥ 9 one knee , subject regular , significant pain due OA condition knee , Functional Capacity Classification score I-III ) Efficacy Rater Physician Safety Rater Physician identify knee joint severe symptom OA `` Target Knee '' . The subject must x-ray radiographic report available within last 3 year order meet Selection Criteria . If subject prior x-ray radiographic report x-ray Target Knee obtain . Baseline/Randomization Period ( Day 1 ) Either Rater Physician review laboratory test x-ray result Target Knee prior randomization confirm subject 's continued eligibility include compliance stability oral NSAIDs/COX-2 medication prior randomization . Subjects complete another Screening Pain Scale confirm Target Knee score &gt; 9 . If eligible , subject randomize Double-Blind Treatment Period . If Screening Pain Scale score less 9 , subject may return within 14 day first clinic visit ( Visit 1/Day -3 ) repeat . If eligible time , schedule Baseline procedure perform complete . Eligible subject complete WOMAC OA Index , Subject 's Global Evaluation , SF-36® Health Survey . Subjects apply first dose study drug clinic . They send home diary complete everyday , study drug apply Target Knee three time daily . Treatment Period ( Days 1-84 ) : The subject complete WOMAC OA Index Subject 's Global Evaluation clinic visit Days 1 , 21 , 42 , 63 84 ( Day 3 ) . Concurrent medication , adverse event , study drug compliance review record Safety Rater Physician designee throughout Treatment Period clinic visit Days 3 , 21 , 42 , 63 84 ( End-of-Study/Final Visit ) . Also Day 84 ( End-of-Study/Final Visit ) , subject complete SF-36® Health Survey , Efficacy Rater Physician determine Functional Capacity Classification , Safety Rater Physician designee complete final set vital sign collect laboratory sample . The Safety Rater Physician perform complete physical examination subject review laboratory result available . Safety Rater Physician designee contact subject phone Days 15 , 36 , 57 78 ass subject compliance study drug application , maintenance concurrent medication , include stable dose NSAIDS COX-2 inhibitor , review adverse event experience , determine subject enough study drug last next visit , remind subject next schedule clinic visit . On Day 84 ( End-of-Study/Final Visit ) subject discharge procedure complete .</detailed_description>
