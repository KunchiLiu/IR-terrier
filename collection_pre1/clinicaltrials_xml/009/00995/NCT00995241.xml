	<brief_title>Pilot Study Compare Pharmacokinetics Parameters Plasma Intracellular Raltegravir Administered Once Day Adult Patients Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV integrase enzyme responsible transfer DNA encode HIV host chromosome , necessary step replication retroviruses . Raltegravir ( RAL ) first integrase inhibitor approve HIV treatment patient infected virus . RAL demonstrate marked antiretroviral activity HIV strain resistant antiretroviral drug family high virological efficacy patient pre-treated na√Øve antiretroviral treatment . In addition , safety profile favourable . Unlike happens antiretrovirals protease inhibitor , relationship virological response antiretroviral treatment RAL trough concentration drug plasma . Similarly , vitro study show , infection culture cell , rate viral replication measure p24 antigen production continue inhibit even RAL wash culture medium 8 hour infection , suggest possibility post-antibiotic effect drug . Either way , case transcriptase inhibitor nucleoside analogue , lack correlation pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics RAL may result intracellular accumulation drug blood lymphocytes peripheral , turn could explain either set RAL pre-integration complex saturation certain cellular transporter responsible pump RAL inside out-cell ( efflux transporter ) . Anyway , result would great RAL intracellular half-life plasmatic , would translate clinically persistent antiretroviral effect compare concentration plasma . Based possible suggest average life RAL longer peripheral blood lymphocyte plasma , intracellular increase half-life could explain absence relationship trough RAL concentration virological efficacy , post-antibiotic effect RAL find study vitro , hand , could relevant possible once-daily administration raltegravir .</detailed_description>
