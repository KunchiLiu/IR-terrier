	<brief_title>Sub-study Spinal Cord Stimulation Restore Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cervical thoracic spinal cord injury often paralysis major portion expiratory muscle — muscle responsible cough — therefore , lack normal cough mechanism . Consequently , patient suffer markedly reduce ability clear airway secretion , factor contributes development recurrent respiratory tract infection pneumonia bronchitis . In fact , pneumonia major cause death patient population . In recent clinical trial , show expiratory muscle electrically activate spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) , technique involve surgical placement disc electrodes surface spinal cord . This method successful achieve effective mean expiratory muscle activation , demonstrate generation large airway pressure peak airflow rate . Importantly , SCS facilitate secretion removal , reduces need caregiver support , reduces incidence respiratory tract infection improve life quality . This method therefore potential reduce health care cost improve survival spinal cord injure subject . The purpose trial directly compare activation expiratory muscle use wire electrode , insert percutaneously needle , previously employ disc electrode . In trial , researcher study 6 adult ( 18-70 year old ) spinal injury ( T5 level high ) , least 12 month follow date injury . After evaluation include medical history , brief physical examination , initial testing , participant undergo surgical procedure implant small electrode ( metal disc ) surface spinal cord lower back stimulate expiratory muscle restore cough . Prior permanent implantation system , wire disc electrode compare assess degree expiratory muscle activation electrode type . The disc electrodes permanently implant , allow participant use fully function stimulation system restore effective cough .</detailed_description>
