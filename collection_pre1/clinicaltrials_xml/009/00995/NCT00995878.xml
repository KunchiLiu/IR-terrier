	<brief_summary>The primary goal study compare safety effectiveness two standard fibroid treatment : MRI guide ultrasound surgery ( MRgFUS ) uterine artery embolization ( UAE ) . Both treatment approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) woman plan become pregnant . A second goal study well understand symptom bother woman fibroid . Understanding address symptoms clinically-significant uterine fibroid important order optimize treatment outcome control health care cost . Women eligible participate study , randomize one two treatment arm ( UAE MRgFUS ) . Women arm receive treatment able choose treatment receive . A comprehensive assessment symptoms-including experience pain- take place baseline , 6 week , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month follow treatment UAE MRgFUS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The FIRSTT : Comparing MRgFUS ( MR-guided Focused Ultrasound ) Versus UAE ( Uterine Artery Embolization ) Uterine Fibroids .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroid affect 70 80 % woman 30 % woman symptomatic . Over 200,000 hysterectomy perform year uterine fibroid USA . The direct health care cost attributable uterine fibroid exceed $ 2.1 billion annually . Fibroids report cause number symptom include heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding , pelvic pressure , pain menses bowel bladder dysfunction . However , fibroid symptomatology incompletely understood . Understanding address myoma pain important optimizing treatment outcomes control health care cost societal perspective . This study propose optimally characterize symptom symptom relief woman leiomyomas severe enough seek interventional therapy . Secondly characterize variety symptom utilize standardized instrument pelvic disease symptom optimize comparison disease process . Clinical scientific significance study high . We look generate resource use later time assess biologic genetic variable affect treatment outcome comprehensively assess societal economic impact uterine fibroid treatment UAE MRgFUS . Participants study 36 month follow fibroid treatment .</detailed_description>
