	<detailed_description>- Intracranial hypertension severe complication severe head injury . This may lead cerebral death severe neurological outcome . To improve prognosis patient , intracranial pressure must maintain normal range maintain cerebral perfusion pressure . Among numerous strategy , osmotherapy frequently propose decrease intracranial pressure , use mannitol hypertonic saline . Recently , find hypertonic sodium lactate infusion efficient decrease intracranial hypertension compare equivalent volemic osmotic mannitol administration.Thus , hypothesize preventive sodium lactate infusion severe head trauma could decrease number intracranial hypertensive episode . - Methods Objectives : compare randomize double-blind fashion two group patient , i.e. , receive standard isotonic saline infusion ( control group ) receive half-molar sodium lactate 48 hour follow admission ICU . The primary endpoint number treatment require control intracranial hypertensive episode occur first 48 hour follow admission ICU . Secondary endpoint effect sodium lactate infusion : intracranial pressure evolution ; neurological outcome 6 month ( glasgow outcome scale ) ; cerebral blood flow evaluate transcranial doppler ; daily water balance - Protocol consisted measure soon possible baseline intracranial pressure cerebral perfusion pressure , immediately begin administration 0.5 ml/kg/h intravenous isotonic saline perfusion half-molar sodium lactate 48 hour randomize double-blind fashion . Management patient patient . Treatment require intracranial hypertensive episode decide senior physician charge patient . Sample size calculate consider 50 % patient develop least one intracranial hypertensive episode , require least 2 treatment . Based previous result , hypothesized sodium lactate decrease number require treatment 2 , lead sample size 30 patient per group - Follow : 48 hour treatment intracranial hypertensive episode ; 6 month neurological outcome ( glasgow outcome scale )</detailed_description>
