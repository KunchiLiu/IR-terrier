	<brief_summary>The goal project develop test new robotic system accommodate practice task require reach , grasp release object . Our previous work show MIME robot safe effective improve reach stroke subject . But adequate control hand movement critical functional upper limb , often resistant conventional therapeutic intervention . Many stroke survivor residual ability flex finger , extension often limit impeded increase passive stiffness flexor , abnormal level increase tone flexor weakness extensor . In recent study , 38 % stroke survivor report impaired hand function disable motor impairment face .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension MIME Robotic System Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design : We hypothesize : 1 ) Gains proximal arm function ( shoulder , elbow ) immediately robotic training great dose-matched conventional therapy ; 2 ) Unlike previous study , gain hand function immediately robotic training great dose-matched conventional therapy . Methodology : In first year study , develop robotic system ability assist hand movement . Since many stroke survivor subacute chronic recovery stage residual ability flex finger severely limited finger extension , build hand exoskeleton apply precise extension force digit hand . This exoskeleton integrate ARMin III arm exoskeleton task arm reach , grasp object release object train . In last 2 year project , perform pilot clinical trial compare new train paradigm dose-matched conventional therapy chronic stroke survivor . Outcome measure take train immediately training .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>An ischemic hemorrhagic stroke 6 month prior entry study ; trace ability move wrist finger extension ; voluntary shoulder elevation approximately 45 deg ; age 21 90 . Have cognitive deficit could negatively affect ability complete protocol evidence score 24 less Folstein Mini Mental State Examination ( Bleeker , 1988 ) ; excessive pain joint affect extremity could limit ability cooperate protocol ; upper extremity injury condition prior stroke could limit participation ; sever hemispatial neglect . full score 24 distal section FuglMyer test ( FM ) ( FuglMeyer 1975 ) ; severe sensory loss .</criteria>
