	<brief_title>The Effects Corticosteroids , Glucose Control , Depth-of-Anesthesia Perioperative Inflammation Morbidity From Major Non-cardiac Surgery ( Dexamethasone , Light Anesthesia Tight Glucose Control ( DeLiT Trial ) )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The perioperative period characterize intense inflammatory response mark elevated concentration inflammatory marker like C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) . This response link increased perioperative morbidity mortality . Available evidence suggest blunt inflammatory response surgical trauma might improve perioperative outcome . The putative benefit blunt surgical stress response likely great high-risk patient major non-cardiac surgery . We study three intervention potentially modulate perioperative inflammation , corticosteroid , tight glucose control light anesthesia effect major morbidity mortality result major non-cardiac surgery . Steroids powerful routinely available anti-inflammatory drug . They decrease perioperative concentration inflammatory marker improve outcome cardiac abdominal surgery . Poorly control blood glucose worsen inflammatory response surgery . Hyperglycemia impair wound healing , increase infection risk , increase overall hospital mortality , increase risk perioperative renal failure , augments transfusion requirement . Treatment hyperglycemia show improve outcome decrease mortality cardiac patient . Also critically ill patient , decrease inflammatory marker , overall hospital mortality 34 % , blood stream infection 46 % , acute renal failure 41 % . Cumulative deep hypnotic time associate increase one-year all-cause mortality , possibly aggravation inflammatory response surgery . In contrast , avoidance deep anesthesia appear reduce postoperative CRP level , risk nausea vomiting , well postoperative hemodynamic , respiratory infectious complication . Evidence thus suggest steroid administration , tight glucose control , avoidance deep anesthesia may decrease perioperative morbidity reduce inflammatory response surgery . Using three-way factorial approach , thus propose test primary hypothesis major perioperative morbidity reduce : 1 ) low-dose dexamethasone ; 2 ) intensive perioperative glucose control ; , 3 ) light anesthesia . Secondary hypothesis include intervention reduces circulate concentration inflammatory marker CRP , correlation CRP post-operative complication . Anesthetic sensitivity predict major minor complication , delirium Other secondary hypothesis intervention , reduces minor surgical complication , reduces postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , reduce postoperative delirium , speed hospital discharge , improve quality life ( SF-12v2 Health Survey , Christensen 's VAS fatigue score ) , reduce all-cause one-year mortality .</detailed_description>
