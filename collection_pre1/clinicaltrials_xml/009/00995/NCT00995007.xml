	<brief_summary>Background : - Growth new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) provide many tumor , include brain tumor , need nutrient oxygen cancer cell survive . One possible treatment different kind cancer involve treatment drug slow stop angiogenesis prevent tumor growth . - Vandetanib oral medication know block angiogenesis show significant antitumor activity laboratory animal study . Vandetanib appear well tolerated patient specific daily dos . - Carboplatin drug interrupt division cancer cell show useful drug treatment tumor know glioma . It useful drug treat brain tumor , researcher interest gather information work treatment patient respond initial surgery , radiation , chemotherapy . Objective : - To determine safety effectiveness vandetanib carboplatin , give together sequentially , recurrent high-grade glioma . Eligibility : - Adults diagnose malignant glioma receive standard treatment longer appear effective . Design : - Patients assign one two group . Group 1 patient ( combination group ) receive oral vandetanib 28 day intravenous ( IV ) carboplatin ( begin 28-day cycle ) . Group 2 patient ( sequential group ) receive IV carboplatin alone ( begin 28-day cycle ) oral vandetanib ( 300 mg daily ) 28 day tumor grow patient develops unacceptable carboplatin toxicity . - Treatment continue 28-day cycle 1 year group . - Patients undergo number test procedures treatment cycle , include physical examination , routine laboratory test , electrocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan - At end 1 year treatment , patient reevaluate possible continuation drug therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase II Trial Vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) Combination With Carboplatin Versus Carboplatin Alone Followed Vandetanib Alone Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In vivo experiment document ability vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) inhibit tumor growth various preclinical tumor model . Given pronounced neovasculature associate malignant glioma , abundant publish data demonstrate dependence glioma growth maintenance proliferation neovasculature , vandetanib represent potentially promising new therapeutic approach otherwise refractory tumor . Phase II data vandetanib recurrent glioblastoma conduct National Institutes Health show promising activity response usually short-lasting . Carboplatin show activity monotherapy treatment recurrent malignant glioma adult preclinical data generate Dr . Fines ' laboratory demonstrate additive anti-glioma activity vandetanib . The safety profile carboplatin preclinical clinical data support use combination vandetanib patient malignant glioma . Vandetanib also epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor demonstrate presence EGFRvIII mutant and/or presence intact phosphatase tensin homolog delete chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) non-phosphorylated protein kinase B ( AKT ) predict high likelihood response EGFR inhibitor Tarceva Iressa . Objectives : To establish data regard anti-tumor activity vandetanib combination carboplatin single agent carboplatin collect information regard spectrum toxicity . To determine presence EGFRvIII mutant and/or presence intact PTEN non-phosphorylated AKT predict high likelihood response vandetanib . Eligibility : Patients histologically prove malignant glioma eligible study . Design : Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) one two group . Patients group one treat vandetanib ( 300 mg daily patient enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) 400 mg daily patient EIAEDs ) carboplatin ( area concentration-time curve steady-state [ area curve ( AUC ) ] , 6mg/mL x min ) every 4-week cycle ( combination group ) . Patients group two receive carboplatin alone ( AUC 6mg/mL x min ) every 4-week cycle . Patients develop tumor progression unacceptable toxicity carboplatin alone ( group 2 ) receive single agent vandetanib ( 300 mg daily patient enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) 400 mg daily patient EIAEDs ) 4-week cycle ( sequential group ) . A total 128 evaluable patient analyze . The total accrual ceiling allow 74 patient enrol glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) stratum 74 patient anaplastic glioma ( AG ) stratum ( total 148 ) factor replace patient come treatment prior cycle 1 .</detailed_description>
