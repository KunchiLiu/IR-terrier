	<brief_summary>Anesthetic preconditioning ( APC , brief exposure anesthetic gas ) become area intense research interest ability protect tissue organ injury result cessation blood flow re-establishment flow . The blood vessel lining play key role injury . This research examine , human volunteer , several important modifier APC human blood vessel : high blood sugar , vitamin C , statin drug . Thus , propose study advance investigator ' understand mechanisms injury human explore important modifier APC protection injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injury vital organ tissue occur blood flow stop re-established . This happen variety clinical situation contribute poor outcome . A new concept protection injury anesthetic drug might occur effect volatile anesthetic tissue line blood vessel . Thus , brief exposure volatile anesthetic cessation blood flow , call anesthetic preconditioning ( APC ) , substantially reduce result injury line blood vessel . In animal model , high level blood sugar block protection , cholesterol lower drug ( statin ) restore protection may independently protect blood vessel line injury . The interaction high blood sugar statin drug blood vessel reaction APC subsequent 20-min cessation blood flow forearm study human . In addition , involvement reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) harmful effect high blood sugar beneficial effect statin explore . The following four hypothesis study : 1 ) high blood sugar block anesthetic protection blood vessel injury dose time dependent manner ; 2 ) reactive oxygen specie involve inhibition APC high blood sugar ; 3 ) statin modulate injury dose related manner ; 4 ) statin reduce high blood sugar inhibition APC . A standard model evaluate forearm blood vessel function use . Thin rubber-band-like strain gauge strap around forearm change stretch variety intervention experimental arm ( arm receive intervention control arm ) measure . These intervention allow investigator determine whether hypothesis list true . During study , 20-min arrest forearm circulation . Additional effect injury , APC , high blood sugar , statin determine evaluate blood vessel inflammatory responses `` marker '' blood sample take I/R injury . Several study involve vary forearm blood glucose concentration brief ( 30 min ) longer ( 2 hour ) period prior APC injury . The ROS scavenger vitamin C use evaluate role ROS adverse effect high blood sugar . There several study continue seek mechanism action effect via use drug interaction .</detailed_description>
