	<brief_summary>The rationale phase II study biweekly docetaxel cisplatin patient unresectable NSCLC follow : First , optimal dose schedule combination docetaxel cisplatin still controversial ( 3 weekly versus weekly ) . Platinum-based combination chemotherapy improve survival patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) first-line setting . Combination chemotherapy docetaxel cisplatin one standard platinum-based regimen treat NSCLC . However , usual standard 3 weekly regimen docetaxel cisplatin consistently produce frequent Grade 3-4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia . Although weekly docetaxel cisplatin well tolerate chemotherapy every 3 week , especially first line set term myelosuppression , optimal dose schedule administration two drug yet determine . Both 3-weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin weekly schedule show similar response rate different toxicity profile . The frequent grade 3 4 toxicity neutropenia 3 weekly schedule fatigue asthenia weekly schedule . Second , docetaxel cisplatin different action mechanism . Docetaxel show characteristic early bone marrow suppression 5-7 day infusion compare usual 14 day infusion cisplatin . Thus , nadir period overlap investigator administer drug concomittantly . Third , many feasible report biweekly administration docetaxel patient NSCLC , breast cancer , stomach cancer , ovarian cancer well safety profile . Therefore , investigator design phase II study evaluate efficacy toxicity biweekly schedule docetaxel cisplatin patient unresectable NSCLC test hypothesis biweekly schedule docetaxel cisplatin well tolerate standard 3 week weekly schedule term hematologic ( neutropenia ) non-hematologic toxicity ( asthenia , interstitial pneumonitis . Additionally investigator evaluate polymorphism associate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design following : The sample size calculate accord Simon 's two stage optimal design . Assuming response rate 40 % , probability error 5 % power 80 % , total 48 patient ( 43 patient plus 5 patient compensate 10 % drop-out rate ) enrol . In initial stage , 13 evaluable patient enter study evaluate response . If ≥ 3 response observe first stage , 30 additional patient enter second stage . The statistical evaluation perform base intention to-treat analysis . The combination chemotherapy consist docetaxel 40mg/m2 1-hour infusion follow cisplatin 40mg/m2 30-minutes intravenous infusion drug give day 1 , 15 outpatient setting . Patients also receive adequate hydration least 1,500ml half saline normal saline cisplatin administration . All patient receive antiemetic therapy consist intravenous 5-HT3 antagonist dexamethasone docetaxel administration . The treatment cycle repeat every 4 week maximum six cycle . The patient whose absolute neutrophil count platelet count great equal 1.500 100,000/mm3 , respectively , low equal grade 1 non-hematologic toxicity ( exclude alopecia ) receive chemotherapy day 1 cycle . On day 15 cycle , minimum requirement receive chemotherapy absolute neutrophil count 1000 1,500/mm3 , platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 grade ≥2 nonhematologic toxicity ( exclude alopecia ) . If condition meet day 1 , 15 , chemotherapy postpone 1 week . A delay 3 week result withdrawal study . If grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity nadir previous cycle , febrile neutropenia without documented infection , administration drug subsequent cycle reduce 25 % plan dose . The Administration granulocyte-colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) allow presence febrile neutropenia , grade 3 4 neutropenia . In presence grade 3 4 non-hematologic toxicity ( except nausea , vomit alopecia ) , treatment postpone resolution toxicity drug dos reduce 25 % next cycle . Treatment stop time documented disease progression , unacceptable toxicity accord patient 's refusal . The pretreatment baseline evaluation include complete medical history physical examination , complete blood cell count ( CBC ) differential , chemistry profile performance status . Chest X-rays , chest upper abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) scan , brain CT scan magnetic resonance imaging , radionuclide bone scan diagnostic procedure perform clinically indicate . During treatment , limited history taking , physical examination , assessment toxicity , complete blood cell count differential blood chemistry test repeat weekly . A chest X-ray perform every 4 week cycle . Appropriate image study , include CT scan chest upper abdomen , perform every two cycle assess treatment response , sooner need documenting disease progression . The objective tumor response assess accord RECIST criterion . The response rate calculate ratio number patient achieve complete partial response number enrol patient . Overall survival ( OS ) Time progression ( TTP ) calculate start therapy death progression , respectively , last follow-up . Toxicities evaluate accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI-CTC ) scale version 3.0 .</detailed_description>
