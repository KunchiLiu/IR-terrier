	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety tolerability investigational multi-dose inhaled flu medication , CS-8958 . Study participant include 16 male female , age 18-55 year age , inclusive . Participants divide two treatment group ( Groups A B ) group consist 8 subject . Participants involve study related procedure maximum 14 week initial screen follow visit . 6 subject Group A administer 40 mg CS-8958 drug two subject receive placebo ( substance contain medication ) , week six week . In Group B six subject administer 40 mg CS-8958 drug two subject receive placebo , twice week six week . Study procedure include blood urine sample , ECGs ( measure heart activity ) , blood pressure , pulse rate functional oxygen saturation arterial hemoglobin . Also continuous cardiac telemetry perform well physical examination spirometry assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetic Study Multiple Doses CS-8958</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza acute febrile illness cause influenza A B virus affect age groups.Influenza occur annually year estimate influenza epidemic cause 36,000 death 114,000 hospitalization US alone . Control human influenza virus infection continue major public health goal.Influenza infect respiratory tract rapid onset symptom typically characterize fever , chill , myalgia , headache , malaise , sore throat cough . Influenza infection generally self-limiting ; however significant morbidity mortality occur , predominantly high risk group elderly suffer chronic condition . It objective clinical trial investigate safety tolerability multiple dose CS-8958 administer via inhalation healthy adult subject . The pharmacokinetics require dose regimen achievable inhalation delivery . Study participant include 16 male female , age 18-55 year age , inclusive . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability 40mg CS-8958 twice week ( consecutive day ) 6 week healthy adult subject multiple dos administer via inhalation . The secondary objective ass systemic exposure CS-8958 active metabolite R-125489 single multiple dos CS-8958 healthy adult subject . Participants divide two treatment group ( Groups A B ) group consist 8 subject . Participants involve study related procedure maximum 14 week initial screen follow visit . 6 subject Group A administer 40 mg CS-8958 drug two subject receive placebo ( substance contain medication , week six week . In Group B six subject administer 40 mg CS-8958 drug two subject receive placebo , twice week six week . Adverse event record every visit . Vital sign include blood pressure , pulse rate functional oxygen saturation arterial hemoglobin measure admission , pre-dose multiple time point post dose . ECGs perform admission , pre-dose multiple time point post dose.Continuous cardiac telemetry perform 24 hour post first dose week cohort A 60 hour post first dose week cohort B. Spirometry assessment include forced vital capacity , force expiratory volume 1 second , force expiratory volume percentage 1 second , force expiratory flow rate , peak expiratory flow rate perform admission , pre-dose multiple time point post dose . Physical examination perform Day -1 final visit ( need subject develop symptomatology ) . Blood sample hematology biochemistry assessment take admission , 24 hour post dose week . Urine sample urinalysis test collect admission , 24 hour post dose week . Blood sample pharmacokinetic test take pre-dose multiple time point post dose . The Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) review safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic data Cohort A prior begin Cohort B .</detailed_description>
