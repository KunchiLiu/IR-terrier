	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate efficacy reinforce versus standard follow-up care utility follow-up CEA assessment patient fully resect stage II III colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This multinational/multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 follow-up arm . - Standard follow-up : Patients undergo clinical assessment every 3 month year 3 every 6 month year 5 . They assess least yearly thereafter . Patients undergo abdominal ultrasound every 3 month year 3 every 6 month year 5 ; chest x-ray every 6 month year 3 annually year 5 ; colonoscopy 3 year surgery every 3 6 year thereafter . - Reinforced follow-up : Patients undergo clinical assessment every 3 month year 3 every 6 month year 5 . They assess least yearly thereafter . Patients undergo alternate assessment every 3 month comprise thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan abdominal ultrasound year 3 every 6 month year 5 . They also undergo colonoscopy 3 year surgery every 3 6 year thereafter . Patients undergo second randomization 1 2 follow-up arm begin study . - CEA measurement : Patients undergo measurement CEA level every 3 month year 3 , every 6 month year 5 , least yearly thereafter . - No CEA measurement : Patients undergo CEA measurement . Blood tissue block normal tumor tissue collect validation protein serum , genetics , immunologic marker predictive relapse .</detailed_description>
