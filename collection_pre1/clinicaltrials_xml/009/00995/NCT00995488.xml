	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy combination ABI-007 , carboplatin gemcitabine treatment patient advanced bladder cancer . Study participant diagnose advanced bladder cancer . Cisplatin base chemotherapy set activity curative . Furthermore , patient disease comorbidities limit use cisplatin base therapy . Combination paclitaxel , carboplatin gemcitabine active well tolerated patient population . Paclitaxel formulate ethanol Cremophor EL ( polyoxyethylated castor oil ) contribute side effect associate paclitaxel . ABI-007 ( brand name Abraxane™ ) form paclitaxel contain additive may deliver drug tumor cell . ABI-007 approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic ( advanced ) breast cancer base superior anticancer effect , evaluate cancer research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Combination ABI-007 , Carboplatin , Gemcitabine First Line Treatment Advanced Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On basis know single agent activity paclitaxel urothelial cancer , activity combination therapy paclitaxel , carboplatin , gemcitabine advance urothelial cancer couple result study breast cancer demonstrate improve clinical efficacy ABI-007 paclitaxel favorable toxicity profile , propose phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety combination ABI-007 , carboplatin , gemcitabine patient advanced urothelial cancer . Carboplatin gemcitabine dose schedule base previous trial paclitaxel , carboplatin , gemcitabine show acceptable toxicity . Due extent hematologic toxicity expect combination report weekly schedule ABI-007 base combination well experience UMCC protocol 2007.061 originally utilized weekly ABI-007 gemcitabine carboplatin , feel continuous weekly dosing feasible . Therefore trial design ABI-007 D1 schedule every 21 day . The start dose ABI-007 220 mg/m2 , risk significant bone marrow suppression , option dose escalation patient tolerate therapy well first cycle 260 mg/m2 every 21 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient least 18 year age . Histologic cytologic diagnosis urothelial carcinoma ( transitional cell carcinoma either pure mixed histology ) metastatic locally recurrent locally advance eligible high priority trial . must measurable disease . Patients must recover radiation therapy must 25 % bone marrow irradiate . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 ( Appendix 1 . ) Life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate organ marrow function define obtain within 14 day registration : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL platelet &gt; 100,000/µL total bilirubin =1.5 mg/dL creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST ALT &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal Timing guideline prestudy labs measurement : All prestudy lab require determination eligibility complete within 14 day prior registration . Xrays and/or scan assess disease site complete within 1 month prior registration ( next business day fall weekend holiday ) . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Previous systemic chemotherapy current stage disease . Prior treatment ABI007 taxane ( prior treatment taxane neoadjuvant adjuvant set one year prior registration allow ) . Preexisting neuropathy &gt; grade 2 ( i.e . interfere patient function ) . History known spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , evidence symptomatic brain leptomeningeal disease screen CT MRI scan . Known HIV positive patient may participate . This avoid additional complication immune suppression HIV infection may cause due intense nature chemotherapy trial . Concurrent treatment another therapeutic clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial , e.g . QOL , allow . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female subject must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female subject reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum ) prior enrollment . Male subject must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
