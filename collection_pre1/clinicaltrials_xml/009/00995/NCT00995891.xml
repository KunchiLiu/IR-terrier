	<brief_summary>Background : - Laboratory research study require control sample healthy volunteer compare samples patient . These study help researcher well understand refine treatment immune system inflammatory disease . Objective : - To obtain blood , urine , buccal ( mouth ) mucosa , normal tissue bone marrow sample and/or leukopheresis cell healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy individual least 8 year age . Design : - Volunteers recruit Program Healthy Volunteers , Patient Recruitment Public Liaison Office , self-referral clinicaltrials.gov Web site . - Health confirm brief history physical examination blood work . - Volunteers 8 year age old provide blood urine sample use standard procedure . Buccal mucosa sample obtain scrap inside cheek sterile nylon brush . - Bone marrow sample obtain volunteer 18 year age old take two aspirate posterior iliac crest ( area near hip ) . - Normal tissue sample obtain volunteer 18 year age old take superficial skin sample ( punch biopsy ) - Leukopheresis lymphapheresis perform volunteer 18 year age old obtain white blood cell research - Samples assign unique code store longer scientific value volunteer withdraws consent use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Blood , Bone Marrow , Buccal Mucosa Samples From Healthy Volunteers Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) Laboratory Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol collect blood ( age 8 older ) , urine ( age 8 older ) , buccal mucosa sample ( age 8 older ) , normal tissue ( ages18 older ) bone marrow ( age 18 older ) and/or leukapheresis cell ( age 18 older ) healthy volunteer , include pregnant woman ( age 18 older , blood and/or buccal mucosa ) . To enrol study , pregnant woman must carry diagnosis immune-mediated inflammatory disease , sign symptom immune inflammatory disease ; otherwise may eligible participation CHI protocol 10-H-0162 affected adult cohort . Samples use control clinical translational research Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) . These control sample indispensable many laboratory research project , include understand pathophysiology wide variety immune-mediated inflammatory disease . The primary objective provide mechanism collection , track , store , dispense , analyze dispose laboratory research sample healthy volunteer . There primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
