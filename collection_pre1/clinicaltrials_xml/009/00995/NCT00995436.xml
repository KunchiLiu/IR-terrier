	<brief_summary>Research problem : Anchorage reinforcement effective headgear provide patient compliance optimal . Nance palatal arch also show effective . Microscrews despite popularity however scientific evidence support use . Aim : To compare effectiveness 3 method anchorage reinforcement 1 ) headgear 2 ) Nance palatal arch 3 ) orthodontic micro-screws . Hypothesis : There difference amount anchorage loss three method anchorage reinforcement . Design : Randomized clinical trial . Setting : District General Hospital orthodontic department Participants : 78 patient require `` absolute anchorage '' . Interventions : The subject randomize 3 group . In group 1 headgear request 12-14 hour per day . In group 2 nance palatal arch place use intra oral anchorage reinforcement . In group 3 , orthodontic micro-screws use anchorage . Method investigation : The study 78 'absolute anchorage ' patient older 12 year randomly assign one three group anchorage reinforcement Outcome measure : 1 . Anchorage loss measure lateral Cephalometric radiograph 3-D model scanning , record take three point 2 . Patient perception different treatment method , include surgical experience Data analysis : The data analyse intention treat basis . Basic descriptive statistic uni-variate test initially do explore data . Final data analysis involve relevant multi-variate statistical modeling . Dissemination : Conference proceeding , journal paper Cochrane oral health group .</brief_summary>
