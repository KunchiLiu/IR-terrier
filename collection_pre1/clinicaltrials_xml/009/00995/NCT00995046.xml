	<brief_summary>Patients severe haemophilia A lack clot factor FVIII suffer spontaneous traumatic bleeds . In absence treatment , frequent bleeds joint lead severe joint destruction . In 1960s , prophylactic therapy develop involve infusion clot factor regular schedule order keep clotting level sufficiently high prevent spontaneous bleed episode . Prophylaxis start early age age 2 year first joint bleed . The Malm√∂ experience indicate treatment effective administer large dos least 3 time weekly . However , intensive treatment young boy may difficult carry home treatment . Currently , international recommendation prophylactic therapy regimen . Because high cost limited availability factor concentrate , dose important issue prophylaxis therapy . It recently show 24 hour FVIII concentrate administration , patient present similar FVIIII level , thrombin generation capacity may significantly different . In addition , independently FVIII level , correlation find severe clinical bleeding phenotype thrombin generate capacity . The aim present clinical study ass thrombin generation test main surrogate marker evaluate coagulating capacity haemophiliac prophylaxis regimen . Optimizing prophylactic therapy patient 's phenotype loss clinical effectiveness significantly improve patient ' quality life , protect haemophilic child arthropathy possibly limit cost prophylaxis therapy .</brief_summary>
