	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) major worldwide problem.Steroids inhaler establish treatment COPD . Inhaled steroids number bad effect include suppression adrenal gland absorption . A previous study patient COPD . C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) peptide produce liver response inflammation . Elevated circulating level CRP associate heart condition . High level CRP also find patient COPD . In study , steroid inhaler reduce CRP level , inflammatory mediator , patient COPD . It unknown whether reflect reduction lung inflammation effect systemically absorb corticosteroid . It propose investigate link inhale corticosteroid serum CRP , lung inflammation ( measure exhale nitric oxide ) systemic absorption steroid .</brief_summary>
