	<brief_title>Study Assess Airway Inflammation Effects FlutiForm® pMDI Low High Dose Adults With Mild Moderate Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist two 4-week treatment period , precede 14-21 wash-out period . Subjects randomise receive two three study treatment - FlutiForm® pMDI 50/5 µg , FlutiForm® pMDI 250/10 µg , placebo ( dummy inhaler ) . During wash-out period , subject take salbutamol , require , rescue medication . Subjects record daily diary PEFR , study medication use , rescue medication use , asthma symptom score , sleep disturbance due asthma . Assessments perform study clinic visit include inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate ( AMP ) challenge test , induce sputum test , exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) test , spirometry test . Safety assess lab test , vital sign , ECG adverse event .</detailed_description>
