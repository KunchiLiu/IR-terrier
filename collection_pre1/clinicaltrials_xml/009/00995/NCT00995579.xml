	<brief_title>Assessment Energy Expenditure Indirect Calorimetry Daily 10,000 Steps Goal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical inactivity consider major risk factor number adverse health outcome obesity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , all-cause mortality . Certain guideline specifically recommend take 10,000 step per day goal . Some pedometer function energy expenditure estimation addition count step . However , EE derive pedometer indirect estimation calculate metabolic calculation instead direct measurement.The purpose study measure actual energy expenditure ( EE ) use indirect calorimetry 10,000 step goal , compare estimate EE use predictive equation . Twenty healthy college volunteer recruit . First , height weight measure subject . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate ratio weight height meter square . We use BioScan 920 get subject ' body composition data include fat mass fat-free mass . Followed measurement basic characteristic , subject wear pedometer walk 10,000 step treadmill . The walking speed range 3.0 4.0 mile per hour ( mph ) accord different gender . The speed 4.0 mph set male 3.0 mph set female . If subject could'nt follow pre-set speed , he/she could walk self-comfortable speed speed range 3.0 4.0 mph define moderate intensity ACSM 's recommendation . Subjects rest chair back support 3 minute complete 10,000 step goal . After recovery 3 minute , data collection finish . The stop criterion test follow : dizziness , nausea , dyspnea , leg fatigue lead subject unable continue . Expired gas collect use Cosmed K4b2 portable indirect calorimetry system , EE monitor breath-by-breath accord follow formula : EE ( Kcal/min ) = 3.781×VO2＋1.237×VCO2 VO2 represent standardize oxygen consumption per minute , VCO2 carbon dioxide production per minute . Estimated EE calculate predictive equation publish ACSM : VO2 ( ml/kg/min ) = 0.1×S ( m/min ) ＋1.8×S×G ( % ) ＋3.5 S represent walk speed , G walk grade . The total walking duration distance take 10,000 step also record . Pulmonary function test perform day get subject 's functional vital capacity ( FVC ) . We use parameter estimate subject 's predict maximal minute ventilation ( predict max VE ) accord equation provide guideline American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) cardiopulmonary exercise testing : VE ( L/min ) = 26.3×VC－34 VC represent vital capacity . The ratio average VE walk predict maximal VE calculate determine level exercise intensity take 10,000 step .</detailed_description>
