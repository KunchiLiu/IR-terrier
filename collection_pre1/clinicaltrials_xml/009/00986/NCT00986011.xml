	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Overweight obesity associate multiple type disease , include cancer . Living smart growth community may encourage behavior would reduce risk obesity . PURPOSE : This research study look effect smart growth community prevention obesity middle- , moderately low- low-income family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Smart Growth Community 's Effect Prevention Obesity Middle- , Moderately Low- Low-Income Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate effect whole set well individual smart growth principle prevention obesity risk middle , moderately low , low-income family reside smart growth community , Preserve , compare two type control group family reside community may naturally vary exposure principle . - To evaluate longitudinal-mediational relationship increase activity pro-health attitude achieve smart growth community low obesity risk . - To identify trajectory physical activity time evaluate relationship obesity risk , include high-stable , early-onset stable , early-onset short-term , low-stable trajectory . Secondary ( exploratory ) - To evaluate demographic x type community ( smart growth v ) interaction ( major ethnic group represent Hispanic v white ) , gender , parent v child outcome , well obesogenic trajectory . - To evaluate possible `` chaining '' translational effect , i.e. , whether effect live smart growth community generalize change eat behavior part general change health attitude . - To assess whether neighborhood physical activity actually take place ( define 0.5 square-mile area 10-15 walking distance residence , school [ child ] , work equivalent [ index adult ] , leisure ) , contribute significantly physical activity eat behavior beyond effect smart growth community residence . - To determine whether individual smart growth principle may relatively great impact obesity risk others , intervention control community . - To assess whether physical activity trajectory hypothesize identified predictive relationship obesity prevention . OUTLINE : Participants receive accelerometer monitor instruct wear 7 continuous day ( except sleeping , bathing , swim ) right hip attach adjust belt assess physical activity . Participants also undergo anthropometric measure ( height weight ) use calibrate digital scale professional stadiometer . Participants complete survey questionnaires Self-reported Physical Activity , Self-reported Dietary Intake , Social Network Survey . Participants also complete self-reported item assess demographic characteristic , family finance , health status , health history , length current residence , home-relocation pattern , time use transportation pattern , substance use , depression , sleep habit , fast-food consumption , school work address . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 390 family live The Preserve , 195 family choose live The Preserve , 195 control family live surround area accrue study .</detailed_description>
