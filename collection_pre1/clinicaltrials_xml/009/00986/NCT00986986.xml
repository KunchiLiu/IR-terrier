	<brief_summary>This study pilot study examine effect extended-release niacin ( Niaspan ® ) flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery , among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 infect individual low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) . Brachial artery diameter measure high-resolution ultrasound entry week 12 study . The primary comparison change FMD baseline 12 week within two arm . The second specific aim investigate proportion effect extended-release niacin know cardiovascular marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Niacin Endothelial Function HIV-infected Subjects With Low High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) lipid pattern consistent atherogenic dyslipidemia also common human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect population likely due , large part , chronic inflammatory effect HIV infection per se . While highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) resultant reconstitution immune system might expect lead improvement lipid profile , study research well others clearly demonstrate therapy fail fully correct low HDL pattern . This coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk HIV population compound dyslipidemic effect various protease inhibitor antiretroviral medication use treat HIV . Endothelial dysfunction early marker atherosclerosis determine non-invasively utilizing assessment flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery , may analogous blood flow coronary artery . Using novel technology HIV model chronic inflammatory state , propose determine increase HDL subject low HDL LDL elevation may potential beneficial effect . Our overall hypothesis pilot project increase HDL level HIV-infected subject low HDL use extended-release niacin 12 week period lead identifiable improvement endothelial function . Specific Aim 1 . To compare endothelial function , measure flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery , among HIV-1 infected individual low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) treatment extended-release niacin ( Niaspan ® ) - Conduct prospective randomize 12-week clinical trial HIV-1 infected individual low HDL normal low density lipoprotein level plan continue current anti-retroviral regimen - Subjects randomize either treatment control arm - Subjects randomize treatment arm receive extended-release niacin ( Niaspan ® ) start 500 mg per night titrate maximum tolerate dose ( exceed 1500 mg per night ) - Assess change FMD brachial artery use high-resolution ultrasound baseline week 12 ( Total 2 FMD assessment ) - Correlate change HDL change FMD Hypothesis test : Use extended-release niacin improve FMD among HIV-1 infected individual low HDL - Following 12 week therapy , subject treat extended-release niacin show 8 % improvement FMD compare control - There positive correlation change HDL change FMD Specific Aim 2 . To evaluate change lipid parameter , insulin sensitivity cardiovascular risk marker change FMD among treatment control arm - Assess compare change non-HDL lipid lipoprotein parameter change FMD among two arm - Assess compare change insulin sensitivity homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) change FMD among two arm - Assess compare change cardiovascular risk marker adhesion molecule C-reactive protein change FMD among two arm Hypothesis test : There correlation improvement lipid , insulin sensitivity cardiovascular risk marker FMD extend niacin treatment arm SIGNIFICANCE RATIONALE : Low HDL cholesterol level elevate CAD risk independent low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level . In association high triglyceride level small LDL particle size , low HDL part syndrome atherogenic dyslipidemia . This form dyslipidemia characteristic underlie dyslipidemia find HIV-infected subject , likely represent consequence chronic inflammatory change due HIV , contribute substantively CAD risk population even without add risk dyslipidemic antiretroviral medication . Primary CAD preventive modality may warrant patient HIV population well general population manifest type dyslipidemia . Niacin currently best medication available elevate HDL cholesterol level . Thus , use novel technique assess flow-mediated dilatation brachial artery , pilot project propose ass whether use extend release niacin lead short term improvement endothelial function . If successful , study may lay foundation study potential use niacin prevention CAD patient particularly risk CAD due low HDL cholesterol level .</detailed_description>
