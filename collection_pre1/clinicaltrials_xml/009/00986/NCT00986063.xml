	<brief_summary>Genetic test suggest reduce side effect relate Nevirapine ( NVP ) , commonly prescribed component highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) develop country . This clinical trial design determine efficacy cost-effectiveness approach develop country set . NVP-based HAART efavirenz ( EFV ) -based HAART provide Thai national universal health coverage . Information prescribe drug collect , monitor compliance prescribe highly active antiretroviral therapy conduct . Outcome measurement : The primary objective study evaluate reduction incidence NVP associate cutaneous side effect genotype base personalized prescription . The volunteer monitor solicited non-solicited adverse effect 6 month drug administration , first 6 week intensive monitor cutaneous adverse reaction . Laboratory safety profile ( Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , direct bilirubin , total bilirubin , lactate dehydrogenase , alkaline phosphatase ) assess intensive monitoring period ( 6 week ) . Statistical Methods : Descriptive statistic use evaluate conduct study . Analysis variable include overall follow-up rate , drug compliance , event protocol violation . Laboratory safety data present use comparative statistic study group compare within group use standard parametric non-parametric comparison test , i.e. , McNemar 's test pair t-test appropriate . Comparison rate cutaneous adverse reaction , hepatitis severe cutaneous adverse reaction ( SCAR ) make chi-square test . Variable show significant different `` standard care '' control group `` genetic test '' intervention group adjust final analysis Poisson logistic regression . The overall rate adverse event participant monitor whether rate adverse event lower predefined criterion . The extension trial may consider base rate adverse event .</brief_summary>
