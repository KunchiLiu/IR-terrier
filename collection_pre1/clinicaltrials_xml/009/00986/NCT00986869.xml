Complications associated procedure rare study estimate incidence 0.5-4 % ( 3 ) The commonly recognize complication include hypoxia , bleeding , bronchospasm , cardiac dysrhythmias , pneumothorax , vagal reaction ( 4 ) . Several condition increase risk complication include pre-existent hypoxemia , use mechanical ventilation , uremia , profound thrombocytopenia , coagulopathy pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) ( 5 ) . Although previous report suggest transbronchial biopsy increase risk hemorrhage population , data limit survey analysis isolate report . Recently Guzman et al . report retrospective analysis safety FB PH . ( 6 ) They find FB perform safely patient mild moderate PH . However , study small retrospective analysis .

Furthermore , consensus regarding level pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) consider safe invasive diagnostic intervention TBLB transbronchial needle aspiration . Objective To assess safety FB patient PH study occurrence complication associate different diagnostic bronchoscopic procedure . Materials Methods Study Population 100 patient undergo bronchoscopy accord regular indication study period ( 12 month ) eligible study . Criteria exclusion Exclusion criterion age 18 year patient unable obtain informed consent . Patients know severe pulmonary hypertension ( PAP 70 mmHg ) exclude study . Procedural Conduct All procedures perform bronchoscopy suite Pulmonary Department Meir Medical center . Fluoroscopy available procedure . FB perform train pulmonary physician blind echocardiograpgic finding . Oxygen administer patient ensure SpO2 &gt; 90 % prior introduction bronchoscope . Continuous pulse oximetry , electrocardiogram noninvasive blood pressure monitoring obtain throughout procedure . Sedation achieve use midazolam . Topical anesthesia ( ) obtain use 2 % lidocaine . Study Subjects All patient undergo Doppler echocardiogram day bronchoscopy bronchoscopy . The diagnosis PH define ( 1 ) mean PAP ( mPAP ) &gt; 25 mm Hg measure right heart catheterization ( RHC ) , ( 2 ) right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP ) &gt; 40 mm Hg estimate Doppler echocardiography . PAP calculate sum tricuspid regurgitation gradient estimate right atrial pressure , provide increase pulmonic valve flow velocity .Maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity ( take available view ) measure continuous wave Doppler echocardiography evaluate pressure gradient right ventricle right atrium . Right atrial pressure estimate basis inferior vena cava ( IVC ) size inspiratory collapse ( 7,8 ) . Data Collection Data collect patient include baseline characteristic age , sex , medication electrocardiogram . Blood test include blood count , indication bronchoscopy , duration bronchoscopic procedure . All echocardiogram finding collect physician blind bronchoscpoic detail . Outcome Measures The primary outcome incidence complication FB . Complications define hypoxemia ( SpO2 &lt; 90 % need supplemental oxygen within 30 min complete procedure ) , hypotension ( mean arterial pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg 5 min and/or need administration intravenous solution vasopressor ) , cardiac dysrhythmias ( new onset arrhythmia worsen underlying arrhythmia cause hemodynamic instability and/or require urgent intervention ) , bleed , death . The amount bleeding estimate : bleed - minimal bleeding require suctioning ; mild bleed - need continually suction airway ; moderate bleed - need wedge FB segment involve ; severe bleed - need additional intervention transfusion . Statistical Analysis Results express mean Â± SD continuous variable . Qualitative data express percentage patient 95 % confidence interval . Nominal variable compare Pearson 's 2 Fisher 's exact test . Continuous outcome variable compare use Student 's test rank-sum test appropriate . Statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05 . Statistical analysis perform use statistical software package ( SPSS , version 13.0 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Ill. , USA ) .</detailed_description>
