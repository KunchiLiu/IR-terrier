	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving booster vaccination may make strong immune response prevent delay recurrence cancer . PURPOSE : To evaluate efficacy poly-ICLC + MUCI peptide vaccine boost immunologic response MUCI patient triple-negative BC</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine boost systemic immunity MUC1 woman complete therapy AJCC ( American Joint Committee Cancer ) stage I-III 'triple-negative ' [ i.e. , ER ( - ) PR ( - ) HER2/neu ( - ) ] breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity MUC1 peptide poly-ICLC vaccine cohort patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive MUC-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) poly-ICLC vaccine SC week 0 , 2 , 10 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may receive booster vaccine week 52 . Patients follow study-related Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) period 30 day last vaccination . If patient experience SAE participate study , follow resolution SAE .</detailed_description>
