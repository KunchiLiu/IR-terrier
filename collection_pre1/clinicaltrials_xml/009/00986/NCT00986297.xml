	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose specialized radiation therapy treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer poor performance status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specialized Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Poor Performance Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To escalate dose accelerate hypofractionated image-guided conformal radiotherapy potent tumoricidal dose without exceed maximum-tolerated dose patient recurrent stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer poor performance status . Secondary - To evaluate local regional tumor control overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo accelerate hypofractionated image-guided conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 3 week ( 15 fraction ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
