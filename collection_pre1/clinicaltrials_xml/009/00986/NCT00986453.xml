	<brief_title>PEAK PlasmaBlade 4.0 Bilateral Breast Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bilateral breast reduction surgical procedure perform remove excess breast tissue female breast therapeutic cosmetic indication . The purpose breast reduction decrease weight breast restructure breast tissue favorable appearance . Typically , scalpel use skin incision traditional electrosurgical device use cut away excess tissue . The PEAK PlasmaBladeâ„¢ use pulse radiofrequency ( RF ) energy highly-insulated handpiece design enable precision cut coagulation point application . The PlasmaBlade receive FDA clearance use plastic , general , ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) surgery , demonstrate significantly reduce thermal injury profile incise tissue compare traditional electrosurgical device . It hypothesize benefit may improve post-operative outcome patient undergoing bilateral breast reduction . A total forty-five ( 45 ) subject enrol study . Forty-three ( 43 ) underwent bilateral breast reduction , two ( 2 ) subject withdraw prior surgery . Enrollment surgery take place 18 September 2009 12 August 2011 . Potential subject screen inclusion exclusion criterion study protocol require provide informed consent prior enrollment . Following enrollment , subject operative site prospectively randomize SOC PlasmaBlade ( PB PEAK ) study group schedule bilateral breast reduction . Subjects unaware device use breast .
