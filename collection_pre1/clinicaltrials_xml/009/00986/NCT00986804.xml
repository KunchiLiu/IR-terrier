	<criteria>Patient Screening Criteria Enrollment Process This single institution study Washington University School Medicine St. Louis . Study population patient &gt; =18 year age , histologically confirm AML MDS accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria undergo alloHCST . All screening procedure part patient clinical care . Patients , legal authorize representative , provide write informed consent study prior alloHSCT , 100 day follow alloHSCT Patients undergo alloHSCT per institutional guideline . AlloHSCT may perform use related unrelated donor , myeloablative nonmyeloablative preparative regimen , either peripheral blood bone marrow source graft . Patients fulfill Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria period ≥ 50 ≤ 100 day alloHSCT register study receive decitabine maintenance . Bone marrow biopsy perform ≤ 14 day prior start decitabine confirm remission . Any GVHD prophylaxis therapy allow study . Patients fulfill Inclusion Criteria eligible register study consider screening failure . Study include maximum 32 evaluable patient . Inclusion Criteria History AML MDS use WHO classification . &gt; 50 &lt; 100 day follow HLAmatched related unrelated donor alloHSCT . Donors may mismatch single antigen HLAA , B DR locus plus possible single antigen mismatch HLAC accord institution guideline . Twoantigen mismatch single locus allow . Age &gt; =18 year . Bone marrow biopsy confirm complete remission alloHSCT Complete remission : le 5 % blast aspirate bone marrow sample count least 200 nucleated cell , blast Auer rod persistence extramedullary disease PLUS absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/μL , platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL leukemic blast peripheral blood . Platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL without platelet transfusion 7 day ANC ≥ 1,500/µL without colony stimulate factor support . Performance status &lt; ECOG 2 . Acceptable organ function define : creatinine &lt; 1.5 time institutional ULN creatinine clearance ( calculate Cockroft Gault method ) ≥ 30 mL/min bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time institutional ULN AST , ALT alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 time institutional ULN . Each Patient legal authorize representative must sign institutional review board/ethics committeeapproved informed consent indicate awareness investigational nature study . Female Subjects : Female childbearing potential ( FCBP* ) must agree use reliable form contraception practice complete abstinence heterosexual intercourse least 28 day start study drug , participate study , least 28 day discontinuation study . The method reliable contraception include intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) , tubal ligation , partner 's vasectomy , latex condom , diaphragm cervical cap . FCBP must agree pregnancy test . FCBP must negative pregnancy test prior start study drug . FCBP must agree abstain donate blood and/or egg study participation least 28 day discontinuation study * A female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Male Subjects : Must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP participate study least 28 day follow discontinuation study even undergone successful vasectomy Must agree abstain donate blood , semen , sperm study participation least 28 day discontinuation study . Must agree pregnancy positive pregnancy test occur female partner male study subject study participation , study drug must immediately discontinue must immediately notify principal investigator . Exclusion Criteria History previous alloHSCT prior current alloHSCT . Persistent AML MDS alloHSCT . Grade 3 4 acute GVHD , See Appendix A . Positive serology HIV . Pregnancy nursing . Other cancer less equal 2 year prior study entry except : basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , carcinoma situ breast , prostate cancer stage T1a T1b . Uncontrolled active infection require intravenous antibiotic . Clinically significant systemic illness ( e.g . serious active infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) , , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate protocol therapy . Known suspected hypersensitivity decitabine . Patients may receive investigational agent . General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator .</criteria>
