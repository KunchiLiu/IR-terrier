	<brief_title>Individual Environmental Risk Factors Unplanned Admissions Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic disease fail concerned people , notably elderly accumulate . Failure fail organ old old citizen ( 80 ) often lead unplanned hospitalization may dreadful consequence , worsen condition even death . Few study seek identify individual environmental risk factor unplanned hospitalization elderly citizen . The development nation-wide share medical record would allow build alert system factor model . Objective : The aim multicenter study investigate risk factor unplanned hospitalization , include individual environmental factor , notably air pollution . Classifying risk patient might help prevent unplanned hospitalization old old . Correlations medical data atmospheric pollution model allow u enhance forecast system dose-effect function . Validation multi dimensional standardised instrument ( InterRAI-MDS ) help development share medical record . Methods : Patient age 80 present emergency department ( ED ) medical concern eventually associate social concern admit medical surgical ward . Three hospital , two locate Paris area one Champagne , offer emergency care provide geriatric service involve study . 1,200 patient prospectively include study one-year period . 1 . Individual study Data collection involve three step ( , health event ) hospital admission ( i.e . study inclusion ) rely multi dimensional standardize geriatric assessment use well establish scale : Retrospective data collection include medical history , health care utilization , SOCIO-economic status functional status day hospital admission ; Data collection hospital admission include functional , mental , nutritional depression status assess geriatric physician nurse ( standardized geriatric assessment ) ; social support care plan record discharge ; SOCIO-economic condition also record Data collection follow-up include health functional status assess three , six , nine month one year first emergency visit , help family family physician . Hospitalizations death record . 2 . Environmental contextual data Meteorological data well data pollution , epidemic , strike health care system public transportation public holiday gather study period . The use atmospheric transport chemistry model CHIMERE give great spatial ( 2 3 km ) temporal ( hour ) resolution airborne measurement pollutant . 3 . Analysis A bidirectional case-crossover design use . Cases serve control use information study subject event ( hospitalization ) . Conditional logistic regression use investigate short-term health effect air pollution take account individual characteristic . Survival analysis time dependant covariates ( environmental factor ) give strengthen result . A multi dimensional analysis perform determine cluster patient pattern environmental parameter . Validation RAI-MDS instrument rely internal coherency , structural validity external validity face usual geriatric scale ( ADL , IADL , MMSE , MNA , GDS ) . Perspectives Identification individual risk factor well evaluation environmental threat old people , potentialized set medical share across caregiver could allow develop individualized alarm prevention system .</detailed_description>
