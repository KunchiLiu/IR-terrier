	<brief_summary>Rosuvastatin belong class medication commonly call `` statin '' medication give high low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) 'bad ' cholesterol prevent atherosclerosis ( harden blood vessel ) low risk heart attack circulation problem . Recent study general non-HIV infect population show beneficial effect statins prevent circulation problem large would expect lower LDL-cholesterol alone . It suggest additional beneficial effect statin may due anti-inflammatory effect statin . The risk heart attack circulation problem may high HIV infected individual . This may due inflammatory stress effect HIV . The main purpose study see rosuvastatin beneficial effect circulatory system HIV infect individual even high LDL cholesterol level . Therefore , HIV-infected individual normal low LDL cholesterol level evidence low HDL cholesterol level may sign low grade inflammation , study look whether 3 month rosuvastatin lead improvement brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) , marker early atherosclerosis ( harden blood vessel ) .</brief_summary>
