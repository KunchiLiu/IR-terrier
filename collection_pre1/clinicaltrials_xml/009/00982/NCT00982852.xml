	<detailed_description>Patients severe blockage one arteries provide blood flow heart enrol research study . Most procedure study standard care use cardiologist treat blocked artery . Patients enrol need treat IVUS- VH ( intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology ) arterial stent procedure , involve thread tiny wire artery , follow balloon , stent , device treat block artery , often ( though always ) , special ultrasound catheter take picture inside artery . We collect data state standard medical care procedure . Participants study , additional procedure perform : tiny tube advance heart artery collect blood sample research purpose , blood sample collect femoral ( thigh ) artery tube place standard part procedure . The blood collect analyzed marker inflammation irritation blood ( c-reactive protein , myeloperoxidase , Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ) , well gene call Matrix Metallopeptidase 3 , believe influence progression plaque wall arteries progression coronary artery disease . . Finally , discharge hospital , research nurse call home ask question approximately 5-10 minute . Telephone follow-up occur one month , six month , 12 month , 18 month , 24 month , 36 month .</detailed_description>
