	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study combination chemotherapy give together vismodegib see well work compare combination chemotherapy without vismodegib treat patient advanced stomach cancer gastroesophageal junction cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Vismodegib may stop growth stomach gastroesophageal junction cancer block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give without vismodegib treat stomach cancer gastroesophageal junction cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Vismodegib Treating Patients With Advanced Stomach Cancer Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) FOLFOX ( fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ) chemotherapy improve median progression free survival ( PFS ) first line treatment patient advance gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition GDC-0449 FOLFOX chemotherapy affect overall survival . II . To determine addition GDC-0449 FOLFOX chemotherapy affect response rate . III . To determine addition GDC-0449 FOLFOX chemotherapy affect toxicity rate first line treatment patient advance gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine level baseline hedgehog pathway activation correlate clinical outcome response treatment GDC-0449 . II . In patient consent repeat biopsy week 4-5 , hedgehog pathway expression assess ( every attempt make obtain repeat biopsy site initial biopsy ) compare baseline value clinical outcome . III . To determine primary gastric cancer gene expression profile may predict response GDC-0449 . IV . To determine serum shed collagen epitope correlate clinical outcome may use assess efficacy GDC-0449 treatment . V. To determine circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) 's correlate treatment response may use assess efficacy GDC-0449 treatment . VI . To determine hedgehog pathway expression downregulated EPC 's follow treatment GDC-0449 . VII . To determine serum expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , insulin-like growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) 3 correlate clinical outcome may use assess efficacy GDC-0449 treatment . VIII . To determine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) expression predictive assess efficacy GDC-0449 treatment . Of note , Her2 status collect retrospectively patient test part standard care establish October 2010 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive FOLFOX chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 . Patients also receive placebo orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 . ARM II : Patients receive FOLFOX chemotherapy Arm I . Patients also receive vismodegib PO day 1-14 . In arm , treatment repeat every 2 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
