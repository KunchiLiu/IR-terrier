	<brief_title>First-line Treatment Patients With Stage IV Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Necitumumab ( IMC-11F8 ) Pemetrexed-Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multinational , randomize , multicenter , open-label Phase 3 study 633 participant advance , nonsquamous ( Stage IV ) NSCLC . Participants randomize 1:1 basis receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consist pemetrexed cisplatin study Arm A , first-line pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy alone Arm B. Baseline radiographic assessment disease perform within 21 day prior randomization ( first treatment administer within 7 day follow randomization ) . Participants undergo radiographic assessment ( compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) disease status every 6 week ( ± 3 day ) , radiographic documentation progressive disease ( PD ) . Chemotherapy continue maximum six cycle arm ( Or radiographic documentation PD , toxicity require cessation , protocol noncompliance withdrawal consent ) ; participant Arm A continue receive necitumumab radiographic documentation PD , toxicity require cessation , protocol noncompliance , withdrawal consent . After end-of-study-visit ( follow PD ) , follow-up information regard anticancer treatment survival collect every 2 month ( ± 7 day ) . For participant discontinue study reason PD ( eg , symptomatic deterioration ) , information disease progression also collect PD document . Follow-up continue long participant alive , end trial .</detailed_description>
