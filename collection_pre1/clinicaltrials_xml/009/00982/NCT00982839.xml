	<brief_summary>At least 60 % patient constipation dyssynergic defecation ( anismus ) 30-50 % patient fecal incontinence exhibit impaired rectal sensation . The problem may improve biofeedback therapy . Traditionally , biofeedback therapy perform use syringe-assisted technique . Although respond method , many , particularly severe rectal hyposensitivity prove refractory . Also , repeat inflation deflation large volume air , use hand-held syringe cumbersome time consume . Recently , pilot observation , investigator see barostat-assisted technique biofeedback therapy simpler easy perform could possibly effective . The investigator ' aim : 1 . To perform randomize control study compare syringe-assisted sensory conditioning ( biofeedback therapy ) technique barostat assist sensory conditioning improve rectal sensation patient rectal hyposensitivity bowel dysfunction . 2 . To investigate impact sensory condition psychosocial issue quality life . 3 . To compare cost-effectiveness therapeutic modality The specific hypothesis test ; When compare receive syringe-assisted training , patient receive barostat training demonstrate : 1 . Lower sensory threshold rectal perception ( first sensation , desire defecate urgency ) 2 . Greater satisfaction bowel function ( VAS Score ) , stool frequency , consistency &amp; straining . 3 . Better learn ability great ease administer training .</brief_summary>
