	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) affect least 750,000 Canadians currently 4th lead cause death Canada . Almost everyone COPD suffers shortness breath ( dyspnea ) worsen time despite standard treatment ( inhaler , exercise program oxygen ) . Patients family identify relief dyspnea top priority improve care . New approach need treat advanced COPD lessen burden place live patient family alike . Opioid drug , morphine , help COPD many way , include reduce dyspnea , fear anxiety . Opioids use widely cancer similar symptom . However , historical bias use advanced COPD ( mostly due fear side effect much high dose investigator intend use past ) . No study assess value patient use low dose opioids advance COPD addition conventional treatment . The investigator plan study involve record interview 30 patient partner key family member start treatment low dose morphine , understand experience use morphine . The investigator also ask complete questionnaire quality life , dyspnea , anxiety , depression fear . Descriptions experience use morphine potential inform patient , family , clinician professional society benefit harm opioid use dyspnea advance stage common serious lung disease traditional treatment often fail . The investigator conduct study urban ( Halifax Saskatoon ) rural setting ( New Brunswick ) . The investigator ' study inexpensive widely available treatment potential improve care outcomes advanced COPD many Canadians live die serious lung disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>We define advanced COPD include severe COPD CTS criterion ( i.e. , severe shortness breath result patient breathless leave house , breathlessness dressing/undressing ( i.e. , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) score 5 ) , presence chronic respiratory failure ( PaCO2 &gt; 45 ) clinical sign right heart failure ) . We also include patient short breath stop walk 100 meter minute level ( MRC score 4 ) least one following : BMI &lt; 21 ; postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict ; one hospital admission acute exacerbation COPD previous year . MRC 4 patient recruited baseline Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnea domain ( CRQD ) score &lt; 5 , entry criterion use Canadian RCT involve patient advanced lung disease . Patients and/or caregiver cognitive difficulty would preclude questionnaire completion . Inability speak understand English . Patients consider die expect survival le 2 month .</criteria>
