	<brief_title>Validation Index Neutropenia ( D-index ) Febrile Neutropenic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neutropenia major risk factor invasive fungal infection , particularly cause mould , Aspergillus spp. , Fusarium spp . Zygomycetes . Among neutropenic patient , invasive mould infection ( IMI ) occur almost exclusively patient profound neutropenia ( &lt; 100 neutrophils/mm3 ) last 10-15 day [ 1-3 ] . Empiric antifungal therapy consider standard care patient persistent recurrent fever neutropenia . However use fever sole criterion start empiric therapy , significant number patient receive antifungal therapy unnecessarily , particularly among recipient fluconazole prophylaxis , persistent fever patient commonly due various factor , uncontrolled occult bacterial infection , viral infection , drug fever others [ 4 ] . An alternative empiric antifungal therapy preemptive treatment . In strategy , marker ( serology , radiology clinical data ) add persistent fever [ 5,6 ] . One problem strategy biomarkers currently use ( galactomannan [ GM ] , 1,3-beta-D-glucan PCR ) high sensitivity . If one marker use trigger start antifungal therapy , still considerable number patient use antifungal agent unnecessarily . However , positive biomarker early course neutropenia likely represent false-positive result . By contrast , positive biomarker test late course neutropenia likely true positive . A problem cutoff value duration neutropenia validate help clinician identify 2 possibility . A clinical parameter evaluate dynamic neutropenia , combine intensity duration , could good tool identify patient high risk IMI . This tool could use stratify patient , help clinician select appropriate candidate early antifungal therapy ( empiric preemptive ) persistently febrile neutropenic patient . We develop index ( call D-index ) use data white blood cell count ( WBC ) , combine intensity duration neutropenia . This index test patient acute myeloid leukemia , show good discriminatory performance identify patient IMI without IMI . A cutoff derived , show good sensitivity , specificity high negative predictive value ( 97 99 % ) [ 7 ] . The high negative predictive value index similar obtain GM 1,3-beta-D-glucan febrile neutropenic patient [ 8,9 ] . With regard , D-index could help assess pre-test probability IMI help interpret result positive serum GM / 1,3-beta-D-glucan : patient low value D-index would best interpreted false-positive result test . Similarly , positive biomarkers presence high D-index would likely true positive , since combination different test may increase positive predictive value . This prospective cohort study . The study submit IRB write informed consent obtain participant . Patients age ≥ 18 year eligible acute leukemia , myelodysplasia underlie hematologic malignancy receive chemotherapy expect duration neutropenia ( &lt; 500/mm3 ) &gt; 10 day . This include allogeneic ( autologous ) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Patients past history IMI exclude , since patient secondary prophylaxis advise . Patients enrol initiation chemotherapy later 48h first day neutropenia . The patient able enrol , develop IMI , longer eligible subsequent inclusion . All patient receive antimicrobial prophylaxis fluconazole ( 400mg daily ) . Chest imaging ( X-ray CT scan ) perform enrollment . During period neutropenia induce chemotherapy/ condition regimen , patient survey development fever D-index calculate day day . At time febrile neutropenia , least 2 blood culture collect . Other microbiologic exam obtain clinically indicate . The patient receive broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic ( cefepime ) . Vancomycin add patient clinically suspicion catheter-related infection blood culture yield Gram-positive bacteria yet identify . Serum obtain 3 time week Aspergillus GM assay ( Platelia Aspergillus ; Bio-Rad ) Aspergillus sp . PCR ( in-house real time qualitative quantitative PCR ) . A positive GM define index ≥ 0.5 . In case persistent fever new fever , blood culture collect CT scan chest sinus perform . Results GM check patient stratified accord D-index high , moderate low risk IMI . Based analysis , antifungal therapy ( caspofungin 70 mg day 1 50 mg/d thereafter ) start . In high risk patient ( D index ≥ 5,800 ) , trigger anti mold treatment presence image CT scan positive GM . In moderate risk ( D-index 3,000 5,800 ) , trigger presence persistence positive GM consecutive test . In stratum , chest CT scan define indicative antifungal initiation presence one following : nodule &gt; 1 cm , without halo sign , wedge-shaped image , cavitation . For low-risk patient ( D-index &lt; 3,000 ) , antifungal treatment start persistence positive GM result consecutive test . In situation antifungal treatment start , reassessment parameter make least twice week evaluation D-index biomarkers , week CT scan . In patient lung infiltrates , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) take , provide patient hypoxemic severely thrombocytopenic refractory platelet transfusion . In presence finding sinuses CT scan suggestive sinusitis , nasal endoscopy perform . BAL sinus aspiration sample process direct examination , culture , GM Aspergillus PCR . Other diagnostic procedure perform clinically indicate . Autopsy perform fatal case family authorization . Invasive fungal infection classify accord Revised Definitions European Organization Research Treatment Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group ( EORTC/MSG ) Consensus Group [ 10 ] . To assess performance risk stratification base D-index , overall use antifungal treatment ( al well stratified D-index ) record , report descriptive statistic . The outcome risk stratus ( low , moderate high ) compare regarding : incidence suspect documented mold infection , use anti mold therapy , duration hospitalization death rate . In addition , proportion patient receive early antifungal treatment compare empiric antifungal use historical matched-control cohort . Patients 2 cohort compare use propensity score procedure . Propensity score analysis attempt identify patient similar except treatment . The analysis perform follow : first , probability patient database receive empiric antifungal therapy estimate use multivariate logistic regression model incorporate baseline characteristic , underlie disease co-morbidities . Next , match 2 cohort patient near propensity score ( score generate multivariate equation ) [ 10 ] . Based database ~2,000 episode febrile neutropenia , 36 % patient persistent fever day 4 7 antibiotic would receive empiric antifungal therapy . A total 105 patient would need demonstrate 50 % reduction antifungal use compare cohort match control historical cohort ( alpha = 5 % , beta = 20 % ) .</detailed_description>
