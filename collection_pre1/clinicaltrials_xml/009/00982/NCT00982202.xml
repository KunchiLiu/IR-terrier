	<detailed_description>Inflammatory process important progressive loss memory think skill Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Laboratory study show drug bind protein know `` Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) '' act reduce inflammatory response brain cell know microglia expose amyloid peptide , major part AD pathology . Therefore , drug activate PPARgamma great potential reduce progression AD . Pioglitazone ( PGZ ) activate PPARgamma show favorable clinical experience safety profile patient diabetes . This pilot study determine safety tolerability PGZ patient AD . Another goal study assess clinical measure cognition , daily function , behavior might respond PGZ treatment .</detailed_description>
