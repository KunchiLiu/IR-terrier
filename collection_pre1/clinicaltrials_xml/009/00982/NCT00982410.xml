A set secondary analysis examine group CBT compare educational supportive condition associate great reduction illicit substance use follow-up time period whether during-treatment reduction pain mediate effect treatment assignment later substance use . Finally , series secondary analysis explore whether hypothesize mechanism action CBT intervention mediate effect intervention pain intensity pain tolerance . Methods : The propose study randomize control trial group-based CBT compare educational supportive condition patient currently receive drug alcohol treatment . At least 128 Veterans alcohol drug abuse dependence least moderate pain currently treat Ann Arbor VA Substance Use Disorder treatment clinic assess baseline randomly assign one two condition . These patient re-assessed 3-months ( i.e . immediately post treatment ) , 6-months 12-months . The primary outcome pain intensity , pain-related disability pain tolerance . Mixed model regression analysis use primary analysis estimate between-group difference change individual slope time . Finally , series secondary analysis explore ( ) whether intervention influence post-treatment substance use , ( b ) change pain treatment mediates effect intervention subsequent substance use ( c ) whether hypothesize mechanism action CBT intervention mediate effect intervention pain intensity pain tolerance .</detailed_description>
