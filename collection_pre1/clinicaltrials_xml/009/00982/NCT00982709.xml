	<brief_summary>Aim : To determine Responsiveness iMOBILITY response intensive physical therapy exercise program . ( Is sensitive change ? ) Although exercise think effective intervention balance gait PD ( compare dopaminergic medication DBS surgery ) , best exercise program mobility PD unknown . The iMOBILITY use quantify balance gait performance two PT-supervised , intensive , exercise program , expect improve balance gait . The first program publish Treadmill train program second investigator new Agility training program sensorimotor progression , target specific impairment underlie abnormality balance gait PD ( develop Kinetics Foundation ) . This pilot clinical trial randomize 40 PD subject two exercise program OHSU preparation large clinical trial determine effective exercise mobility disability PD . The effect exercise compare treatment 5-week delay prior start exercise . This trial also determine relative responsiveness ( compare traditional clinical scale ) iMOBILITY test hypothesis intensive exercise improve mobility PD . We use exist instrument ( Berg Balance Scale , BEST dynamic balance , UPDRS , PDQ-39 , 5 time sit-to-stand time Functional Performance Battery ) show difference exercise group . Superior responsiveness iMOBILITY system determine large difference exercise intervention iMOBILITY system traditional clinical measure mobility PD .</brief_summary>
