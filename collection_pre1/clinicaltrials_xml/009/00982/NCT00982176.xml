	<brief_title>Determinants Cognitive Impairment After Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment observe 30 % patient 3 6 month acute coronary syndrome . Executive function mainly impair . Cognition tend progressively deteriorate follow year , therefore increase risk vascular dementia . Increased age low educational level main risk factor whereas risk modify strategy use obtain coronary revascularization . Brain imaging study demonstrate vascular leukoencephalopathy 50 % patient previous history ischaemic heart disease . However link brain anatomo-functional change occurrence cognitive dysfunction remain largely unknown . 50 patient include study . Cognition evaluate use standard neuropsychological assessment ( investigate executive function , memory , attention , language visuo-constructive ability ) 7 day experience sample method evaluate cognition daily life . Brain anatomo-functional study include brain MRI two Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT perform respectively without intravenous injection acetazolamide order measure cerebral blood-flow cerebrovascular reserve capacity . Prospective exploratory study perform cohort patient admitted evaluation cardio-vascular risk factor 4 ±1 month acute coronary syndrome . Patients include 4 ± 1 month first episode acute coronary syndrome . A standard neuropsychological assessment perform neuropsychologist inclusion 6 month later . The daily life experience study perform period 7 consecutive day follow inclusion . Questions ask patient 5 time day pocket computer ( Palm ) . MRI perform 3 Tesla research MRI . Two Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT study perform , first one inclusion second one 2 day less 15 day first . The second SPECT study perform intravenous injection acetazolamide . Relationship cognitive impairment brain anatomo-functional abnormality investigate use linear regression model .</detailed_description>
