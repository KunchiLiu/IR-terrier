	<detailed_description>Heart Failure Normal Ejection Fraction ( HFNEF ) common form heart failure , particularly old person . However , optimal therapy disorder define . The primary chronic symptom HFNEF exercise intolerance , manifest shortness breath fatigue exercise . This major determinant quality life , measure objectively reproducibly modifiable .</detailed_description>
