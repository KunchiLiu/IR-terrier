	<brief_title>Tacrolimus Versus Prednisolone Treatment Minimal Change Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimal change disease common cause nephrotic syndrome adult . Standard treatment high dose steroid often effective control nephrotic syndrome high morbidity due side effect steroid . There also high relapse rate , therefore many patient require long term steroid therapy control disease significant morbidity mortality . Some patient also become steroid resistant . There study show effectiveness alkylating agent cyclophosphamide use drug limited toxicity , include increase rate infection , cancer infertility . Tacrolimus ( prograf ) T-cell specific calcineurin inhibitor share similar immunosuppressive action cyclosporine A.In glomerular disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis membranous glomerulonephritis , prograf show effective treatment proteinuria . This may due immunomodulatory effect underlie disease , may also direct effect tacrolimus ( prograf ) podocyte , stabilise actin cytoskeleton therefore decrease protein leak.Therefore tacrolimus ( prograf ) likely effective reduce proteinuria minimal change disease.It also show good side effect profile use allow avoidance steroid transplantation.This study aim prospectively study tacrolimus ( prograf ) effective treatment minimal change disease compare standard therapy steroid , whether advantage term side effect profile prevention relapse .</detailed_description>
