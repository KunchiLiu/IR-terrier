	<brief_title>Bone Loss After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity increase problem within United States . Fifteen million people United States consider morbidly obese , body mass index ( BMI ) great 40 kg/m2 . A wealth literature show laparoscopic Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery effective procedure reduce excess body weight . But paucity research examine effect laparoscopic Roux-en Y surgery skeleton . Bone remodel complex process involve bone resorption formation-a process dependent upon local systemic influence . Obesity one influence poorly understood . Obesity associate reduce risk osteoporosis . Obesity may protective due increase weight bearing , increase production estrogen adipose tissue , increase bone formation due high level insulin . It known weight loss healthy individual associate bone loss . Several small study report bone loss patient undergoing vertical band gastroplasty jejunoileal bypass weight loss surgery . Other report metabolic disease disarrangement follow weight loss surgery decrease serum calcium , decrease serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D , hyperparathyroidism . In bariatric literature , weight loss associate increase risk bone mineral loss fracture . Osteoporosis describe patient lose weight jejunoileal bypass surgery . Premenopausal woman appear spared bone mineral loss , thus indicate protective effect premenopausal state . Bone mineral loss see premenopausal woman men weight loss surgery . Roux-en Y gastric bypass show effective weight loss adjustable silicone gastric band . It also link increased loss bone mineral density . Another study find increase bone turnover well decrease total bone mass trochanteric bone density laparoscopic Roux-en Y gastric bypass patient . Previous research institution show statistically significant increase prevalence hyperparathyroidism post-gastric bypass patient . However , previous research examine impact hormonal change impart upon bone density . We find statistically significant incidence vitamin D deficiency patient follow surgery . We intend expand upon research well others explore association development hyperparathyroidism , bone metabolic derangement , weight loss , bone density .</detailed_description>
