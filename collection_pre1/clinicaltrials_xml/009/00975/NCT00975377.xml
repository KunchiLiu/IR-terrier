	<brief_summary>The objective study determine whether hair clip non-inferior hair removal prevent superficial , deep , organ space surgical site infection ( SSI ) patient undergo various general surgical procedure , evaluate surgery assessor blind treatment allocation . Additional goal include evaluate wound complication arise patient hair clip patient hair remove determine impact clip versus hair removal SSI versus SSI length hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Public health organization , third party payer , consumer watchdog group , health care quality organization , patient increasingly scrutinize patient safety hospital . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) rate one key quality measure hospital evaluate . Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) guideline provide specific recommendation , weight evidence , prevent SSI . These include follow category 1A recommendation ( Strongly recommend implementation support well-designed experimental , clinical , epidemiological study ) . - Do remove hair preoperatively unless hair around incision site interfere operation - If hair remove , remove immediately operation , preferably electric clipper . However , recent systematic review randomize clinical trial conclude difference SSI among patient hair remove prior surgery . Furthermore , trial involve hair removal largely underpowered marginal quality . If hair go remove , previous study show hair removal clipper depilatory cream result few SSI shave razor . However , need trial compare SSI rate without hair removal stress recent systematic review . No prospective , randomized clinical trial evaluate hair removal vs. hair removal clipping , two hair remove modality prefer CDC SSI prevention guideline , ever report . This study aim ass whether hair removal via clip non-inferior hair removal cohort patient undergo general surgical procedure community hospital . A non-inferiority study design use base upon follow rationale . CDC guideline recommend remove hair preoperatively unless hair interfere operation . However , publish evidence clip hair result SSI hair removal . Clipping hair often preferred surgical perspective . This may historical practice pattern , personal comfort level , either real perceive interference unremoved hair perform operation . Therefore , assess whether clip non-inferior hair removal provide helpful information regard appropriateness current CDC recommendation remove hair preoperatively unless hair interfere operation . Patients assess enrollment decision make elective ( non-emergent ) operative intervention . Patients undergo institution 's current preoperative procedural standard care . Patients specifically instruct shave prior procedure . The day procedure patient undergo institution 's standard preoperative skin preparation , currently include povidone base skin antiseptic . Preoperative antibiotic administer accord institutional standard care particular operation . Randomization assign day surgery preoperative area . Patients randomize 1:1 either undergo clip hair removal . Enrolled patient undergo type hair removal appropriate study arm . Clipping patient undergo hair removal day surgery member preoperative nursing staff , immediately prior schedule operation . Any patient undergoes unanticipated hair removal , ( either additional hair removal patient clip hair removal patient clip ) note protocol deviation event record . Patients undergo surgical procedure accord standard surgical care . Patients schedule follow-up wound assessment train study nurse . This assessment take place independent assessor blind ( best able give study intervention ) study group patient . Additionally , patient see wound problem surgeon , primary physician , physician attempt evaluated one trained nurse visit well . If patient keep follow-up appointment , call ask standardized set question relate wound . Finally , event patient see wound problem facility , department ( i.e . urgent care , emergency room , etc ) , encourage make follow-up appointment within day reassess , time study nurse ass status well . The patient ' electronic medical record update reflect study involvement , alert provider contact study coordinator wound related question see another department .</detailed_description>
