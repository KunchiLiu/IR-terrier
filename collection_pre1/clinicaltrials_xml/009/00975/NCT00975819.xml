	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Sirolimus Complicated Vascular Anomalies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients vascular anomaly ( VA ) spectrum disease broadly classify vascular tumor malformation . Complicated vascular anomaly cause disfigurement , chronic pain , organ dysfunction significant morbidity mortality . Despite severity potential complication , lack uniform guideline treatment response treatment child young adult disease . There pre-clinical clinical data support essential regulatory function PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway vascular growth organization , suggest therapeutic target patient complicate vascular anomaly . The overall goal trial objectively determine effectiveness safety mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin* treatment child young adult diagnose complicated vascular anomaly . We propose Phase 2 trial diagnostic , therapeutic response criterion experimentally determine study use framework future Phase 3 clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion strictly limit child young adult vascular anomaly complication require systemic therapy control . Diagnosis : All patient must one follow vascular anomaly determine clinical , radiographic histologic criterion ( possible ) : Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas without KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Tufted Angioma KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Tufted Angioma without KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Capillary LymphaticoVenous Malformation ( CLVM ) Venous Lymphatic Malformation ( VLM ) Microcystic Lymphatic Malformation ( MLM ) Multifocal Lymphangiomatosis Thrombocytopenia ( MLT ) /Cutaneovisceral Angiomatosis Thrombocytopenia ( CAT ) Capillary Lymphatic Arterial Venous Malformations ( CLAVM ) PTEN Overgrowth syndrome vascular anomaly Lymphangiectasia Syndromes If archive tissue available , histological diagnosis confirm pathology lab enrol site . Complications : Patients must vascular anomaly potential cause significant morbidity . In addition diagnosis , one follow criterion need meet : Coagulopathy Chronic pain Recurrent cellulitis ( &gt; 3 episodes/year ) Ulceration Visceral and/or bone involvement Cardiac dysfunction Age : Patients must 0 31 year age time study entry . Enrollment include patient gender ethnic group . Organ function requirement : Adequate liver function define : Total bilirubin ( sum conjugate unconjugated ) ≤1.5 x ULN age , SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 5 x ULN age , Serum albumin &gt; = 2 g/dL . Fasting LDL cholesterol : Fasting LDL cholesterol &lt; 160 mg/dL Patients take cholesterol lower agent must single medication stable dose least 4 week Adequate Bone Marrow Function define : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1000/microL Hemoglobin &gt; = 8.0 gm/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) Platelet count &gt; = 50,000/microL ( transfusion independent define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day period prior enrollment ) Note : There NO platelet requirement patient KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Adequate Renal Function Defined : • A serum creatinine base age follow : ≤ 5 year age maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 0.8 6 &lt; age ≤ 10 year age maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.0 11 &lt; age ≤ 15 year age maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.2 &gt; 15 year age maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.5 AND cystatin C equal less upper limit normal patient . If cystatin C initially meet criterion , may repeat sensitive screen nuclear GFR must ≥ 70 ml/min . • Urine protein creatinine ratio ( UPC ) &lt; 0.3 g/l Performance Status : Karnofsky &gt; = 50 ( &gt; 10 year age ) Lansky &gt; = 50 patient &lt; = 10 year age Prior therapy requirement : 1 . Patients undergone surgical resection interventional radiology procedure disease control eligible meet inclusion criterion surgery/procedure 2 . Surgery : At least 2 week since undergo major surgery 3 . Steroids : Patients endocrine deficiency allow receive physiologic stress dose steroid necessary . Other patient , vascular tumor patient , need wean dose steroid ( steroid use define intravenous oral steroid require one day ) . 4 . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within 4 week entry onto study . 5 . Hematopoietic GFs : At least 7 day since completion therapy GF support platelet , red white cell number function . 6 . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 14 day since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know AEs occur beyond 14 day administration , period must extend beyond time AEs know occur . These patient must discuss Study Chair casebycase basis . 7 . Patients diagnose Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas Tufted Angiomas require washout period prior enrollment , require discontinue use prohibit concomitant medication upon enrollment study follow guideline protocol . 8 . Investigational Drugs : Patients must receive nonFDA approve drug within 4 week . 9 . XRT : &gt; = 6 month involve field radiation vascular tumor . 10 . CYP3A4 inhibitor : Patients may currently receive strong inhibitor CYP3A4 , may receive medication within 1 week entry . ( See Appendix II ) . These include : Macrolide Antibiotics : clarithromycin , telithromycin , erythromycin , troleandomycin . Gastrointestinal prokinetic agent : cisapride , metoclopramide . Antifungals : itraconazole , ketoconazole , fluconazole ( dose &gt; 200 mg/day ) , voriconazole , clotrimazole Calcium channel blocker : verapamil , diltiazem , nicardipine Other drug : rifampin , bromocriptine , cimetidine ( Tagamet® ) , danazol , cyclosporine oral solution , lansoprazole ( Prevacid® ) . Grapefruit juice . 11 . CYP3A4 inducer : Patients must also avoid strong inducer CYP3A4 , may receive medication within 1 week entry . These include : Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin Antibiotics : rifabutin , rifapentine . Herbal preparation : St. John 's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum , hypericine ) . 12 .

These medication include : Carbamazepine ( Tegretol® ) Felbamate ( Felbtol® ) Phenobarbitol Phenytoin ( Dilantinl® ) Primidone ( Mysoline® ) Oxcarbazepine ( Trileptal® ) Dental brace prosthesis interfere radiologic analysis vascular anomaly . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , severe infection , severe malnutrition , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent . Patients endocrine deficiency allow receive physiologic stress dose steroid necessary . Patients diagnosis vascular tumor ( KHE , TA ) wean dose steroid . Patients require medication inhibit/induce CYP3A4 enzyme activity control concurrent medical condition . Known history HIV seropositivity know immunodeficiency . Testing required unless condition suspect . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption sirolimus ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . A gastric tube nasogastric tube allow . Women pregnant breast feeding . Males female reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method period receive study drug 3 month thereafter . Abstinence acceptable method birth control . Women childbearing potential give pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration sirolimus must negative urine serum pregnancy test . Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol , opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study . Patients currently uncontrolled infection , define receive intravenous antibiotic .</criteria>
