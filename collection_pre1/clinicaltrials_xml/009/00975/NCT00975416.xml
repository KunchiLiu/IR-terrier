	<detailed_description>Objective The therapeutic alliance ( TA ) , work relationship therapist patient , may contribute favorable outcome type psychotherapy , include cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) drug dependence . Enhancement TA may possible intranasal administration hormone neurotransmitter oxytocin , associate social bonding trust . The objective study determine whether addition intranasal oxytocin course CBT drug dependence enhances TA treatment retention reduces drug use post-treatment . The study assess change performance task probe decision-making , emotional processing , drug-cue reactivity . We employ fMRI subset participant study neural correlate process . Study population . The treatment portion study conduct three parallel arm , intend statistically compare : ( 1 ) Outpatient Methadone arm ( physically dependent heroin user , n = 80 evaluable ) ; ( 2 ) Outpatient Cocaine arm ( cocaine-dependent individual , non-opiate-dependent , n = 80 evaluable ) ; 3 ) Inpatient Cocaine arm ( cocaine-dependent individual , non-opiate-dependent , n = 80 evaluable ) . There also two group non-treatment-seeking control ( 20 cocaine-using , 20 non-drug-using ) rule practice effect task ; control receive oxytocin CBT . Experimental design method . Primary outcome measure TA arm drug use methadone cocaine outpatient arm . ( 1 ) Methadone arm : 5-week baseline stabilization methadone , participant undergo 12 week CBT , random assignment oxytocin ( 24 IU , administer session ) placebo . ( 2 3 ) Cocaine arm , inpatient outpatient : 1-week baseline assessment drug use , participant undergo 6 12 week respectively CBT , random assignment oxytocin ( 24 IU , administer session ) placebo . Outcome measure : Principle outcome measure outpatient arm TA measure several point CBT , treatment retention , attendance CBT session . Secondary outcome measure drug use treatment follow-up , drug crave treatment follow-up , stress reduction treatment follow-up , HIV risk behavior treatment follow-up , behavioral performance various task , neural response task image subgroup . The outcome measure inpatient arm outpatient arm exception drug use treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must : 1 . Be age 18 65 . 2 . Methadone arm : opiate dependence past year determine clinical exam , opiatepositive urine screen diagnosis confirm SCID . 3 . Cocaine outpatient arm : cocaine dependence determine clinical exam , cocainepositive urine screen diagnosis confirm SCID . 4 . Cocaine inpatient arm : Cocaine dependence determine clinical exam screen diagnosis confirm SCID . 5 . Control participant : cocaine dependent nondrug use , recruit provide appropriate match subject two treatment arm respect follow characteristic : age , gender , IQ , socioeconomic factor , year education . 6 . Be free dependence substance except nicotine , heroin ( methadone arm ) , cocaine time participation . Justification : Dependence substance may result unique CNS deficit would confound result . Nicotine dependence allow nicotine use associate drug high normal usage prevalence nicotine dependence cocaine user may make impractical exclude nicotine user . While might preferable exclude individual whose use substances reach threshold abuse , inclusion individual necessarily contaminate data . Inpatient cocaine arm subject meet DSMIV TR criterion course specifier In Controlled Environment may history dependence substance cocaine admission inpatient treatment program . Assessment tool ( ) : SCID confirmation negative urine drug screen . For participation scan portion study , participant must also : 7 . Be ages 1855 . Justification : Many cognitive process study change age . In addition , risk difficulttodetect medical abnormality silent cerebral infarct increase age . Individuals 55 therefore exclude . Assessment tool ( ) : driver license , birth certificate , governmentissued form identification . 8 . Be good health . Justification : Many illness alter fMRI signal alter cognition . Assessment tool ( ) : Participants provide brief health history phone screening , undergo history physical examination qualify IRP clinician ( exam detail discuss reference specific exclusion criterion ) . 9 . Be righthanded . Justification : Many brain function assess protocol show evidence lateralize brain . In order reduce variability data , participant must righthanded . Assessment tool ( ) : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants exclude evidence : 1 . Schizophrenia DSMIV psychotic disorder ; history bipolar disorder ; current major depressive disorder . 2 . Current dependence alcohol sedativehypnotic , e.g . benzodiazepine ( DSMIV criterion ) , except inpatient cocaine arm . 3 . Cognitive impairment severe enough preclude informed consent valid response questionnaire . 4 . Renal insufficiency serum creatinine great 1.7 . 5 . Medical illness view investigator would compromise participation research : history syncope , family history sudden death , electrolyte imbalance , bradycardia , arrhythmia , mark sustained high BP SBP &gt; 160 DBP &gt; 100 two reading without 3rd read parameter stabilize antihypertension medication start study , congestive heart failure , history find screen EKG significant abnormality prolong QTc ( &gt; 450ms ) , AIDS HIV positive T cell count less equal 200 . 6 . Urologic condition would inhibit urine collection . 7 . Untreated Endocrine disorder . 8 . Pregnancy , plan become pregnant , breastfeed . In addition , woman childbearing age sexually active require use effective form birth control duration study . Effective form birth control include : 1. hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill , injectable hormone , vaginal ring hormone ) , 2. surgical sterility ( tubal ligation hysterectomy ) 3 . IUD 4 . Diaphragm spermicide 5 . Condom spermicide 9 . For methadone arm , use drug would interact methadone produce adverse effect Class I Class III antiarrhythmic , TCA , MAOI , calcium channel blocker , neuroleptic frequent use sedative hypnotic drug . Justification : Avoidance adverse interaction methadone . Assessment tool ( ) : Clinical interview tox screen . 10 . Use drug ( prostaglandin , vasoconstricting agent anesthetic medication , example ) may interact oxytocin . Justification : Avoidance adverse interaction oxytocin . Assessment tool ( ) : Clinical interview tox screen 11 . History hypersensitivity oxytocin vehicle , i.e . propylparahydroxybenzioate , methylparahydroxybenziate , chlorbutanol hemihydrate . Assessment tool : clinical interview 12 . Presence history clinically significant allergic rhinitis assess MRP PI . Justification : Inflammation nasal mucosa could interfere mucosal absorption intranasally administer OT . In addition , participant exclude fMRI scanning : 13 . Are suitable fMRI due pregnancy , implant metallic device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) , body morphology , claustrophobia . Justification : MR scan primary measurement tool use portion protocol . Assessment tool ( ) : Prospective participant fill MRI screen questionnaire undergo interview MR technologist . Pregnancy test perform female participant childbearing age experimental session . Questions concern suitability scanning refer MR Medical Safety Officer . Prospective participant question symptom claustrophobia place mock scanner screen visit ass possible difficulty tolerate confinement scanner ability physically fit scanner . 14 . Have coagulopathies , history current superficial deep vein thrombosis , musculoskeletal abnormality restrict ability lie flat extend period . Justification : MR scan session require participant lie flat back remain perfectly still approximately two hour . Therefore , condition would make difficult ( e.g . chronic back pain , significant scoliosis ) dangerous ( e.g . familial hypercoagulability syndrome , history thrombosis ) exclusionary . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , supplement trial lie mock scanner assess comfort issue . 15 . Have HIV syphilis . Justification : HIV syphilis CNS sequela , thus introduce unnecessary variability data . Assessment tool ( ) : HIV blood test , syphilis serology ( positive FTA ) . 16 . Have neurological illness . This include , limited , seizure disorder , migraine , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor . Justification : CNS diseases alter CNS function , possibly , neuronalvascular coupling form basis BOLD fMRI signal use study . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , urine drug screening anticonvulsant disclose history . History head trauma loss consciousness 5 minute postconcussive sequelae last two day , regardless loss consciousness , exclusionary . 17 . Regularly use prescription , overthecounter , herbal medication may alter CNS function , cardiovascular function , neuronalvascular coupling . Justification : Compounds alter BOLD signal alter primary measure use study . Assessment tool ( ) : History comprehensive urine drug screen detect use antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , barbiturate , common medication drug abuse . All participant fullfill criterion fMRI scan ask undergo scanning ; anticipate approximately 50 percent enrol participant scan .</criteria>
