	<brief_title>Long-term Comparison Stenting Versus Off-pump Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass surgery use heart lung machine ( on-pump surgery ) , associate risk peri-operative complication death , stroke , myocardial infarction , neurocognitive decline , extended hospitalization . Bypass surgery beat heart without use heart lung machine ( off-pump surgery ) reintroduce clinical practice order reduce complication . The Octopus cardiac wall stabilizer , develop UMC Utrecht , facilitate safe construction graft off-pump procedure . The expected advantage off-pump surgery e.g . less-invasiveness , complete arterial revascularization , faster recovery lower cost basis Octostent trial . We hypothesize off-pump surgical technique might offer alternative angioplasty bare-metal stent-implantation . The current study design randomize control multicenter trial compare two strategy .</detailed_description>
