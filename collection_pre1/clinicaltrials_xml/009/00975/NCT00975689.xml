	<brief_summary>Background : - Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ) genetic disorder result progressive loss nervous system function affect membrane nerve cell . There known cure NPC . - N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) drug approve Food Drug Administration use either orally IV treatment acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) poison aerosol reduce stickiness mucous patient cystic fibrosis . In body , NAC convert amino acid call cysteine , cell convert chemical call glutathione . Glutathione important help cell deal oxidative stress . Based number experiment cell , mouse patient NPC , believe oxidative stress increase NPC . If increase glutathione level , may able decrease oxidative stress . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness N-acetyl cysteine treat Niemann-Pick disease ( type C ) . Eligibility : - Individuals least 1 year age diagnose NPC . Design : - Patients enter study see National Institutes Health Clinical Center four time 20 week study . These admission occur start study week 8 , 12 , 20 . The first NIH visit last 2 day , visit last 1 day . - Patients participate two-stage study : period 8 week receive NAC second period 8 week receive placebo ( pill without NAC ) . Every patient participate study receive NAC one two time period . - The two treatment period separate wash-out period , 4 week patient receive neither NAC placebo . Patients also 4-week wash-out period begin study . Most physician-prescribed medication , seizure medication , allow . - During visit , examination , procedure , test do , include blood urine sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Validation Niemann-Pick Disease , Type C : Safety Efficacy N-Acetyl Cysteine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Niemann-Pick Disease , type C ( NPC ) autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease progressive neurodegeneration . It characterize intracellular accumulation cholesterol glycosphingolipids . The age onset variable case manifest infancy adulthood . Classically , initial neurological symptom observe early late childhood . Symptoms sign NPC include prolonged neonatal jaundice , splenomegaly , various neurological manifestation , especially ataxia , dysmetria , dysarthria , vertical supranuclear gaze palsy cognitive decline . Currently approve therapy NPC . A recent control study series case report suggest efficacy miglustat . Miglustat inhibit biosynthesis glycosphingolipids . The pathophysiological process contribute neurodegeneration NPC intensively study NPC mouse model . Potential pathological process include toxic effect cholesterol glycosphingolipid accumulation , deficient oxysterol production , peroxisomal dysfunction , mitochondrial dysfunction , perturb intracellular calcium homeostasis , inflammation , induction apoptosis , deficient neurosteroid synthesis , increase oxidative stress . The degree pathological process contribute pathology NPC known ; however , multiple process involve suggest combinatorial therapy address various aspect disorder necessary . A major impediment development clinical trial NPC prior lack outcome measure . Identifying biomarkers major goal NPC natural history trial ( 06-CH-0186 ) . We identify multiple biochemical abnormality cohort patient may prove useful biomarkers therapeutic trial . The next step attempt validate potential biomarkers therapeutic trial . Thus protocol plan evaluate safety efficacy N-acetylcysteine improve group biomarkers relate increase oxidative stress . The goal protocol : 1 . To validate use biomarkers therapeutic trial NPC . 2 . To evaluate safety N-acetylcysteine NPC patient . 3 . To evaluate efficacy N-acetylcysteine improve biomarkers associate increased oxidative stress NPC patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient establish diagnosis NPC consider study . The diagnosis may base upon either molecular biochemical testing . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diagnosis NPC cellular assay molecular testing . 2 . Twelve month age old weight great 10 kg . 3 . Patient must able take study medication orally per gastrostomy tube . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients exclude travel NIH medical condition ill care home . 2 . Patients exclude unable tolerate study procedure . 3 . Patients exclude pregnant ( negative urine pregnancy test require menstruate female participation study NIH Clinical Center admission ) . If sexually active , contraception must use duration study . 4 . Patients exclude prior allergic hypersensitivity symptom associate NAC use . 5 . Patients exclude study unwilling discontinue follow drug supplement duration study . . All dietary supplement b . Any antioxidant supplement prescribe study . This include dietary juice drink market source antioxidant c. CoQ10 supplement d. Any overthecounter medication use daily basis define clinical reason e. NAC use 6 . Physician prescribed medication review casebycase basis . Patients may exclude medical therapy could interfere study endpoint . Except carbamazepine , seizure control medication allow . Patients exclude take carbamazepine nitroglycerin . 7 . Overthecounter medication use daily basis review casebycase basis . Patients may exclude medical therapy could interfere study endpoint . 8 . Patients exclude uncontrolled seizure disorder . 9 . Patients miglustat start study exclude dose miglustat hold constant duration study . The miglustat dose must constant two month prior baseline NIH evaluation . Patients withdrawn initiate miglustat use enter study . 10 . Patient risk gastric hemorrhage ( preexist esophageal varix peptic ulcer disease ) . 11 . Patients sodium restrict diet medical reason . 12 . The following laboratory test abnormality exclude patient study : a. AST ALT elevate great 4fold upper limit normal . Note : NPC patient frequently transaminase level 23 fold normal . b . Anemia define two standard deviation normal age gender . c. Platelet count le 75,000. d. Elevated serum creatine level e. Hematuria proteinuria</criteria>
