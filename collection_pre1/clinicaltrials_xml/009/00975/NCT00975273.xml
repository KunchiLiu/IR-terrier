	<detailed_description>For randomize control treatment study , plan compare effect hypoventilation-based breathe training control intervention focus breathe regularity awareness . The two therapeutic procedure closely match important variable duration nature patient-therapist interaction , monitor asthma relate status medication intake , use scientific equipment monitoring device increase adherence , initial plausibility . Asthma patient evaluate , , directly , 1 month 6 month train . The primary goal training determine capnometry-assisted breathing training raise end-tidal CO2 produce improvement asthma control control train breathe awareness . The second goal determine capnometry-assisted breathe training raise pCO2 lead high pCO2 level train training three measure pCO2 ( 2-hour monitoring , standardized training session , homework assignment ) . The last objective determine clinical improvement asthma outcomes raise-pCO2 breathe group great patient improvement pCO2 .</detailed_description>
