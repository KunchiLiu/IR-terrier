	<detailed_description>Continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) methodology provide framework initiate sustain improvement complex systems.1 By definition , CQI engage frontline staff iterative problem solve use plan-do-study-act cycle learn , decision-making base real-time process measurement . The Institute Healthcare Improvement ( IHI ) sponsor Breakthrough Series ( BTS ) Collaboratives since 1996 accelerate uptake impact quality improvement . These collaboratives typically guide evidence-based clinical practice guideline , incorporate change methodology , rely clinical process improvement subject matter expert . Organizations adopt collaborative model , grow literature positive impact . This collaborative approach healthcare improvement appeal face validity lack definitive evidence effectiveness . A recent derivative collaboratives deployment tool kit quality improvement . Intuition suggest tool kit may help enable change , , thus agency advocate simpler approach disseminate tool kit change strategy . We seek compare collaborative model tool kit model improve care . Recommendations guideline central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) prevention implement reliably , result unnecessary ICU morbidity mortality foster national call improvement . Our study evaluate effect care process outcomes multi-institutional quality improvement initiative focus prevent CLABSI VAP intensive care unit ( ICU ) .</detailed_description>
