	<brief_summary>This 2-armed randomise controlled trial comparing surgery alone surgery plus post-operative radiation therapy patient completely resect primary melanoma show histological feature neurotropism . Uncontrolled study suggest form primary melanoma high risk local recurrence postoperative radiation therapy may substantially reduce risk . Patients eligible basis pathology excise melanoma offer opportunity take part trial . Those randomised receive radiation therapy treat simple technique encompass surgical bed plus margin . Radiation commence within 3 month surgery ( maximum 14 week surgery start radiotherapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Melanoma serious common malignancy Australia . It third common cancer Australia approximately 1000 Australians die disease year.At least quarter patient age 40 year . Neurotropism , define invasion melanoma peripheral neural tissue , feature disease may predispose towards high local recurrence rate . Local recurrence , particularly head neck region often require extensive , potentially morbid surgery . Neurotropism especially likely occur desmoplastic melanoma may high 40 - 60 % .6-8 Desmoplastic melanoma tend occur slightly old age group conventional type melanoma often occur head neck region individual chronic sun damage . The management localise neurotropic melanoma traditionally surgery . Recommendations surgical margin least 2 cm.There patient margin achievable due location tumour close important anatomical structure . Uncontrolled study suggest radiation therapy may reduce risk local recurrence patient although randomised trial confirm hypothesis . Postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy show randomised trial lead Australia , reduce regional recurrence rate nodal melanoma.There previously conduct randomise control trial address similar question neurotropic melanoma . The report relation retrospective review suggest benefit postoperative radiation therapy surgery . It unlikely trial do outside Australia . Hypotheses 1 . Radiation therapy surgery neurotropic melanoma improve local control . 2 . This achieve without significant increase treatment morbidity reduction quality life . Primary Objective • To determine , patient undergo surgery curative intent neurotropic melanoma , whether difference rate time local ( field ) recurrence patient treat post-operative radiation therapy initially observe . Secondary Objectives - To determine , patient , whether difference progression-free survival , pattern relapse overall survival patient treat surgery alone treat surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy . - To determine , patient , whether difference morbidity quality life patient treat surgery alone treat surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy Methodology This 2-armed randomise controlled trial comparing surgery alone surgery plus post-operative radiation therapy patient completely resect primary melanoma show histological feature neurotropism . Patients eligible basis pathology completely excise melanoma offer opportunity take part trial . Those randomised receive radiation therapy treat simple technique encompass surgical bed plus margin within 3 month surgery . The regimen use nodal trial use study . Patients observation arm subsequently recur field may offer surgery follow radiation therapy . Randomisation Methods Patients randomise ratio 1:1 two arm , radiation therapy radiation therapy . Allocation treatment arm stratify institution tumour site ( head neck ) use randomly permute block . Patients eligible basis pathology excise melanoma offer opportunity take part trial . While male female consider equally participation trial , way know ratio 1:1 .</detailed_description>
