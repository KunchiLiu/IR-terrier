	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) grow cause death , disability health care cost Canada . Nevertheless , COPD remain largely under-diagnosed under-treated , particularly early stage . Patients mild COPD variable respiratory symptom often go unrecognized caregiver . Recent study indicate even smoker near normal breathe test result extensive small airway disease/dysfunction rest , become pronounced stress exercise thus lead unpleasant breathing difficulty . This study seek well understand nature cause breathe discomfort activity limitation group patient mild COPD . The investigator compare detailed test small airway function conduct evaluation several key physiological parameter stress exercise patient mild COPD healthy , age-matched , non-smoking control subject . The investigator also compare detailed physiological response exercise condition chemical load mechanical unload respiratory system patient mild COPD . The propose study first systematically test hypothesis pathophysiological abnormality ventilatory demand , pulmonary gas exchange , small airway function , dynamic ventilatory mechanic respiratory muscle function contribute significantly exertional dyspnea activity-limitation patient mild COPD . This study first determine abnormality manipulate .</brief_summary>
