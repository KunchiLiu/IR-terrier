	<brief_summary>Does remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) induce brief period occlusion blood flow low extremity prior organ recovery decease donor , improve short long term outcome transplantation kidney , liver pancreas ? To test hypothesis decease organ donor randomize receive either RIPC No RIPC organ recovery . RIPC induce operating room commencement procurement surgery . RIPC induce tourniquet-induced occlusion blood flow low extremity 10 minute side , total duration 20 minute . The remainder organ recovery organ preservation per standard practice . Recovered liver , kidney pancreas transplant allocated recipient . Transplantation patient management transplantation per standard practice . Organ-specific function cell injury parameter utilized assess early postoperative outcome individual organ recipient . Long term outcome assess graft recipient survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deceased organ donor recipient kidney , liver pancreata study donor comprise study subject . I . DONORS I . A . Inclusion Criteria All decease organ donor age &gt; 5 year acute care hospital donor service area New Jersey Organ Tissue Sharing Network ( NJTO ) . I.B . Exclusion criteria 1 . Tissue donor 2 . Age &lt; 5 year 3 . When know organ recovery kidney leave New JerseyIntervention : RIPC induce inflation tourniquet around upper thigh 200 mm Hg period 10 minute . After tourniquet deflation one side , similar procedure follow immediately opposite side . Thus , total period 20 minute low extremity vascular occlusion utilized induce RIPC . In instance severe trauma one low extremity preclude tourniquet use , employ two cycle 10 minute tourniquet occlusion non-traumatized low extremity 10 min reperfusion . RIPC induce commencement procurement surgery complete 30-45 min circulatory arrest initiation organ perfusion . Additionally , liver biopsy ( wedge measure 0.75 x 0.75 cm Tru-cut needle biopsy right lobe ) perform soon abdomen open . A wedge ( 1 x 0.3 cm ) kidney biopsy perform donor kidney recovery packing organ . All biopsy except kidney biopsy donor age &lt; 50 year , per standard care . The remainder organ recovery , organ package preservation per standard practice . All kidney recover donor classify Extended Criteria Donors ( donor age &gt; 60 year age 50-59 year two follow three criteria- cerebrovascular cause death , history hypertension , terminal serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) routinely perfuse ex-vivo pulsatile hypothermic perfusion apparatus transplantation . . This may happen instance either excellent tissue match recipient outside New Jersey high risk behavior donor NJ kidney transplant center decline donor kidney organ recovery 4 . Deceased donor decision make recover kidney ( severe kidney disease , renal failure , etc ) 5 . Severe trauma low extremity preclude induction RIPC</detailed_description>

No kidney recipient enrol UH UH perform isolate kidney transplantation . Exclusion Criteria : All live donor kidney transplant perform participate kidney transplant center Recipients decease donor kidney import outside NJTO Recipients kidney decease donor &lt; 5 year age Recipients combine liver kidney transplantation , perform UH OLMC . The number transplant per year ( &lt; 5 ) . Also , clinical pathophysiological issue different require isolated kidney transplantation Recipients en bloc ( kidneys together one recipient ) kidney transplantation study donor . It anticipate instance per year ( &lt; 5 ) Recipients kidney decease donor enrol study due logistical reason . RECIPIENTS LIVER All recipients liver decease donor enrol study receive transplant either two liver transplant center New Jersey , UH OLMC . Live donor recipient Recipients liver import outside NJTO Recipients decease donor liver donor &lt; 5 year age Recipients liver decease donor enrol study due logistical reason RECIPIENTS PANCREAS All recipient solid organ pancreas ( isolated pancreas transplant combine kidney pancreas transplant ) decease donor enrol study receive transplant one four pancreas transplant center New Jersey , HUH , SBMC , RWJUH OLMC . NBIMC UH perform pancreas transplantation Exclusion Criteria Islet cell transplant recipients Recipients decease donor whole organ pancreas import outside NJ Recipients pancreas decease donor &lt; 5 year age Recipients pancreata decease donor enrol study due logistical reason</criteria>
