	<brief_summary>The purpose research study look new rehabilitation technique individual suffer stroke difficulty walk . This study design compare robot-assisted ( Lokomat ) rehabilitation therapy standard physical therapy order improve walk post-stroke . This research project conduct pilot randomize control trial compare effectiveness Lokomat versus conventional physical therapy improve ambulation gait chronic stroke patient . The project provide important pilot data could indicate whether effectiveness Lokomat training superior standard physical therapy definitive large clinical trial warrant .</brief_summary>
