	<brief_summary>According evidence , though exact mechanism contribute Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) associate peripheral edema still unclear , investigator hypothesize genetic variation certain candidate gene involve peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gamma PPAR gamma-regulated gene may contribute TZDs-associated peripheral edema . Therefore , investigator plan conduct case-control study test association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) certain candidate gene TZDs relate peripheral edema . A large fraction individual , type 2 diabetes ( 38-41 ) risk type 2 diabetes , respond TZD therapy . In individual type 2 diabetes , non-response carefully characterize , data study at-risk individual suggest lack improvement insulin sensitivity ( Si ) may account lack response TZD therapy . In Troglitazone In Prevention Of Diabetes ( TRIPOD ) study , around 30 % treated woman show improvement Si ; gain protection type 2 diabetes compare placebo group . Assessment baseline clinical physiologic measurement reveal similar level adiposity , fast glucose insulin , Si β-cell function , fast lipid , contraceptive use , compliance study medication responder nonresponders , suggest measure predict TZD response . The adipose tissue-derived hormone adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity circulating level decrease obesity induce insulin resistance . In ob/ob mouse lack adiponectin , ability PPARγ agonist , TZDs , improve glucose tolerance diminish . It imply adiponectin important contributor PPARγ-mediated improvement glucose tolerance mechanism involve activation AMPK pathway . On hand , show FOXO1 repress PPARγ1 γ2 promoter primary adipocytes . It also report peroxisome proliferators activate receptor-γ coactivator-1α ( PGC-1α ) gene expression brown white adipocytes direct target TZDs activator retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) . Taken together , FOXO1 PGC-1α potentially play important role antidiabetic action TZDs . In summary , though TZDs widely use patient type 2 diabetes mellitus , patient experience TZD-related peripheral edema patient good responsiveness TZDs . The underlying contributing factor molecular mechanism clearly elucidate . In study , investigator identify contribute factor TZD-related peripheral edema responsiveness TZDs . The investigator also identify association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) certain candidate gene TZD relate peripheral edema responsiveness TZDs . It may identify clinical pharmacogenetic factor predict occurrence TZD-related edema responsiveness TZDs .</brief_summary>
