	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increase risk development atherosclerosis . Recently , atherosclerosis image 18F-FDG PET ( 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ) useful track inflammation within plaque monitoring response drug therapy The purpose study determine whether FDG-PET capable detect atherosclerotic vascular inflammation monitor early effect statins type 2 diabetic patient . The usefulness FDG-PET risk stratification also investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The early detection vulnerable plaque clinically important risk stratification also provide early treatment . Inflammation important pathogenesis outcome atherosclerosis . Plaques contain numerous inflammatory cell , particular macrophage , high risk rupture . Diabetes major risk factor development atherosclerosis . Lipid-lowering therapy statins significantly decrease cardiovascular morbidity mortality primary secondary prevention . Statin exert benefit inhibition de novo cholesterol synthesis , result significant reduction plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level . It remain controversial whether LDL-C lower mechanism observe beneficial effect . Many LDL-C-independent pleiotropic effect postulate . Moreover , Lipid lower therapy may affect atherosclerosis also inhibition inflammatory marker . These evidence highlight possibility statin could great impact plaque inflammation . 18FDG glucose analogue take cell proportion metabolic activity . Several paper report potential role metabolic image assessment inflammatory vascular disease , especially large vessel . If , FDG-PET monitor direct effect statins vascular inflammation . Additionally , monitor vascular inflammation FDG-PET may useful determine risk stratification atherosclerotic patient . The investigator hypothesize statins-induced attenuation vascular inflammation could monitor clinically use FDG-PET approach , provide information early efficacy statin therapy cause stabilization vulnerable plaque without affect lumen size .</detailed_description>
