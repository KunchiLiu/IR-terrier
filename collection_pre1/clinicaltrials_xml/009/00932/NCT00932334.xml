	<brief_summary>Title : Culturally tailor behavioral intervention enhance live kidney donation/living kidney transplantation Applicants : Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions , National Kidney Foundation Maryland Principal Investigator : Neil R. Powe , MD , MPH , MBA Address : 2024 E. Monument Street , Suite 2-600 , Baltimore , MD , 21205 Phone : 410-955-6953 ; Email : npowe @ jhmi.edu ; Fax : 410-955-0476 Rates kidney donation largely stagnant past 10 year , result large imbalance number person transplant wait list number person receive kidney transplant . Slow improvement donation transplantation rate exacerbate ethnic/racial disparity kidney transplant , minority , particularly African Americans , far less likely receive decease kidney transplant . Although living relate kidney donation ( LD ) offer patient opportunity bypass many barrier contribute disparity kidney transplantation ( e.g . wait list immunological incompatibility issue ) , African Americans remain less likely receive living relate kidney transplant ( LRT ) , exacerbate disparity transplant rate . Recent research demonstrate many ethnic minority desire kidney transplantation , rate patient-physician patient-family discussion regard LD/LRT suboptimal . Compared Whites , African Americans also show disproportionately great rate culture-specific concern ( mistrust health care ) could impede seek important medical therapy . It unknown whether culturally tailor behavioral intervention enhance patient/family decision-making regard LD/LRT onset end stage renal disease could improve rate LD/LRT could narrow racial disparity receipt transplantation . The primary goal proposal ) use focus group methodology develop culturally tailor educational material patients/families consider LD/LRT b ) perform randomize control trial test effectiveness culturally tailor social-worker lead intervention ( use establish behavioral problem-solving therapeutic technique ) enhance rate family communication , donor evaluation , transplantation . The substantial experience consortium , include National Kidney Foundation Maryland Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions ( Welch Center Medical Surgical Transplant Services School Medicine ) , evaluation/ implementation donor/recipient educational program well conduct behavioral , epidemiologic interventional study relate donor/recipient health psychology provide strong foundation conduct study .</brief_summary>
