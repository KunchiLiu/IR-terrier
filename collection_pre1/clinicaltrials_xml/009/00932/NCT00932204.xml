	<brief_summary>The purpose present study investigate possible therapeutic effect safety sequentially combine low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) supplementary motor area ( SMA ) patient treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sequentially Applied Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Obsessive- Compulsive Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) relatively common psychiatric disorder characterize repetitive , intrusive thought time-consuming behavioral mental act . Many OCD patient respond conventional treatment experience severe distress disruption daily activity . Novel approach include psychopharmacological therapy surgical technique treatment-resistant OCD propose . With recent advance non-invasive technique stimulate cerebral cortex , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) propose potential therapeutic approach various psychiatric illness include OCD . Because contradictory finding lack control trial OCD , rTMS yet recommend routine therapy OCD . However , may potential clinical effect putative add-on treatment OCD alternative therapy treatment-resistant OCD . For useful clinical application , important develop method enhance efficacy rTMS . There number putative way , one sequentially combine two form stimulation consider potential therapeutic effect . More recently , sequential application two stimulation regimen ( high-frequency left-side rTMS low-frequency right-side rTMS prefrontal cortex ) find substantial therapeutic effect patient treatment-resistant major depression . Therefore , investigation sequentially combine effect right prefrontal SMA stimulation would worthwhile OCD patient .</detailed_description>
