	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess weight change population Veterans amputation . Little known weight change follow amputation . It widely believe many patient experience weight gain follow amputation . This study aim identify magnitude weight change follow amputation determine characteristic associate weight gain . Information weight change trajectory would useful good understand long-term health consequence associate amputation design target intervention encourage weight maintenance general health promotion group high risk weight gain .</brief_summary>
