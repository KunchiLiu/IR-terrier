	<brief_title>CY-503 Treatment Chemotherapy-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer worldwide annual incidence approximately 1 million new case diagnose yearly second lead cause cancer-related death Western nation . There couple approve standard therapy treatment MCRC cytotoxic agent irinotecan , oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidines , well bevacizumab , antibody vascular endothelial growth factor A , cetuximab , antibody epidermal growth factor receptor . But study achieve median survival time 20 month MCRC patient standard regimen . After 1st line therapy high proportion ( 50 % 80 % ) patient receive 2nd line therapy drug use 1st line therapy part get 3rd line treatment . Results 2nd line therapy best response rate range 4 % - 23 % , median PFS rate 5.1 month , median TTP 4.1 - 4.6 month median overall survival 6.9 - 12 month . However , patient experience disease progression standard therapy ( definition see inclusion criterion ) standard therapeutic option . These patient develop resistance therapy finally die disease . They generally get best supportive care ( BSC ) . Thus , need new active treatment option set . In phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial efficacy safety CY-503 , 350 ng s.c. inject patient chemotherapy refractory MCRC test . Approved treatment give MCRC patient usually discontinue treatment week first detection objective PD . It test CY-503 able achieve progression-free-survival ( PFS ) comparison placebo . Patients initially include receive either CY-503 placebo documentation objective PD . Standard therapy must finish show objective PD . Also patient contraindication standard therapy include . CY-503 show potential improve treatment MCRC . This study aim evaluate activity therapeutic effect substance . Anticipated capability substitution cytostatic drug improvement efficacy tolerability . Furthermore , expect improvement PFS rate failure standard chemotherapy investigate . In phase I trial CY-503 show SD patient exhaust standard therapy option metastatic disease subsequent disease progression median TTP 17.4 week .</detailed_description>
