Patients progress prior chemotherapy metastatic recurrent NSCLC . Must postmenopausal female , define follow criterion : Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age great 60 year old Age le 60 year old amenorrheic 12 month absence chemotherapy ovarian suppression FSH estradiol postmenopausal range . Registration/randomization within 6 week begin last cycle chemotherapy Documented evidence tumor response CR , PR , SD . Tumor assessment must occur Cycle 4 ( Day 1 ) induction therapy date randomization . Tumor assessment per RECIST ( Appendix 3 ) treat physician . This response confirm order patient randomize ; however , unconfirmed response stratify stable disease stratum . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan ultrasound may use lesion measurement response determination ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . At least 18 year age . Adequate organ function , include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) great equal 1.0 x10^9/L , platelet great equal 75 x10^9/L , hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL . Hepatic : bilirubin le equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) less equal 2.0 Renal : calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) â‰¥45 mL/min base standard Cockcroft Gault formula ( Cockcroft Gault 1976 ) . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 3 week study enrollment . Patients must recover acute toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment . Signed informed consent document file . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate follow . Patient must receive onstudy therapy earlier 21 day later 42 day last cycle ( Day 1 ) induction therapy . Patients must archival tissue sample . Tumor tissue submit assessment ERa , ERb , PR , VEGF aromatase expression . The patient must also agree mandatory correlative blood sample baseline , 5 week , 9 week , 13 week time progression . Cisplatin may use instead carboplatin part initial induction chemotherapy regimen , discretion treat physician investigator .
