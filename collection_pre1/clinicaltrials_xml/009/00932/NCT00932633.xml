	<brief_summary>Infants congenital heart disease ( CHD ) require surgery frequently brain injury see magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This occur approximately 40 % newborn , even though full-term infant , injury see closely resembles form brain injury see premature baby . Much like premature newborn , infant CHD also long-term neurodevelopmental problem ( 50 % ) . The investigator know infant CHD get specific form brain injury . One risk factor felt inflammation occurs response heart-lung bypass ( cardiopulmonary bypass , CPB ) , necessary feature open-heart surgery . Newborns strong inflammatory reaction CPB old child adult . The investigator know animal experiment human data inflammation harmful develop brain . The investigator hypothesize child CHD require surgery newborn brain injury due toxicity inflammatory response . The investigator test enrol newborn undergo heart surgery measure marker inflammation , measure brain injury MRI , test developmental outcome 1 2 year age . An association inflammation injury might impact medicine choose protect brain future study , even population preterm infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Evaluate Brain Injury Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Term infant congenital heart disease ( CHD ) require neonatal surgery unusual susceptibility white matter injury ( WMI ) , neuropathology typically see preterm infant . The mechanism brain injury unclear . Newborns CHD may experience dramatic peri-operative inflammatory response critical period neurodevelopment . Experimental model suggest certain pro-inflammatory cytokine toxic develop oligodendrocyte , result white matter pathology . The consequence exposure systemic inflammatory response ( SIR ) group patient unknown ; however , neuroimaging abnormality ( see approximately 40 % ) neurodevelopmental impairment ( note approximately 50 % ) well establish child CHD . We hypothesize term newborn complex CHD require neonatal surgery WMI due neurotoxicity profound peri-operative inflammatory response . These hypothesis test prospective longitudinal study characterize SIR ( Aim 1 ) heterogeneous group congenital lesions/surgeries , ass brain injury post-operative period ( Aim 2 ) , asses neurodevelopment outcomes 1 2 year ( Aim 3 ) , determine whether inflammation play mechanistic role ( Aim 2a , 3a ) .</detailed_description>
