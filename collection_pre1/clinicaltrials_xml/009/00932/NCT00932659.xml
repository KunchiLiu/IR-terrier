	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis patient rate fatal arrhythmia 40 time great general population , cause type fatal arrhythmias experience unclear . The purpose prospective observational cohort study capture characterize occult arrhythmia occur hemodialysis patient 6 month period . After informed consent baseline assessment , 30 adult hemodialysis patient without prior history cardiac arrhythmia undergo implantation continuous cardiac monitoring device ( REVEAL , Medtronic ) . Three followup visit schedule download device data quantify number potentially malignant arrhythmia occur study subject 6 month period . Additionally , capture event monitor remotely via regular patient initiate transmission device data every 2 week . Any serious occult arrhythmia detect immediately act upon predefined management algorithm . Descriptive data simple proportion use describe incidence type arrhythmias among study cohort . Risks study include 1 ) potential loss patient confidentiality 2 ) risk relate insertion device include pocket hematoma , device infection , pain discomfort secondary procedure . These minimized strict security measure protect patient 's protected health information ( PHI ) , preprocedural screen insertion monitor device highly trained operator , frequent careful direct patient followup .</brief_summary>
