	<brief_title>Determining Efficacy Value Immunotherapy Likelihood Peanut Tolerance : The DEVIL Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy know cause severe anaphylactic reaction . Compared food allergy , tend persistent prevalence seem rise . Currently , proven treatment strict avoidance . We attempt decrease risk anaphylaxis accidental ingestion desensitize subject peanut use peanut mucosal immunotherapy ( PMIT ) . We also study effect PMIT peanut-specific immune response determine tolerance peanut protein develop . Based preliminary work recent study support importance early oral exposure tolerance induction , propose early treatment peanut allergy PMIT safe effective . Children age 9 36 month peanut allergy randomize receive high low dose PMIT use peanut flour . Peanut-allergic subject receive intervention serve control . Subjects undergo desensitization first day increase dose gradually maintenance dose . Doses take daily home except dose increase do research unit . Subjects undergo double-blinded , placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) challenge criterion meet . Subjects pass first challenge stop PMIT repeat DBPCFC ass tolerance . Outcome variables interest include response oral food challenge ( OFC ) , skin prick testing , peanut specific serum immunoglobin E ( IgE ) , immunoglobin G ( IgG ) , immunoglobin G4 ( IgG4 ) stool immunoglobin A ( IgA ) , T B cell response , quality life , adverse event . These longitudinal result compare high low dose PMIT group control use appropriate statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
