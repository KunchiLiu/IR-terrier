Before initiation study , Danish part team Danish Cancer Society teach investigate team take penile swab do way do recent Danish male study . DATA COLLECTION We choose HPV strategy match strategy use female Tanzanian study previously use Danish male study , namely initial test HC2 follow genotyping sample positive HC2 high-risk ( HR ) type and/ low-risk ( LR ) type . HPV DNA prevalence : HPV sample obtain rub moist cotton swab glans penis ( include sulcus coronarius underneath preputium ) , penile shaft , scrotum perineum follow loosen cell nail file . This procedure adapt Merck male clinical study .

The HPV sample Tanzanian men send currier Prof. Iftners laboratory Germany test HPV mean Hybrid Capture 2 ( HC2 ) method ( Digene ) , low-risk high-risk probe . HPV type distribution : HPV genotyping perform use Papillocheck - DNA-Chip analysis type-specific identification 18 high-risk 6 low-risk type HPV . Alternatively funding allows , use reverse hybridization line probe assay test ( LiPa test ) Innogenetics ( expensive , slightly sensitive Papillocheck test , another advantage use test Danish HPV study 2,500 men ) . The test strategy genotype HC2 positive ( HR positive and/or LR positive ) sample . Assessment HIV status : An HIV test offer men enrol study perform take account individual person 's wish test informed HIV status . HIV antibody presence whole blood sample assess follow WHO approve HIV serial test algorithm . Initially , Bioline HIV-1/2 immunodetection use , subsequently follow Determine HIV-1/2 test order confirm Bioline potentially positive result . Assessment risk factor associate HPV infection : A structured interview focus socio-economic characteristic , circumcision status , sexual activity , STI history knowledge HPV HPV/ cancer relationship , conduct .</detailed_description>
