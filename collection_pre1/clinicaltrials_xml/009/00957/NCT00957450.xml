	<brief_summary>Patients cervix cancer radiotherapy experience side-effects radiotherapy field quite large account tumour movement pelvis treatment , irradiate lot normal tissue . This study aim characterize model tumour motion , well motion surround normal tissue , treatment . By , investigator look way minimise tumour motion spare normal tissue . By tailor radiotherapy dose accurately , investigator reduce side-effects treatment improve local control tumour . By multiple magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan patient treatment , investigator identify tumour surround normal tissue point time . Collecting information scan , allow investigator model motion tumour pelvic organ , investigate best way target tumour still spar normal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-Pelvic Organ Motion Cervix Cancer Patient Using Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At simulation : patient two MRI scan addition standard planning CT scan . One MRI scan bladder full , bladder empty . During treatment : patient two three MRI scan per week convenience . MRI scan schedule close radiotherapy treatment time minimise inconvenience patient . On day MRI scan , also CBCT time treatment . None image use alter influence treatment patient receiving . If patient feel image schedule inconvenient , give option reduce frequency scan withdraw study.All image load onto password secure server . The MRI scan fuse plan CT scan use bone-to-bone matching . Tumour intra-pelvic organ contour MRI scan . The contour use create surface mesh organ research software , able model motion deformation organ course radiotherapy . Using data , able simulate dose impact organ motion different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan . We also explore impact bladder &amp; rectal filling tumour motion .</detailed_description>
