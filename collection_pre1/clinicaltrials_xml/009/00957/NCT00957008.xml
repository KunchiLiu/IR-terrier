	<brief_summary>Although weight loss program effective short-term , maintain weight loss challenging . Regularly track log physical activity ( PA ) diet relate great improvement PA diet great weight loss time . Receiving continuous real-time feedback regard calorie burn calorie consume could enhance weight loss maintenance . This study examine whether device provide feedback , call SenseWear armband , enhances weight maintenance . 200 overweight adult age 18 65 year randomly assign one four group : ( 1 ) standard behavior change weight loss group-based program ( 14 group session 4 month period follow 6 phone call 5 month period ) , ( 2 ) standard behavior change weight loss group-based program ( 15 group session 4 month period follow 6 phone call 5 month period ) combine armband , ( 3 ) armband alone ( train use armband follow telephone call ) , ( 4 ) self-directed weight loss control group . Participants recruit USC listserv email , flyer , worksite advertisement . Interested individual take part telephone screen , orientation , run-in visit ( include 2 week PA dietary logging ) , baseline assessment , randomization visit . The intervention take place 9-month period eligible participant . Participants take part follow-up assessment month 4 9 . Assessments three time include questionnaire assess diet , PA , psychosocial factor relate diet PA , quality life related measure .

	<detailed_description>Use Electronic Feedback Diet Physical Activity Enhance Weight Management Research Summary Steven N. Blair , PED , Principal Investigator Primary Aim Dr. Blair investigative team evaluate contribution BodyMedia metabolic monitoring system weight loss within context standard behavioral weight loss program , also stand alone system . The BodyMedia system consist metabolic monitor ( armband ) computer software analyze energy expenditure , duration level physical activity , metabolic process free-living condition . The propose study test follow hypothesis : 1 . The standard behavioral weight loss program ( Standard ) , BodyMedia augment program ( Armband ) , Armband Alone produce weight loss reduction waist circumference 4 month maintain great weight loss reduction waist circumference usual care self-help program ( Usual Care ) . 2 . The Armband program produce weight loss reduction waist circumference comparable Standard program 4 month . 3 . The Armband Alone program produce weight loss reduction waist circumference comparable Standard program 9 month . 4 . The Armband program produce weight loss reduction waist circumference great Standard program 9 month . Primary Outcomes 1 . Body weight 2 . Waist circumference Secondary Outcomes 1 . Weekly energy expenditure physical activity . 2 . Weekly caloric intake . 3 . Percent participant lose ≥5 % baseline body weight . 4 . Stages Motivational Readiness physical activity diet change . Tertiary Outcomes 1 . Blood pressure . 2 . Fasting lipid profile . 3 . Fasting blood glucose . 4 . Fasting blood insulin 5 . Quality life . Study Design The design randomize control trial four arm : 1 . Standard behavioral weight loss intervention program . 2 . Armband ( standard behavioral weight loss intervention program augment use BodyMedia armband monitoring system reinforce support making change behavior ) . 3 . Armband Alone include one-hour orientation baseline use armband , one week follow-up telephone call answer question . 4 . Usual care ( self-help diet physical activity manual provide guidance change behavior ) . Fifty participant assign study arm . The Standard Armband group participate weekly group counsel session four month . During month 5-7 study staff contact participant weekly via email telephone monitor report dietary physical activity logging , provide counsel support necessary . During month 8 9 , contact monthly . For Armband Alone group , study staff make monthly contact telephone email answer question provide encouragement . Data collection outcome occur baseline , 4 month ( blood chemistry analyse perform 4 month ) , 9 month . Participants recruit study several month , participant complete follow-up ( month 9 ) data collection end 18-month study period .</detailed_description>
