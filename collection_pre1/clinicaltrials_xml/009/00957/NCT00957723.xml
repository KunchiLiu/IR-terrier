	<brief_title>Triathlon速 Cruciate Retaining ( CR ) Total Knee System Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Triathlon速 Cruciate Retaining ( CR ) Total Knee System component use cement total knee arthroplasty painful , disable joint disease knee result non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease ( include osteoarthritis , traumatic arthritis avascular necrosis ) rheumatoid arthritis ( exclude study accord protocol ) . The component design improve range motion ( ROM ) stability . This study serve demonstrate subject reduce pain , increase ROM improved stability follow implantation Triathlon Cruciate Retaining ( CR ) Total Knee System compare historical control .</detailed_description>
