	<brief_summary>The main purpose project cure patient high risk Sickle cell disease red cell disorder include thalassemia diamond-blackfan anemia bone marrow transplantation . The patient enrol study lack match sibling donor therefore option undergo bone marrow transplantation use match unrelated bone marrow umbilical cord blood national marrow donor program registry . Since bone marrow transplantation disorder use match unrelated donor two major problem i.e . engraftment , , process new marrow accept allow grow patient ; graft-versus-host disease , process new marrow `` reject '' host patient , study devise method overcome two problem thus make transplantation unrelated donor successful term engraftment safe term side effect , acute long term . In order accomplish two goal , two important thing do . Firstly , patient get three medicine consider reduced intensity know cause serious organ damage see conventional chemotherapy . These medicine , however , cause intense immune suppression cause increase infection . Secondly , addition transplantation bone marrow unrelated donor , patient also transplant mesenchymal stromal cell derive bone marrow parent . Mesenchymal stromal cell adult stem cell normally find bone marrow think create right background blood cell grow . They show many animal human study improve engraftment . In addition , special property prevent even consider treat graft versus host disease . Therefore , use reduce intensity chemotherapy regimen transplant transplant mesenchymal stromal cell , hope improve engraftment time decrease potential severe side effect associate conventional transplant use extremely high dos chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
