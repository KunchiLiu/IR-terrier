	<brief_summary>Early diagnosis one important factor survival patient diagnose breast cancer . To aid early detection breast cancer , new technology , call tomosynthesis imaging develop . The idea behind tomosynthesis image `` look '' breast different point view obtain x-ray flat image different angle breast move , mathematically combine flat image three-dimensional image . The benefit three dimensional image radiologist look different tissue breast real position , oppose tissue `` flatten '' flat image , like normal mammogram . Since tomosynthesis image breast show tissue real position , radiologist able easily find tumor also able reduce number time think tumor present reality one . Before new technology use clinic routinely , necessary perform large number study find optimal way use . In study , investigator aim find thick slice layer represent breast image show radiologist . The difference two thickness useful image radiologist could important . The investigator try determine slice image breast thicker slice make job radiologist easy decide recommend biopsy ( laboratory analysis ) previous mammogram find . To find answer question , investigator image patient tomosynthesis machine look tomosynthesis image thin thick slice . The radiologist read image decide would recommend patient get biopsy base image . The recommendation base image thin slice recommendation base image thick slice compare actually recommend use standard clinical test . The investigator hope find thicker slice help thinner slice try decide biopsy need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early diagnosis one important factor survival patient diagnose breast cancer . To aid early detection breast cancer , new technology , call tomosynthesis imaging develop . The idea behind tomosynthesis image `` look '' breast different point view obtain x-ray flat image different angle breast move , mathematically combine flat image three-dimensional image . The benefit three dimensional image radiologist look different tissue breast real position , oppose tissue `` flatten '' flat image , like normal mammogram . The flat image mammograms bring possibility normal healthy tissue sometimes cover malignant tumor , make harder , sometimes impossible , physician see . In addition , `` flattening '' sometimes generate appear suspicious tissue , reality superposition normal healthy tissue . This effect result perform increased number biopsy end negative breast cancer . Since tomosynthesis image breast show tissue real position , effect avoid . It already show various research lab , include , kind image fact result good visualization lesion compare conventional two-dimensional imaging , even without perform tomosynthesis ideal condition . For tomosynthesis reach full potential , necessary perform large number study find optimal way acquire tomosynthesis image optimal way mathematically combine image get three dimensional image . In study , aim find result three dimensional image divide slice layer represent 1 millimeter ( less one 16th inch ) breast 5 millimeter ( one 5th inch ) breast . The difference two thickness useful image radiologist could important . Up , tomosynthesis imaging perform 1 millimeter slice , scientific study prove best slice thickness . We try determine slice image breast thicker slice make job radiologist easy decide recommend biopsy ( laboratory analysis ) previous mammogram find . To find answer question , image patient tomosynthesis machine look tomosynthesis image thin thick slice . The radiologist read image decide would recommend patient get biopsy base image . The recommendation base image thin slice recommendation base image thick slice compare actually recommend use standard clinical test . We hope show image thick slice well well thin slice . Even thick slice well thin slice , show create image thicker slice well , since image read faster radiologist .</detailed_description>
