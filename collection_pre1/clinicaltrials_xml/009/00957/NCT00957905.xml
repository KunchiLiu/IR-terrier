	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study alvocidib oxaliplatin see well work give without fluorouracil leucovorin calcium treat patient relapsed refractory germ cell tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , alvocidib , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving alvocidib together oxaliplatin without fluorouracil leucovorin calcium may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alvocidib Oxaliplatin With Without Fluorouracil Leucovorin Calcium Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor efficacy combination flavopiridol oxaliplatin without 5-FU leucovorin patient relapse refractory GCT . The necessity 5-FU leucovorin combination also indirectly test study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety flavopiridol combination oxaliplatin without 5-fluorouracil leucovorin patient refractory relapse GCT . II . To evaluate time tumor response ( TTR ) progression-free survival patient refractory relapse GCT treat flavopiridol combination oxaliplatin without 5-fluorouracil leucovorin . III . To explore association treatment response p21 , p53 apoptotic marker . OUTLINE : Patients initially enrol part A ( closed accrual 11/15/2010 ) . Depending response treatment , additional patient may enrol part B . PART A ( alvocidib oxaliplatin ) ( close accrual 11/15/2010 ) : Patients receive alvocidib IV 1 hour oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART B ( alvocidib FOLFOX ) : Patients receive alvocidib IV 1 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour follow fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample may collect periodically laboratory analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4-8 week .</detailed_description>
