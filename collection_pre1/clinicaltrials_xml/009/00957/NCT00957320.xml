	<brief_summary>The goal study find safe dose sirolimus use standard dose L-asparaginase . To find safe dose , investigator give first patient small dose sirolimus ( small dose use organ transplant child ) standard dose L-asparaginase . The investigator look side effect . If side effect develop , investigator decrease dose sirolimus . If , investigator increase dose sirolimus next patient study . The investigator continue method few one-third patient side effect would require stopping drug change dose . The investigator plan enroll 15 child relapse ALL . The enrolled patient must recover treatment start study . Also , severe side effect earlier therapy possibly make drug less safe . The investigator collect information whether drug help cure ALL , purpose find dose sirolimus cause many side effect combine L-asparaginase . This explained family sign write consent . The patient provide either verbal write assent appropriate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sirolimus With PEG-Asparaginase Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) poor cure rate , standard care treatment patient . Therefore , want combine two chemotherapy drug see safe help treat patient . The first agent , L-asparaginase , use patient initial treatment ALL . The second agent , sirolimus , cause death human leukemia cell laboratory . Sirolimus also use child receive kidney heart transplant prevent organ rejection . Therefore , safety side effect well know child . There many step allow cancer cell grow human . L-asparaginase sirolimus block two different step cell growth . Because , anticipate two drug work together lead cancer cell death . The first part study last 1 month patient . If patient good response two drug , allow continue drug 12 month . They continue dose sirolimus receive first month remain time study . We also look way leukemia cell respond medication laboratory . We draw blood bone marrow sample patient unless already need procedure do test . The amount extra blood bone marrow drawn cause patient harm . As know laboratory test mean , tell patient result study .</detailed_description>
