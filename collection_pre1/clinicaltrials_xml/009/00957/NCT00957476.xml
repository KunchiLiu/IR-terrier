	<detailed_description>In addition increase obesity adult child , significant increase birth weight last 2 decade . Based preliminary data , maternal pre-gravid obesity strong risk factor neonatal well adolescent obesity . The long-term goal research examine therapeutic strategy decrease fetal adiposity . Obesity pregnancy insulin resistant condition associate chronic low-grade inflammation . Therefore , hypothesize n-3 PUFA dietary supplement pregnancy act insulin sensitizer decrease peripheral insulin resistance inflammation . If correct mechanism decrease availability maternal nutrient fetus subsequently reduce adiposity birth . We plan prospective randomize double blind control trial n-3 PUFA supplementation placebo overweight/obese woman , previous cesarean delivery , initiate early pregnancy maintain throughout pregnancy . This proposal two specific aim . Specific aim 1 evaluate effect n-3 PUFA supplementation maternal insulin sensitivity . Measures maternal insulin sensitivity lipid metabolism make use ISogtt , indirect calorimetry body composition ( BODPOD ) plasma lipid profile baseline dietary intervention . Specific aim 2 assess effect n-3 PUFA inflammatory status overweight/obese pregnant woman . We hypothesize n-3 PUFA supplementation decrease chronic inflammation pregnancy prevent monocyte activation accumulation macrophage WAT thus lower systemic concentration pro-inflammatory cytokine . We plan characterize longitudinal change circulate monocyte plasma adipokines order define inflammatory pattern group time . We also determine abundance phenotype macrophage infiltrate WAT use flow cytometry , immunohistochemistry gene expression profile . Furthermore , role PPARγ central target n-3 PUFA action regulate insulin sensitivity examine characterize expression PPARγ WAT supplement control group . Additionally , investigate direct affect n-3 PUFA expression adiponectin PPARγ regulate gene primary culture adipocytes . In summary , proposal combine clinical molecular methodology overweight/obese subject population order assess effect n-3 PUFA inflammation insulin resistance . Preliminary data also obtain fetal body composition order later address prevention long term adverse effect ( developmental programming ) maternal obesity develop fetus .</detailed_description>

This due placebo group receive fish oil outside study . Daily use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent Allergy fish fish product , gluten intolerant ( placebo contain wheat germ oil , gluten free ) . Women vegetarians eat fish . Infants born preterm ( le 36 week gestation ) less 2kg . Heparin use know thrombophilia ( thrombophilias include homozygous Factor V Leiden ) . Moderate high titer IgG anticardiolipin antibody prolong activate PTT indication presence lupus anticoagulant , homozygous prothrombin gene ( G20210A ) mutation , antithrombin III deficiency . Protein S ( low level outside pregnancy ) Protein C deficiency . Hyperhomocysteinemia ( due safety concern n3 may affect bleed time ) . Hemophiliacs include von Willebrand 's disease ( safety concern associate hemophilia treatment combine n3 supplement ) . Planned termination pregnancy . Current hypertension current use antihypertensive medication ( include diuretic ) , due increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome . Pregestational diabetes due increase risk affect fetal growth . We exclude woman develop GDM pregnancy consider subanalyses woman depend number subject . Known maternal medical complication : cancer ( include melanoma exclude skin cancer ) . Current hyperthyroidism adequately control . Renal disease alter renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ) . Epilepsy seizure disorder . Systemic lupus ( discoid lupus ) , scleroderma , polymyalgia rheumatic . Active liver disease ( acute hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , persistently abnormal liver enzyme ) . Platelet red blood cell disorder ( include idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura , history alloimmune thrombocytopenia previous offspring , significant anemia due hemoglobinopathy sickle cell trait . Iron deficiency anemia NOT exclusion long hemoglobin &gt; 8 gm/dl ) . Chronic pulmonary disease ( asthma degree severity NOT exclusion ) . Structural , functional ischemic heart disease . Neither mitral valve prolapse paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia consider exclusion . Known HIV positive viral load great 1,000 copies/ml CD4 count less 350/mm3 . Current planned cerclage due interference natural cause delivery . Illicit drug alcohol abuse current pregnancy . At time birth , infant evaluate pediatrician make sure healthy . Infants exclude study medical problem respiratory distress syndrome . Infants also exclude problem exclude estimation body composition , e.g . birth weight less 2 kg .</criteria>
