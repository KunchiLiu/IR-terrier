	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness warfarin patient IPF . Approximately 256 patient randomize 1:1 either warfarin placebo . Patients return week 1 safety review every 16 week 48 week . The primary endpoint study time either death , non-bleeding/non-elective hospitalization , drop great 10 % forced vital capacity ( FVC ) baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : ACE-IPF double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial oral warfarin dose adjust international normalized ratio ( INR ) response 2.0 3.0 , compare sham dose-adjusted placebo . The trial originally design event-driven study treatment period 144 week . Given slow rate recruitment high anticipated event rate see another Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Clinical Research Network ( IPFnet ) trial , protocol modify maximum treatment period 48 week eleven patient enrol study . Participants see screen , baseline , 16 , 32 , 48 week enrollment . Outcome measure : The primary outcome composite endpoint base time all-cause mortality ; non-elective , non-bleeding hospitalization ; decrease absolute FVC ≥10 % baseline value . Secondary outcome measure include rate mortality , hospitalization , respiratory-related hospitalization , acute exacerbation , bleeding , cardiovascular event , change time FVC , six-minute walk test distance , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) , plasma fibrin D-dimer level , quality life ( QOL ) assessment . Data Analysis Continuous variable baseline express mean ( standard deviation ) median ( 25th 75th percentile ) . Categorical variable baseline express count percentage . Unadjusted estimate event rate time-to-event variable compute use Kaplan-Meier estimator comparison base log-rank test statistic . The primary hypothesis test use Cox proportional hazard regression model , compare treatment effect primary composite endpoint . Pre-specified covariates model include indicator variable treatment group DLCO measurement baseline assessment . Randomization : Subjects randomly assign study arm 1:1 ratio , use permuted-block design vary block size , receive either warfarin match placebo . Subjects stratify clinical center DLCO threshold 35 % predict . Randomization list generate study data coordinate center ( DCC ) provide phone- web-enabled registration system ( Almac Clinical Services , Inc. ) allow site enroll subject receive study kit keep study team subject blind treatment assignment . INR test monitoring : Study subject provide two strength warfarin tablet ( 1 mg 2.5 mg ) match placebo . Subjects measure INR encrypt meter ( INRatio® , Alere , San Diego , CA ) least weekly . Home monitoring validate plasma INR measurement week 1 16 visit . Individual INR meter test strip replace subject reinstructed meter INR reading vary 30 % laboratory INR . Efficacy home INR measure determine time-in-target INR range patient , calculate basis linear interpolation , 12 exclude reading take baseline , initial warfarin titration ( INR ≥ 2.0 ) , study drug interruption , follow discontinuation study drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis IPF Age 35 80 , inclusive Capable understand sign consent Progression despite conventional therapy ( standard care ) . Progression define : 1 . Worsened dyspnea 2 . FVC decrease &gt; =10 % predict OR 3 . DLCO decrease &gt; =10 % absolute OR 4 . Reduction oxygenation saturation &gt; = 5 % without exertion constant oxygen ( 02 ) administration 5 . Worsened radiographic finding ( chest xray highresolution compute tomography ) Current enrollment another investigational protocol Current treatment investigational drug ( i.e. , participate active investigational drug protocol ) within previous 4 week 5 time halflife investigational agent , whichever longer , prior screen Subject actively list lung transplantation time enrollment Subjects able perform/complete study , judgment physician investigator coordinator , least 3 month . For example : 1 . Subject current sign symptom severe , progressive uncontrolled comorbid illness : renal , hepatic , hematologic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , cardiac , neurologic , cerebral disease , laboratory abnormality would pose/suggest risk subject participation study . 2 . Subject transplant organ require immunosuppression 3 . History substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) within 2 year prior screen , history noncompliance medical regimen , inability unwillingness perform INR monitoring , condition/circumstance could interfere subject 's adherence protocol requirement ( e.g . psychiatric disease , lack motivation , travel , etc ) . 4 . Have know active malignancy history malignancy within previous 2 year ( example exception nonmelanoma skin cancer treat evidence recurrence least 3 month ) might increase risk bleed . Estimated life expectancy &lt; 12 month due nonpulmonary cause . Subject another respiratory disease predominant ( judged PI ) addition IPF . Anticoagulationrelated exclusion include : 1 . Current anticoagulation therapy warfarin 2 . Increased risk bleeding ( e.g . uncorrectable inherited acquire bleed disorder ) 3 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000 hematocrit &lt; 30 % &gt; 55 % 4 . History severe gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 month screen 5 . History cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) within 6 month screen 6 . High risk fall judge PI 7 . Surgery major trauma within past 30 day 8 . Pregnancy , lack use birth control method woman childbearing age 9 . Any condition , determination PI , likely require anticoagulation therapy study . 10 . Clopidogrel aspirin combination therapy &gt; 30 day duration exclusionary . ( Aspirin monotherapy [ 81325 mg daily ] clopidogrel monotherapy acceptable . Combination clopidogrel aspirin &lt; =81mg/day ≤30 day also acceptable . NSAIDS discourage ; acetaminophen may substitute . ) 11 . Patients prasugrel exclude . Prasugrel must stop one week prior start study drug .</criteria>
