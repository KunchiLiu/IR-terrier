	<detailed_description>The aim study improve loco-regional control rate overall survival locally advanced head neck squamous carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . We hypothesize addition nimotuzumab ( recombinant humanize murine immune antibody block epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) transform growth factor ( TGF ) ) current gold standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) , adjuvant setting patient resection locally advanced HNSCC confer therapeutic advantage . We design phase III randomize study include placebo arm . We assume 10 % increase 2 year disease free survival ( 60 % 70 % ) . To achieve statistical significance 90 % power , calculate need 355 patient per arm , assume also 10 % dropout rate . We aim accomplish study involvement multidisciplinary team surgical , radiation medical oncologist actively involved management HNSCC come multiple institution span least 12 different country . For quality assurance involvement Singapore Clinical Research Institute lead data coordination ensure fidelity data collect statistical analysis ; European Society Therapeutic Radiation Oncology ( EQUAL-ESTRO ) radiation dose field international independent panel medical oncologist , radiation oncologist biostatistician Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) . This committee monitor significant event advise continuation termination trial . Concurrent randomize trial , collect bio specimen include blood , tumour saliva , pre-treatment completion surgical resection . We hypothesize important biomarkers include cluster gene , cancer stem cell predict prognosis treatment response . The analysis perform powerful large sample size , specimen collect prospectively statistical analysis multivariate , incorporate treatment biological staging data .</detailed_description>
