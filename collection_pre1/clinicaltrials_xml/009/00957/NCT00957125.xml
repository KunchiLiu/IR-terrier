	<brief_summary>Patients localize primary breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer suitable primary medical treatment and/or regional lymph node metastasis receive six cycle chemotherapy epirubicin docetaxel . Treatment evaluation perform second , fourth sixth cycle . In case SD/PR second course , bevacizumab add combination remain four course . Besides standard response evaluation clinically mammography ultrasound , several functional image technique include MR , CT-PET contrast-enhanced ultrasound investigate . Fresh tumor tissue sample primary tumor collect start , two course connection surgery . The aim trial detect biological factor functional image technique ability predict response early stage treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Translational Trial Molecular Markers Functional Imaging Predict Response Preoperative Treatment Breast Cancer Early</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : Objective response ( OR ) characterize conventional radiological functional imaging procedure biological tumour marker early point treatment epirubicin + docetaxel effect addition bevacizumab reflect procedure . Early functional biological change signal pathological complete response ( pCR ) . Secondary endpoint : Secondary endpoint : Morphological biological change tumour expose cytotoxic target treatment . Disease-free survival . Safety . Evaluations : Before start treatment : Tumour staging : Bone scan , chest X-ray liver ultrasound CT scan chest abdomen within four week start treatment . Physical examination , conventional radiology ( ultrasound mammography include pre-treatment localization carbon suspension ) functional imaging procedure ( MRI PET-CT Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS ) Scintigraphy 99m-Tc-HMPAO ( Ceretec ) ) within two week start treatment . Blood sample ( SNP , metabolomics , M-30 assay , TK/XPA-210 assay , angiogenesis marker , TIMP-1 , tissue factor ) tumour biopsy ( transcriptomics , proteomics , IHC-stroma , AMOT ) collect within two week start treatment . During treatment : Physical examination start treatment . Imaging procedure : Mammography , ultrasound ( compulsory ) one week ( 5-9 day ) cycle 2 , 4 6 . MRI , PET-CT , Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS ) apply accord availability participate site , one week ( 5-9 day ) cycle 2 4 . Tumour marker : Blood sample ( proteomics , metabolomics , M-30 assay , TK/XPA-210 assay , angiogenesis marker , TIMP-1 , tissue factor ) collect 48 hour cycle 1 thru 4 . Tumour tissue ( transcriptomics , proteomics , IHC-stroma , AMOT ) take charge biopsy one week ( 5-9 day ) cycle 2 tumour specimen connection surgery . Totally , 150-200 patient measurable/evaluable primary breast cancer plan inclusion within period two year time . For image method , approximately 40-50 patient include . The study design find early predictor response test set-up several different molecular imaging tool . In addition , method change pattern occur treatment compare baseline finding , case functional imaging , standard imaging procedure . All patient follow five year operation regard outcome toxicity .</detailed_description>
