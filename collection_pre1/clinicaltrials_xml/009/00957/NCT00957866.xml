	<brief_summary>Background : According recent estimate , prevalence Chronic Hepatitis C ( CHC ) Canada three time common First Nations ( FN ) Metis compare non-FN population . Moreover , infect , progression CHC cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma great FN patient due increase prevalence alcohol abuse , obesity diabetes segment population . Research Plan : This research proposal consist three part . The objective Part I document response anti-viral treatment CHC among treatment-naïve FN Metis Caucasian ( hereafter refer non-FN ) patient reside three urban Western Canadian centre ( Winnipeg , Saskatoon Regina ) . Demographic , clinical response treatment data total 160 patient ( 80/group ) collect centre transfer Section Hepatology University Manitoba statistical analysis . In Part II , applicant document compare immune response HCV proteins throughout course therapy FN , Metis non-FN patient . In final part , direct economic cost CHC care FN , Metis non-FN patient ascertained future cost predict . Hypotheses : Part I - The rate sustain virologic response ( SVR ) treatment CHC high FN Metis compare non-FN Metis patient . Part II - The immune response HCV proteins anti-viral therapy CHC enhance FN Metis compare non-FN non-Metis patient . Part III - The direct cost health care utilization delivery CHC similar among FN Metis non-FN non- Metis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives : 1 . To provide detailed information demographic clinical characteristic treatment-naïve FN Metis versus non-FN Non-Metis patient proceed treatment CHC . 2 . To document compare SVR sustain biochemical response ( SBR ) rate , adherence therapy , side effect , dose adjustment discontinuation treatment FN Metis non-FN Non-Metis patient . 3 . To determine whether immunologic feature associate SVR ( increase NK cell activity enhance interferon gamma production CD4 cell response viral antigen ) differ FN Metis non-FN non-Metis patient . 4 . To document compare direct cost health care utilization delivery CHC FN Metis non-FN Non-Metis patient . 5 . Develop model predict outcome therapy , use demographic , clinical viral characteristic , test model race one explanatory variable . 6 . To forecast future prevalence , mortality medical cost CHC care Canada .</detailed_description>
