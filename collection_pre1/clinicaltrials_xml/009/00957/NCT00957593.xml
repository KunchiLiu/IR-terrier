	<brief_title>Induction Labor With Oxytocin : When Should Oxytocin Held ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxytocin common agent use induce augment labor . Oxytocin injection approve Food Drug Administration initiation improvement uterine contraction achieve vaginal delivery . It use induce labor stimulate reinforce labor . The relationship oxytocin receptor crucial obtain adequate uterine activity thus induce active labor . Due balance relationship , question exists optimal regimen oxytocin administration induction labor long continue oxytocin active labor begin . Some literature suggest active phase labor oxytocin may discontinue without alter progression labor . The objective study determine whether increase rate cesarean delivery woman undergo induction labor oxytocin discontinue active phase labor . Blair-Bell first , 1909 , demonstrate uterotonic action posterior pituitary extract cesarean delivery . Since oxytocin , synthesize du Vigneaud et al , commonly use induction labor . Oxytocin ( OT ) polypeptide hormone , synthesize hypothalamus reproductive tissue pregnancy . Oxytocin stimulate uterine contraction mechanism involve activation receptor-operated calcium channel . Calcium-dependent phosphorylation myosin trigger interaction myosin actin subunit throughout uterus lead contraction . During labor parturition relationship oxytocin receptor critical achieve adequate uterine contraction thus active labor . If receptor present , see early gestation , large amount OT require contraction . The opposite true term pregnancy . OT bind receptor important excess dos OT productive may undesirable effect . The use OT cause hyperstimulation ( excessive contraction lead abnormal fetal heart rate pattern ) even use adequate dos . Nonetheless , induction labor OT beneficial reduce incidence prolong labor subsequent cesarean delivery without increase perinatal morbidity mortality . Currently OT protocols vary throughout hospital . Both low high dose regimen outline American College Obstetrician Gynecologists appropriate labor induction . At facility intravenous OT start 1-2 milliunits per minute increase 2 milliunits every 15 minute obtain normal progression labor usually 150-300 Montevideo unit contraction monitor . Low dose regimen less frequent increase dose associate decreased hyperstimulation . However use high-dose oxytocin find increase incidence birth asphyxia perinatal morbidity . As mentioned study proposal , propose experimental arm currently perform patient oxytocin guideline institution . One study Israel find difference pregnancy outcome propose use oxytocin . Although aware one provider stop oxytocin drip patient active labor , commonly perform procedure institution . We aware institution employ . We propose perform prospective randomize control trial compare rate cesarean delivery woman OT discontinue active labor begin ( 5 cm dilation ) compare woman OT continue maintenance level per usual protocol . One study group follow oxytocin protocol incremental 5 cm dilation maintain level throughout labor . The second arm follow oxytocin protocol also incremental , discontinue cervix 5cm . The primary outcome rate cesarean delivery group . Groups stratify parity ( nulliparous vs. multiparous ) . Secondary outcome evaluate include duration labor , fetal heart rate abnormality , frequency uterine hyperstimulation , maternal neonatal outcome . Based sample size calculation , need least 160 patient arm study find increase cesarean delivery rate 25 % 40 % woman undergo induction labor oxytocin discontinue active phase labor begin . This sample size calculation use power 80 % alpha level ( statistical significance ) 0.05 . The baseline rate cesarean US 25-30 % . We choose 40 % significantly increase rate CS since rate would represent 60 % increase CS baseline risk population . We look difference cesarean rate experimental arm maintenance arm . Evaluating data equivalence study ( difference intervention ) would significantly increase sample size need study . With current sample size calculation , cesarean rate difference find group ( mean discontinuation oxytocin inferior maintenance use oxytocin active labor ) , state data support significant increase ( 60 % increase ) risk cesarean delivery rate reduce amount oxytocin use induction labor . It possible blind provider , nurse patient arm study since oxytocin infusion need titrate dose level important manage labor . This intention treat analysis . The decision perform cesarean delivery accord standard obstetric indication ultimately decide treat physician , regardless treatment assignment . Obstetric criterion place perform cesarean delivery . The treat physician time may restart oxytocin patient originally assign oxytocin discontinuation arm .</detailed_description>
