	<brief_title>Study NP002 Subjects With Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease Treat Dyskinesias Due Levodopa Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nicotine employ daily dos lower available OTC smoking-cessation patch , parkinsonian patient experience disable dyskinesia due levodopa treatment . The principal adverse effect dose level nicotine expect nausea acute administration nicotine-naive patient . Because tolerance effect nicotine achieve repeat dose , study design gradually escalate 6 24 mg per day , take 6 separate oral dos 6 mg . The study design see dos tolerate parkinsonian patient also reduce severity frequency dyskinesia experience follow administration levodopa , gold standard medication Parkinson 's disease .</detailed_description>
