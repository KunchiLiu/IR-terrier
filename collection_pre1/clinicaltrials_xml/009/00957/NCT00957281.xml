	<brief_title>The Effect Asthma Systemic Inflammation , Oxidative Stress Cardiovascular Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory airway disorder , associate airflow obstruction bronchial hyper-responsiveness , affect 10 % population Hong Kong . It major respiratory disease Hong Kong carry significant morbidity high hospitalization burden age . The use long-term inhaled corticosteroid treatment recent decade become cornerstone treatment patient persistent asthma reduction mortality . The ultimate goal treatment achieve optimal control airway inflammation asthma-related mortality morbidity . In recent study evaluation airway systemic inflammation patient asthma , various biomarkers measure exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) , like nitric oxide , nitrates/nitrites 8-isoprostane . Similarly , measurement biomarkers blood , notably high-sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , 8-isoprostane antioxidant ( catalase , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione ) , also use reflect level systemic inflammation oxidative stress . There substantial evidence landmark epidemiological study past 10 year , predominantly base plasma hs-CRP , chronic low grade systemic inflammation independent predictor development hypertension , myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death peripheral vascular disease . A dose-dependent risk association hs-CRP cardiovascular morbidity also consistently demonstrate . Moreover , overwhelm data suggest association oxidative stress development cardiovascular disease . This association easily understand light cellular damage endothelial dysfunction due oxidative stress , may lead development atherosclerosis cardiovascular morbidity . In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , chronic inflammatory airway disorder characterize irreversible airflow obstruction induce mainly tobacco smoking , study demonstrate , acute exacerbation COPD smoking , mark imbalance redox status . The increased oxidative stress result inactivation alveolar antiproteases , airspace epithelial damage , increase influx neutrophil lung tissue expression pro-inflammatory mediator . Similarly , patient COPD also increase neutrophil , lymphocytes TNF-Î± peripheral blood . In fact , many study demonstrate existence low grade systemic inflammation oxidative stress patient COPD . Important study publish recent 5 year also link elevation systemic biomarkers , dose-dependent manner , COPD severity increase prevalence cardiovascular cerebrovascular morbidity mortality patient COPD . On hand , chronic airway inflammation also hallmark asthma involve interplay different type inflammatory cell , include T-lymphocytes , eosinophil , neutrophil , macrophage cytokines airway . Although pathogenesis asthma incompletely understood , study show associated state increase free radical formation , cell derive airways peripheral blood patient asthma generate increased amount reactive oxygen specie , level related severity asthma . Besides , airway biomarkers indicate airway inflammation oxidative stress consistently show positively related asthma severity asthma control , alleviate treatment inhaled corticosteroid . Additionally , recent preliminary study indicate , apart presence chronic airway inflammation ( elevate EBC nitric oxide , EBC nitrites/nitrates EBC 8-isoprostane ) , asthma may also associate chronic low grade systemic inflammation ( elevation plasma hs-CRP ) increase oxidative stress ( increased 8-isoprostane ; alter erythrocyte superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase glutathione ) . Whether presence systemic inflammation oxidative stress asthma actually consequence `` overspill '' uncontrolled airway inflammation existence extrapulmonary source inflammation remain unknown . At moment , little evidence correlation airway systemic inflammation asthma , well relation systemic inflammation oxidative stress asthma severity . Intuitively , COPD , asthma-related systemic inflammation may well increase propensity development cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . However , also lack study describes risk cardiovascular outcome asthma-related systemic inflammation oxidative stress . Therefore , conduct current study primary objective investigate association asthma severity systemic inflammation oxidative stress , effect risk various cardiovascular morbidity . The secondary objective correlate airway inflammation oxidative stress systemic inflammation oxidative stress stable asthmatic .</detailed_description>
