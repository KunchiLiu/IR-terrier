	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study motility small intestine colon alter accord subtype irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) patient . IBS currently classify follow subtypes : - Diarrhoea-IBS ( IBS-D ) - Constipation-IBS ( IBS-C ) - Mixed-IBS ( IBS-M ) - Unsubtyped-IBS ( IBS-U ) accord Bristol scale . Magnetic Tracking System ( MTS ) new minimal invasive technic allow motility study whole human gastrointestinal tract . The magnetic cylindrical pill ( 6x15mm ) swallow 9 AM day one . The recording make 4 PM 8 AM 2 PM day two . The patient place bed supply standardize food fluid . The Magnetic Tracking System consist 4 x 4 matrix sensor position respect anatomical reference point . Before measurement , matrix calibrate offset earth 's environmental magnetic field . During experiment , magnet coordinate continuously monitor transmit computer processing storage . Respiratory artifact filter . Digestive movement classify 1 ) non-propulsive 2 ) propulsive transform either trajectory dynamic graph digestive motility . The Magnetic Tracking System advantage radiographic scintigraphic method conduct test without radiation exposure patient . Preliminary study show good concordance transit measure magnet radiographic transit time . The investigator wish use method , MTS , compare motility small intestine colon patient IBS-D IBS-C well compare group MTS do healthy volunteer condition IBS patient .</brief_summary>
