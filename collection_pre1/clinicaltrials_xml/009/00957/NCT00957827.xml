	<detailed_description>Facial laceration commonly encounter problem trauma emergency room patient . Soft tissue trauma face cause significant psychological impact . Wound care need minimize scar particularly important region . There many study evaluate management soft tissue injury general . For example , simple laceration hand benefit antibiotic therapy . The need antibiotic full thickness laceration lip , however , receive little attention . Full thickness laceration lip define wound violate mucosa , underlie muscle skin ( i.e through-and laceration ) . These oral-cutaneous injury constitute unique type injury laceration expose skin underlie soft tissue microbes oral pharynx normally encounter intact oral mucosa . This represent uniquely different flora typically see simple skin laceration . Because contaminate wound , may increase risk infection increase need prophylactic antibiotic . Currently , consensus prophylactic treatment oral-cutaneous wound many physician prescribe oral antibiotic , others utilize topical antibacterial , still others treat local wound care . A review literature find four original article address topic oral antibiotic prophylaxis . Two four original article suffer serious methodological flaw . The first , published 1965 , prospective observational study neither blind , specify type duration antibiotic therapy . Despite flaw , study demonstrate non-significant trend toward benefit antibiotic . Of interest , author note wound old 24 hour treat antibiotic become infected . The second article , publish 1970 Paterson et . prospective randomize trial , though type duration antibiotic treatment intervention arm leave discretion treat clinician . The author combine mucosal oral laceration oral-cutaneous wound . Wound infection deem present 18.5 % patient treated antibiotic versus 4.3 % receive treatment ( RR = 4.32 , 95 % CI = 1.30 14.31 ) . None patient mucosa-only wound develop wound infection ; infection see patient `` through-and-through '' laceration . Despite , author conclude role prophylactic antibiotic questionable prevent local infection . The third article prospective , randomize study pediatric population evaluate intra-oral laceration . In study 4.3 % patient treat prophylactic penicillin evidence wound infection follow-up , versus 8.5 % patient control arm ( RR = 0.51 , 95 % CI = 0.10 2.65 ) . The author conclude give low background rate infection study ( 8.5 % ) , study markedly underpowered , severely limited ability make conclusion regard efficacy prophylactic antibiotic . Finally , 1989 , Steele et al . randomize 62 adult patient present within 24 hour injury single emergency department full-thickness intraoral `` through-and-through '' laceration either treatment oral antibiotic ( penicillin VK 5 day ) placebo therapy . Among patient treat penicillin prophylaxis , 6.7 % develop wound infection versus 18.8 % placebo group ( RR = 0.36 , 95 % CI = 0.08 1.63 ) . In subgroup analysis patient perfectly compliant therapy pill count , infection penicillin arm versus 17.9 % placebo arm ( p = 0.054 use two-tailed Fisher exact test ) . The author alternatively report statistically significant finding , use one-tailed Fisher exact test , yield p value 0.027 . Furthermore , subgroup analysis `` through-and-though '' laceration , 7 % ( 1 14 ) versus 27 % ( 4 15 ) patient develop wound infection treatment placebo group , respectively ( RR = 0.27 , 95 % CI = 0.03 2.12 ) . Overall author conclude conclusively recommend prophylactic penicillin adult intraoral laceration treat within 24 hour injury , though may trend towards benefit 9 . They also suggest patient `` through-and-through '' wound may benefit proportionally prophylaxis . Despite author ' inability make conclusive recommendation available data , many textbook cite reference recommend routine use antibiotic oral-cutaneous wound . Many text book , hand , address topic . Our study aim answer question whether antibiotic reduce wound infection rate through-and-through laceration lip dedicate antibiotic regimen evaluate prospectively . The type antibiotic use prophylactically treat oral-cutaneous wound also remain controversial among clinician . Previous study utilized penicillin V K. Penicillin , however , fully cover flora typically culture infected oral-cutaneous wound . Cephalexin well describe literature appropriate choice oropharyngeal infection appropriate skin flora coverage , thereby , make ideal antibiotic prophylaxis oral-cutaneous wound . Current practice concern use antibiotic oral-cutaneous wound varies greatly . Many textbook either address topic cite inconclusive evidence . A thorough search literature reveal four original article . No article able produce significant result trend recommendation mixed . Currently , consensus regard treatment oral cutaneous wound patient treat oral antibiotic , local wound care depend treat physician 's preference . It important determine best treatment protocol unique wound .</detailed_description>
