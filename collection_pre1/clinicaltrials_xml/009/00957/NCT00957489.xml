	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluate Effectiveness Two Different Appliances Treatment Class II Division 1 Malocclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Dynamax appliance relatively new appliance treatment Class II malocclusion introduce 2003 . The appliance theoretical advantage incremental mandibular advancement without need bite registration , ability operator simultaneously provide functional fixed appliance phase treatment . Furthermore , Dynamax appliance design limit low low incisor proclination upper incisor retroclination without increase lower facial height . There limited research appliance one trial carry . In study effect Dynamax compare Twin-block , unfortunately , trial carry contemporary standard suffer severe shortcoming . For example , non compliance rate account sample size calculation , randomisation sequence clear , investigator carry intention-to-treat analysis , statistical analysis simplistic study carry single dental school set . This raise question efficiency Dynamax appliance whether effective 'real ' world setting . The aim study compare effectiveness Dynamax appliance Twin-block appliance treatment Class II Division 1 malocclusion .</detailed_description>
