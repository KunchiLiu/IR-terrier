	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle loss common consequence age individual reach level compromise health quality life . Age-associated increase cytokine inflammatory signaling may important contributor process . In project investigator test hypotheses 1 ) testosterone inhibit cytokine inflammatory signal skeletal muscle older adult 2 ) augment anabolic response increase skeletal muscle activity . The investigator also assess practical question whether testosterone injection gel application elicit similar response . Resistance exercise use mean stimulating inflammatory anabolic response skeletal muscle . In order ass effect testosterone response , fourteen subject perform resistance exercise two occasion separate 7 day . The first session perform prior initiation testosterone therapy second session perform receive testosterone 7 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In project study acute response testosterone treatment two group seven subject , compare two method administration ( injection vs. topical gel ) sequential fashion order obtain pilot information subsequent , randomize , blind long-term investigation . The first session perform prior initiation testosterone therapy second session perform receive testosterone 7 day . Because dietary intake , particularly protein intake , influence muscle metabolism , subject place standardized diet twenty four hour period precede muscle metabolism study order reduce likelihood skew result due variation nutritional intake prior study . In addition , subject ask maintain food intake diary three day period prior metabolism study order document dietary intake day lead muscle metabolism study . Subjects also ask complete fatigue questionnaire baseline final study ass perceive change fatigue two treatment group treatment period . Subjects also collect urine twenty four hour period prior baseline final study measure cortisol level , influence rate protein breakdown .</detailed_description>

Any man history breast cancer prostate cancer , indication occult carcinoma elevation prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) 4.0 mg/L ( 53 ) , severe benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) history ( frequent urination , reduce stream ) exclude . Subjects liver dysfunction evidence history hepatitis B hepatitis C , threefold elevation liver enzyme ( Alk phos , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) normal screen exclude study . Any subject blood pressure three consecutive measurement take one week interval systolic pressure ³ 140 diastolic blood pressure ³ 90 exclude . Any subject major medical illness diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , sleep apnea exclude . Moreover , subject recent history smoking tobacco . Morbidly obese old men ( BMI &gt; 35 ) also exclude . Subjects evidence kidney disease ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dl ) exclude participation . Any subject thyroid disease determine abnormal thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level exclude participation . Any subject testing positive HIV exclude . Allergy iodine , component Betadine use prepare subject 's skin invasive procedure , cause exclusion study . Men serum total testosterone concentration great 500 ng/dL exclude . Subjects engage high intensity resistance training regular basis exclude . Subjects know coagulation disorder clinical evidence indicative bleeding disorder ( easy bruising , `` free bleeder '' ) enrol study due potential problem could arise muscle biopsy procedure .</criteria>
