	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study give cetuximab and/or IMC-A12 surgery squamous cell carcinoma head neck , order learn study drug may cause change biomarkers . Biomarkers chemical `` marker '' blood and/or tissue may relate reaction study treatment . The safety study treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Treatment With Cetuximab and/or IMC-A12</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Cetuximab IMC-A12 design block protein think cause cancer cell grow . This may help slow growth tumor . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 group . There equal chance assign group . - Group 1 receive cetuximab alone . - Group 2 receive IMC-A12 alone . - Group 3 receive cetuximab IMC-A12 combination . If assign group 2 3 hearing test within 90 day start treatment study drug . Study Treatment : Groups 1 3 : Cetuximab give vein Days 1 8 . The first dose give 2 hour . The second dose give 1 hour . To low risk allergic reaction , Groups 1 3 also receive diphenhydramine mouth vein first dose cetuximab . If study doctor decides need , diphenhydramine may also give second dose cetuximab ( third , applicable ) . Groups 2 3 : IMC-A12 give vein 1 hour Days 1 8 . All Groups : You surgery Day 10 . If reason surgery delayed , study doctor may decide receive third dose assign study drug ( ) Day 15 . In case , cetuximab give 1 hour and/or IMC-A12 give 1 hour , depend group . You sign separate consent form describe surgery risk detail . Study Tests : Within 5 day second dose study drug ( ) , within 5 day third dose ( applicable ) , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You ask side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On day surgery , CT scan MRI head neck . If need , test instead do surgery sometime last dose study drug ( ) . On day surgery , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test vital sign measure . If need , test instead do 2 day surgery . Length Study Drug Dosing : After last dose study drug ( ) , Day 8 Day 15 , participation study treatment period . You take study drug ( ) early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-Up : If return clinic within 30 day surgery , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask side effect may occur . Otherwise visit schedule time , study staff call phone instead . You ask . If experiencing side effect study drug ( ) time follow-up visit call , may additional follow-up doctor decide need . The follow-up test , procedure , schedule doctor 's decision depend side effect . You repeat hear test within 90 day surgery receive least 1 dose IMC-A12 . Long-Term Follow-Up : On long-time basis surgery , study staff may review medical record collect information health . During time , family member may contact ask confirm provide information health . The contact may occur clinic visit phone , mail , e-mail . This investigational study . Cetuximab commercially available FDA approve treat squamous cell carcinoma spread come back , patient respond platinum-based therapy . Using cetuximab combination surgery investigational . IMC-A12 FDA approve commercially available . At time , IMC-A12 use research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( exclude carcinoma nasopharynx type II III accord World Health Organization criterion ) , surgical resection tumor plan part treatment . Patients skin squamous cell carcinoma head neck region also include study . 2 . There availability baseline , paraffinembedded , tumor specimen biomarker evaluation . No antineoplastic treatment allow time obtain baseline tumor specimen randomization . If baseline tumor specimen available , biopsy tumor perform prior randomization . 3 . Prior treatment biological agent target epidermal growth factor receptor allow , provide time last exposure treatment &gt; /= 6 month . 4 . The patient fast serum glucose &lt; 130 mg/dL HbA1C &lt; 7.0 % . Patients history diabetes mellitus allow participate , provide stable dietary therapeutic regimen condition . 5 . The patient adequate renal function , define serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 * institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , creatinine clearance &gt; /=60 mL/min patient creatinine level ULN . 6 . Because teratogenicity cetuximab IMCA12 know , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . 7 . The patient age &gt; /= 18 year . 8 . The patient patient 's legally authorize representative ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 9 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 1 . Patients receive agent ( investigational ) potential antineoplastic activity within 3 week prior obtain baseline tumor specimen biomarker evaluation . 2 . Patients receive concomitant radiation . 3 . Prior treatment agent target insulinlike growth factor1 receptor . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound chemical biological composition similar cetuximab IMCA12 . 5 . Pregnant patient , patient breast feeding ( patient positive pregnancy test within first 30 day first dose treatment exclude ) . 6 . Patients uncontrolled illness , opinion investigator , could aggravate administration study drug ( ) .</criteria>
