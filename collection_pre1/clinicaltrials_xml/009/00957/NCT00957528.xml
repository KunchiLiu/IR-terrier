	<detailed_description>Men woman undergo progressive reduction lean muscle mass ( sarcopenia ) advance age regardless level physical activity . A 12-yr longitudinal study healthy sedentary old men show correlation loss muscle cross-sectional area muscle strength thigh , quadriceps , flexor muscle . Once weaken , old individual prone fall prevent independent living diminish quality life . There need develop therapy counteract loss skeletal muscle strength age . Studies show exercise testosterone administration increase skeletal muscle mass strength old men . However , increase muscle strength testosterone old men consistent study . Androgens increase muscle mass either increase muscle protein synthesis inhibit muscle protein breakdown . This proposal investigate hypothesis cyclic testosterone administration ( monthly on/off cycle ) preferentially increase muscle protein synthesis result consistent great improvement muscle strength continuous testosterone administration .</detailed_description>
