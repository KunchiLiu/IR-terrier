	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether radiation therapy give together cisplatin effective without cetuximab treat patient cervical cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give radiation therapy together cisplatin see well work compare radiation therapy cisplatin give together cetuximab treat patient stage IB , stage II , stage IIIB cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With Without Cetuximab Treating Patients With Stage IB , Stage II , Stage IIIB Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate efficacy treatment cetuximab standard radiochemotherapy regimen ( pelvic radiotherapy cisplatin ) patient stage IB2 , II , IIIB cervical cancer evaluate number patient without recurrence 2 year . Secondary - Analyze tumor response MRI external radiotherapy . - Assess tolerance cetuximab standard radiochemotherapy patient previously treat generally good condition . - Study correlation treatment response analysis EGFR mutation ( exon 18-21 tyrosine kinase domain include two hot spot L858R E746-A750 ) . - Study correlation treatment response evaluation number copy EGFR gene . - Study correlation treatment response analysis mutation codon 12 13 KRAS2 direct sequencing . - Study correlation treatment response research DNA sequence human papillomavirus . - Study correlation treatment response overexpression EGFR COX2 ( centralize ) IHC . - Study correlation treatment response characterization genomic signature ( genome , transcriptome , Affymetrix chip sample freeze liquid nitrogen ) . - Collect tumor sample molecular analysis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan surgery ( yes v ) randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour weekly week 1-6 . Patients also undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 day week week 2-5 2-6 . - Arm II : Patients receive cisplatin undergo radiotherapy arm I . Patients also receive cetuximab IV 1 hour weekly week 1-6 . After 6-8 week study treatment , patient continue treatment recommend center ( i.e. , utero-vaginal brachytherapy , additional radiotherapy , surgery ) . Tumor tissue blood sample collect analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-4 week every 4 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
