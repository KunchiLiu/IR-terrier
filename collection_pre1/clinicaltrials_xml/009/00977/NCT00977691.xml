	<brief_summary>Background : - Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , involve transplant donor marrow stem cell , capable cure congenital anemia . BMT usually involve high-intensity treatment chemotherapy radiation kill abnormal cell , affect system body . - People anemia often damage organ kidney , damage chemotherapy . Only approximately 20 percent patient full-matched donor , make treatment many people anemias unavailable . However , 90 percent patient may half-matched donor , use half-matched donor increase toxicity BMT . Objectives : - To determine research BMT half-matched donor cell , low-intensity radiation , immunosuppressant drug , chemotherapy effective patient sickle cell disease Beta-thalassemia . - To determine effectiveness cyclophosphamide , immunosuppressant drug , prevent rejection donor cell . Eligibility : - Recipients individual least 18 year age diagnose sickle cell disease Beta-thalassemia , family member haploidentical ( i.e. , half match ) tissue match . - Donors healthy individual age 2 80 find suitable donor . Design : - Donors undergo apheresis , involve withdraw blood one arm vein , pass machine remove bone marrow stem cell , return remain blood vein arm . Donors receive drug cause stem cell release bloodstream prior apheresis procedure . - Recipients undergo routine physical laboratory examination , include bone marrow sample begin study . After transplantation , physical laboratory examination occur weekly twice weekly basis outpatient clinic . Recipients examine every 6 month start 100 day posttransplant 5 year . - Recipients receive low-dose radiation two treatment 1 2 day transplant . They also give immunosuppressant therapy alemtuzumab sirolimus . Another immunosuppressant drug , cyclophosphamide , give future need subset recipient prevent rejection donor cell . - Recipients receive donor stem cell previously insert central line . The process take 8 hour . - Recipients receive blood transfusion necessary prevent anemia bleed posttransplant period . They may also receive intravenous antibiotic prevent infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nonmyeloablative Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Mobilized Hematopoietic Precursor Cell Transplantation Severe Congenital Anemias Including Sickle Cell Disease Beta-Thalassemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplant currently investigate phase I/II trial assess engraftment , efficacy , toxicity number transplant center . Our ongoing protocol patient severe congenital anemia , particularly sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , HLA-matched sibling donor excellent preliminary result . None patient engraft sickle-related event evidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . There significant toxicity associate condition regimen . Our main limitation lack HLA-matched sibling donor majority patient . We perform study patient severe SCD lack suitable donor underwent search match unrelated donor umbilical cord donor . The vast majority patient find appropriate alternative donor . We therefore seek develop safe nonmyeloablative regimen apply haploidentical set family member serve donor greatly expand donor pool . In protocol , propose PBSC transplantation patient SCD thalassemia , consider high risk complication ineligible standard bone marrow transplantation , allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell haploidentical donor use novel immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation attempt decrease transplant-related morbidity/mortality . The low intensity nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consist relatively low radiation dose therapeutic radiation , Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) , Sirolimus ( Rapamune ) , Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) strategy provide adequate immunosuppression allow sufficient engraftment clinical remission low risk GVHD development . T-cell replete , donor-derived , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized PBSC use establish hematopoietic lymphoid reconstitution . The primary endpoint study percentage patient sustain donor type hemoglobin without significant GVHD patient SCD , transfusion-independent without significant GVHD patient thalassemia . Other endpoint include degree donor-host chimerism necessary long term graft survival disease amelioration , incidence acute chronic GVHD , incidence graft rejection , transplant-related morbidity , well disease-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
