	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria , disease transmit mosquito , affect million people high frequency , morbidity , mortality infant young child . Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium vivax , common severe form malaria , host- stage-specific protein induce immunity disease . - Vaccines stage infect mosquito prevent spread malaria . Researchers develop vaccine compose single protein , Pfs25 , induce antibody human host ingest mosquito prevent malaria parasite reproduce stop transmission disease . Because Pfs25 present mosquito , human develop antibody antigen even endemic area . Repeated injection vaccine may necessary . Objectives : - To establish safety optimal dosage malaria vaccine develop Pfs25 protein . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 49 year age never malaria receive malaria vaccine . Design : - Two dos Pfs25 conjugate ( 10 microgram 25 microgram ) evaluate study . Participants receive one dose order provide best scientific data evaluation . - To determine eligibility , participant provide medical history physical examination , provide blood urine sample test HIV/AIDS , hepatitis , condition would prevent participate . - Eligible participant receive one injection vaccine . The injection follow 30 minute later temperature read inspection vaccine site . - Upon leave clinic , participant receive diary form , digital thermometer , ruler , instruction take temperature measure redness swell ( ) injection site . About 6 hour later , daily 3 day , participant take temperature home examine injection site . Participants examine clinic 48 72 hour day 7 injection . A blood sample take 1 week immunization . - Participants receive second third injection vaccine 6-week interval , follow record procedure give . Further blood sample take regular interval 12 month vaccination , direct study researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Safety Immunogenicity Malaria Transmission-blocking Pfs25-Pfs25 Conjugate Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria disease affect million people Africa , Asia , Central South America . It high frequency , morbidity , mortality infant young child . For many reason , vaccine would prevent disease seek . Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium vivax , common severe form malaria , host stage specific proteins induce immunity disease cause pathogen . Surprisingly , vaccine stage infect mosquitos prevent spread malaria ( transmission-blocking ) . We develop vaccine compose single protein , denote Pfs25 , induce transmission-blocking antibody human host . These transmission-blocking antibody ingest mosquito inactivate sexual form plasmodia ( ookinetes ) develop midgut mosquito . Because Pfs25 present mosquito , human develop antibody antigen even endemic area . No antibody detect Pfs25 , 21-kD protein express zygote ookinetes P. falciparum know sensitive target transmission-blocking antibody . Theoretically , frequent boost antigen , require experimental malarial vaccine , would necessary . Our investigational vaccine base upon follow : 1 . Pfs25 low molecular weight protein poor immunogen . Bharti et al show protective action antibody Pvs25 raise intensive immunization rabbit mouse ( regime suitable human ) recombinant protein . These finding confirm ; 2 . Transmission Plasmodia mosquito mediate ingestion gametocyte human bloodstream . Within 10 minute , gametocyte transform gamete midgut mosquito . The male gametocyte fertilize female form zygote . Twenty four hour later ookinetes pierce epithelium midgut differentiate oocyst . This cell type form sporozoite lodge salivary gland infective form inject mosquito human host . Pfs25 may also involve survival ookinete midgut transformation oocyst ; 3 . The immunogenicity poor immunogen increase , especially infant , covalently bind medically-acceptable carrier protein form conjugate . The Pfs25 bound synthetic scheme use Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide protein . The resultant conjugate immunogenic , unexpectedly , antibody elicit vaccine continue rise 3 month 7 month second third injection . The property Pfs25 conjugate elicit long-lived antibody high level unique construct . Our data Pfs25 conjugate mouse suggest administration vaccine whole population include infant along routine immunization may sufficient elicit long-lived , effective transmission-blocking activity . Our plan evaluate clinical lot conjugate P. falciparum P. vivax , safety immunogenicity adult , child infant , establish clinical site test efficacy .</detailed_description>
