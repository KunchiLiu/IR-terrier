	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , lead cause cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) liver transplantation , affect approximately 170 million individual worldwide . The prevention HCV transmission early intervention HCV infection urgently need reduce halt liver-related morbidity mortality . Currently , combination therapy peginterferon ( Peg-IFN ) ribavirin ( RBV ) become standard care chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient , overall sustain virologic response ( SVR ) rate 54-63 % . Treatment weekly Peg-IFN weight-based RBV 48 week result significantly high SVR rate 24 week patient HCV genotype 1 infection . While HCV genotype 1 patient rapid virologic response ( RVR ) low pretreatment viral load could receive short duration therapy without compromise treatment response , either high baseline viral load fail achieve RVR receive least 48 week treatment . RVR consider important factor SVR . Furthermore , several study repeat show high baseline viral load ( &gt; 400,000~800,000 IU/mL ) closely associated failure achieve RVR patient . Therefore , effort improve RVR rate important facilitate overall treatment response . Double filtration plasmapheresis ( DFPP ) , well establish method therapeutic apheresis , widespread use clinical practice several indication plasma filter optimize respective elimination target . By way plasma separator , blood separate plasma cell component . Separated plasma lead plasma component separator pore plasma component separator fractionate plasma large small molecular component . The large molecular component , include pathogenic substance , remove discard small molecular component , include protein albumin gamma-globulin , return patient mixed cell component . DFPP use treatment many disease neurological disease , collagen disease , hematological disease , skin disease , renal disease , efficacy safety well establish . It noteworthy mention DFPP indicate treat CHC Japan since April 2008 . In Germany , safety DFPP LDL-apheresis analyze within retrospective multicenter investigation include data 1702 ambulatory DFPP-LDL-apheresis treatment 52 patient ( REMUKAST Study ) . Ninety-eight percent treatment bear serious adverse event 2 % slight hypotensive episode observe . In recent investigation , efficacy safety DFPP compare HELP ( Heparin-induced Extracorporeal LDL-Cholesterol Precipitation ) system cross-over design . No serious adverse event occur study include 44 treatment . During chronic infection , level serum HCV RNA steady state minor fluctuation untreated patient . A dynamic equilibrium , involve hepatocytes plasma component , exist new viral production viral destruction chronic HCV infection . After initiation Peg-IFN plus RBV therapy , viral decline divide two major phase . Over first 24 - 48 h initial dose PEG-IFN/RBV lead first decline HCV RNA range 0.5-2.0 log level . This rapid first phase relate significant reduction virus production degradation free virus particle , follow second much slow one reflect elimination clearance infect cell . As described , high baseline viral load ( HCV-RNA &gt; 800,000 IU/mL ) initiation therapy consider negative predictor SVR HCV genotype 1 patient . Reduction baseline viral load mean therapeutic DFPP may represent plausible adjunct improve antiviral therapy reduce virus load initiation treatment synergy Peg-IFN RBV combination therapy . Therefore rationale effect DFPP reduce amount virus initiation phase support therapeutic efficacy Peg-IFN RBV combination therapy prevent liver reinfection circulate HCV . Recently , several small-scaled clinical study evaluate therapeutic efficacy safety DFPP conjunction IFN-based therapy conduct treatment-naïve genotyp1 high viral load CHC patient , CHC patient underwent liver transplantation . These study show patient DFPP treatment favorable HCV early viral kinetics without DFPP treatment . The large-scaled non-randomized clinical study totally evaluate 104 CHC patient show addition DFPP high SVR rate without DFPP treatment HCV genotype 1 patient baseline viral load &gt; 100,000 IU/mL ( 70.8 % versus 50.0 % ) , probably due eliminate substantial part viral particle dynamic equilibrium liver plasma compartment . Furthermore , study show excellent safety DFPP treatment . However , study limit small case number non-randomized assignment , make role DFPP improve efficacy difficult-to-treat HCV patient still debate . Therefore , investigator aim conduct large-scaled randomize control trial evaluate overall response DFPP HCV genotype 1 patient high viral load .</detailed_description>
