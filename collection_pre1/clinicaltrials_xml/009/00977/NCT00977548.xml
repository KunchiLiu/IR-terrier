	<detailed_description>Screening Period : Informed consent , physical examination , medical history report , blood test , pregnancy test ( applicable ) , list current medication , description symptom , chest x-ray , ECG , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy within 4 week study start . Weeks 2,6,10 14 : Blood test . Weeks 4 12 : Blood test , physical exam , patient answer question feeling change medication take . Weeks 8 16 : Blood test , physical exam , patient answer question feeling change medication take , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy ( physician determine patient clinical response partial response treatment . After week 16 ( respond treatment ) : Have bone marrow aspirate/biopsy ( repeated time relapse , i.e. , 50 % increase percentage myeloblast [ leukemia cell ] drop blood count improve require regular blood transfusion require least 8 week , 1 year study ) . After patient stop take erlotinib : Periodic follow-up patient ' status .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must establish diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) either : Low intermediate 1 risk disease International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) MDS symptomatic anemia ( define hemoglobin less 10.0 g/dl ) transfusion dependent anemia ( define require ≥ 4 unit red blood cell ( RBCs ) administer pretreatment hemoglobin value ≤ 9 g/dL 8 week prior Day 1 treatment study ) . Patients anemia must response least 6 week trial erythroid stimulate agent ( ESA ) [ erythropoietin/ darbepoetin ] . Patients serum erythropoietin level 500 mU/ ml diagnosis eligible study without erythropoietin/darbepoetin prior treatment . Patients meet anemia criterion still eligible thrombocytopenia two platelet count &lt; 50 x 10^9/L significant clinical hemorrhage require platelet transfusion neutropenia absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1 x 10^9/L ; Intermediate2 high risk MDS IPSS . Patients ≥ 60 year Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) WHO classification myeloblast percentage 2030 % ( RAEBt MDS FrenchAmericanBritish ( FAB ) classification ) eligible study deem suitable induction chemotherapy decline option . All prior treatment must discontinue 28 day prior Day 1 treatment study except ( ESA ) colony stimulate factor stop 14 day prior start therapy study , hydroxyurea stop 2 day . Prior bone marrow stem cell transplant allow . Secondary therapy relate MDS patient eligible . Patients chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) eligible . Patients must performance status 0 2 Zubrod performance status criterion . Pretreatment pathology material must available morphologic review . Collection blood marrow specimens pathology review must complete within 28 day prior registration . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree least 2 year . In calculate day test measurement , day test measurement do consider Day 0 . Therefore , test do Monday , Monday four week later would consider Day 28 . This allow efficient patient schedule without exceed guideline . If Day 28 60 fall weekend holiday , limit may extend next working day . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Patients must receive prior remission induction chemotherapy treatment MDS . Patients must pregnant nurse potential risk drug use study . Women/men reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Patients know HIV positive eligible study .</criteria>
