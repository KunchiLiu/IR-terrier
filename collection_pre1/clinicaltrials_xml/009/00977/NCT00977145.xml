	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Biological Effects Intratumoral Interferon Gamma Peptide-Based Vaccine Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanoma vaccine associate major regression small percentage patient advance measurable disease . This provide proof-of-principle potential clinical benefit melanoma vaccine however , current response rate low . Thus , critical need additional new therapy melanoma , adjuvant therapy high-risk resect melanoma therapy patient candidate , fail , therapy set advanced disease . It generally agree one mechanism improve immunologic outcome vaccine therapy optimize T cell traffic tumor site . CXCR3 chemokine receptor T cell direct site inflammation follow chemokine gradient . The ligand CXCR3 ( CXCL9 ( MIG ) , CXCL10 ( IP-10 ) CXCL11 ( I-TAC ) ) know induced interferon gamma . This protocol propose administer peptide vaccine activate tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell express CXCR3 , follow intratumoral interferon gamma increase CXCR3 ligands ( CXCL9-11 ) tumor site recruit CXCR3+ T cell . The primary goal propose work ass safety combination peptide vaccine intratumoral interferon gamma ass immunologic outcome tumor site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants stage IIIB , IIIC IV melanoma . Staging must confirm cytological histological examination . Staging cutaneous melanoma base revise AJCC stag system . 2 . Patients must adequate cutaneous subcutaneous metastasis melanoma readily accessible biopsy provide minimum 0.3 cm3 tissue per biopsy ( approximately 0.85 cm 0.85 cm x 0.85 cm five 2mm core biopsy ) time point . Additionally , least one subcutaneous cutaneous metastasis must accessible intratumoral IFNgamma administration . Several scenario may fulfill tumor burden requirement . For example , patient may one large lesion core biopsy take first second biopsy time point entire lesion excise final tissue sample . Alternatively , patient may three lesion , ≥0.3 cm3 , lesion would excise sequentially biopsies 1 , 2 3 . Other combination acceptable . The intent limit study patient cutaneous subcutaneous melanoma metastasis rather lymph node metastasis . There may case subcutaneous nodule definitively characterize nonnodal metastasis start trial patient may include . 3 . Participants ocular , mucosal unknown primary participant multiple primary eligible . 4 . Participants brain metastasis may eligible select circumstance : Patients less equal 3 metastasis may eligible long follow 3 criterion true : The brain metastases completely remove surgery treat completely stereotactic radiotherapy . Stereotactic radiotherapy , gamma knife , use 1 week prior study entry . There evident growth brain metastasis since treatment . No metastasis great 2 cm time protocol entry Patients great 3 metastasis may eligible 3 criterion meet least one year elapse since last treatment . 5 . All participant must : ECOG performance status 0 1 Ability willingness give inform consent 6 . Laboratory parameters The following laboratory parameter require participant . If lab value appear error result transient treatable condition , investigator use his/her clinical judgment decide test may repeat . The requirement inclusion follow : HLAA1 , A2 , A3 , A11+ ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL HGBA1C &lt; 7 % Hepatic : AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Renal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serology ( within 6 month study entry ) HIV negative Hepatitis C negative LDH 2 x ULN 7 . Age 18 year old time trial entry 8 . Participants must least one intact ( undissected ) axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basin 1 . Patients brain metastasis unless meet criterion outline inclusion criterion . 2 . Patients currently receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation , experimental therapy , receive therapy within precede 4 week . Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery may administer within prior 4 week , must administer less one week prior study enrollment . Patients currently receive nitrosoureas receive therapy within precede 6 week . 3 . Patients eligible clinically detectable melanoma deem likely investigator require intervention first 3 month study would require premature discontinuation . Examples circumstance may include untreated bone metastasis risk fracture , rapidly progressive low volume disease . 4 . Patients know suspected allergy component vaccine . 5 . Patients receive follow medication study entry within precede 4 week exclude : Agents putative immunomodulating activity ( exception nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent topical steroid ) Allergy desensitization injection . Systemic corticosteroid , administer parenterally orally . Inhaled steroid ( e.g . Advair® , Flovent® , Azmacort® ) permit . Topical corticosteroid acceptable , include steroid low solubility administer nasally local effect ( e.g . Nasonex® ) . Any growth factor ( e.g . GMCSF , GCSF , erythropoietin ) . Interferon therapy Interleukin2 interleukins . 6 . Prior melanoma vaccination may exclusion criterion circumstance : Patients recur progressed either administration melanoma vaccine may eligible enroll 12 week follow last vaccination . Patients may vaccinate previously peptide vaccine ( include MELITAC 12.1 similar vaccine ) nonpeptide vaccine . 7 . Other investigational drug investigational therapy patient currently take drugs/therapy , receive drugs/therapy within 1 month . 8 . Pregnancy possibility become pregnant vaccine administration . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urinary serum betaHCG ) prior administration first vaccine dose . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . Women must also breast feeding . This consistent existing standard practice vaccine chemotherapy protocol . 9 . Patients medical contraindication potential problem complying requirement protocol , opinion investigator . 10 . Patients classify accord New York Heart Association classification Class III IV heart disease . 11 . Patients body weight &lt; 110 lbs amount frequency blood drawn 12 . Participants must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Participants active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . The following exclusionary : The presence laboratory evidence autoimmune disease ( e.g . positive ANA titer ) without symptom Clinical evidence vitiligo Other form depigmenting illness Mild arthritis require NSAID medication</criteria>
