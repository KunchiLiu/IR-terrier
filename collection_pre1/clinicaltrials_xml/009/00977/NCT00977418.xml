	<brief_summary>Seniors 65 year age old represent one fast grow segment society population double within next 25 year dramatic rate mental decline , cost society billion dollar year . The propose research seek discover whether relatively short term mental physical training enhance gist reasoning , generalize untrained cognitive area modify/strengthen brain function area susceptible age process . To identify neuroprotective non-pharmacological intervention prevent mental decline maximize cognitive brain health course adult lifespan major public policy implication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Cognitive Changes After Reasoning Physical Training Cognitively Normal Seniors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A significant potential exists modify structure function age human brain give intensive mental stimulation physical activity . Age-related cognitive decline consistently identify frontal lobe measure executive control reason . Concomitantly , great vulnerability frontal brain network , subserve executive control function , also identify age . Preliminary evidence highlight potential reason training well physical training modify strengthen brain cognitive function senior . Evidence lab indicate frontally mediate , gist-based reasoning ( defined ability combine detail information construct abstract meaning ) offer promise cognitive domain train . Extracting gist mean massive amount incoming information one vital mental skill healthy mind achieves . Purpose : This proposal innovative study obtain data regard benefit ( ) novel gist-based reason training program ( b ) physical train frontal-lobe mediate cognitive measure executive control cognitively normal senior . The project also employ newly develop ( ) brain measure chart change brain blood flow connectivity combine ( b ) cognitive activation task specifically design measure brain region engage gist reason versus detail processing . The project also examine short dose effect , i.e . 6 week 12 week , previously examine well individual difference base high low performer gist physical training . Methods : 60 cognitively normal senior age 60 75 year recruit study randomize 1 3 group . Each group consist 20 participant : reasoning-trained , physical-trained wait-listed control group . Participants comprehensively screen insure cognitively normal . Prior intervention , participant ' baseline gist detail processing ability , battery cognitive function fitness measure obtain . Structural functional brain measure also obtain . Participants undergo 12 week gist-based train physical training measurement midpoint , 6 week training , endpoint 12 week train 4 week training complete . Training effect measure behaviorally train area ( reason &amp; physical ) untrained cognitive area . Additionally , structural functional brain imaging measure change cerebral blood flow , global regional brain volume , white matter tract , efficiency , activation pattern , blood oxygenation particular focus change frontal region . Significance : The current study seek discover neuroprotective , nonpharmacological intervention could prevent mental decline strengthen cognitive brain health senior , possible societal saving billion dollar . This one first train study explore short-term intensive reason physical training , document pivotal cognitive brain health potential strengthen frontal region loss associate age .</detailed_description>
