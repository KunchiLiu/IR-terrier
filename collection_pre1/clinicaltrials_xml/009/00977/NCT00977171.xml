	<brief_summary>A subset patient suffer chronic fatigue syndrome exhibit symptom neurally mediate hypotension . While underlie pathophysiology chronic fatigue syndrome precisely understood , dysfunction autonomic nervous system think play role subset patient . In several small study , subject within subset note improvement chronic fatigue symptom treat neurally mediate hypotension . As droxidopa act autonomic nervous system show ameliorate symptom neurally mediate hypotension , hypothesize droxidopa could aid treatment chronic fatigue symptom . Neurally mediated hypotension associate patient suffer chronic fatigue syndrome . Droxidopa meanwhile approve Japan treatment symptom neurogenic orthostatic hypotension . As , hypothesize regulate autonomic nervous system patient Chronic fatigue syndrome may prove clinically beneficial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study To Assess The Clinical Benefit Of Droxidopa In Subjects With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-center , open-label study evaluate efficacy safety droxidopa subject chronic fatigue syndrome . The study enroll enough subject allow 10 place 12 week open label treatment period . The study consist initial screening period ( 7 day ) confirm eligibility follow 2 week dose titration period , 12 week treatment period 30 day follow period account new on-going AEs . During screen visit follow assessment record : - Demography ; - Medical history ; - Physical examination ; - ECG ; - Vital sign ( BP , HR , weight ) - Stand Test ( measurement BP heart rate supine position ( head torso elevate approximately 30° horizontal ) 10 , 5 , immediately 1 , 5 10 minute stand ) ; - Tilt Table Test - Blood sample hematology biochemistry ; - Urine sample urinalysis - Pregnancy test females child bear potential . - Concomitant medication review Subjects take ephedrine midodrine stop take drug least 7 day baseline assessment . Within 7 day successful screening , follow baseline assessment record : - Inclusion/Exclusion review ; - Standing test ( measurement BP heart rate 10 , 5 , immediately 1 , 5 10 minute stand ) ; - Vital sign ( BP , HR , weight ) ; - Urine/serum pregnancy test WOCP ; - Concomitant medication ; - Adverse event - Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) ; - Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) ; - Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGI-S ) ; - Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ; - Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI-I ) . Following successful completion screen baseline procedure , subject enter dose titration period . Subjects titrate upwards 100 mg TID , preferably consecutive day definitely within 14 day entry , one follow 3 criterion cease dose escalation meet : 1 . The subject sustain SBP great 140 mmHg DBP great 90 mmHg 1 , 5 10 minute stand , OR sustain SBP great 150 mmHg DBP great 100 mmHg measure supine position ( head torso elevate approximately 30° horizontal ) . 2 . The subject unable tolerate side effect believe related study medication ; 3 . The subject reach maximum dose 600 mg TID droxidopa . If subject meet criteria 1 proceed directly treatment period previous low dose . Subjects meet criterion 2 also proceed directly treatment period previous low dose . Subjects meet criterion 3 enter immediately treatment period 600 mg TID . Subjects meet criterion 1 2 initial 100 mg TID dose consider baseline failure . During treatment , investigator determine whether modify subject 's dose . This determination base subject 's tolerability droxidopa . Upon successful completion dose titration , subject begin 12 week treatment period . Subjects return clinic every 4 week ( +/- 3 day ) efficacy , safety compliance check . A follow-up call occur 30 day completion removal trial record new on-going AEs . droxidopa droxidopa [ also , know L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine , L-threo-DOPS , L-DOPS ] International non-proprietary name ( INN ) synthetic amino acid precursor norepinephrine ( NE ) , originally develop Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. , Limited , Japan . It approve use Japan since 1989 . Droxidopa show improve symptom orthostatic hypotension result variety condition include Shy Drager syndrome ( Multiple System Atrophy ) , Pure Autonomic Failure , Parkinson 's disease . There four stereoisomers DOPS ; however , L-threo-enantiomer ( droxidopa ) biologically active . The exact mechanism action droxidopa treatment symptomatic NOH precisely define ; however , NE replenish property concomitant recovery decrease noradrenergic activity consider major importance . Droxidopa market Japan since 1989 . Data clinical study post-marketing surveillance program conduct Japan show commonly report adverse drug reaction droxidopa increase blood pressure , nausea , headache . In clinical study , prevalence severity droxidopa adverse effect appear similar report placebo control arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SUBJECT SELECTION CRITERIA : Female male outpatient 1865 year age ; Subjects must diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome ( Per Fukuda Criteria ) ; Subjects must neurally mediate hypotension ( NMH ) neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( NOH ) ( confirm via Tilt table test ) ; Voluntarily read sign inform consent . MAIN SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Taking direct act vasoconstricting agent ( i.e . ephedrine midodrine ) Patients take vasoconstrictor agent ephedrine , midodrine must stop take drug least 2 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior baseline visit ( Visit 2 ) ; Taking antihypertensive medication treatment high blood pressure Women childbearing potential use medically accept contraception ; Subject Restrictions : Reproductive potential : Female subject either postmenopausal ( amenorrhea least 12 consecutive month ) , surgically sterile , woman childbearing potential ( WOCP ) use agree use acceptable method contraception throughout study period 4 week last dose investigational product . Acceptable contraceptive include intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , hormonal contraceptive ( oral , depot , patch injectable ) double barrier method condom diaphragms spermicidal gel foam . If hormonal contraceptive use take accord package insert .

For WOCP urine pregnancy test must conduct screening , baseline study termination ; result must negative screening baseline . Any positive result confirm serum beta HCG pregnancy test . Sexually active male whose partner WOCP must agree use condom duration study 4 week last dose ; Women pregnant , breast feeding , plan become pregnant course study ; Have history close angle glaucoma ; Have uncontrolled supine hypertension , define systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg use ≥2 antihypertensive medication ; Have atrial fibrillation , investigator 's opinion , significant cardiac arrhythmia ; Current melancholic major depressive disorder , previous diagnosis psychosis , eat disorder , bipolar disorder .
