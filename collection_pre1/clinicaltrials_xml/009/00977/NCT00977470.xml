	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn add hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) erlotinib help treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Another goal research study learn NSCLC may respond study treatment . Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) type drug call tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . TKIs block protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR may control tumor growth tumor cell survival . However , although TKI drug work lung cancer patient period time , eventually tumor find way resist counteract TKI treatment begin grow . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) drug approve FDA treat malaria , rheumatoid arthritis , several disease . Laboratory research suggest HCQ give TKI , may help delay prevent TKI resistance developing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib With Without Hydroxychloroquine Chemo-Naive Advanced NSCLC ( EGFR ) Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because one know study option best , participant randomize study group : Group A ( erlotinib ) Group B ( erlotinib HCQ ) . Study treatment divide time period call cycle . Each study treatment cycle 28 day . - Erlotinib ( Group A Group B ) take orally day . Hydroxychloroquine ( Group B ) take orally day take erlotinib . - The following test procedure perform day 1 cycle : physical examination , performance status assessment , question symptom side effect , blood routine test . The following procedure perform certain study visit : Research blood test ( cycle 1 , cycle 2 , every even cycle ) ; eye exam ( cycle 4 , cycle 7 , every 3 month ) ; assessment tumor CT MRI scan ( do end even cycle .</detailed_description>
