	<brief_title>IMPAACT P1058A : Pharmacokinetic Effects New Antiretroviral Drugs Children , Adolescents Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication regimens child , adolescent young adult often prescribe base drug resistance previous treatment history . In order find effective regimen , clinician must often turn new drug fully test adolescent pediatric clinical trial . One first step test drug assess drug pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , interaction drug body . This study , follow-on protocol International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( IMPAACT ) P1058 study , test child , adolescent young adult already prescribe treatment regimens new drug . The study examine PK medication combination feature raltegravir , new drug new ARV class entry inhibitor ( EIs ) ; maraviroc , new drug new class fusion inhibitor ( FIs ) ; etravirine , new drug class non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) . Older medication may also use complete regimen . Participation study last 1 7 week involve least two clinic visit . The first screening entry visit medical history take physical exam blood test complete . The second visit measure PK medication . During visit , participant complete measure before—medical history , physical exam , blood test—and give dose anti-HIV medication regimen . After receive medication , participant monitor give blood sample 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 hour . For Groups G , H , I , J , K L intensive 12-hour PK study schedule least 30 day combination interest . For Groups , intensive 12-hour PK study perform within 35 day ( 5 week ) screening/entry evaluation . Medications provide study . Results 12-hour medication monitoring test deliver participant ' physician within 6 week . If , base result , physician decides change dosage participant 's medication , participant may ask complete second PK visit . Participants must receive revise dose least 14 day PK study repeat .</detailed_description>
