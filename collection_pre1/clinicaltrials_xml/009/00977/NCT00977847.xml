	<brief_summary>In 21st century , importance family health history increase essential put detail personal genetic information context individual 's health , namely context share code play individual his/her close relative . These scientific development investigator ' understand genetics demand comprehensive family history dataset patient , time limitation healthcare provider demand technology-driven solution integrate individual 's knowledge family history medical record maintain health care provider . A solution currently exist Americans organize family health history place electronic health record ( EHR ) . The investigator propose develop compare three different way proactively collect family history information patient use computer technology independent health care visit , include telephone ( interactive voice response technology ) , tablet computer physician 's wait room , secure internet portal home . These tool base US Surgeon General 's My Family Health Portrait , electronic family history collection tool . Family history data transfer integrated patient 's EHR large primary care network . This project seek demonstrate family history data accurately report diverse patient use technology , data integrate tailor individual 's health care base familial risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrating Patient Generated Family Health History From Varied Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) Entry Portals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The long established wisdom include family health history key part individual 's medical record invigorate new emphasis personalize medicine . While past , family health history use understand individual 's disease risk focus disease prevention effort , 21st century medicine , family health history 's importance increase essential put detail personal genetic information clinical context , namely context share code play person 's close relative . This new need family health history demand comprehensive family history dataset patient , time limitation face healthcare provider demand technology-driven solution whereby patient performs primary data entry provider refines data . Solutions currently exist Americans organize family health history place electronic health record ( EHR ) . My Family Health Portrait ( MFHP ) open source , electronic family history collection tool develop Surgeon General offer interoperability EHRs , yet knowledge widely integrated limitation capacity many EHRs accept data , barrier systematic collection data clinical practice . Additionally , obstacle exist individual computer literate access home computer . In order capture patient-generated family history data across diverse patient population , EHR 's may need offer patient variety data entry option allow difference preference , convenience , computer literacy , computer availability . This proposal seek develop new resource family history data entry EHR . These resource develop , test validated primary care set within large complex healthcare system . Research Plan : The propose project examine reach , effectiveness , adoption implementation three innovative portal transfer integrate patient generate family history data EHR . Specific Aim 1 ( technical development ) develop three portal entry patient generate family history data integrate EHR . The pathway include : : ( 1 ) computer tablet wait room complete MFHP , ( 2 ) secure internet portal transfer data collect patient home use MFHP , ( 3 ) interactive voice response ( IVR ) system collect necessary data element phone . Each modality interface EHR large health delivery system use current data standard . Each modality design interface EHR large health delivery system use current data standard use current data standard . Specific Aim 2 ( content development validation ) evaluate facilitator barrier adoption , implementation three electronic portal assess difference patient preference , privacy concern , convenience , understand . The validity family history data collect three portal also assess genetic counselor . Specific Aim 3 ( pilot randomize controlled trial ) conduct 4-armed pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) measure reach effectiveness integrate family history data patient 's EHR . The trial examine compare change family history documentation , patient-doctor discussion family history , patient provider satisfaction data entry portal describe Aim 1 , well control arm . The trial conduct pilot cluster RCT select practice within Brigham Women 's Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network . Potential Impact : The impact obtain accurate family history data integrate individual 's health record substantial , grow importance understanding genome advance . This project ultimately contribute well understand available technology integrate EHR 's obtain accurate family history way allow widespread acquisition integration accurate family history data variety setting diverse patient population . The technology lesson learn project exportable healthcare setting throughout United States .</detailed_description>
