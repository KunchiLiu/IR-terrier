	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerability Combination Valproic Acid Lenalidomide Treatment Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment administer continuous therapy , i.e . take day describe without treatment interruption long criteria termination treatment meet . After two year primary endpoint evaluate . Non-responders take study 4 month therapy . Patients relapse initial response study treatment receive one attempt re-start therapy short duration discontinuation . Treatment Valproic Acid start day 1 . The dose Valproic Acid slowly increase . In morning day 13 trough level Valproic Acid check . The target range 50-110 µg/l . The dose Valproic Acid adjust depend trough level . In first eight week therapy weekly control Valproic Acid level require . Thereafter , Valproic Acid level check every four week . The plan dose lenalidomide 10 mg/day , orally continuous therapy . Dosing morning approximately time day . Capsules may take meal . In course study dose adjust result blood count . Only one cycle study drug ( 28 day ) supply patient every four week . Patients experience adverse event may need study treatment modification . During treatment study medication weekly control visit detection adverse event require first eight week , thereafter patient must see every four week . Therapeutic success evaluate 4-weekly interval . Bone marrow examine 12 week 48 week case premature study termination</detailed_description>
