	<brief_summary>Background : - Membranous nephropathy associate damage wall glomeruli , small blood vessel kidneys filter waste product blood . This damage cause leakage blood protein urine associate low blood protein level , high blood cholesterol value , swell leg . These problem decrease go away without treatment 25 percent patient , persist , patient may experience impaired ( loss ) kidney function , blood vessel heart disease , risk form blood clot vein . - Kidney biopsy show antibody deposit along glomeruli suggest specialize cell immune system , call B T cell , cause damage kidney increase activity . To suppress action B T cell decrease harmful deposit kidney , drug treatment require . - Patients membranous nephropathy often treat immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine cytoxan plus steroid attempt reduce suppress activity immune system , decrease antibody production , reduce antibody deposit kidney . However , everyone responds medication kidney disease return patient drug stop . Also , side effect associate long term usage medication . Rituximab , different immunosuppressant , also use purpose . Although cyclosporine Rituximab use separately , tried combination possible treatment membranous nephropathy . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness combine rituximab cyclosporine treat membranous nephropathy . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose membranous nephropathy base kidney biopsy do within precede 24 month , excess level protein urine least 6 month base urine blood test . Design : - Potential participant screen initial clinic evaluation full medical history . - Before treatment , run-in period last 2 month . During time , participant place blood pressure lower medication take immunosuppressant medication . - Participants visit NIH clinical center baseline evaluation , four intravenous infusion rituximab , also 1- 6-month interval throughout study . - Active treatment period involve 6-month course cyclosporine total four dos rituximab . Participants take cyclosporine tablet twice daily , two infusion rituximab give 2 week apart , After 6 month , cyclosporine dose slowly decreased several week completely discontinue . Participants receive another course ( two dose 2 week apart ) rituximab , depend result blood work . - Participants frequent blood urine test perform monitor result treatment reduce chance side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Cyclosporine Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot intervention study evaluate preliminary evidence safety effectiveness novel combination immunosuppressive regimen , Rituximab plus cyclosporine , treatment idiopathic membranous nephropathy . Membranous nephropathy condition affect kidney involve damage wall tiny blood vessel filter kidney call glomerulus . This damage allow blood protein leak urine ( proteinuria ) . As result , patient low protein level blood , high blood cholesterol level often develop leg swelling . This combination symptoms sign call nephrotic syndrome . Some patient membranous nephropathy develop impair kidney function proportion patient may develop kidney failure . The immunosuppressive drug often use treat membranous nephropathy include cyclophosphamide plus steroids cyclosporine . These vary effectiveness among patient side effect treatment . Rituximab alone use experimentally treat membranous nephropathy small clinical trial . It associate decreased proteinuria variable degree patient . The purpose pilot study evaluate whether combination Rituximab plus cyclosporine , two drug different effect immune system , result great number remission nephrotic syndrome sustain remission expect cyclosporine alone . Although medication use separately membranous nephropathy , potential benefit risk combination yet formally explore . Patients age 18 year old idiopathic membranous nephropathy eligible participate study . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Candidates must persistent nephrotic syndrome despite 6 month observation period treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , review medical record kidney biopsy result . Participants come NIH Bethesda , Maryland evaluation receive intravenous infusion Rituximab . Two dos Rituximab give ( 2 week apart ) . Participants also take cyclosporine pill twice day . After 6 month , dose cyclosporine taper several week discontinue . Patients re-treated second course Rituximab ( two infusion give two week apart ) minimum 6 month pass since complete first course Rituximab . The exact timing second course Rituximab depend result blood test . All patient follow minimum 24 month time therapy initiate .</detailed_description>

Immunosuppressive medication experimental medication type three month period prior initiate Rituximab cyclosporine . 4 . Prior exposure cyclosporine tacrolimus 6 month and/or evidence intolerance toxicity associate cyclosporine treatment duration include irreversible azotemia , liver dysfunction hypertension . 5 . Prior treatment Rituximab . 6 . Clinically significant medical condition ( i.e . severe heart failure NYHA class IV , uncontrolled coronary artery disease/unstable angina ) , opinion investigator , could increase subject risk participate study could confound interpretation result study . Patients history arrhythmias evaluate cardiology consultant regard recommendation Rituximab report exacerbate arrhythmia ( patient rheumatoid arthritis ) . 7 .
