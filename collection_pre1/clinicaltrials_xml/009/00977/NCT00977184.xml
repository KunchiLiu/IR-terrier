	<brief_summary>Background : - In transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , device create short-lasting magnetic field induces electric current brain leading change activity brain cell . There different effect brain different rate stimulation . In previous study people Parkinson 's disease , repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) give particular rate temporarily improve ability walk . A fast rate rTMS may effective treat symptom rate originally use . - This study compare active rTMS inactive ( sham Placebo ) rTMS . Half people study active rTMS ; half brain stimulation rTMS . Objectives : - To see fast rate transcranial magnetic stimulation effective treatment symptom Parkinson 's disease slow rate study . Eligibility : - Individuals 40 80 year age diagnose mild moderate Parkinson 's disease . - Participants must currently take Sinemet dopamine agonist drug ( e.g. , bromocriptine , cabergoline , pergolide , pramipexole , ropinirole , apomorophine , rotigotine ) , willing continue treatment duration study . Design : - This study require 11 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center 6 week . Participants also admit stay inpatient NIH Clinical Center entire study period ( 10 visit first week follow-up visit month later ) . - Initial visit consist physical examination ; test participant ' time walk 10 meter ; question memory , mood , quality life . Participants take Parkinson 's disease medication 12 hour visit ; examination test complete , participant able take medication . Researchers repeat test 1 hour participant take medication . - TMS session : 8 TMS session ( 4 session per week ) 2 week . Each stimulation session last half hour . Half participant receive active TMS ; half receive sham TMS . - The first 10 participant additional test study safety rapid TMS patient Parkinson 's disease . - A day complete last TMS session , participant repeat test first visit take medication first assessment respond question mood , memory , quality life . - One month complete last TMS session , participant repeat test first visit take medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To demonstrate cumulative long-lasting improvement parkinsonian symptom 50 Hz rTMS ( repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) safety Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient . Study population : Up 30 PD patient Hoehn Yahr disease stage 2-4 medication enrol . Patients must receive 300 mg levodopa ( include dopamine agonist ) gait problem . Design : This randomize , double-blind , placebo ( sham ) -controlled study 26 patient PD 2 group ( real versus sham stimulation ) . The study involve performance ( 8 intervention ) 50 Hz rTMS large circular coil motor cortex side brain . Assessment PD symptoms standard test motor function perform one-month period . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint include change gait speed assessed time take walk 10 meter change bradykinesia assess measuring time take 10 combined hand arm movement . Secondary endpoint include change total , motor activity daily live Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) score .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Men woman age 40 80 year DOPAresponsive PD Hoehn Yahr grade 2 4 Must regimen include levodopa Total dose levodopa dopamine agonist ( use dopamine equivalent ) equal 300 milligram per day problem walk gait time 10meter distance great six second EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any active psychiatric disease History seizures epilepsy Concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug antiparkinsonian agent could lower seizure threshold except SSRI Pallidotomy , implant electrode generator deep brain stimulation Pregnancy Surgically traumatically implant foreign body pacemaker , implant medical pump , implant hearing aid , metal plate skull , metal implant skull eye ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard TEP . Study would cause undue risk stress reason tendency fall , excessive fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehensiveness . Dementia assess Folstein 's MiniMental Test Examination ( MMSE le equal 24/30 ) mentally impaired patient capacity provide consent ( physician establish diagnosis apply UPDRS evaluate patient 's mental capacity use conventional clinical interview ) Unable walk 10meter distance . More occasional fall , i.e . daily fall ( correspond score great equal 3 UPDRS item 13 ) , history fall ( ) significant injury , absence postural response and/or spontaneous loss balance condition ( correspond score great equal 2 great equal 3 on/off condition , respectively , UPDRS item 30 ) Pregnancy unusual patient PD , grade 24 . Urine sample pregnancy test obtain patient childbearing potential prior start 50 Hz rTMS also initial interview sign consent form . Women childbearing potential asked take appropriate measure prevent pregnancy study .</criteria>
