	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab paclitaxel , carboplatin , temsirolimus ixabepilone , carboplatin , bevacizumab see well work treat patient stage III , stage IV , recurrent endometrial cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat patient endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate hazard progression death three arm relative historical control patient advance recurrent endometrial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine nature , frequency , maximum degree toxicity assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 3.0 three arm . II . To estimate distribution duration overall survival three arm . III . To estimate proportion patient measurable disease confirm objective tumor response treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore association select biomarkers progression-free survival well secondary measure clinical outcome ( overall survival , tumor response , disease status possible ) context histologic cell type treatment . IA . Somatic mutation phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) / phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) RAS pathway member Sequenom mutational profiling target sequence candidate gene . IB . Microsatellite instability analysis five National Cancer Institute consensus microsatellite marker ( BAT25 , BAT26 , D2S2123 , D5S346 , D17S250 ) use Applied Biosystems ( ABI ) Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer . IC . Copy number alteration ( gain loss ) array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) . ID . Tumor expression PTEN class III beta-tubulin use immunohistochemistry . IE . Concentration vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pre-cycle 1 plasma use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . II . Explore relationship among various biomarkers histologic subtype treatment . III . Explore combination biomarkers clinical covariates optimally predict responsiveness resistance three treatment arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab* IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients undergo treatment post-surgery ( = &lt; 12 week ) receive bevacizumab begin course 2 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 temsirolimus* IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients undergo treatment post-surgery ( = &lt; 12 week ) receive temsirolimus begin course 2 . ARM III : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab* IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients undergo treatment post-surgery ( = &lt; 12 week ) receive bevacizumab begin course 2 . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
