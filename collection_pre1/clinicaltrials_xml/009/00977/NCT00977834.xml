	<brief_title>Assessment Older Adults With Cancer : Feasibility Computer Survey Methodology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients old age 65 , comparison young 65 , 11-fold increase cancer incidence 16-fold increase cancer mortality . The population risk grow rapidly : number adult age 65 older expect double next 30 year . In order adequately care grow population old adult , oncologist need assessment tool provide information regard old individual 's `` functional age '' comparison `` chronological age .

Pilot data demonstrate feasibility assessment complete less 30 minute ; however , assessment complete `` pencil paper '' require interviewer deliver score assessment . Loscalzo , Clark , colleague develop computer methodology order ass need patient cancer age . The assessment complete patient score algorithm develop provide summary patient 's need healthcare team . This assessment highly successful identify needs patient age . In protocol , merge research interest Hurria , Loscalzo , Clark develop computer survey program capture physical psychological need older adult cancer . The goal study evaluate feasibility computer survey methodology among old adult cancer . For purpose protocol accrue patient lymphoma lung cancer . Schema : 1 . Identify old adult ( age 65 old ) lymphoma lung cancer . 2 . Describe study patient : patient consent refuse . 3 . Consenting patient complete geriatric assessment via computer survey . 4 . The following feasibility data capture : length time complete assessment , patient 's need assistance complete assessment , satisfaction use computer survey methodology complete assessment . 5 . The primary caretaker ( available ) invite participate protocol complete caregiver 's survey patient 's needs question caregiver burden .</detailed_description>
