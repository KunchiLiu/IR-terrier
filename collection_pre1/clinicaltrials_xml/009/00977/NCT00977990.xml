	<brief_summary>Background : - Polyomavirus DNA-based virus infect vertebrate , include human . Most people harm polyomavirus infection , people compromise immune system may harm virus , great risk develop certain type rare cancer . - A recently discover virus call Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) type skin infection commonly find human . By use skin swab collect MCV , researcher hope develop laboratory culture model MCV future research . Objectives : - To use skin swab collect sample Merkel cell polyomavirus future study . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old employed National Cancer Institute 's Laboratory Cellular Oncology . Design : - Participants wipe cotton swab across forehead eyebrow , break end swab microcentrifuge tube . This procedure perform work hour . - No treatment procedure give part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amplification Merkel Cell Polyomavirus From Skin Swabs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyomaviruses class DNA-based virus infect vertebrate , include human . A majority humans chronically infected multiple polyomavirus type . In immunocompetent subject , chronic polyomavirus infection generally harmless . A recently-discovered virus call Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) believe chronically infect skin substantial fraction adult subject . It recently show MCV DNA amplify skin swab specimen use PCR method . The goal study recover full-length ( 5.5 kb ) MCV genomes skin swab specimen take healthy laboratory volunteer . We recombine recover MCV genome attempt propagate cell culture . If successful , work would provide first laboratory culture model MCV replication . The recombinant DNA work receive approval NIH Institutional Biosafety Committee Our study population would draw roughly two dozen co-worker Lab Cellular Oncology 's Building 37 Sections . LCO co-worker appeal study population generally familiar biology MCV . Candidate study participant remind , give high prevalence asymptomatic MCV infection among healthy adult , detection MCV DNA skin swab clearly construe diagnostic , clinical social significance . Subjects agree participate study wipe cotton swab across forehead eyebrow . Study subject break end swab microcentrifuge tube . To avoid study participation federal work hour , specimen collection perform prior study subject 's work shift . Each sample assign letter code . A key letter code exist Dr. Buck 's secure NCI server space . Given non-invasive nature sample clear lack potential harm arise study participation , proposal appear eligible expedite review IRB 's Special Studies section .</detailed_description>
