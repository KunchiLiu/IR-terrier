	<brief_summary>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) common condition characterise abdominal pain discomfort alter bowel habit affect 10 % population . There several group patient base differ bowel pattern include IBS diarrhea ( IBS-D ) post infective IBS ( PI-IBS ) whose symptom begin acute infection . Saccharomyces cerevisiae , yeast use bread make show reduce duration infectious diarrhoea . Part benefit maybe destroy bacterial toxin . Recent study suggest increase protease ( chemical breakdown protein ) stool patient IBS-D . The investigator think yeast may benefit patient IBS-D PI-IBS reducing amount protease stool . This important protease show potentially important generate discomfort experience patient . The investigator study patient chronic IBS-D receive 2 week treatment yeast placebo follow 4 week gap 2 week treatment placebo yeast , treatment allocate randomly . The investigator also study 30 subject still persistent loose bowel function 6 week infection Campylobacter jejuni , one commonest cause gastroenteritis UK . Subjects randomise take either yeast placebo 4 week . In study , investigator examine effect treatment stool protease , stool frequency consistency abdominal discomfort ; investigator also take blood sample examine aspect immune system function . The result study may suggest yeast provide benefit patient IBS diarrhea provide data large clinical trial .</brief_summary>
