	<brief_summary>Central sensitisation increase excitability nerve within central nervous system , lead heighten sensitivity certain stimulus . This process involve chronic pain condition e.g . migraine non−cardiac chest pain . Recent work group suggest central sensitisation may important mechanism lead chronic cough . The main question study include : 1 . Can investigators induce temporary central sensitisation cough reflex healthy volunteer test new medication ? 2 . Can investigators demonstrate exaggerated sensitisation patient chronic cough ( indicate patient already centrally sensitise ) ? In animal study , acid infusion gullet ( oesophagus ) able induce central sensitisation cough reflex . Acid infusion oesophagus also show induce central sensitisation human healthy volunteer , increase sensitivity pain front chest study test cough reflex . Using human participant , investigator plan test whether acid infusion oesophagus increase sensitivity cough reflex healthy volunteer also patient complain chronic cough .</brief_summary>
