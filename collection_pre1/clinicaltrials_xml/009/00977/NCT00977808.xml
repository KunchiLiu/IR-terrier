	<brief_summary>This study plan link two exist technology , insulin pump continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) , essentially develop artificial pancreas , i.e. , closed-loop . This do use two continuous glucose monitor ( CGMs ) , computer contain investigational control algorithm use glucose information CGM recommend insulin dosing , insulin pump . The purpose study test ability continuous glucose monitor together insulin pump mathematical formula control blood sugar level people type 1 diabetes . The Closed-Loop control algorithm : 1 . Suggest adequate insulin delivery blood glucose control steady state ( overnight ) ; 2 . Cover adequately insulin bolus pre-set carbohydrate content breakfast . If successful , study conceptually prove feasibility automate model-predictive closed-loop glucose control T1DM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Closed-Loop Glucose Control People With Type 1 Diabetes ( BPK004 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient outpatient screen evaluation , two 22 h overnight hospital admission separate 2- 4-week waiting period . Each inpatient admission begin 15:00 end 13:00 following day . Subjects ate dinner lunch carbohydrate content admission 1 admission 2 identical morning meal Ensure Plus ( Abbott Nutrition , Columbus , OH ) . Two day admission , two Freestyle Navigator CGM device ( Abbott Diabetes Care ) continuous glucose monitor apply patient allow stabilization sensor assessment performance . During admission 1 , open-loop control use , subject ' usual insulin routine personal insulin pump . During admission 2 , OmniPod Insulin Management System ( Insulet Corp. ) insert used closed-loop control blood glucose . Insulin lispro ( Eli Lilly , Indianapolis , IN ) , choose base commercial assay available , use inpatient admission . At begin admission 2 , one two CGM device designate primary , closed-loop control algorithm use data system , unless problem detect . At 17:00 , model-predictive control ( MPC ) initiate data-collection mode , automatically receive CGM data every minute . Administration predinner insulin bolus overseen attend physician . MPC , closed-loop control begin 21:30 continue 12:00 next day total 14.5 h. Per FDA restriction , algorithm automatically control insulin pump . Instead , algorithm suggest insulin bolus every 15 min , , accept , programmed insulin pump attend physician . This do safety reason , allow physician override insulin delivery suggestion time . Reference blood glucose ( use YSI Life Sciences Beckman glucose analyzer ) sample every 30 min . The protocol require switching frequent 15 min reference blood glucose sample hypoglycemia occur imminent . Fast-acting carbohydrate ( glucose tablet fruit juice ) give reference blood glucose fell 3.9 mmol/liter , regardless CGM reading .</detailed_description>
