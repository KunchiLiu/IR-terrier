	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance ( MR ) image able detect certain heart abnormality , coronary artery narrowing . To purpose , conventional MR contrast medium ( Gd-DTPA-BMA ) use adenosine infusion ( approve substance enlarges artery heart , blood flow heart muscle increase ) . This magnetic resonance imaging technique compare single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , well-established technique detect heart abnormality . Both , cardiac MR SPECT compare invasive coronary angiography , technique directly visualized heart vessel narrowing ( =standard reference ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multicentre , open label , phase III study adult subject design show Gd-DTPA-BMA ( conventional MR contrast medium = OMNISCAN ) enhance myocardial MR perfusion image non-inferior myocardial SPECT . Both image technique perform adenosine stress ( 0.14mg/min/kg 3 minute IV ) . Gd-DTPA-BMA use twice ( 2 dose 0.075 mmol/kg stress rest study ) detection myocardial perfusion defect . The standard reference invasive coronary angiography , defines presence coronary artery disease , vessel least 2mm diameter show stenosis least 50 % ( diameter reduction ) . Patients history myocardial infarction ( ) positive coronary artery disease , even coronary artery stenosed evidenced coronary angiography perform set trial ( = assign patient positive coronary artery disease successful PCI-revascularization acute infarct ( ) past ) .</detailed_description>
