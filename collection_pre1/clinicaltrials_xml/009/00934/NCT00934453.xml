	<brief_summary>This study single site , Phase I , mask , randomize study evaluate safety tolerability twice daily dose LGG ( Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 ) normal healthy adult volunteer . Study drug capsule ( 1x10^10 LGG/capsule placebo ) take mouth twice day cow 's milk soy milk outpatient basis . Volunteers study visit baseline , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 7 month , 12 month ask medical problem come since last study visit , vital sign take , review current medication use , review sign potential adverse event . Blood urine sample also collect visit , well throat stool sample . Our goal ass safety tolerability LGG administer healthy adult volunteer twice day . Assessment safety determine vital sign measurement , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , incidence severity adverse event occur study participation . Additionally , ass whether LGG colonize throat and/or gastrointestinal tract healthy adult volunteer assess effect LGG bacteria normally live throat GI tract use culture-independent technique . Volunteers enrol study also invite participate companion genetic study investigate host immune response bacteria LGG .</brief_summary>
