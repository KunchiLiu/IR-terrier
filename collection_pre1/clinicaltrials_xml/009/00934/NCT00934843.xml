	<brief_title>Preoperative Corticosteroid Therapy Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose randomize controlled trial use glucocorticoid improve clinical course neonates post-cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . The study focus neonate reason . Although post-CPB clinical course typically severe intensive care unit ( ICU ) care prolong old child , mode morbidity also well characterize . Further , high level severity provide substrate identify positive effect particular therapy . Finally , therapy identify beneficial great potential benefit vulnerable population . The well characterize scenario low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) use primary endpoint , variety secondary endpoint related biochemical anti-inflammatory effect therapy , ICU care late neurological outcome .</detailed_description>
