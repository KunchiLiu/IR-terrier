	<brief_title>Candida Respiratory Tract Secretions Critically Ill Patients The Efficacy Antifungal Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Candida spp . commonly retrieve microbiologic specimen ICU patient suspect VAP . It associate increased systemic inflammation worse clinical outcome . This association may due propensity Candida colonize sicker , increased level systemic inflammation worse clinical outcome . However , alternate possibility Candida colonizer responsible clinical biochemical feature observe . The way clarify pathogenic role Candida patient population treat organism see patient improve compare untreated group . The purpose research program conduct study determine Candida respiratory tract secretion routinely treat critically ill patient . Since definitive randomize controlled trial design demonstrate reduction mortality would large , require commitment large amount resource include time money , investigator propose first conduct small pilot feasibility study . Eligible patient randomize receive antifungal treatment anidulafungin placebo . Following enrollment , study treatment ( placebo ) start soon possible . When Candida yeast organisms speciate and/or susceptibility profile know , study medication adjust base susceptibility pattern . The investigator propose treat antifungal therapy total 14 day . Patients follow daily entire stay ICU till day 28 , whichever come first . For patient discharge ICU ward , follow study treatment complete ( i.e . day 14 ) . Mortality determine ICU stay , hospital stay 90 day . The investigator record admission discharge date ICU , step unit , hospital . All patient 13 mL blood/day drawn baseline , day 3 , day 8 end treatment period day 14 ( last day treatment ) . The sample prepare site shipped central lab processing . The investigator use blood specimen measure marker inflammation ( C-reactive protein , Procalcitonin , Interleukin-6 others determine investigator ) , marker candida presence ( b-glucan potential future marker ) marker immune dysfunction ( determined investigator ) .</detailed_description>
