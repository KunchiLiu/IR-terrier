	<brief_summary>I . Specific Aims Pelvic organ prolapse common distress condition frequently associate stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) often require surgical repair . Abdominal sacral colpopexy preferred operation repair pelvic prolapse . As many 91 % woman pelvic organ prolapse undergo sacral colpopexy also experience SUI . In addition , 44 % previously continent woman develop SUI incontinence sacral colpopexy : perhaps sacral colpopexy may predispose open bladder neck secure tightly . The selection surgical procedure prevent manage SUI woman undergo sacral colpopexy empiric rather evidence-based . Conceptually , mid-urethral sling may effective Burch procedure prevent urinary leakage sling provide outlet resistance beyond bladder neck therefore may compensate downward tension bladder neck result sacral colpopexy . Indeed , clinical observation suggest mid-urethral sling effective among woman persistent urinary incontinence sacral colpopexy Burch procedure . Therefore , investigator ' global hypothesis mid-urethral sling preferable Burch procedure prevent improve stress urinary incontinence woman undergo sacral colpopexy pelvic organ prolapse . The investigator ' SPECIFIC AIMS evaluate objective subjective outcome 6 , 12 24 month 124 woman urinary incontinence advance pelvic organ prolapse . All woman undergo sacral colpopexy randomize either Burch procedure mid-urethral sling . The primary endpoint composite continence 6 month secondary endpoint include composite continence subjective measure incontinence , patient satisfaction morbidity associate procedure . The investigator ' hypothesis follow : 1 . At 6 month , urinary continence rate higher mid-urethral Burch procedure . Urine continence assess composite measure incontinence : subjective complaint , interim treatment , negative standardized stress test perform mask observer . This assessment repeat 12 24 month post-operatively establish medium term continence two procedure . Subjective continence patient satisfaction measure obtain visit use standardized questionnaire pelvic organ support quantify Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification ( POP-Q ) score . 2 . Early event ( e.g. , blood loss , operative time , intra-operative complication ( vascular , bowel urological injury ) , in-hospital complication ( need transfusion , febrile morbidity , thrombotic event , wound infection , length stay , duration bladder catheterization ileus ) delay postoperative complication ( e.g. , wound infection , mesh erosion , bowel obstruction obstruct void ) collect compare safety procedure .</brief_summary>
