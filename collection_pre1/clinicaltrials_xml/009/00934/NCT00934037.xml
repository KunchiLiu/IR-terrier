	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate diagnostic accuracy multi-detector compute tomography use 320 detector identify combination coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50 % correspond myocardium perfusion defect patient suspect coronary artery disease compare conventional coronary angiography single photon emission compute tomography myocardium perfusion imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Non-invasive Coronary Angiography Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Using 320 Detector Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Combined Coronary angiography myocardial perfusion image use 320 detector compute tomography ( CORE-320 ) design prospective , multi-center , international , blind study design evaluate diagnostic accuracy multi-detector compute tomography use 320 detector identify coronary artery luminal stenosis correspond myocardium perfusion defect patient suspect coronary artery disease . The primary analysis comparison diagnostic capability combination quantitative 320-MDCT angiography quantitative perfusion image combination conventional coronary angiography SPECT myocardial perfusion image patient level . A positive patient define least one vessel ≥ 50 % diameter stenosis define quantitative coronary angiography correspond positive SPECT territorial myocardial perfusion defect .</detailed_description>
