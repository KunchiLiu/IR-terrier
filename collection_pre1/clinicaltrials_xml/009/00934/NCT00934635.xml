	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare effect two different antipsychotic compound use treatment schizophrenia ( paliperidone ER risperidone ) target sit two specific area brain patient schizophrenia .

	<brief_title>A Positron-Emission-Tomography ( PET ) Study Measure Blockade Dopamine Receptors ( D2 ) Specific Areas Brain Relation Plasma Concentrations Paliperidone Extended Release ( ER ) Oral Risperidone Schizophrenia Patients Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , non-randomized ( patient assign treatment group ) , phase IV , monocentric ( one single study site ) interventional study evaluate block effect two different dos paliperidone ER oral risperidone dopamine D2 receptor brain subchronic patient schizophrenia . Dopamine substance produce release brain . Research indicate dopamine level elevate area brain acute schizophrenia psychosis . Antipsychotic medication like risperidone paliperidone ER use treat psychosis block dopamine receptor . Fallypride radioactive tracer ( drug emit radioactivity ) bind dopamine receptor brain much antipsychotic medication . It compete antipsychotic compound bind site use perform specialized x-ray know Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Imaging . After patient receives Fallypride , temporally bind specific target area brain emits brief harmless radioactive signal detect PET Scanner . Since paliperidone ER risperidone compete Fallypride target site , signal differ accord bind effect compound . This technique provide image show direct effect medication human brain allow comparison effect different medication make . As effect fluctuate depend concentration drug blood , study , PET measurement correlate blood level sample . Patients receive either paliperidone ER ( 6 patient 6 mg per day , 6 patient 9 mg per day ) oral risperidone ( 6 patient 4 mg per day , 6 patient 6 mg per day ) . The primary objective study compare block effect medication dopamine D2 receptor different time point ( shortly take medication 24 hour take medication ) correlate blood level medication . The study consist 3 visit 3 consecutive day . Blood level assess treatment group 1 4 day 2 day 3 group 5 8 day 3 ( accord last intake study medication ) . PET-Scans assessed every group day 3 . Group 1 4 consists patient whose PET Scan assess approximately 2 hour take medication ( group 1 receive paliperidone ER 6 mg , group 2 receive paliperidone ER 9 mg , group 3 receive risperidone 4 mg , group 4 receive risperidone 6 mg ) . Group 5 8 consists patient whose PET Scan assess approximately 24 hour take medication ( group 5 receive paliperidone ER 6 mg , group 6 receive paliperidone ER 9 mg , group 7 receive risperidone 4 mg , group 8 receive risperidone 6 mg ) . Adverse Events ( AE 's ) assess report spontaneously throughout trial . The dose antipsychotic medication represent frequent dose use post acute treatment schizophrenia . A group healthy volunteer ( group 9 ) serve control group measure fallypride dopamine D2- receptor occupancy normal circumstance , patient affect schizophrenia . Patients receive dosage throughout study prescribe prior start study either paliperidone ER 6 mg tablet daily 9 mg tablet daily risperidone 4 mg tablet daily 6 mg daily ( two 3 mg tablet ) .</detailed_description>
