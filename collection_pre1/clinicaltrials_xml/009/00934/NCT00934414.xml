	<criteria>Non Smoking : Clinical diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus . Non Smoking : Current basal prandial insulin therapy least 6 week either alone combination = 2 OHA Non Smoking : Negative urine cotinine test . Non Smoking : Nonsmoker least 2 year . Smoking : Clinical diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus . Smoking : Have smoke least 5 year Non Smoking : Body Mass Index ( BMI ) = 40 kg/m2 . Non Smoking : Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) = 12 % . Non Smoking : If medication ( oral antidiabetic agent ) addition insulin take screening , subject must stable regimen define continue use dose medication period least 12 week immediately prior trial enrollment . Non Smoking : Forced expiratory volume one second / force vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) = NHANES III predict Lower Limit Normal . Non Smoking : FVC = 80 % NHANES III predict value . Non Smoking : DLco = 70 % ( uncorrected ) Miller predict value . Non Smoking : No upper respiratory infection within last 15 day low respiratory infection within last 30 day . Non Smoking : Must nonchildbearing potential use adequate birth control measure Smoking : Positive cotinine test . Smoking : Current basal prandial insulin therapy least 6 week either alone combination = oral antihyperglycemic agent . Smoking : BMI = 40 kg/m2 . Smoking : HbA1c 12 % . Smoking : If medication ( oral antidiabetic agent ) addition insulin take screening , subject must stable regimen define continue use dose medication period least 12 week immediately prior trial enrollment . Smoking : FEV1/FVC = NHANES III Predicted Lower Limit Normal Smoking : FEV1 FVC = 60 % NHANES III predict value . Smoking : DLco = 70 % ( uncorrected ) Miller predict value . Smoking : No upper respiratory infection within last 15 day low respiratory infection within last 30 day . Smoking : Must nonchildbearing potential use adequate birth control measure . Diabetes mellitus type 1 . Total daily insulin requirement = 1.4 U/kg . Intake drug herbal preparation , evaluation Investigator , may interfere clinical trial result cause clinically relevant interference glucose utilization , insulin action , recovery hypoglycemia ( eg , systemic corticosteroid , oral inhaled glucocorticosteroids ) . History hypersensitivity trial drug drug similar chemical structure . Treatment investigational drug within 90 day prior enrollment trial . Progressive fatal disease . History malignancy within five year trial entry ( basal cell carcinoma ) . Evidence severe secondary complication diabetes ( neuropathy , nephropathy evidence creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL female &gt; 1.8 mg/dL male , Stage III IV retinopathy ( accord MKC diabetic retinopathy scale , see Appendix 1.1 protocol ) , severe peripheral vascular disease ) . Previous history anaphylaxis angioedema . Evidence clinically significant autonomic neuropathy ( gastroparesis , orthostatic hypotension hypoglycemia unawareness ) . Myocardial infarction stroke within precede six ( 6 ) month . Positive hepatitis B ( HBsAg ) positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) serology active Hepatitis C ( HepCAb ) screening . History presence clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , gastrointestinal , neurological infectious disorder capable alter absorption , metabolism elimination drug , constitute significant risk factor take trial medication . ALT AST &gt; 3 time upper limit normal reference range . Anemia ( hemoglobin level &lt; 11 g/dL female &lt; 12 g/dL male ) . Ongoing respiratory infection . Prior diagnosis systemic autoimmune collagen vascular disease require previous current treatment systemic corticosteroid , cytotoxic drug , penicillamine Pregnancy , lactation , intent become pregnant trial period . Women childbearing potential practicing inadequate birth control ( adequate birth control define use oral contraceptive , condom diaphragms spermicide , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization ) . Current drug alcohol abuse ( regular alcohol intake &gt; 14 units/week ) , history opinion investigator would make subject suitable candidate participation trial . A unit alcohol define 8 g ethanol , ¼ liter beer 1 glass wine 1 measure spirit . Investigator site personnel directly affiliate trial , immediate family . Immediate family define spouse , parent , child sibling , whether biological legally adopt .</criteria>
