	<brief_summary>The purpose study safety effectiveness oral AT-101 give standard dose erlotinib ( Tarceva ) patient older 18 advanced non-small cell lung cancer , relapse progress prior platinum-based chemotherapy . It propose effect AT-101 may improve clinical benefit erlotinib patient advance NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tarceva AT-101 Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause death United States well worldwide . It estimate approximately 215,020 new case lung cancer diagnose United States 2008 , approximately 161,840 death ( 1 ) . The great majority lung cancer group non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , 13 % small cell lung cancer . Most patient NSCLC present advance disease ( 55 % stage IIIB IV ) . The overall median survival patient advance NSCLC treat first line platinum base doublet less 12 month ( 8 10 month ) 1 year 2 year survival 33 % 11 % , respectively ( 2-4 ) . Agents target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , matrix metalloproteinase , farnesyl transferase , protein kinase C retinoic X receptor far show survival benefit combination chemotherapy advance NSCLC ( 5-10 ) . More recently , 2 trial show clinical evidence anti tumor activity addition bevacizumab first line chemotherapy patient advance NSCLC ( 11,12 ) . The pivotal study ( EGOC 4599 ) responsible approval bevacizumab combination carboplatin plus paclitaxel selective patient advance non squamous cell lung cancer demonstrate 2 month improvement median survival ( 12.3 month versus 10.3 month ) , high objective response rate ( 12 ) . Patients disease progression first line therapy may candidate second line chemotherapy either docetaxel pemetrexed , result modest improvement survival . More recently , 2 EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) , gefitinib erlotinib , approve second third line therapy advance NSCLC ( 13,14 ) . The effect overall survival genotypically uncharacterized patient observe erlotinib ( BR21 trial ) , gefitinib ( ISEL trial ) , contribute withdrawal gefitinib United States , approval erlotinib second third line therapy NSCLC irrespective tumor genotype ( 15 ) . It propose effect AT-101 downstream signal pathway EGFR , particularly inhibition anti-apoptotic member Bcl-2 family protein , may provide opportunity improve clinical benefit erlotinib patient advance NSCLC . The safety combination erlotinib AT-101 assess . It therefore propose phase I study perform use standard ( FDA approve ) dose erlotinib ( 150 mg/day ) effective dose AT-101 ( 40 mg twice daily 3 day ) 3 week cycle .</detailed_description>
