	<detailed_description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) life-threatening monogenic disease prevalence 1 400-1000 livebirths . ADPKD cause mutation polycystic kidney disease 1 gene ( PKD1 ) ( approximately 85 % case ) polycystic kidney disease 2 gene ( PKD2 ) ( remain 15 % ) gene , encode polycystin-1 ( PC1 ) polycystin-2 ( PC2 ) , respectively . PC1 putative cell-surface , receptor-like protein yet to-be-identified ligand ( ) , PC2 channel protein high conductance Ca2+ . Polycystic liver disease ( PLD ) common extra-renal manifestation ADPKD , present &gt; 90 % ADPKD patient age 30 . Liver cyst ADPKD originate biliary micro-hamartoma focal proliferation biliary ductule peribiliary gland . Excessive proliferation biliary epithelial cell , combine neovascularization , alter cell-extracellular matrix ( ECM ) interaction/ECM remodel cAMP-mediated fluid secretion , require development expansion PLD liver cyst . PLD may become symptomatic acute complication cyst hemorrhage , rupture infection . Chronic symptom frequently associate massively enlarged PLD , include abdominal distension pain ; dyspnea ; gastroesophageal reflux early satiety may lead malnutrition ; mechanical low back pain ; obstruction inferior vena cava , hepatic portal vein ( lead dialysis-associated hypotension , hepatic venous outflow obstruction , portal hypertension ) biliary obstruction . Currently , apart invasive intervention cyst aspiration sclerosis , cyst fenestration combine hepatic resection cyst fenestration , liver transplantation , rarely , selective hepatic artery embolization , medical therapy available . The objective study conduct prospective , open-label , randomized trial examine effect sirolimus total liver volume kidney transplant recipient ADPKD . Four week follow kidney transplant , subject undergo iothalamate clearance measurement , 24-hour urine collection protein measurement physical examination transplant surgeon . Patients randomize receive either sirolimus-based immunosuppression continue tacrolimus-based immunosuppression unless one follow condition note : 1 . Complications kidney transplant incision , include , limited : superficial wound infection , deep wound infection , fascial dehiscence 2 . Iothalamate clearance measurement le 40 mL/min/1.72m^2 3 . Urinary protein excretion great 800 mg/24 hour . Subjects condition continue receive tacrolimus-based immunosuppression discretion treat physician/surgeon . Enrolled subject undergo abdominal pelvic CT scan within 3 month kidney transplantation one , two , three year kidney transplantation .</detailed_description>
