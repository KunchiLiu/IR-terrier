	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn specialized breathing device reduce sensation shortness breath patient advance cancer experience shortness breath . Researchers want learn device help control shortness breath . The 2 device test compare call BiPAP ( bilevel positive airway pressure ) Vapotherm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Oxygen Bilevel Airway Pressure Persistent Dyspnea Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Devices : The BiPAP device design help people get air lung without use much effort regular breathing . The air give mask , amount air set different level . The Vapotherm device also design deliver air lung . The air warm , filter bacteria , deliver nose use tube nostril . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - Group 1 receive air BiPAP 2 hour air Vapotherm 2 hour . - Group 2 receive air Vapotherm 2 hour air BiPAP 2 hour . The study staff help use device . If trouble one device , switch device 2-hour period . After use first device , wait 60 minute switch device . This wait period occur matter use first device full 2 hour . During wait period , return air delivery device oxygen level use start study . The study staff also check see still eligible use second device . Study Tests : During study period , vital sign level air breathe record use measure device chest . Before use device , rate hard catch breath . After use second device , fill questionnaire question device prefer . This take less 5 minute . Length Study : You study 5 hour . You take study device stop intolerable side effect occur use study device . Use Other Drugs : During 4-5 hour study period , allow take certain drug standard care may affect study test . These drug include certain pain-killer drug ( morphine hydromorphone ) , steroid ( prednisone dexamethasone ) , inhale drug ( ipratropium salbutamol ) . Any dos inhale drug ( regularly schedule dose `` need '' dos ) `` need '' dose pain-killer drug steroid fall within 4-5 hour study period put hold give right study complete . You may , however , choose take drug , either shortness breath control , drug need treat problem ( pain ) . If doctor decide take drug study period , take study receive drug . The reason stop study participation drug may affect rate shortness breath . This investigational study . The BIPAP Vapotherm device commercially available FDA approve deliver oxygen medically need , include patient advanced cancer . The investigational part study collect information ask patient rate well study device may affect shortness breath . Up 50 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
