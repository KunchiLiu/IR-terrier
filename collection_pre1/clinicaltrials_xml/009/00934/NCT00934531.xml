	<brief_summary>Compared cognitively normal old adult , mild cognitive problem ( MCI ) two-fold high rate fall , sustain fracture , high rate mortality due fall . Why old adult cognitive problem fall frequently completely understood . What known , however , attention necessary cognitive resource normal walk impairment attention associate increased risk fall old adult . It suggest cholinesterase inhibitor ( ChEI ) , medication use treatment dementia , may improve motor function walking ( gait performance ) . Since ChEI know improve attention , hypothesize ChEI reduce fall risk people MCI improve gait velocity , improve balance , reduce gait variability ; well-established risk factor fall . In proposed study , evaluate effect donepezil ( ChEI ) gait velocity , gait variability , balance 140 elderly individual MCI ( 70 intervention 70 control ) . Gait variable measure use electronic walkway , balance confidence use validate scale ( Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale ; ABC ) four month . By characterize understanding effect cognitive enhancer fall risk old adult cognitive impairment , able pave way new approach fall prevention population . We would establish medication augment cognitive function could complementary therapeutic option reduce fall risk people MCI . This may lead new approach prevent treat fall risk population , lead improve autonomy quality life senior early stage dementia , decrease burden Ontario health care system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donepezil Risk Falls Seniors With Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult cognitive problem high risk fall , annual incidence around 60-80 % ; least twice cognitively normal old adult . The consequence fall population quite serious ; faller cognitive problem approximately five time likely admit institutional care people cognitive issue fall . They also risk major fall-related injury fracture head injury lead increased mortality . Although reason increase fall risk cognitively impaired people completely understood , know impaired cognitive ability limit attentional resource allocation walk . As well , since executive function also important cognitive resource normal walk performance , impairment domain also associate dementia risk fall . Falls major cause disability dependence old Ontarians , especially experience cognitive problem , associate cost relate hospital admission , provision treatment , nurse home placement , form definite burden provincial health care system . One approach use understand risk fall people memory problem target early stage cognitive decline . Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) entity conceive transitional state benign age-related cognitive change early dementia . Specific diagnostic criterion develop validate diagnose MCI , prevalence diagnosis estimate 19 % among old adult , increase 29 % age 85 . People MCI find 10 15 time high risk develop Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , well high risk fall compare age-matched control . Although walk long consider primarily automatic motor task , emerge evidence suggest view may overly simplistic . Cognitive function may play key role regulation even routine walking , particularly old adult . Attention necessary cognitive resource maintain normal walk evidence cognitive attentional deficit independently associate postural instability , impairment perform daily living activity , future fall . The role cognition walk even mark people cognitive dysfunction , whose gait performance affect extra cognitive load . A sensitive way quantify gait performance assess gait variability . Gait variability define stride-to-stride variation time , quantifies automaticity gait , great variability indicate less rhythmicity unstable gait pattern . Evaluating gait variability offer accurate methodology identify subtle change walk pathological condition disease . For instance , cognitively normal old adult low gait variability ; however , high gait variability describe Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer disease , associate high risk future fall mobility decline . Additionally , previous study demonstrate gait variability may serve clinically relevant parameter evaluation mobility , may responsive measure different intervention fall prevention . Cholinesterase inhibitor try MCI individual goal delay progression dementia . A recent RCT demonstrate cognitive enhancer , specifically donepezil , might improve cognition population ; however , effect weak questionable clinical significance . Currently , indication use cognitive enhancer treat people MCI goal delay prevent functional mobility decline . Recently , suggest ChEI may improve gait performance improvement attentional resource allocation due fact ChEI know improve attention executive function . We expect result intervention donepezil 6 month period , reduction gait variability , important marker fall risk , improvement cognition , namely attention executive function</detailed_description>
