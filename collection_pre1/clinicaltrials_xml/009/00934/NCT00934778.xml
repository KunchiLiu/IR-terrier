	<brief_summary>We want compare 2 new system obtain detailed image small airway , hope use provide useful information lung diseases without need invasive test . Two new system develop use bronchoscope , provide video image small airway , system look different aspect structure airway wall . In principal , method could provide useful information may reduce need surgical lung biopsy . We therefore assess value additional information obtain two new system . The purpose research project gather information use system gain great understanding tissue characteristic various disease without need biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Endoscopy Diffuse Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse lung disease ( DLD ) remain challenging area diagnosis treatment . Features suggestive various histological subtypes DLD obtain clinical history examination , also see cross-sectional imaging ( high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) scan ) , however final diagnosis often rely result invasive test . The gold-standard diagnostic tool surgical lung biopsy , require general anaesthetic either thoracoscopy thoracotomy . The morbidity even mortality attach approach patient , many significant respiratory compromise , result less invasive technique employ many instance . At present , involve use bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) transbronchial biopsy via fibreoptic bronchoscope . BAL distress patient spill-over lavage fluid large airway , transbronchial biopsy lead significant bleeding pneumothorax around 5 % patient . Even biopsy BAL , patient still progress surgical lung biopsy . There recently develop 2 system use via work channel endoscope provide image distal airway alveoli vivo real time . These describe . In principal , could provide diagnostic information set DLD without need biopsy BAL , reduce morbidity cost associate sample processing , shorten time diagnosis . The ideal situation would sufficient morphological histological information could obtain use system , thus obviate altogether need surgical biopsy patient group , provide benefit patient potentially huge cost saving institution . Cellvizio® Lung ( Mauna Technology ) Confocal microscopy standard tool ultrahigh resolution image biomedical research . Mauna Technology develop 1.4mm diameter Alveoflex Confocal Miniprobe™ deploy work channel standard bronchoscope . Elastin main vivo fluorophore , image acquire gentle contact , provide microstructural detail alveolus multiple tissue layer . Because system take advantage natural fluorescence lung tissue , patient preparation require . Endocytoscope system ( ECS ) The endocytoscope newly develop system pass work channel standard bronchoscope , provide high magnification view ( x450 ) cell surface . About 5mls 0.5 % methylene blue solution use stain area interest , image obtain contact cell surface . Use ECS already show allow discrimination normal abnormal tissue situ set bronchial dysplasia malignancy . Aim research The purpose research project build database information gather use system feature correlate different diffuse lung disease ( e.g . sarcoidosis , interstitial pneumonia , drug induce lung disease , emphysema ) record . Patients normal lung parenchyma focal disease lung cancer also evaluate order develop well understand pulmonary morphology use technique . By use two potentially complimentary system look different structural aspect target tissue , great understand vivo tissue characteristic gain . It hop diagnostic criterion draw individual disease assess prospectively trial .</detailed_description>
