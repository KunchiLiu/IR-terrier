	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography Imaging 3-Deoxy-3'- [ 18F ] Fluorothymidine ( FLT ) selectively identify proliferate non-proliferating tissue , include tumor . FLT uptake tumor indirect marker DNA synthesis activity , target chemotherapy . Our hypothesis early change FLT uptake tumor chemotherapy predict pathological response neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer . Tumor uptake FLT image measure positron emission mammography ( PEM ) , PET scanner optimize breast imaging significantly improve resolution compare conventional whole-body PET image system .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 2 . Subject must histologically confirm breast cancer . 3 . Subject must schedule receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery standard cancer care . Treatment decision make treat surgeon medical oncologist . 4 . Females least 18 year age . 5 . Karnofsky least 60 % time screen . 6 . Life expectancy great 6 month . 7 . Subject must normal organ marrow function ( define ) within 30 day study enrollment : leukocyte least 3,000/microL absolute neutrophil count least 1,500/microL platelet least 100,000/microL total bilirubin Equal le 1.0 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) great 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) great 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine Equal le 1.4 mg/dl BUN Equal le 20 mg /dl 8 . The effect FLT develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A screening urine hCG administer Nuclear Medicine woman childbearing potential FLT scan pregnant woman accept subject study . 1 . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Subject Karnofsky score 60 . 3 . Pregnant woman exclude study . FLT PET potential teratogenic effect . Because potentially unknown risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FLT , breastfeed discontinue mother imaged FLT may resume 48 hour FLT image . 4 . Subjects take nucleoside analog medication use antiretroviral agent .</criteria>
