	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give liposomal cytarabine high-dose methotrexate work treat patient breast cancer spread central nervous system . Drugs use chemotherapy , liposomal cytarabine methotrexate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving liposomal cytarabine high-dose methotrexate may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Cytarabine High-Dose Methotrexate Treating Patients With Central Nervous System Metastases From Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To show treatment high-dose methotrexate ( HD-MTX ) combination intrathecal ( IT ) sustained-release cytarabine ( liposomal cytarabine ) result median progression-free survival ( PFS ) great 7 week patient breast cancer leptomeningeal metastasis without parenchymal brain involvement . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe overall survival patient central nervous system ( CNS ) metastatic breast cancer treat combination intravenous ( IV ) HD-MTX IT Depocyt ( liposomal cytarabine ) . II . To describe safety combination therapy , term toxicity , adverse event , need dose reduction schedule modification . III . To estimate best overall response rate achieve treatment IV HD-MTX IT Depocyt . Radiographic response measure Macdonald Criteria use imaging ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) , cytologic response measure cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cytology . IV . To determine number treatment cycle need achieve radiographic cytologic response . V. To describe response duration patient achieve least partial radiographic response cytologic clearance . VI . To define time clinical progression measure Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) neurological exam . VII . To describe functional status quality life patient , clinical evaluation neurological status patient-reported quality life ( QOL ) measure Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) brain and/or CNS questionnaire . VIII . To correlate response rate extent patient 's systemic disease tumor receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] , progesterone receptor [ PR ] , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ Her2 ] /neu and/or breast cancer , early onset [ BRCA ] applicable ) . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY ( WEEKS 1-6 ) : Patients liposomal cytarabine IT via lumbar puncture ( LP ) every 14 day begin week 1 . Patients also receive high-dose methotrexate IV every 14 day begin week 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY ( WEEKS 7-11 ) : Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) CSF negative malignant cell receive liposomal cytarabine IT via LP begin week 7 high-dose methotrexate IV begin week 8 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY ( WEEKS 13-37 ) : Patients achieve CR , PR , SD CSF negative malignant cell receive liposomal cytarabine IT via LP every 4 week begin week 13 high-dose methotrexate IV monthly begin week 15 . Treatment liposomal cytarabine repeat every 4 week 5 course treatment high-dose methotrexate repeat monthly 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
