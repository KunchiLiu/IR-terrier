	<brief_summary>Spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) group inherit disorder characterize cerebellar degeneration lead imbalance , incoordination , speech difficulty problem walk . Recently , individual case report suggest varenicline , drug use smoking cessation , produce substantial improvement patient several inherited ataxia . A modest response note 5 patient SCA , suggest potentially efficacious disorder well . Although agent available off-label use , severe side effect note use lack long-term toxicity data demand systematically assess . The present study test whether varenicline safe potentially efficacious heterogeneous cohort adult SCA .</brief_summary>
