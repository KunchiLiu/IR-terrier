	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) second deadly infectious disease HIV . Multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) emerge worldwide epidemic , limit treatment option . HIV infected people suppress immune system particularly susceptible TB , TB lead cause death among people HIV . Treating people infect HIV TB particularly problematic rifamycins , drug class usually use treat TB , low effectiveness certain anti-HIV medication . Studies pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , interaction drug body , need determine anti-TB anti-HIV medication safely effectively combine . This study examine TMC207 , new anti-TB medication potential shorten TB treatment time , combine efavirenz ( EFV ) , antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication use many first-line treatment regimen HIV . The study test PK safety combination healthy volunteer . Participation study last 49 day . At entry , participant complete basic assessment , include take medical history complete physical exam , eye exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measure heartbeat , pregnancy test , blood test . Certain behavior substance prohibit study , include consume grapefruit , alcohol , caffeine ( PK visit day ) ; take nutritional supplement , over-the-counter herbal medicine , certain medicine drug study ; excessive smoking . Participants also ask keep medication diary record medication take study . All participant receive study medication schedule : single dose TMC207 Days 1 29 , daily dose EFV Days 15 43 . Participants complete two PK visit , one Days 1 3 , one Days 28 31 . During PK visit , participant vital sign check undergo ECG , may also complete limited physical exam , give medication history , report symptom . They multiple blood sample take via catheter leave place 3-day visit . Blood sample take receive TMC207 ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 hour receive TMC207 ; morning Days 2 3 . Participants complete six outpatient visit 11 day follow PK visit one outpatient visit Day 21 , PK visit . At outpatient visit participant complete blood draw may complete limited physical exam medical history , record symptom , review medication diary . On Day 49 participant complete last study visit , repeat many assessment baseline test . In case side effect abnormal blood test , participant may monitor long safety reason .</detailed_description>
