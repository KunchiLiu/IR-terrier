	<brief_title>Collecting Tissue Samples From Patients With Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To maintain create University Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) Radiation Oncology Tissue Resource Registry/Database use explore genetic variation contribute clinical outcome tissue analysis outcome correlation . Tissue store UTSTR database manage Radiation Oncology . Secondary - To document disease outcome ( local recurrence , distant metastasis , overall survival ) treatment regimen disease site . - To document toxicity treatment regimen disease site . - To establish prospective registry/database consist patient demographic outcome used future research . OUTLINE : Tissue , include surgical waste , venous blood/serum , urine , bone marrow , body fluid , may collect ( plan surgery routine medical visit ) preserve future research . Demographic disease treatment information obtain patient ( interview questionnaire ) , medical record , national datasets . Patients may also ask provide additional blood sample and/or small skin-punch biopsy sample . Patients follow every 6 month first two year follow treatment yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
