	<brief_summary>The purpose research see certain tablet formulation factor affect oral drug absorption . Medications take mouth , tablet , need absorb body order good . Tablets contain drug , also contain non-drug ingredient call excipients filler . Excipients tablet , way tablet manufacture , impact much drug absorb body . That , tablet formulation factor cause tablet effective effective . Tablets research contain drug ciprofloxacin hydrochloride . Ciprofloxacin antibiotic treat infection , lung infection . This drug use since low water solubility probably sensitive tablet formulation factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dogs human exhibit difference gastrointestinal physiology . The development pharmaceutical human dog typically depend upon pharmacokinetic study specie . Product design quality attribute dog ( human ) generally conduct extrapolation simplistic fashion , without systematic account differential intestinal physiology dog human . This project aim elucidate product quality difference human dog oral solid dosage form result differential physiology two specifies . This insight facilitate regulation canine medicine highlight product standard human medicine either liberal restrictive canine medicine . Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride use model poorly soluble drug . A range immediate-release ( IR ) tablet formulate map design space . Formulations fast , medium , slow , respect dissolution rate drug . Ciprofloxacin expect exhibit formulation-dependent pharmacokinetics , additionally impacted differential physiology dog human . In particular , investigator anticipate great sensitivity formulation dog human . Consequently , investigator anticipate dog sensitive formulation , critical formulation factor must consider canine product design regulation . Objectives : 1 ) The primary objective human study ass whether specific formulation factor impact rate extent ciprofloxacin oral absorption , well absolute absorption profile ciprofloxacin . 2 ) The secondary objective assess dog exhibit great sensitivity formulation human . Hypotheses : The investigator anticipate human exhibit modest sensitivity specific tablet formulation factor . 1 ) Hence , hypothesis human study human exhibit sensitivity specific formulation factor show vitro - vivo correlation dissolution rate . 2 ) Alternative hypothesis human exhibit sensitivity specific formulation factor show vitro - vivo correlation dissolution rate .</detailed_description>
