	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer lead cause death intestinal tract cancer China.In case , high death rate due tumor spread beyond gastric cancer time diagnosis . In China , standard chemotherapy initial treatment gastric cancer combination platinum analogue 5-Fu.With modern surgical intervention contemporary chemotherapy , patient attain well clinical remission.The majority , however , eventually relapse die disease . The peritoneal cavity principal site disease gastric cancer.Although intensity intravenous chemotherapy limit mainly myelotoxicity , several active drug administer directly peritoneal cavity . The rationale intraperitoneal therapy gastric cancer peritoneum , predominant site tumor , receives sustain exposure high concentration antitumor agent normal tissue , bone marrow , relatively spar . The investigator conduct trial investigate efficacy safety intraperitoneal chemotherapy advance gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
