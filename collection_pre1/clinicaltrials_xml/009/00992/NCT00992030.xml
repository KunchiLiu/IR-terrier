	<detailed_description>Limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma highly curable disease , expect long-term disease-free overall survival rate close 90 % 95 % , respectively . This success come cost long-term treatment-related toxicity , patient live beyond 10 15 year likely die late complication treatment disease . In last decade effort improve long-term result make develop curative strategy aim reduce toxicity maintain high cure rate . Based observation systemic chemotherapy control occult sit disease , thereby eliminate requirement stag laparotomy , last year use combined modality allow reduction number cycle chemotherapy radiation field size dos , thus reduce late toxicity investigate various clinical trial . Combined modality therapy emerge standard care limited-stage Hodgkin 's lymphoma doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ( ABVD ) chemotherapy devoid alkylating agent associate low potential gonadal toxicity leukemogenesis , currently consider gold standard . Nevertheless , optimal treatment still question debate current investigation take consideration reduce long-term toxicity . Actually two main option available . The first option combine radiotherapy ABVD chemotherapy , aim maximize disease control . Using 4 cycle ABVD follow involved field radiotherapy 36 Gy , Bonadonna coworkers first document 94 % freedom-from-progression 94 % overall survival rate , respectively . The disadvantage approach represent late cardiovascular event ( myocardial dysfunction coronary valvular disease ) , especially heart within radiation field ; bleomycin pulmonary toxicity also increase conjunction RT secondary tumor , particular RT field . Whether risk low few chemotherapy cycle , low RT dos , study many clinical trial demonstrate small radiation field low dos important , key unanswered question whether RT eliminate completely limited-stage patient . The second option therefore consist chemotherapy ABVD alone , aim eliminate late effect radiotherapy . This approach result absolute increase failure rate order 8 % ( approximately 4 % 12 % ) . However , majority relapse patient achieve durable disease control second-line radiation-containing combine approach , show overall survival rate superimposable patient receive upfront combine strategy chemo-radiotherapy . We thus design study aim treat patient limited disease multiagent chemotherapy alone , without irradiation , use radiotherapy relapse . In fact , recently report addition Rituximab ( monoclonal antibody direct CD20 B-cell antigen ) ABVD significantly increase antilymphoma activity ABVD alone advanced-stage Hodgkin 's lymphoma absence add toxicity . In conclusion , rituximab-supplemented ABVD ( R-ABVD ) give early-stage Hodgkin 's lymphoma might represent radiation-free regimen capable increase long-term disease control ABVD alone , avoid late effect radiotherapy . The primary objective study evaluate whether R-ABVD therapy ( ARM A ) bad standard therapy ABVD-RT ( ARM B ) patient limit Hodgkin 's lymphoma . In trial maximum inferiority 8 % 3-year Failure Free Survival rate ( FFS ) ARM A respect ARM B consider acceptable assess ARM A worse ARM B .</detailed_description>
