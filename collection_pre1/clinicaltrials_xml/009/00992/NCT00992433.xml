	<brief_summary>The purpose study see body reacts different strength H1N1 flu shot person infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . This study also compare CD4 count ( cell help fight disease ) affect body 's response H1N1 flu shot . In study , 2 strength H1N1 flu shot give twice , 3 week apart . The result study help researcher find different strength H1N1 flu shot make body produce H1N1 antibody well fight H1N1 flu . About 240 HIV positive subject , age 18-64 year , ask take part study . Study procedures include : blood sampling , physical exam , use memory aid record temperature , medication symptom . The length patient participation 7 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>H1N1 Vaccine Two Dose Levels HIV Positive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . The immunosuppression associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infection relate diminish immune response vaccination multiple pathogen , include influenza . The widespread use antiretroviral therapy result significant decrease mortality HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , result , HIV-infected subject constitute demographically grow subpopulation United States . Currently , novel H1N1 vaccine evaluate general population . Researchers propose evaluate safety immunogenicity novel H1N1 vaccine HIV-infected subject , data clinical trial enrol healthy subject may apply immunosuppressed individual ; evaluation immune response vaccination new , pandemic influenza virus never perform HIV-infected subject . This randomized , open label , Phase II study HIV seropositive male non-pregnant female , age 18-64 year . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine 2 dose level . Subjects randomize 2 dose group , stratify cluster differentiation ( CD4 ) cell count enrollment ( 120 subject per dose group 60 subject per CD4 cell count stratum , &lt; 200/mL great equal 200/mL ) receive intramuscular ( IM ) inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 1 ) 30 mcg ( Group 2 ) . The H1N1 vaccine administer Day 0 Day 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive dos Day 21 receive second dose ) , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month post first vaccination ( Day 201 ) , reactogenicity vaccine 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . A CD4/CD8 panel viral load measure prior first vaccination Day 0 Day 10 post second vaccination . Immunogenicity test include hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody test serum obtain day vaccination ( prior vaccination ) , Day 10 vaccination , 21 day follow second vaccination ( Day 42 ) 6 month second vaccination ( Day 201 ) . The primary objective study : ( safety ) , assess safety unadjuvanted , inactivated H1N1 vaccine HIV-1 seropositive adult administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose ( immunogenicity ) ass antibody response follow 1 2 dos inactivate H1N1 vaccine administer intramuscularly 15 mcg 30 mcg dose level HIV-1 seropositive adult stratify CD4 count enrollment .</detailed_description>
