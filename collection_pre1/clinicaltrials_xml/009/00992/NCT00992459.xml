	<detailed_description>This randomize , active-controlled , double-blind , cross-over study design enroll subject UCDs treat NaPBA . Subjects randomly assign receive either HPN-100 + NaPBA placebo NaPBA + HPN 100 placebo 2 week , cross receive treatment 2 week . Venous ammonia primary outcome measure . Subjects admit clinical research unit 24 hour pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood urine sampling ( include overnight stay ) end treatment period , time study drug reach steady state . Subjects follow stable diet throughout study prescribe investigator dietician . Throughout study , diet diary complete subject dietary protein intake assess dietician base complete dietary diary consultation subject . Subjects complete study meet study entry criterion , offer opportunity enroll HPN-100 open-label safety protocol ( HPN-100-007 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis UCD ( Urea Cycle Disorder ) involve deficiency Carbamyl phosphate synthetase ( CPS ) , Ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC ) , Arginosuccinate ( ASS ) , confirm via enzymatic , biochemical , genetic test Adult UCD subject 18 year age older treat Buphenyl/Sodium phenylbuterate ( NaPBA ) UCD ; subject must stable dose NaPBA least 1 week prior Day 1 visit . Subjects receive NaPBA initial screen visit , potential benefit treatment , may start receive NaPBA screen period enrol long stable dose NaPBA least 1 week prior Day 1 . No clinical evidence hyperammonemia associate ammonia level ≥ 100 μmol/L 2 week precede screening Signed informed consent subject Able perform comply study activity , include blood draw 24hour urine sample Negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential All female childbearing age sexually active male must agree use acceptable method contraception throughout study . Appropriate contraceptive method include hormonal contraceptive ( oral , injected , implanted , transdermal ) , tubal ligation , intrauterine device , hysterectomy , vasectomy , double barrier method . Abstinence acceptable form birth control , though appropriate contraception must use subject becomes sexually active . Screening baseline ammonia level ≥ 100 μmol/L sign symptom indicative hyperammonemia 2week period precede screening enrollment ; subject may rescreened ammonia control stable least 14 day , discretion investigator Use investigational drug within 30 day Day 1 Active infection ( viral bacterial ) intercurrent condition ( apart UCD ) may increase ammonia level Any clinical laboratory abnormality Grade 3 great severity accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v3.0 , except Grade 3 elevation liver enzymes , define level 520 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST/SGOT ) , gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) clinically stable subject Any clinical laboratory abnormality medical condition , discretion investigator , may put subject increase risk participate study Use medication know significantly affect renal clearance ( e.g. , probenecid ) increase protein catabolism ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) , medication know increase ammonia level ( e.g. , valproate ) , within 24 hour prior Day 1 throughout study Use sodium benzoate within one week Day 1 History correct QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation QTc interval &gt; 450 msec screen baseline Known hypersensitivity phenylacetate ( PAA ) phenylbutyrate ( PBA ) Liver transplant , include hepatocellular transplant Breastfeeding lactating female</criteria>
