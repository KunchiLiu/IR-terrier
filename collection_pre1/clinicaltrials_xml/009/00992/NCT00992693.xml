	<brief_title>Treatment Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers With Intravenous Ribavirin Military Treatment Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Department Defense operation result deployment personnel area endemic Viral Hemorrhagic Fever ( VHF ) : Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever ( CCHF ) Lassa Fever . Unfortunately , beyond supportive care , approve therapy treat either infection . Previous study intravenous ( IV ) Ribavirin show IV Ribavirin promise treatment infection . This study provide experience U.S. Department Defense associate treatment facility use IV Ribavirin experimental treatment viral hemorrhagic fever primarily among U.S. Service personnel deploy disease-endemic area . The rationale conduct study ) allow DoD gain experience treat VHF b ) offer experimental promising therapy patient probable suspected VHF c ) collect safety data obtain experience use Ribavirin .</detailed_description>

Agrees followup visit donate blood urine specimen day 14 ( Â±2 day ) day 28 60 first dose IV Ribavirin followup visit anemia medical condition require attend physician . Woman childbearing age must pregnancy test perform . If negative , must agree become pregnant treatment 7 month receive Ribavirin . She also must agree breast feed treatment 7 month receive Ribavirin . Two reliable form effective contraception must use include one barrier method treatment 7 month posttreatment period .
