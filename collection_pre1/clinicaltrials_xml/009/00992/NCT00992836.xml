	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response H1N1 Influenza Virus Vaccine HIV Infected Children Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new H1N1 influenza virus see 2009 designated pandemic World Health Organization , due sustain community outbreak see United States Mexico . Based preliminary data , appear child young adult particularly risk H1N1 virus . People infect HIV also susceptible severe influenza infection uninfected . Children HIV infection , , compound risk H1N1 infection . Higher dos influenza vaccine associate development high level serum antibody , need resist infection . Higher vaccine dos use improve vaccine effectiveness at-risk population . This study test safety immune response HIV infect child youth high dose vaccine new H1N1 influenza virus . Participation study last 7 month two step . The first step involve receive first dose H1N1 virus vaccine , second step , occur 21 day later , involve receive second dose vaccine . Each dose vaccine deliver via two intramuscular shot ( four total injection ) . After receive dose vaccine , participant give diary record symptom reaction . Participants stratify three group age , include 4 9 year , 9 18 year , 18 25 year . Participants complete five schedule visit , take place screening , study entry , Days 21 31 , 7 month . Measurements take visit include medical history , physical neurological exam , blood draw , , applicable , pregnancy test .
