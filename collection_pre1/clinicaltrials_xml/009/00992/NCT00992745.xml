	<brief_summary>This open-label study compare image characteristic 123-I-MIP-1072 ProstaScint® ( 111-In-capromab pendetide ) patient metastatic prostate cancer . Eligible patient receive dose 123-I-MIP-1072 imaging study safety assessment ( physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory test ) perform subsequent 24 hour . Two week later , patient return additional safety assessment receive ProstaScint® n't already pre-existing ProstaScint scan . Final assessment perform two week ProstaScint® scan unless difference 123-I-MIP-1072 ProstaScint® scan . If case , another dose 123-I-MIP-1072 give 12 week later , image study repeat .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow criterion enrol study . 1 . Male age 18 year old 2 . Signed write informed consent willingness comply protocol requirement 3 . Histologic diagnosis prostate cancer validate history and/or biopsy prostate metastatic lesion . 4 . Evidence metastatic disease document abnormal bone scan CT scan MRI plus : Castration/anti androgen therapy naïve/sensitive : 1 . Gleason Score ≥ 7 PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL history prostatectomy primary radiation therapy prostate gland prior undetectable PSA ; PSA &gt; 10.0 ng/mL intact prostate , 2 . Gleason score ≤ 6 PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL , 3 . Gleason Score ≥ 8 double PSA , PSA &gt; 0.5 ng/mL , 4 . Clinical Stage 3 Gleason Score ≥ 8 If anti androgen therapy , must initiate therapy least 4 week prior treatment . Castration/anti androgen therapy resistant : 1 . Patients must current historical evidence disease progression concomitant surgical ( orchiectomy ) medical castration ( LHRH analogue ) ; anti androgen withdrawal ( 4 week flutamide 6 week nilutamide bicalutamide ) necessary patient anti androgen demonstrate &gt; 3 month duration beneficial response anti androgens ; progression demonstrate follow : I. PSA progression : 2 serial rise PSA determination least 14 day apart PSA nadir , last measurement ≥ 2 ng/mL II . Progression measurable disease , progression non measurable disease define : . Soft tissue disease : The appearance one new lesion , and/or unequivocal worsen non measurable disease compare imaging study acquire castration therapy precastration study response , ii . Bone disease : Appearance two new area abnormal uptake bone scan compare image study acquire castration therapy pre castration study response . III . Increased uptake pre exist lesion bone scan constitute progression . IV . Testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL achieve via medical surgical castration . 5 . Male subject fertile agree use acceptable form birth control , define abstinence , barrier acceptable , effective contraceptive method throughout study period . A second form barrier birth control must utilize subject 's partner use oral contraception least seven day last injection . 6 . Karnofsky performance ≥ 50 7 . Adequate hematologic , renal liver function : WBC ≥ 2.0×103/mm3 ( ANC &gt; 1.0 x 103 mm3 ) Platelet count ≥ 75×103/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2x ULN AST , ALT ≤ 5x ULN 1 . Karnofsky performance status &lt; 50 2 . Subject receive permanent prostate brachytherapy implant within last 3 month 103Pd implant 12 month 125I implant 3 . Subject administer diagnostic radioisotope within 5 physical half live radioisotope prior study enrollment 4 . Subject receive investigational compound and/or medical device part investigational study within past 30 day enrollment study 5 . Any treatment radiopharmaceutical , e.g . Strontium 89 Samarium 153 within 6 month prior enrollment 6 . Ketoconazole anti androgen ( flutamide , nilutamide , bicalutamide ) within 4 week prior enrollment . Patients demonstrate antiandrogen withdrawal response , define &gt; 25 % drop PSA within 4 week ( flutamide ) 6 week ( nilutamide , bicalutamide ) stop non steroidal anti androgen , eligible PSA rise nadir observe anti androgen withdrawal 7 . Initiation bisphosphonate therapy within 28 day prior enrollment . Patients take bisphosphonates dose regimen alter unless medically warrant interval baseline scan end study 8 . Subject medical condition circumstance , opinion Investigator , would significantly decrease chance obtain reliable data , achieve study objective , complete study and/or post dose follow examination 9 . Subject determine Investigator clinically unsuitable study 10 . If subject malignancy within past year , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , diagnosis location must define define clinically control treat complete response</criteria>
