	<brief_title>An Open-Label Pharmacodynamic Study Bevacivumab Pazopanib Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , two-part , open-label study design evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect bevacizumab pazopanib subject renal cancer experience disease progression follow least one prior therapy document clinical benefit . In Part I , subject receive 3 infusion 10 mg/kg bevacizumab , administer 2-week interval . The PD response bevacizumab evaluate 6 week use image technique ( magnetic resonance imaging ; compute tomography [ CT ] ; positron emission tomography ) , intratumoural VEGF signal immunohistochemisty , plasma serum biomarkers , circulate tumour cell . Subjects may continue Part II , opinion investigator , subject would derive continued clinical benefit anti-angiogenic therapy . In Part II , subject receive sequentially escalate dos oral pazopanib 3-week cycle follow : 1 ) 200 mg twice weekly , 2 ) 200 mg every day , 3 ) 200 mg daily , 4 ) 400 mg daily , 5 ) 800 mg daily , 6 ) 1200 mg daily . Subjects enter Part II randomise receive treatment either throughout 3-week cycle ( Group 1 ) first 2 week cycle , follow 1 week treatment holiday ( Group 2 ) . After completion Part II dose escalation subject receive continuous pazopanib dose 800 mg daily repeat 3-week cycle . These subject receive pazopanib loss clinical benefit , death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal study reason .</detailed_description>
