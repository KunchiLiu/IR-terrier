	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Pregnant woman increase risk serious consequence influenza infection . A 15 microgram ( mcg ) dose unadjuvanted inactivated H1N1 vaccine recommend healthy adult recent preliminary data indicate dose likely protective pregnant woman . However , high dose unadjuvanted , inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine may necessary confer optimal protection risk population . This protocol explore antibody response follow vaccination pregnant woman 2 different dose level ( 15 mcg 30 mcg ) non-pregnant control group receive 15 mcg dose . Antibody response assess 21 day 180 day post vaccination . For pregnant woman , maternal cord blood collect determine level H1N1 antibody transfer baby . An optimal immune response pregnant woman would impact transplacental transport protective antibody important since vaccine available infant young six month , another risk population severe H1N1 disease . Sustained immunity least 6 month post-vaccination would impart benefit woman also decrease primary exposure risk ( infected mother ) newborn infant . Furthermore , systematic evaluation kinetics maternally transfer antibody 2009 H1N1 influenza virus help improve develop strategy protect infant influenza . This open label , Phase II study pregnant non-pregnant woman , age 18-39 year old design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine . Pregnant woman randomize 2 group ( 100 per dose group ) receive intramuscular ( IM ) inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 1 ) 30 mcg ( Group 2 ) . A non-pregnant control group 100 subject receive IM inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 3 ) . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event ( AEs ) 21 day post vaccination ( serious AEs new-onset chronic medical condition monthly 6 month post vaccination ( Day 180 ) . Reactogenicity vaccine assess 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody test serum obtain Days 0 , 21 , 180 . For pregnant group , HAI antibody test also perform serum participant delivery , serum cord blood collect delivery , possible , serum sample collect participant day 180 infant 6 week , four month , six month delivery . The primary safety objective ass safety unadjuvanted , inactivate H1N1 influenza vaccine pregnant woman administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose . The primary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response unadjuvanted , inactivate H1N1 influenza vaccine pregnant woman administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose . The secondary objective pregnant woman assess efficiency placental transport maternal influenza antigen specific antibody neonate .</detailed_description>
