	<brief_summary>SYSDIET ( Systems biology control dietary intervention cohort study ) one three centre NCoE Food , Nutrition Health , 2007-2011 . It consist 12 partner five Nordic country work multidisciplinary field science relate nutritional biology . The main objective SYSDIET reveal mechanism Nordic food diet could modify promote health prevent insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease , connect metabolic syndrome . Furthermore , aim build Nordic platform cohort study carefully conduct multi-centre dietary intervention study , novel nutritional system biology tool apply besides human study also animal cell culture study . In order achieve main objective Nordic multi-centre randomize control human intervention study conduct 2009-2010 6-8 centre SYSDIET consortium . Health Nordic population substantially improve last 30 year . This due e.g . marked decline cardiovascular morbidity mortality . However , last 10-20 year increase obesity sedentary lifestyle result increase metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes . Having background , aim SYSDIET consortium carry control , randomize dietary intervention study person feature metabolic syndrome find effect healthy Nordic food major abnormality metabolic syndrome . Altogether 167 person age 30 65 year recruit 6-8 center ( 40-60 subjects/center ) SYSDIET cohort . The main inclusion criterion BMI 27-38 kg/m2 . The subject also least two IDF criterion metabolic syndrome . Recruited person start study follow conventional diet one month run-in period . After subject randomly assign Experimental- Control-diet-group 6 month . Experimental diet rich whole grain product , berry , fruit , vegetable fish , fat intake modify accord current Nordic recommendation . Control diet base current information mean dietary intake food consumption . The diet realize accord eat habit Nordic country .</brief_summary>
