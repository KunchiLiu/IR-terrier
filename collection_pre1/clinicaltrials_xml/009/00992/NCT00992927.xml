	<brief_title>Should Joint Capsule Painful Stiff Shoulder Ruptured During Intra-articular Hydraulic Distension ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Painful stiff shoulder ( PSS ) , adhesive capsulitis , involve stiff contract joint capsule fibrosis glenohumeral joint . Intra-articular hydraulic distension ( IHD ) enlarge stiffen capsule deform excessive volume pressure within joint space . Although IHD one common treatment option PSS , diversity IHD technique span wide range . Specifically , generally agree , capsule-rupturing capsule-preserving IHDs , superior PSS treatment . Capsule-preserving IHD might fail infuse sufficient amount fluid avoid rupture , thus produce less satisfactory outcome . However , devise previous study novel technique enable physician infuse possible large volume without rupture capsule . By employ technique , aim compare clinical efficacy capsule-rupturing versus capsule-preserving IHDs patient PSSs .</detailed_description>
