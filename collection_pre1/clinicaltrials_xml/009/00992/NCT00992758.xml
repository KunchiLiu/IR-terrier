	<brief_summary>This phase I , dose escalation , open-label , multicenter study iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) 25 % bone marrow involvement NHL . Prior study Iodine-131 Anti B1 Antibody treatment NHL exclude patient 25 % bone marrow involvement NHL . To eligible , patient must previously treat fail achieve objective response relapse follow last treatment . Patients undergo two dose phase study . In first phase , term `` dosimetric dose '' , patient receive 450 mg unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody infuse 1 hour long follow 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody 1-2 mg label 5 mCi Iodine-131 infuse 20 minute . Whole body camera scan obtain Day 0 , Day 2 , 3 , 4 , Day 6 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data three image time point , patient-specific dose Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody deliver desired total body dose radiotherapy calculate . In second phase , term `` therapeutic dose '' , 450 mg Anti-B1 Antibody infuse 1 hour long follow 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody label subject-specific dose Iodine-131 deliver desire total body radiation , infuse 20 minute . The dose escalation initiate 45 cGy increase 10 cGy increment maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . Patients treat either saturated potassium iodide , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior infusion dosimetric dose continue 14 day follow last infusion therapeutic dose . The primary endpoint determine maximum tolerate dose Iodine-131 Anti B-1 Antibody patient previously treat NHL 25 % bone marrow involvement lymphoma . Secondary endpoint include assessment response rate , duration response , relapse-free survival , time treatment failure , safety , survival .</brief_summary>
