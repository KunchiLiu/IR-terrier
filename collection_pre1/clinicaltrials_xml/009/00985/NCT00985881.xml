	<brief_title>Use Subtle Vibration Improve Walking Ability Lower Limb Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One many complication diabetes loss sensation foot . This sensory deficit negatively impact postural stability mobility non-amputees , since without feedback , simply difficult stand walk . For low limb amputee , problem compound . These patient often difficulty prosthetic limb placement maneuver task , exhibit dramatic increase movement center pressure quiet standing , clinical observational gait analysis reveal significant change gait pattern relative non-amputees . The investigator ' work proposes explore use novel prosthetic intervention diabetic low limb amputee . The investigator hypothesize intervention sufficiently enhance proprioception result measurably improve postural stability locomotor function patient . The intervention base phenomenon know stochastic resonance , whereby application sub-threshold vibration enable mechano-receptors previously unable respond stimuli become susceptible depolarization . For Veterans neuropathic proprioceptive loss , stochastic resonance may facilitate functional response subtle stimuli gross input formerly require .</detailed_description>
