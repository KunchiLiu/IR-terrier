	<brief_summary>Amputee gait produce periodic occlusion residual limb blood vessel . During stance phase gait , body weight cause prosthesis compress soft tissue residual limb occlude blood flow . This occlusion relieve swing phase , may depend type prosthesis . The purpose propose research : ( 1 ) discover range tissue oxygenation intact residual low limb dysvascular amputee gait ( 2 ) learn five different prosthetic limb system provide great tissue oxygenation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Different Prosthetic Sockets Effect How Much Oxygen Tissue Lower Limb Amputees While They Are Walking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount oxygen residual limb tissue important health status indicator ; resistance infection , promotion wound healing , production collagen , epithelialization correlate high oxygen level . Unfortunately , simply don low limb prosthesis may limit circulation reduce level tissue oxygenation . This reduction may compound biomechanical force gait . The compressive load body 's weight stance inertial load prosthesis swing may occlude circulation , albeit different mechanism . For dysvascular low limb amputee , choice prosthetic socket suspension system may impact overall health residual limb wound heal capacity . An inappropriate choice may lead skin irritation , tissue breakdown , discomfort , reduce mobility . For patient , component reduces tissue oxygenation significant problem compromise circulation forestall wound heal . The objective propose research use photo-oximetry discover five different prosthetic limb system result higher residual limb tissue oxygenation rest gait . This experiment enable evidence-based decision make clinically relevant problem . Using prospective , randomized cross-over experimental design investigator ' photo-oximetry system , investigator measure compare tissue oxygenation along medial lateral surface ( 3 site ) residual limb rest walking .</detailed_description>
