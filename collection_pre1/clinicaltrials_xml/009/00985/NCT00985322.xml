	<brief_summary>Background : Angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor specific cardioprotective effect , compare treatment directly interfere renin-angiotensin-system ( RAS ) , significantly reduce cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality morbidity subject normal renal function . Despite CV event lead cause death patient , adequately power trial far evaluate specific cardioprotective effect ACE inhibitor population . Objectives : This prospective , randomize , open label , blind end point ( PROBE ) trial primarily aim evaluate whether , comparable blood pressure ( BP ) control , ACE inhibitor compare non-RAS inhibitor therapy significantly reduce incidence composite end point CV death ( include sudden death ) non-fatal myocardial infarction stroke 624 patient arterial hypertension ( pre-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg post-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP &gt; 130/80 mmHg antihypertensive therapy ) and/or echocardiography evidence LVH ( cardiac mass index &gt; 130 g/m2 men 100 g/m2 woman ) dialysis therapy since least six month . Secondarily , study compare incidence single component primary outcome , new onset paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation , thrombosis artero-venous fistula , new onset , progression regression LVH , change component metabolic syndrome , safety profile two treatment regimen cost/effectiveness . Methods : After 1 month wash-out period previous RAS inhibitor therapy baseline evaluation main clinical laboratory parameter , patient randomize 1:1 basis 2-year treatment ACE inhibitor BP lower regiment include RAS inhibitor . A balanced distribution accord centre , number dialysis session per week ( 2 3 ) , presence diabetes ( YES/NO ) , arterial hypertension ( YES/NO ) , LVH ( YES/NO ) achieve minimization method . Treatment adjust achieve maintain target BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg ( pre-dialysis ) target BP &lt; 130/80 mmHg ( post-dialysis ) group . Expected result : ACE inhibitor compare non-RAS inhibitor therapy expect reduce effectively fatal non-fatal CV event , prevent limit progression induce regression LVH , improve component metabolic syndrome , reduce treatment cost cardiovascular complication . These finding might help achieve effective cardioprotection people chronic dialysis lower cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor broader effect drug cardiovascular medicine , reduce risk death , myocardial infarction , stroke , diabetes , renal impairment.A recent meta-analysis 33,500 patient include six randomized clinical trial pool analysis Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ( HOPE ) , European Trial Reduction Cardiac Events Perindopril Stable Coronary Artery Disease ( EUROPA , Prevention Events Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibition ( PEACE ) trial show ACE inhibitor reduce mortality cardiovascular event also subject coronary artery disease preserve leave ventricular function . However , study exclude patient advanced renal insufficiency end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Thus , whether ACE inhibitor may specific cardioprotective effect also typology patient still matter investigation . This issue major clinical relevance since CV disease primary cause morbidity mortality ESRD population affect many 50-60 % ESRD patients.The burden CV disease population predict dramatically increase next year rapidly increase number patient require renal replacement therapy increase prevalence ESRD patient increase cardiovascular risk old age , diabetes hypertension . Despite excess CV risk , consistent proportion ESRD patient give ACE inhibitor therapy concern hyperkalemia . Others , contrary , treated basis result available trial . However , whether data subject without renal insufficiency generalize also ESRD unknown . This itchy point since dialysis patient might respond differently therapy prove benefit non-ESRD patient . For instance , data German Diabetes Dialysis study show , unlike general population , HmGCoA inhibitor therapy fail decrease CV mortality hemodialysis population . Thus , ad hoc study ESRD population urgently need . A recent trial , Fosinopril Dialysis ( FOSIDIAL ) study , try address issue , clearly underpowered result inconclusive . However , evidence non significant trend less cardiovascular event ACE inhibitor arm , suggest ACE inhibitor might specific cardioprotective effect also population . Thus , whether ACE inhibitor therapy effectively non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduce CV morbidity high risk patient chronic dialysis therapy worth investigate adequately power trial . Aims The broad aim study evaluate whether ACE inhibitor therapy reduce CV mortality morbidity high-risk ESRD patient arterial hypertension and/or LVH chronic hemodialysis therapy since &gt; 6 month . Primary : - To assess whether , comparable BP control , ACE inhibitor compare non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduce incidence combine end-point CV death ( include sudden cardiac death cardiac arrest resuscitation ) myocardial infarction non-fatal stroke . Secondary : - To compare incidence single component combine end-point , myocardial peripheral revascularizations , new onset atrial fibrillation one three form ( paroxysmal , persistent permanent ) recurrence arrhythmia patient experience paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation previously , hospitalization chronic heart failure thrombosis artero-venous fistula . - To evaluate whether ACE inhibitor prevent , limit progression achieve regression LVH ameliorate component metabolic syndrome whether effect correlate CV outcomes . - To compare cost/effectiveness two treatment . Safety : - Serious ( include disturbance cardiac rhythm electrical conduction possibly related hyperkalemia ) non-serious adverse event . - Any clinical laboratory abnormality -such symptomatic hypotension , cough , hyperkalemia ( serum potassium &gt; 6 mEq/L ) , anemia require increase dos erythropoietin- possibly related ACE inhibitor therapy . Design : This prospective , randomize , open label , blind end point ( PROBE ) trial include 624 hypertensive ESRD patient echocardiography evidence LVH chronic hemodialysis since &gt; 6 month . After 1 month wash-out period previous RAS inhibitor therapy stratification diabetes YES/NO , baseline evaluation main clinical laboratory parameter randomize 2-year treatment ACE inhibitor BP lower regimen include RAS inhibitor . Treatment adjust achieve maintain target BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg ( pre-dialysis ) target BP &lt; 130/80 mmHg ( post-dialysis ) group .</detailed_description>
