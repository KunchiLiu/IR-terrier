	<brief_title>Phase 2 Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy ( TSEBT 12 Gy ) Stage IB-IIIA Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total skin electron beam therapy administer Department Radiation Oncology accord Stanford six-field technique . Patients receive plan total skin dose 12 Gy fractionate 2 Gy/cycle ( cycle require 2 day treatment ) 4 day week , 3 week . Supplements routinely apply perineum sol well `` shadow '' sit involved disease , inframammary region ( 1-2 Gy fraction total dose 12 Gy ) . Discrete tumor may receive additional `` boost '' treatment exceed 12 Gy . During course TSEBT patient evaluate weekly Department Radiation Oncology determination adverse event toxicity grade accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) Version 3.0 . A baseline evaluation occur first day TSEBT time follow procedure perform : ( This visit may waive TSEBT initiate within one week screen visit AND clinical evidence disease progression ) . After completion TSEBT , patient follow every 4 week 24 week , every 8 week total 12 month disease progression , relapse , initiation new anti-cancer therapy . Patients withdraw treatment period due intolerance radiotherapy follow weekly toxicity revert Grade â‰¤ 2 stabilize opinion Investigator , point final visit schedule .
