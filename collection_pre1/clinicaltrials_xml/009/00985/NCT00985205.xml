	<brief_summary>The purpose study test follow hypothesis : 1 . Enteral glutamine administration decrease in-hospital mortality adult subject severe thermal burn injury . 2 . Enteral glutamine administration decrease infectious morbidity shorten length care adult subject severe thermal burn injury . 3 . Enteral glutamine administration decrease cost care adult subject severe thermal burn injury . The objective propose pilot trial relate evaluate feasibility study protocol . Specifically , investigator want ass follow outcome sample 200 patient 8 site : 1 . Number patient enrol per site per month reason non-enrollment . 2 . Rate consent eligible patient . 3 . Rate adherence study intervention reason non-adherence</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enteral glutamine find decrease mortality critically ill patient blood infection trauma patient . In pilot study ( Critical Care Medicine , 2003 , 31:2444 ) find protective effect glutamine blood infection severely burn adult patient . In addition , significant decrease mortality observe glutamine . These result test multi-center trial study small mortality end point . Since large multi center study never conduct burn patient , pilot study test feasibility seem warrant . The mechanism action glutamine controversial . Improvement T cell immune function , anti-oxidant property newly discover action heat shock protein could involve . If clinical hypothesis support result trial , additional grant proposal make test several mechanistic hypothesis , use blood sample obtain randomly determine sub-group patient stratified severity injury . The specific aim pilot study determine recruitment rate , compliance nutritional burn management protocol study intervention . Clinical outcome : mortality , incidence infectious episode , clinical status ICU stay length care adult severe burn . The study multi-center , prospective , double blind , control randomised clinical trial . Randomization conceal stratified burn severity . Patients adult , minimum 18 year old , admit within 48h post burn , deep 2nd and/or 3rd degree burn require grafting , patient age 18 - 59 year ( Total Burn Surface Area ) TBSA ≥ 20 % presence inhalation injury minimum 15 % TBSA require ; patient age 60 year old TBSA ≥ 10 % require . The pilot study include approximately 8 burn center , 2 Canada 6 US enrol 200 patient four year . These patient include final analysis complete trial . Compliance study protocol study intervention assess regular site visit , regular phone contact teleconference . Glutamine placebo give every 6 hour 0.5 gm/kg/day bolus orally , 7 day post last successful graft , discharge burn unit , 6 month ICU admission , whatever come first . Resuscitation , nutritional support , pain management , infection control surgical care do accord standardized procedure . Participating site choose collect lab mechanistic study collect approximately 30 ml ( 2 Tablespoons ) blood day 4 , 7 , 14 21 test effect glutamine inflammatory response time-course inflammation , immunosuppression production heat shock protein Samples draw CPT tube white blood cell isolation . The end point study : Primary : Recruitment rate , Compliance study protocol compliance study intervention . Secondary : mortality , incidence infectious episode , ICU length care , length care , multiple organ function . The cost-effectiveness glutamine administration also measure result show decrease length care reduce incidence infection glutamine . These outcome measure analysed pilot trial . The Data collect manage professional centralized organization multi centre clinical research ( Clinical Evaluation Research Unit , Kingston , Ontario , Canada ) .</detailed_description>
