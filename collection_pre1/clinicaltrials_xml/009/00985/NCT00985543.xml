	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Lopinavir/Ritonavir Three Different Doses .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data development lopinavir/ritonavir show low drug dos similar efficacy standard dose 400/100mg twice daily . Lower drug dos also associate limited toxicity cost . The purpose study ass pharmacokinetics plasma lopinavir/ritonavir follow administration male female HIV−negative volunteer 400/100mg , 200/150mg 200/50mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily . Each dose phase last 7 day phase separate 7-day wash-out period . Pharmacokinetic evaluation make 12-hour interval end dose phase . Healthy subject determine medical history physical examination eligible participate study . HIV−positive subject recruit risk HIV−resistant mutation select experimentally reduce dose lopinavir/ritonavir . There reason presume meaningful difference metabolic processing lopinavir/ritonavir HIV−infected HIV−uninfected people .</detailed_description>
