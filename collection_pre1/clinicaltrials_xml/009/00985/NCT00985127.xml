	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Urate-Lowering Activity Safety Oral BCX4208 Administered Subjects With Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind study evaluate efficacy safety BCX4208 approximately 120 subject gout . The study conduct 2 part . Part 1 parallel-group design , evaluate dos BCX4208 previously find safe well-tolerated healthy subject subject psoriasis . Part 2 dose-escalation study , evaluate high dos BCX4208 support nonclinical safety dossier . Part 2 initiate review efficacy safety data Part 1 , determination high dos BCX4208 may necessary achieve meaningful clinical activity . In Part 1 , approximately 60 subject randomize 1:1:1:1 fashion one follow 4 treatment group : 1 ) Placebo ; 2 ) 40 mg BCX4208 ; 3 ) 80 mg BCX4208 ; 4 ) 120 mg BCX4208 . In Part 1 , study consist 3 period : Screening Period , Treatment Period , Follow-Up Period . The Screening period begin Day -30 subject receive urate-lowering therapy ; subject discontinue urate-lowering therapy Day -30 allow appropriate washout period enter Treatment Period . For subject receive urate-lowering therapy , Screening Period may begin day Day -30 Day -1 ( Day -1 day immediately prior dose ) , long inclusion exclusion criterion satisfy . Some Screening procedure record medical history clinical laboratory test ( perform Screening ) may perform time Screening Period ( Day -30 Day -1 ) . Other Screening procedure must perform within 6 day prior first dose study drug ( i.e. , Day -6 Day -1 ) ; include : physical examination , height , weight , clinical chemistry ( include baseline qualify sUA ) , hematology , urinalysis evaluation , CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , CD56+ lymphocyte count , serum pregnancy test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign assessment . These assessment constitute Baseline assessment purpose comparison assessment post-dose . A recording concomitant medication adverse event ( AEs ) take place time signing Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) throughout duration study . The Treatment Period begin Day 1 . Subjects arrive study clinic Day 1 overnight fast . After final review eligibility criterion , pre-dose vital sign assessment , pre-dose BCX4208 pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood draw perform , subject randomize administer first dose study drug . Subjects remain study clinic Hour 2 , Hour 4 , Hour 8 assessment return study clinic efficacy safety evaluation Days 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Subjects take study drug daily Day 1 Day 21 , Day 22 evaluation occur approximately 24 hour last dose study drug . After Day 22 evaluation , subject enter Follow-Up Period return study clinic Days 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 safety evaluation . Subjects Day 50 unresolved treatment-emergent AEs follow beyond Day 50 either resolution AE Day 80 , whichever occur sooner . Subjects Day 50 absolute CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , and/or CD56+ lymphocyte count low limit normal &lt; 50 % Baseline follow monthly sooner : 1 ) return absolute CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , and/or CD56+ lymphocyte count low limit normal range , 2 ) 6 month Day 50 Early Termination Visit . All subject conclude study participation Day 50 Early Termination Visit . Efficacy assess study mean sUA concentration . Safety assess study mean physical examination , weight , clinical chemistry , hematology , urinalysis parameter , absolute CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , CD56+ lymphocyte count , 12-lead ECG , vital sign assessment , AE assessment . Efficacy , safety , tolerability data Part 1 study review prior initiation Part 2 . Part 2 consist 3 cohort : 1 ) 160 mg BCX4208 placebo ; 2 ) 240 mg BCX4208 placebo ; 3 ) 320 mg BCX4208 placebo . Unlike Part 1 , Part 2 dose-escalation design whereby cohort enrol sequentially , follow review efficacy , safety , tolerability data previous cohort . Enrollment cohort Part 2 3:1 ratio BCX4208 placebo 15 subject randomize BCX4208 group ( total 45 subject ) 15 subject randomize placebo . All study procedure Part 2 study , Screening Follow-Up Period , conduct describe Part 1 .</detailed_description>
