	<brief_title>AT9283 Children Adolescents With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety tolerability Aurora kinase inhibitor AT9283 characterize dose-limiting toxicity child adolescent relapse refractory solid tumor . - To determine maximum-tolerated dose regimen patient . Secondary - To determine pharmacokinetic parameter regimen patient . - To demonstrate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) activity regimen patient study effect surrogate tissue . - To assess preliminary evidence activity regimen use appropriate objective tumor measurement patient . Tertiary - To demonstrate PD activity regimen patient study effect surrogate tumor tissue ( skin punch , bone marrow , tumor biopsy ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive Aurora kinase inhibitor AT9283 IV 72 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood skin tissue sample collect baseline periodically treatment pharmacokinetic study pharmacodynamic biomarker ( M30 , M65 , pHH53 , p53 , PCNA Ki67 ) analysis IHC ELISA assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
