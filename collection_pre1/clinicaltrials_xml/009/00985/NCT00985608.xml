	<brief_summary>H pylori gastric infection one prevalent infectious disease worldwide . The discovery upper gastrointestinal disease relate H pylori infection therefore treat antibiotic important medical advance . Currently , first-line triple therapy base proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) ranitidine bismuth citrate ( RBC ) plus two antibiotic ( clarithromycin amoxicillin nitroimidazole ) recommend consensus conference guideline . Even correct use drug combination , infection eradicate 23 % patient . Therefore , several second line therapy recommend . A 7 quadruple therapy base PPI , bismuth , tetracycline metronidazole frequently accept . However , second-line therapy , bacterial eradication may fail 40 % case . When H pylori eradication strictly indicated choice treatment controversial . When available , endoscopy culture consequent antibiotic susceptibility test remains appropriate option patient two eradication failure avoid widespread use expensive antibiotic . The use drug may also induce severe side-effects development H pylorus resistant strain . Resistant strain Helicobacter pylori display dense biofilm mucus microorganism coccoid shape mucosal surface stomach may role determine resistance antibiotic therapy . Possibly , N-acetil-cysteine ( NAC ) may dissolve biofilm architecture help eradicate resistant strain H pylorus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Acetilcysteine 'Rescue ' Therapy Helicobacter Pylori Infection . Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate usefulness NAC pre-treatment attempt associate culture-guided antibiotic therapy rescue therapy multi-attempts antibiotic failure , first phase study , effect NAC biofilm formation demolition test vitro add NAC culture H pylorus isolates limit number patient ( n10 ) history least 4 fail eradicate attempt . Two biopsy sample gastric mucosa obtain endoscopy microbiological purpose . Specimens use H pylori culture . In specimens 5 patient , H pylorus culture together NAC 2 mg , 5 case , H pylori culture carry without NAC . In latter , biofilm formation , H pylori isolates face different dos NAC ( 2 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg ) observe behavior biofilm . In second phase study , 40 patient , least four unsuccessful H pylorus eradication attempt , consecutively recruit . During endoscopy , patient , least 4 mucosal biopsy obtain gastric body . Two biopsy use biofilm study scan electron microscopy ( SEM ) . The remain biopsy use H pylori culture . From culture , vitro antibiotic susceptibility test together genetic analysis H pylorus isolates perform . On basis antibiotic susceptibility test alone , patient randomly assign receive two different eradication schedule : Group A , patient receive NCA 600 mg day week subsequently culture-guided one-week regimen include PPI plus two antibiotic H pylorus ; group B ( control ) , patient receive solely culture-guided one-week antibiotic treatment include PPI plus two antibiotic . Sensitive antibiotic always choose basis favorable minimum inhibit concentration value . patient diary record side effect symptoms therapy . Compliance measure count tablet return 7-day treatment . Patients take control C13 urea breath test least two month end therapy . They also invite repeat endoscopic examination monitoring biofilm persistence absence . Finally , result obtain two treatment arm compare evaluate also light genetic analysis H pylorus isolates .</detailed_description>
