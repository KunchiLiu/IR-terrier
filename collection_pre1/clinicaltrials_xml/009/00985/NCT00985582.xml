	<brief_summary>The aim study characterise clinical efficacy virological clearance dynamic orally administer oseltamivir patient influenza cause novel influenza A ( H1N1 ) . This research also contribute enhance research capacity affect country . The objective ass : - viral replication level time affect patient - antiviral efficacy oral oseltamivir - pattern compartment viral shed , tissue distribution - innate inflammatory response relation viral replication - kinetics antibody response - antiviral sensitivity influenza virus baseline oseltamivir treatment use vitro molecular method - pharmacokinetic characteristic oseltamivir oseltamivir carboxylate - cause hospital mortality - clinical radiological feature , disease course outcome - length stay hospital - risk factor associate development severe disease death</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Any patient 1 year age present participate institution confirm influenza A meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion may approach informed consent . Choice antiviral study physician . Children age 1-6 year asthmatic receive oseltamivir . The weight- age-adjusted dosage use approve treatment uncomplicated seasonal influenza , dose administer twice daily 5 day patient normal renal function . All patient clinical and/or virologic failure day 5 treat additional 5 day antiviral . After come antiviral therapy patient discharge day 10 deem ready study physician virologically negative . During course treatment study evaluation perform determine primary efficacy end point include viral clearance Day 5 collect nasopharyngeal sample , assess RT PCR novel H1N1 influenza AND clinical feature clinical failure . Evaluations also perform determine secondary viral , serological , clinical efficacy , safety pharmacokinetic endpoint . Patients follow 6 month discharge clinical assessment , pulmonary function outcome pregnancy . The protocol review 6 month start 100 patient Influenza A recruit .</detailed_description>
