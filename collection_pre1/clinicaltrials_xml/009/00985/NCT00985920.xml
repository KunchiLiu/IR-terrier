	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , definitive treatment osteoarthritis , often associate excessive postoperative bleeding due increase fibrinolysis . Hence , objective propose study determine role topical application tranexamic acid ( TA ) , anti-fibrinolytic agent , knee joint closure TKA reduce perioperative bleeding . The investigator ' hypothesis patient undergoing unilateral primary TKA , intraoperative application 1.5 g 3.0g topical TA knee joint closure reduce perioperative bleeding depict decrement maximal drop hemoglobin concentration follow surgery . This proposal describe randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial three arm . The primary outcome extent postoperative reduction hemoglobin level . Secondary outcome include transfusion requirement , hospital stay , joint functionality , quality life safety use topical TA . Topical application TA novel intraoperative approach use studied TKA . However effective , directly reduce postoperative intra-articular bleeding without subsequent systemic absorption thromboembolism . In addition , reduction microvascular intra-articular bleed lead less pain infection rate well improved surgical functional outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Tranexamic Acid Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three million ( 1 10 ) Canadians suffer Osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , i.e . knee replacement surgery definitive treatment knee osteoarthritis alleviate pain restores physical functioning . However , associate excessive postoperative bleed lead increased mortality morbidity . The current blood conservation technique , i.e . preoperative erythropoietin autologous blood donation , reduce bleed surgical site . As result , many patient require blood transfusion associate risk cost . In TKA , postoperative bleeding attribute diffuse microvascular bleed result increase fibrinolytic activity cause release tourniquet routinely apply provide appropriate surgical exposure surgery . Therefore , tranexamic acid ( TA ) , antifibrinolytic agent block dissolution hemostatic fibrin , decrease blood loss follow TKA . The systemic administration TA , however , carry risk thromboembolic event deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . In TKA , great importance , patient high risk thromboembolic event . Topical application TA surgical field cost-effective simple route administration show reduce bleed dental , cardiac , spine surgery minimize systemic absorption thromboembolism . Another major advantage approach prevent diffuse microvascular bleed site raw tissue surface result decreased infection rate , pain , increase range motion ( ROM ) knee joint . In spite potential benefit , innovative idea topical application TA study TKA . However , show efficacious decrease postoperative bleeding , incorporate routine clinical practice immediate beneficial impact patient care quality life . Hypothesis : In patient undergoing unilateral primary/revision TKA , intraoperative application 1.5 g 3 g topical TA surgical wound five minute closure reduce perioperative bleeding depict maximal drop systemic hemoglobin concentration postoperative period . General Objective : To study role tranexamic acid therapeutic tool , apply intraoperatively surgical wound , reduce perioperative blood loss patient undergoing unilateral primary/revision TKA . Specific Objectives : To determine : - efficacy topical application TA reduce perioperative transfusion requirement . - safety topical application TA ( complication DVT ) . - systemic absorption TA topical application surgical wound . - impact postoperative hemoglobin ( Hb ) reduction patient ' quality life . - impact topical application TA length hospital stay . - impact topical application TA ROM , pain , surgical infection rate knee joint . - incidence autologous allogenic blood transfusion patient receive standard . - multimodal blood conservation technique TKA surgery institution - compare efficacy safety high dose ( 3 g ) TA versus low dose ( 1.5 g ) TA .</detailed_description>
