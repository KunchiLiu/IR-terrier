	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety potential benefit CERE-120 treatment Parkinson 's disease . CERE-120 experimental drug consist adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) engineer carry human gene neurturin , neurotrophic ( growth ) factor . Similar growth factor ( GDNF ) , neurturin capable restore function protect brain cell damage . The virus use CERE-120 known cause disease people . CERE-120 deliver directly brain cell affect Parkinson 's disease - dopamine produce neuron . CERE-120 inject brain surgery . Once place , CERE-120 continuously produce neurturin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy CERE-120 Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately sixty patient Parkinson 's disease participate study . The first part study ( Phase 1 ) complete . Six people Parkinson 's disease receive CERE-120 Phase 1 without complication . The second part study ( Phase 2 ) provide information safety CERE-120 also evaluate beneficial treatment Parkinson 's disease . In Phase 2 , approximately 52 people Parkinson 's disease enrol . Half subject receive CERE-120 half undergo `` placebo '' surgery medication inject . Treatment assignment random ( like flip coin ) . Participants phase study follow three year surgery . In study , CERE-120 inject neurosurgeon directly substantia nigra ( dopamine produce cell locate ) putamen ( dopamine cell project ) . CERE-120 carefully study laboratory animal without toxicity despite high dos . In addition , animal symptoms similar Parkinson 's disease , CERE-120 show protect brain cell restore function . CERE-120 previously study 50 people Parkinson 's enrolled two clinical study . These patient follow 2 year ( almost 5 year ) far CERE-120 well tolerate . Whereas CERE-120 better placebo primary efficacy measure complete study , several measure improvement suggest modest benefit . In order build upon finding increase chance strong clinical benefit , dose increase modification delivery target implement current study .</detailed_description>
