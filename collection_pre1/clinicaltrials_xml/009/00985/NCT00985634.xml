	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study demonstrate clinical safety efficacy LeGoo™ comparison standard vessel occlusion method ( i.e . vessel loop ) . Although LeGoo™ suitable use vascular surgery temporary vessel occlusion desire , study specifically focus use LeGoo™ off-pump coronary bypass ( OPCAB ) , sensitive model adverse change may occur vascular site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation LeGoo™ Internal Vessel Occluder Versus Traditional Vessel Loops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate clinical efficacy LeGoo™ compare traditional vessel loop . LeGoo device intend used surgical procedure temporarily occlude blood vessel form anastomosis . LeGoo™ evaluate subject undergo off-pump coronary artery by-pass ( OPCAB ) surgery . This prospective , randomized trial 30-day follow-up period . Half eligible patient randomized experimental group ( LeGoo™ ) ; half control group ( standard vessel loop ) . LeGoo™ polymer-based device comprise non-toxic biocompatible gel exist liquid low temperature rapidly transition solid body temperature , form plug occlude blood vessel . LeGoo™ inject blood vessel intend occlude , stay `` plug '' form several minute allow surgeon work bloodless field . The gel dissolve time ( spontaneously ) reverse back liquid instantly cool site ice irrigate cold saline . Once dissolved minimum concentration , polymer never re-solidify . The primary research hypothesis surgeon obtain bloodless surgical field achieve satisfactory hemostasis large proportion anastomosis use LeGoo™ use conventional temporary hemostasis technique . Satisfactory hemostasis define surgeon quantitate his/her observation quality surgical field use follow score system : 1 . - Excellent hemostasis ( bleed ) 2 . - Minimal bleeding ( bleed interfere suture ) 3 . - Modest bleeding ( require intermittent use another device control bleed site anastomosis ) 4 . - Copious bleeding ( require continuous use another device ) `` Excellent hemostasis '' `` minimal bleeding '' consider `` satisfactory hemostasis . '' Satisfactory hemostasis constitute treatment success purpose evaluate primary efficacy LeGoo . The primary endpoint proportion anastomose satisfactory hemostasis achieve .</detailed_description>
