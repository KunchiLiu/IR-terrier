	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Lamivudine Two Different Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lamivudine ( 3TC ) approve regulatory authority treatment HIV infection current license dose 300 mg daily . Clinical pharmacokinetic ( drug absorb , distribute eliminate body ) data suggest licensing dose could reduce without compromise effectiveness . Lower drug dos could reduce side−effects medication would make 3TC affordable . This study compare pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability two different dos 3TC healthy volunteer . The study take place Chelsea Westminster Hospital . Twenty four healthy HIV negative volunteer randomly allocate two group . Volunteers Group 1 start 300mg 3TC daily 10 day , follow 10 day take 3TC ( wash−out period ) . When wash−out period end , re−start 3TC dose 150mg daily 10 day . Group 2 similar except start 150mg 3TC beginning study 300mg 3TC wash−out period . Blood sample take 24-hour period end dose phase measure level 3TC blood inside blood cell . Safety tolerability 3TC assessed question , physical examination laboratory parameter . These perform regular interval treatment phase . Healthy participant determine medical history physical examination eligible participate study . HIV−positive participant recruit yet clear experimentally reduce dose 3TC successfully treat HIV−infection . There reason presume meaningful difference metabolic process 3TC HIV−infected HIV−uninfected people .</detailed_description>
