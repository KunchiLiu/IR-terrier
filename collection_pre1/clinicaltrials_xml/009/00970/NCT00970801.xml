	<brief_summary>The incidence pulmonary disease cause nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) increase , substantial proportion patient preexist lung disease demonstrable immunodeficiency . These patient predominantly nonsmoking elderly woman . High-resolution compute tomography scan reveal characteristic finding multifocal bronchiectasis combine multiple small nodule . NTMs ubiquitous environmental organism . Because exposure organism universal occurrence disease rare , normal host defense mechanism must effective enough prevent infection . All patient NTM lung disease need receive long-term antibiotic treatment . As American Thoracic Society guideline point , one difficult question may start antibiotic therapy patient NTM lung disease . The decision begin treatment make weigh anticipated benefit risk . The decision relatively easy patient profound symptom destructive lesion ; however , decision difficult patient mild symptom non-advanced lesion . Factors must consider include patient ' age , whether symptom mild equivocal , presence comorbidities . In case , close observation necessary treatment perform . However , study show patient certain characteristic show disease progression . The treatment NTM pulmonary disease depend infect specie , decision concern institution treatment never easy . Treatment require use multiple drug 18 24 month . Thus , treatment expensive , often significant side effect , frequently curative . Therefore , clinician confident sufficient pathology warrant prolong , multidrug treatment regimen . In situation , outcomes best optimized clinician , radiologist , laboratory work cooperatively . This study examine people susceptible NTM lung disease people NTM lung disease difficult treat . This study examine patient bacterial characteristic , course disease treatment NTM infection , well genetics involve infection . Patients diagnose NTM lung disease may eligible study . All participant medical family history , blood test , image study may include X-rays , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , genetic serologic study . The aim study identify patient bacterial characteristic contribute disease susceptibility , disease progression , treatment failure . Subjects recruit among patient diagnose NTM lung disease Samsung Medical Center Republic Korea .</brief_summary>
