	<detailed_description>With 90 million new case annually , Chlamydia trachomatis common sexually transmit bacterial disease . Untreated endocervical C. trachomatis infection cause pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) , disorder endometrium , fallopian tube , adjacent structure occur ascension bacterium low upper genital tract . Adverse outcome secondary C. trachomatis-induced PID include tubal infertility , ectopic pregnancy , chronic pelvic pain . Vaccine development identify essential control C. trachomatis infection , current evidence suggest effective vaccine likely base several C. trachomatis antigen . Experimental model infection identify HSP60 , major outer-membrane protein ( MOMP ) , outer membrane protein 2 ( OMP2 ) , polymorphic membrane protein D ( PmpD ) promise vaccine candidate . A prospective study Kenyan commercial sex worker find production interferon-gamma ( IFN-Î³ ) peripheral blood cell stimulate chlamydia heat-shock protein ( HSP60 ) strongly correlate protection incident C. trachomatis infection . This proposal detail exploratory identification antigen-specific cell mediate immune response associate antecedent C. trachomatis infection woman . C. trachomatis obligate , intracellular , gram-negative microorganism recognize common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide . The high rate infection organism consistently find among adolescent young adult . Young woman also group adversely impacted effect C. trachomatis infection reproductive health . While approximately 70 % infection C. trachomatis young woman asymptomatic , 20 % - 40 % occult infection progress endocervical inflammation development PID . In addition strong association PID , C. trachomatis infection also think enhance HIV transmission contribute human papilloma virus induce cervical neoplasia . Although data experimental model clinical study suggest antigen specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell require optimal control genital tract chlamydial infection , current lack information regard specific C. trachomatis antigens elicit protective immune response human hinders vaccine development . This exploratory investigation develop methodology need identify antigen-specific cell mediate immune response strongly associate protection incident C. trachomatis infection .</detailed_description>
