	<brief_summary>This study evaluate feasibility , safety , efficacy intradermal vaccination prostate cancer patient alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cell ( DC1 ) load apoptotic allogeneic tumor ( LNCap ) . The study target men recurrent prostate cancer , fail local therapy , measurable metastasis , rise PSA double time le 10 month . The selection study group enable u evaluate time PSA progression , highly relevant , clinical primary endpoint efficacy two arm study . In order facilitate infiltration vaccination-induced T cell tumor site ( ) reduce tumor-specific tolerance , subject receive vaccine combination limit androgen ablation ( AA ) LHRH analogue 3 month . Subjects randomly assign one two cohort . In cohort A subject first treat limited AA alone 3 month , time PSA relapse ( PSA ≥ 1 ng/dL ) receive DC vaccine conjunction AA . In cohort B , sequence treatment reverse . Efficacy estimate within-subject difference time PSA relapse follow combination treatment compare AA alone , thus , subject serve control . All subject commence DC1-based vaccination 2 week prior treatment LHRH analogue . Each subject receive 1 intradermal ( i.d . ) dose vaccine week 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 total 4 dos . Additional course vaccination may administer subject without evidence disease progression every 3 month ( ±1 month ) 12 month depend number dos originally produce available 4 intend protocol dos . All dos vaccine administer intradermally ( i.d . ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell ( DC ) -Based Vaccines Loaded With Allogeneic Prostate Cell Lines Combination With Androgen Ablation Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell `` DCs '' special white blood cell stimulate immune system . This study do test feasibility , safety efficacy specific type dendritic cell inject skin patient prostate cancer . The researcher conduct study evaluate time prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) progression also perform test see immune system respond injection . This 2 group crossover trial patient randomly assign one two treatment arm : A . 3 month androgen ablation ( AA ) follow PSA progression 3 month combination AA alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine ( DC1 ) ; B . 3 month combination AA alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine follow PSA progression 3 month AA . Primary Objectives - Feasibility objective : ability successfully generate administer alpha-DC1 vaccine . - Safety objective : assess tolerability toxicity alpha-DC1 vaccine . - Efficacy objective : evaluate effect alpha-DC1 vaccine time PSA progression compare AA alone . PSA progression define rise PSA value e 1.0 ng/mL . Secondary Objectives - To determine change PSA velocity prior follow propose treatment . - To evaluate ( subject ) vaccination-induced DTH response LNCap , cell line vaccine , compare vaccination-induced response tumor-untreated antigen ( KLH ) . - To evaluate vaccination-induced change Th1/Th2 profile response PAP PSMA . - To evaluate CTL response blood whole LNCap cell ( subject ) ( subject HLA-A2 positive ) CTL responses HLA-A2.1 restrict peptide derive PAP PSMA . - To comprehensively evaluate CD4+ CD8+ T cell response ( fine specificity Th1/Th2/Treg cytokine profile ) previously-identified novel immunogenic epitope PAP PSMA , use EPIMAX system . This 2 group crossover trial patient randomly assign one two treatment arm : A . 3 month androgen ablation ( AA ) follow PSA progression 3 month combination AA alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine ( DC1 ) ; B . 3 month combination AA alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine follow PSA progression 3 month AA . In crossover trial patient serve control . Following either therapy time PSA progression , define time treatment first instance PSA increase 1ng/ml . The endpoint difference time PSA progression combination AA + DC1 compare AA alone . A total 12 evaluable patient ( 6 patients/arm ) enrol trial . Patients complete course ( AA AA+DCV ) replace . This schema also help u good estimate time PSA recovery follow 3 month limit androgen ablation cohort patient . All patient Cohort B , commence DC1-based vaccination 2 week prior treatment LHRH analogue . Each patient receive four i.d . dos vaccine week 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 . The LHRH analogue ( Lupron 22.5 mg Zoladex 10.8 mg ) , administer 2 week 1st dose DC vaccine . Additional course vaccination administer patient without evidence disease progression , every 3 month 12 month . Patients undergo thorough pre-study evaluation , undergo leukapheresis generate DC-based vaccine . Each patient receive 4 dos intradermal ( i.d . ) DC1-based vaccine week 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Patients histologically proven prostate cancer tumor limit prostate ( include seminal vesicle involvement , provide visible disease surgically remove ) complete local therapy elevate PSA surgery rise PSA radiation therapy , define . Age 18 year old Histologically confirm diagnosis prostate cancer . Previous treatment definitive surgery radiation therapy . No evidence metastatic disease physical exam , CT/MRI/CXR ( see Section 7.1 radiologic imaging ) , bone scan within 4 week prior randomization . Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal , androgen deprivation therapy , chemotherapy allow last used &gt; 12 month prior first vaccination . No therapy modulate testosterone level ( leuteinizinghormone releasinghormone agonists/antagonists antiandrogens ) permit within 12 month prior first vaccination . Agents 5αreductase inhibitor , ketoconazole , megestrol acetate , systemic steroid ( replacement dose steroid allow ) , PCSPES , Saw Palmetto permit time period PSA value collect . Hormonesensitive prostate cancer evident serum total testosterone level &gt; 150 ng/dL &gt; 6 nmol/L time enrollment within 4 week prior randomization . All patient must evidence biochemical progression determine reference PSA value follow 1 confirmatory rise PSA value , high previous value , obtain least 2 week apart . All PSA value must obtain reference lab , must do within 6 month prior enrollment . The recent PSA value must ≥ 2.0 ng/mL . This measurement must obtain within 1 month prior enrollment . The PSA doubling time ( PSADT ) must less 12 month . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL Total bilirubin 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN Creatinine 1.5 x ULN The effect dendritic cell vaccine develop human fetus unknown . For reason men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Exclusion Criteria Patients must receive investigational agent concurrent anticancer therapy . No uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
