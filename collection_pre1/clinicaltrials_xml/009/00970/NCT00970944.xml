	<brief_summary>This control trial amantadine improve level function follow severe traumatic brain injury . The purpose study : 1 . To determine whether amantadine hydrochloride , give dose 200-400 mg , improve functional recovery vegetative minimally conscious state 2 . To determine whether amantadine-related gain function persist follow drug discontinuation 3 . To determine safety profile amantadine patient disorder consciousness</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Amantadine Hydrochloride Treatment Severe Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe traumatic brain injury may result severe disorder consciousness ( DOC ) , include coma , vegetative state ( VS ) minimally conscious state ( MCS ) . The long duration impair consciousness , bad ultimate functional prognosis , half individual remain unconscious month post-TBI regaining consciousness within year . The severe functional disability associate prolonged DOC place enormous emotional , financial , ethical , logistical strain caregiver major resource demand society . Numerous treatment recommend hasten return consciousness improve ultimate level recovery , include various psychotropic drug , `` coma stimulation '' therapy others . However , none treatment proven efficacy well-controlled research . The main obstacle Class I evidence area small sample individual serious DOC individual facility , variability recovery trajectory within heterogeneous population , reluctance undertake placebo control trial . In proposed study , 7 facility ( include two TBI Model Systems designation ) participate multi-center research network call Consciousness Consortium , join four additional brain injury rehabilitation center ( two U.S. two Europe ) Data Coordinating Center Columbia University , conduct prospective double blind randomize control trial amantadine hydrochloride . 184 patient remain VS MCS 4 - 16 week post-TBI randomized stratify fashion 4 week amantadine ( 200 - 400 mg/day ) vs. placebo , follow 2-week washout period . The Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) primary dependent variable Coma Recovery Scale-Revised ( CRS-R ) serve supplementary measure . We hypothesize superior recovery amantadine group maintenance advantage washout . We also explore whether treatment response differs time post-injury diagnosis ( i.e. , VS MCS ) treatment onset , whether specific outcome importance caregiver achieve often amantadine group . We develop plan intensive education caregiver clinician study address perceive barrier enrollment also use information gather interaction develop consumer-oriented dissemination activity . Project output finding disseminate appropriate consumer professional audience use variety format include : ( 1 ) improve family member understanding DOC facilitate improve adjustment caregiving ( 2 ) clear guidance clinician regard effectiveness amantadine person DOC .</detailed_description>
