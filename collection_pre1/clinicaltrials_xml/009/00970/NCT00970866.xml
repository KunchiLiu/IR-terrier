	<brief_title>Efficacy Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements ( LNS ) Pregnant Lactating Women Their Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Inadequate nutrient intake pregnancy remain major problem worldwide . The standard nutritional intervention pregnancy iron-folic acid tablet , adherence generally quite low . We pioneer use lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNS ) , multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid paste make use vegetable oil , groundnut paste , milk , sugar , micronutrient , home fortification complementary food infant . Given result previous study Nutributter Ghana ( 1 , 2 ) similar LNS Malawi ( 3 , 4 ) believe food-based approach use LNS potential improve nutritional status woman , thereby also enhance child 's growth micronutrient status . Our consortium formulate LNS-P &amp; L pregnant lactate woman , modify Nutributter child , call LNS-20gM trial . The LNS-20gM provide generally Recommended Nutrient Intakes ( RNI ) 18 vitamin mineral infant 6 18 mo age . The LNS-P &amp; L model UNICEF/WHO/UNU international multiple micronutrient preparation ( UNIMMAP ) pregnant lactate woman similar product use Guinea Bissau ( 5 ) . Each supplement ( 20 g/day ) provide 118 kcal/day . Both LNS product ( LNS-P &amp; L LNS-20gM ) , addition multiple micronutrient provide MMN , supply energy ( 118 kcal/d ) , fat ( 11 g/d ) , protein ( 2.6 g/d ) , essential fatty acid linoleic acid ( =1.29 g/d ) a-linolenic acid ( 0.29 &gt; 0.6 g/d ) , well calcium , phosphorus , potassium magnesium . Objectives The study two objective , : 1 . To evaluate effect LNS-P &amp; L nutritional status Ghanaian pregnant lactate woman . 2 . To assess effect LNS-P &amp; L give pregnant lactate woman LNS-20gM provide child 6 18 mo age child growth micronutrient status . Procedures 1 . Recruitment : This study community-based , randomize control trial three intervention group . Potential subject Ghanaian pregnant woman attend usual ante-natal clinic Government Hospitals Atua Akuse , St Martins de Porres Catholic Hospital Agormanya ( Manya Krobo District Ghana ) , Somanya Polyclinic Somanya ( Yilo Krobo District Ghana ) . Enrolment study do two step . First , pregnant woman meet initial set criterion ask consent ( sign Screening Consent Form ) participate pre-enrolment screen use Screening Questionnaire . During screening , conduct clinic , result routine ante-natal examination already enter Ante-natal Cards inspect . The screening questionnaire also collect additional information , description place residence , record Ante-natal card . Second , woman pass screen contact home , provide additional detail study seek consent recruitment . If agree , sign recruitment consent form , enrolment say complete . Immediately , collect background demographic socioeconomic information home use Baseline Questionnaire , schedule woman come laboratory complete baseline anthropometric laboratory assessment ( blood urine sampling , hemoglobin , blood pressure Ultrasound gestational age ) . Pregnant woman ( n = 864 ) complete baseline assessment remain eligible study randomly assign ( use opaque envelope group designation ) one three group : ( 1 ) Group 1 : Iron Folic Acid , ( 2 ) Group 2 : Multiple Micronutrient ( MMN ) , ( 3 ) Group 3 : Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements ( LNS ) . 2 . Follow : Pregnant woman followed-up delivery , 6 mo postpartum ( i.e . remain part pregnancy time recruitment + 6 mo lactation ) , infant born woman followed-up birth 18 mo age . Field Workers visit subject home biweekly pregnancy weekly birth 18 mo provide supplement collect data morbidity adherence . In case multiple birth woman , ( e.g . twin triplet ) , one baby randomly select immediately delivery index child infant data blood sample collect . Anthropometric data collect unselected twin triplet , Group 3 receive LNS-20gM ( cultural belief twin triplet , etc. , must treat ) , blood sample collect unselected child . In case loss child/children delivery , mother followed-up 6 mo postpartum . In case loss mother delivery , baby followed-up 18 mo age . If woman study recommend take additional vitamin and/ mineral physician , work physician ensure supplement give lead excess intake . 3 . Outcome measure : The study two primary outcome namely : 1 . Maternal primary outcome : Birth length , 2 . Child primary outcome : Child length-for-age z-score 18 mo . Secondary outcome include : i. Maternal : - Anthropometric status ( weight , BMI , mid upper arm circumference sub- scapular skin-fold thickness ) ~ 36 wk gestation 6 , 12 , 18 mo postpartum . - Pregnancy outcome ( birth weight , gestational age ) . - Anemia , micronutrient ( iron , vitamin A , B-vitamins , zinc ) EFA status , malarial antigen ~ 36 wk gestation 6 mo postpartum . - Total plasma cholesterol ~ 36 wk gestation . - Blood pressure urinary iodine , isoprostane ( marker oxidative stress ) 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) ( marker DNA damage ) 36 wk gestation . - Breast milk composition ( EFA , vitamin A , B-vitamins , iodine ) 6 mo postpartum . - Depressive symptom ( may relate EFA status ) 6 mo postpartum . ii . Child : - Anthropometric status ( weight , length , head circumference mid upper arm circumference ) birth 3 , 6 , 12 18 mo . - Anemia , micronutrient ( iron , vitamin A , B-vitamins , iodine ) EFA status , malarial antigen 6 18 mo . - Morbidity 6 18 mo . - Child feeding practice maternal report child sleep pattern 6 , 12 18 mo . - Energy intake complementary food 9 15 mo . - Antibody response measles vaccination 12 mo . - Achievement five motor milestone ( sit without support , stand alone , walk assistance , walk alone run ) four developmental milestone ( pronounce single word like mama / dada , wave goodbye , eat self , drink cup ) 0 18 mo . - Neuro-behavioral development 18 mo age .</detailed_description>
