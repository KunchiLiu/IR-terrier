	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride work treat patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Docetaxel , Gemcitabine Patients With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate 1-year progression-free survival rate patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treat bevacizumab , docetaxel , gemcitabine hydrochloride . Secondary - Evaluate median time progression patient treat regimen . - Estimate response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine median overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine incidence adverse event associate regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients responsive stable disease may continue receive bevacizumab alone 12 month absence disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
