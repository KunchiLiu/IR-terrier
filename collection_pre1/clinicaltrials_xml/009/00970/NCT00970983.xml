	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate disease free overall survival patient breast carcinomas small size , i.e. , great 2.0 cm clinically non palpable axillary lymph node , undergo either conservative surgery axillary dissection , similar treatment primary tumor rapid analysis sentinel lymph node , result determines axillary node dissection avoidance base .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axillary Dissection Based Histological Result Sentinel Node , Patients With Breast Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The axillary lymph node represent frequent site metastasis breast carcinoma . In previous study , show process metastasis axillary node proceeds orderly progressive fashion I II III level `` saltatory '' event metastasis represent rare event describe 2 % 6 % case . The risk metastasis directly correlate size primary tumor . When small 1 cm diameter , risk metastasis 10 % ; large 5 cm diameter , risk increase 70 % . The involvement axillary lymph node metastases constitutes today important prognostic factor breast cancer . Massive invasion certainly associate poor outcome therefore , information lymph node status provide , indispensible administration appropriate therapy postoperative period . Nevertheless , case lymph node find free metastasis , axillary dissection useless treatment prove harmful one considers possible short long term complication . Presently , diagnostic modality able provide accurate lymph node stag preoperatively . This information gain histologic examination lymph node complete axillary dissection . Standard treatment operable breast cancer today always involve dissection axillary lymph node , regardless surgical procedure use resection primary tumor , i.e . conservative demolitive . This result large expenditure resource ( longer surgical procedure general anesthesia ) , notably , increase risk complication ( lymphedema functional limitation involve extremity ) patient , secondary aggressive intervention axilla . A method utilize preoperative lymphoscintigraphy intraoperative use gamma-ray probe order evaluate possibility metastasis first axillary lymph node , i.e . `` sentinel node '' , recently put practice institute . This method , first part consist subcutaneous peritumoral administration radiolabeled ( 99Tc ) human albumin colloid ( see method section ) , allow isolation excision sentinel lymph node use gamma-ray probe 98.8 % case . In case procedure prove highly predictable patient outcome , numerous axillary lymphadenectomies could avoid , numerous complication associate aggressive intervention . A first phase study evaluate 238 patient breast carcinoma would candidate complete axillary dissection . Patients intraductal carcinoma , candidate primary chemotherapy , diagnosed pregnancy lactation , tumor less 1 cm size ( inclusion randomize trial ( 053 ) evaluate role radiotherapy axilla patient undergo conservative surgery without axillary node dissection ) exclude study . The result first phase show concordance histologic finding sentinel lymph node remain axillary lymph node , subdivide three level , 96.7 % case . Furthermore , concordance 100 % 18 patient breast carcinoma size equal le 1.0 cm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 40 75 year . Clinical , mammographic ultrasonographic diagnosis unicentric carcinoma ultrasonographic diameter equal le 2.0 cm . Although factor exclusion , breast scintigraphy use MDP99m recommend accurate determination possible multifocality multicentricity tumor , well determination possible bone metastasis . Axillary lymph node palpate clinically suspicious metastasis . No previously execute therapy ( include biopsy ) outside institution . Those patient nonpalpable lesion subject preoperative radioactive occult lesion localization ( ROLL ) stereotactic biopsy . Adequate patient information signature inform consent . Lesions diagnose noninfiltrating ( insitu ) ductal lobular carcinoma . Paget 's disease . Documented multicentricity and/or abundant multifocality neoplasm . Clinically metastatic lymph node . Patients previously biopsied institution . Carcinomas detect pregnancy lactation . Histotypes diverse breast carcinoma lesion . History previous malignancy ( exclude basocellular carcinoma , insitu cervical carcinoma and/or contralateral breast carcinoma without recurrence least 15 year followup ) .</criteria>
