	<brief_summary>The study examine biochemistry underlie human olfaction normal diseased state . The study aim : 1. determine level cAMP olfactory tissue people chronic rhinosinusitis nasal disorder . 2. correlate preoperative olfactory function cAMP level biopsied olfactory tissue . 3. determine odorant pheromone-mediated activation culture human olfactory sensory neuron use calcium image 4. determine odorant pheromone-mediated activation culture human olfactory sensory neuron use `` smell-chip '' technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject recruit scheduled endoscopic sinus surgery similar procedure . This study use tissue would normally discard surgical process . The tissue culture frozen purpose follow testing : odor detection signal transduction , cyclic adenosine monophosphate odor detection , role cAMP olfactory dysfunction , pheromone detection . Only tissue would normally discard course surgery use . The study interfere change clinical care .</detailed_description>
