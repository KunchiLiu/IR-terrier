	<brief_summary>The study design test follow primary hypothesis : - Aerobic exercise training improve insulin sensitivity insulin resistant subject change major cellular signal pathway and/or regulator . Accordingly , propose study design accomplish follow specific aim : - Quantitate exercise training improve insulin sensitivity decrease cardiovascular risk factor general population lean , nondiabetic , insulin resistant subject . Effects know cardiovascular risk factor include blood pressure serum lipoproteins evaluate . Change regional adiposity also measure - Determine effect program regular aerobic exercise insulin receptor signal pathway . Biopsies vastus lateralis muscle insulin resistant subject obtain hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp . This procedure take place untrained state exercise training . The investigator measure change insulin receptor activity major component intracellular insulin signal pathway . The investigator also look intracellular protein regulate signal pathway .</brief_summary>
