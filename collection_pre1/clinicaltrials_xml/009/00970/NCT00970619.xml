	<brief_summary>Rationale : Iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis ( IFDVT ) associate significant post thrombotic morbidity . The presence obstruction reflux significantly increase chance development post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . Early thrombolysis may reduce incidence PTS compare treatment conventional anticoagulant medication alone . Improvement health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) report surgical clot removal . The investigator hypothesize improvement could also reach catheter direct thrombolysis . Objective : To assess whether catheter direct thrombolytic therapy treatment IFDVT safely effectively reduce post thrombotic morbidity one year . The secondary objective study whether catheter direct thrombolytic intervention positive effect quality life patient IFDVT ass late PTS . Study design : prospective , non blind , randomize , control , multicenter , intervention study Study population : The study population include consecutive patient IFDVT present emergency outpatient department participate centre . The thrombus old 14 day randomization . Intervention : After randomization patient allocate either conservative anticoagulant treatment catheter direct thrombolysis combine conservative anticoagulant treatment . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary efficacy outcome incidence PTS one year ; decline PTS incidence 25 % 8 % anticipate . The secondary outcome Health relate Quality life late PTS follow-up . The principal safety outcome major bleed anticoagulant therapy . Bleeding well event recurrent thrombosis monitor . The patency venous system affect low limb assess well percentage clot lysis , thrombolytic intervention . Additionally , measurement marker coagulation inflammation perform follow-up . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : For patient randomize intervention arm study hospital stay 24-36 hour mandatory catheter direct thrombolysis . All patient undergo additional imaging MRA-vasovist air phletysmography ( APG ) baseline 12 month . Clinical follow-up visit match usual care 3 , 6 , 12 month ; blood take visit . Health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) questionnaires filled patient baseline , 3 , 6 12 month event ; year entire study duration . Further treatment accordance current guideline antithrombotic treatment . There may enhance risk bleed thrombolysis group . The expected benefit reduction PTS 25 % 8 % , together improve quality life .</brief_summary>
