	<brief_summary>Background : No medical treatment prove efficacy treatment hypertensive leg ulcer well design trial . Primary aim study : compare rate heal hypertensive leg ulcer treat becaplermin gel ( Regranex Gel® ) daily application versus application quantity hydrogel ( Duoderm Hydrogel™ ) , correspond excipient becaplermin gel . Method : Ambulatory hospitalize patient present hypertensive leg ulcer , randomize receive either daily application becaplermin gel hydrogel 8 week . At week 8 , pinch graft propose patient ulcer heal . Primary aim study : Complete closure week 8 Secondary aim : percentage wind area reduction week 8 , complete closure week 12 , pain quality life treatment Study hypothesis : becaplermin gel may promote heal hypertensive leg ulcer alternative medical treatment skin graft usually propose</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Becaplermin Gel MARTORELL 's Hypertensive Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertensive leg ulcer variety leg ulcer characterize painful spread lesion , relate cutaneous microangiopathy , occur patient present hypertension /or diabetes . Healing take mean 4 12 month . Current treatment difficult usually surgical ( pinch mesh skin graft ) . Growth factor release autografted skin may significant factor promotion hypertensive leg ulcer heal . Recombinant human platelet derive growth-factor-BB gel ( becaplermin gel ) show effective treatment diabetic ulcer relate diabetic microangiopathy . The objective study ass efficacy becaplermin gel heal hypertensive leg ulcer . Study design : prospective , randomize , multi-centre , double blind , control , parallel groupPrimary aim : complete wound closure week 8Secondary aim : complete wound closure week 12 , pain quality life assessment treatment ( W4,8,10,12 ) , % wound area reduction week 8 12 Method : Inclusion 64 patient , 32 group . The study population consist consecutive patient present one leg ulcer diagnose hypertensive MARTORELL 's ulcer : hypertensive and/or diabetic patient , absence chronic venous insufficiency ( C5-C6 CEAP ) peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( presence peripheral pulse ankle brachial index ≥0.8 ) , superficial spread necrotic ulcer , presence spontaneous pain , presence red purpuric margin . Treatment consist daily application continuous thin layer becaplermin gel ( Regranex Gel® ) Duoderm Hydrogel™ , 8 week . The amount gel apply determine base ulcer area inclusion ( recommended Regranex gel® ) , remain identical treatment . Wound recover moist saline gauze bandage . Duoderm Hydrogel™ sodium carboxymethylcellulose aqueous-based gel , similar composition becaplermin excipient.At week 8 , pinch graft propose patient ulcer heal . Between week 8 12 , patient heal graft , dress choose investigator , depend wound stage . All patient follow week 12 .</detailed_description>
