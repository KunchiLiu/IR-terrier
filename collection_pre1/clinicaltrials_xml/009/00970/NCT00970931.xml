	<brief_summary>The incidence hypertension individual pre-hypertension 80 % ten year study conduct Southern Brazil . The effectiveness non-drug intervention prevent hypertension low long term . It may hypothesize population-based drug intervention could reduce relevantly burden hypertension cardiovascular disease . Diuretics least efficacious blood pressure-lowering drug , well tolerate , long duration action advantage low cost use population intervention . Chlorthalidone efficacious agent . Its main limitation induce hypokalemia proportion patient , adverse effect antagonize potassium-sparing diuretic , amiloride . A study objective therefore recommendable Brazil , order support plan precocious intervention individual pre-hypertension . Such study demand funded Health Technology Ministries Brazil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This nation-based trial , 24 clinical center distribute 9 States . A Coordinating Committee responsible elaboration proposal main decision trial . The organizational chart study include executive Committee , safety committee , outcome committee , lab EKG center , research unit Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) already lead cause death Brazil . High blood pressure major risk factor CVD . The risk start blood pressure value low 115/75 mmHg increase exponentially confer high absolute risk blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg . The prevalence hypertension Brazil establish population-based study conduct different city States , vary 22.3 44 % adult The benefit treatment individual pre-hypertension cardiovascular disease demonstrate several clinical trial . In face high incidence hypertension individual pre-hypertension , low effectiveness non-drug intervention risk cardiovascular event end-organ damage lower blood pressure level , may advisable start blood pressure drug low dos point inexorable elevation blood pressure age . Research question 1 . Does association low dose chlorthalidone amiloride reduce incidence hypertension individual pre-hypertension ? 2 . Does association low dose chlorthalidone amiloride reduce incidence cardiovascular event patient pre-hypertension ? 3 . 2 . Does association low dose chlorthalidone amiloride reduce incidence target-organ damage patient pre-hypertension ? Methods Design : randomize , double-blind , clinical trial , control placebo . Eligible participant : individual 30 70 year age pre-hypertension . Exclusion criterion : low life expectancy , indication use diuretic , cardiovascular disease , intolerance study drug , pregnancy . Random allocation : computer generate list , stratify center . Interventions : Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg identical placebo . Primary outcome : 1 . Incidence hypertension , blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg individual without diabetes ≥ 135/85 mmHg participant diabetes . 2 . Adverse event . 3 . Development worsen microalbuminuria leave ventricular hypertrophy EKG .</detailed_description>
