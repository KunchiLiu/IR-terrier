	<brief_summary>Ultimately marker microglial activation could use large-scale quantitative brain imaging trial Alzheimer Disease ( AD ) , Parkinson Disease ( PD ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , specifically investigate agent objective biomarker treatment aim reduce inflammatory change condition . The significance work lie apply state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tool develop relevant biomarker individual neurodegenerative disease intention use efficiently large clinical imaging trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The adaptation image agent like [ 18F ] -FEPPA biomarker microglial activation neurodegenerative neuroinflammatory disease require human validation study . Expanding upon previous work B-amyloid ligand ( 123I-IMPY , 123I MNI-187 ) AD dopamine transporter ligands ( 123I B-CIT , Altropane ) PD , desire develop characterize [ 18F ] -FEPPA potential marker microglial activation association neuronal damage may applicable multiple neurodegenerative inflammatory disease .</detailed_description>
