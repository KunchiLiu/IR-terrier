The second day Test Day 1 , actual tasting record . Women ask consume 45 g koko mixed LNS P &amp; L ( prepared mix 150 g LNS-P &amp; L 600 g fresh koko moisture content 90 % ) . Time take consume entire amount , proportion amount consume within 15 minute , measure . Women ask rate mixture 's appearance , aroma , flavor , consistency overall degree like use hedonic scale . On third day ( Test Day 2 ) trial , procedure repeat use koko mixed Nutributter instead . Koko test feeding provide project . Project staff purchase ferment dough ( main ingredient ) local market prepare koko good hygienic condition project house . After preparation , koko keep hot thermos flask prior serve study participant MCH clinic . Between time koko prepared time test feeding complete , take 2-3 hour , koko keep temperature 70 - 90 °C inside thermos flask prevent bacterial contamination . The Nutributter LNS supplement commercially produce Nutriset SAS ( Malaunay , France ) provide Project test . 2 . Test-feeding LNS20gM : After consent , mother ( care-taker ) participate infant ask come clinic child next day orientation session background data collect experimental procedure practice include taste food completion taste questionnaire .
