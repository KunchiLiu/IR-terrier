	<detailed_description>Caudal block ( CB ) gold standard technique analgesia child undergo surgical intervention groin . Although efficacy safety technique high , nonetheless , several caveat unwarranted motor blockade low limb disturbance bladder function , potentially result delay demission ambulatory setting . The effect blockade wear within 4-5h post-block , make administration additional pain medication necessary . Peripheral nerve blockade ( PNB ) alternative CB prolong duration analgesic effect . More recently , alternative method block neural structure innervate low abdominal wall describe ; transverse abdominal plane block . The ultrasound guide technique improves safety margin . However , although new technique seem offer substantial advantage far experience small case series available . In particular , TAP block compare systematic trial `` gold standard '' , caudal block .</detailed_description>
