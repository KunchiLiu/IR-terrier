	<brief_summary>The purpose study find drug AZD6244 improve radioactive iodine uptake patient 's metastatic thyroid cancer . The investigator also test tumor specimen take time surgery specific genetic change see one particular ( BRAF oncogene ) make cancer likely become sensitive radioactive iodine treatment drug . The investigator want find AZD6244 help increase entry radioactive iodine thyroid cancer cell spread resistant radioactive iodine therapy , especially BRAF mutation . To measure much iodine enter cancer , investigator use iodine-124 , different form radioactive iodine . Iodine-124 allow investigator measure precisely much radioactivity enter cancer cell , whereas iodine-131 . The process scan iodine-124 call `` lesional dosimetry '' . Iodine-124 investigational agent approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) use research study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients &gt; = 18 yearsold Patients must histopathologically confirm MSKCC differentiate thyroid carcinoma follicular cell origin ( DTCFCO ) , include papillary , follicular , Hürthle cell histology , along respective variant . Pathology specimen original tumor ( thyroid ) and/or metastasis must available genotyping . RAIrefractory metastatic disease structural imaging , define one following ( described MSKCC protocol 08066 ) : index metastatic lesion nonRAI avid diagnostic RAI scan perform 2 year prior enrolment current study , OR RAIavid metastatic lesion remain stable size progress despite RAI treatment 6 month prior entry study . Lesions assess 2 independent observer nuclear medicine endocrinology . There minimal size limit index lesion . Patients FDG avid lesion Evaluable disease RECIST Preliminary reproductive toxicology data indicate AZD6244 adverse effect embryofetal development survival dose level induce maternal toxicity mouse . For reason , female patient need postmenopausal negative serum pregnancy test premenopausal . Patients childbearing potential must agree employ adequate contraception throughout study . ANC &gt; 1500 per mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000 per mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ALT/SGOT AST/SGPT ≤ 2.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patient chronic renal insufficiency , define initially estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/minute calculate use Cockcroft Gault equation : ( 140 age year ) X ( weight kg ) X ( 0.85 female ) /72 X serum Cr . If estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min , 24 hour urine creatinine clearance may collect patient would eligible creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min . Patients unable follow low iodine diet , patient require medication high content iodide ( amiodarone ) , patient receive IV iodine contain contrast part radiographic procedure . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease define follow : LVEF &lt; institutional LLN New York Heart Association grade III great congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg OR diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg , least 2 repeated determination separate day within past 3 month Uncontrolled coronary artery disease , angina , congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia require acute medical management . Patient known hypersensitivity Thyrogen ( human recombinant thyrotropin ) . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman ineligible ; breast feeding discontinue mother treated AZD6244 . Brain metastases spinal cord compression unless treat stable ( least 3 month ) steroid . Mean QTc interval &gt; 450 m</criteria>
