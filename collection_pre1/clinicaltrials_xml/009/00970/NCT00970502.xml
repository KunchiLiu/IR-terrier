	<brief_summary>There optimal treatment patient recurrent head neck cancer previous radiation . Chemotherapy alone curative patient survive average 6 10 month . Surgery always possible often remove every cancerous cell . On hand , reirradiation chemotherapy cure approximately 25 30 % patient significant toxicity many 15 20 % suffer life-threatening fatal complication . Therefore , less toxic effective reirradiation regimen urgently need . There extensive data animal study preliminary human study show block epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) COX-2 enhance radiation effect effective either treatment alone . Erlotinib FDA approve oral inhibitor EGFR celecoxib FDA approve COX-2 inhibitor . Both well study human appear less severe toxicity conventional chemotherapeutic agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advance treatment head neck cancer , locoregional recurrence predominant site treatment failure frequently cause death . Second primary tumor head neck occur 30 % patient 10 year follow-up eradication original tumor due field cancerization . The standard approach patient recurrent non-metastatic disease surgical salvage alone . Unfortunately , strategy feasible select group patient 5 year survival rate range 15-40 % . Most patient previously irradiate unresectable recurrent metastatic head neck cancer treat chemotherapy alone . This approach offer limited palliation response rate 10-40 % , median survival 5 10 month . While may acceptable option patient clearly incurable widespread metastatic disease , may best approach patient potentially curable locoregional disease . While geographic miss second primary tumor occur , majority patient radioresistant tumor . Therefore , reirradiation alone unlikely effective . High dose reirradiation concomitant chemotherapy represent aggressive approach result encouraging 3-year survival rate 15 35 % . This approach represent potentially curative option patient unresectable partially resected disease arise previously irradiate volume . However , high rate acute late toxicity approach limit widespread application approach . Extensive preclinical clinical data suggest epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antagonists cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor enhance effectiveness ionizing radiation . In locally advanced head neck cancer , recent phase III trial concurrent anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody radiation demonstrate improved local control , disease free survival overall survival compare radiation alone without increase mucosal toxicity associate concurrent chemotherapy . COX-2 inhibition anti-EGFR therapy demonstrate activity recurrent/metastatic head neck cancer recent phase I study . Head neck cancer represent ideal site study biologic marker tumor response accessibility tumor biopsy . Therefore , propose combination Erlotinib Celecoxib radiation cohort previously irradiation patient head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
