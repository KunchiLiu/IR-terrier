	<brief_title>A Study Determine Relative Oral Bioavailability Single Dose Administration TMC207 , Under Fed Fasted Conditions Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-panel ( 2 group ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , 3- way crossover ( method use switch participant one treatment arm another clinical study ) study . The study consist 3 phase include , screen phase ( less equal 21 day administration study medication ) , treatment phase ( 84 day ) , follow-up phase ( 30 35 day last blood sample last treatment session collect ) . Approximately 24 healthy participant allocate one two panel : Panel A ( participant receive study medication feed condition ) ; Panel B ( participant receive study medication fast condition ) . Participants Panel A randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence ( Treatment sequence ABC , ACB , BAC , BCA , CBA , CAB ) receive follow 3 formulation TMC207 food : Treatments A : Phase II tablet formulation ; Treatment B : newly develop tablet formulation fine particle size distribution ; Treatment C : newly develop tablet formulation coarse particle size distribution . Participants Panel B randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence ( Treatment sequence DEF , DFE , EDF , EFD , FDE , FED ) receive follow 3 formulation TMC207 without food : Treatments D : Phase II tablet formulation ; Treatment E : newly develop tablet formulation fine particle size distribution ; Treatment F : newly develop tablet formulation coarse particle size distribution . Subsequent treatment separate period 4 week . The total duration study participant approximately 20 week . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , electrocardiogram , physical examination , alcohol urine medicine screen monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
