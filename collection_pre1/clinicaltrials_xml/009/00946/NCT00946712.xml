	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin paclitaxel compare well work without bevacizumab and/or cetuximab treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer return period improvement ( recurrent ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bevacizumab may prevent growth new blood vessel tumor need grow . Cetuximab may also stop cancer cell grow bind interfere protein surface tumor cell need tumor growth . It yet know whether give carboplatin paclitaxel effective without bevacizumab and/or cetuximab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0819 : Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Bevacizumab and/or Cetuximab Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) entire study population . II . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) institutional review epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) -positive patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare OS PFS centralize review EGFR FISH-positive patient . II . To compare PFS centralized image review institutional review entire study population . III . To compare response rate ( confirm plus unconfirmed , complete partial response ) subset patient measurable disease EGFR FISH-positive patient entire study population . IV . To assess toxicity treatment regimen . V. To prospectively test EGFR FISH predictive marker selection patient cetuximab plus chemotherapy . III . To evaluate role V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) mutation term cetuximab efficacy . IV . To compare result EGFR FISH KRAS mutation , EGFR mutation , EGFR immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , purport EGFR-related biomarkers . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare PFS patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) IHC score &gt; 200 treated carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab ( appropriate ) without cetuximab . II . To compare OS patient advance NSCLC IHC score &gt; 200 treated carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab ( appropriate ) without cetuximab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute without bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course , patient receive bevacizumab may continue receive bevacizumab ( ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin without bevacizumab Arm I . Patients also receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course , patient may continue receive cetuximab without bevacizumab ( ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
