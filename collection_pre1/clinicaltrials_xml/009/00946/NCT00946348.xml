	<brief_title>Cannabis Schizophrenia : Self-Medication Agonist Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cannabis use disorder ( CUD ) ten time common schizophrenia ( SCZ ) general population , substantially worsen course severe psychiatric disorder . Since SCZ occur 1 % population , comorbidity CUD 13 % 42 % people disorder present society important public health problem . At present , treatment available `` dual diagnosis '' patient inadequate . New treatment limit cannabis use patient schizophrenia sorely need . While basis substance use patient SCZ clear , suggest use substance may `` self-medicate '' negative symptom side effect experience antipsychotic treatment . We propose alternative formulation `` self-medication hypothesis '' -- neurobiological formulation suggest dysregulated mesocorticolimbic `` brain reward circuit '' ( BRC ) patient SCZ underpins substance use , cannabis substance use ameliorate dysregulated circuitry . Our formulation base literature suggest reinforce effect substance abuse , include cannabis , may relate stimulation dopamine ( DA ) neuron prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) mesolimbic system , key component BRC . Thus , accord formulation , cannabis use `` medicates '' dysregulated brain reward circuitry patient SCZ allow normal response naturally reward event . Using monetary probe link fMRI , demonstrate patient SCZ co-occurring CUD ( agreement preliminary study investigator non substance abuse patient ) indeed deficit within BRC ( reduce activation nucleus accumbens ) compare normal subject . This proposal allow u directly test effect cannabis BRC patient SCZ CUD thus confirm hypothesis regard effect patient . In addition , proposal seek ass whether cannabinoid agonist dronabinol , give patient SCZ CUD , also ameliorate BRC deficit , , thus , whether dronabinol could consider potential adjunctive treatment ( give antipsychotic medication ) decrease cannabis use . The study consist two phase - Pilot Study Main Study . The Pilot Study , complete 10 `` dual diagnosis '' patient prior initiation Main Study , establish dose oral dronabinol THC concentration cannabis cigarette use subsequent Main Study . The Main Study involve 3 group subject : two group dual diagnosis patient ( SCZ co-occurring CUD ) , randomly assign one group , group healthy control patient . All subject study baseline ( T1 ) 4 day later ( T2 ) monetary probe link fMRI evaluate brain reward circuitry . At T1 subject test without intervention . At T2 , patient Groups 1 2 receive dronabinol ( placebo ) pill cannabis ( placebo cannabis ) cigarette blind fashion test . Group 1 patient receive active cannabis cigarette placebo pill ; Group 2 patient receive active dronabinol pill placebo cannabis cigarette . Multiple measure take insure safety patient use cannabis dronabinol . Group 3 ( healthy control ) receive pill cannabis cigarette serve control repeat test . Analyses ass whether baseline BRC activation different patient control group , whether use cannabis dronabinol T2 normalize activation BRC relative T1 relative control T2 .</detailed_description>

Note : We exclude current tobacco smoking ( history smoking ) normal control subject since fact cigarette smoking could select subject dysregulated BRC basis continue cigarette smoke face social convention toward nonsmoking .</criteria>
