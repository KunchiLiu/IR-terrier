	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ABT-888 give combination temozolomide treat young patient recurrent refractory CNS tumor . ABT-888 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving ABT-888 together temozolomide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABT-888 Temozolomide Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 combination temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . II . To study plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ABT-888 PARP inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) order recommend Phase 2 dose ABT-888 combination temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . III . To describe toxicity combination ABT-888 temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) prior follow ABT-888 administration . II . To assess PARP expression and/or activity tumor tissue obtain either initial diagnosis relapse . III . To determine expression and/or activity DNA repair pathway , include MGMT mismatch repair , tumor tissue , available . IV . To document , within confines phase 1 trial , radiographic tumor response ABT-888 temozolomide . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ABT-888 . Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13-26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect pharmacokinetics laboratory analysis .</detailed_description>
