	<brief_summary>Patients receive treatment advance cancer often experience co-occuring pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance relieve medication . Brief cognitive-behavioral coping strategy relaxation imagery show useful symptom individually may effective cluster co-occuring pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance . Because single cognitive-behavioral strategy n't work equally well person , provide train multiple cognitive-behavioral strategy necessary . However , oncology nurse report insufficient time often available deliver intervention exactly patient experience symptom exacerbation . This application propose patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral ( PC-CB ) intervention , use MP3 player deliver record cognitive-behavioral strategy . The PC-CB intervention would allow patient select variety cognitive-behavioral strategy base personal preference , facilitate self-administration strategy whatever time place symptom occur , without increase burden nursing staff . Primary aim ( 1 ) explore acceptability pattern use record cognitive-behavioral strategy ( 2 ) pilot test efficacy PC-CB intervention compare waitlist control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo treatment advance cancer often experience combination pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance symptom co-occur `` cluster '' within patient . Medications may effective reducing symptom ; however , often side effect exacerbate symptom . Practice guideline research evidence suggest cognitive-behavioral ( CB ) strategy may effective treatment , , side effect symptom . However , investigator yet explore effect CB strategies co-occuring pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance . It possible intervention effective one symptom may also beneficial effect co-occuring symptom . For example , control pain may permit good sleep subsequently reduce fatigue . Cognitive-behavioral strategy , however , equally effective patient , train one strategy may sufficient . Providing multiple CB strategy may efficacious , complicate fact oncology nurse report insufficient time equipment deliver intervention practice . And give patient-care demand , provide CB strategy exactly patient experience increase symptom intensity usually feasible . A patient-centered approach symptom management would allow patient select variety CB strategy base personal preference , skill , interest permit use strategy whatever time place symptom occur . The use MP3 technology deliver intervention would allow patient control delivery CB strategy without increase burden nursing staff could potentially improve symptom cluster . The purpose study conduct pilot test 2-week patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral intervention ( PC-CB intervention ) , use MP3 player deliver record CB strategy co-occurring pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance cancer treatment . Primary Aims 1 . To explore acceptability pattern use record CB strategy deliver via MP3 player among patient receive treatment advance cancer . 2 . To pilot test efficacy 2-week PC-CB intervention symptom outcomes cancer treatment compare waitlist control condition . Secondary Aims 1 . To determine change perceive control symptoms outcome expectancy mediate effect PC-CB intervention symptom outcome . 2 . To determine gender , age , image ability , concurrent symptom moderate impact PC-CB intervention symptom outcome .</detailed_description>
