	<brief_summary>The real impact cardiac surgery coronary angioplasty remain clarified , appropriate , influence factor way beneficial deleterious remain identified . The identification factor could make even faster screening , prevention therefore open therapeutic prospect patient . The objective study constitute prospective cohort ass occurrence cognitive decline cardiac surgery ( 200 patient ) coronary angioplasty ( 200 patient ) use scale Dementia rating scale ( DRS ) Mattis . In addition , investigator identify factor influence positively negatively , occurrence cognitive decline . The study base systematic monitoring clinical , biological , imaging pharmacological factor , correlate respective influence factor incidence cognitive decline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Factors Influencing Cognitive Decline Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular invasive intervention ( surgery angioplasty ) save thousand live every year , question remain neurological complication particular cognitive deficit . Indeed , cardiac surgery associate cognitive decline 50 70 % patient first postoperative week 20 40 % patient 6 month one year surgery . The study base prospective monitoring 1 year cohort 400 patient receive either cardiac surgery coronary angioplasty . At inclusion , collect medical history , risk factor , treatment history , clinical etiological data ( imaging , cardiac vascular balance ) . The result routine test perform complementary hospitalization record ( echo-doppler vessel neck , cardiac ultrasound trans-thoracic and/or transesophageal holter cardiac ) . In recruiting , apply method match base age ( 5 year ) 2 group order compare 2 homogeneous group .</detailed_description>
