	<detailed_description>Historically Potassium Iodide give patient 1 week prior thyroidectomy . This common practice use decrease thyroid function prevent thyroid storm thyroidectomy . However , modern practice , nearly patient present surgical management make euthyroid use medication propylthiouracil . Despite potassium iodine continue administer presumption decrease friability gland make surgery easy , less blood loss .
