	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : CC-4047 drug may also affect growth blood vessel support tumor growth . If blood vessel stop grow , may stop cancer cell growth . Prednisone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Prednisone often give combination chemotherapy treat cancer . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1- 28 every 28-day study `` cycle , '' take CC-4047 capsule ( ) mouth . You take capsule ( ) , time every day . The capsule ( ) open , break , chew . CC-4047 take without food , least 2 hour 2 hour meal . If dose CC-4047 miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make , rather take next scheduled time point . In order take part study , must register follow requirement POMALYST REMS™ program Celgene Corporation . This program provide education counsel risk expose unborn child study drug , risk blood clot reduce blood count . You require receive counseling , follow pregnancy test birth control requirement program appropriate , take survey regard well follow POMALYST REMS™ program . You receive prednisone mouth first 3 cycle therapy . You take 1 time day Cycle 1 . During Cycle 2 , take small dose 1 time day . During Cycle 3 , take dose Cycle 2 , 1 time every day . On Days 1-28 , also take low-dose aspirin . This take time CC-4047 . Aspirin take help prevent blood clot , may occur take CC-4047 . If unable take aspirin , study doctor take another drug . You give study `` diary '' . In diary , record take dose study drug . You return unused study drug empty bottle visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , heart rate ) weight . - You ask drug take recent blood transfusion may . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 28 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You ask drug take recent blood transfusion may . - You ask birth control method use . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask new side effect medical condition may experience . - You complete questionnaire quality-of-life well assessment possible pain spleen . ( Cycles 1 2 ) On Day 28 cycle 1,2,3 every third cycle ( Cycle 6 , 9 , ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement yur vital sign weight . - Measurements spleen and/or liver take . - You performance status evaluation . On Day 28 every sixth cycle ( Cycle 6 , 12 ) follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw test thyroid function . - You ECG . - Response disease therapy assess . Bone marrow biopsy aspirate do confirm complete response doctor think need . Pregnancy Testing : Women able child pregnancy test every week Cycle 1 , every 28 day menstrual cycle regular ( If menstrual cycle regular , blood pregnancy test every 2 week ) . These pregnancy test part routine blood draw . Length Study : You remain study treatment long therapy beneficial . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : Once study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign measurement spleen and/or liver . - You ECG . - You ask drug take blood transfusion may . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test thyroid function test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . - You ask side effect may experience . Follow-Up Visit : Women able child blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test 28 day last dose study drug . If period irregular 2 blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) pregnancy test , one 14 day last dose study drug another 28 day last dose study drug . Response disease therapy assess follow-up 28 day last dose study drug . This investigational study . CC-4047 ( pomalidomide ) FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type MM . Its use study investigational . Prednisone FDA approve commercially available . Up 70 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
