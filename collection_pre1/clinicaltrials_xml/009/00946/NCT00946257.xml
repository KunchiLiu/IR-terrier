	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Administration Otelixizumab T1DM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Otelixizumab humanize , aglycosyl , non-mitogenic , anti CD3 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) direct Îµ domain human lymphocyte antigen CD3 , currently undergo phase III clinical trial adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patient evaluate rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis patient small exploratory study . In previous study , otelixizumab administer intravenous infusion . This study randomise , single-blind , placebo-controlled , study otelixizumab administer subcutaneously Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) subject . The assessment otelixizumab T1DM subject provide safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic information follow subcutaneous administration enable identification appropriate safe well-tolerated subcutaneous dosage regimen use subsequent clinical study . This study consist screen phase , follow in-house phase whereby otelixizumab administer cohort stagger dose level . Approximately 6 dose level , cover 10-fold dose range , evaluate . A single subcutaneous dose otelixizumab administer Day 1 , serial blood sample obtain clinical laboratory testing , determination pharmacodynamic marker , serum otelixizumab PK parameter , immunogenicity . Safety pharmacodynamic data previous dose ( ) evaluate prior dose escalation modification ensure safety achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology . Adverse event , laboratory value , vital sign ECG 's monitor closely study . All subject study undergo long-term follow-up 48 month monitor ensure patient safety .</detailed_description>
