	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate score tool help determine presence Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , adverse reaction heparin . We hypothesize score tool useful exclude patient suspect HIT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating 4Ts Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia ( HIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIT immune response heparin result thrombogenic thrombocytopenia . It often difficult diagnosis make , diagnosis dependent upon clinical serologic criterion . Due ambiguity , increase test treatment may occur serologic test result return . Recently , score tool develop assist diagnosis disease . However , score tool yet validate . Thus , plan conduct prospective , observational study validate two scoring tool , 4Ts Chong scale , diagnosis HIT . In order validate scoring tool , two physician independently score 4Ts Chong scale patient suspect HIT . These patient identify physician order HIT antibody test use enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) method . Confirmatory test serotonin release assay ( SRA ) also perform .</detailed_description>
