	<detailed_description>Studies correlate metabolic syndrome several illness publish , especially affection associated atherosclerosis , like coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease peripheral arterial disease . The term peripheral arterial disease , however , refers several stage development atherosclerosis extremity , comprise since asymptomatic patient far individual critical ischemia . Intermittent claudication symptom early stage atherosclerosis , medical intervention may still prevent progression disease . Despite importance precocious diagnosis metabolic syndrome initiate adequate treatment , prevalence among patient well determined literature . This big casuistic literature far know .</detailed_description>
