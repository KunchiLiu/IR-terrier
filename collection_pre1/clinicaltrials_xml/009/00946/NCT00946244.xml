	<brief_summary>The main purpose study extend investigator ' previous research longitudinally examine effectiveness three early intervention program : usual care program , clinic-based intervention program home-based intervention program low birth weight preterm child 3 4 year age . Normal weight full-term child also include serve reference group . Effectiveness assessment include child , parent , transaction measure . Child outcome measure include health status , growth , neurodevelopment behavior ; parent outcome measure include parental stress , competence , efficacy family support ; transaction outcome measure include parent-child interaction procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Effectiveness Early Intervention Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulating data early intervention preterm infant illustrate short-term benefit enhance child development decrease parental stress , particularly heavier birth weight . However , rare study design early intervention program small preterm infant longitudinally examine effectiveness various outcome domain . Our research team recently conduct clinical randomization trial effectiveness three early intervention program : usual care program ( UCP ) , clinic-based intervention program ( CBIP ) home-based intervention program ( HBIP ) low birth weight ( VLBW , birth weight &lt; 1,500 g ) preterm infant neonatal period two year correct age ( CA ) . The latter two comprehensive , intensive intervention program combine child- parent-focused service begin hospitalization end one year CA deliver clinic home respectively . This three-year research project extend previous work longitudinally examine effectiveness three intervention program 180 VLBW preterm infant 3 4 year age . Sixty full-term infant also include serve reference group . Outcome measure include child ( i.e. , health , growth , neurodevelopment behavior ) , parent ( i.e. , parental stress , competency , efficacy family support ) mother-child transaction ( i.e. , free-play frustrating episode ) . The longitudinal data effectiveness early intervention program VLBW preterm infant provide important information help early intervention professional public policy maker develop effective intervention preterm child risk developmental problem .</detailed_description>
