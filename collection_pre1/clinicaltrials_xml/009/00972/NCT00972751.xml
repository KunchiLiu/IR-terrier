	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine expression level thioredoxin-1 ( Trx-1 ) , thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP ) , hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF-1α ) paraffin-embedded resected tumor tissue sample patient stage II III rectal cancer enrol clinical trial SWOG-9304 . - Determine correlation Trx-1 TXNIP expression HIF-1α expression . - Correlate expression protein tumor stage , disease-free survival , overall survival , risk recurrence . - Determine interaction patient age , performance status , type therapy receive clinical trial SWOG-9304 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Paraffin-embedded resect tumor tissue sample analyze protein expression level ( thioredoxin-1 , thioredoxin-interacting protein , hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha ) tissue microarray immunostaining .</detailed_description>
