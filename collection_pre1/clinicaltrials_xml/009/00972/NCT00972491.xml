	<brief_summary>Laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) routinely use patient surgery general anesthesia . LMA place mouth allow anesthesia give without put breathe tube throat . Previous study focus effect different anesthesia medicine optimal condition LMA use . The objective present study find optimal time LMA insertion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optimal Time Put Laryngeal Mask Airway Mouth Under General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , blind trial . Midazolam , 2 mg fentanyl 1.0 Âµg/kg , would give prior induction propofol , 2.5 mg/kg . The investigator induction general anesthesia also responsible timekeeping . For reason , possible investigator blind randomization . The induction would conclude loss eyelash reflex ( LER ) . At point insertion LMA ( # 4 female , # 5 male ) occur 0 , 60 90 second LER . The LMA lubricate water soluble gel insert deflate cuff accord technique describe Brain . The investigator insert LMA ( Inv1 ) operating room blind randomization group see induction general anesthesia . This investigator insert LMA call investigator induces general anesthesia ( Inv2 ) . Inv1 also grade ease LMA insertion . The primary outcome Jaw opening time LMA insertion , define full 1 , partial 2 , nil 3 . Secondary outcome include : 1 . Insertion LMA ( easy , difficult , impossible ) 2 . Coughing gagging ( none , , significant ) 3 . Head body movement ( none , , significant ) 4 . Laryngospasm airway obstruction ( none , partial , total )</detailed_description>
