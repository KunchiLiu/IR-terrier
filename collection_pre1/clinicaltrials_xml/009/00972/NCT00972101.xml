	<brief_title>Infusion Expanded Cord Blood T Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood source stem cell use transplantation . The major problem type transplant small number stem cell available cord blood . This delay recipients body 's ability accept cord blood . This may also cause immune system slow , make infection likely . One method help fix problem treat sample cord blood growth factor , may promote growth need T cell give recipient transplant . For study , participant receive high-dose chemotherapy , untreated cord blood cell transplant , 14 day later receive treat cord blood cell transplant . The Study Drugs : Melphalan design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Thiotepa design damage DNA , may cause cancer cell die Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA . This may increase likelihood cell die . Rituximab design attach specific protein surface tumor cell , may cause die . Etoposide design block cell growth . Filgrastim drug help cell bone marrow divide Anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) drug help immune system attach inactivate T cell . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) drug suppress immune system . Tacrolimus drug help immune system prevent GVHD . IL-2 protein use help growth T cell . Placement Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : Before back-up stem cell collect receive chemotherapy , require CVC , sterile flexible tube , place large vein upper chest local anesthesia . Children usually unable hold still procedure give drug make sleep procedure . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . If donate back-up cell ( describe ) catheter place day collection . If donate back cell , CVC place day admission hospital . This catheter use draw blood , give fluid , give study drug . Collection `` back '' stem cell : Collection additional stem cell donor cord blood possible transplant cord blood fails . Back-up blood additional bone marrow collect frozen week high-dose chemotherapy begin . The study doctor decide collect collect sample base status disease . The sample ( ) collect leukapheresis bone marrow aspirate . Selection another donor alternate source stem cell If cord blood transplant successful , receive back-up cell collect admission describe . If unable donate stem cell , example contamination tumor cell , family member second cord blood transplant use . The potential family member donor screening test perform find eligible donate stem cell . Leukapheresis : If donate back-up stem cell , collection blood stem cell , treat drug call filgrastim , make stem cell marrow easy study doctor collect help increase number white blood cell . This drug give needle skin 1-2 time day 3-7 day . When white cell count high enough ( usually around day 4 ) , blood stem cell collect CVC 3-4 hours/day . The collection process repeat daily enough stem cell collect . You continue receive filgrastim stem cell collect . Bone Marrow Collection : If leukapheresis perform successfully , example white blood cell count increase enough filgrastim , bone marrow collect . You go operate room asleep . Multiple small bone marrow aspirate perform marrow collect . Only small sample bone marrow ( le 5 % ) take . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . High-Dose Chemotherapy Administration : Day 0 day stem cell transplant , negative day number use describe treatment day transplant . All chemotherapy , fluid , drug must give vein infuse CVC . After `` backup '' stem cell collect , admitted hospital Day -9 begin receive fluid . Chemotherapy may stop intolerable side effect occur . You place 1 2 treatment group . The study doctor decide treatment group best treatment . If Group 1 , receive chemotherapy cord blood transfusion . If Group 2 , receive treatment chemotherapy , radiation , cord blood transfusion . - If Group 1 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute single dose Day -8 , thiotepa vein 4 hour single dose Day -7 , follow fludarabine vein 30 minute 1 time day Days -6 -3 . Rituximab may give vein 4 - 6 hour Day -9 doctor think necessary . - If Group 2 , receive radiation Days -7 , -6 , -5 -4 . You sign separate consent total body irradiation . Then give etoposide vein 1-2 hour single dose Day -3 . Rituximab may give vein 4-6 hour Day -8 doctor think necessary . - Group 1 receive anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) vein 4-6 hour Days -4 -3 treatment low chance cord blood infusion reject . - Group 2 receive anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) vein 4-6 hour Days -3 , -2 , -1 treatment low chance cord blood infusion reject . Cord Blood Infusion : After chemotherapy treatment , total body irradiation ( Group 2 ) , cord blood unit thaw . The large portion cord blood infuse CVC . A small portion cell expand describe . Expansion Cord Blood T Cells : On Day 0 , small unit cord blood treat M. D. Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory IL-2 vitamin-like growth factor produce need T cell . At time , clinical bead use help separate expand T cell . This take 2 week . On Day 14 , give treat cord blood infusion CVC . Infusion Back-Up Cells : In case stem cell transplant reject immune system , researcher unable collect sample stem cell , unrelated donor second cord transplant use . The cord blood treat use CliniMACs processing device . Mouse protein antibody use CliniMACs processing procedure . Recipients pre-existing immunity protein may risk allergic reaction infusion process cell . Epinephrine antihistamines available recipient 's bedside peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBSC ) infusion help treat allergic reaction . Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) Preventive Therapy : GVHD may result transplanted cord blood cell react certain tissue body . In attempt prevent decrease severity GVHD , receive 2 drug ( MMF tacrolimus ) . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) pills give start 3 day cord blood transplant , continue Day 100 transplant . If take pill , drug give CVC . If develop GVHD , may continue take MMF Day 100 . Tacrolimus give 2 day transplant 24 hour continuous infusion several week . After stem cell transplant able eat drink , tacrolimus give mouth 2 time day 6 month . The number tacrolimus pill may vary depend level drug blood , usually give 1-3 pill time . If able swallow pill , liquid form drug available . This drug use 6-9 month longer chronic GVHD occurs . Length Study : You monitor closely first 100 day receive transplant periodically . You may remain study long disease return experience intolerable side effect . Your participation clinical trial may end time reason . Follow-Up Visits After Transplant : After leave hospital , come back regular visit clinic M. D. Anderson . How often follow-up visit may vary , may often daily . Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . The number blood and/or urine test may also vary , may perform daily . You bone marrow aspirate collect transplant , 30 day transplant , every 3 month first year transplant . After , bone marrow sample collect 1 time year long doctor think necessary . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area bone numb anaesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Patients lymphomas Hodgkin 's disease need CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform within 30 day transplant , 100 day transplant , every 3 month first year . After , do 1 time every year long doctor think necessary . This investigational study . The clinical bead use study may produce either University Pennsylvania Invitrogen Corporation . All study drug FDA approve commercially available treatment adult . These drug alone combination FDA approve treatment child use study consider experimental . The CliniMACS processing device use process cell backup infusion FDA approve use . Up 18 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
