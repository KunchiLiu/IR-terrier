	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Raptiva® compare placebo control moderate severe chronic plaque psoriasis involve palm and/or sol score Palmo-plantar Pustular Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PPPASI ) ≥5 subject candidate phototherapy systemic therapy . The rational trial psoriasis involve palm and/or sol painful condition associate fissuring , scale instance pustulation . Because localization , disable condition limit dexterity affect social interaction , lead compromise quality life ; confers additional severity plaque psoriasis body . The therapeutic approach palm sole plaque-type psoriasis usually begin topical corticosteroid treatment . If disease reach certain extent , next step involve addition systemic treatment . Substances like methotrexate , retinoids cyclosporine show efficacious , long-term usage often limited toxicity . Biologic treatment psoriasis avoid toxicity offer new therapeutic approach . The therapeutic potential Raptiva® treat palm sole psoriasis refractory systemic treatment describe numerous case report one placebo-controlled phase IV study . However , case , number subject include low , case trial prospectively design . Since efficacy Raptiva® psoriasis palm sol must determine use validate PPPASI measure , necessary scientific ethical reason include placebo arm first 12 week . Finally , clinical response may sometimes take long 12 week , subject must treat evaluated additional 12-week open-label extend treatment period .</brief_summary>
