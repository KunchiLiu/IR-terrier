	<brief_summary>Ipilimumab manufacture monoclonal antibody , much like antibody usually make human body fight infection ; however know human body `` fight '' cancerous tumor . The idea behind develop experimental drug stimulate immune system make antibody kill cancer cell . This research study consider `` experimental '' receive approval Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment type cancer . This monoclonal antibody specifically make block Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) , protein find cell immune system . CTLA4 seem slow immune response , block anti-CTLA4 antibody may make immune response active . The purpose study see Ipilimumab affect response patient 's immune system toward cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willing able give write informed consent . Histologic diagnosis melanoma belong T14 N1b,2b,2c,3 M 0 AJCC stage , may present follow group : Primary melanoma clinically apparent ( overt ) regional lymph node metastasis , confirm pathological diagnosis ( biopsy ) . Clinically detected recurrence melanoma proximal regional lymph node ( ) basin , confirm pathological diagnosis ( biopsy ) . Clinically histologically detect primary melanoma involve multiple regional nodal group , confirm pathological diagnosis ( biopsy ) . Clinically detect single site nodal metastatic melanoma arise unknown primary , confirmed pathological diagnosis ( biopsy ) . Patients eligible trial either presentation primary melanoma concurrent regional nodal metastasis , time clinically detect nodal recurrence . Patients must undergo biopsy ( punch ) open biopsy ( do part clinically indicated baseline diagnostic procedure ) within 14 day entry study . Lymphadenectomy perform least 2 generally longer 4 week ipilimumab therapy . Additional delay definitive lymphadenectomy allow clinically indicate await resolution potential adverse event ipilimumab therapy . Patients must evaluate standardofcare full body image study ( CT , PETCT MRI ) part initial clinical workup baseline ( 4 week prior study enrollment ) completion 2 dos ipilimumab ( 68 week first dose ipilimumab prior definitive lymphadenectomy procedure ) . Required value initial laboratory test : White Blood Cell ≥ 3000/uL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/uL Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL Creatinine ≤ ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ ULN , ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) PT/PTT ≤ ULN ( No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. ) Adequate performance status ( ECOG 0 , 1 ) . Men woman , ≥ 18 year age . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must willing use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 8 week last dose ipilimumab . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization procedure ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define : Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour start ipilimumab . Patients clinical , radiological/laboratory , pathological evidence distant metastatic disease . Patients evidence soft tissue involvement gross extranodal extension tumor manifest fixation fascia , mat nodal tissue would compromise surgical resection determine surgical oncologist . Patients history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , GI obstruction abdominal carcinomatosis know risk factor bowel perforation . Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 5 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ eg , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome ) . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator make administration ipilimumab hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . Patients underlying heart condition deem ineligible surgery cardiology consult . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 1 month dose ipilimumab ) . A history prior treatment ipilimumab prior CD137 agonist CTLA4 inhibitor agonist . A history prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , include infusion perfusion therapy current disease immunotherapy include tumor vaccine , interferonalfa , interleukin , levamisole biologic response modifier within past 4 week . Concomitant therapy following : IL 2 , interferon , nonstudy immunotherapy regimen ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ; unless discontinue ≥ 4 week . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define Section 4.1 , : unwilling unable use acceptable method contraception avoid pregnancy entire study period least 8 week cessation study drug , positive pregnancy test baseline , pregnant breastfeeding . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious ) illness . Before study enrollment , WOCBP must advise importance avoid pregnancy study participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test first receive ipilimumab . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive ipilimumab must enrol study .</criteria>
