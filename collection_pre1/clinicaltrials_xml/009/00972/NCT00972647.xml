	<brief_summary>Introduction : The orthopaedic surgeon frequently expose ionize radiation , especially intraoperative fluoroscopy . It expect use laser guide fluoroscopy technique , improve accuracy radiography , also reduce amount time exposure radiation . Finally , literature appear controversial matter clear conclusion could draw . Hypothesis : The test hypothesis use laser-aiming device fluoroscopy several orthopaedic procedure reduce exposure patient surgeon damage effect radiation . The null hypothesis state difference exposure radiation group use laser device group use apparatus . Methods : A prospective randomized control trial performed patient undergo fluoroscopy randomly allocate two group . One group undergo image use device throughout procedure group undergo radiation without laser guide device . Number time exposure record procedure . It utmost importance complexity procedure remain relatively similar . It believe good measure complexity surgical time . Therefore , procedure statistically similar set mean ( p &gt; 0.05 ) would include study . It also important one two surgeon similar expertise year experience perform surgery avoid confound factor . It expect throughout duration study ( 8 week ) 50-100 case would report would produce statistically significant result . The result analyze calculate confidence interval difference mean continuous data significance level Student 's test . Statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . Risks Benefits : This study involve minimal risk . The use laser guide increase introduce risk associate inherent surgical risk . The risk usually associate type study concern breach confidentiality . To reduce risk , research number assign subject ' data collect procedure , whose personal information find another password-protected database . This study help investigator investigate technique may help reduce amount time patient expose radiation .</brief_summary>
