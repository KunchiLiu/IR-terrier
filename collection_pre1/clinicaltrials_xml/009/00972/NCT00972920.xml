	<detailed_description>Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block application local anaesthetic solution plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle triangle Petit locate superiorly iliac crest bilaterally . Anterior division segmental spinal nerve , provide innervation abdominal wall , run inside compartment . The TAP block show provide good postoperative pain relief follow surgical laparotomy , gynaecological laparotomy , appendicectomy , inguinal hernia repair open prostatectomy . It also reduce post operative morphine consumption see procedure . This allow comfortable recovery reduce incidence nausea vomiting , well potentially early mobilisation discharge . Currently technique employ first describe Mc Donnell . This involve blind 'two pop ' technique signify needle pass two muscle layer . On detection two pop local anaesthetic inject plane muscle layer . It anaesthetise nerve muscle plane aide post operative pain relief much 24 hour . TAP nerve block become common practice due low report complication rate occur use 'blind technique ' . Such complication minor . It hope complication reduce use ultrasound guide technique . The use ultrasound machine would allow direct visualisation needle progress tissue muscle layer . It would confirm correct position infiltration local anaesthetic prevent inadvertent puncture organ entry abdominal space . Studies show commonly use nerve block , introduction ultrasound guide technique improve efficacy nerve block . We hope show similar trend use ultrasound guide technique insertion TAP block . Trials underway compare different dosage volume regime , knowledge trial comparing use ultrasound machine conventional 'blind ' technique order ass pain relief morphine consumption post operatively . Only recently ultrasound machine become commonplace anaesthetic department , feel research show valuable contribution patient comfort subgroup patient undergoing abdominal gynaecological procedure . We wish ass whether achieve well patient satisfaction , less morphine consumption ultimately short hospital stay ultrasound technique compare blind technique .</detailed_description>
