	<brief_summary>The purpose study utilize cardiac imaging data acquire part standard care patient , MRI , 3D echo , CT , exist 3D reconstruction protocol assess feasibility use surgical planning treatment patient complex cardiac defect . The specific aim project follow : 1 . Develop protocol reconstruct heart model patient image data perform `` virtual '' surgery reconstruct 3D anatomy use appropriate , pre-existing patient datasets . 2 . Use develop protocol prospectively plan evaluate possible surgical option new patient . 3 . Validate optimal virtual anatomy agree surgically implement use post-operative patient scan , available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Planning Reconstruction Complex Heart Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , approximately 1 200 baby bear year harmful congenital heart defect ( CHD ) require form medical management . Often , defect consist hole septum ( wall heart chamber ) and/or abnormal development heart chamber major blood vessel . Surgery primary treatment course many patient , use patch artificial vessel , often possible repair defect recreate normal blood flow path heart . These technique always simple , however , surgeon must take great care harm pump function heart . In complex case , surgeon must decide multiple repair strategy major effect long-term health patient . It would helpful case surgeon able ass repair option prior operation use virtual 3-dimensional representation patient 's anatomy . Having ability would remove uncertainty decision-making process provide accurate prediction post-surgical anatomy . In fact , technology exists include surgical planning tool standard treatment course patient . Using 3D anatomical image , acquire basic , technique magnetic resonance ( MR ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , echocardiography , engineer Georgia Tech ability build accurate 3D model patient anatomy , heart . Using model state-of-the-art graphic manipulation tool , surgeon would ability virtually operate patient select optimal treatment approach , previously discuss . Similar technique already develop used plan surgery limit subset CHD patient single ventricle physiology . The purpose study develop technique apply broad range CHD patient . To , patient undergo appropriate surgical repair recruit participate study . Images obtain pre-operative scan use build anatomical model , surgeon manipulate test different available option . By successfully test eventually implement technique standard care CHD patient , optimal approach reconstruction implement frequently , thus patient outcome improve .</detailed_description>
