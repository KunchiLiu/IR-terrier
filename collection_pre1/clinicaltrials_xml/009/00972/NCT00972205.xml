	<brief_summary>Background : - Some cancer cell large amount protein call P-glycoprotein , pump certain chemotherapy drug cell . This pump may part reason difficult shrink cancer chemotherapy . - In laboratory experiment , drug CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) block P-glycoprotein pump , result accumulation high amount chemotherapy inside cancer cell , make chemotherapy effective . - Paclitaxel cancer drug cause tumor shrink many type cancer , include lung , ovarian , breast , renal , cervical others . Objectives : - To determine whether CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) block P-glycoprotein pump cancer cell whether inhibits action pump find normal blood cell liver tissue . - To evaluate effectiveness combination therapy use CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) paclitaxel treat solid tumor determine whether two drug together effective paclitaxel alone . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age solid tumor treat successfully standard treatment . Design : -Patients receive CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) paclitaxel 21-day cycle . Treatment continue two cycle cancer go , decide surgically remove remain cancer , cancer grow point define progressive disease . For cycle , patient take CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) mouth three divided dos daily 7 day . On day 6 , paclitaxel give vein 3 hour . Blood test do start CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) repeat periodically throughout treatment . Imaging study compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ( CT MRI ) do every two cycle . In addition , first cycle , patient undergo image tumor normal tissue 99mTc-sestamibi radionuclide scan administration CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) . This scan help show well P-glycoprotein pump block treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : This pharmacodynamic study aim evaluate efficacy CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) modulator Pgp-mediated drug efflux patient tumor normal tissue . The study build decade experience 99mTc-sestamibi imaging rhodamine accumulation efflux normal circulate CD56 plus cell surrogates Pgp function . CBA Research , Inc. , carry Phase I II test CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) drug resistance reversal agent , yet confirm inhibitor able block drug efflux . Objectives : Evaluate impact CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) hepatic accumulation retention 99mTc-sestamibi patient relapsed refractory solid tumor malignancy . Evaluate impact CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux CD56 plus peripheral mononuclear cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age histologic confirmation relapsed/refractory cancer , follow least standard treatment regimen , know standard therapy option capable extend life expectancy . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 2 good , hematologic , renal , hepatic , metabolic parameter suggestive adequate organ function . Design : Patients treat accord CBA Research Phase II trial CBT-1 Taxol . Patients begin protocol treatment orally administer CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) two three divide dos daily 7 day . On day 6 , 135 mg/m^2 paclitaxel administer intravenous infusion 3 hour . Prior initiation CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) , Day 6 , patient undergo blood sample rhodamine assay CD56 plus circulate mononuclear cell . In addition , patient undergo image tumor normal tissue 99mTc-sestamibi radionuclide scan . These two assay show convincing inhibition Pgp-mediated drug efflux past study Pgp inhibitor tariquidar valspodar . Twelve patient plan enrollment study , power determine difference control scan post-treatment scan compare CBT-1 ( Registered Trademark ) previous inhibitor test intramural program .</detailed_description>

Patients must agree effective method contraception study ( abstinence , hormonal barrier method birth control , condom ) study 30 day completion protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The following patient population eligible study : 1 . Women childbearing potential potentially fertile men exclude unless use effective contraception ( ie . barrier intrauterine device ( IUD ) , birth control pill , condom ) , treatment . Women pregnant nursing also exclude . 2 . Patients significant intercurrent disease . 3 . Human Immunodeficiencey virus ( HIV ) seropositive patient . Note : There may impact CBT1 pharmacokinetics drug use therapy HIV . 4 . Ongoing serious infection require parenteral antibiotic . 5 . Patients significant central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , include history seizure within last 3 month psychiatric history would impair ability give inform consent prevent compliance protocol requirement . 6 .
