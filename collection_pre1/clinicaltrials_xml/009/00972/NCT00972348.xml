	<detailed_description>HIV/AIDS non-curable chronic illness . Applying chronic care model ( CCM ) disease may lead improved outpatient base health care easier clinical transition HIV infect patient . Clinical information system ( CIS ) key element CCM three important role : reminder system ; feedback mechanism ; registry . CIS focus provider recipient critical data , however clinical information system target patient consumer information might also contribute improved health care , especially ambulatory patient . Personal health record ( PHRs ) tool would fit clinical information system patient . PHRs allow patient ( others ) view data necessary guide practical outpatient decision . PHRs become platform support CIS element , allow patient receive understand information , engage healthcare influence health outcome . Our central hypothesis secure enhance PHR ( ePHR ) combine meaningful information , web-based tool support reminder patient also provide substantial opportunity promote self-management lead improve health outcome . In proposal work directly HIV/AIDS patient public health set model process contribute improve health outcome realms patient behavior , patient-clinician trust , clinical outcome , medication safety utilization . Accordingly , specific aim : 1 . ( Build Infrastructure Content ) Extend secure web-based PHR HIV/AIDS patient receive care public health set provide user tools access understand medical record include resource decision support , information retrieval communication . Specific content include access support tobacco cessation , depression abatement , anxiety reduction , medication adherence improvement . 2 . ( Evaluation PHR ) Evaluation patient clinician experience PHR include patient access use pattern include use support tobacco cessation , depression abatement , anxiety reduction , adherence improvement. , patient clinician satisfaction ePHR . 3 . ( Outcome Assessment ) Evaluation 5 domain : quality patient-clinician interaction ( trust , communication , health promotion ) ; change patient behavior ( risk behavior , adherence antiretroviral medication , tobacco use ) ; clinical outcome ( CD4+ T-lymphocytes , detectable plasma HIV RNA , depression , anxiety , quality life ) ; safety ( documentation drug allergy , adverse event , medication reconciliation ) ; utilization ( office visit ) .</detailed_description>
