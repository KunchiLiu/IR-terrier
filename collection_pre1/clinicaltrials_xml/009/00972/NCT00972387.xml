	<brief_title>Carbohydrate-Protein Supplementation During Endurance Running</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether performance benefit consume carbohydrate-protein ( CHO-P ) supplement , Accelerade , endurance exercise , oppose traditionally use carbohydrate ( CHO ) supplement , Gatorade , attribute extra calorie CHO-P supplement presence protein alone comparison CHO supplement . Numerous study compare CHO CHO-P supplement endurance performance find contradict result term CHO-P supplementation performance benefit . While physiological mechanism propose CHO-P supplement elicit great performance , research yet determine study find , especially study find performance benefit CHO-P supplementation . This inconsistency research may due caloric difference supplement test ; due addition protein , CHO-P supplement contain calorie per serve CHO supplement . As result , study compare 4 different supplement endurance exercise , CHO-P supplement , CHO supplement , double carbohydrate supplement ( CHO-CHO ) , placebo ( PLA ) . The CHO CHO-P supplement match CHO content , whereas CHO-P CHO-CHO supplement match total caloric content . Participants ask run four 12-mile run 4 separate occasion , approximately 7-10 day apart , blind supplement content order supplement administration among trial . The 12-mile run elicit exercise bout great 60 minute , relevant supplement exercise CHO CHO-P . Performance assess via time take complete 12-mile run 1.6 mile maximal effort end run .</detailed_description>
