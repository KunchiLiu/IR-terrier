	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treat Extensive Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) one main limitation successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , substantial impact survival also quality life otherwise cancer-free patient . Half patient undergo HLA-identical allograft survive beyond 100 day may require long-term immunosuppressive treatment extensive chronic GVHD , often 2 year . More one-third patient chronic GVHD respond first-line therapy , often involve combination corticosteroid calcineurin inhibitor . There standard second-line salvage therapy patient poor outcome . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cell differentiate various lineage use repair injured tissue . Recently , MSCs also show unique immunomodulatory property ex-vivo , include inhibition T-cell proliferation stimulation allo-antigens mitogen , prevention activity cytotoxic T cells.MSCs use prophylaxis acute GVHD treatment patient steroid-refractory acute GVHD , rarely use extensive chronic GVHD . Development new therapeutic agent strategy rescue patient extensive chronic GVHD would provide significant benefit area unmet medical need . In study , single center randomize , non blind Phase II clinical trial propose study safety efficacy mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) management extensive chronic GVHD newly refractory usual therapeutic measure . Expanded MSC infuse dose 2 million cells/kg twice week 2 week weekly follow two week ( six dos totally ) patient base first-line therapy ( steroid plus cyclosporin A ) primary immunosuppressive therapy .</detailed_description>
