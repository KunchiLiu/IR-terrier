	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find distinguish cancerous non-cancerous breast cancer cell edge tumor . Using FDA approve device remove tumor , device test see cause less tissue damage therefore make easy examine tumor make sure excise . The tumor excise standard surgical technique , effect device remove tissue study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Surgical Excision Margins Malignant Breast Lumpectomies With PEAK PlasmaBlade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast conservation therapy ( BCT ) standard surgical treatment breast cancer . The goal BCT total excision malignant lesion simultaneously preserve cosmetic appearance functionality breast . Despite advance technique pathologic analysis ; however , 20-50 % malignant breast lump excision cancer present edge excision margin ( define `` positive '' margin ) . Excisions find margin positive require secondary excision ; however , case residual disease find present 40-70 % case . Some researcher hypothesize re-excision unnecessary certain percentage case . Currently routinely utilize method intra-operative interpretation surgical margin . Touch prep imprint cytology use past center use routinely experienced cytopathologist need correctly interpret slide . The standard care evaluate surgical margin base permanent section . Margins consider negative great 1 mm normal tissue cancer cell excise surface . Many factor discrepancy postulate , include artifact associate ink process electrosurgery induced damage margin excision ( thermal injury ) ; therefore , create `` false positive '' impression tumor cell present surgical margin . We propose clinical study evaluate effect thermal injury breast cancer excision use traditional electrosurgery ( i.e. , `` Bovie '' ) compare pulsed RF technology PEAK PlasmaBlade . We hypothesize PlasmaBlade impart less thermal injury incise breast tissue ( malignant normal ) increase specificity margin status . The majority breast cancer remove traditional electrocautery . We start utilize new technology soft tissue dissection UCSD . The PEAK PlasmaBlade family disposable surgical cut coagulation device offer exact control scalpel bleed control traditional electrosurgery without extensive collateral damage . The PlasmaBlade base proprietary pulse plasma technology . This technology represent evolutionary leap advancement radiofrequency surgical technology , originate traditional electrosurgery progress plasma-mediated energy device . The PlasmaBlade tissue dissection device FDA-cleared commercially available .</detailed_description>
