	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect combination bortezomib tipifarnib . Bortezomib ( VELCADE ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . Tipifarnib yet approve FDA investigational drug . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . Because drug use together , clear dose agent optimal use combination . This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . The investigator test safety BORTEZOMIB TIPIFARNIB together see effect ( good bad ) MULTIPLE MYELOMA , find high dose agent give without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients include study must meet criterion relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Relapsed myeloma define patient increase MSpike plasmacytoma compare previous measurement confirm least two different setting . Refractory myeloma define progression disease current therapy , receive least two course treatment without use high dose therapy autologous transplant . Patients must receive least 2 prior line therapy order eligible treatment . Must ≥ 18 year age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use bortezomib combination tipifarnib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric phase 1 combination trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≥ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 1,000/microliter ( mcL ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mcL Platelets ≥ 25,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ 2.5 OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² patient creatinine level institutional normal . Eligibility patient receive medication substance potential known affect activity pharmacokinetics bortezomib tipifarnib determine follow review case Principal Investigator . Patients must bisphosphonates therapy unless preclude osteonecrosis jaw ( ONJ ) clinical circumstance investigator discretion . Patients may receive erythroid growth factor need , per institutional guideline . Patients receive enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( e.g. , phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital ) cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inducer rifampin St. John 's wort . The effect bortezomib tipifarnib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior enter study . Adequate contraception include hormonal therapy , barrier method birth control abstinence . Appropriate contraception must use duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately , immediately discontinue study . Any woman become pregnant study follow throughout pregnancy outcome ( i.e . delivery , still birth , miscarriage ) . Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . Male subject agrees use acceptable method contraception duration study . Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition boronic acid , bortezomib , tipifarnib , agent use study . Known allergy imidazole drug , clotrimazole , ketoconazole , miconazole , econazole , fenticonazole , isoconazole , sulconazole , tioconazole terconazole . Patients poorly control intercurrent illness exclude include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social climate would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study bortezomib tipifarnib Class D agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother bortezomib tipifarnib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated bortezomib tipifarnib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction bortezomib tipifarnib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Other Exclusion Criteria Patient ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 day enrollment . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment . Patient hypersensitivity boron mannitol . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum ßhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( ßhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Patient receive investigational drug 14 day enrollment . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical trial .</criteria>
