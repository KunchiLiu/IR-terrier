	<brief_summary>The investigator compare three different method test infection commonly find woman . The infection cause bacterium call Group B Streptococcus . About 10−30 % woman carry GBS vagina rectum . During labour infection pass neonate . This lead baby develop serious infection . However , research show antibiotic treatment give GBS carry woman labour infection avoid . A new bedside test know PCR show produce GBS diagnostic result less hour . In clinical trial conduct US France method show accurate either prenatal vaginal swab risk factor assessment . For reason , PCR may helpful screen treat GBS positive woman UK . In study investigator compare follow three method diagnosis gold standard . - Prenatal vaginal culture swab ( 35 37 week gestation ) − The US approach . - Risk factor assessment ( time admission labour ) − The UK approach - The new PCR test ( time labour admission ) The investigator compare accuracy method accurate method determine GBS status labour . This 'most accurate ' method highly sensitive swab test unfortunately take several day produce result . For reason test tell investigator whether prophylactic antibiotic may useful labour ( Receiving birth ineffective ) . If PCR show accurate method identify GBS positive woman may help reduce number infection new born infant result may help save life .</brief_summary>
