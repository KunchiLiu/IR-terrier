	<brief_summary>This placebo-controlled crossover study intend measure effect three , common neuroactive medication brain activity measure magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . This study conduct MEG EEG scan well simple cognition test 15 healthy volunteer 4 study day . Subjects receive placebo one study day , either 100 mg modafinil p.o. , 20 mg methylphenidate p.o. , 1 mg lorazepam p.o . remain study day . Medication administration randomize accord study day subject receive medication random order . Brain activity measure MEG EEG subject total 4 time study day : prior medication administration 2 , 4 , 6 hour medication administration . Cognition test perform pre-medication baseline immediately post-medication scan time . This study test hypothesis change brain functional activity accurately measure healthy volunteer subject single , acute dos modafinil , methylphenidate lorazepam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effect Three Neuroactive Drugs Measured Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , Electroencephalography ( EEG ) Synchronous Neural Interaction Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use placebo-controlled , crossover design investigate effect modafinil ( 100 mg , p.o . ) , methylphenidate ( 20 mg , p.o . ) , lorazepam ( 1 mg , p.o . ) 15 healthy male volunteer . The acute effect medication measure MEG , EEG simple cognition test . Study procedures perform 5 separate day . During initial screen visit , Study Day 1 , subject consent enroll undergo clinical evaluation sufficient determine eligible participate study . Upon qualification enrollment , subject randomly assign receive either placebo one active medication Study Days 2 - 5 . Medications placebo administer orally . Subjects arrive MEG center morning Study Day 2 baseline MEG EEG scan perform along baseline cognition test . The medication placebo administer immediately follow baseline scan cognition test . Additional MEG EEG scan conduct 2 , 4 , 6 hour medication placebo administration . On Study Days 3 - 5 , subject undergo identical procedure cross receive alternate medication placebo .</detailed_description>
