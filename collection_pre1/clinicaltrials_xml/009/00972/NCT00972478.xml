	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together rituximab combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient newly diagnose stage II , stage III , stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cell-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vorinostat together rituximab combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find safe dose vorinostat use combination R-CHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone ) ( vorinostat-R-CHOP ) . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate patient newly diagnose diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) treat vorinostat R-CHOP therapy ( vorinostat-R-CHOP ) . ( Phase II ) III . To estimate response rate ( complete partial ) 2-year overall survival rate . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate toxicity vorinostat-R-CHOP patient newly diagnose DLBCL . ( Phase II ) V. To assess whether pre-treatment acetylation status histone , expression major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene , and/or percentage cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ tumor infiltrate lymphocyte correlate progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) VI . To explore whether treatment vorinostat-R-CHOP increase histone acetylation , alters expression MHC class II proteins , alters percentage T-cell subset ( CD8+ , CD4+ , forkhead box P3 [ FOXP3 ] + ) infiltrating macrophage . ( Phase II ) VII . To explore whether histone acetylation status tumor tissue correlate MHC class II expression peripheral blood B cell lymphocyte subset . ( Phase II ) VIII . To explore whether change systemic level immune cytokine vorinostat-R-CHOP correlate lymphoma symptom , response , progression-free overall survival . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study vorinostat follow phase II study . Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 1-9 ( accord dose level ) , rituximab intravenously ( IV ) , cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 3 . Patients also receive prednisone PO daily day 3-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
