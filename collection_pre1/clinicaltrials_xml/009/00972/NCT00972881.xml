	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy , cetuximab , radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give capecitabine irinotecan hydrochloride together cetuximab radiation therapy see well work treat patient undergo surgery locally advance rectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess downstaging effectiveness tolerability neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise capecitabine , irinotecan hydrochloride , cetuximab , radiotherapy patient locally advanced rectal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour weekly week 1-6 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour weekly week 2-5 . Patients also undergo pelvic radiotherapy daily receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 week 2-6 . Patients undergo surgery 8 week completion chemoradiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research United Kindom ( UK ) .</detailed_description>
