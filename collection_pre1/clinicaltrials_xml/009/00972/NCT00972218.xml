	<brief_summary>Adalimumab antibody treatment target neutralizes molecule produce body associate inflammation , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . This molecule important factor cause inflammation see people form inflammatory spinal arthritis call spondylitis well inflammation bowel call Crohn 's disease . Spondylitis Crohn 's disease tend go together study assess degree treatment effective patient disorder time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective present study ass efficacy adalimumab ameliorate sign symptom spondyloarthritis associate CD . Although AS patient IBD recruit phase III trial anti-TNF therapy show respond treatment , establish cohort patient exclusive enteropathic spondyloarthritis . Evaluation cohort address several important issue : - Firstly , answer question whether patient enteropathic spondyloarthritis respond treatment adalimumab . - Secondly , since patient IBD represent cohort high risk develop spondyloarthritis , approach allow study efficacy adalimumab patient pre-radiographic inflammatory back pain determine clinical , laboratory , radiological outcome . In particular , use MRI outcome measure explore . In addition , allow evaluation diagnostic criterion pre-radiographic AS . - Thirdly , efficacy adalimumab treat IBD associate SpA previously determine . It assume response observe idiopathic disease . However , important note bowel disease related spondyloarthritis different genetic association idiopathic disease may different underlie pathophysiology . Several biomarkers show reflect response anti-TNF therapy spondyloarthritis e.g . MMP3 VEGF . However , surrogates disease , bowel permeability , yet examine .</detailed_description>
