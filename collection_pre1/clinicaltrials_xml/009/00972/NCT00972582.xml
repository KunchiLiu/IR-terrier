	<brief_summary>When dietary amino acid supplement consume human normally addition normal daily requirement . The investigator ' laboratory play leading role define estimate average requirement ( EAR ) recommend dietary intake `` essential '' amino acid ( Dietary Reference Intakes 2005 ) . The important less well studied component Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRI ) - What safe upper limit intake ? The investigator propose determine safe upper limit dietary essential amino acid . The recently publish DRI ( 2005 ) define Tolerable Upper Intake Level ( UL ) 'the high average daily nutrient intake level likely pose risk adverse health effect almost individual general population . ' As intake increase UL , potential risk adverse effect may increase ' . In proposal , investigator define novel method define safe upper limit 'maximum oxidative potential ' amino acid identifies 'metabolic limit ' dispose amino acid . Intakes amino acid level increase potential adverse effect appear .</brief_summary>
