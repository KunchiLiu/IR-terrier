	<brief_summary>The investigator wish determine whether short period exercise training ( 5-10 day ) improve metabolic cardiovascular response people risk develop type 2 diabetes eat meal . In healthy people , blood flow skeletal muscle increase eat meal , help regulate blood sugar level deliver blood sugar muscle store metabolize . In people risk type 2 diabetes , blood flow increase much eating meal , may contribute elevate blood sugar concentration observe individual . The investigator wish determine whether exercise improve response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance characterize decreased sensitivity metabolic action insulin ( glucose disposal ) hallmark obesity type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Insulin resistance also prominent component cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , include hypertension , coronary artery disease , atherosclerosis , characterize endothelial dysfunction . Insulin stimulate two distinct signal pathways endothelium . One produce vasodilator nitric oxide ( NO ) insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) /endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) pathway stimulate production endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , vasoconstrictor , mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . Insulin-mediated glucose disposal largely dependent upon vasodilatory effect insulin ; however , T2D , insulin-stimulated dilation impair result imbalance NO ET-1 production , lead diminish microvascular perfusion skeletal muscle glucose delivery response insulin . The effect exercise insulin signaling/action endothelium fully understood . The purpose study determine acute effect aerobic exercise training cardiometabolic response meal ingestion individual insulin resistance T2D . We recruit 30 previously sedentary ( &lt; 60 minute plan exercise/week ) men woman insulin resistance ( pre-diabetes ) T2D participation study . Participants undergo screening procedure , include telephone screen physical examination , well determination body composition fitness . Participants ask complete 5-10 day supervise exercise training undergo test assess cardiovascular metabolic responses oral glucose tolerance test , include muscle sympathetic nerve activity , blood flow , circulate glucose insulin concentration baseline follow training . In addition , participant use continuous glucose monitor system 3 day baseline 3 day exercise train assess effect acute exercise postprandial glucose response mixed meal free-living individual . The overall aim project determine whether acute exercise training influence postprandial metabolic , vascular autonomic nervous system responses individual insulin resistance T2D .</detailed_description>
