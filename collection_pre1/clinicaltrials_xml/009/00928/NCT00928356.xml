	<detailed_description>The study population consist patient multivessel coronary artery disease require CABG suitable anatomy combination CABG PCI non-bypassed artery . The primary endpoint feasibility study 30-day composite major adverse clinical event include death , repeat revascularization , stroke and/or myocardial infarction . The secondary endpoint include : 1 . Successful completion sit CABG coronary stent procedure 2 . Successful completion CABG PCI single hospitalization 3 . Achievement complete revascularization 4 . Patency LIMA stented vessel determine coronary angiography time procedure prior discharge cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography ( CTA ) coronary angiography 1 year . 5 . Stent thrombosis 24 hour ( acute ) , 30 day ( sub acute ) , 1 year ( late ) 6 . One-year composite clinical event endpoint major clinical event include death , repeat revascularization , myocardial infarction , freedom angina 7 .
