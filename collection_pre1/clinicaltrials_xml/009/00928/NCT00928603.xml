	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer considerable health risk men throughout world . In United States , prostate cancer second third lead cause cancer death men last 75 year . In European Union , estimate 68,000 men die prostate cancer 2004 , make third common cause cancer relate death While prostate cancer mortality East Asian country remain low Europe United States , continuously dramatically increase last 40 year . With introduction PSA screen test transrectal ultrasound guide prostate biopsy , detection rate prostate carcinoma markedly improve . Surgery irradiation provide excellent long-term cancer control may accompany risk side effect decrease quality life . Since prostate cancer grow slowly , even untreated , might never progress symptomatic disease , patient clinician face dilemma , treat localized prostate cancer . Due stage migration prostate cancer , potential patient undergo unnecessary treatment risk treatment related morbidity , , last year , increase interest alternative strategy offer possibility delaying , obviate minimize impact treatment maintain oncological long term result . One strategy active surveillance selective delay intervention . Active surveillance consist appropriate selection patient safely avoid radical treatment attendant potential morbidity , regular rigorous monitoring cancer via physical examination , PSA , biopsies image initiation treatment curative intent clinical , pathological radiographic evidence disease progression . Despite pros con recently address , active surveillance gain popularity men low risk prostate cancer ( around 7 % men localize prostate cancer Cancer Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor national registry elect undergo active surveillance initial treatment option ) . Traditionally solid tumor treat radical surgery selective , organ spar therapy common tumor breast , skin kidney , result equivalent rate cancer control , low morbidity rate less disfigurement . With mind potential role focal ablative therapy localize prostate cancer might consider . We investigate feasibility efficacy term quality life oncologic result focal therapy pilot randomize prospective study patient localized prostate cancer meet low risk criterion base clinical , biopsy image data .</detailed_description>
