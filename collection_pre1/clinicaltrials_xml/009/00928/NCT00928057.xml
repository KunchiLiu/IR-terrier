	<brief_summary>Anxiety needle commonly express concern diabetic begin insulin therapy . A shorter , thinner pen needle delivers insulin safety efficacy profile currently market pen needle may appeal many diabetic patient new needle may perceive less intimidate comfortable . Currently market pen needle range length 5 12.7 millimeter ( mm ) . The primary purpose study evaluate whether investigational 4mm x 32 Gauge ( G ) pen needle manufactured Becton , Dickinson Company ( BD ) provide equivalent glucose control ( measure fructosamine level ) currently market BD 5mm x 31 G BD 8mm x 31 G pen needle ( PN ) diabetic subject vary insulin dosage regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within dose group , subject randomly assign baseline one two study arm . One study arm ( 4/5 mm PN ) compare BD 4mm PN 5mm PN , arm ( 4/8 mm PN ) compare BD 4mm PN 8mm PN , crossover fashion . Based randomization , subject use either 4mm assigned PN ( 5mm 8mm ) first 3 week , switch alternate PN next 3 week . Glycemic control assess serum fructosamine ( FRU ) level end 3 week period . Based baseline insulin regimen , subject also assign insulin dose group ( Low Regular ) help ensure balance among treatment arm . Requirements group follow : Low Dose : large single dose insulin day pen device must less equal 20 unit . Regular Dose : large single dose insulin day , pen device , must 21-40 unit . Explanation Visits Timing Assessments : Visit 1 : - Screening - Informed Consent - Demographics - Inclusion /Exclusion - Hemoglobin A1c measurement ( HbA1c ) Visit 2 ( Baseline : ) - Insulin dose group assignment ( Low dose Regular dose ) - Randomization - Fructosamine blood sample collect - Dispense pen needle ( PN ) assign first Visit 3 ( approximately 3 week start first PN ) - Pain rat subject relative baseline PN - Review Adverse Events ( AEs ) report event injection site leakage - Fructosamine blood sample collect - Dispense second assign PN Visit 4 ( approximately 3 week start second PN ) : - Review AEs report event injection site leakage - Fructosamine blood sample collect - Pain rated relative previously use PN - Study Completion</detailed_description>

Body Mass Index 18 50 kg/m² , inclusive . Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 9.5 percent ( % ) , inclusive . Largest single dose insulin day less equal 40 unit Current status history medical condition would contraindicate treatment study product condition , opinion Investigator , would place subject risk potential confound interpretation study result ( i.e . recent history ketoacidosis , hypoglycemic unawareness , etc. ) . Hemophilia disorder cause excessive bleeding require frequent transfusion . History intravenous drug abuse ( selfreported ) . Bleeding disorder , hemophilia subject currently take anticoagulant medication ( e.g. , heparin , Coumadin® , warfarin ) . Selfreported blood borne infection .
