	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether image 18F-choline PET/CT provide information may help guide subsequent investigational clinical treatment patient advanced ( hormone-refractory ) metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Response Monitoring With 18F-choline PET/CT Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet eligibility criterion enrol undergo whole-body image 18F-choline PET/CT 3 time point course treatment indicated castrate resistant prostate cancer . The 1st PET/CT scan perform baseline treatment initiation . The 2nd 3rd scan perform two treatment-releated timepoints approximately 1 month 3 month treatment initiation . Change lesion 18F-choline uptake baseline measure time point determine . Cancer 18F-choline uptake evaluate marker therapeutic response comparison PSA response symptom score . Treatment-related change tumor 18F-choline uptake occur study second third PET scan determine acuity change tumor 18F-choline uptake expect follow specific treatment castrate-resistant prostate cancer . The study evaluate diagnostic intervention treatment consider part investigation . All treatment decision make independent study must deem clinically-warranted treat physician .</detailed_description>
