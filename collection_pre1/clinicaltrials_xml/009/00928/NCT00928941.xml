	<brief_title>Neural Correlates Cognitive Rehabilitation Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objective ( ) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) establish relatively common significant number OEF/OIF Veterans ( Vasterling &amp; Brailey , 2005 ; Hoge et al. , 2008 ) . Attention deficit , prominent PTSD , may due difficulty sustain attention time encode get information storage lead reduced attention memory score neuropsychological measure . Disruptions attention common many type neurological psychiatric disorder . Deficient attentional skill may negatively affect cognitive performance area ( e.g. , memory , plan ) thereby reduce effectiveness navigate daily life task well decrease Veteran 's life satisfaction return home . The origin attention impairment may amenable sophisticated remediation approach use `` bottom , neuroscience base '' visual training program ( i.e. , Posit Science , Inc. cognitive rehabilitation program ) , successful improve neurocognitive function healthy old adult ( e.g. , Mahncke et al. , 2006 ) patient Schizophrenia ( e.g. , Bell al. , 2008 ) . By engage Veterans PTSD target remediation , expect behavioral ( see neuropsychological test gain ) neural activity ( e.g. , BOLD response fMRI ) reflect improvement may link improved outcome daily function . 2 . Research Design : The longitudinal research design project three factor mixed factorial design subject factor PTSD ( +PTSD x -PTSD ) cognitive remediation [ cogrem x video game ] within subject variable time test ( pre-training , post-training , 3 month follow ) . There 40 participant enrol follow group 10 : 1 ) +PTSD/cogrem , 2 ) +PTSD/video game , 3 ) -PTSD/cogrem , 4 ) -PTSD/video game . PTSD status determine diagnosis PTSD identify clinical interview DSM-IV diagnostic criterion PTSD . The active treatment cognitive training . Veterans group receive Posit Science ( Mahncke et al. , 2006 ) visual cognitive remediation paradigm 40 hour train . The control treatment video game design Nintendo DS handheld system , intend improve mental functioning call Brain Age ( Nintendo , Inc. ) play 40 hour . Groups compare difference score neuropsychological , neurobehavioral neuroimaging data see benefit cognitive training benefit great group PTSD . 3 . Methodology : Forty outpatient Veterans enrol . All individual receive neurobehavioral interview , neuropsychological test neuroimaging baseline visit , post training follow-up visit . After baseline visit , volunteer randomize one two condition . 4 . Findings : This new study finding date . 5 . Clinical Relationships : This study examine effect standard cognitive rehabilitation program OEF/OIF veterans cognitive deficit due PTSD . 6 . This project impact veteran ' healthcare identify cognitive problem PTSD test ability rehabilitation program remediate problem .</detailed_description>
