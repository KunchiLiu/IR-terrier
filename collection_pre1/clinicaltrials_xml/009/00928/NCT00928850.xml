	<brief_summary>This study aim determine whether surgeon Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center able randomize patient test modification surgery remove prostate . Surgery remove prostate know `` radical prostatectomy '' . Surgeons know many thing best way radical prostatectomy . However , disagreement aspect surgery . Two modification surgery remove prostate ( radical prostatectomy ) identify study include Irrigation , Fascial Suturing . Two aspect operation may vary , fascial suture urethral irrigation . For aspect , surgeon use clinical judgment best interest patient . In word , clear reason use avoid fascial suturing approach , surgeon act accordingly ; similarly , clear reason irrigate avoid irrigate urethra , surgeon make appropriate clinical decision . If surgeon unsure approach take , randomization scheme follow . All surgeon take part study use technique different time . However , unsure best approach . Sometimes , use different treatment different patient . Irrigation . Cancer cell spill surgery cause cancer return ( `` recur '' ) . Some surgeon believe `` irrigate '' could help stop spill cancer cell . `` Irrigating '' mean wash surgical area sterile water suck water back tube . As result , surgeon vary irrigate . In study , examine irrigation urethra . This part body carry urine bladder penis . Fascial suturing . Surgeons believe happen urethra affect risk incontinence . This patient control urine , drip leak urine . One idea additional stitch ( `` suture '' ) connective tissue ( `` fascia '' ) could helpful , know sure .</brief_summary>
