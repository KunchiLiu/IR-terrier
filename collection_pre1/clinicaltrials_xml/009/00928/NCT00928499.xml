	<brief_summary>Sacral Nerve Stimulation ( SNS ) deliver non-painful , mild electrical pulse sacral nerve modulate reflex influence bladder , sphincter , pelvic floor improve restore normal void function . Sacral nerve stimulation indicate refractory void dysfunction include urinary urgency/frequency , urinary urge incontinence , nonobstructive urinary retention . Since introduction , SNS undergone significant improvement design application implantation minimally invasive procedure local intravenous ( IV ) sedation . However , despite progress make advance therapy minimally invasive procedure , neither data guideline ideal program setting . The purpose study evaluate program parameter cyclic versus continuous stimulation efficacy therapy . If therapy equally efficacious setting , cyclic set advantage result long battery life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Continuous Versus Cyclic Stimulation Interstim Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The component SNS include quadripolar lead wire place adjacent sacral nerve root ( typically S3 ) , implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) lead wire attach . The IPG provide electrical impulse several parameter amenable adjustment include rate , strength length stimulation . Additionally , stimulation program continuous cyclic . If therapy equally efficacious setting , cyclic set advantage result long battery life . This would prolong time interval IPG replacement would reduce number time patient expose surgical procedure may substantial impact reduce cost healthcare system . Participants randomize one two group : either cyclic stimulation continuous stimulation IPG placement continue set four week . Subjects return office 4 week post-op . They complete 3-day consecutive voiding diary prior study visit . The subject undergo reprogramming change stimulation alternate pattern ( cyclic continuous vice versa appropriate ) keep parameter . Subjects ask return office 4 week switch alternate setting . She complete 3-day consecutive voiding diary prior visit . The subject also ask preference mode stimulation reason choice . After visit , participant switch mode stimulation efficacious .</detailed_description>
