	<detailed_description>Objective : A routine ECG perform part standard diagnostic workup non-cardiac surgery . However , add value test beyond patient history physical examination questionable . The propose study therefore aim determine whether preoperative assessment without ECG cost-effective . Study design : Prospective step wedge design multicenter trial include 40,000 patient . Study population : All patient age 60 year , young patient cardiovascular risk factor , schedule non-cardiac surgery expect postoperative hospital stay least 2 day . Intervention : A new preoperative assessment strategy without routine ECG . Initially , patient participate center assess follow regular strategy ( routine ECG ) . The new strategy ( without routine ECG ) roll participate hospital sequentially . At end trial participate center use new preoperative strategy . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure cardiac death perioperative myocardial infarction . The latter verified Troponin value postoperative day 1 2 . If Troponin level elevate presence myocardial infarction evaluate consult cardiologist . Secondary outcome major cardiovascular complication , death cause within 2 day surgery , long term quality life . To determine cost-effectiveness strategy without ECG pre- postoperative referral intervention take account . Sample size calculation : We expect increase primary outcome intervention group . To rule 0.5 % increase ( 3 % 3.5 % ) intervention group , inclusion 36,504 patient require ( level confidence : 0.95 ; power : 0.80 ) . To compensate expect 10 % loss-to-follow , 40,000 patient randomize . Economic evaluation : A cost-effectiveness analysis conduct increase primary outcome 0.0 0.5 % . If intervention result low prevalence primary outcome , cost-effectiveness analysis perform health cost outcome point , advantageous , direction . An increase 0.5 % consider acceptable clinical point view .</detailed_description>
