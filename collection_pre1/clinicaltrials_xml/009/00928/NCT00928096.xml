	<brief_summary>In study , radiation therapy plan make 20 consecutive patient mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma . One plan do use breathe adapt pre-chemo PET-CT scan fuse post-chemo planning CT scan another plan do use standard procedure pre-chemo PET-CT fuse post-chemo planning CT scan . Dose level lymphoma organ risk compare patient . The best radiation therapy plan use treat patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy use breathe adapted therapy scan routine technique breast cancer . Breathing adapt radiotherapy may also reduce radiation dose organ risk , e.g . heart lung , patient mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Optimal radiation therapy lymphoma patient include radiotherapy plan use pre-chemotherapy PET-scanning , fuse post-chemo planning CT-scan . This make accurate treatment pre-chemo involved volume possible also accurate radiation post-chemo involve volume possible . Thus , optimal breathing adapt radiation require plan use breathe adapt pre-chemo PET-CT scan fuse breathe adapt post-chemo planning CT scan . In study , 20 consecutive patient mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas combination therapy chemotherapy radiation therapy involve node . Two radiation therapy plan make patient : one use breathe adapt pre-chemo PET-CT scan fuse post-chemo planning CT scan , one use standard procedure pre-chemo PET-CT scan fuse post-chemo planning CT scan . Dose level lymphoma organ risk compare patient . The best radiation therapy plan use treat patient .</detailed_description>
