	<detailed_description>Low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOs ) serious complication critically ill patient undergo major surgery , result multiple organ damage significant in-hospital long-term morbidity mortality , well prolonged hospital stay . In set mortality rate distressingly high despite improvement intensive care treatment , survivor acceptable quality life . No inotropic drug ever demonstrate beneficial effect outcome set heart failure perioperative period major surgery . Previous study meta-analysis suggest increased mortality patient receive `` old '' inotropic drug . The originality large multicentre randomize placebo-controlled trial stand current non-evidenced-based-medicine use inotropic agent critically ill patient low cardiac output syndrome decompensated heart failure . Interestingly , calcium sensitizer levosimendan double mechanism action could explain , part , expect document , first time , beneficial effect inotropic agent clinically relevant outcome : binding cardiac troponin C , enhance myofilament responsiveness calcium , thereby increase myocardial contraction without increase myocardial oxygen consumption ; addition , levosimendan activates adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channel important mediator ischemic pharmacological cardioprotection . Most importantly , originality trial stay update knowledge principal investigator . After publish first meta-analysis topic document cardioprotective property drug , perform meta-analyses , document , first time , possible beneficial effect survival inotropic agent . Even present preliminary result meta-analysis important congress , still `` competitive advantage '' regard investigator fully aware important result meta-analyses . In first meta-analysis total 139 patient undergoing cardiac surgery ( 5 randomize clinical trial ) randomize receive levosimendan best available treatment . We observe levosimendan associate significant reduction cTn peak release ( weighted mean difference = 2.5 ng/dl [ -3.86 , -1.14 ] , p = 0.0003 . ) time hospital discharge ( weighted mean difference = -1.38 day [ -2.78,0.03 ] , p = 0.05 ) . The second , updated meta-analysis ( total 440 patient 10 randomize controlled study ) also perform specific set cardiac surgery . Levosimendan associate significant reduction postoperative mortality ( 11/235 [ 4.7 % ] levosimendan group vs 26/205 [ 12.7 % ] control arm , OR=0.38 [ 0.19-0.76 ] , p effect=0.007 , NNT=12 ) . In third meta-analysis , include 3350 cardiac surgery heart failure patient receive levosimendan ( 1893 patient ) best available treatment ( 1457 patient ) use levosimendan associate significant reduction mortality ( 333/1893 [ 17.6 % ] levosimendan group vs 326/1457 [ 22.4 % ] control arm , OR=0.74 [ 0.62-0.89 ] , p effect=0.001 NNT=21 ) . It underline inotropic drug ever demonstrate beneficial effect outcome set heart failure cardiac surgery . On contrary , previous study meta-analysis suggest increased mortality patient receive `` old '' inotropic drug . Study hypothesis levosimendan reduce mortality high risk patient undergoing cardiac surgery It underline 're plan treat patient `` early '' course low cardiac output syndrome : beginning surgery case ejection fraction &lt; 25 % , immediately cardiopulmonary bypass patient need high dos inotropic drug wean , early intensive care patient develop initial low cardiac output syndrome within 24 hour surgery ) . In summary , originality study include : - study clinical set high mortality rate previously study inotropic agent fail - use updated evidence base medicine ( meta-analyses ) background study hypothesis - involve patient would benefit cardiac protection ( early low cardiac output syndrome ) - use new inotropic agent increase myocardial oxygen consumption pharmacological preconditioning effect According recent meta-analysis , ( 1 ) use levosimendan reduces mortality cardiac surgery . Common experience meta-analyses also suggest beneficial cardioprotective effect agent could also translate reduce intensive care hospital stay . This likely result decrease use hospital resource , therefore , cost care . This effect important selectively enroll high risk patient risk death high . Reduction cost per patient also relevant . The aim randomise , double blind study confirm promise result cite meta-analyses provide valid clinical evidence property levosimendan critically ill patient undergo cardiac surgery . 30.000 cardiac surgical intervention perform Italy every year ( 1.000.000 world ) . Since mortality 2 % general population 20 % high risk subgroup , estimate 150 high risk patient per year 100 low risk patient ( overall 7.500 world ) could benefit ( survive ) yearly thanks result study . Reduction cost per patient striking , since low cardiac output syndrome prolongs intensive care hospital stay . Study procedures We 're plan large randomize double-blind clinical trial ( levosimendan v placebo ) enroll patient undergoing cardiac surgery ( coronary artery bypass grafting , valvular repair replacement , ascend aorta replacement… ) . The study drug administer Intensive Care Unit 24-48 hour patient observe till ICU discharge . Telephone follow perform 30 day one year . Randomization Subjects allocate accord centralize randomization derive computer-generated list random number ( sealed opaque envelope ) available shortly preparation study drug . Data collect trained observer participate patient care blind administer drug . The randomisation , perform last available moment , reduce bias together double blindness study . The study conduct cardiac surgery operating room intensive care unit Italian Teaching Hospital . This hospitals structure equipment conduct research . It underline study simple design administration levosimendan versus placebo non-routinely part management enrol patient . All patient include study strictly assist qualified personnel evaluate possible clinical variation . All routinely invasively monitor . According literature , Levosimendan administer start dose 0.05 ug/kg/min ( range 0.05 0.2 ug/kg/min ) 24-48 hour ( till discharge intensive care unit ) . Levosimendan dilute follow : 1 ampul 5 ml ( 2.5 mg/ml ) 100 ml glucose 5 % . Levosimendan compare double blind randomised fashion placebo prepared follow : `` Soluvit '' ATC BO5XC ( mixture vitamins yellow colour indistinguishable study drug Levosimendan ) half ampul 100 ml glucose 5 % Both Levosimendan placebo ( soluvit ) keep fridge . The study drug start operating room ICU . The drug safe administer thousand patient last year . The patient include protocol high risk patient undergoing cardiac surgery . We plan notify Ministry adverse reaction directly relate drug Hospital authority observe death . The complication ( adverse event ) commonly occur cardiac surgery consider `` disease progression '' report authority study , promptly available list result final manuscript . The patient include study receive standard intensive treatment ( general anesthesia , pacing , inotropic drug , mechanical ventilation , postoperative sedation , diuretic , intravenous fluid , antibiotics… . ) monitoring ( invasive arterial pressure , electrocardiogram , central venous pressure , pulseoximetry , temperature , arterial blood gas ) frequent routinely laboratory examination . All patient receive standard premedication , one large-bore iv catheter radial artery cannulate induction anaesthesia ; pulse oximetry , 5 lead ECG automate ST-segment analysis , central venous pressure , capnometry urine output monitor well . Temperature monitor bladder rectal probe . Transesophageal echocardiography use CPB wean clinical purpose , data record . Induction anaesthesia perform ipnotic analgesic orotracheal intubation facilitate muscle relaxant . Anaesthesia maintain intravenous volatile agent . No aprotinin use . CPB conduct institutional custom pack . Myocardial protection ensure cardioplegia solution . After surgery , patient transfer intensive care unit ( ICU ) wean ventilator soon hemodynamically stable major bleeding , normothermic , adequate level consciousness pain control achieve . Weaning catecholamine infusion guide standard hemodynamic criterion . Postoperative pain relief provide patient . Decision transfer patient ICU ward base criterion : SpO2 &gt; 94 % FiO2 &lt; 0.5 facemask , adequate cardiac stability hemodynamically significant arrhythmia , chest tube drainage &lt; 50 ml/h , urine output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/h , intravenous inotropic vasopressor agent excess dopamine 5 ug/kg/min , seizure activity . Criteria hospital discharge hemodynamic cardiac rhythm stability , presence clean dry incision , afebrile , normal bowel movement , independent ambulation feeding .</detailed_description>
