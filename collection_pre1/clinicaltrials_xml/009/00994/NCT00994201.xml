	<brief_summary>The purpose study see new technique measure HNSCC tumor magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) help predict well tumor respond combine chemotherapy radiation treatment . The investigator hope find reliable method determine whether patient 's cancer respond chemo-radiation early treatment use MRI , cancer treatment could tailor individual effective future . The MRI technique include dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) , diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Participants subject two session MRI scan : one initiation regular treatment second second cycle chemotherapy . Each scan session last approximately 45 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DCE-MRI , DW-MRI , MRS potential measure early cellular change occur response successful therapy , chemoradiation , demonstrate early predictor therapeutic response , also overall survival malignancy . Our long-term goal use image technique develop non-invasive functional imaging methodology would better predictor pathological response current clinical standard .</detailed_description>
