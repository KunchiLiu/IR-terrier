	<brief_summary>Statins ( HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ) widely use class cholesterol-lowering drug establish role medical management cardiovascular disease . Their benefit also show surgical setting decrease cardiovascular complication lower perioperative mortality follow cardiac vascular surgery . There considerable evidence show statin useful pleiotropic property extend beyond cholesterol lowering , include anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant , immunomodulatory fibrinolytic effect . Growing evidence suggest effect may useful attenuate proinflammatory metabolic stress response surgery benefit statin may extend surgical setting abdominal surgery . Laboratory study demonstrate surgically-relevant benefit statins show decrease peritoneal inflammation , reduce severity intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury , improve survival model abdominal sepsis , decrease formation postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion improve heal colonic anastomosis . Retrospective clinical study show statins improve outcome sepsis , reduce postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) associate decreased rate surgical wound infection postoperative respiratory complication follow various non-cardiac general surgical procedure . However , prospective study specifically evaluate perioperative use statins abdominal surgery . Using colorectal surgery model major abdominal surgery , investigator conduct randomise controlled trial evaluate effect perioperative statin use postoperative morbidity , local systemic inflammatory response , functional recovery surgery .</brief_summary>
