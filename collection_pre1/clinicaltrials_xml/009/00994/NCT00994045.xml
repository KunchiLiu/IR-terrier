	<brief_summary>Thoracoabdominal aneurysm ( TAAA ) repair major elective vascular operation associate large blood loss potentially life-threatening clotting abnormality . Theses clot abnormality principally treat use fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) ( derive human blood donation ) , administration carry number risk include virus transmission ( human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B , hepatitis C ) infection variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease ( vCJD ) . FFP longer administer child high-usage adult UK infection risk , recently decide UK advisory body use UK-derived FFP cease . Fibrinogen concentrate alternative treatment option FFP think less infection risk ( purify , heat treat ) license use many year European country . The investigator use fibrinogen concentrate recently department alternative FFP encouraging result . 20 patient undergoing elective TAAA repair The Royal Infirmary Edinburgh randomly allocate receive standard treatment ( FFP ) fibrinogen concentrate treatment clot abnormality surgery . The investigator take number additional blood sample provide valuable information pattern clot abnormality type operation . The investigator also record blood loss number allogeneic ( derive human donor ) blood component transfuse patient ( red cell , FFP platelet ) . Our primary objective ass pattern coagulation abnormality group . We also examine whether use fibrinogen concentrate TAAA repair avoids need administer FFP .</brief_summary>
