	<brief_summary>Flavor primary dimension young child determine food acceptance . However , child merely miniature adult since sensory system mature postnatally response certain taste differ markedly adult . Moreover , emerge research reveal sensitive period infancy early flavor experience serve modify late response flavor food . The propose study aim investigate important issue use model system class infant formula hydrolyze protein base thus pronounced distinctive flavor unpalatable older-aged infant adult . This research initiate anecdotal report pediatrician although easy introduce type formula infant first month life , become extremely difficult later infancy . Indeed , recent study investigator ' laboratory provide first experimental demonstration infant young 4 month age willingly accept substantial amount , satiate feeding , novel , protein hydrolysate formula . In marked contrast , infant older 4 month reject protein hydrolysate formula rejection occurs within first minute feed , find strongly suggest sensory quality formula responsible , least part , rejection . Moreover , rejection evident investigator test older-aged infant unfamiliar , non-hydrolysate , formula . In word , rejection appear response particular component component protein hydrolysate formula . This shift acceptability ameliorate prior exposure . That , formulas introduce infant within first month life feed continuously , remain highly acceptable throughout infancy early childhood . These observation implicate sensitive period development , occur somewhere 4 month age , exposure formula , unpalatable adult infant 4 month age without exposure , render acceptable presumably palatable . To investigator ' knowledge , clearest example sensitive period development response food flavor human thus far identify . There paucity information whether composition formula feed infant influence short-term feeding behavior first month life . The primary objective longitudinal study determine period early infancy exposure casein-hydrolysate formula , Nutramigen , render acceptable later infancy . The study also aim determine early sensory experience formula impact upon food acceptance infancy ( 8-9 month age ) childhood . The investigator also explore variation gene encode taste receptor influence preference foods behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This basic research , longitudinal experimental study infant randomize one six group ( N=10-15 per group ) differ time type formula infant feed month 7-month exposure period . Each mother-infant dyad study 2-3rd week life approximately 9 month age . When infant less three week age mother 's decision formula feed well establish , infant randomize one six group differ time type formula infant feed month 7-month exposure period . One group ( Control EEEEEEE ) assign milk-based formula , Enfamil ( E ) , whereas another group ( NNNNNNN ) assign Nutramigen ( N ) entire 7-month period study . The 4 group assign feed Nutramigen specify period first seven month life ( Groups ENEEEEE , EEENEEE , ENNNEEE ) . A variety methodology develop laboratory employed capture infant ' response particular flavor taste exposure period . That , end exposure period , infant videotape 1 ) feeding formula ; 2 ) feeding food ( e.g. , cereal ; soup ) differ flavor ; 3 ) explore scent toy . Each month , infant weigh measure length well evaluated cognitive motor development mother complete standardized questionnaire regard infant temperament . A cheek swab mother infant obtain genotyped taste receptor taste- obesity- relate gene .</detailed_description>
