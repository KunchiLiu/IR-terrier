	<brief_summary>Spine fusion involve procedure patient risk significant intra-operative blood loss.This study compare 2 way determine fluid status response fluid administration . One way measure change arterial wave form special IV usually place artery ( PPV ) . The second way use non-invasive method finger probe measure change plethysmogram pleth variability index ( PVI ) . No actual patient treatment base value surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Pleth Variability Index ( PVI ) Surrogate Pulse Pressure Variations ( PPV ) Pediatric Spine Fusion ( SF ) Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spine fusion involve procedure patient risk significant intra-operative blood loss . The result hypovolemia increase fluctuations arterial pressure associate positive pressure ventilation . These respiratory induce arterial pressure variation ( RIAPV ) appear cyclical peak troughs arterial waveform . Different approach use quantify RIAPV . One approach measure pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) , use invasive arterial monitoring . In previous study , PPV show good indicator fluid responsiveness intra-operatively , specifically evaluate patient undergo spine fusion . This patient population particular interest underlie scoliosis well prone position operation . These two variable could potentially alter lung-thorax mechanic manner may influence RIAPV , specifically determine interaction intrathoracic pressure venous fill heart . A second approach quantify RIAPV relies non invasive technology initially develop Masimo Corporation pulse oximetry . This parameter coin pleth variability index ( PVI ) , specifically quantifies real time change plethysmogram associate respiration . PVI , base arterial blood volume change , therefore analogous PPV , derive change arterial pressure . To date PVI evaluate adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery data suggest may useful indicator fluid responsiveness . Given non-invasive continuous nature PVI , appeal potential use bedside monitor guide fluid resuscitation . However , photoplethysmography know sensitive noise due motion , light electrical interference . Furthermore , PVI base upon degree quantitative evaluation photoplethysmogram first kind . For reason , important understand limit agreement PVI PPV accept PVI non-invasive surrogate measurement . This study intend evaluate PVI analyze relation PPV . More specifically , pair measurement PPV PVI compare determine limit agreement two parameter patient undergo spinal fusion .</detailed_description>
