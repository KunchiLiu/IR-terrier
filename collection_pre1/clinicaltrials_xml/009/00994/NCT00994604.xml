	<brief_title>The Effects Broccoli Sprout Extract Obstructive Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma afflict 23 million people , result nearly 13 million ambulatory physician encounter , 440,000 hospitalization annually . The economic burden 2010 estimate run $ 20.7 billion . Although steroids mainstay treatment , `` cure '' disease . While inflammation may incite factor , mechanism must play crucial role process . Elevated oxidative stress could cause kind chronic inflammation associate asthma , could provide explanation recurrent asthma attack . Cigarette smoke , primary secondary exposure , worsen oxidative stress balance airway . Thus , continue focus simply treat inflammation barrier progress . It critical examine factor , abnormal oxidative stress specific pathway may affect airway inflammation asthma attack . One compound , repair oxidative stress pathway , sulforaphane , food compound find vegetable , include broccoli sprout . Preliminary data demonstrate broccoli sprout extract ( BSE ) , rich sulforaphane , improve airflow measure asthmatic . We plan examine whether airflow abnormality asthma , exacerbation cigarette smoke , prevent administration BSE , determine primary inflammatory oxidative stress signal pathway involve protection provide BSE .</detailed_description>
