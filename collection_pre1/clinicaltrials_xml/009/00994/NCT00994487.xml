	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare female , preschool-aged child breastfed infancy female , preschool-aged child bottle-fed infancy ability adjust calorie intake response internal signal hunger fullness . Children parent come two session , child give drink either high low energy , consume lunch follow drink . The parent present lunch . Greater ability self-regulate intake demonstrate less energy consume lunch follow high energy drink compare lunch follow low energy drink . Lunches videotape parental feeding style ( i.e. , parent interact child lunch ) examine . The primary hypothesis : 1 . ) exclusively breastfed child higher self-regulation ability exclusively bottle-fed child , 2 . ) mother exclusively breastfed child demonstrate parental feeding style characterize less control restriction mother ( parent primarily responsible child feed ) exclusively bottle-fed child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breastfeeding Infancy Food Intake Preschool-Aged Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research report child breastfed infant decrease risk become obese . However , clear breastfeeding may prevent development obesity . Breastfeeding may support maintenance sensitivity internal hunger/fullness cue , help self-regulating energy intake . Additionally , breastfeed may facilitate development parental feeding style low control restriction . This type feeding style also associate great ability self-regulate energy intake . Bottle-feeding shift feed control parent , may lead parental feeding style high control restriction , impair child 's self-regulation ability . The aim study determine female age 3-5 year : 1 . ) breastfed child great energy self- regulation capability ; 2 . ) parent breastfed child demonstrate parental feeding style characterize less control restriction ; 3 . ) child great energy self-regulation capability breastfed parent feed style low control restriction . It hypothesize female , preschool-aged child breastfed and/or parent feed style low control restriction self-regulate intake well female breastfed and/or parent feeding style high control restriction . A within-subjects , counterbalance design , use standard preloading paradigm , measure child 's ability self-regulate intake preloads differ energy density . Children parent participate two trial , child consume preloads high low energy follow lunch energy intake measure . Lunch videotape parental feeding style child 's lunch cod restriction control . Results provide information potential mechanism breastfeed reduces risk obesity obesity relate disease child .</detailed_description>
