	<brief_summary>Background : - An experimental drug call ABT-888 studied combination temozolomide ( type chemotherapy ) adult certain kind cancer . ABT-88 show increase tumor sensitivity temozolomide improve treatment outcomes people cancer . More research need determine combination drug work well effective treatment child brain tumor . This first time combination study pediatric patient . Objectives : - To determine maximum dos ABT-888 temozolomide give combination child brain tumor . - To learn child metabolize clear ABT-888 body appropriate dos medication recommend future clinical trial drug . - To learn side effect may occur ABT-888 temozolomide give together . - To learn certain tumor respond combination drug study characteristic tumor laboratory . Eligibility : - Individuals le 21 year age diagnose cancer nervous system ( include brain brain stem tumor ) respond standard therapy . Design : - Before begin study , participant full medical history physical examination , may also require scan brain spine provide sample cerebrospinal fluid . - Treatment consist 13 28-day cycle therapy , total 52 week ( 1 year ) . Participants receive dose ABT-888 twice daily 5 day , receive dose temozolomide daily 5 day , every 28 day . The morning dose ABT-888 give 60-90 minute dose temozolomide . - Participants routine blood test least week throughout treatment cycle , scan brain spine perform required researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study ABT-888 , Oral Inhibitor Poly ( ADP-ribose ) Polymerase Temozolomide Children With Recurrent/Refractory CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - A subset patient pediatric CNS tumor continue poor prognosis despite advance surgery radiation . Novel strategy require improve outcome patient . - Temozolomide , oral alkylating agent , show modest activity recurrent pediatric CNS tumor , include high-grade glioma , medulloblastoma/PNET , low-grade glioma . - Temozolomide induces single-stranded DNA break , majority repair base excision repair ( BER ) pathway . Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase , PARP , critical nuclear enzyme bind DNA break , recruit activates key protein BER DNA repair pathway , halt DNA replication , facilitate repair damage DNA . - ABT-888 potent orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor show enhance cytotoxicity temozolomide chemotherapy agent several pre-clinical model human tumor . Objectives - To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 combination temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . - To study plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ABT-888 PARP inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) order recommend Phase 2 dose ABT-888 combination temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . - To describe toxicity combination ABT-888 temozolomide child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . Eligibility - Patient must less equal 21 year age registration . - Patients diagnosis primary CNS malignancy ( include low-grade glioma ) recurrent refractory standard therapy know curative therapy Progression recurrence document review MRI scan . If time permit diagnosis confirm NCI Laboratory Pathology . Patients intrinsic brain stem tumor must radiographic evidence progression . - Karnofsky Performance Scale ( KPS great 16 yrs age ) Lansky Performance Score ( LPS le equal 16 year age ) great equal 50 assess within two week study enrollment . - Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy . - Patients receive dexamethasone must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior registration . Design -ABT-888 give twice daily day 1-5 , temozolomide give daily day 1-5 , every 28 day . The morning dose ABT-888 give 60-90 minute prior temozolomide .</detailed_description>
