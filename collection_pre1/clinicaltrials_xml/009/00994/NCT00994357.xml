	<brief_title>The Effect Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring Severe Complications Pregnancy Women With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy outcome woman type 1 type 2 diabetes still significantly poor background population . The prevalence large fat baby ( LGA ) 50 % type diabetes , perinatal death preterm delivery 4-7 time higher non-diabetic woman . These complication closely related non-optimal glycemic control pregnancy , improve metabolic control crucial strive improved pregnancy outcome patient . In 2007 , new generation `` real-time '' Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) become available Denmark . These sensor estimate tissue glucose value automatically frequently immediate display glucose level . In addition possible set alarm high low glucose level , patient react immediately change diet insulin dose . In trial , 154 patient randomize either continuous glucose monitoring five time pregnancy addition standard care ot unchanged standard care . The main aim evaluate use CGM pregnancy reduce prevalence LGA 50 30 % , outcome measurement preterm delivery , neonatal disease , hypoglycemia , low grade inflammation vascular dysfunction , quality life self- care also record .</detailed_description>
