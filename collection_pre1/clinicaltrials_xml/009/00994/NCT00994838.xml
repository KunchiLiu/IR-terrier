	<brief_title>Reduced Calorie Diet Intervention Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation prefer renal replacement therapy end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) affords survival quality life advantage maintenance dialysis.1 The number transplant perform increase year , currently 150,000 individual live United States kidney transplant . This set 68,000 patient wait list median wait time 4 year available organ.2 Despite survival benefit dialysis , transplant patient still greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) general population , CVD lead cause death among recipient function graft.3 Given long wait time kidney due organ shortage , extensive resource use , support need transplant procedure , imperative improve long term patient graft survival . Accordingly , modification CVD risk profile paramount importance kidney transplant patient . The etiology increase risk CVD kidney transplant patient multi-factorial include high burden CVD risk factor present prior transplant , well increase prevalence risk factor post transplant period due transplant associate weight gain , immunosuppression side effect , metabolic consequence function kidney , allograft dysfunction . Efforts reduce CVD risk factor yet adequately implement rigorously study kidney transplant population . Obesity time transplant common associate several CVD risk factor post transplant , include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , metabolic syndrome , inflammation . Obesity also associate potentially poor graft outcome , include death censor graft loss chronic allograft failure.4 In addition , majority patient gain weight post transplantation , primarily form fat mass . Post transplant weight gain also associate increased prevalence know CVD risk factor , CVD death , graft loss.5 The increase burden CVD kidney transplant patient make obesity prevention treatment strategy appeal intervention improve long-term outcome , term graft overall survival . In study measure effect low calorie diet intervention new kidney transplant recipient outcomes weight gain , oxidative stress , insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
