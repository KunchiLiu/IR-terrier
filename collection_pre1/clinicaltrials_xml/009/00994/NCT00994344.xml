	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine non-inferiority efficacy DRV/r ( 900/100 mg ) monotherapy 48 week versus LPV/r ( 400/100 mg ) simplification strategy subject sustain viral suppression stable PI NNRTI-antiretroviral regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pillar current standard care highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) use two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) .1 However , agent inhibit mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma , cause mitochondrial dysfunction , , turn , may cause NRTI-related adverse event peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , liver disturbance , lipid profile abnormality lipoatrophy.2 As result , strategy aim avoid long term exposure NRTIs toxicities desirable management HIV-infected patient . Monotherapy protease inhibitor ( PIs ) simplification approach therapy induction period conventional antiretroviral treatment , appear great utility minimize mitochondrial toxicity NRTIs . This approach may also increase patient adherence , reduce cost preserve future treatment option . However , concern remain regard compartmental HIV replication due limited drug penetration central nervous system , risk factor associate monotherapy failure well extrapolation result obtain clinical trial setting routine clinical practice , still well know . In regard , report suggest lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) monotherapy may effective therapeutic option treatment HIV-1 infection antiretroviral-naïve patient . 5,6 Moreover , study report despite LPV/r allow CSF concentration low plasma , concentration exceed level suppress wild-type HIV replication.7,8,9 However author report LPV/r monotherapy result suboptimal HIV suppression CSF compartment approximately 10 % cases.10 Darunavir last PI activity wild-type PI-resistant HIV . In ARTEMIS trial , DRV/r dose 800/100 mg daily demonstrate non inferior statistically superior LPV/r effective treatment option antiretroviral ( ARV ) -naïve patient . In study , patient receive once-daily DRV/r achieve high durable virologic response rate , comparable patient less favourable baseline characteristic suboptimal adherence . In addition , low discontinuation rate due virologic failure adverse event , develop protease inhibitor resistance upon failure , suitable drug exposure . 11,12 All benefit , couple higher genetic barrier , favourable safety plasmatic pharmacokinetic profile DRV/r , suggest DRV/r potential excellent option monotherapy simplification strategy . The investigator propose prospective randomise clinical trial compare efficacy , safety tolerability DRV/r 900/100 mg monotherapy daily versus LPV/r 400/100 monotherapy twice daily simplification strategy HIV-infected patient stable NNRTI PI-based antiretroviral regimen sustain viral suppression . Aside main goal project , investigator go make use sample obtain CSF 48 week follow-up ( representative virus replicate central nervous system ) genital tract plasma different time point . The investigator compare sequence population organ different patient order state virus find plasma one time point find reservoir find blood infection advance .</detailed_description>
