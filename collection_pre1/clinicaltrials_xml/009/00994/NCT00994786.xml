Pregabalin ( Lyrica ) anticonvulsant medication appear novel mechanism action . It show enhance activity gamma-amino-butyric acid ( GABA ) receptor well inhibit glutamate release . These two neurotransmitter system implicate neurobiology OCD . The study consist patient attain full response SRI . The patient randomize double-blind fashion augmentation pregabalin ( Lyrica ) placebo .
