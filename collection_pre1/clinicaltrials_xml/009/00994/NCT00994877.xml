	<brief_summary>Methods : The study observational prospective trial include 150 patient 18 old admit icu severe sepsis septic shock define American College Chest Physicians/ Society Critical Care Medicine consensus conference . Patients whose primary reason hospital admission sepsis patient develop sepsis elective invasive procedure include . Only patient know former primary coagulation/hypercoagulability disorder wil exclude . Procedure : Within 12 hour admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) blood drawn follow : Blood count , glucose , urea , creatinine , liver function test , prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , Ddimer , fibrinogen TEG ( thromboelastography ) assay perform . These blood test also draw day 2 4 admission . On day one , another 3 cc blood drawn frozen -80 degree level coagulation factor : I , II , V , VII , VIII , IX , X , XI , XII , XIII , Antithrombin III , protein C , S. Demographic data collect accord patient chart , acute physiologic chronic health evaluation ( APACHE ) II score assess 24 hour . Vital sign collect monitor . Informed consent wave due lack intervention general condition patient unable sign inform consent . Control group include 10 healthy individual . End point : The primary end point determine common hypercoagulable/coagulation disorder accord TEG . The secondary end point determine whether TEG result prognostic implication group severe septic patient .</brief_summary>
