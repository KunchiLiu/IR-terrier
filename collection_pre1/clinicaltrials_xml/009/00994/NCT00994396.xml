	<brief_title>Vitamin D Improve Glucose Metabolism Reduce Inflammation Obese Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The alarm rise pediatric obesity past decade associated increase occurrence impair glucose tolerance inflammation child adolescent . These condition part `` metabolic syndrome '' , child risk factor much likely develop cardiovascular disease diabetes adult compare lean peer . Within last year grow body evidence optimize vitamin D ( vit D ) status may alleviate obesity-associated complication . Further , also research show well vit D status overweight individual , favorably respond diet lose body fat . The prevalence vit D deficiency/insufficiency North American population classify `` epidemic '' expert field obese teen consider even great risk deficiency tend store vit D fat store readily mobilize use body . The investigator ' project study effect optimize vit D status obese adolescent marker glucose metabolism inflammation . Obese teen attend establish adolescent weight loss clinic supplement high-dose vit D 6 month ( mo ) administer concurrently standard medical care treatment . At baseline , 3 mo 6 mo investigator measure vit D status , serum marker insulin sensitivity glucose metabolism ; serum marker inflammation ; body weight/height waist circumference . At baseline 6 mo investigator also measure body composition ( percent body fat dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ) confound lifestyle factor know affect vit D , glucose metabolism inflammation ( e.g. , nutrient intake , physical activity , sun exposure , pubertal stage ) . Results glean study help advance prevention treatment obesity-related complication potential lead significant reduction healthcare cost co-morbidities .</detailed_description>
