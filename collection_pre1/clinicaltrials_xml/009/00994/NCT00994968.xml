	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , S-1 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study give doxorubicin hydrochloride together cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , S-1 surgery treat woman stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , Cyclophosphamide , Docetaxel , S-1 Before Surgery Treating Women With Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine rate pathologic complete response woman previously untreated stage II III breast cancer treat neoadjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel S1 . Secondary - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine rate overall radiologic response patient . - Determine rate breast-conserving procedure patient . - Determine disease-free survival patient . - Investigate relevant pharmacogenomics biomarker ( ) useful predict response anticancer treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive neoadjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral S-1 day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course . Two four week later , patient undergo surgery remove tumor ( either breast-conserving procedure mastectomy ) . Patients may undergo radiotherapy receive endocrine therapy .</detailed_description>
