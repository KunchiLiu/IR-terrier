	<brief_title>Monotherapy Versus Dual Therapy Initial Treatment Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine patient randomise aggressive ( combination therapy ) treatment initial treatment hypertension well blood pressure control compare randomise less aggressive ( monotherapy ) treatment despite subsequent add-on treatment similar group . This test hypothesis monotherapy patient 'never catch ' combination therapy patient . 1 . To determine 'never catch-up ' phenomenon improve BP control persist least one year . 2 . To understand underlie mechanism improve BP control ; specifically : 1 . To determine due haemodynamic compensation , increase sodium retention volume expansion . 2 . To determine due increase peripheral resistance . 3 . To understand predictor BP control i.e . age , baseline renin status , sodium status plasma volume . 4 . To validate National Institute Clinical Excellence / British Hypertension Society joint guideline ACD algorithm compare BP control monotherapy crossover arm phase 1 correlate age ( ≤ 55 &gt; 55y ) , baseline characteristic renin . 5 . To determine safety tolerability strategy prescribe combination therapy initial step versus monotherapy initial step .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet ALL inclusion criterion 1 . Aged 1879 2 . Male subject female subject take adequate contraception oral contraceptive pill , intra uterine device surgically sterilise postmenopausal Females 3 . BP ≥150 mmHg ( systolic ) OR ≥ 95 mmHg ( diastolic ) . Patients may include PI anticipate BP criterion inclusion meet randomisation 4 . Either nevertreated receive maximum one antihypertensive drug class previous year Patients exclude ANY ONE follow reason 1 . Clinic SBP &gt; 200 mmHg DBP &gt; 120 mmHg , PI discretion override home BP measurement low 2 . Secondary accelerate phase hypertension 3. eGFR &lt; 45 mls/min 4 . Contraindication previous intolerance trial therapy 5 . Failure record require home BP reading placebo runin . 6 . Significant comorbidity ( investigator opinion include alcoholism , terminal illness , document nonattendance clinic etc ) 7 . Diabetes type 1 8 . Plasma K+ outside normal range two successive measurement screen 9 . Requirement treatment ≥2 drug ( CCB and/or { ACEi OR ARB OR direct renin inhibitor OR βblocker } ) order reduce blood pressure ≤180/120 mmHg 10 . Requirement diuretic therapy ( hypertension ) 11 . Requirement ACE inhibitor ( ARB ) therapy ( hypertension ) 12 . Absolute contraindication study drug ( list datasheet ) 13 . Current therapy cancer 14 . Anticipation change medical status course trial ( e.g . plan surgical intervention require &gt; 2 week convalescence , actual plan pregnancy ) 15 . Inability give inform consent 16 . Participation clinical study involve investigational drug device within 4 week screen . 17 . Any concomitant condition , opinion investigator , may adversely affect safety and/or efficacy study drug severely limit subject 's lifespan ability complete study ( eg , alcohol drug abuse , disable terminal illness , mental disorder ) . 18 . Treatment follow prohibited medication : 1 . Oral corticosteroid within 3 month screen . Treatment systemic corticosteroid also prohibit study participation . Chronic stable unstable use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) acetylsalicylic acid prohibit . Chronic use define &gt; 3 consecutive nonconsecutive day treatment per week . In addition , intermittent use NSAIDs strongly discourage throughout duration study . If intermittent treatment require , NSAIDs must use total 2 day . For subject require analgesic antipyretic agent , use paracetamol recommend study participation . 2 . The use shortacting oral nitrate ( eg , sublingual nitroglycerin ) permit ; however , subject take shortacting oral nitrate within 4 hour screen subsequent study visit . 3 . The use longacting oral nitrate ( eg , Isordil ) permit ; however , dose must stable least 2 week prior screen randomisation . 4 . The use sympathomimetic decongestant permit ; however , within 1 day prior clinic visit/BP assessment . 5 . The use theophylline permit ; however , dose must stable least 4 week prior screen throughout study participation . 6 . The use phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) type V inhibitor permit ; however , subject must refrain take medication within 1 day screen subsequent study visit . 7 . The use alphablockers permit exception afluzosin tamsulosin prostatic symptom</criteria>
