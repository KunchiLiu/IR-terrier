	<brief_title>Evaluating Effect Aliskiren Versus HCTZ Coronary Flow Reserve Hypertensive Type II Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study focus diabetic patient already blood pressure-lowering medication ( exclude Tekturna ) addition either ACE inhibitor ARB ( angiotensin receptor blocker ) still blood pressure great 130/80 mm Hg . The purpose study compare effect two different blood pressure treatment regimen , contain three medication , heart function diabetic uncontrolled hypertension . The two treatment 1 ) lisinopril ( ACE inhibitor work reduce blood pressure ) plus amlodipine ( calcium channel blocker reduce blood pressure ) plus aliskiren ( renin inhibitor , also reduce blood pressure ) , 2 ) lisinopril plus amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide ( diuretic , `` water pill '' ) . Participants coronary flow reserve - measure coronary vessel function , predictor future cardiovascular event - number cardiovascular biomarkers blood urine baseline 6 month treatment . In manner hydrochlorothiazide compare aliskiren , researcher think good effect heart artery blood flow .</detailed_description>
