	<brief_summary>The objective test novel paradigm inhibition human preterm uterine contraction . The study hypothesis human preterm contraction safely inhibit weak electrical current provide electrical inhibition/uterine pacemaker device . Preterm birth still major problem . Current method prevent uterine contraction preterm limit associate many side-effects affect mother baby . A reliable method prevent preterm uterine contraction would important discovery . Such method could eventually lead long-term goal decrease neonatal morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Electronic Uterine Contraction Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design Pilot Study confirm safety uterine inhibitor/pacemaker measure effect woman experience preterm labor . A total 10 ( ten ) patient enrol pilot study confirm methodology safety device . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion recruit study . The study device ( EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker ) classify FDA Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) number G080036 , Class A device . The EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device FDA clear research prevention prevention human contraction preterm birth . This proposal initial prospective FDA approve pilot study . After FDA evaluation pilot study finding approval , pilot study may lead eventually prospective randomize control clinical study . Only adult woman experience uterine contraction due birth process eligible . Study patient inform purpose EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device give inform consent prior use . The device use 20 minute , precede follow 20 minute control period . During birth process recording uterine contraction record . Comparison make uterine contraction record pre post use use EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device . The uterine contraction tracing compare analyzed difference frequency contraction . The patient also tell express strength subjective pain manner document questionnaire . Study patient also record type amount pain medication receive noted patient log form . RISK : Previous human animal study indicate minimal risk either baby mother . Human study show effect fetal maternal heart rate . Real-time monitoring fetal maternal heart rate study protect potential risk . BENEFIT : Reducing frequency preterm uterine contraction first step prevent preterm birth , propose investigation , , expect prevent preterm birth . However , investigation could great benefit future mother baby .</detailed_description>
