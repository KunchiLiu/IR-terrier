	<brief_summary>The primary working hypothesis preoperative chemo-sensitivity test use fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) perform one course FOLFOX ( folinic acid , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ) identify patient least likely significant benefit adjuvant FOLFOX stage III colon cancer . The benefit analyze correlate preoperative FDG-PET uptake change disease free overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients histological confirm colon adenocarcinoma compatible clinical stage II III eligible study screen . Receipt sign inform consent study inclusion do within 15 day histological diagnosis . A usual workup preoperative staging colon cancer must do 1 month study inclusion include CEA assessment , positive histological sample colon adenocarcinoma chest abdominal CT scan . After receipt write consent , patient undergoes baseline PET/CT scan donates blood sample CTC SNP analyse . Delay baseline examination histological diagnosis must exceed 21 day . The baseline examination do within 1 week begin first course FOLFOX chemotherapy . Thirteen 15 day chemotherapy , PET/CT blood sample CTC analysis repeat . Standard surgery follow 15 day 30 day Day 1 preoperative chemotherapy . Two frozen tissue core obtain surgery send immediately dry ice ship central Tumour Bank ( Jules Bordet Institute ) store locally -80°C sent batch central tumour bank . Thereafter , patient receive standard care , accord tumour pathological stage . In fully eligible patient , FOLFOX chemotherapy start 45 day surgery . In stage III patient otherwise ineligible , recommendation start FOLFOX chemotherapy within 45 day surgery although patient include primary analysis . Treatment case stage II stage IV colon cancer leave investigator 's discretion . Eleven course adjuvant FOLFOX foreseen , order match usual recommendation come Mosaic Trial . Follow-up procedure completion adjuvant treatment follow standard European clinical recommendation stage II III patient . Clinical follow-up data obtain patient , include stage II disease , minimum follow-up time three year .</detailed_description>
