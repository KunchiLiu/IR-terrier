	<brief_title>Vorinostat Bortezomib Treating Young Patients With Refractory Recurrent Solid Tumors , Including Central Nervous System Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommend phase II dose vorinostat combination bortezomib pediatric patient refractory recurrent solid tumor , include central nervous system tumor lymphoma . II . To define describe toxicity regimen patient . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity regimen within confines phase I study . II . To assess biologic activity bortezomib measure NF-κB activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . III . To assess biologic activity bortezomib measure endoplasmic reticulum stress response use GRP78 molecular chaperone marker PBMC . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-5 8-12 bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline course 1 study analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow within 30 day .</detailed_description>
