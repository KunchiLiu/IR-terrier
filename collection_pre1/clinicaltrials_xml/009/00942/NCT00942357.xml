	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin paclitaxel see well work without cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient stage I-IVA endometrial cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether carboplatin paclitaxel effective without cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Cisplatin Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IVA Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment cisplatin volume-directed radiation follow carboplatin paclitaxel 4 cycle ( experimental arm ) reduce rate recurrence death ( i.e. , increase recurrence-free survival ) compare chemotherapy consist carboplatin paclitaxel 6 cycle ( control arm ) patient stag III-IVA endometrial carcinoma ( &lt; 2 cm residual disease ) patient International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) 2009 stage I II serous ( uterine papillary serous carcinoma [ UPSC ] ) clear cell endometrial carcinoma positive cytology . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment cisplatin volume-directed radiation follow carboplatin paclitaxel 4 cycle ( experimental arm ) reduce rate death ( i.e. , increase survival ) compare chemotherapy consist carboplatin paclitaxel 6 cycle ( control arm ) patient stag III-IVA endometrial carcinoma ( &lt; 2 cm residual disease ) patient FIGO 2009 stage I II serous ( UPSC ) clear cell endometrial carcinoma positive cytology . II . To compare regimen respect acute late adverse effect therapy . III . To determine impact patient-reported quality life follow treatment 1 year two treatment regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue whole blood specimens future research . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 29 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily ( QD ) , 5 day week , 5-6 week . Some patient may undergo brachytherapy 2-3 week . Beginning within 8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
