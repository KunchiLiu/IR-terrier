	<brief_summary>One third patient kidney cancer diagnose metastatic stage , among patient localized form , 30 40 % develop metastases surgery . Medical treatment metastatic renal cancer include immunotherapy interferon Î± and/or IL-2 , targeted therapy anti-angiogenic ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , anti-tyrosine kinase inhibitor m-TOR ) . These treatment sometimes associate ( IL2 + INF INF AntiVEGF ) allow objective response 15 30 % case ( net benefit target therapy ) , carrier potentially significant side effect expensive . The treatment response consider imaging exam repetitive , costly inconsistently reliable . A serum marker tumor development would particularly welcome . CA9 oncogene also know CA IX , carbonic anhydrase 9 MN/CA9 . The gene encode oncoprotein call indifferently membrane antigen MN , MN/CA9 isoenzyme , carbonic anhydrase IX CA9 , G250/MN/CA9 protein G250 . It demonstrate level expression CA9 tumor tissue use predictive marker response immunotherapy . In previous study , investigator try use CA9 improve differential diagnosis kidney tumor use tumor biopsy fine needle aspiration . More recently , investigator develop ELISA quantitative reat time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) study CA9 protein CA9 mRNA serum patient non-metastatic kidney cancer . The investigator thus show CA9 overexpressed prior surgery expression disappear tumor ablation .</brief_summary>
