	<brief_summary>Information blood sample may help u choose best treatment future personalize medicine . Natalizumab ( NTZ ) current treatment MS use second line therapy suboptimal response disease modify drug . When introduce NTZ consensual . The investigator hypothesize biological information could rationalize choice thus design prospective open label trial test biological marker treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Response Natalizumab Multiple Sclerosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current state knowledge topic project The general interest project ; Pharmacogenomic aim determine biomarkers related treatment response , step toward patient-tailored medicine . Natalizumab , monoclonal antibody receive EMEA approval MS patient respond interferon treatment experience severe disease course . Efficacy drug outstanding 37 % patient complete `` disease free '' definition 2 year ( 7 % placebo group ) . On hand , natalizumab may associate severe adverse event progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy high cost . Overall , emphasize need beyond current approval criterion identify patient best efficacy safety ratio , major public health issue . Scientific aim The primary scientific aim define biomarkers would allow predict long term response natalizumab . Methodology ; The investigator plan conduct 5 year study search best predict factor begin treatment 2 year . In grant application investigator perform multivariate analysis clinical , MRI , biological marker ( neutralize antibody , DNA , mRNA expression ) baseline 2 year . For feasibility reason , long term follow ( 5 year ) proteomics study perform second stage .</detailed_description>
