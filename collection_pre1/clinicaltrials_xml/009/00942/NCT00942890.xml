	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize control study determine administer neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) thigh muscle knee amputee effective current standard care preserve thigh muscle strength . In addition , study examine NMES treatment effect participant 's gait , quality life , functional performance standing , walk , stair climbing , symptom associate residual phantom limb pain . The primary aim compare NMES plus standard rehabilitation ( treatment group ) standard rehabilitation ( control group ) measure low extremity muscle strength . The secondary aim compare NMES treatment group control group measure Quality Life ( QOL ) symptom associate residual &amp; phantom limb pain . In addition specific aim , study also examine two group functional performance gait pattern prosthetic fitting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic amputation one major injury see result Operation Iraqi Enduring Freedom majority single trans-tibial amputation ( TTA ) . TTA experience significant reduction thigh muscle strength amputate limb first year amputation . The residual limb less active daily function stand walking , result progressive atrophy quadriceps muscle term decrease thigh diameter estimate 25 % pre-amputation diameter . An intervention may useful TTA rehabilitation neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) . The overall objective study test two different approach prosthetic rehabilitation potential treatment improve muscle strength , pain functional performance daily activity military personnel TTA . Our central hypothesis Nurse Managed NMES rehabilitation program great improvement muscle strength pain compare standard rehabilitation protocol alone . The rationale study NMES could additive effect Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) standard care program great improvement muscle strength thus enhance performance daily activity , Quality Life ( QOL ) , decrease disability . Such outcome ultimately result decreased economic cost , accelerate rehabilitation , potentially increase possibility warrior return duty . The specific aim test Nurse Managed NMES relative standard rehabilitation comparing : ( 1 ) Lower extremity muscle strength ; ( 2 ) QOL ; ( 3 ) Symptoms associate phantom pain . In addition aim , specific aim post prosthetic phase intervention compare two group ( 4 ) functional performance daily activity . After pre-testing , participant age 18 55 yr traumatic TTA randomly assign either 1 ) Nurse Managed NMES rehabilitation program ( n=30 ) ; 2 ) WRAMC Amputee Protocol ( n=30 ) . Those NMES group receive 12 week electrical muscle stimulation 15 min/day , 5 day week 12 week . Both group receive standard 12-week Walter Reed Army Medical Center rehabilitation protocol . Generalized Estimating Equation method use build regression model statistical analysis longitudinal data . The significance research Nurse Managed NMES may important accelerate rehabilitation amputee achieve functional independence regain lose muscle strength preparation return duty .</detailed_description>
