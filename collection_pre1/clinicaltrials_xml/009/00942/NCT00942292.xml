	<brief_title>The Effect Fish Oils Human Hepatic Colorectal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fish oil many proven benefit wide range clinical arena ischaemic heart disease , rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease . Recent research describe beneficial effect intravenous fish oil surgical patient , reduce hospital stay , reduce re-operation rate reduce requirement intravenous antibiotic . These part due anti-inflammatory effect fish oil . There evidence fish oil also effective cancer , large population study indicate diet rich omega-3 associate low incidence cancer , vitro animal study demonstrate anti-tumour effect fish oil 1 . Fish oil inhibit growth different human cancer cell line 2 . They act specifically tumour cell impair function normal cell 3 . EPA DHA inhibit growth human cancer cell line enhance apoptosis . 4 . Fish oil induces apoptosis human colorectal cancer cell line in-vitro 48hrs incubation 5 . Fish oil show inhibit proliferation activity , inhibit invasive activity increase apoptosis human pancreatic carcinoma cell line in-vitro 48hrs exposure 6 . Fish oil show enhance colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line sensitivity radiotherapy 7 . Fish oil also show reduce incidence liver metastases experimentally induced ductal pancreatic cancer rat 30 week oral treatment omega-3 supplement diet . 8 . Lung cancer xenograft animal feed fish oil show significantly increase tumour regression response doxorubicin compare fed omega-3 . This study aim assess effect omega-3 FA upon hepatic colorectal metastasis pilot study . 20 patient select pilot study potentially resectable hepatic colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis . 10 patient receive total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) without fish oil ( control ) , 10 receive fish oil contain lipid emulsion TPN . Changes tumour angiogenesis ( increased angiogenesis associate poor prognosis hepatic colorectal metastasis ) investigate use digital contrast enhance MRI scanning , marker angiogenesis investigate blood resect tumour sample patient . It randomise control double blind trial .</detailed_description>
