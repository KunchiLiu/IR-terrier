	<brief_title>A Study Test Benefit New Anti-cancer Treatment Patients With Unresectable Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient receive maximum 24 dos recMAGE-A3 + AS15 accord four cycle period four year . An active follow-phase ( five year registration study ) plan patient . As Amendment 2 , longer active follow-up patient discontinuation completion treatment . The study end approximately 30 day last dose administer . In addition , biological sample collect protocol research purpose . For biological sample already collect scope study test yet , test perform default , except scientific rationale remain relevant . Blood sample safety monitoring per protocol continue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient histologically proven metastatic cutaneous melanoma measurable . Patients regional distant cutaneous , subcutaneous lymphnode metastasis include study , provide disease amenable curative treatment surgery . In term AJCC 2002 classification , include patient unresectable stage III melanoma include intransit metastasis patient stage IV M1a melanoma . Written inform consent obtain patient prior performance study specific procedure . Patient &gt; = 18 year time signature inform consent form . The patient 's tumor show expression MAGEA3 , determine RTPCR analysis fresh tumor tissue sample obtain screen phase . Fresh tissue lesion use MAGEA3 expression test must available test predictive gene signature . Formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tissue must available complementary MAGEA3 gene signature test . Patient fully recover previous intervention ( i.e. , biopsy ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Adequate bonemarrow reserve , adequate renal function adequate hepatic function assess standard laboratory criterion If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception least 30 day prior registration trial , negative pregnancy test continue precaution entire study treatment period 2 month completion injection series . In opinion investigator , patient comply protocol requirement . Patients unresectable stage IV M1b , c melanoma patient ocular mucosal melanoma . The patient time receive systemic anticancer treatment . Prior systemic treatment immunomodulator locoregional radiotherapy permit prior adjuvant treatment provide last dose administer least 30 day registration trial ; Previous adjuvant treatment cancer vaccine contain tumor antigen MAGEA3 allow last administration take place least 8 week registration trial . Prior isolate limb perfusion permit provide last dose administer least 30 day registration trial The patient schedule receive anticancer specific treatment , include radiotherapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy immunomodulating agent . The patient require concomitant chronic treatment ( 7 consecutive day ) systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent . The patient history autoimmune disease , limited , multiple sclerosis , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients vitiligo exclude . The patient family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . The patient know positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component ASCI treatment . The patient previous concomitant malignancy site , except effectively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix effectively treat malignancy remission 5 year highly likely cure . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder The patient uncontrolled bleed disorder . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study medication within 30 day precede first investigational treatment injection plan use study period . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , patient expose investigational noninvestigational product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . For female patient : patient pregnant lactating .</criteria>
