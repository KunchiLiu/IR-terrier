	<brief_summary>Background : - Some illness , schizophrenia , effect brain cell call dopamine receptor , require normal brain function . People schizophrenia difficulty think experience hallucination delusion . Medications change brain dopamine receptor decrease hallucination delusion . - The cause schizophrenia association brain dopamine receptor know may clarify study dopamine receptor people dopamine disorder ( schizophrenia ) . Researchers interested study dopamine system gain good idea dopamine disorder develop , may lead good medical care people schizophrenia . Objectives : - To study amount distribution two type dopamine receptor . Eligibility : - Individuals age 18 60 schizophrenia . - Healthy volunteer age 18 90 . Design : - Participants undergo full screening , physical psychological history , neurological examination , blood urine sample . - Participants blood flow map brain record positron emission tomography ( PET ) brain scan . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan also perform determine brain anatomy . - To study amount distribution dopamine receptor brain , participant receive small amount radioactive chemical vein , follow PET scan . - The procedure perform twice two separate session , [ 18F ] fallypride [ 11C ] NNC-112 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Dopaminergic ( DA ) modulation brain function disturb several disable psychiatric disorder represent target key psychopharmacologic agent , neuroleptic . Schizophrenia consider prototype dysregulated DA signaling , associate prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) dysfunction . Prevailing view attribute key symptom schizophrenia deficient DA signaling within mesocortical DA tract . Little known , however , pre- , intra- , post-synaptic process contribute dopaminergic dysregulation . Regional cortical DA activity , critical process , difficult measure patient available image technique . The current clinical study aim address open issue take advantage two recently develop positron emission tomography ( PET ) radioligands , [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC-112 [ ( 18 ) F ] Fallypride , bind differentially high bind potential ( BP ) previous compound D ( 1 ) ( NNC-112 ) D ( 2/3 ) ( fallypride ) receptor . By measure regional BP two compound , cortical subcortical DA receptor anomaly characterize schizophrenia . Within Clinical Brain Disorders Branch ( CBDB ) , PET protocol expect add crucial information DA receptor status ongoing regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , magneto-encephalography ( MEG ) genetic study . It lead improved understanding modulatory influence DA frontal lobe function facilitate study genetic polymorphism interact regional change D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor increase risk schizophrenia . Some specific hypothesis test follow : D1 BP frontal cortex affect age , elevate schizophrenia inversely correlate cognitive performance patient healthy control . Cortical D2/3 receptor BP affect age inversely correlate performance test frontal lobe function patient healthy control . Striatal D2/3 receptor BP alter patient . Polymorphisms catechol-O-methyl transferase ( COMT ) , D1 D2 gene well schizophrenia risk gene affect DA receptor BP frontal cortex . The ratio cortical D1 D2/3 receptor BPs affect age relate risk schizophrenia , cognitive performance polymorphism COMT gene schizophrenia risk gene STUDY POPULATION It include 50 patient schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder psychotic disorder age 18-55 , 150 healthy control , age 18-90 . Fifty control matched patient age sex . DESIGN Dopamine D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor regional binding potential ( BP ) quantify PET medication-free patient control . High resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan obtain co-registration purpose . Additionally , enrollment ongoing protocol ( 00-M-0085 , 90-M-0014 , 01-M-0232 , 95-M-0150 , 89-M-0160 ) , rCBF , functional MRI , cognitive genetic data obtain compare D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor BP data obtain protocol . OUTCOME MEASURES Brain dopamine D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor regional binding potential measure [ [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC-112 [ ( 18 ) F ] Fallypride PET .</detailed_description>

Patients 18 60 year age . Healthy control match age sex patient . Control subject must healthy base history , laboratory physical exam obtain mention protocol include age 90 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ( patient control except indicate ) Subjects exclude fit study requirement regard age , ability provide inform consent , absence significant general medical , neurological psychiatric disorder ( except disorder object study ) , intake substance interfere central dopaminergic signaling . Current psychiatric illness except patient schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder psychotic disorder Controls current prior use ( abuse ) substances interfere central dopaminergic signaling ( e.g . antipsychotic , dopamine receptor agonist , catecholomethyltransferase inhibitor , anticholinergic , MAOB inhibitor ) except patient antipsychotic psychotropic agent discontinue least 4 week protocol 89M0160 . Controls current psychiatric illness schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , psychotic disorder Secondary cause schizophrenialike syndrome , e.g . amphetamine abuse , brain infarction , tumor , trauma Neurological disorder except exclusively peripheral location Significant prior current substance abuse , severe systemic disease , hypothyroidism compensate medication Laboratory test clinically significant abnormality History significantly abnormal EEG , cranial CT MRI Conditions increase risk MRI ( pacemaker device , ferromagnetic metal implant , etc . ) Prior participation research protocols radiation exposure would exceed annual NIH RSC limit Any medical condition , opinion investigator , would interfere safe conduct study .</criteria>
