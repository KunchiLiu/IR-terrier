	<brief_title>Trial RAD001 Erlotinib With Recurrent Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : RAD001 design stop cancer cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 1 RAD001 tablet 1 erlotinib hydrochloride tablet every day 28 day study `` cycle '' . Both drug take time , mouth , cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You take drug least 1 hour 2 hour eat . You take study drug around time day . Your eat habit around time take drug stay study . lf vomit , take another tablet next schedule dose . Tell doctor side effect , dose ( ) study drug ( ) may lower stop day . You may give drug help reduce risk side effect . Study Visits : On Day 1 ( +/- 3 day ) cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , may blood test often . On Day 1 ( +/- 3 day ) every evenly numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , CT scan MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : When go study reason , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You CT scan MRI scan check status disease . Follow-Up : You call within 30 day end-of-study visit ask possible side effect may . The call take 5 minute . This investigational study . RAD001 FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type breast cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride FDA approve commercially available treatment advance non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) advance pancreatic cancer . The use drug combination treatment HNSCC investigational . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
