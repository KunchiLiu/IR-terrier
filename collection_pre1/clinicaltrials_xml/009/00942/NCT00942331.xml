	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study gemcitabine hydrochloride , cisplatin , bevacizumab see well work compare gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin treat patient urinary tract cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin effective give without bevacizumab treat patient urinary tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Cisplatin With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient advanced transitional cell carcinoma treat bevacizumab , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) cisplatin increase overall survival compare patient treated gemcitabine , cisplatin , placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival two regimen patient advance transitional cell carcinoma . II . To compare proportion patient experience objective response regimen . III . To compare grade 3 great toxicity patient treat two regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 , cisplatin IV , placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive placebo IV 30-90 minute every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 7 year .</detailed_description>
