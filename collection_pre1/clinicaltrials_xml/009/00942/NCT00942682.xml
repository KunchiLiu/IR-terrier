	<brief_title>Sorafenib Combination With RAD001 Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant neuroendocrine tumor , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant give depend number participant enrol study . - Each treatment cycle last 28 day . Participants take RAD001 orally day morning . Participants take sorafenib orally twice daily . - Initially participants come clinic every week . At visit bloodwork take monitor participant health . Every 2 month treatment , participant CT scan MRI do see medication work . - Participants remain research study long continue benefit study medication .</detailed_description>
