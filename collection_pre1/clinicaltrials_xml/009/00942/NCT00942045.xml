	<brief_summary>This prospective , non-randomized multi-center study compare use Osteocel Plus subject receive ACDF surgery one two level . These subject present degenerative condition cervical spine amenable surgical treatment screen prior study enrollment . Subjects receive Osteocel Plus , without biologic product , ACDF operation . The ACDF procedure conduct radiolucent graft containment device progression fusion adequately assess via radiograph . Subjects follow 24-months following surgery determine number study subject solidly fuse 24 month postoperatively , determine mean time fusion . This data compare publish and/or retrospective data autograft , synthetic ceramic Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OsteocelÂ® Plus Anterior Cervical Discectomy Fusion ( ACDF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 175 subject select enrollment study multiple center . The subject degenerative condition cervical spine undergo ACDF surgery treatment one two level . The following eligibility criterion design select subject protocol treatment consider appropriate . All relevant medical non-medical condition take consideration decide whether protocol suitable particular subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Persistent neck and/or arm pain unresponsive conservative treatment least 6 week , unless clinically indicated sooner 2 . Indicated anterior fusion one two contiguous cervical level ( C3 T1 ) 3 . Objective evidence primary diagnosis must confirm appropriate imaging study 4 . 1870 year age date write informed consent 5 . Able undergo surgery base physical exam , medical history surgeon judgment 6 . Expected survive least 2 year beyond surgery 7 . Willing able return posttreatment exam accord followup call protocol 8 . Signed date Informed Consent Form 1 . Patient mental physical condition would limit ability comply study requirement 2 . Cervical spine abnormality require treatment two level 3 . Systemic local infection ; active latent 4 . Previous fail fusion operative level 5 . Diseases significantly inhibit bone healing ( osteoporosis , metabolic bone disease , uncontrolled diabetes , dialysis dependent renal failure , symptomatic liver disease ) 6 . Undergoing chemotherapy radiation treatment , chronic use steroid ( define 6 week steroid use within 12 month surgery , episodic use inhaled corticosteroid ) 7 . Pregnant , plan become pregnant study 8 . Subject prisoner 9 . Involvement active litigation relate spine ( worker 's compensation claim allow contend ) 10 . A significant general illness ( e.g. , HIV , active metastatic cancer type ) present ; subject immunocompromised treated immunosuppressive agent decrease probability survival twoyear endpoint study 11 . Participating another clinical study time study participation would confound study data</criteria>
