	<brief_summary>The propose study prospective cohort study incorporate patient first recurrence ovarian primary peritoneal cancer receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy conjunction whole abdomen radiation . The primary end point investigator initiate research study determine toxicity associate whole abdomen radiation combination intraperitoneal chemotherapy . Primary Objective : - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) whole abdomen radiation conjunction intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy treatment woman small volume ( &lt; 1 cm ) recurrent ovarian cancer confine abdominal peritoneal cavity . Secondary Objective : - Quality Life assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Abdomen Radiation Conjunction With Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Treatment Small Volume Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma Limited Peritoneal Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN : This open label , single arm , dose find study . STUDY PROCEDURES : Patients receive chemotherapy radiation four week , check problem treatment 3 month . We would like collect information patient regular doctor 1 year treatment . Pre-screening If patient decide participate study doctor evaluate meet criterion eligible . To participate cancer spread outside abdomen patient must one type chemotherapy cancer . If previous scan blood test show cancer spread outside abdominal cavity , patient able participate study . Patients also able participate study determine cancer come back less six month complete first treatment chemotherapy . If criterion meet , standard next step treatment second surgery remove cancer abdominal cavity . This involve similar surgery patient cancer first diagnose . During surgery place special catheter tube within abdominal cavity administer chemotherapy abdomen directly deliver remain cancer . Screening Procedures : The follow screening test , exam procedure do : - Recording medical history , physical exam ( include vital sign , height &amp; weight assessment , pelvic examination ) - Blood test ( approximately 2-3 teaspoon drawn ) - Urine test - Quality life questionnaire - If patient history hearing loss , hear test cisplatin affect hearing . Chemotherapy Radiation Treatment : - Chemotherapy ( Cisplatin ) give recovery surgery . It give per week time patient begin receive radiation treatment first 4 week . The chemotherapy give catheter ( tube ) place skin surgery visible . Patients receive medication prior chemotherapy prevent nausea , vomit , possible allergic reaction . Each infusion chemotherapy take approximately 60 minute . After patient receive drug ask change position ensure drug come contact part abdomen . - Radiation therapy administer four week . Radiation treatment give every day ( Monday Friday ) approximately four week . - Weekly blood test take patient receive chemotherapy ( approximately 2-3 teaspoon ) monitor effect drug body . - The study doctor evaluate patient weekly physical exam review blood test side effect might chemotherapy radiation treatment . - Complete quality life questionnaire week . At end treatment ( begin week 5 ) AND approximately 90 day completion treatment patient physical exam , blood test evaluation side effect , complete quality life questionnaire . At end treatment , patient likely undergo additional standard chemotherapy treatment . We would like collect review information progress care 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Recurrent ovarian cancer primary peritoneal cancer disease confine abdomen pelvis , undergone optimal cytoreductive surgery recurrence 2 . Must receive one prior chemotherapeutic regimen prior therapy 3 . Eligible patient must receive platinum base intravenous chemotherapy prior therapy . Previous treatment maintenance chemotherapy initial adjuvant chemotherapy acceptable , include antiestrogen therapy growth factor . Previous intraperitoneal chemotherapy allow 4 . Patients evidence recurrent cancer manifest either ) elevation serum CA125 palpable tumor physical exam and/or b ) radiographic evidence recurrence . ( Note tissue biopsy histologic confirmation tumor recurrence prior cytoreductive surgery necessary , however histologic confirmation remove tumor necessary see exclusion 5.22 ) 5 . Tumors serous , mucinous , clear cell , endometrioid histologic type eligible 6 . Recurrent disease must confine abdominal cavity 7 . Recurrence tumor must great six month completion primary chemotherapy ( platinum sensitive ovarian cancer ) 8 . Patients undergone second cytoreductive surgery remove gross residual disease . This cytoreductive surgery must occur within twelve week enrollment 9 . Patients plan IP catheter 10 . Patients require rectosigmoid resection primary anastamosis eligible 11 . Adequate renal function define serum creatinine le 2.0mg/dL 12 . Patients must appropriate hematologic parameter total white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3,000cells/mcl platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcl prior treatment initiation 13 . Patients must absence pleural effusion chest radiograph 14 . Patients must sign informed consent approve University Utah institutional review board ( IRB ) 15 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 16 . Age great 18 year old 1 . Patients previously characterize stage IV disease stage IIIC underwent suboptimal secondary cytoreductive surgery recurrence eligible participation 2 . Patients undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery recurrence recurrent disease histologic documentation eligible 3 . Those preoperative evaluation consistent stage IV disease ( pleural effusion liver parenchymal disease ) 4 . Patients disease outside peritoneal cavity include disease thorax , within parenchyma liver , spleen , retroperitoneal nodal disease eligible participation 5 . Patients invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , ( ) evidence cancer present within last 5 year whose previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy 6 . Patients determine platinum resistant ovarian primary peritoneal cancer 7 . Those suboptimal cytoreductive surgery time first diagnosis . This include patient suboptimal cytoreductive surgery follow chemotherapy , secondary debulking recurrence 8 . Those &gt; 1cm residual disease second cytoreductive surgery 9 . Patients treat previous intraperitoneal chemotherapy 10 . Patients pregnant lactate 11 . Patients peripheral neuropathy great grade 2 baseline</criteria>
