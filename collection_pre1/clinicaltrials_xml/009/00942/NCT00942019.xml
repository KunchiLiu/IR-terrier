	<brief_summary>The investigator want ass difference lung function bronchial inflammation young smoker non-smokers ( BMI &gt; 30 ) without obesity ( BMI &lt; 25 ) ( 4 patient group ) . The aim study compare difference lung function ( VC , FEV1 , VC/FEV1 , metacholine challenge ) bronchial inflammation relation smoke history level exhale CO. For latter investigator analyze level IL-8 , IL-6 , TNF alpha INF gamma mRNA LBP , TLR2 TLR4 sputum . Further , inflammatory marker e.g . low CRP inflammatory cytokine level blood investigate . The aim describe early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cause cigarette smoke juvenile smoker , relationship bronchial inflammation obesity adolescent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tobacco smoke crucial factor begin course bronchial inflammation lead COPD . It show cigarette smoke vitro lead MAP kinase NF-κB-dependent increase pro-inflammatory cytokine , inhibit bacteria-induced expression β-defensins . Several study reveal increase inflammatory cytokine like IL-8 TNF sputum smoker . Further study demonstrate regulation LTB4 LBP possibly due LPS derive tobacco smoke . Hasday et al could show 15 ng per cigarette LPS release . In principle , cigarette smoke exposure like mild LPS inhalation . In separate work , could show LPS inhalation healthy non-smokers increase CRP LBP concentration serum lead . In another study adolescent , 24 smoker ( age 17.7 year ) 24 non-smoking ( age 17.5 year ) compare . The CO smoker significantly increase , NO concentration decrease . At time significantly great bronchial hyperreagibility smoker group . According recent study Germany ( KiGGS study ) , already 31 % adolescent ' boy 32 % girl smoke . The social status great importance . Boys girls family low social status smoke frequently family middle-and especially high social status . Similarly obesity link social status overweight occur often family lower social status . A visceral obesity closely associate risk type-2-diabetes well aspects metabolic syndrome . However , exist insulin resistance fundamental importance . Due increase visceral fat depot subsequently increase release proinflammatory proteins various complication occur .</detailed_description>
