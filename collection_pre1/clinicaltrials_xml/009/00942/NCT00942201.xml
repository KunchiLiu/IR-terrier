	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : A 2-day course oral dexamethasone superior option resolution symptom prevention relapse emergency department ( ED ) management mild-moderate asthma exacerbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Oral Dexamethasone Doses Asthma Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma become major public health problem increase concern US prevalent chronic disease childhood 6 million child age 17 affect 7 . Low-income population , minority , child live inner city experience disproportionately high morbidity mortality due asthma . Children suffer asthma often present ED outpatient center management symptoms exacerbation . Asthma related ED visit 2004 estimate 1.8 million , child young 17 accounting almost half 754,000 visit 7 Recent clinical trial show efficacy dexamethasone ED management asthma . In Quereshi et al , randomize study 533 patient show two dos DEX take day 1 2 equally efficacious 5 day prednisolone2 . However , patient treat DEX demonstrate improved compliance less vomiting , few miss day school few miss parental workday . A recent study Altamimi et al compare single dose DEX 5-day prednisolone1 . This double blind , randomize prospective study 134 child conclude single dose DEX worse 5 day prednisolone well.dexamethasone acute management asthma exacerbation . However , practice vary use single dose , two-day dosing administer second dose . The purpose study compare various dose regime dexamethasone efficacy treatment asthma exacerbation . Given long duration action DEX ( 36-72 hour ) , hypothesize 2 dos DEX give day 1 &amp; 3 superior single dose DEX improve symptom prevent relapse ED management mild moderate asthma exacerbation . These previous study show similar efficacy dexamethasone compare standard 5-day prednisone/prednisolone treatment . . Within institution , investigator incorporate use dexamethasone management acute asthma exacerbation . However , practice vary use single dose , two-day dose time second dose patient receive two dos dexamethasone . The purpose study determine single dose oral dexamethasone effective 2 dose course oral dexamethasone prevent relapse within 7 day pediatric asthma patient manage ED . Given long half life dexamethasone , investigator hypothesize 2 dos give day 1 3 superior single dose improve symptom prevent relapse ED management mild moderate asthma exacerbation .</detailed_description>
