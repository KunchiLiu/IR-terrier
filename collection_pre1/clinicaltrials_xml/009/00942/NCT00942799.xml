	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study design ass safety tolerability Genz-644282 , administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion , patient advance malignant solid tumor . Each 28 day cycle treatment consist 3 consecutive week treatment every 28 day ( i.e. , treatment administer Days 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day ) . Each 21 day cycle treatment consist 2 consecutive week treatment every 21 day ( i.e. , treatment administer Days 1 8 every 21 day ) . Treatment Genz-644282 continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity observe . Approximately 110 patient enrol study . Patients enrol escalate dose cohort Maximum Tolerated Doses ( MTDs ) 2 dose schedule establish . To evaluate safety , approximately 40 additional patient advance malignant solid tumor enrol treated MTDs ( 20 dose schedule ) expansion phase .</brief_summary>
