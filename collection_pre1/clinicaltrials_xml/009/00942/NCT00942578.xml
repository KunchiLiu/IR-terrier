	<brief_summary>Background : - Prednisone docetaxel use successfully treat patient prostate cancer , either use alone combination agent . Researchers believe anticancer effect increase give specific combination . - A previous study National Cancer Institute combine docetaxel prednisone bevacizumab thalidomide . The result study promise ; however , patient study require dose reduction thalidomide side effect . - Lenalidomide , drug similar thalidomide , may less severe side effect . Based previous study , lenalidomide well tolerated patient solid tumor use alone combination docetaxel , may good substitute thalidomide . Objectives : - To determine lenalidomide appropriate effective substitute thalidomide treat prostate cancer . - To evaluate safety effectiveness bevacizumab , lenalidomide , docetaxel , prednisone prostate cancer treatment , study side effect . Eligibility : - Men 18 year age old diagnose metastatic prostate cancer respond standard treatment , include surgical removal testicle treatment androgen ( sex-hormone ) suppress drug . Design : - Participants complete medical history physical examination begin study . - Patients treat 21-day cycle combination four drug : - ( 1 ) Docetaxel , give vein 60 minute first day 21-day cycle . Patients take dexamethasone ( steroid agent ) take docetaxel . - ( 2 ) Prednisone , take mouth daily . - ( 3 ) Bevacizumab , give vein 30 90 minute first day 21-day cycle follow infusion docetaxel . - ( 4 ) Lenalidomide , take mouth first 2 week 21-day cycle . The dose lenalidomide may adjust side effect develop . - Patients also receive enoxaparin , subcutaneous injection administer daily , prevent blood clot and/or pegfilgrastim , subcutaneous injection day 2 cycle , improve white blood cell count , direct researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial Bevacizumab , Lenalidomide , Docetaxel , Prednisone ( ART-P ) Treatment Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The dual antiangiogenic therapy bevacizumab thalidomide combination docetaxel prednisone ( ATTP ) highly active patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , associate unprecedented result ( 90 % patient PSA decline great equal 50 % 64 % ORR measurable disease ) . Most patient ATTP trial require dose reduction due thalidomide toxicity . Lenalidomide , analogue thalidomide , possess antiangiogenesis inhibition TNF-alpha , favorable toxicity profile . Lenalidomide well tolerate patient solid tumor use alone combination docetaxel . To preserve efficacy ATTP potentially reduce toxicity , lenalidomide may good substitute thalidomide . Objectives Primary : To assess lenalidomide approve dose schedule safely combine docetaxel , bevacizumab , prednisone patient mCRPC ( le 25 % Grade 4 toxicity ) To evaluate efficacy combination Eligibility : Patients progressive mCRPC receive chemotherapy antiangiogenic therapy mCRPC Design : A single-stage Phase 2 study , early stop rule excessive toxicity : goal enroll 45 patient 25-mg dose level lenalidomide . However , 7 first 18 few patient receive lenalidomide 25 mg develop grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity anytime study , patient enrol . With respect stop rule , grade 4 hematologic toxicity consider episode last great equal 5 day . Grade 4 lymphopenia duration count . If less 7 first 18 patient experience level toxicity , accrual continue 45 patient enrol 25 mg dose level lenalidomide . A run-in phase lenalidomide 15 mg conduct first three patient 20mg next three patient assess tolerability within combination prior dose 25 mg thereafter . An expansion cohort low dose lenalidomide ( 15 mg ) combination docetaxel Avastin conduct ass low dose lenalidomide could similar efficacy less toxicity . Treatment Schema ART-P Dex -Dexamethasone 8 mg. po 12 hour pre , 3 hour pre , 1 hour pre infusion docetaxel ( patient prior regimen include low dose decadron reaction increase decadron 8 mg dose ) Len - Lenalidomide 25 mg po , day 1-14 . Lenalidomide 15 mg 20mg propose run-in phase . Lenalidomide 15 mg expansion cohort . Doc - Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV Bev - Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV Pre - Prednisone 10 mg PO daily throughout cycle E - Enoxaparin give SQ daily base weight ( see dose chart section 4.2 ) Peg - Pegfilgrastim 6mg SQ give least 24 hour docetaxel administration Baseline screen evaluation conduct within 15 day prior protocol enrollment . Baseline scan x-ray must perform 4 week prior protocol enrollment . Patients must evaluate NCI clinic cycle treatment continuation . Staging scan perform first 2 cycle treatment every three cycle . All follow-up evaluation do last week prior cycle .</detailed_description>
