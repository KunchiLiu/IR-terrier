	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year . Males must able willing use adequate contraceptive method throughout treatment followup phase study . Females must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , female subject reproductive potential , willing agree use 2 acceptable method birth control throughout treatment phase study , least one barrier method . 2 . Allogeneic HSCT recipient CMV seropositive transplantation ( i.e. , R+ patient ) . 3 . Recipients less 30 day post qualify transplant . [ Note : Under extreme circumstance due time issue associate logistics , patient may enrol , i.e.receive first dose study drug , Day 32 posttransplant . Sites must first contact Chimerix Medical Monitor receive permission FDD Days 31 32 posttransplant . ] 4 . Recipients must evidence engraftment randomization receive first dose study drug . Evidence engraftment define one following : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) increase 3 consecutive day count ≥ 500 cells/mm3 third day OR Three ( 3 ) consecutive day ANC ≥ 500 cells/mm3 . [ Notes : For site standard site practice monitor white blood count ( WBC ) early transplant oppose ANC , engraftment define WBC increase 3 consecutive day ANC ≥ 500 cell/mm3 third day . For nonmyeloablative reducedintensity transplant ( i.e. , minitransplants ) ANC fall 500 cells/mm3 , site definition engraftment use . ] Able ingest absorb oral medication ( judgment investigator base lack significant GI event ) . [ Note : Use TPN ( total parenteral nutrition ) exclusionary long reason use would disqualify patient base criterion . ] 6 . Willing able understand provide write informed consent . 7 . To best knowledge , willing able participate require study activity duration study . 1 . Females pregnant currently nurse . 2 . Patients BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 . 3 . Patients hypersensitivity cidofovir CMX001 . 4 . Recipients current , predose clinical course CMV infection suggest investigator would able withhold treatment CMV minimum 5 , preferably 7 day follow subject 's first dose study drug . [ Note : Patients , high probability , able first efficacy assessment CMV infection enrol study . That , investigator enroll recipient increase CMV viral load predose , PI 's opinion , continuation along clinical course would result discontinuation ( due requirement CMV treatment prohibit medication ) within first week . ] 5 . Recipients receive follow : • GCV , vGCV , foscarnet CDV within 14 day prior enrollment ; • antiCMV therapy follow transplantation ( include Cytogam®1 ) , CMV vaccine , investigational drug antiviral activity dsDNA virus within 14 day prior enrollment , [ Note : An investigational drug define drug approve indication FDA . ] investigational drug ( i.e. , without `` antidsDNA virus '' activity ; example , antiinfluenza compound ) within 14 day prior enrollment without prior write consent medical monitor . Patients receive high dose ACV ( &gt; 2000 mg total oral daily dose &gt; 5 mg/kg IV three time daily ) vACV ( Valtrex ; &gt; 3000 mg total daily dose ) time dose . [ Note : These dos patient normal renal function ; patient dose reduce FDD exclude study . ] 7 . Patients active CMV disease diagnose within 6 month prior enrollment ; patient CMV DNAemia require intervention antiviral therapy time enrollment . 8 . Patients HIV positive ; patient active HCV HBV infection evidence plasma level HCV RNA HBV DNA , respectively . [ Note : Tests viral serology/infection perform prior transplant within 6 month dose may use satisfy criterion . ] 9 . HSCT recipient , qualify HSCT , receive another allogeneic HSCT within past 2 year . [ Note : Patients receive one autologous transplant addition qualify allogeneic HSCT exclude participation . ] 10 . Patients renal insufficiency evidence GFR &lt; 30 mL/min . [ Note : GFR calculate central laboratory use MDRD study formula . ] 11 . Patients current diagnosis hypotony , uveitis , retinitis intraocular pathology would predispose patient one condition . 12 . Patients hepatic dysfunction evidence ALT AST &gt; 5 x ULN direct bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN . [ Note : laboratory value , one retest allow per visit ( i.e. , screen predose ) central laboratory , local laboratory retest result may use discretion medical monitor . ] 13 . Patients follow active autoimmune disorder ; myasthenia gravis , Addison 's disease , Wegener 's granulomatosis , primary biliary cirrhosis , bullous pemphigoid , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , autoimmune hepatitis , multiple sclerosis , Goodpasture 's syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , lupus erythematosus , dermatomyositis , polymyositis , vasculitis . 14 . Patients active solid tumor malignancy exception basal cell carcinoma condition treatment ( example , lymphoma ) . 15 . Patients one episodes hyperglycemic coma diabetic ketoacidosis within past 6 month . 16 . Patients cardiovascular disease , opinion investigator , would interfere conduct study . 17 . Patients Grade 3 4 GVHD GI tract ; patient GI disease would , judgment investigator , preclude patient take absorb oral medication ( e.g . clinically active Crohn 's disease , ischemic colitis , moderate severe ulcerative colitis , condition expect require abdominal surgery course study participation ) . 18 . Any condition include abnormal laboratory value would judgment investigator put subject increase risk participate trial , interfere conduct trial .</criteria>
