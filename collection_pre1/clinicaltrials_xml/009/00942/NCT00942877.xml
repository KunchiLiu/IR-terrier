	<brief_summary>Background : - Alveolar soft part sarcoma type cancer develop tissue connect , support , surround organ body . It rely heavily new blood vessel grow spread body . There effective systemic treatment patient alveolar soft part sarcoma . - The drug AZD2171 ( cediranib ) experimental drug , yet approve Food Drug Administration . The drug block creation new blood vessel . The drug initial clinical trial , researcher interest determine whether cediranib effective inhibit tumor growth individual alveolar soft part sarcoma . Objectives : - To find whether AZD2171 work patient alveolar soft part sarcoma . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose alveolar soft part sarcoma . Design : - After initial screen visit , patient take AZD2171 mouth day , every day duration study . The treatment give 28-day cycle . - Patients keep study diary record dose take , missed dos , side effect . - Patients follow test procedure treatment period : clinic visit physical examination every 2 week , regular blood pressure monitoring , blood urine test , heart function test , imagine scan evaluate tumor size response treatment , possible tumor biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Cediranib ( AZD2171 ) Patients With Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Alveolar soft part sarcoma ( ASPS ) rare , highly vascular tumor accounting le 1 % soft tissue sarcoma . There effective systemic treatment patient metastatic ASPS . Little known regard relevant molecular marker potential therapeutic target . Cediranib ( AZD2171 ) , VEGF/KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor , recently demonstrate antitumor activity early phase clinical trial , include 7 adult 3 pediatric patient ASPS . Objectives : Adult patient : To determine response rate ( PR + CR ) AZD2171 adult patient ASPS . To compare gene expression profile pre-treatment post-treatment biopsy specimen . Pediatric patient : To determine pediatric patient ASPS experience least minimal response rate treat AZD2171 Eligibility : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma . Less 16 year old . BSA must great equal 1.04 m2 subject must able swallow tablet . Adequate organ function . Design : Adult patient treat AZD2171 30 mg mouth day 28 day ( 28-day cycle ) . Pediatric patient ( &lt; 16 year old ) treat 12 mg/m2/day day 28 day ( 28-day cycle ) . Blood pressure monitor weekly first 2 cycle every 2 week remainder study ( unless patient experience elevated blood pressure require drug therapy ) . CT scan perform baseline every 2 cycle restaging first 18 month ; 18 36 month , restaging CT scan perform every 3 4 cycle , respectively . The study conduct use optimal two-stage design pediatric adult patient . The portion adult rule unacceptably low 5 % clinical response rate ( PR+CR ) favor modestly high response rate 25 % . In pediatric patient , study rule unacceptably low 5 % overall clinical response rate ( CR + PR ) favor high response rate 35 % . Optional biopsy perform adult patient baseline 3-5 day treatment ( D3-D5 ) evaluate early drug effect . A third optional biopsy completion 4 week therapy ( C1D28 C2D7 ) may collect intention provide information disease response treatment . Depending result initial gene expression profile , time biopsy may adjust , without change total number biopsy per patient . In retrospective pilot study , CT scan 20 consecutive off-study patient rereviewed . RECIST image measurement compare volumetric density ( Total Volume Viable Tumor , TVVT ) CT measurement . The objective establish whether volumetric density/percent necrosis algorithm TVVT accurately assess extent disease response therapy standard RECIST criterion . The total accrual ceiling 73 participant ( 60 adult 13 pediatric patient ) .</detailed_description>
