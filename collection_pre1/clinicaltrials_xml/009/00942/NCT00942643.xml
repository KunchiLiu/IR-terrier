	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) may lead increased formation/accumulation advance glycation end ( AGEs ) , increase AGEs contribute part increase insulin resistance . The investigator hypothesize AGEs contribute vascular endothelial damage ultimately atherosclerosis OSA . The objective study : 1 . To explore relationship insulin resistance AGEs OSA 2 . To study relationship AGE vascular endothelial dysfunction OSA 3 . To study relationship AGE early atherosclerosis OSA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There grow evidence suggest pathophysiology OSA may lead atherosclerosis , independent confounding variable often present subject OSA . Many mechanism report contribute vasculopathy OSA , whether increase AGEs formation contribute significantly pathogenesis cardiovascular morbidity OSA remain determined . Advanced glycation product form non-enzymatic reaction reduce sugar glucose amino group protein , subsequent glycoxidation . AGEs form long-lived extracellular protein well short-lived molecule , cytoplasmic protein nuclear acid . AGEs cause number adverse cellular event demonstrate fatty streak atherosclerotic plaque . The formation tissue accumulation AGE show enhance hyperglycemia and/or increase oxidative stress . There increase evidence support important mechanism vascular end organ damage diabetes disease . In OSA , evidence support increase insulin resistance excessive oxidative stress , may predispose AGE formation . We preliminary data suggest increase level circulate AGE non-diabetic OSA subject . Since insulin resistance elevate blood glucose level , albeit diabetic threshold , may partially contribute increase AGE . Many potential mechanism atherosclerosis report , direct evidence atherosclerosis still lack . Subjects OSA also comorbidities may give rise atherosclerosis . With advancement non-invasive technique detection vascular endothelial damage early atherosclerosis , possible detect early vascular abnormality otherwise healthy OSA subject . This hypothesis underlie objectives explore relationship AGE markers endothelial dysfunction early atherosclerosis . Some early change , especially endothelial level , may reversible insult OSA remove . Thus longitudinal comparison OSA-treated OSA-untreated subject change would help clarify issue .</detailed_description>
