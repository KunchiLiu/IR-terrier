	<brief_title>A Study Effects Multiple Doses Dexlansoprazole , Lansoprazole , Omeprazole Esomeprazole Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Clopidogrel Healthy Participants .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize , open-label , single-center , multiple-dose , 2-period , crossover study assess effect multiple oral dos dexlansoprazole , lansoprazole , omeprazole esomeprazole steady-state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) clopidogrel healthy participant . Participants randomize equally eight regimen sequence group , 20 participant . Participants randomize Sequence Groups 1 2 , 3 4 , 5 6 7 8 call proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , respectively . Each sequence group consist 2 regimen . Sequence Groups 1 , 3 , 5 7 dosed Regimen A ( 75 mg clopidogrel ) Days 1-9 Period 1 cross one follow 4 regimens Days 1-9 Period 2 : Regimen B ( 75 mg clopidogrel + 30 mg lansoprazole ) , Regimen C ( 75 mg clopidogrel + 60 mg dexlansoprazole ) , Regimen D ( 75 mg clopidogrel + 80 mg [ 2x40 mg ] omeprazole ) , Regimen E ( 75 mg clopidogrel + 40 mg esomeprazole ) . Sequence Groups 2 , 4 , 6 8 begin either Regimen B , C , D E Period 1 cross Regimen A Period 2 . On Day 9 period , blood sample collect predose 24 hour postdose measure plasma concentration active metabolite clopidogrel . Platelet function assess daily prior dose clopidogrel Days 7-9 24-hours post Day 9 dose period . There washout interval 10 14 day last dose study drug Period 1 first dose study drug Period 2 . Study participant confine study center 10 consecutive night Period 1 , follow 10- 14-day washout interval confine additional 10 consecutive night Period 2 .</detailed_description>
