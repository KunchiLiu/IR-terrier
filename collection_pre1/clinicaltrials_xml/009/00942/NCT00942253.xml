	<brief_summary>Uremic etiology Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) associate poor quality life ( QoL ) compare RLS-free counterpart mainly due sleep deprivation factor . Exercise training hemodialysis ( HD ) patient RLS proven safe approach temporally ameliorate RLS symptom similarly use pharmacological treatment dopamine agonist . However know whether exercise anabolic stimulus dopamine agonist treatment could act synergistically improvement physical functioning muscle performance well amelioration augmentation symptom hemodialysis patient RLS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training Dialysis Patients With Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled study evaluate acute long term ( 6 month ) effect exercise training combination dopamine agonists quality life , muscle function , sleep quality metabolism patient restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) receive dialysis therapy . Objectives - Aims : 1 . To investigate whether single bout intradialytic exercise session could effect motor restlessness often see hemodialysis session patient RLS 2 . To investigate whether 24 week therapy dopamine agonist placebo effect sleep quality , functional capacity metabolic profile hemodialysis patient RLS 3 . To examine whether dopamine agonist placebo aerobic intradialytic exercise act synergistically improvement physical functioning muscle performance well could reduce sign augmentation hemodialysis patient RLS</detailed_description>
