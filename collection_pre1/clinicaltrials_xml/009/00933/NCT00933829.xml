	<brief_title>Comparison Cosmetic Outcomes Lacerations Repaired Using Absorbable Versus Non-absorbable Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though study show good outcome use absorbable suture skin closure clean surgical wound , ED base study still need conduct convince ED physician use absorbable suture close skin traumatic laceration acceptable traditional non-absorbable suture . Use absorbable suture confers several advantage non-absorbable suture . For one , patient need additional physician visit either office , often , emergency department . These visit add ED overcrowding , prolong length ED stay often reimburse see emergency department . Moreover , adult patient need miss work school child often miss school daycare suture remove . The potential avert another traumatic experience suture removal child restrain suture placement another advantage use absorbable suture non-absorbable suture .</detailed_description>
