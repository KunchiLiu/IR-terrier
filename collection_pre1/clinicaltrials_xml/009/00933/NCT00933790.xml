	<brief_summary>Acquired Rifampicin Resistance emerge important issue treatment HIV-TB patient . It major problem HIV-negative individual treat TB treat standard intermittent regimen . The study would generate data efficacy daily thrice weekly regimen ATT pulmonary TB patient HIV presence highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . Not many trial compare sputum conversion adverse drug reaction daily intermittent regimen ATT HIV positive patient . This study provide unique opportunity comparison daily intermittent therapy HIV patient pulmonary TB look multiple dimension HIV-TB treatment namely efficacy , drug resistance , toxicity , drug interaction immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome . The primary outcome study compare efficacy three anti-TB regimen ) reduce bacteriological failure b ) decrease emergence Acquired Rifampicin Resistance ( ARR ) . The secondary outcome include unfavourable response ( clinical failure , death , relapse ) whole , treatment emergent adverse drug reaction , pharmacokinetic level ATT incidence immune reconstitution syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Daily v Intermittent Regimen ATT HIV With Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV positive patient ( regardless ART status ) newly diagnose pulmonary TB attend TRC clinic Chennai , Madurai Vellore form study group . Those fulfill clinical inclusion criterion evaluate eligibility study sign screen consent form . Patients willing participate study undergo follow investigation namely , sputum examination , chest x-ray , liver renal function test . Hematological investigation include CBC , CD4 viral load , do periodically baseline , end intensive phase ATT , end TB treatment 6 month follow-up period 1 year . Patients get enrolled Chennai subcentres also evaluate immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome additional laboratory investigation . If patient satisfy inclusion criterion , house visit do social worker ascertain fact regard live condition domiciliary stability continue remain suitable , enrol study write , sign date informed study consent form . All eligible patient , enrol study , randomize receive one three regimen mention . Patients ART na√Øve refer National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) ART centre assessment eligibility procurement ART accord National guideline Common opportunistic infection could occur study period manage accord standard NACO guideline . Cotrimaxozole DS One tablet day give patient CD4 &lt; 250 along multivitamin , unless contraindicate . They discharge study 18th month sputum culture negative . Treatment regimens Dosing : - Regimen 1 . Daily - 2EHRZ7/4HR7 ( E 800 mg , H 300 mg , R 450/600 mg depend Weight &lt; 60 , 600 mg 60 kg , Z 1500 mg daily ) - Regimen 2 . Part Daily - 2EHRZ7/4HR3 ( E 800 mg , H 300 mg , R 450/600 mg depend Weight &lt; 60 , 600mg 60 kg , Z 1500 mg daily intensive phase follow H-600 mg , R-450/600 mg continuation phase thrice weekly ) - Regimen 3 . Intermittent - 2EHRZ3/4HR3 ( E 1200mg , H 600 mg , R 450/600 mg depend Weight &lt; 60 , 600 mg 60 kg , Z 1500 mg give thrice weekly ) Statistical design : Stratification randomization : Patients stratify base ) baseline CD4 ) less 150 ii ) 150 b ) sputum smear grading ) 0 ,1+ ii ) 2+ , 3+ randomize receive one three regimen mention , period 6 month , use restrict block scheme . The treatment assignment list generate start trial sequentially number seal opaque envelope , contain treatment assign prepared independently Chennai Madurai . Assignment patient regimens do study statistician link patient . Sample Size : Assuming daily part daily regimen 95 % resistance- free survival intermittent regimen 80 % resistance free survival treatment period , take account 20 % loss due death , default cause , power 80 % error 5 % , sample size calculate 140 per arm ( 420 case totally ) . Analysis plan Both efficacy analysis intent treat analysis undertaken . The primary approach intent treat analysis ( ITT ) accounting patient randomize study regimen consider drop out , death defaulter unfavourable outcome . However , Primary MDR -TB exclude unfavourable response ITT analysis despite allocation study regimen . Efficacy analysis include patient consume least 80 % schedule therapy ATT . Patients die within 15 day start ATT , NON-TB death assessment treatment consider efficacy analysis ATT . Patients die treatment culture grow M.Tb retrospectively include bacteriological failure take first event outcome . Kaplan Meier survival curve construct comparison do use Log-rank test . To identify important co-variates relation response toxicity , Cox-regression model use . Frailty model use account individual heterogeneity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year . HIV1/2 infect patient Pulmonary TB . This include sputum smear positive disease . Initially smear negative XpertMTB positive LPA positive take surrogate marker culture positivity ( e.g . miliary TB , Mediastinal adenitis Chest xray persistent abnormality antibiotic ) . BACTEC ( BectonDickinson ) phase , Final inclusion patient positive LJ culture Persistent Xray abnormality include allocation . However final inclusion ITT efficacy analysis depend positivity LJ culture . Living within 40 km radius near sub centre TRC willing attendance prescribed . Likely remain area least one half year start treatment . Willing house visit surprise check . Willing participate give inform consent go term condition trial . Patients know hypersensitivity rifampicin Pregnancy lactation initial presentation Major complication like HIV encephalopathy , renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg % absence dehydration ) jaundice ( serum bilirubin &gt; 2 mg % along SGOT /SGPT elevation &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal ) . Previous antituberculosis treatment 1 month . Prophylaxis ( nonrifampicin contain regimen ) consider prior antituberculosis treatment . Moribund , bedridden unconscious patient . Comorbid condition like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , cardiac failure , malignancy initial presentation . Major psychiatric illness . Patients second line ART , mainly protease inhibitor , initial presentation .</criteria>
