	<detailed_description>BACKROUND FOR THIS STUDY Anal cancer grow problem US . The incidence anal cancer increase among men ( 160 % ) woman ( 78 % ) 1973 2000 US [ 1 ] . In HIV-infected men incidence SCCA ( squamous cell cancer anus ) find range 49-92 per 100,000 patient year [ 2 ] . This prompt recommendation screen anal cancer population . HIV-infected woman also increase risk develop anal cancer . A study base data AIDS cancer registry find risk anal cancer among woman general population 1.2 % increase 3.9 % HIV-infected woman . In addition , HIV-infected woman eight time risk situ anal cancer compare number expect case [ 3 ] . SCCA appear many similarity cervical cancer . HPV detect 88 % anal cancer specimens HPV-16 find 73 % SCCA HPV-18 7 % [ 1 ] . In addition , SCCA develop transformation zone squamous epithelium anus columnar epithelium rectum , frequently associate dysplasia anus may precede squamous intraepithelial change also associate HPV . Cervical cytology , also know pap smear , detect cervical cancer precursor . Countries adopt cervical cancer screen program dramatic decrease morbidity mortality rate cervical cancer . Anal cytology may also use screen HPV associate anal lesion , among HIV-infected men sex men , abnormal cytology frequently associate dysplastic squamous cell lesion anus . Anal HPV infection ( high risk type ) find 53 Â¿ 95 % HIV-infected men . Abnormal anal cytology find 41-81 % HIV-infected men screen high-grade cytologic finding 2-25 % patient [ 2 ] . There study look anal cytology HIV-infected woman . The large study ( n=235 ) , Holly Palefsky [ 4 ] , find HIV positive woman 26 % prevalence anal cytologic abnormality ( mostly atypical squamous cell undetermined significance [ ASCUS ] low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [ LSIL ] ) . Forty-six woman abnormal cytology ( 60 ) underwent high resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) 14 find biopsy proven HSIL . Several risk factor anal cytologic abnormality woman suggest , positive anal HPV test , history anal intercourse , history cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion ( SIL ) , history vulvar wart , multifocal cervical SIL , history sexually transmitted infection , 10 sexual partner , history cervical , vulvar vaginal cancer , immunosuppression solid organ transplantation , HIV infection , long-term corticosteroid use cigarette smoking . It suggest HIV-infected woman , woman cervical cancer woman high-grade vulvar disease cancer screen anal cytologic abnormality . However , describe scanty literature describe prevalence incidence patient population large study conduct prior HAART era . We plan estimate prevalence 6-12 month incidence abnormal anal cytology histologic correlate HIV-infected woman see BMC . We hope information allow u make screen recommendation patient population .</detailed_description>
