	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Potential Interaction Between Telaprevir Methadone , Steady-State</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-sequence study evaluate potential interaction steady-state telaprevir steady-state pharmacokinetics methadone . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase ( within 21 day prior start supervise methadone intake Day -14 ) , treatment phase , follow-up phase . Participants stable methadone maintenance therapy enrol study methadone dose change start Day -14 . During treatment phase , telaprevir add 7 day ( Day 1 Day 7 ) participant ' current methadone therapy . The methadone dosage change Day -14 Day 7 . All intake methadone telaprevir supervise pharmacokinetic parameter measure study . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , alcohol breath test , cardiovascular safety , evaluation ( physical examination , pharmacodynamic assessment ) perform throughout study . The total duration study participant approximately 60 day .</detailed_description>
