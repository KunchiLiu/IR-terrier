	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety tolerability SRT2104 ( 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 g/day ) healthy male volunteer administer single dose daily 7 consecutive day . The purpose also characterize pharmacokinetic profile SRT2104 ( 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 g/day ) single dose multiple administration healthy male volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Safety Pharmacokinetics SRT2104 Normal Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , single center , clinical study SRT2104 administer orally . Randomized , placebo-controlled , single-blind , multiple-dose , dose-escalation inpatient/outpatient study assess safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SRT2104 healthy male volunteer . Forty-two ( 42 ) subject age 18-55 , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study . Seven cohorts six subject examine . Subjects within cohort randomize 4:2 receive SRT2104 one seven escalate dos ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G ) , likely 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 g/day placebo . Two subject dose Day 1 single dose period one subject receive active treatment one subject receive placebo . The remainder subject within cohort dose Day 2 single dose period three subject receive active treatment one subject receive placebo assume safety issue arise two subject dose Day 1 . Subjects remain fixed dose test material dosing day study . Each cohort subject dose sequentially approximately two week apart single dose period , return clinic approximately one week single dose administration receive 7 consecutive day dose multiple dose period . Each cohort subject multiple dose period dose sequentially , approximately , one week apart , allow comprehensive safety assessment prior initiation escalate dose subsequent cohort . In event suspect drug relate toxicity , determine principal investigator , sponsor , independent medical monitor , dose 0.03 g/day , subject 0.03 g/day cohort discontinue dosing , subsequent cohort receive 0.01 g/day seven consecutive day . Safety PK-related data review 0.01 g/day dose level , subsequent cohort enrol study . Subjects sign inform consent form screen visit . If eligible willing participate , subject enter study . Subjects fast least 10 hour overnight randomize receive SRT2104 placebo ( test material ) . Subjects require stay overnight study center two night single dose period study subsequently , duration seven-day multiple dose period ass safety gather require PK sample . Subjects ask return study center End Study safety assessment 1 week complete multiple dose period . Dose escalation dependent safety parameter ( physical examination finding , vital sign , ECG study , adverse event laboratory value ) PK data .</detailed_description>
