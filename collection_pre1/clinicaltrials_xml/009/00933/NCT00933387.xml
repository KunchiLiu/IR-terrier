	<brief_summary>Surgical resection follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy consider standard care locally advance OSCC ( LAOSCC ) . Although treatment could provide prompt local control , also associate high incidence distant failure . Systemic chemotherapy give either ( neoadjuvant ) ( adjuvant ) definitive local treatment extensively evaluate improve clinical outcome LAOSCC . Regimens taxane/cisplatin-based combination show improve treatment outcome patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) neoadjuvant setting . Recently , cetuximab ( Erbitux® ) , monoclonal antibody epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , also proven efficient agent advance and/or refractory HNSCC acceptable toxicity profile . In current study , shall evaluate feasibility , efficacy safety triplet bio-chemotherapy consist cetuximab , paclitaxel , cisplatin follow cetuximab-based concurrent bio-radiotherapy ( CBRT ) patient LAOSCC .</brief_summary>
