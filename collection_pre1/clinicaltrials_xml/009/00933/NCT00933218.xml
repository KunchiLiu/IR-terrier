	<detailed_description>Regular exercise lead improvement cardiovascular risk factor patient coronary heart disease , atherosclerosis metabolic disorder . Aerobic exercise anti-inflammatory effect . In contrast , exertional exercise marathon run cause acute pro-inflammatory impulse . This may lead myocardial injury , case preexist plaque , may result plaque rupture acute myocardial infarction . We aim define critical role inflammatory marker cardiovascular risc factor predictor increase risk myocardial endothelial dysfunction marathon runner . Diagnostic tool include measurement microvasculature , large vessel echocardiography . Inflammatory marker include high sensitive c-reactive protein ( CRP ) interleukins . All variation analyse basis consumption polyphenols find hop ( Humulus lupus L. ) beer .</detailed_description>
