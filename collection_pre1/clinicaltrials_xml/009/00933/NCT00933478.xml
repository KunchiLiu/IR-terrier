	<detailed_description>The Eustachian tube tube connect back nose ear . Its job keep pressure inside eardrum close pressure outside eardrum , eardrum vibrate properly . Usually tube closed , open briefly swallow . In condition call patulous eustachian tube , tube open time . This benign condition bothersome patients.1 The incidence patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction 0.3-6.6 % population . However , 15 % people condition bother enough seek medical attention . This condition common female male common adult children.1 Some common symptom patulous eustachian tube include roar tinnitus synchronous nasal respiration , audible respiratory sound , sensation plug ear fluctuating aural fullness . In case cause idiopathic . Some predisposing factor include weight loss , stress , anxiety , fatigue , pregnancy , temporomandibular joint syndrome . It also cause adhesion nasopharynx follow surgery adenoid . Sometimes associated medication diuretic oral contraceptive . Neuromuscular disorder cause atrophy multiple sclerosis , stroke motor neuron disease also postulate cause patulous eustachian tube.1 -2 The purpose trial learn condition help u learn eardrum might treat prevent vibrate sound noise come Eustachian tube . The first part study consist questionnaire help define symptom patulous eustachian tube , measure severe symptom . Currently treatments satisfactory patient . Common surgical therapy include injection various substance Eustachian tube open include paraffin , Teflon , gelfoam . Unfortunately , method either temporary lead serious complication include cerebral thrombosis death ( due inadvertent injection carotid artery ) . Other treatment focus cauterize Eustachian tube open either unsatisfactory caused damage trigeminal nerve . Myringotomy insertion ventilation tube help patient others find increase patient 's discomfort.3-4 We treat patient recently place putty like clay material eardrum , stop vibrate much patient 's voice , appear quite effective many patient . It also easily remove patient find helpful . However , really good idea exactly patient help , , much symptom help , well long treatment help . We find permanent hearing loss put putty eardrum . Subject Selection : There approximately twenty patient total . The absolute number depend number patient present patulous eustachian tube agree participate . All patient refer clinic otolaryngologist treatment particular problem . These patient select meet diagnostic criterion patulous eustachian tube . There exclusion criterion base age gender . Research Plan There randomization procedure , patient receive treatment condition . The investigator blind , one able perform treatment . The patient ask follow clinic per regular visit protocol . They usually book four-month follow appointment . If concern ask call book appointment earlier date . There laboratory testing . The amount clay use amount cover size dime . If concern adverse reaction treatment patient treatment stop . The clay steristrip remove . Analysis Data The data compile sent member statistic department Dalhousie University . All identify data remove . The pre-treatment value compare post treatment value see statistical significance exists . Confidentiality All data keep locked filing cabinet office 25 year , research staff access . The data analyze use various computer program , Gaitview 2002 , Microsoft Office program , SPSS statistical analysis . The data program available research staff via secure password . Names patient available research staff , numerical code use presentation publication data . The research team collect use information need judge safety usefulness study . This information use purpose study . Only Dr.Bance Dr.Bartlett access study data . Harms There risk trial . It generally well-tolerated procedure . The big risk failure procedure . It work everyone . The laser measurement eardrum without risk . This laser damage tissue . Putting steri-strip clay weight eardrum may carry 1 300 risk small puncture eardrum . Of , 95 % heal , may need repair . This , however , currently prefer first line treatment patulous Eustachian tube currently anyway . Benefits There financial incentive join trial . The major benefit potential resolution symptom patulous eustachian tube . The societal benefit easy safe treatment condition . Financial Compensation There financial compensation anyone involve trial . This include participant researcher .</detailed_description>
