	<brief_summary>Cachexia , condition severe malnutrition , negative nitrogen balance , muscle wasting , weight loss , anorexia , frequent affect 80 % patient advanced cancer disease cause high burden patient family . Nutritional , pharmacological , behavioural intervention cancer-related ACS associate symptom , despite importance cancer care , limited effect minority patient . New strategy require . Ghrelin , 28 amino acid peptide discover 1999 , predominantly secrete gastric endocrine cell endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue ( GHS ) receptor . When administer peripherally stimulate growth hormone secretion , food intake , trigger positive energy balance , produce weight gain central mechanism involve hypothalamic neuropeptides anti-inflammatory effect . A recently complete trial intravenous ghrelin advance cancer patient ACS report good tolerability safety single intravenous application 2 8μg/kg Ghrelin . Given fact ACS major burden patient suffer advanced cancer disease ghrelin major signal stimulate food intake , promote positive energy balance weight gain may anti-inflammatory effect remain determined whether administration ghrelin positive clinical effect cancer anorexia/ cachexia syndrome ACS . The next logical clinical development step proper dose-finding study twice daily subcutaneous administration proof-of-concept main outcome .</brief_summary>
