	<brief_title>VX-950-TiDP24-C133 - A Phase I Study Investigating Interaction Between Telaprevir Escitalopram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telaprevir investigate treatment chronic HCV infection , combination Peg-IFN ( pegylated interferon ) RBV ( ribavirin ) . Peg-IFN plus RBV currently accept methode treat HCV . Treatment Peg-IFN plus RBV HCV infection associate high rate depression . The result study provide dose recommendation coadministration Telaprevir ( TVR ) escitalopram HCV-infected patient . This Phase I , open-label ( participant investigator know name medication ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , crossover trial 16 healthy participant investigate pharmacokinetic interaction escitalopram TVR , steady state . Steady state term mean drug give long enough plasma concentration remain subsequent dose . The participant receive two treatment ( treatment A-B treatment B-A ) randomize order . In Treatment A , participant receive escitalopram 10 mg daily ( q.d . ) 7 day . In Treatment B , participant receive TVR 750 mg every 8 hour ( q8h ) 14 day , coadministration escitalopram 10 mg q.d . Day 8 Day 14 . There washout period ( period treatment take view medication eliminate body start new treatment ) least 14 day last intake study medication one session first intake study medication subsequent session . All study medication take food . Escitalopram take daily morning . During coadministration TVR escitalopram , first dose TVR take together escitalopram morning . Pharmacokinetic profile two compound measure blood sample take regular interval study safety tolerability assess study period follow-up . Safety tolerability evaluation record regular interval throughout trial period . Blood urine sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign ( blood pressure hart rate ) take screening , medication intake day 1 7 session day 14 treatment B 2 follow visit 5-7 30-32 day last dose drug last session . A physical examination perform screening , day first medication intake session 2 follow visit . Participants Treatment A receive oral escitalopram 10 mg daily 7 day Treatment B participant receive TVR 750 mg q8h Day 1 Day 14 , coadministration escitalopram 10 mg q.d . Day 8 Day 14 .</detailed_description>
