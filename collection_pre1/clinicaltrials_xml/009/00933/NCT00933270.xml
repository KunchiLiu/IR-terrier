	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , non-randomized , single arm , pivotal trial . The main objective study demonstrate safety effectiveness IDev SUPERA® Nitinol Stent System treat subject obstructive superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) disease . The primary endpoint primary patency SFA evaluate 12 month . The outcome compare performance goal base clinical trial percutaneous transvenous angioplasty ( PTA ) alone .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age great equal 18 year age legal consent . 2 . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior index procedure . 3 . Subject lifestyle limit claudication rest pain ( RutherfordBecker scale 24 ) rest anklebrachial index ( ABI ) less equal 0.9 . TBI ( toebrachial index ) perform unable ass ABI . TBI must less equal 0.7 . 4 . A single superficial femoral artery lesion great 60 % stenosis total occlusion . 5 . Stenotic lesion ( ) occlude length within vessel ( one long multiple serial lesion ) great equal 40 mm less equal 140 mm . Reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) great equal 4.0 mm less equal 6.0 mm visual assessment . 6 . All lesion locate distal point least 3 cm knee joint , define distal end femur knee joint , proximal point least 2 cm origin profunda artery . 7 . Patent infrapopliteal popliteal artery , i.e. , single vessel runoff well least one three vessel patent ( le 50 % stenosis ) ankle foot . 8 . The target lesion ( ) successfully cross guide wire dilate . 9 . Poor aortoiliac common femoral `` inflow '' ( i.e. , angiographically define great 50 % stenosis iliac common femoral artery ) would deem inadequate support femoropopliteal bypass graft must successfully treat prior treatment target lesion . This do prior treatment target lesion . Successful treatment define less 30 % stenosis either PTA stenting inflow lesion . After treatment inflow lesion , pressure gradient across target lesion obtain pressure gradient great equal 20 mmHg , subject include study . 10 . A subject bilateral obstructive SFA disease eligible enrollment study . If subject bilateral disease enrol , target limb select Investigator 's discretion , may use criterion lesion length , percent stenosis , and/or calcification content . The contralateral procedure do least 30 day index procedure ( stag ) ; however , contralateral treatment perform prior treatment target lesion , wait period least 14 day prior index procedure . 11 . The subject eligible standard surgical repair , necessary . 12 . A subject require coronary intervention perform least 7 day prior treatment target lesion . 13 . Subject must provide write informed consent . 14 . Subject must willing comply specify followup evaluation schedule . 1 . Thrombophlebitis deep venous thrombus , within previous 30 day . 2 . Receiving dialysis immunosuppressant therapy within previous 30 day . 3 . Thrombolysis target vessel within 72 hour prior index procedure , complete resolution thrombus achieve . 4 . Stroke within previous 90 day . 5 . Ipsilateral femoral aneurysm aneurysm SFA popliteal artery . 6 . Required stent placement via popliteal approach . 7 . Required stent placement across within 0.5 cm SFA/PFA bifurcation . 8 . Procedures predetermine require stentinstent placement obtain patency , instent restenosis . 9 . Significant vessel tortuosity parameter prohibit access lesion 90° tortuosity would prevent delivery stent device . 10 . Required stent placement within 1 cm previously deploy stent . 11 . Subject require coronary intervention , coronary intervention do less 7 day prior plan within 30 day treatment target lesion . 12 . Known allergy follow : aspirin three follow : clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) , ticlopidine ( Ticlid® ) , prasugrel ( Effient® ) ; heparin , nitinol ( nickel titanium ) , contrast agent , medically manage . 13 . Presence thrombus prior cross lesion . 14 . Known suspect active infection time procedure . 15 . Presence ipsilateral arterial artificial graft . 16 . Use cryoplasty , laser , atherectomy device time index procedure . 17 . Restenotic lesion previously treat atherectomy , laser cryoplasty within 3 month index procedure . 18 . Subject tissue loss , define RutherfordBecker classification category 5 6 . 19 . History neutropenia , coagulopathy , thrombocytopenia unexplained consider risk reoccurrence . 20 . Known bleed hypercoagulability disorder significant anemia ( Hb &lt; 8.0 ) correct . 21 . Subject follow laboratory value : 1. platelet count less 80,000/μL , 2. international normalize ratio ( INR ) great 1.5 , 3. serum creatinine level great 2.0 mg/dL . 22 . Subject require general anesthesia procedure . 23 . Subject pregnant plan become pregnant study . 24 . Subject comorbid illness may result life expectancy le 1 year . 25 . Subject participate investigational study new drug , biologic device time study screen . NOTE : Subjects participate long term followup phase previously investigational FDAapproved product exclude criterion .</criteria>
