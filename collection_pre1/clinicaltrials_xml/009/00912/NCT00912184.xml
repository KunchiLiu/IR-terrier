	<brief_title>Study Comparing High Cut-off Haemofiltration With Standard Haemofiltration Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During acute renal failure , small middle molecular-weight toxin accumulate . These molecule difficult remove standard haemofiltration . Accordingly , accumulate contribute morbidity long-term dialysis patient . Molecules cytokine show play central pathogenic role critical illness . In critically ill acute renal failure patient , accumulate serum likely contribute much morbidity ( fever , low blood pressure , myocardial dysfunction , renal failure etc . ) Therefore , removal cytokine appear desirable . Although different approach undertaken , limited success due complexity , limited efficacy uncertain clinical response [ 10-15 ] . It possible use different porous membrane , removal cytokine would much efficient clinical benefit blood purification would , therefore , great . A membrane kind available . It modification ( moderate increase pore size ) another standard material call polyamide , already use million people dialysis haemofiltration . The increase pore size new membrane direct effective removal middle molecular-weight toxin cytokine .</detailed_description>
