	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluation Efficacy Vaccination With Autologous Tumor Cells Plus Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) - - Adjuvant , Followed Systemic Low-dose-interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Administration , Patients With High Risk Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regimen : A vaccine comprise autologous melanoma cell plus GM-CSF in-adjuvant administer intradermally single dose . Subjects vaccinate least 6 week period ( week 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) , responder vaccinate every 4 week thereafter maximum 9 vaccination ( week 18 ) . Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 also administer daily 6 week follow second vaccination week 1 . Concurrent first three vaccination , patient also receive additional set 3 vaccination different site , response evaluate drain lymph node . This node harvest use lymphatic mapping sentinel node biopsy method .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose , cytologic histologic examination , stage III stage IV melanoma , sufficient resect tumor available vaccine preparation ( approximately 3 g tumor ) . Measurable tumor resection require . Patients 3 brain metastasis may include metastasis &lt; 2 cm diameter , asymptomatic , mass effect treat successfully surgical excision gamma knife radiation therapy . Patients large number brain metastasis resect treated resolve gamma knife radiation therapy may include status time study initiation meet criteria . For patient resect melanoma , surgical resection must perform within 6 month prior entry . All patient must : ECOG performance status 01 , , ability willingness give inform consent . Laboratory parameter follow : ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 , Platelets &gt; 100,000 Hgb &gt; 10 . Hepatic : AST ALT 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Bilirubin within ULN , Alkaline phosphatase 1.5 x ULN Renal : Creatinine within ULN Serology : HIV negative , Hepatitis C virusnegative . Patients candidate interferon , people decide take interferon , people fail interferon therapy ( patient progress interferon therapy experience major toxicity receive treatment ) . Patients currently receive cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy , receive therapy within precede 4 week . Patients currently receive investigational agent , receive investigational agent within precede 30 day . Patients know suspected allergy component vaccine . Patients receive follow medication study entry within 30 day exclude : Allergy desensitization injection Corticosteroids , administer parenterally orally . Topical corticosteroid acceptable , Any growth factor , Interferons , Interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) . Prior melanoma vaccination exclusion criterion give 8 week previously , record , data analysis take account . Other investigational drug investigational therapy also necessarily exclusion criterion , similarly record take account data analysis . Pregnancy possibility become pregnant vaccine administration . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urinary serum betaHCG ) prior administration first vaccine dose . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . This consistent existing standard practice vaccine chemotherapy protocol . Patients medical contraindication potential medical problem complying requirement protocol , opinion investigator . Patients classify accord New York Heart Association classification system Class II , III IV heart disease . Patients active connective tissue disease require medication , severe autoimmune disease . Patients actively hyperthyroid . Patients uncontrolled diabetes . Patients known allergy penicillin , streptomycin , amphotericin B .</criteria>
