	<brief_summary>The purpose single-blinded study healthy volunteer select Low-Concentration Capsaicin Topical Liquid ( LC-CTL ) serve control formulation clinical development Capsaicin Topical Liquid , NGX-1998 ( 10 % w/w ) . The goal identify low concentration formulation reduce ENFD healthy normal volunteer compare NGX-1998 ( 10 % w/w ) would still produce local capsaicin-related application site response ( e.g . erythema , heat sensation pain ) apply .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Tolerability Effects Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density Multiple Low-Concentrations NGX-1998 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single center , single-blind control study 36 healthy volunteer . Each subject dose four application site , 7 7 cm size , locate n distal proximal anterior medial thigh area . At two site , subject receive 15-minute treatment LC-CTL ( 1 % , 0.3 % , 0.1 % , 0.003 % 0.001 % w/w ) . At remain two site , subject receive 15-minute treatment NGX-1998 ( 10 % w/w ) control liquid ( CTL-V ( 0 % ) ) . The volume apply application site estimate 7 mcl per cm2 hence total volume approximately 300 mcl LC-CTL ( concentration ) , NGX-1998 ( 10 % w/w ) CTL-V ( 0 % ) apply site application sufficient evenly wet surface . The top bottom section application site pre-treated lidocaine 2.5 % / prilocaine 2.5 % topical anesthetic cream . These section also section skin punch biopsy take . The biopsy obtain section anticipate subsequent clinical trial patient use pre-treatment topical anesthetic . However , toop bottom section pre-treated topical anesthetic pre-treatment topical anesthetic cream interfere tolerability assessment . The pharmacodynamic effect nerve fiber density function evaluate immunohistochemical staining biopsied tissue treatment area . Skin punch biopsy four application site obtain evaluate ENFD 7 day post-application . Safety tolerability evaluate continuous monitoring adverse event ( AEs0 periodic assessment clinical laboratory parameter , vital sign , physical examination , dermal assessment , pain associate treatment .</detailed_description>
