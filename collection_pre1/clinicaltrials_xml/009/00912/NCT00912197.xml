	<brief_title>Effect Oligofructose Appetite Overweight Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appetite regulation play important part energy balance . Suppressing appetite manipulate diet safe way reduce energy intake body weight compare drug therapy obesity surgery . How various nutrient affect appetite fully understood . Non-digestible carbohydrate ( NDC ) may affect appetite differently due difference physio-chemical property . This project look two different NDC affect appetite energy intake overweight individual randomise , double-blinded , placebo control parallel study . The NDC investigation oligofructose cellulose , natural compound plant origin . The former broken ( ferment ) large bowel friendly bacteria produce various compound may affect appetite metabolism host . Volunteers consume one two NDC eight week ( include two week run-in period ) . Appetite study session , functional MRI ( fMRI ) MRI body fat scan conduct supplementation NDC ( supplementation case fMRI ) . Using fMRI effect NDC supplementation central appetite regulate centre investigate . Appetite questionnaires dietary record complete free-living condition baseline supplementation explore effect subjective appetite feeling energy intake , respectively . It hop project enhance understanding NDC affect appetite provide information fermentation NDC , gut hormone release , body composition , appetite regulation link .</detailed_description>
