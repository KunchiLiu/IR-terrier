	<brief_title>Analyzing Composition Lubrication Properties Synovial Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer serious arthritis may receive artificial joint replacement surgery . Comparing articulation articular cartilage , artificial joint undergo boundary lubrication thin layer synovial fluid molecule form artificial joint material . Therefore large wear rate observe artificial joint system . Researchers devote modify artificial joint material order reduce wear phenomenon . We first propose modification lubrication add effective lubricating molecule may help reduce wear artificial joint . However , still lack fundamentally understanding artificial joint lubrication mechanism synovial fluid . Hence , plan investigate boundary lubrication mechanism synovial molecule , albumin , globulin , hyaluronic acid , lipid first year . We would like obtain adsorption behavior single molecule well multiple molecule surface artificial joint material experiment . Molecular dynamic simulation also perform gain knowledge adsorption energy possible conformation change molecule . In second year , tribological heat mechanical effect synovial molecule study . The analysis platform establish perform composition property measurement synovial molecule . In third year , discuss effect synovial molecule transformation surround cell tissue . Their influence tribological biochemical behavior investigate .</detailed_description>
