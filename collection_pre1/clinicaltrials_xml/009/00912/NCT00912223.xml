	<brief_title>Blood Stem Cell Transplant With Low Dose Chemotherapy Relapsed Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( BMT CTN 0701 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular NHL , type blood cancer , second common type non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , approximately 15,000 new case diagnosed year United States . Chemotherapy common treatment option people NHL , first people achieve cancer remission initial chemotherapy . However , initial chemotherapy , people disease typically experience continuous pattern relapse result progressively short remission duration . A blood stem cell transplant another treatment option people follicular NHL . In blood stem cell transplant procedure , healthy blood stem cell take donor transplanted patient . The cell donate family member unrelated donor similar tissue type . Typically , people undergo blood stem cell transplant receive high dos chemotherapy transplant prepare body accept donor stem cell . In study , participant undergo type stem cell transplant call nonmyeloablative transplant , involve reduced intensity method transplantation require high dos chemotherapy . The purpose study examine effectiveness nonmyeloablative allogeneic blood stem cell transplant improve survival rate people relapse follicular NHL . This study enroll people relapse follicular NHL . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , lung function testing , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , bone marrow biopsy , questionnaires assess quality life . Participants admit hospital various day 2 week transplant , receive fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab , cancer medication , tacrolimus , medication help prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , attack donor cell body 's normal tissue . Participants undergo blood stem cell transplant . At various time 2 week transplant , participant receive rituximab methotrexate , another medication prevent GVHD . They also receive tacrolimus least 6 month help prevent GVHD . Participants remain hospital long necessary recover transplant . Follow-up study visit occur weekly Weeks 1 14 , Months 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 . At study visit , select baseline procedure repeat .</detailed_description>
