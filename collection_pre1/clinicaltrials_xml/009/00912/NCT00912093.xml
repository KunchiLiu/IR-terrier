	<brief_title>A Study Icatibant Patients With Acute Attacks Hereditary Angioedema ( FAST-3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III study consist two part : A controlled phase open label extension ( OLE ) phase . The controlled phase describe double blind part study intend evaluate efficacy safety icatibant compare placebo first treat cutaneous and/or abdominal attack . Patients moderate severe abdominal cutaneous attack randomize receive single , blind , subcutaneous injection icatibant ( 30 mg ) placebo . After protocol amendment , patient mild moderate laryngeal HAE attack also randomize receive single , blind subcutaneous injection icatibant ( 30 mg ) placebo order obtain blind , control efficacy safety data subset subject . Patients experience severe laryngeal attack ( post-amendment ) mild severe laryngeal attack ( pre-amendment ) receive open-label icatibant . After treatment first attack controlled phase , patient eligible enter OLE phase . In OLE phase , patient experience angioedema attack severe enough warrant treatment treat s.c. icatibant appropriate study discontinue product commercially available .</detailed_description>
