	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well everolimus without trastuzumab work treat patient breast cancer respond hormone therapy spread start place body . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving everolimus add trastuzumab time disease progression may effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial EVEROLIMUS ± Trastuzumab Hormone-Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common type invasive cancer woman , 1 million case almost 600,000 death occur worldwide annually . Breast cancer spread part body ( metastasize ) usually curable . Patients type metastatic breast cancer hormone receptor surface cancer cell usually treat drug tamoxifen , interfere function hormone receptor . However , average survival time patient remain around 36 month . In patient longer respond tamoxifen ( hormone-refractory breast cancer ) , cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , act protein call human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , may activity . In addition , study suggest drug everolimus , act pathway within cancer cell important growth tumor , may make cancer cell sensitive treatment trastuzumab . Thus , two drug may act together increase anti-cancer potential .</detailed_description>
