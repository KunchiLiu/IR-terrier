	<brief_summary>Autoregulation define ability vascular bed adapt vascular resistance change perfusion pressure . In eye , several study report retinal blood flow autoregulated wide range ocular perfusion pressure . In optic nerve head data available . Large scale study show reduced ocular perfusion pressure important risk factor prevalence , incidence progression primary open angle glaucoma . Former study investigate ocular blood flow autoregulation measure choroidal blood flow . For optic nerve head data available , although seem likely underlies similar autoregulatory mechanism . The primary goal present study gain insight phenomenon human . The present study aim investigate pressure/flow relationship measure optic nerve head autoregulation combine change intraocular pressure arterial pressure . Intraocular pressure increase use suction cup technique , mean arterial pressure increase squat . During whole procedure , optic nerve head blood flow measure continuously .</brief_summary>
