	<brief_summary>Ghrelin newly discover peptide secrete stomach . Its main role stimulate food intake recent study indicate also act cardiovascular system confer beneficial effect . The mechanism action unclear experimental study suggest ghrelin decrease sympathetic nervous system . Beside new evidence animal model ghrelin may also involve stress reaction ghrelin injection seem protect symptom stress . Given circulating level ghrelin reduce obesity , suggest effect ghrelin may differ lean obese subject . Ghrelin could represent attractive therapeutic strategy treatment cardiovascular disease . The aim study gain knowledge effect ghrelin sympathetic nervous system stress reactivity lean obese subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate effect intravenous administration ghrelin blood pressure , heart rate , muscle sympathetic nervous activity baroreflex control lean obese individual investigate whether ghrelin administration influence response stress . Both lean obese individual recruit receive intravenous administration ghrelin increase dos 1 hour . Their blood pressure , heart rate sympathetic activity ( small record electrode peroneal nerve ) record subject submit mental arithmetic stress towards end infusion . Blood sample take regular interval various metabolic test . These response compare submit saline infusion .</detailed_description>
