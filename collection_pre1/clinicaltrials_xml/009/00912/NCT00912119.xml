	<brief_summary>Craniofacial reconstruction surgery involve surgical approach craniofacial region repair cranial vault facial deformity . The surgery extensive , often require wide scalp dissection multiple osteotomy associate significant morbidity . Some severe commonly see problem associate rate extent blood loss . Efforts minimize surgical bleeding may translate reduce transfusion requirement lessen associated risk Epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) , inhibitor fibrinolysis , reduce transfusion requirement child undergo procedure cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , well old child undergo spinal surgery scoliosis ( 1-6 ) . Before controlled study assess efficacy EACA craniofacial surgical population do , appropriate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data need determine optimal dose strategy . PK data exist EACA child undergo operation CPB hypothermia . The aim study determine pharmacokinetics EACA infant child undergo craniofacial reconstruction procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Craniosynostosis condition premature fusion one suture bone skull . Craniosynostosis limit ability cranial vault expand accommodate rapidly grow brain infancy early childhood . Deformation skull shape result cranial vault expansion occur area skull abnormally fuse . Left uncorrected , craniosynostosis may adversely impact neurologic psychosocial development . In case , increase intracranial pressure may also result . Craniofacial ( CF ) reconstruction procedure treat craniosynostosis undertaken young child improve appearance , prevent functional disturbance , enhance psychosocial development . Optimal surgical result achieve procedure perform infancy . These procedure extensive , often require wide scalp dissection multiple osteotomy associate significant morbidity . Reported complication include massive blood loss , intraoperative cardiac arrest , transfusion reaction , venous air embolism , hypotension , coagulopathy , bradycardia , postoperative seizure , surgical site infection , facial swelling , unplanned postoperative mechanical ventilation ( 7-13 ) . Many severe commonly see problem associate rate extent blood loss . Intraoperatively , presence hyperfibrinolysis demonstrate child undergo CF reconstruction procedure ( 8,14 ) , although extent contribution bleed unclear . Epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) , another inhibitor fibrinolysis , attractive alternative . EACA synthetic lysine analog block lysine bind site plasminogen , result antifibrinolytic activity inhibition plasmin formation . We choose study EACA population .</detailed_description>
