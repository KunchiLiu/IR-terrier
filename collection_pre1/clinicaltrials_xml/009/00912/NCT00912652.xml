	<brief_title>Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Higher rate obesity , sedentary lifestyle , coronary heart disease observe rural non-rural area U.S. , yet treatment obesity rural population receive little attention . Efficacy trial , conduct academic health center , show lifestyle intervention produce sufficient weight reduction improve health , trial carry medically underserved community setting . Moreover , high intensity treatment use efficacy study represent barrier dissemination rural setting . The exist infrastructure United States Department Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service , 2900 office nationwide , may serve valuable resource bring lifestyle intervention rural area . Preliminary data rural obesity research program show promising finding lifestyle intervention deliver Extension office . The next logical step line research determine minimum intensity treatment require produce clinically meaningful , long-term weight reduction . We propose conduct single-blind , multi-site , randomize control trial obese adult ( N=542 ) evaluate effect LOW , MODERATE , HIGH dose lifestyle treatment two-year change body weight , compare education CONTROL condition . The LOW intensity condition reflect dose group treatment commonly use community setting , whereas HIGH dose corresponds intensity level employ efficacy trial . The MODERATE intensity intervention represent treatment dose preliminary data suggest may provide benefit comparable HIGH intensity intervention . Our principal hypothesis MODERATE HIGH intervention produce great weight reduction two year either LOW CONTROL condition . We also evaluate proportion participant condition , achieve clinically significant weight loss , examine change metabolic risk factor , dietary intake , physical activity , quality life . We calculate cost-effectiveness intervention , investigate potential mediator long-term change .</detailed_description>
