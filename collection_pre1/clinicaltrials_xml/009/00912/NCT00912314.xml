	<brief_summary>This study 2 part . Part 1 12-week observational study weekly Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation ( PTNS ) treatment woman overactive bladder . Part 2 randomize , control trial monthly maintenance PTNS therapy versus therapy subject successfully treat PTNS Part 1 . Part 1 : 12-week observational study weekly PTNS treatment . The primary aim Part 1 determine efficacy 12-week course PTNS treatment overactive bladder . Secondary aim determine change void frequency quality-of-life measure 12-week treatment . Part 2 : Randomized , control study monthly PTNS compare PTNS 12-week treatment The primary aim determine time-to-failure 12 week PTNS subject receive maintenance therapy compare , order ascertain need maintenance therapy 12 week PTNS . The investigator ' secondary aim compare long-term efficacy quality life impact patient receive maintenance PTNS compare determine efficacy rescue maintenance PTNS subject symptom recurrence maintenance therapy arm . Hypothesis : There difference time failure woman randomize monthly maintenance PTNS compare maintenance PTNS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Maintenance Therapy With Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study two part : observational study PTNS ( Part 1 ) randomize , control trial maintenance PTNS compare maintenance PTNS ( Part 2 ) . Part 1 : This observational study efficacy PTNS therapy woman bothersome OAB symptom fail anticholinergic therapy . Subjects offer standardized weekly regimen PTNS 12 week ask respond survey treatment . Pre- post- intervention assessment include 3-day diary ass voiding volume frequency , Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire , Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) , Patient Global Impression Severity ( PGI-S ) , Overactive Bladder Questionnaire ( OAB-q short form bother ) , Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form ( Urogenital Distress Inventory UDI 6 subset ) . Post-intervention assessment include , well Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI-I ) . Part 2 : After initial 12-week treatment , woman PGI-I le 4 , define patient perception bladder function well , much good , much well treatment treatment , randomize monthly PTNS PTNS . Part 2 study continue additional 42 week ( i.e . 52 week total part 1 2 ) . Subjects consider fail therapy PGI-I score great 3 . If currently receive PTNS maintenance therapy PGI-I score great 3 , withdrawn study transfer clinical care pursue treatment option . If maintenance arm PGI-I score great 3 , consider fail no-maintenance treatment arm may receive monthly PTNS treatment pursue treatment choose . Study questionnaire administer patient clinic visit . PGI-I questionnaire administer via mail ( follow phone call questionnaire receive within designate amount time ) . Sequence Events Part 1 : Initial urogynecology visit history physical ( part routine care ) . Identify patient interested PTNS Offer participation study , point subject visit transition routine care research visit . Complete questionnaire diary confirm inclusion criterion patient opt participate study . Weekly PTNS session nurse certify PTNS administration 12 week Telephone reminder complete 3-day prospective voiding diary prior MD visit . In-person clinic visit MD end 12-week treatment . Part 2 : Clinic visit MD end 12-week PTNS treatment , administration questionnaire . If PGI-I &lt; 4 , randomization monthly maintenance maintenance . Monthly RN visit PTNS assign receive maintenance PTNS . Monthly administration PGI-I mail one week prior schedule PTNS treatment ( would schedule randomize receive ) . If questionnaire return within one week , PGI-I administer phone . MD visit one year evaluation , administration questionnaire , end study interview . For patient already undergo PTNS therefore participate Part 1 study , sequence event follow : Clinic visit MD end 12-week PTNS treatment . Identify patient interested enrol study . Offer participation sign consent , point subject visit transition routine care clinic visit . Administration questionnaires void diary . If PGI-I &lt; 4 , randomization monthly maintenance maintenance . Monthly RN visit PTNS assign receive maintenance PTNS . Monthly administration PGI-I mail one week prior schedule PTNS treatment ( would schedule randomize receive ) . If questionnaire return within one week , PGI-I administer phone . MD visit one year evaluation , administration questionnaire , end study interview . PTNS Procedure : In study patient , PTNS perform per standard protocol train clinical R.N . follow . A 34-gauge needle insert approximately three fingerbreadth cephalad medial malleolus , posterior margin tibia anterior margin soleus muscle , approximately 3-4cm deep . A ground pad apply leg near arch foot , needle electrode connect Urgent PC stimulator ( Urgent PCÂ® , Uroplasty Inc. , MN , USA ) , adjustable pulse intensity 0-9 MA , fix pulse width 200 microsecond , frequency 20 Hz . The intensity increase large toe start curl toe start fan order assure correct placement , turn intensity patient tolerate . This treatment perform clinic nurse train administration , 30 minute weekly 12 week . If patient responds , randomize receive either 30-minute monthly maintenance treatment treatment . Outcome Instruments At baseline 12 week 52 week , 3-day voiding diary frequency volume chart Questionnaires regard quality life symptom improvement : A. OAB-q ( Overactive Bladder-q Short Form ) B. PFDI-SF ( Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form ) C. PFIQ-SF ( Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire Short Form ) D. PISQ-SF ( Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence/Sexual Function Questionnaire Short Form ) E. SF-12 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form F. PGI-I ( Patient Global Impression Improvement ) At week 12 one week maintenance PTNS ( maintenance PTNS would randomize receive ) , patient fill mail PGI-I . Sample size The primary outcome time failure measure PGI-I great 3 . Because data success rate without maintenance PTNS specific data regard time failure , use success rate power study . For 80 % power , confidence level 0.05 , estimate 80 % people initially respond PTNS ( determine PGI-I &lt; 4 ) continue improvement 1 year 12 week PTNS follow maintenance PTNS [ Cooperberg 2005 ] 20 % continue improvement one year 12 week PTNS [ Nuhoglu 2006 ] , need 7 subject randomized maintenance treatment 7 subject randomized maintenance treatment Part 2 . Based literature , expect least 60 % subject respond 12-week course PTNS , need 23 subject enrol Part 1 study . A sample size 23 subject start Part 1 provide 14 responder Part 2 . This offer 80 % power detect relative difference 50 % maintenance PTNS maintenance PTNS . To buffer potential drop-out rate year 30 % , plan enroll 32 subject total . Secondary outcome , include quality life , condition-specific quality life , diary measure compare observational study , well end year . We subcategorize subject whether intend remain anticholinergic medication , whether detrusor overactivity base urodynamic study ( do ) , whether receive PTNS year originally randomize receive maintenance PTNS . Data management At screening , subject assign sequential study number . These de-identified store lock file cabinet . Block randomization perform group 8 random number generator , odd number assign PTNS maintenance , even number assign maintenance PTNS . Assignments put sequentially administer envelope . Statistical Analysis The two group compare respect demographic baseline variable ( e.g . age , race , BMI , quality life status , prior treatment , current OAB medication ) use chi squared test . Analysis primary outcome comparison time failure measure PGI-I &gt; 3 group assign maintenance PTNS compare group assign maintenance via chi-squared analysis . A cox regression model may use analyze time failure maintenance PTNS compare maintenance PTNS . Other statistical qualitative analysis perform secondary outcome measure appropriate .</detailed_description>
