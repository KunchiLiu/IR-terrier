	<brief_summary>Background : - Normal fetal growth critical component healthy pregnancy long-term health offspring . Pivotal understanding dynamic human fetal growth define normal abnormal fetal growth development standard fetal growth . Objectives : - To establish standard normal fetal growth size gestational age U.S. population . - To create individualized standard fetal growth potential . - To improve accuracy fetal weight estimation . Eligibility : - Healthy , low-risk pregnant woman ( obese nonobese ) age 18 40 follow four self-identified race/ethnicity background : African American , Asian , Caucasian , Hispanic . Design : - Women recruit first trimester follow pregnancy . - Each woman receive six schedule ultrasound exam , include follow test : - Fetal biometry ( biological statistic ) visit . - Uterine artery fetal Doppler study select gestational week . - Women ask donate blood sample enrollment follow-up visit 16 22 week , 24 28 week , 34 37 week gestation . - After delivery , newborn carefully measure record birthweight , head circumference , body measurement . - Cord blood , plasma , placenta sample collect select newborn . - Post-study evaluation : - Women diagnose gestational diabetes pregnancy ask return follow-up visit 6 week delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal fetal growth critical component healthy pregnancy long-term health offspring . Pivotal understanding dynamic human fetal growth define normal abnormal fetal growth development standard fetal anthropometric parameter measure longitudinally throughout gestation , , turn , use develop interval velocity curve customize genetic physiological factor . We propose conduct multi-center prospective observational study ( 1 ) establish standard normal fetal growth ( velocity ) size gestational age U.S. population ; ( 2 ) create individualized standard fetal growth potential ; ( 3 ) improve accuracy fetal weight estimation . This study recruit 2,400 healthy , non-obese , low risk pregnant woman five clinical center . Approximately 600 woman come follow four self-identified racial ethnicity background : African American , Asian , Caucasian , Hispanic . Women recruit first trimester follow pregnancy . In addition , 600 obese woman also recruit . Each woman receive six schedule ultrasound exam , include fetal biometry visit uterine artery fetal Doppler study select gestational week . After delivery , neonatal anthropometric measure carefully take . Obstetric neonatal information extract medical chart . The National Standard Normal Fetal Growth important implication clinical practice research .</detailed_description>
