	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Within 14 day enrollment study , follow test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam . Within 7 day enrollment study , follow test procedure perform : -Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test test certain biomarkers ( check status disease ) . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take sunitinib malate capsule day ( mouth ) 4 week row follow 2 week study drug . These 6 week consider 1 cycle study treatment . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle ( every 6 week ) , follow test do take study drug : - You physical exam . - You ask feel side effect experience since last visit . - You blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test test certain biomarkers . For first 4 week treatment , blood pressure monitor . This may do home digital pressure device , may visit local doctor testing . About Day 21 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2- 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This may do local doctor 's office result fax study doctor . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , Day 1 Cycle 3 , Day 1 every 2 cycle ( Cycle 5 , Cycle 7 , ) , image scan check status disease . This could include CT MRI scan , ECG , chest x-ray . If doctor think necessary , may additional imaging scan time . On Day 1 every cycle ( Cycle 3 , Cycle 5 , ) , echocardiogram MUGA scan . Length Study : You may remain study long benefitting . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . However , disease get bad quickly Cycles 1 2 , take study time . Off-Study Visit : When take treatment study , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask feel change medical history since begin study . - You also ask side effect experience since last visit . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate approve FDA treatment adult kidney cancer . Its use patient germ cell tumor investigational . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
