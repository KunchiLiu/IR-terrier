	<brief_title>Booster Trial 07-0019 With A/Anhui/05 With Without MF59</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe disease human due avian influenza virus H5N1 subtype raise considerable concern regard potential emergence virus pandemic form . Planning control pandemic vital importance , cornerstone planning development effective vaccine H5N1 . This study design gather critical information safety , tolerability , immunogenicity booster vaccination influenza A/Anhui/05 without adjuvant MF59 subject previously prim clade 1 vaccine unprimed individual . Primary objective : evaluate booster vaccination different variant/clade A/Anhui/05 vaccine ass possible prime broad immune response 1 2 previous dos A/Vietnam/1203/04 ; compare 1-dose versus 2-dose priming A/Vietnam/1203/04 follow heterologous boost A/Anhui/05 ; assess safety MF59 adjuvanted A/Anhui/05 vaccine prim subject ; compare safety immunogenicity 1 2 dos A/Anhui/05 without MF59 adjuvant , saline placebo , Phase I dose response study naïve subject . Up 180 healthy adult subject age 18 49 ( Subjects previously enrol 07-0019 eligible 08-0013 even old 49 year age time enrollment 08-0013 . ) previously enrol Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) 07-0019 receive either 1 2 priming dos A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5 influenza vaccine enrol study . Additionally , approximately 555 healthy adult subject age 18 49 H5 vaccine naïve recruit receive 2 dos , 28 day apart , A/Anhui/05 vaccine without MF59 adjuvant placebo . Entry criterion newly enrol subject use DMID 07-0019 . Because extensive safety data collect similar H5 vaccine , subject screen clinical laboratory test . The booster Groups 8-9 randomize 1 2 possible dos , approximately 20 subject per Group ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) dose assignment : 3.75 microgram ( mcg ) MF59 , 3.75 mcg . Newly enrol , vaccine naïve subject Group 10 randomize 1 9 possible dosage without MF59 adjuvant , approximately 50 subject dosage assignment : 3.75 mcg MF59 , 3.75 mcg , 7.5 mcg MF59 , 7.5 mcg , 15.0 mcg MF59 , 15.0 mcg , 45.0 mcg MF59 , 45.0 mcg , 90 mcg , saline placebo 3 group 35 subject , receive different volume : one injection 0.5 mL , one injection 0.75 mL 2 injection 0.75 mL , comparison . Volunteers observe clinic least 20 minute vaccination , maintain Memory Aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) 8 day vaccination . Volunteers contact telephone 1 3 day vaccination ( approximately Day 2 post dose ) ass occurrence AEs/SAEs , return clinic 7 9 day vaccination AE/SAE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review Memory Aid . Volunteers Group 10 return clinic Day 28 review eligibility criterion receive Dose Number 2 A/Anhui/05 placebo . Volunteers group follow study schedule follow first vaccination . All subject continue follow 12 month last vaccination . It anticipate study enroll 735 subject 10-14 week . This</detailed_description>
