	<detailed_description>Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 Phase 2 , open-label , multicenter , efficacy safety study . It conduct use two-stage design intention determine initial efficacy Imprime PGG combination monoclonal antibody ( MAb ; cetuximab ) treatment KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Both stage conduct subject Stage IV CRC demonstrate KRAS gene mutation . All subject receive Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg standard dose cetuximab ; Imprime PGG cetuximab administer 6-week cycle . Subjects dose progression disease discontinuation study reason ; e.g. , safety , non-compliance . The initial cetuximab dose 400 mg/m2 Cycle 1/Day1 subsequent dos cetuximab 250 mg/m2 weekly . Imprime PGG dose weekly 4 mg/kg . Tumor measurement determination tumor response study perform accord RECIST . Approximately 56 subject enrol three participate center ( 17 Stage 1 39 Stage 2 ) . Final result determine combined Stage 1 Stage 2 data .</detailed_description>
