	<brief_summary>Patients require hemodialysis follow kidney failure need form dialysis vascular access order undergo dialysis procedure . Dialysis vascular access dysfunction enormous clinical problem . While best form vascular access arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) , primary problem early , aggressive cellular ingrowth lead poor maturation vessel , prevent use dialysis . Strategies prevent AVF failure need . Vitamin D hormone present human body important good bone formation immune function . There new information link vitamin D function vein artery , use creation arteriovenous fistula . Our body make vitamin D also get vitamin D diet . However , majority patient chronic kidney disease end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) low vitamin D level ( vitamin D deficiency ) . There several benefit correct low vitamin D level , however , know whether correct low vitamin D body lead good function vein artery use arteriovenous fistulae creation . The main goal pilot study examine role vitamin D supplementation AVF maturation useability dialysis . Study result use develop large study examine specific effect vitamin D supplementation vessel use AVF creation whether vitamin D promote AVF maturation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction major source morbidity cost among ESRD patient , account 25 % hospital stay , 50 % cost within first year initiate dialysis.The AVF provide high blood flow rate , few thrombotic infectious complication , low morbidity cost compare prosthetic graft central venous catheters.However , 50 % newly create AVF 's fail mature sufficiently chronic hemodialysis use . Clearly , determine factor predictive poor AVF maturation important patient care health policy perspectives worthy investigation . Vitamin D antiproliferative , antioxidant antiangiogenic property . The observed association vitamin D deficiency increase risk cardiovascular peripheral vascular disease may extend vasculature use creation AVF . As renal function worsens , patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) produce less vitamin D , due impair renal conversion 25-hydroxy- 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decline renal 1-alpha hydroxylase . As result , time dialysis initiation,78 % -90 % ESRD patient vitamin D deficient . Until recently , vitamin D deficiency among CKD ESRD patient treat hyperparathyroidism present , however , attention pay nutritional vitamin D deficiency give association range comorbid conditions.Furthermore , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D analogue compound associate improved survival CKD ESRD population . We believe observed benefit vitamin D may improve AVF maturation among population vitamin D deficiency highly prevalent .</detailed_description>
