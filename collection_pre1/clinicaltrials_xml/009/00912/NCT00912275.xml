	<brief_title>Lapatinib Combination With Oral Vinorelbine Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II clinical trial . In phase I part , primary objective To determine recommend dose combination lapatinib oral vinorelbine patient ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer . In phase II part , primary objective progression free survival combination lapatinib oral vinorelbine first line chemotherapy patient ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer . The secondary objective safety profile response rate Lapatinib , oral inhibitor EGFR HER2 , show effective treatment HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patient refractory herceptin , taxane , anthracycline treatment . In pre-clinical study , high synergism anti-Her2 treatment ( trastuzumab ) cytotoxics see platinum compound vinorelbine . The oral vinorelbine similar efficacy injection formulation demonstrate generally favorable tolerability . We interested lapatinib plus oral vinorelbine 1st line treatment Her2+ MBC , believe convenience treatment offer good response rate satisfactory life quality . For phase I part , plan use standard phase I 3-patient cohort ( `` 3 + 3 '' ) design . Up 18 patient may enrol . For phase II part , expect progression-free survival protocol treatment first line treatment ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer 6 month . With type 1 type 2 error 0.05 0.1 , respectively , design call 29 patient first stage . If 20 progression disease observe 6 month treatment , study terminate . Otherwise , additional 25 patient enter second stage . The treatment reject total 37 progression disease observe 54 patient 6 month treatment . With estimate dropout rate 10 % , 32 patient accrue first stage 28 second stage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast metastatic . 2 . Documented ErbB2 expression amplify disease invasive component primary metastatic lesion define : 3+ expression IHC ErbB2 gene amplification FISH/CISH ( &gt; 6 ErbB2 gene copy per nucleus , FISH ratio ( ErbB2 gene copy chromosome 17 signal ) &gt; 2.2 ; 3 . In phase II part , patient must chemona√Øve metastatic setting . In phase I part , patient may receive prior chemotherapy include vinorelbine metastatic setting . However , patient must inform well understand current standard treatment , suggest first line treatment erbB2 positive , visceral organ metastatic breast cancer combination chemotherapy herceptin . 4 . In phase II part , patient must expose anterbB2 targeted therapy treatment metastatic setting . Herceptin treatment neoadjuvant adjuvant setting permit provide least 12 month elapse since last dose herceptin therapy . In phase I part , patient may receive prior antierbB2 target treatment metastatic setting . 5 . Prior treatment endocrine therapy adjuvant metastatic setting permit provided therapy discontinue . 6 . Prior treatment radiation therapy palliative management metastatic disease permit provide least 2 week elapse since last fraction radiation therapy , disease progression document treatment related adverse event &lt; grade 1 time registration . 7 . Patients must evidence metastatic disease , measurable disease mandatory . To consider evaluable overall response rate ( complete partial response ) , patient must least one measurable lesion follow : Xray , physical exam &gt; = 20 mm Conventional CT scan , MRI &gt; = 20 mm Spiral CT scan &gt; = 10 mm 8 . Age &gt; 20 year . 9 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 10 . ECOG PS 02 . 11 . Patients must normal organ marrow function measure within 14 day prior randomization define : Hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 ; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL ; Platelets &gt; 75,000/uL ; Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X upper normal limit ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 X upper normal limit ; Creatinin &lt; = 1.5 X upper normal limit ; Patient must cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 50 % within institutional range normal demonstrate MUGA scan/echocardiogram within 4 week registration . 12 . CT MRI within 4 week prior randomization . 13 . Women childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 7 day prior registration . 14 . Patient consent must obtain . 1 . Pregnant lactating woman . 2 . Subjects current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) 3 . Prior therapy lapatinib . 4 . CNS metastases . 5 . Ongoing anticancer treatment . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , serious nonhealing wound/ulcer/bone fracture , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Patients GI tract disease result inability take oral medication , malabsorption syndrome , requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis ) .</criteria>
