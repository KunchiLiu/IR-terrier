	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) frequently underdiagnosed condition emerge increase medical problem important social financial implication worldwide . Its prevalence may reach 25 % middle-aged men 11 % woman . The important risk factor OSA obesity - every 10 % weight gain increase incidence disease 6 time . OSA usually occur middle age male characterize history snoring , daytime somnolence nocturnal choking gasping . The underlying cause transient cessation airflow due occlusion oropharyngeal tract . Episodes apnea consider important persist longer 10 second , case may last long 2 minute . The airway occlusion result recurrent hypoxia , hypercapnia , arousal sleep , compensatory hyperventilation lead secondary hypocapnia generation exaggerate negative intrathoracic pressure either directly indirectly harmful cardiovascular system several pathway like sympathetic activation , inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction . Recurrent episodes apnea/hypoxia may negatively affect function many organ , e.g . induce ( cyclical bradycardia apneic episode , follow tachycardia ensue ventilatory phase ) rise blood pressure . Moreover , OSA well establish risk factor systemic hypertension myocardial infarction stroke document blood pressure rise consistent fashion apneic episode . The mechanism responsible phenomenon complex direct effect apnea ( hypoxemia low intrathoracic pressure ) modify cardiopulmonary reflex . Undoubtedly , rapid increase arterial pressure occur end apneic episode mainly mediate surge sympathetic function arousal reaction . Hypertension emerge second , diabetes mellitus , frequent cause chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The rise arterial blood pressure endothelial damage due ischaemia apneic episode may contribute CKD . According recent finding OSA patient much frequently diagnose chronic kidney disease . The high frequency OSA patient renal function impairment could explain fact common comorbid condition CKD , namely atherosclerosis diabetes , also independently associate syndrome . The detailed pathogenesis strong relation OSA CKD investigate far . OSA patient characterize arterial stiffness , evaluate pulse-wave velocity ( PWV ) . PWV sensitive validate marker cardiovascular risk , include premature coronary artery disease , atherosclerosis , stroke cardiovascular mortality . The diagnosis acute kidney injury ( AKI ) routinely base change serum creatinine , measurement poor indicator acute deterioration kidney function . First , serum creatinine concentration might change 50 % kidney function already lose . Second , serum creatinine level vary widely age , sex , muscle mass , muscle metabolism , medication hydration status . Novel , specific sensitive biomarkers AKI neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , cystatin C , kidney injury molecule 1 ( KIM-1 ) , liver-type fatty acid-binding protein ( L-FABP ) , concentration urine serum rise significantly patient AKI correlate severity kidney injury . CKD devastate illness reach epidemic proportion worldwide . CKD characterize progressive decline kidney function associate excess morbidity mortality . The deterioration kidney function delay patient outcome favorably affect kidney disease recognize treat timely manner . In study would like prove apneic episode sleep cause repeat renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury , may lead repeat acute subclinical kidney injury ( AKI ) contribute development chronic kidney disease . The aim project study influence sleep apnea syndrome marker acute kidney injury , endothelial function , arterial stiffness central aortic pressure .</detailed_description>
