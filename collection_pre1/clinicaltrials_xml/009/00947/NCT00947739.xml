	<brief_summary>This phase I pharmacology study Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate Hydrate ( CZ48 ) Patients Solid Tumors Lymphoma . OBJECTIVES Primary : 1 . To describe dose limit toxicity adverse event profile Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate ( CZ48 ) administer orally every day . 2 . To determine Phase II recommend dose Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate ( CZ48 ) administer orally every day . Secondary : 3 . To perform pharmacokinetic study orally administer CZ48 plasma . 4 . To assess response RECIST criterion . 5 . To follow patient survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CZ48 analog topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin ( CPT ) . CPT alkaloid extract Chinese tree , Camptotheca acuminata . Only S isomer ( natural form ) biologically active . The intact E lactone ring , tend preserved acid environment , essential anti-tumor activity . Moreover , open lactone ring moiety tends promote toxicity [ 1-3 ] . In phase I II trial conduct 1970-1972 sodium salt CPT ( later show largely inactive ) toxicity include myelosuppression , diarrhea cystitis [ 2 , 3 ] . With observation 1984 mechanism action CPT topoisomerase I inhibition [ 1 ] , renew interest drug lead development variety analog , high potency parent drug . Some derivative water soluble CamptosarÂ® ( irinotecan , CPTÂ¬-11 ) HycamptinÂ® ( topotecan ) , currently approve use USA colon ovarian cancer , respectively . Studies show substitution C-9 C- 10 position enhance activity , may confer water solubility . In general , analogs water-soluble reduce anti-cancer activity preclinical model . The water-insoluble native camptothecin ( CPT ) cause diarrhea , prove dose limiting toxicity . Measurements demonstrate little close lactone ring CPT plasma subject receive compound [ 4 ] . This later explained demonstration CPT bind human albumin , action promotes open lactone ring [ 5 ] . Mouse albumin much less efficient activity , hence explain great antitumor activity observe mice model . In contrast CPT , CZ48 incubate vitro human plasma study vivo maintains substantial close lactone ring concentration plasma . It appear act pro-drug . The removal side chain endogenous esterases liberates active drug , CPT . Malignant cell high esterase content rapidly transform pro-drug active parent drug . Preclinical study suggest retention anti-cancer activity reduction toxicity , probably pro-drug systemic circulation little activity . Therefore , delivery high concentration close lactone ring CPT analog inside tumor cell potentiate anti-tumor activity . This study offer opportunity evaluate hypothesis . - OVERVIEW OF NONCLINICAL TESTING STRATEGY All nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetic , toxicology study describe herein conduct The CHRISTUS Stehlin Foundation Cancer Research . For study conduct accordance GLP regulation , location record inspection is/will include study report . For nonGLP study , study record retain file : The CHRISTUS Stehlin Foundation Cancer Research 1315 St. Joseph Parkway , Suite # 1818 Houston , TX 77002 Several experiment conduct examine primary pharmacodynamics ( i.e. , efficacy potency ) CZ48 various tumor line vitro vivo . In light intend Phase I patient population , CZ48 safety pharmacology package limit vitro vivo cardiovascular assessment . No secondary pharmacodynamic pharmacodynamic drug interaction study conduct CZ48 . Note : For GLP study purity CZ48 determine HPLC validate method 98.9 % . For study , drug formulate 0.5 % medium density carboxymethyl cellulose aqueous suspension ( CMC ) . For non-GLP study drug ( 98 % purity ) formulate suspension cottonseed oil ( except non-GLP study perform Covance also use CMC formulation ) . Studies characterize pharmacokinetics toxicokinetics CZ48 active metabolite camptothecin either single- repeat-dose administration conduct mice dog . The repeat-dose study toxicokinetic evaluation conduct part pivotal toxicology program use validated bioanalytical method . No extensive distribution study conduct CZ48 ; however , drug distribution tumor , liver kidney tissue tumor-bearing mouse evaluate . Several vitro vivo metabolism study conduct examine metabolic conversion CZ48 active moiety , camptothecin . Excretion study limit measurement CZ48 feces nude mouse follow single-dose administration . Pharmacokinetic drug interaction study conduct CZ48 . The CZ48 toxicology program consist exploratory ( nonGLP ) dose range-finding study mouse dog definitive ( GLP ) toxicity toxicokinetic study specie . Pivotal toxicology study conduct CZ48 employ intend clinical route schedule administration . Additionally , two study ( nonGLP ) conduct mouse assess general tolerability chronic high-dose CZ48 administration .</detailed_description>
