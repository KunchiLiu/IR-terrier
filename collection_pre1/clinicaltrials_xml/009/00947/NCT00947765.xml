	<brief_summary>Lateral epicondylitis , common problem encounter orthopaedic practice . Histopathological report show lateral epicondylitis inflammatory process degenerative condition term 'tendinosis ' . Beneficial effect local corticosteroid infiltration sound lack scientific rationale , since surgical specimen show lack inflammatory process . Recently injection `` autologous blood injection '' report effective intermediate long term outcomes .

	<brief_title>A Randomized Control Trial Evaluate Efficacy Autologous Blood Injection Versus Local Corticosteroid Injection Treatment Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Much controversy pathophysiology enough scientific evidence favour particular type treatment acute lateral epicondylitis . Currently degeneration origin extensor carpus radialis brevis ( ECRB ) , repeat micro trauma incomplete heal response accept cause lateral epicondylitis researcher . Histopathological report show lateral epicondylitis inflammatory process degenerative condition term 'tendinosis ' . There numerous treatment modality lateral epicondylitis conservative operative . Most conservative modality local corticosteroid injection focus suppress inflammatory process actually exist . A recent review article conclude short term outcome ( 6 week ) , statistically significant clinically relevant difference find pain global improvement corticosteroid injection compare placebo , local anaesthetic , conservative treatment . For intermediate ( 6 week 6 month ) long term outcome ( 6 month ) , statistically significant clinically relevant result favour corticosteroid injection find . So possible draw firm conclusion effectiveness corticosteroid injection . Recently injection autologous blood report effective intermediate long term outcomes treatment lateral epicondylitis . There significant decrease pain . It hypothesize mitogen platelet derive growth factor induce fibroblastic mitosis chemotactic polypeptide transform growth factor cause fibroblast migrate specialize find cause angiogenesis . A specific humoral mediator may promote heal cascade treatment tendinosis well . These growth factor trigger stem cell recruitment , increase local vascularity directly stimulate production collagen tendon sheath fibroblast . Autologous blood select medium injection ( 1 ) application minimally traumatic , ( 2 ) reduce risk immune-mediated rejection , devoid potential complication hypoglycemia , skin atrophy , tendon tear associate corticosteroid injection ( 3 ) simple acquire prepare , easy carry outpatient procedure ( 4 ) inexpensive . There study do evaluate injection autologous blood lateral epicondylitis treatment modality . Hence evaluate compare corticosteroid injection commonly practice conservative treatment modality .</detailed_description>
