	<detailed_description>The cochlear implant appear today one best technique lead congenital deaf child speak . However result term accurate access language remain partial . These result usually due child factor ( social , educational handicap one ) , one action limit effect . Besides , external factor one rely : `` treatment `` . For instance , early cochlear implant child main stream well access speak properly later . Another essential point tackle early re-education training remain essential treatment . Yet , gap fill theory main assistance auditory education practice . Researches auditory cognitive science make distinction different operation treatment range identification sound source discrimination specific acoustic parameter analysis auditory scene memorization source . ( Mc Adams Bigand , 1994 ) .Each operation implies specific treatment . Yet , operation systematically follow re-education treatment among deaf child even one know positive impact linguistic skill . They train large range non linguistic stimulus specific stimulus belong fundamental auditory cognition , development lead benefit treatment auditory stimulus . Music part parcel chosen stimulus , many critic prove music source transfer effect visual spatial skill instance ( Giomi-Costa , 2003 ) A synthesis research source call `` method program auditory skill `` whose purpose develop complete auditory skill ability . This complete teaching programme integrate playful context child allow control action , gesture game well sound atmosphere . This teach programme control computer large number different sound link playful sphere . The main objective survey evaluate efficiency auditory teach programme ( MPAA ) 4 test skill ( identification , discrimination , analysis sound scenes memory ) among pre-speaking cochlear implant congenital deaf child age 4 10 . This study take place CHU de La Timone Marseilles ENT child department heart cooperation Dr Emmanuel Bigand team Dijon ( LEAD CNRS , UMR 5022 Ã  Dijon ) . The cochlear implant child department Marseilles gather group 70 implanted child age 4 10 adequacy parameter method evaluate . Two group 21 cochlear implant child include study . This study divide two phase separate 3 session evaluation test . The first session T1 occur two group ( experimentation G1 control G2 ) , first train session start group G1 . The second session T2 occur two group , first train session start group G2 . The third session T3 occur 2 group end experiment . By train 4 perceptible operation different auditory stimulation ( speech , music , sound electro-acoustic sound ) , look good performance train skill well teach transfer linguistic ability ( phonetics discrimination speech ) .</detailed_description>
