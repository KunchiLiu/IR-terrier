	<brief_summary>The Simple Acute Coronary Syndrome ( SACS ) Score develop Risk Stratification Tool Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) . It tool rate patient 's : SYMPTOMS , EKG FINDINGS , RISK FACTOR PROFILE , CARDIAC MARKERS scale zero six . The purpose study validate SACS Scoring tool establish correlation score 's numerical value degree obstructive cardiovascular disease visualize cardiac catheterization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depending whose publish research reference , estimate 68,000 136,000 people ACS misdiagnosed discharge annually nation 's emergency department . The emotional loss grieve family member incalculable . The negative financial impact family lose primary income provider loss incur health care provider legal expense also significant . Misdiagnosis ACS due , part , : - Patients present ATYPICAL symptom ACS - Problems SENSITIVITY SPECIFICITY 12 Lead EKG - Inconsistent integration Patients ' Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) Risk Factor Profile clinical decision make process . One solution improve ACS diagnostic accuracy clinician utilize ACS Risk Stratification Tool proven highly sensitive specific respect identifying patient significant underlying CAD . While screen approximately 50 patient case study inclusion 12 Lead EKG education curriculum , multiple incident note patient 's Modified TIMI ACS Risk Score accurately correlate patient 's degree cardiovascular disease . In several case , disparity Modified TIMI Risk Score patient 's disease status great clinician consider score clinical decision making process , patient would discharge `` clean bill health , '' actually severe underlying CAD ; scenario would `` set stage '' adverse outcome . In search reliable ACS Risk Stratification Tool , none find deem consistently reliable enough use adjunct clinical decision making . This could due , part , fact tool currently available ( TIMI , GRACE , PURSUIT ) , primarily design prognostic indicator mortality patient diagnose ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) pharmaceutical study - tool assess probability ACS exist patient present Emergency Department . This prompt development SACS Score . In approximately 50 case informally studied date , SACS score tool produce score consistent predictive presence obstructive CAD Modified TIMI Risk Score . Our formal study consist least 200 patient , include two group . GROUP 1 consist Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) patient ( STEMI / NSTEMI ) treat St. Joseph 's Hospital , begin January , 2009 continue target number 200 patient obtain . In order delay urgent cardiac catheterization treatment , patient study retrospectively ( post cardiac catheterization intervention ) . GROUP 2 consist randomly select patient clinically stable time cardiac catheterization . These patient study prospectively . To maintain integrity study , patient select , write consent obtain , prior cardiac catheterization . Data collect case study ( group ) include demographic specific information patient 's SYMPTOMS , EKG FINDINGS , RISK FACTOR PROFILE CARDIAC LABS . NOTE : ADDED JULY , 2010 : To assure accuracy respect comparison SACS score ACS Risk Stratification scoring tool , include patient study whose medical record reflect accurate risk factor history assessment consistent TIMI risk factor assessment guideline . For example , record patient `` Family History Positive Coronary Artery Disease , '' state specifically WHICH family member ( ) , and/or state SPECIFIC CARDIAC DIAGNOSIS ( `` Acute Myocardial Infarction '' ) , and/or include AGE family member time diagnosis , WILL NOT include patient study . A complete list TIMI Risk Factor Assessment Guidelines TIMI guideline find www.TIMI.org , POST CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION data classify category base cath lab finding : 1 . No visible CAD present 2 . Mild-to-moderate plaquing without obstructive CAD . No catheter-based surgical intervention perform . Number lesion , location ( ) , percentage ( ) arterial obstruction specify . 3 . Significant obstructive CAD present . Number lesion , location ( ) , percentage ( ) arterial obstruction intervention ( ) perform specify . 4 . Acute total occlusion coronary artery require emergency intervention . Location lesion intervention ( ) perform specify . Regression Analysis 126 data point collect patient use establish relationship score value degree obstructive CAD present . We believe scientifically validate , SACS Score become useful tool aid medical professional reduce incidence patient misdiagnosed respect ACS .</detailed_description>
