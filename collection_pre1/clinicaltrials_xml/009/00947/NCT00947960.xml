	<brief_title>Triheptanoin Treatment Trial Patients With Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult polyglucosan disease progressive neurogenetic disorder characterize neurogenic bladder , progressive difficulty walking , sensory abnormality low extremity typically present 4th 5th decade life . The pathogenesis disease include accumulation intracellular polyglucosan body ( amylopectin-like polysaccharide ) peripheral nerve well central nervous system cell often associate brancher enzyme deficiency cause improper glycogen formation . It hypothesize decreased glycogen degradation lead energy deficit nervous system cell . Therefore , anaplerotic therapy may supply needed substrate citric acid cycle correct energy deficit . This intervention may slow , halt reverse progression disease , effective treatment . The trial involve 18 subject ingest diet supplement triheptanoin , 7 carbon triglyceride placebo vegetable oil dose 1-2 g/kg/24 hour randomize crossover control double blind study . The study last one year patient receive triheptanoin 6 mo placebo oil 6 mo . Safety monitoring include urine organic acid acyl carnitine profile .</detailed_description>
