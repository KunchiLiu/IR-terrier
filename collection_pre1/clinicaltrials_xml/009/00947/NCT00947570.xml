	<brief_title>Neural Functioning Underlying Anxiety Its Treatment ( The INSULA Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder characterize excessive irrational fear common situation impair normal functioning . Neuroimaging allow researcher examine brain functioning people present task provoke model anxiety . Neuroimaging research suggest anxiety moderate neural circuit involve three part brain : amygdala , insula , prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . Increased activation amygdala insula associate high anxiety , although activation PFC think reduce anxiety . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) type psychotherapy strong evidence effectively treat panic disorder ( PD ) generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , work half time . This study use neuroimaging examine CBT affect brain function people PD GAD . The long-term goal research develop neuroimaging diagnostic tool , use neuroimaging predict treatment response , understand change brain functioning related successful treatment . Participation study last approximately 3 month . Four group participant recruit : healthy control people PD , GAD , social phobia ( SP ) . All participant undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning—a measure brain functioning—at first visit . During fMRI scan , participant ask perform computerized task involve respond image . This visit healthy control people SP complete ; inclusion study establishes comparison point brain scan participant . People PD GAD ask complete 10 session CBT 10- 14-week period . After 3 month , participant undergo fMRI scanning . At 3 6 month completion CBT , participant ask complete follow-up questionnaire anxiety .</detailed_description>
