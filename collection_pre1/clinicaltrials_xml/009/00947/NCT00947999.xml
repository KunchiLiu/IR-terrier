	<detailed_description>Research staff record brain activity subject use electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , device measure electrical activity brain electrode put scalp . There risk electrical shock . Research staff put cap subject 's head electrodes measure brain activity . In addition electrode cap , two electrode clip put ear . EEG activity collect 20 minute : subject eye open ten minute , eye close ten minute . Before assessment , subject ask much pain currently . Once 20-minute assessment end , research staff member ask subject much pain currently , much pain EEG assessment .
