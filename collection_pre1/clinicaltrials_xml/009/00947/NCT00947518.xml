	<brief_title>Safety Skin Cleansing With Chlorhexidine Preterm Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections lead cause death neonate admit hospital - study develop country suggest 25-71 % death occur neonatal intensive care unit secondary infections.Such high infection-related mortality mandate urgent implementation simple effective measure prevent occurrence infection unit . The majority neonatal infection occur first two week life , epidermal barrier immature functionally compromise . Topical application antiseptic skin matures could theoretically prevent skin colonization reduce incidence systemic infection neonate . Chlorhexidine , broad-spectrum antiseptic use frequently umbilical cord care neonate , evaluate topical application skin . Hospital-based study , involve predominantly term infant , show reduction skin flora8 reduction incidence sepsis follow topical chlorhexidine application . In community-based study Nepal , single skin cleanse 0.25 % chlorhexidine result reduction mortality among low birth weight infant ; though mechanism impact could determine , presumably due increase susceptibility transcutaneous sepsis low birth weight group . Since risk infection neonate inversely related gestation , essential evaluate effect mechanism intervention preterm neonate . These infant , however , prone develop skin reaction follow use topical antiseptic . Preterm infant also prone develop hypothermia follow bathing/cleansing antiseptic solution ( ) . Since study evaluate effect topical application chlorhexidine preterm infant admit health care facility , conduct present study examine single skin cleanse 0.25 % chlorhexidine immediately birth affect skin condition , temperature , colonization hospitalize preterm low birth weight infant .</detailed_description>
