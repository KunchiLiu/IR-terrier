	<brief_summary>Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) group 24 zinc contain enzyme man . These enzyme originally describe cleave extracellular matrix ( ECM ) substrates predominant role ECM homeostasis , clear much wide functionality . An imbalance MMP activity inhibitor ( tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases , TIMPs ) consider play critical role synthesis degradation extracellular matrix airway architecture result fix airflow obstruction asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) investigator identify difference level steady state mRNA MMP-9 , MMP-14 MMP-2 2 patient asthma compare 4 healthy control use method . However investigator require refinement process order optimise RNA quality evaluate effect montelukast across entire family MMPs inhibitor ( TIMPs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following measurement perform screening : - Informed consent - Clinical examination - Spirometry - Induced sputum The follow perform 8 week study medication : - Clinical examination - Spirometry - Induced sputum - Diary Card Spirometry : This perform Microlab spirometer ( Micro Medical Ltd , Rochester , Kent , UK ) . The procedure accord American Thoracic Society specification ( 13 ) . Diary Card Data : Patients record symptom daily basis morning accord `` cough '' , `` breathlessness '' `` wheeze '' 4 point scale 0=no symptom 3=maximal symptom . A total symptom score calculate 12 . Patients also measure peak expiratory flow daily basis morning record high three measurement . They record take study medication . Sputum Induction &amp; Examination : Sputum obtain hypertonic saline method describe Pizzichini et al ( 14 ) inhale increase concentration saline ( 3 , 4 5 % ) 7 minute , mouthpiece . After period inhalation , FEV1 measure safety . Subjects ask cough sputum sterile container . Total cell count leukocyte obtain modified Neubauer haemocytometer . The cell viability determine trypan blue exclusion method . Four hundred non squamous cell count Wright-stained slide result express percentage absolute number total non squamous count . Measurement MMP-9 , 12 TIMP-1 TGFb perform sputum supernatant . Profile mRNA MMP TIMPs : Total RNA extract cellular content induce sputum plug use combination Trizol extraction Qiagen RNeasy spin column similar way previously described12 . Quantitative RT-PCR , use previously develop primer probe , use determine relative quantity mRNA MMPs TIMPs described12 . We remain centre world routinely profile entire MMP TIMP gene family human sample . This give encompass view involvement enzymes inhibitor disease process also shed light potential new biomarkers . The possibility expand gene profile without need additional sputum collection also add value research . This might include proteinase family roles ECM breakdown inflammation .</detailed_description>
