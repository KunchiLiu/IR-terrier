Upon DSMB review first ten subject complete switch part study , DSMB approval , additional 20 subject enrol safety extension part study . HPN-100 triglyceride similar mechanism action NaPBA . It liquid minimal taste odor . Three teaspoon HPN-100 ( ~17.4mL ) deliver equivalent amount PBA 40 tablet NaPBA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This fixed-sequence , open-label , switch study HPN-100 long-term ( 12 month ) safety extension part design assess safety HPN-100 pediatric subject prospectively assess ability HPN-100 control blood ammonia compare NaPBA . For subject participate switch , NaPBA dose three time daily ( TID ) meal first week PBA mole-equivalent dose HPN-100 second week . If safety concern regard single-step transition NaPBA HPN-100 , investigator 's discretion , transition could occur 2 step second week , subject might receive 50 % PBA equivalent dose NaPBA 50 % HPN-100 receive 100 % PBA equivalent dose HPN-100 third week . Serial blood sample collect PK blood ammonia assessment drug reach steady state , achieve approximately 4 day initiation 100 % NaPBA HPN-100 treatment . The subject complete switch part study , 20 additional subject , offer opportunity continue study enter safety extension part study continue receive open-label HPN-100 12 month . Subjects prematurely terminate study switch-over period enrollment safety assessment , include safety lab single blood sample drawn measurement phenylbutyrate ( PBA ) , active metabolite phenylacetate ( PAA ) , terminal metabolite phenylacetylglutamine ( PAGN ) . Subjects enrol safety extension period study , either directly follow switch , prematurely terminate study prior complete extension period Month 12 procedure perform , minimum , safety assessment include safety lab ammonia drawn . The time day blood sample drawn record well time since last dose medication take . Subjects follow stable diet throughout study , prescribe investigator , dietary compliance record study visit switch safety extension part study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject 617 year old . Signed informed consent subject 's legally acceptable representative assent subject , applicable . Diagnosis urea cycle disorder ( enzyme transporter deficiency ) confirm via enzymatic , biochemical , genetic testing . On stable dose NaPBA diagnosis UCD least 1 week prior Day 1 visit . *Subjects stable dose NaPBA initial screen visit may convert stable dose NaPBA screening period enrol long stable dose NaPBA least 1 week prior Day 1 Able perform comply study activity , include blood draw urine collection . Negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential . All female childbearing age sexually active male must agree use acceptable method contraception throughout study . Screening ammonia level ≥100 μmol/L sign symptom indicative hyperammonemia ; subject may rescreened ammonia control , discretion investigator . History 4 hyperammonemic event define Section 3.5.1 precede 12 month . Use investigational drug within 30 day Day 1 . Active infection ( viral bacterial ) condition may increase ammonia level . Any clinical laboratory abnormality Grade 3 great severity accord CTCAE v3.0 , except Grade 3 elevation liver enzymes , define level 520 time ULN ALT/SGPT , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST/SGOT ) , gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) clinically stable subject . Any clinical laboratory abnormality medical condition , discretion investigator , may put subject increase risk participate study . Use medication know significantly affect renal clearance ( e.g. , probenecid ) increase protein catabolism ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) , medication know increase ammonia level ( e.g. , valproate ) , within 24 hour prior Day 1 throughout study . History QTc interval prolongation QTc interval &gt; 450 msec screen baseline . Known hypersensitivity PAA PBA . Liver transplant , include hepatocellular transplant . Currently treat sodium benzoate Carbaglu® ( carglumic acid ) . At discretion investigator , subject sodium benzoate otherwise eligible participate may switch 100 % NaPBA 30 day screen period part study , least 7 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) .
