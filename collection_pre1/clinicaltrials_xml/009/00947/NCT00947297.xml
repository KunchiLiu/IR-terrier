	<brief_title>Study Safety HPN ( Hyperion ) -100 Long-Term Treatment Urea Cycle Disorders ( Treat UCD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one year long-term safety study HPN-100 UCD subject . Subjects assess regularly safety control venous ammonia . Hyperammonemic event characterize respect contribute factor , intercurrent illness , diet , noncompliance medication . Forty subject diagnosis UCD complete Study HPN-100-006 enrol . Twenty additional UCD subject ≥ 6 year age enrol . These subject include qualify HPN-100-006 [ e.g. , subject age 6-17 ; subject UCD subtypes adult subject take sodium phenylbutyrate ( NaPBA ) past 6 month , etc. ] . For adult subject receive NaPBA past 6 month , subject must , judgment investigator , anticipated benefit addition nitrogen-scavenging agent current treatment . See inclusion criterion examples clinical evidence potential benefit . Monthly assessment include safety laboratory test , amino acid panel , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring , venous ammonia , blood urine metabolite . Adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication record ongoing basis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject complete HPN100006 : *Additionally , approximately 20 UCD subject ≥ 6 year age may enrol participate HPN100006 . These subject may include qualify HPN100006 ( e.g. , subject age 617 year , subject UCD subtypes , adult subject take sodium phenylbutyrate ( NaPBA ) past 6 month , etc. ) . For adult subject receive NaPBA past 6 month , subject must , judgment investigator , anticipated benefit addition nitrogenscavenging agent current treatment . Clinical evidence potential benefit introduction ammoniascavenging agent might include recent history ( past year ) clinically overt hyperammonemia accompany venous ammonia ≥ 100 μmol/L , recent history ( within past year ) protein intolerance , history abnormally high venous ammonia level accompany symptom ( e.g. , headache ) might reasonably attribute hyperammonemia . Signed informed consent subject and/or subject 's legally acceptable representative . Diagnosis urea cycle disorder ( enzyme transporter deficiency ) confirm via enzymatic , biochemical , genetic testing . Able perform comply study activity , include blood draw . Negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential . All female childbearing potential sexually active male must agree use acceptable method contraception throughout study . Screening venous ammonia level ≥ 100 μmol/L sign symptom indicative hyperammonemia ; subject may rescreened venous ammonia control , discretion investigator . History 4 hyperammonemic event define Section 3.5.1 precede 12 month . Active infection ( viral bacterial ) condition may increase venous ammonia level . Any clinical laboratory abnormality medical condition , discretion investigator , may put subject increase risk participate study . Use medication know significantly affect renal clearance ( e.g. , probenecid ) increase protein catabolism ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) , medication know increase venous ammonia level ( e.g. , valproate ) , within 24 hour prior Day 1 throughout study . History QTc ( QT interval correct ) prolongation , QTc interval ≥ 450 msec increase ≥ 60 msec previous HPN100 study applicable . Known hypersensitivity PAA PBA . Liver transplant , include hepatocellular transplant . Breastfeeding lactate female .</criteria>
