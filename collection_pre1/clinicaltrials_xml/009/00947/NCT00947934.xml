The primary objective prospective , non-controlled , pilot study assess feasibility safety DBS AD patient mild cognitive memory impairment , evaluate efficacy DBS slow stabilize decline . Five patient AD ( DSM IV ) diagnose less two year , mild cognitive decline ( MMSE 20-24 ) , specific impairment episodic memory include 2-year period .

	<brief_title>Study Brain Stimulation Effect Memory Impairment Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) common cause dementia estimate prevalence rise 5 million US . AD patient display progressive impairment episodic memory instrumental sign include aphasia , apraxia , agnosia , together general cognitive decline , death occur 6-9 year diagnosis . Up , treatment show consistent efficacy stop slow disease . Recently , show memory ability enhance bilateral chronic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) fornix hypothalamus , patient initially treat malignant obesity ( Hamani C , Ann Neurol , 2008 ) . This report show neuro-anatomic circuit involve memory process reachable modulate . This modulation may therapeutic implication AD patient memory decline . The primary objective prospective , non-controlled , pilot study evaluate feasibility safety DBS AD patient mild cognitive memory impairment , evaluate efficacy DBS slow stabilize decline . The secondary objective determine cognitive memory aspect improve , duration efficacy DBS AD symptom . The inclusion criterion : patient AD ( DSM IV ) diagnose less two year , age 50 65 , mild cognitive decline ( MMSE 20 24 ) , specific impairment episodic memory ( use free cue selective remind test : FCSRT ) , able give sign inform consent . Patients associated DSM I axis pathology , contra-indication surgery MRI , preoperative MRI abnormality include . Five patient include 2-year period . The evaluation criterion feasibility proportion patient undergoing procedure , chronic stimulation evaluation process without adverse event ( AE ) . Efficacy evaluate use numerous cognitive memory test include WAIS , MMSE , ADAS scale , TMT-A TMT-B testing , language evaluation , FCSRT Rey figure . CGI IADL evaluate global improvement . Neuro-imaging change stimulation evaluate morphological MRI ( hippocampal volume ) functional imaging ( PET ) . Changes behavioral mood scale , change hypothalamic function ( clinical , biological hormonal assessment ) evaluate safety tolerance . Experimental paradigm : Clinical , neuro-psychological , biological imaging assessment perform 3 one month 3 , 6 , 12 24 month surgery . Bilateral electrode ( Medtronic 3389 ) implant , local anesthesia , MR-guided frame-based stereotaxy , hypothalamic part fornix , entry mamillary body ( well define T2 weight sequence ) . Intraoperative stimulation use search adverse effect acute effect . Electrodes connect generator ( Kinetra , Medtronic ) general anesthesia . Chronic high-frequency stimulation deliver immediately surgery . Expected result perspective : Spontaneously , neuropsychological score progressively decline time AD patient ( MMSE 3-4 point decrease ADAS 6 point increase per year ) . We expect slow , stabilize score 6 , 12 24 month stimulation . In case efficacy DBS might offer AD patient possibility slow down/stabilize symptom , treatment currently offer , increase quality life .</detailed_description>
