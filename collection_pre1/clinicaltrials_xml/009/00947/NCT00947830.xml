	<brief_summary>The purpose study find level imatinib bloodstream , level leukemia cell predict quickly chronic myeloid leukemia improve treatment . 1.1 Primary Objectives To determine intracellular level Imatinib leukemic blood cell within two week treatment initiation patient chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase predict molecular cytogenetic response 6 12 month post treatment 1.2 . Secondary Objectives 1.2.1 To determine hOCT-1 mRNA level diagnosis predict Imatinib intracellular level within two week treatment initiation . 1.2.2 To determine correlation intracellular Imatinib level two week treatment initiation plasma Imatinib level two four week treatment initiation . 1.2.3 To determine plasma Imatinib level four week treatment initiation correlate plasma Imatinib level 12 month treatment initiation . 1.2.4 To determine intracellular level Imatinib leukemic blood cell within two week treatment initiation correlate intracellular level Imatinib normal leukocytes 12 month treatment initiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use imatinib treatment chronic myeloid leukemia significantly improve survival patient disease . This drug work directly inhibit cancer-causing protein BCR-ABL find inside leukemia cell therefore first successful target treatment cancer . Measuring amount gene product BCR-ABL sensitive laboratory technique decrease therapy extremely helpful monitoring disease activity . Furthermore , subgroup patient whose leukemia cell decrease thousand-fold measure sensitive technique first one two year , patient great 97 % chance disease remain excellent control five year . Therefore , discover test would predict marked decrease BCR-ABL gene product early timepoints treatment change could do would useful . To study , test measure amount imatinib patient 's bloodstream plasma recently develop national reference laboratory , Warnex Medical Laboratories Laval , Quebec . Preliminary result national laboratory indicate patient differ much imatinib body absorb get bloodstream , patient absorb imatinib less well slightly low chance thousand-fold reduction leukemia level . However , imatinib must get inside leukemia cell inhibit BCR-ABL , likely amount imatinib inside leukemia cell would predict even good response drug . Warnex Laboratories recently develop test measure imatinib level inside cell , preliminary result indicate patient differ much imatinib get inside cell . Dr. Suzanne Kamel-Reid 's laboratory Toronto General Hospital also develop test measure amount gene product pore imatinib use enter leukemia blood cell ( call h-OCT-1 ) , preliminary result also show differs among patient . It clear difference due difference leukemia cels patient , difference way imatinib would get blood cell patient . Therefore undertake current study see ( 1 ) test , combination test ( bloodstream imatinib level , imatinib level inside cell , h-OCT-1 level ) best predicts well patient patient respond imatinib sensitive test BCR-ABL , ( 2 ) whether difference patient level inside cell due specifically leukemia cell . In trial , measure level patient begin treatment chronic myeloid leukemia imatinib . For practical purpose , participation trial would require patient extra blood sample draw several visit would normally see hematologist/oncologist monitor disease treatment : within 28 day include Day 1 long collect prior start treatment Imatinib , Imatinib treatment start , 2 week , one month , 6 month , 12 month . By obtain information , may better understand adjust imatinib therapy achieve best response patient future .</detailed_description>
