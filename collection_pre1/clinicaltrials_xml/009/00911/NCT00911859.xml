	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness CNTO 328 ( siltuximab ) administer together velcade-melphalan-prednisone ( VMP ) comparison VMP alone participants multiple myeloma ( type cancer affect blood bone marrow ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare CNTO 328 ( Anti-IL-6 Monoclonal Antibody ) VELCADE-Melphalan-Prednisone ( VMP ) With VMP Alone Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 2 part ( Part 1 Part 2 ) consist screen period 2 week ; treatment period ; maintenance period ( CNTO 328 hereafter refer siltuximab ) maximum 18 month follow period study end . Part 1 open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single group safety lead-in part evaluate safety siltuximab . Approximately 12 patient treat siltuximab combination VMP . If safety profile combination acceptable , study proceed Part 2 . Part 2 randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , open-label , 2-arm ( Arm A : siltuximab + VMP ; Arm B : VMP alone ) study . Approximately 104 patient equally randomize , follow maintenance period siltuximab particiants Arm A achieve partial response ( PR ) well . Particiants part study treat maximum nine 6-week cycle provide evidence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal treatment . Study medication continue least 2 additional cycle confirmation complete response , preferably full 9 cycle treatment period . Participants receive maintenance treatment 12-month effectiveness analysis may continue receive treatment siltuximab careful consideration treat physician evidence clinical benefit absence unwarranted toxicity . Safety assessment include evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , eastern cooperative oncology group performance status , electrocardiogram , vital sign , physical examination monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
