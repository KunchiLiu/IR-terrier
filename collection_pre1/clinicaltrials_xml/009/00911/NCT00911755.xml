	<brief_summary>Endotracheal Intubation ( ETI ) do place plastic tube patient 's trachea ( windpipe ) assist breathe . Patients admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) sick patient majority require life saving procedure . A critical illness sudden ETI require urgently . The doctor perform ETI situation may expert ETI . Studies show take one attempt get tube right position patient severe complication : decrease level oxygen body , decrease blood pressure , cardiac arrest . These complication life threaten increase length time spend ICU . To perform ETI doctor use metal tool call laryngoscope place patient 's mouth open throat pas tube trachea . The type procedure use many year call Direct Laryngoscopy ( DL ) mean doctor look mouth directly throat . Newer technology available use VGH call Video Laryngoscopy ( VL ) . With VL camera end laryngoscope video image display monitor make easy see entrance trachea . VL available case VGH unavailable many hospital . In study compare DL VL . Patients randomly place one two group : first attempt ETI do DL first attempt ETI do DL . Patients consider eligible study doctor feel either DL VL would appropriate patient . In pilot study hope show conducting large study would feasible . If large study show VL decrease complication shortens length ICU stay would able recommend procedure ETI VGH well hospital currently may available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : In study , hypothesize videolaryngoscopy ( VL ) associate decrease risk intubation failure compare direct laryngoscopy critically ill. We also hypothesize VL associate few number intubation attempt decrease risk complication compare DL . Background : In critically ill , endotracheal intubation high-risk procedure complication occur 54 % patient . Our published work demonstrate one attempt intubation occur 33 % patient associated three-fold increase risk severe complication . VL provide superior laryngeal view compare DL may translate less failed intubation , resultant decrease complication . Specific objective : 1 . Determine point estimate failure intubate first attempt , use power large efficacy trial examine VL vs. DL critically ill. 2 . Compare VL vs. DL risk intubation failure ( define one attempt ) 3 . Compare VL vs. DL number attempt endotracheal intubation , time-to-intubate , risk complication . Methods : 1 . Design : Single center , randomized-controlled pilot study 2 . Patients : Forty critically ill patient require urgent endotracheal intubation ( within 30 minute ) intensive care team . 3 . Intervention : Patients randomize initial attempt intubation VL v DL . 4 . Power Calculation : Given pilot study generate point estimate , power calculation perform . However , 20 patient arm provide robust point estimate use power future efficacy study . 5 . Analysis : Data analyze intention-to-treat fashion . Our primary objective , failure intubate first attempt , analyze use Fisher 's exact test . This test also use analyze risk complication compare VL DL . Number attempts intubation time-to-intubation analyze use Wilcoxon rank-sum test . 6 . Potential Pitfalls : As slow recruitment always concern , conservatively estimate 5 patient enrol per month , thus require total 8 month patient accrual . Significance : If VL result few complication endotracheal intubation , technique may become widely adopt high risk procedure . Furthermore , many center , anesthesiology support airway management critically ill may limit , present . Thus , impact research may even applicable outside tertiary teaching center airway management expertise readily available .</detailed_description>
