	<brief_summary>The incidence community-associated ( CA ) staphylococcal infection , especially cause methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , increase dramatically recent year . Although majority infection limit skin soft tissue thus life threatening , number invasive case otherwise healthy individual increase fatal . As first step toward understand pathogenesis , significant focus elucidate key CA-MRSA virulence factor . The relative significance factor still delineate . By comparison , little focus host factor associate invasive infection . In protocol , recruit 100 otherwise healthy subject invasive staphylococcal infection , 50 otherwise healthy subject recurrent staphylococcal infection , obtain sample 150 unidentified healthy control blood bank investigate host immunologic factor predispose people staphylococcal infection . Subjects receive standard care treatment acute recurrent staphylococcal infection . The primary objective research identify host genetic factor contribute susceptibility severity community acquire staphylococcal disease . We use three experimental approach complete objective : 1 ) expression microarray analyse study population ( subject control ) white cell ( neutrophils peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) rest stimulate staphylococci , 2 ) evaluation toll-like receptor ( TLR ) pathways study population cell , 3 ) evaluation Th17 cell . The propose research address key area staphylococcal pathogenesis strike lack information .
