	<brief_summary>Between 30 % 88 % chemotherapy patient receive docetaxel experience side effect hand range skin nail disfigurement , blistering , desquamation , pain , infection , impair treatment-related quality life function . Preliminary data indicate nurse-initiated cryotherapy treatment may lower incidence severity side effect , several issue address intervention implement hospital setting . These include rigorous study design , large sample frame , consideration infection control concern . This study address issue , thereby rigorously evaluate safety efficacy nurse-initiated cryotherapy Princess Alexandra Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Intervention Docetaxel-induced Nail Toxicities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research problem : Internationally , cryotherapy docetaxel-induced nail skin toxicity hand become popular primary treatment . Yet little evidence beyond one Phase II , non-randomised , ( n=45 ) study support widespread use . There also unanswered concern relate potential treatment cross-infect patient risk immunocompromise . This phase II case-control study extend previous work address sample size concern , enhance methodological rigour add new evidence respect infection control , prior possible implementation Princess Alexandra Hospital ( PAH ) . Hypothesis/questions/outcomes : Aim : This study investigate utility , efficacy safety cryotherapy , form frozen gel glove , respect prevention docetaxel-induced nail skin toxicity cancer patient . Hypotheses : H1 : Cryotherapy reduce incidence severity docetaxel-induced nail skin toxicity . H2 : Cryotherapy prevent docetaxel-induced nail skin toxicity tolerate cancer patient . H3 : A standardised decontamination protocol prevent healthcare-acquired infection potentially associate cryotherapy . Anticipated result : The primary endpoint decrease incidence severity nail skin toxicity course treatment , measure CTCAE score . Secondary endpoint include delayed time occurrence nail skin toxicity ; patient comfort ; successful glove decontamination protocol evidence absence epidemiologically significant organism frozen glove . Research design : Population sampling : Approximately 300 new breast , prostate lung cancer patient diagnose per year PAH . Not treated docetaxel , place clinical trial , available enrolment study . Data PAH Human Information Management Services indicate approximately 120 patient therefore eligible enrol study . Accounting 50 % rate refusal failure meet study criterion , anticipate approximately 60 patient enrol study 12 month . This amount 60 control 60 intervention hand comparison . Withdrawal criterion : severe cold intolerance withdrawal consent . Procedure : Standard cryotherapy comprise disposable cotton glove overlay glycerine gel-filled glove , cover hand wrist separate thumb rest hand . The gel glove frozen least 3 hour -0.25 -0.30Â°C prior use . Each patient 's hand randomly allocate intervention control . Each patient wear triple glove set intervention hand . No glove set use hand , act case control . During docetaxel infusion , patient wear glove total 90 minute ( 15 minute administration docetaxel , 1-hour docetaxel infusion , 15 minute end infusion ) . This standard procedure cryotherapy ensure patient ' periphery vasoconstricted commencement infusion enough time afterwards ensure circulate drug reach target area . Because duration infusion , one gel glove use successively ( 45 minute ) maintain consistently low temperature hand nail . Using method , study determine comparative incidence skin nail disorder without cold protection . The additional infection control measure study incorporates ( 1 ) insertion disposable surgical glove ( exceeds length cotton gel glove ) cotton gel glove minimise risk cross-contamination ( 2 ) surface decontamination use standard cleaning protocol . The term 'cleaning ' refers use mechanical action , detergent warm water , follow rinse drying . It aim remove organic matter , visible soil salt glove surface . Cleaning remove bulk micro-organism surface also unable multiply inanimate surface clean dried manner . In accordance Spaulding Classification System glove clean protocol incorporate 1 ) clean internal external surface neutral detergent warm water ; 2 ) rinse clean water ; 3 ) clean internal external surface 70 % alcohol-based solution ; 4 ) complete air dry glove . Data collection : Patients receive docetaxel every 21 day 126 - 189 day ( i.e . 6 9 separate occasion ; docetaxel administer day 1 cycle ) . Nail skin toxicity appear day 36 72 untreated patient , increase severity end treatment2-6,8 . Cryotherapy commence day 1 ; occur every 21 day docetaxel administration thereafter , cease final dose docetaxel . Patients ' toxicity assess independently prior commencement docetaxel infusion , three-weekly thereafter , 2 blind clinical nurse assessor use Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events1 . The assessor train dermatologist rating toxicity prior study commencement . The training also establish inter-rater reliability rating assessor , use digital photograph skin nail toxicity already available clinical trial record Princess Alexandra Hospital . In addition blind in-clinic assessment , digital photography hand undertaken standardise light condition prior commencement infusion . This enable nurse ' assessment regularly compare dermatologist 's assessment ensure inter-rater reliability . Because final infusion may also affect nails beyond treatment cessation , nail assessment also undertaken 3 week last infusion routine OPD follow-up . Patients ' comfort level cryotherapy also assess infusion , use 4-point rating system determine whether patient dissatisfy ( 0 ) , satisfy ( 1 ) , satisfy ( 2 ) , satisfy ( 3 ) treatment term glove contact , temperature tolerance immobilisation constraint . A pre-post assessment decontamination protocol gel glove treatment session also undertake . Microbial Cultural Sensitivity ( MC &amp; S ) antibiograms undertaken swab take glove surface T1 ( pre-decontamination ) T2 ( post- decontamination ) . Sites swab glove standardise 1 ) internal glove surface back hand ; 2 ) internal glove surface palm hand ; 3 ) internal glove surface tip second index finger ; 4 ) internal glove surface tip thumb . These sit well-established problematic cleaning decontamination hand hygiene , carriage microbial organism high31 . MC &amp; S antibiograms test non-multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( nmMRSA ) ; multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus , extend spectrum ( VRE ) . A client record form record update relevant demographic , disease- treatment-related data time point . Data analysis : Analyses skin nail toxicity replicate method use original study , undertaken intention-to-treat basis . Matched-pair t-tests use determine statistical significance difference incidence severity nail skin toxicity protect unprotected hand . Because time-to-event endpoint use , Kaplan-Meier log-rank method estimate difference time toxicity occurrence . The impact nail skin toxicity occurrence confounders covariates determine via multivariate Cox regression analysis . Frozen glove contamination analyse determine frequency type micro-organism .</detailed_description>
