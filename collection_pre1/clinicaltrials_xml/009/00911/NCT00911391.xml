	<brief_summary>Perioperative fluid management historically dictate outdated , contradictory concept . Excessive inadequate fluid administration around surgery deleterious hence goal-directed fluid therapy use Oesophageal Doppler-derived cardiac index preferable optimize tissue perfusion . Previous study area hamper lack standardization aspect perioperative care none explore impact individualized fluid therapy post-operative fatigue.The investigator propose study involve 80 patient open/ laparoscopic colonic surgery investigate effect Oesophageal Doppler guide fluid administration intraoperatively compare current best practice fluid restriction . The investigator optimize peri-operative care pathway establish Manukau Surgical Centre ( MSC ) , Middlemore Hospital . All patient care Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) multimodal care plan therefore ensure aspect care besides intraoperative fluid administration remain homogenous . Outcomes include post-operative recovery , clinical outcome well physiological data follow-up 30 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until recently , modern perioperative fluid management involve routine administration large quantity fluids major surgical procedure , typically cause weight increase 3-6 kg early post-operative period.Several factor , include concern preoperative dehydration , attempt support circulation cardiac function general regional anaesthesia , prevention blood transfusion maintenance adequate kidney perfusion historically lead excess perioperative fluid administration . However administration excess fluid show contribute postoperative morbidity . It increase demand heart may adversely affect postoperative cardiac function . It may also lead increase pulmonary complication . Fluid overload may lead oedema gastrointestinal tract hence contribute post-operative gastrointestinal paralysis , bacterial translocation sepsis . Excess fluid also show decrease tissue oxygen tension potential deleterious effect anastomotic wound heal . Therefore , current best practice centre fluid restriction peri-operatively increased focus intraoperative fluid regimen . Since hypovolaemia also associate myriad adverse outcome , balance perioperative intravenous fluid regimen focus tissue perfusion think optimal . By use Oesophageal Doppler Monitor ( ODM ) mean non-invasively estimate intra-operative cardiac output , significant improvement outcome observed patient undergo major orthopaedic cardiac procedure . Previous study patient undergo major abdominal surgery demonstrate goal-directed intraoperative fluid administration use ODM may result improve outcome reduce number critical care admission , reduce hospital stay overall decreased morbidity . In broad context perioperative care colonic surgery , recent development include Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) programmes- combination various evidence-based strategy implement together part standardise protocol synergistically decrease post-operative fatigue improve outcome . These strategy include preoperative counselling , avoidance mechanical bowel preparation , pre-operative carbohydrate loading , perioperative high-flow oxygen therapy , mid-thoracic epidural analgesia , avoidance parenteral opioids routine wound drainage , use short transverse incision , early mobilisation , early feeding balance analgesia regiment . ERAS protocols also ideal well-designed clinical trial provide template trial new intervention background otherwise homogenous , optimise perioperative care programme . An ERAS programme implement prospectively evaluate Manukau Surgical Centre , Middlemore Hospital Auckland . In recently publish systematic review , identified major short-coming literature field non-standardised nature peri-operative management patient study . Although fluid management optimise , aspect care optimise even standardise , introduce risk significant confounding . Furthermore , none explore role fluid management post-operative functional recovery- important metric patient-relevant outcome evaluate recovery beyond physiological clinical parameter . Furthermore , none publish ERAS programme use ODM part peri-operative strategy . Consequently , true impact optimise fluid therapy within environment current best-practice ( ERAS ) unknown . Methods Research Design We conduct double-blinded , randomise control trial ODM versus fluid restriction ( current best-practice ) patient undergo colonic surgery within ERAS programme determine whether individualise fluid administration enhance post-operative recovery , thereby improve patient outcome . Sample Size : To detect 20 % improvement recovery measure Surgical recovery Score Day 7 ( base data previous work ) , require 37 patient arm ( α= 0.05 , β= 0.8 ) Therefore , shall aim recruit 80 patient anticipate possible drop-outs . Patients consent randomised computer generate random number opaque envelope method . All Patients oesophageal probe insert reading available anaesthetist patient control group ( screen cover ) . At commencement anaesthesia , patient randomise receive fluid management optimise ODM data standard parameter . The patient , surgeon investigator blind intervention . The anaesthetist use validate protocol treatment group . Measurements cardiac index ( Cardiac Output , Aortic Flow Rate ) ODM note intraoperatively . The Oesophageal probe shall remove end surgery prior patient wake . All aspect perioperative care accord previously develop ERAS programme .</detailed_description>
