	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect give bevacizumab together docetaxel cyclophosphamide see well work treat patient early-stage high-risk breast cancer . This single arm , non randomise pilot study investigate safety combination Docetaxel + Cyclophosphamide+ Bevacizumab adjuvant treatment patient early stage , HER 2 negative , high risk breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess feasibility combination adjuvant bevacizumab , docetaxel , cyclophosphamide patient early-stage HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer . - Determine safety regimen regard cardiac toxicity , hypertension , bleed complication patient . Secondary - Evaluate efficacy regimen measure Topo II overexpression patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 4 cycle Docetaxel 75mg/m2 + 4 cycle Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 ( cycle last 21 day ) ( +/- 3 day due date could meet public holiday , etc ) concomitant Avastin ( Bevacizumab ) 15mg/kg q 3weeks treatment duration one year . Bevacizumab dose 15mg/kg administer intravenous infusion every 3 week treatment period one year , regardless miss dos . Patients follow 5 year ( i.e . time registration end Year 5/ 1 year treatment 4 year follow ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must histologically confirm , invasive adenocarcinoma breast : Involvement least one axillary lymph node routine histologic examination . ER negative tumour &gt; 2 cm invasive cancer ER positive tumour &gt; 3cm invasive cancer . Note : Premenopausal patient ER positive tumour may participate International Breast Cancer Study Group ( IBCSG ) SOFT study . High risk register intermediate risk randomize chemotherapy patient enrol TAILOR x study may participate study ( prior approval IBCSG ECOG receive ) 2 . Patients must undergo standard surgical treatment breast cancer , consist either mastectomy standard breastconserving operation , include appropriate axillary surgery . Such axillary procedure include either sentinel node biopsy axillary dissection . 3 .
