	<brief_summary>There clear standard care metastatic stomach esophageal cancer United States . The purpose research study determine difference two regimen chemotherapy ; Arm A : PCA ( Cisplatin , Irinotecan Bevacizumab ) Arm B : TPCA ( Docetaxel , Cisplatin , Irinotecan Bevacizumab ) . Docetaxel , Cisplatin , Irinotecan traditional chemotherapy drug . Bevacizumab antibody ( protein attack foreign substance body ) . Bevacizumab believe stop formation new blood vessel carry nutrient tumor . Both chemotherapy regimens ( PCA TPCA ) study patient esophageal gastric cancer , try determine one regimen keep cancer grow improve long live .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin , Irinotecan Bevacizumab ( PCA ) Versus Docetaxel , Cisplatin , Irinotecan Bevacizumab ( TPCA ) Metastatic Esophageal Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because one know study option best , participant randomize one two study group : Arm A Arm B . - For Arm A Arm B , chemotherapy give outpatient setting , week two week row , rest period third week . This three week period time call cycle . - During week one Arm A ( PCA ) participant receive bevacizumab , cisplatin , irinotecan . Arm B ( TPCA ) participant receive bevacizumab , docetaxel , cisplatin irinotecan . - During week two , participant return clinic receive chemotherapy ( arm receive chemotherapy agent bevacizumab ) . Blood test vital sign also collect . - After 2 cycle chemotherapy , participant CT scan do see tumor respond chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
