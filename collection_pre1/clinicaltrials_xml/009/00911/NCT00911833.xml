	<brief_summary>Background : - Genetic research implication drug development marketing . Race-based medicine may able provide specific treatment population increase disease-specific morbidity mortality . However , contemporary genetic research refute idea race genetically distinct population , even drug design use specific race promote . - Studies show high level public suspicion race-based personalized genetic medicine . Concerns related potential performance race-based drug , also motives offer drug . Many participant suggest conspiracy theory race-based medicine disguise attempt provide inferior medication deliberately harm certain population . Concerns personalize medicine often privacy personal concern . - Public suspicion race-based medicine , less extent , personalize genetic medicine , make important examine understand theoretical empirical literature trust health care . Objective : - To describe perspective participant evaluate medicine offer . Eligibility : - Males female age 18 older visit John Hopkins clinic ( primarily adult care clinic ) . - Participants must able take literacy screen respond short survey . Design : - Participants ask take researcher-administrated literacy screen , read one three randomly assign vignette , fill survey . The first page survey provide information study . - Participants respond initial question demographic , experience discrimination , trust medical profession institution . - Each participant receive random vignette he/she imagine him/herself diagnosed common , chronic condition offer conventional drug , race-based drug , genetically personalize drug . - After present vignette , participant ask respond survey ask level trust vignette doctor , perceive respect give patient vignette physician , emotional response vignette , belief effectiveness safety drug prescribe vignette , information sufficiency , hypothetical behavioral intention take drug . - Participants debrief complete survey , offer small amount compensation participating .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Roles Trust Respect Patient Reactions Race-based Personalized Medicine Vignettes : An Experimental Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose describe participant ' attitudinal , emotional , cognitive , hypothetical behavioral response randomize hypothetical vignette illustrate prescription conventional , race-based , genetically personalize medicine common chronic condition . This study theoretically guide conceptualization relationship-centered care risk information seek processing model . These theory recognize importance interpersonal influence within health care interaction , underscore moral dimension patient-physician relationship , describe predictor information attend process . An experimental , mixed method design use randomly assign 357 patient Johns Hopkins clinic one three vignette illustrate conventional , race-based , genetically personalize medication offer . This study aim examine effect type medication offer ( conventional , race-based , genetically personalize ) certain participant characteristic ( race , literacy , background healthcare trust/experience discrimination ) attitudinal , emotional , cognitive , hypothetical behavioral response ; determine relationship among type medication offer four category outcomes moderate race mediate trust ; describe participant ' perspective vignette , target open-ended question .</detailed_description>
