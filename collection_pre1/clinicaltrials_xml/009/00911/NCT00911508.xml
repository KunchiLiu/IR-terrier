	<brief_summary>The ( Catheter Ablation Versus Anti-arrhythmic Drug Therapy Atrial Fibrillation Trial ) CABANA Trial overall goal establish appropriate role medical ablative intervention atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . The CABANA Trial design test hypothesis treatment strategy leave atrial catheter ablation purpose eliminate atrial fibrillation ( AF ) superior current state-of-the-art therapy either rate control rhythm control drug decrease incidence composite endpoint total mortality , disable stroke , serious bleeding , cardiac arrest patient untreated incompletely treat AF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation v Anti-arrhythmic Drug Therapy Atrial Fibrillation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need trial arise 1 ) rapidly increase number pt &gt; 60 year age AF accompany symptom morbidity , 2 ) failure anti-arrhythmic drug therapy maintain sinus rhythm reduce mortality , 3 ) rapidly increase application radio-frequency catheter ablation without appropriate evidence-based validation , 4 ) expand impact AF health care cost . This study randomize 2200 patient strategy catheter ablation versus pharmacologic therapy rate rhythm control drug . Each pt 1 ) characteristic similar AFFIRM pt ( ≥65 yo &lt; 65 &gt; 1 risk factor stroke , 2 ) Documented AF warrant treatment , 3 ) Eligibility catheter ablation ≥2 anti-arrhythmic ≥2 rate control drug . Pts follow every 6 month average approximately 5 year undergo repeat trans-telephonic monitor , Holter monitor , CT/MR study assess impact treatment . The CABANA trial disclose role medical non-pharmacologic therapy AF , establish cost impact therapy quality life help determine AF modifiable risk factor increase mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Over precede 6 month : 1 . ≥2 paroxysmal ( electrocardiographic documentation least 1 ) AF episodes lasting ≥1 hour duration : ( terminate spontaneously within 7 day cardioversion perform within 48h AF onset ) : 2. electrocardiographic documentation 1 persistent AF episode : ( sustain ≥7 day cardioversion perform 48h AF onset ) : 3. electrocardiographic documentation 1 longstanding persistent AF episode : ( continuous AF duration &gt; 1 year ) . Warrant active therapy ( within past 3 month ) beyond simple ongoing observation Be eligible catheter ablation ≥2 sequential rhythm control and/or ≥2 rate control drug . Be ≥65 yrs age , &lt; 65 yr one follow risk factor stroke : Hypertension ( treat and/or define BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg ) [ 90 ] , Diabetes ( treat and/or define fast glucose ≥126 mg/dl ) [ 91 ] , Congestive heart failure ( include systolic diastolic heart failure ) , Prior stroke , TIA systemic embolus , Atherosclerotic vascular disease ( previous MI , peripheral arterial disease aortic plaque ) , LA size &gt; 5.0 cm ( volume index ≥40 cc/m2 ) , EF ≤35 . Have capacity understand sign inform consent form . Be ≥18 year age . NOTE Subjects &lt; 65 yrs age whose risk factor hypertension must second risk factor LV hypertrophy qualify.Patients receive new drug therapy initiate within previous 3 month may continue therapy randomized drug therapy arm . Patients may document atrial flutter addition atrial fibrillation remain eligible enrollment . Lone AF absence risk factor stroke patient &lt; 65 year age Patients opinion manage clinician yet receive therapy AF Patients fail &gt; 2 membrane active antiarrhythmic drug therapeutic dose due inefficacy side effect ( Table 5.2.2 ) An efficacy failure full dose amiodarone treatment &gt; 8 week duration time Reversible cause AF include thyroid disorder , acute alcohol intoxication , recent major surgical procedure , trauma Recent cardiac event include MI , PCI , valve bypass surgery precede 3 month Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( outflow track ) Class IV angina Class IV CHF ( include past plan heart transplantation ) Other arrhythmias mandate antiarrhythmic drug therapy ( i.e . VT , VF ) Heritable arrhythmia increase risk torsade de pointes class I III drug Prior LA catheter ablation intention treat AF Prior surgical intervention AF MAZE procedure Prior AV nodal ablation Patients arrhythmias require ablative therapy Contraindication appropriate anticoagulation therapy Renal failure require dialysis Medical condition limit expect survival &lt; 1 year Women childbearing potential ( unless postmenopausal surgically sterile ) Participation clinical mortality trial ( Participation nonmortality trial review clinical trial management center ) Unable give inform consent NOTE Prior ablation cavotricuspid isthmus alone exclusion patient develop subsequent recurrent AF . Planned atrial flutter ablation combination leave atrial ablation exclusion .</criteria>
