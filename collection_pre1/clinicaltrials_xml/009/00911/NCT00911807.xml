	<brief_summary>The study perform compare safety efficacy Cerebrolysin ( 10 mililiters [ ml ] ) , Aricept ( 10 miligrams [ mg ] ) , combination treatment cognitive performance global function patient probable Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . It also assess treatment positive effect activity daily live neuropsychiatric symptom . Oral treatment Aricept Placebo give daily throughout study . Intravenous treatment Cerebrolysin Placebo give daily 5 day per week week 1 4 week 13 16 study . During study patient six visit hospital evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endogenous neurotrophic factor , also call neurotrophins , signal molecule various cellular pathway allow proper neuronal function , survival regeneration . Sufficient supply therefore regard pre-requisite neuronal maintenance sudden chronic pathological change result imbalance regulatory system . Cerebrolysin peptide preparation act similar way like endogenous neurotrophic factor . Due pleiotropic effect - neuroprotection , neuronal survival , neuroplasticity neurogenesis - , Cerebrolysin regard potential therapeutic tool complex disease like stroke dementia . In contrast naturally occur neurotrophic factor , neuropeptides Cerebrolysin enter brain parenchyma cross blood-brain barrier peripheral ( intravenous [ IV ] ) administration . Another treatment approach Alzheimer 's disease target cholinergic system increase cortical acetylcholine . One drug anticholinesterase donepezil ( Aricept ) . However , anticholinesterases seem provide symptomatic benefit limited period influence progression disease . In view different mechanism action clinical profile Cerebrolysin Aricept , combination therapy may provide synergistic treatment effect . The combination treatment target neurotrophic axis ( Cerebrolysin ) treatment improve cholinergic neurotransmission ( Aricept ) arguably expect provide additional benefit AD patient .</detailed_description>
