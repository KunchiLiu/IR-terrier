	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Safety Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) Vaccine Patients With SLE : Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genital infection human papillomavirus ( HPV ) one common sexually transmitted infection Hong Kong . Most case HPV infection asymptomatic . However , individual , especially patient immunocompromised , HPV infection persistent may result genital wart , cervical smear abnormality , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) rarely cervical cancer . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) disease predominantly affect woman childbearing age . Patients SLE risk persistent HPV infection . This immunosuppressive state induce various treatment . The prevalence abnormal Pap smear cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) SLE patient higher age-matched healthy woman . Thus , prevention HPV infection important patient SLE reduce incidence CIN lesion hence invasive cervical cancer long run . The quadrivalent HPV vaccine , GARDASIL effective reduce occurrence high-grade CIN lesion anogenital disease elate HPV-16 HPV-18 infection . Vaccination young woman age 16 23 year result seroconversion rate 99 % HPV type ( 6,11,16,18 ) well tolerate . There little information regard efficacy quadrivalent HPV vaccine immunocompromised host . The objective current study evaluate immunogenicity safety quadrivalent HPV vaccine group patient SLE term antibody conversion . Comparison make equal number age-matched healthy woman .</detailed_description>
