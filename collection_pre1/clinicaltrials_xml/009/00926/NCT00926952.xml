	<brief_summary>Actinic keratoses face often numerous widespread . The application Methylaminolevulinate ( MAL ) individual lesion follow application plastic film lesion difficult take time subject many actinic keratoses . The wait period 3 hour MAL cream application red light exposure also long patient . The goal study evaluate safety efficacy photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) MAL shorter cream application time ( 90 minute ) MAL apply entire face without plastic film .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Incubation Methylaminolevulinate Photodynamic Therapy Without Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 20 patient least 5 non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses ( AK ) face include open-label study . All AKs map transparent template first PDT treatment . At Day 0 , patient receive methylaminolevulinate ( MAL ) apply entire face ( except nose peri-ocular area 1-2 cm ) without skin preparation . One two 2 g MAL tube use entire face . MAL apply without occlusion . After total 90 +/- 5 minute skin rinse expose 37 J/cm² red light Aktilite™ device . Patients see Week 4 ; facial AKs show complete response treatment , MAL-PDT procedure repeat Week 4 . Patients see Week 12 24 . The primary endpoint Week 12 . Patients come back Week 24 final safety evaluation verify recurrence AK . Efficacy evaluate assess mean number facial AK Week 12 compare Day 0 .</detailed_description>
