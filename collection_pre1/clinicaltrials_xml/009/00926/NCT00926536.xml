	<brief_summary>Patients enrol base presence HCC eligibility TACE . They randomize one two arm image navigation optimal catheter location chemotherapy injection treat first ( possibly sole ) tumor target . The two arm : TACE use C-arm CT supplement DSA DSA ( DSA image use navigation tumor vessel track ) . Navigation subsequent treatment target patient do fluoroscopy , CACT , DSA , standard care Stanford University Medical Center , part study . Vascular complexity , affect navigation difficulty thus need image , assess separately use data analysis two radiologist four-point scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact C-arm CT Patients With HCC Undergoing TACE : Optimal Imaging Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope learn utility C-arm CT patient undergo TACE HCC . Data evaluate regard : 1 . Sensitivity specificity diagnose additional tumor impact transplantation criterion . 2 . The ability decrease procedural time aid navigation complex arterial anatomy . 3 . Impact radiation dose . Although patient would receive radiation C-arm CT , overall number DSA angiogram fluroscopy may decrease , potentially negate effect additional dose C-arm CT</detailed_description>
