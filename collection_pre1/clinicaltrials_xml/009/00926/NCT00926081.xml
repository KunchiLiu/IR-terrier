	<brief_title>Exercise Training Versus Best Medical Treatment Only Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) affect 7 - 12 % population age 50 year . Over age 60 year 20 % suffer PAD Western society . Both , percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) surgical repair ( bypass graft , thrombectomy ) well establish procedure improve peripheral arterial perfusion . However , long-term result remain disappointing : Low patency-rates associate clinical deterioration . Moreover , clinical outcome often limit early major cardiovascular adverse event ( myocardial infarction , stroke ) . Therefore , medical therapy play major role management PAD patient : Antihypertensive medication , statins well adequate diabetes therapy important cornerstone therapeutical management PAD . Prior study show regular supervise exercise training improve patientsÂ´walking impairment . We hypothesize regular supervised exercise training significantly improve Quality Life decrease occurence future major cardiovascular adverse event . We aim investigate effect exercise training peripheral microcirculation endothelial progenitor cell .</detailed_description>
