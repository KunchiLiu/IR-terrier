	<brief_title>Chest Wall Repair Rib Fractures After Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Rib fracture repair utilize open reduction internal fixation commercially available rib plat system improve outcome ( i.e. , infectious complication ) , decrease hospital stay mortality . Study Design : This prospective , observational study 50 patient , due injury pattern , operative candidate open reduction internal fixation commercial available rib plat system one follow indication : 1 . Flail chest with/without failure wean ventilator 2 . Significantly displace rib fracture with/without lung impalement 3 . Symptomatic multiple rib fracture - Failure pain control Outcome measure evaluate include : 1 . Hospital Mortality 2 . Ventilator free day 3 . Need tracheotomy 4 . Infectious Complications ( pneumonia , bacteremia , UTI , empyema ) 5 . Hospital &amp; ICU Days 6 . Disposition follow discharge</detailed_description>
