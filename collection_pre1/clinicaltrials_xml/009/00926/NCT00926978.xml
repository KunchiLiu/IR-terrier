	<brief_summary>This research study compare radiopharmacokinetics I-124 radiopharmacokinetics I-131 patient well-differentiated thyroid cancer recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone ( rhTSH ) injection . I-131 routinely use image dosimetry patient well-differentiated thyroid cancer . In study , I-124 administer orally capsular form , radiopharmacokinetics I-124 compare I-131 . I-124 another isotope iodine , cyclotron-produced . I-124 multiple advantage : - Ideal Half-Life ( 4.2 day ) delay image . - High resolution tomographic imaging . - Feasibility quantitating lesion uptake . - Potential dosimetry plan radioiodine therapy . Voluntary patient I-124 dosimetry perform addition I-131 dosimetry , plan part routine clinical care . I-124 dosimetry compose four part : ( 1 ) two extra dos injection rhTSH , ( 2 ) administration I-124 , ( 3 ) PET imaging , ( 4 ) draw blood sample . Patients receive two additional injection rhTSH . This similar procedure I-131 dosimetry . Second , receive I-124 . I-124 similar I-131 except I-124 decay different way emit positron PET scanner use image . I-124 give form one several capsule , take mouth . This also similar I-131 . Third , PET/CT image do approximately 30 minute one hour five consecutive day . Radiation PET/CT scan far less receive diagnostic CT scan . For fourth part , technologist draw 5 cc forearm five consecutive day . This also similar I-131 . Initially , patient randomize one two study group . The first group I-131 dosimetry perform first follow I-124 dosimetry , second group I-124 dosimetry perform first follow I-131 dosimetry . The risk study consider low , potential benefit patient consider high .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiopharmacokinetics Dosimetric Calculations A tracer dosage either I-131 I-124 first administer patient , clearance follow specified period . In classical approach , blood consider critical organ irradiate either - particle emit activity blood , - emission originate activity disperse throughout remainder body . Therefore two compartment need monitor radioactivity : ( ) blood ( b ) whole body . Based classical dosimetry approach , radiation dose whole blood cGy ( rad ) per MBq I-131 calculate . The calculation area two curve base mathematical fit data point use multiple exponential function . Since data collection terminate 4 day curve must extrapolate infinity . A conservative estimate employ assume clearance follow final measure data point base simply physical decay . This ignore biological clearance result overestimation area tail hence radiation dose per millicurie administer . Each patient follow calculate . . Whole body radiopharmacokinetics ii . Blood radiopharmacokinetics iii . Whole blood dosimetry iv . Lesion Kinetics . Whole body radiopharmacokinetics As alternative use external probe measure whole body retention , dual detector gamma camera system use . In case patient scan whole body mode reproducible geometry lie supine imaging table . This method generally accept patient-specific whole body dosimetry I-131 radiolabeled antibody . Furthermore , show yield comparable result external probe data . This technique follow feature : - Simultaneous anterior posterior image use high-energy collimator . - Table height , detector radius , scan length , scan speed , energy window standardize reproduce data point . - Scan speed relatively rapid ( typically use 30 cm/min ) data acquisition complete approximately 8 minute . - Additional scan perform day ( 1 ) background , ( 2 ) count standard ( vial contain 37 MBq ( 1 mCi ) I-131 ) . - Total count image fix region interest encompass entire body use calculation whole body retention . Although image use diagnostic purpose , approach additional advantage reason delay absorption tracer dosage stomach , measurement could repeat 4 hour . During initial 2-hour period follow I-131 administration patient allow urinate defecate . Under circumstance essentially 100 percent dosage contain within patient observation point . The initial image define represent 100 percent value subsequent daily measurement normalize value use formula : When used way , standard correct variation detector sensitivity measurement measurement , well physical decay . Absolute calibration necessary since patient use his/her reference . The whole body I-124 image obtain time point use PET system . In case emission image obtain 1-2 minutes/bed position sufficient number position cover patient head foot . Transmission image also perform correct emission data attenuation . ii . Blood pharmacokinetics The blood sample ( 3-4 ml purple top tube ) count use scintillation well-detector system . Since need determine activity sample , necessary make calibration standard , counted time . This involve addition carefully assayed quantity I-131 ( approximately 3.7 MBq - 7.4 MBq { 100-200 uCi } ) total volume 1000 ml . Such small concentration necessary order avoid saturate detector . An alternative implemented dosimetry program Washington Hospital Center use Ba-133 rod source instead cross-calibrated I-131 standard . With relatively long half-life ( 10.3 year ) similar gamma emission , Ba-133 suitable replacement prepare I-131 standard . At conclusion data acquisition , two 1-ml aliquot whole blood , `` standard '' count . Using information , possible calculate % administer dosage/liter whole blood time sample . A zero time point calculate divide total dosage patient 's total blood volume . However , patient-specific blood volume determine , assume equal 20 % body weight . iii . Whole blood dosimetry The Maximum Treatment Activity ( MTA ) calculate activity I-131 , would deliver combine beta gamma dose blood component 200 cGy ( 200 rad ) . This calculation perform use whole body blood clearance data I-131 I-124 biokinetic clearance data . The I-124 data first correct difference half-lives two radionuclides generate `` equivalent '' I-131 value . iv . Lesion Kinetics For patient focal lesion ( ) visualize clearance curve half-lives determine image I-131 I-124 study . A manually draw region-of interest ( ROI ) place around lesion visualize diagnostic whole body scan perform 48hrs post administration radioiodine . This ROI position comparable area scan . A background ROI adjacent lesion also draw . The total count lesion background correction determine time point . In case PET scan first PET study co-registered diagnostic scan use Hermes image registration tool . The coronal slice add generate whole body scan `` equivalent '' I-131 . Regions interest define manner discuss . A least square single exponential fit apply lesion clearance curve . The half-life exponential compute value derive I-131 compare I-124 identified lesion .</detailed_description>
