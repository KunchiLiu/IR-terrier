	<brief_summary>Research Topic : Over 110,000 HIV Ugandan child risk neurocognitive disorder due progressive encephalopathy CNS HIV infection . Even clinically stable , child motor , attention , memory , visual-spatial processing , executive function impairment . One-hundred fifty school-age child HIV Kayunga District , Uganda , serve participant . Fifty child randomly select receive 24 training session computerize cognitive rehabilitation therapy ( CCRT ) program call Captain 's Log , market mostly American child attention learn problem . A locked version Captain 's Log direct child 's training progressive manner administer second `` active control '' group ; third group passive control group receive computer training intervention . Study Aim 1 : To compare neuropsychological benefit 24 training session Captain 's Log CCRT active passive control group 8-week period , 3-month follow-up . Study Aim 2 : To compare psychiatric benefit 24 training session Captain 's Log CCRT active passive control group 8-week period , 3-month follow-up . Study Aim 3 : To evaluate HIV subtype , ART treatment status , correspond clinical stability child modifies CCRT neuropsychological performance gain psychiatric symptom reduction . Outcome Assessments : The Kaufman Assessment Battery Children , 2nd ed . ( KABC-2 ) , Tests Variables Attention ( TOVA ) visual auditory test , CogState computerize neuropsychological screening test , Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency ( BOT-2 ) , Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) administer 8-week training period 3-month follow-up . We previously use assessment Ugandan child HIV effectively evaluate neuropsychological psychiatric problem . Captain 's Log internal evaluator feature help u monitor specific training task child best respond . Based prior research Kayunga child HIV , anticipate 40 % sample ART study enrollment , 20 % Subtype D 60 % subtype A . We also observe child HIV Subtype A great risk neurocognitive deficit . Analyses : We compare neuropsychological psychiatric gain 8-week training period 3-mo follow-up three study group , anticipate significantly great CCRT intervention child ( Study Aims 1 &amp; 2 ) . These neuropsychological gain associate improved school performance long-term . Intervention child ART great gain ART , HIV subtype D child low viral load higher lymphocyte activation level , result great gain CCRT ( Study Aim 3 ) . Conclusion : CCRT prove effective sustainable potentiate neurocognitive benefit ART HIV child . It prove viable assess treat child resource-poor setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . To evaluate effectiveness CCRT improve cognitive performance outcome Ugandan child HIV . Hypothesis 1a : CCRT improve short long-term cognitive outcome child HIV ; Hypothesis 1b : Improvements performance associate CCRT solely due increase computer exposure . One-hundred fifty school-age child HIV Kayunga District , Uganda , undergo baseline neuropsychological test use Kaufman Assessment Battery Children ( KABC-2 ) , computerized Tests Variables Attention ( TOVA : auditory visual test ) , brief CogState computerize neuropsychological test battery ( CogState ) , Bruininks-Oseretsky Tests Motor Proficiency ( 2nd edition ) ( BOT-2 ) . Cogstate design neuropsychological screening tool minimal practice effect suitable repeated measure design monitor benefit treatment neurocognitive disability11 . Children randomize either : CCRT intervention group ( Captain 's Log active rehabilitation ) , active control group ( Captain 's Log lock , non-rehabilitation mode ) , passive control group ( computer intervention ) . CCRT computer control present 24 session ( ~ 45 min ) 8 week ( 3 session per week ) . After 8-weeks , neurocognitive gain assessed CogState KABC-2 work memory subscales ( primary expect outcome measure ) . The full KABC-2 , TOVA , CogState , BOT-2 re-administered 3 month 8-week assessment . Thus , full battery administer enrollment 3-month follow-up , strategic portion battery administer follow 8 week CCRT intervention period . The combined testing allow u assess short-term longer-term neuropsychological benefit CCRT . Aim 2 . To evaluate effectiveness CCRT reduce psychiatric symptom Ugandan child HIV . Hypothesis 2 : CCRT reduce short- long-term psychiatric symptom child HIV . Previously cerebral malaria survivor , demonstrate significant reduction short-term symptom relate anxiety , depression , somatic complaint assess Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) follow CCRT intervention12 . In aim , caregiver-reported psychiatric symptom CBCL assess enrollment , 8-week CCRT intervention period , 3 month enrollment . The CBCL assessment also help u gauge psychosocial benefit social attention enrichment surround computer exposure active control condition , rather rehabilitative aspect CCRT per se . This evident compare active passive control group . Aim 3 . To evaluate HIV subtype correspond immunological status child modifies CCRT neuropsychological performance gain psychiatric symptom reduction ; .after control quality home environment , nutrition , risk factor poverty . Hypothesis 3 : More aggressive HIV infection type accompany high viral load lower T-cell lymphocyte level decrease neural plasticity , evidence lessen cognitive psychiatric improvement CCRT . Our preliminary data indicates specific HIV Subtype A Ugandan child result higher viral load low T-lymphocyte level school-age child , compare Subtype D infection . These associate poorer neuropsychological outcome . Likewise , preliminary HIV CCRT study Ugandan child HIV , low CD8 CD4 activation level child receive CCRT intervention result less neuropsychological benefit train . We evaluate moderate effect HIV subtype , ART treatment , correspond immunological profile , CCRT neuropsychological psychiatric benefit . The moderating effect HIV progressive encephalopathy brain plasticity also monitor CCRT training progress , measure Captain 's Log Internal Evaluator ( CLIE ) feature program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV child 6 16 year age enrol CAI program eligible parent caregiver consent participation study . They confirm HIV positive child ( ELISA Western blot ) . Only child perinatally acquire HIV infection include . At preCCRT medical examination ( see medical exam form appendix ) exclude child medical history serious birth complication , severe malnutrition , bacterial meningitis , encephalitis , cerebral malaria , know brain injury disorder require hospitalization . Also child seizure neurological disability exclude . This screen use brief medical history questionnaire CAI medical chart review .</criteria>
