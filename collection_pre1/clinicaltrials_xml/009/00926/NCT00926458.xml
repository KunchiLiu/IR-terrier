	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate compare value 5 different non-invasive diagnostic method patient chest pain suspect coronary artery disease . The investigator intend include 200 patient 3 year period study . The participant recruit patient refer coronary angiography institution . Before angiography participant ( 1 ) test effect sublingual Nitroglycerin , ( 2 ) give medical history mathematical model estimate probability presence coronary artery disease , ( 3 ) take part contrast stress echocardiography ( 4 ) 2D-strain stress echocardiography myocardial scintigraphy . Stenosis find angiography gold standard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate diagnostic value various non-invasive method . The study divide five substudies : Substudy NITRO Purpose : To investigate whether subjective effect Nitroglycerine associate significantly narrow coronary artery . The participant instruct alternate rest Nitroglycerine treatment chest pain attack 2 week period . Chest pain score record diary hand day 1 together 30 tablet Nitroglycerine maximal tolerate dose . Substudy SCORE Aim : To test compare ability different statistical method use clinical data predict presence narrow coronary artery contemporary Danish population . Substudy CONTRAST Aim : To evaluate blood flow area heart muscle measure contrast adenosine stress echocardiography predict presence significant stenosis coronary artery supply area . Substudy 2D strain Aim : To Evaluate lack increase 2D strain adenosine stress echocardiography predict presence narrow coronary artery . Substudy SPECT Aim : To evaluate whether result myocardial scintigraphy predict symptomatic chest pain relief 6 month coronary angiography possible treatment balloon bypass surgery . Participants : Annually around 1,500 coronary angiography perform Region Hospital Herning . We intend include 200 patient referred physician coronary angiography study expect data collection phase last 3 year .</detailed_description>
