	<detailed_description>Homeless adult high risk Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) HIV infection due high rate injection drug use unprotected sexual activity . Our NIDA-funded RO1 award enable u implement successful intervention design evaluate effectiveness HBV vaccination intervention homeless adult . Our finding reveal great percent homeless adult randomize Nurse Case Managed Plus Incentive Tracking group complete HAV/HBV vaccine series compare Standard program without track . Homeless person least likely complete vaccine series young ( &lt; 40 ) , men sex men ( MSM ) ; significant number young adult also report methamphetamine ( MA ) cocaine/crack use . Stimulants ( SAs ) , include MA cocaine/crack commonly use homeless MSM , contend disorganize life , unemployment , little access health social service ; thus , HBV vaccination particularly challenging population . HAV/HBV vaccination effective behavioral treatment two important strategy reduce HBV infection among at-risk group SA user . Based upon advice community partner successfully treat SA-using gay bisexual men ( GBM ) , incorporate contingency management vaccination completion program , low completion rate among young adult MSMs . Thus , competitive renewal , propose randomize , experimental , two-group design evaluate effectiveness Nurse Case Managed Program , include specialized education Contingency Management Tracking ( NCCMT ) , Standard Program , include brief education , Contingency Management Tracking ( SCMT ) 500 homeless , young ( 18-39 ) , SA-using GBM , completion Twinrix HAV/HBV vaccine , secondarily , reduction risk hepatitis HIV . This study innovative allow u look effect enhance case management contingency management program versus standard contingency management program . The propose study combine optimal strategy approach , engage intervene hidden high-risk population ass feasibility efficacy intervention may prove beneficial preventing HBV HAV infection . We also assess relative cost program term completion HAV/HBV vaccination series . As use SAs threaten intensify homeless person ' risk exposure HAV HBV , particularly among young user may yet HBV-infected , research target engage group treatment , suitably protect HBV , critical .</detailed_description>
