	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn good treat gonorrhea infection . Gonorrhea sexually transmit disease ( STD ) usually cure single antibiotic . However , gonorrhea cure single antibiotic . The study look well treat gonorrhea 2 antibiotic work . Participants assign 1 2 treatment group receive combination 2 antibiotic . Sites United States recruit 500 male female participant . Participants must 15 60 year old , good health identify participate sexually transmit disease clinic uncomplicated cervical urethral gonorrhea . Procedures include collection current symptom , medical sexual history , sexual orientation , vital sign , height , weight , cervical/urethral culture clinical examination . Volunteers involve 17 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Combination Therapies Gonorrhea Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection Neisseria ( N. ) gonorrhoeae carry significant public health burden United States ( U.S. ) . Gonococcal infection result pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) , ectopic pregnancy , infertility , chronic pelvic pain , increase risk transmission acquisition human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . With 350,000 case gonorrhea report year , gonorrhea second common notifiable condition . Furthermore , estimate case report account half incident case gonorrhea U.S. year . Given gonorrhea bacterial infection cause symptom approximately 90 percent infect men 50 percent infected woman , critical aspect reduce public health burden gonorrhea affect population provision effective antimicrobial therapy . In order identify treatment option patient suspect confirm cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection patient severe cephalosporin hypersensitivity , study plan determine efficacy 2 combination antimicrobial regimens treatment uncomplicated gonococcal infection . This study multicenter clinical trial adult male female diagnose urethral cervical gonococcal infection . Subjects enrol randomize treatment either Regimen A : gentamicin 240 mg intramuscular ( IM ) one time patient &gt; 45 kg 5 mg/kg IM one time patient less equal 45 kg plus azithromycin 2 gm mouth ( PO ) one time , Regimen B : gemifloxacin 320 mg PO one time plus azithromycin 2 gm PO one time . Investigators hypothesize Regimen A clinical efficacy estimate great equal 95 percent well low , one-sided 95 percent confidence interval ( CI 95 percent ) bound great equal 90 percent . The identical hypothesis applies Regimen B . It note comparative trial Regimen A B , rather trial establish efficacy data two candidate regimen . The primary objective study determine microbiological efficacy two combination antimicrobial regimens treatment uncomplicated gonococcal infection ( i.e. , non-systemic ) . Secondary objective study : ass safety tolerability candidate regimen ; ass eradication rectal pharyngeal gonococcal infection regimen ; determine antimicrobial susceptibility profile gonococcal strain isolated time enrollment ; determine clinical antimicrobial susceptibility profile gonococcal strain isolated patient fail treatment ; ass efficacy candidate regimens resolution symptom sign ( clinical cure ) . The primary efficacy analysis base microbiological cure rate end trial base modify intent-to-treat ( MITT ) per protocol ( PP ) subset . The number , percent , 95 percent one-sided ( low ) confidence interval microbiological cure rate success failure compute . Additional analysis conduct follow subset : male , female , men sex men ( MSM ) status , subject deny anal , oral , vaginal intercourse follow-up period . Secondary endpoint include : separate analysis : safety tolerability regimen ; eradication rectal pharyngeal infection ; antimicrobial susceptibility profile enrollment isolate ; clinical antimicrobial susceptibility profile treatment failure ; resolution</detailed_description>
