	<brief_summary>With age population , prevalence age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) eye disease result large number people suffer central vision loss . In fact , prevalent cause blindness among veteran AMD . Since number elderly veteran expect double next 10 year , loss vision due AMD also expect proportionally considerably escalate . People impaired vision difficulty daily activity , , reading , drive , recognize face . The goal research project provide information factor contribute visual impairment . This knowledge necessary development innovative approach optimize benefit vision rehabilitation technique , aim improve vision , thus allow veteran maintain function productivity . The finding propose research benefit veteran age people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vision loss become major public health problem due growth age population . Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) common cause vision loss people 50 year age . In United States , 10 million people AMD 1.6 million people age 50 old late-stage advance AMD . It well establish AMD patient central vision loss use prefer retinal locus ( PRL ) peripheral retinal area adjacent fovea perform daily activity , reading . However , even healthy eye , peripheral vision limit due reduce neural sample density compare fovea . Additionally , function peripheral retina reduce patient , owe degenerative disease process . These neural substrate loss couple loss quality optical image retina . Optical imperfection increase age off-axis viewing , compare view along optical axis eye . The combination factor play significant role reduce visual performance patient eccentric fixation . The long term goal project improve visual performance veteran central vision loss development innovative approach optimize benefit vision rehabilitation technique . In current proposal , optical neural loss assess AMD patient central vision loss use novel technique . Increased optical loss due age view optical axis eye establish wavefront analysis technology . Increased neural loss due retinal dysfunction PRL determine base measurement visual acuity blur stimulus . Improvement read speed evaluate , conditional neural loss PRL and/or stability PRL , compensate optical loss adaptive optic system . The finding provide knowledge PRL function stability beneficial improve outcome available vision rehabilitation method train patient well use PRLs . Also , customized correction optical imperfection eye effectively improve visual performance develop approach well vision rehabilitation patient . Optimizing vision rehabilitation veteran allow maintain function productivity .</detailed_description>
