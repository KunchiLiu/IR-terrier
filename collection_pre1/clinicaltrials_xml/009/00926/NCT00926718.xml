	<brief_summary>Eighty subject recruit schedule surgery require general anesthesia St Vincent 's Hospital . Subjects must American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) status 1 2 ( fairly healthy ) , BMI 18-35 ( reasonably healthy weight ) , age 18 75 . They eligible take certain medication expect difficult intubation . Subjects randomize ( assigned chance ) one four rocuronium dose 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 mg kg-1 . All acceptable clinical dos perform laryngoscopy . In operating room , routine monitor apply , include Bispectral Index ( BIS ) sensor M-Entropy sensor . Subjects receive 0.025 mg kg-1 midazolam ( standard pre-op dose ) put sleep . Once asleep , subject receive rocuronium dose , follow laryngoscopy three minute later . The anesthesiologist perform laryngoscopy know dose rocuronium subject receive . CVI , entropy , amount muscle relaxation , vital sign monitor record throughout procedure . Subjects receive propofol remifentanil infusion case . These commonly use medication anesthesia . The subject also randomize two additional group . One group receive remifentanil infusion 2ng ml-1 group receive 8ng ml-1 remifentanil infusion . Both dose acceptable often used standard clinical care . The propofol infusion adjust keep BIS number 45-60 . The anesthesiologist able see CVI value . The time certain intraoperative event , intubation incision , record . All subject receive morphine bolus ( 0.10-0.15 mg/kg ) towards end reduce post-operative pain , per standard clinical care . As subject wake , time eye open orientation record . The subject rate pain numerical pain scale quality emergence assess . Upon arrival post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , subject ask rate pain use pain scale . The pain score evaluate every 10 minute half hour , every hour discharge PACU .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Rocuronium Response Composite Variability Index ( CVI ) Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Composite Variability Index ( CVI , Aspect Medical System , Norwood MA ) new parameter ( measurement ) provide information amount painful stimulation surgery . It part Bispectral Index ( BIS , Aspect Medical Systems , Norwood MA ) , well-established widely use parameter show awake/asleep patient general anesthesia may indicate need medication . The CVI component provide specific information whether patient need pain medication ( call opioids ) medication make sleep ( call hypnotic ) . The CVI make BIS number measure facial muscle movement ( EMG ) . Both component increase painful stimulation , decrease pain medication give . Neuromuscular block drug ( NMD ) paralyze medication often use surgery relax body make easy surgeon perform surgery anesthesiologist insert breathe tube ( call intubation ) . Facial muscle resistant NMD effect , might affect EMG reading , make CVI le useful patient need NMD . The M-entropy monitor ( GE Healthcare , Helsinki , Finland ) similar BIS monitor CVI affect large NMD dos . The purpose study examine effect rocuronium , NMD , response CVI M-entropy laryngoscopy anesthesia . A laryngoscopy standard way examine open patient 's airway insert breathe tube . It fairly stimulate anesthesiologist sometimes , always , administer NMD ( vary dos ) perform laryngoscopy standard care . Eighty subject recruit schedule surgery require general anesthesia St Vincent 's Hospital . Subjects must ASA status 1 2 ( fairly healthy ) , BMI 18-35 ( reasonably healthy weight ) , age 18 75 . They eligible take certain medication expect difficult intubation . Subjects randomize ( assigned chance ) one four rocuronium dose 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 mg kg-1 . All acceptable clinical dos perform laryngoscopy . In operating room , routine monitor apply , include BIS sensor M-Entropy sensor . Subjects receive 0.025 mg kg-1 midazolam ( standard pre-op dose ) put sleep . Once asleep , subject receive rocuronium dose , follow laryngoscopy three minute later . The anesthesiologist perform laryngoscopy know dose rocuronium subject receive . CVI , entropy , amount muscle relaxation , vital sign monitor record throughout procedure .

One group receive remifentanil infusion 2ng ml-1 group receive 8ng ml-1 remifentanil infusion . Both dose acceptable often used standard clinical care . The propofol infusion adjust keep BIS number 45-60 . The anesthesiologist able see CVI value . The time certain intraoperative event , intubation incision , record . All subject receive morphine bolus ( 0.10-0.15 mg/kg ) towards end reduce post-operative pain , per standard clinical care . As subject wake , time eye open orientation record . The subject rate pain numerical pain scale quality emergence assess . Upon arrival PACU , subject ask rate pain use pain scale . The pain score evaluate every 10 minute half hour , every hour discharge PACU . The total dose pain medication administer PACU record . Upon PACU discharge , subject ask rate overall experience anesthesia . Demographic data also collect . All data keep lock file cabinet study result share research personnel Aspect Medical Systems .</detailed_description>
