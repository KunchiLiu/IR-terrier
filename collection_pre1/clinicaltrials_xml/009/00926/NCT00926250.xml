	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia , age-associated loss skeletal muscle mass strength , frequent precursor functional impairment , disability , fall , loss independence elderly . The prevalence sarcopenia high , â‰¥ 45 % U.S. population age 60 year old sarcopenic . Some possible causative factor include decline muscle protein synthesis , inactivity , hormonal change , pro-inflammatory condition , reactive oxygen specie within muscle mitochondrion , may exacerbate inadequate nutritional intake . Since dietary protein target muscle muscle mass represent large tissue body , protein nutrition play significant role muscle metabolism . SPECIFIC AIMS The specific aim propose study determine effect PS-IPC supplementation muscle mass , muscle strength , muscle quality , inflammatory / immune marker healthy old adult . Subjects score 4 - 10 Short-Physical Performance Battery age 60-85 year consume PS-IPC supplement placebo three time daily 12 week . HYPOTHESES 1 . Subjects consume PS-IPC great increase muscle mass muscle strength compare control group consume placebo supplement . 2 . Subjects consume PS-IPC demonstrate great increase fractional rate muscle protein synthesis compare placebo control group . 3 . Subjects receive PS-IPC reduction plasma concentration various inflammatory marker immune function , compare subject consume placebo .</brief_summary>
