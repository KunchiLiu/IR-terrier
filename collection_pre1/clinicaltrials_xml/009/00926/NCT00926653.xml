	<brief_title>Assessing Anterior Cingulate Brain Activity People With Late-Life Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult depression often also suffer executive dysfunctionâ€”problems plan , impulse control , reason . Executive dysfunction old adult predicts poor delay response antidepressant treatment associate early relapse recurrence late-life major depression . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan measure activity someone 's brain person performs task . So far , fMRI study investigate cerebral activation pattern late-life depression publish . In study , people undergo fMRI perform executive function task . Older adult late-life depression old adult without depression test compare order identify area pattern brain activity underlying executive dysfunction late-life depression . Participation study consist one study visit , participant undergo fMRI scan last 60 90 minute . While scan , participant perform cognitive task involve press button response word view screen .</detailed_description>
