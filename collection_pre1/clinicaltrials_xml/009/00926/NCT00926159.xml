	<brief_summary>Prophylactic implant ICD ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) prevention sudden cardiac death life-threatening heart rhythm abnormality standard recommendation patient ejection fraction ( EFs ) 35 % less . The main purpose trial determine patient receive care community-based cardiology program know low ejection fraction ( EF ) measurement 35 % less per echocardiogram and/or cardiac nuclear scan test approach ICD ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) implant . Additionally , secondary purpose trial : 1 ) determine patient receive recommendation provider undergo prophylactic ICD implant 2 ) identify reason provider recommend ICD implant patient reduce EFs 3 ) determine reason patient recommend ICD implant provider elect implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Appropriate ICD Implantation Primary Prevention Sudden Cardiac Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) patient high risk sudden cardiac death ( primary prevention ) become accepted therapy multiple randomized trial demonstrate benefit consistently . After year extensive evaluation trial data , Center Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) approve national registry endorse American College Cardiology Heart Rhythm Society . Thus , ICD implantation primary prevention sudden cardiac death one intensively evaluate , strictly regulate closely monitored therapy . Since approval expand coverage primary prevention CMS along requirement registry participation early 2005 , ICD implant volume show apparent increase expect many . Instead , flat growth ICD sale observe last 2 year . Several explanation offer various source . Some attribute slow growth loss confidence among refer physician , patient , family member result multiple industry recall . Others claim small portion eligible candidate receive ICD therapy poor awareness ICD benefit among refer physician public ( Cambridge Heart Commercial ) . However , Medtronic campaign promote public awareness little impact volume ICD implant . Another group people suspect cardiologist pay enough attention patient ' candidacy ICD therapy tend focus patient ' ongoing symptom proactive prevention . Thus , active screen program may identify significant number patient benefit ICD therapy . However , comprehensive study evaluate impact active screening ICD implant volume , percentage eligible ICD patient without ICDs reason receive ICDs . Majority ICD implant United States currently perform community-based cardiology program . Thus proactive program identify ICD candidate community-based program may provide good assessment unrealized potential benefit ICDs primary prevention sudden cardiac death .</detailed_description>
