	<brief_summary>Unfortunately , investigator still need assess identify novel way help people quit smoke . Differences people term fast metabolize nicotine influence response transdermal nicotine patch , popular nicotine dependence treatment , affect plasma level nicotine treatment . These study suggest fast metabolizers nicotine may show good quit rate receive high dos transdermal nicotine . This preliminary study design assess , first time , whether fast nicotine metabolizers show high quit rate give high dose transdermal nicotine , versus standard dose . The study finding may help support subsequent large trial assess standard versus high dose transdermal nicotine slow versus fast metabolizers nicotine , may lead personalized approach treat nicotine dependence use nicotine patch improve therapeutic benefit transdermal nicotine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment High Dose Transdermal Nicotine Fast Metabolizers Nicotine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approach treat nicotine dependence remain priority . The transdermal nicotine patch widely use form tobacco dependence treatment , ~1 5 smoker use treatment achieve cessation . One factor may contribute poor response transdermal nicotine inter-individual variability rate nicotine metabolism , measure saliva ratio 3'hydroxycotinine ( 3-HC ) precursor cotinine . Two clinical trial transdermal nicotine show 3-HC/cotinine ratio predict response transdermal nicotine faster metabolizers nicotine ( high 3-HC/cotinine ratio ) low quit rate , vs. slow nicotine metabolizers . Among abstainer trial , 3-HC/cotinine ratio also predict therapeutic level nicotine transdermal nicotine , fast metabolizers nicotine exhibit low nicotine . Thus , fast metabolizers nicotine may require high nicotine dos achieve therapeutic benefit transdermal nicotine slow nicotine metabolizers . To date , clinical trial show , compare standard dose transdermal nicotine ( 21mg ) , high dos ( 42mg ) significant effect quit rate . However , trial high dose transdermal nicotine consider inter-individual variability rate nicotine metabolism . Thus , preliminary step toward conduct fully-powered , randomized clinical trial assess standard vs. high dose transdermal nicotine slow vs. fast metabolizers nicotine , propose evaluate , first time , efficacy high-dose transdermal nicotine ( vs. standard dose ) among fast metabolizers nicotine ( i.e. , upper quartile 3-HC/cotinine ratio distribution ) . We choose fast metabolizers nicotine trial since : 1 ) slow metabolizers nicotine exhibit high quit rate standard transdermal nicotine may experience adverse effect higher dos ; 2 ) `` proof concept '' R21 application , primary objective test whether high dos nicotine increase quit rate among fast metabolizers nicotine . Specifically , smoker fast metabolizers nicotine receive counseling randomize : 1 ) standard ( 1 X 21mg patch 1 X placebo patch ) , 2 ) high dose ( 2 x 21mg patch ) transdermal nicotine . The primary outcome biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence cessation 8 week treatment . Differences patch-related side effect mediator transdermal nicotine effect ( e.g. , nicotine level , withdrawal ) across study condition also assess . Ultimately , line research hop provide evidence necessary translate research 3-HC/cotinine ratio clinical practice treatment tobacco dependence . Specifically , research may show measure nicotine metabolism rate could use maximize therapeutic benefit transdermal nicotine provide slow metabolizers nicotine standard patch dose fast metabolizers nicotine high dose transdermal nicotine . Identifying effective treatment faster metabolizers nicotine also critical since individual increase risk lung cancer .</detailed_description>
