	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomized trial woman undergo HSG part infertility evaluation . At time scheduling , patient randomize either cervical vacuum cup , balloon catheter ( H/S catheter set , UA Medical , Biotech America ) , acorn-tipped cannula use stratify blocked randomization . 100 subject randomize one three cannula . Patients stratify 4 group representative four reproductive endocrinologist order overcome potential interoperator bias . Four reproductive endocrinologist perform HSG procedure standardized fashion . Fluoroscopy ensure proper location cannula check uterine filling contrast . Digital image document tubal filling spill contrast . The patient roll right left side confirm free spillage contrast peritoneal cavity . The last image take balloon tip deflate cannula remove best evaluate low uterine segment .</detailed_description>
