	<brief_summary>The current study involve novel aggressive therapeutic approach patient ' prostate cancer . In addition , investigator propose administer hormonal therapy patient especially high risk : initial Gleason score &gt; 6 , PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml , T3/T4 primary tumor , find node positive ( N+ ) . The use hormonal therapy specific setting correlate current standard care . IMRT well able spare protect normal tissue receive radiation 3-D conformal RT . The radiotherapy would follow continued hormonal therapy total 6 month one follow Gleason 7 PSA 10-20 per previous version trial , 1 year similar deliver EORTC high risk patient , ( initial Gleason score &gt; 8 , PSA &gt; 20 ng/ml , T3/T4 tumor ) . Those find N ( + ) would hormonal therapy continue indefinitely disease progression occur manner analogous Messing et . al . series prostatectomy patient . The goal develop administer program treatment include recent development image , integrate data CT scan ProstaScint scan optimize prostate cancer RT . The CT scan use stag determine exact location entire prostate receive reasonable dose RT . The ProstaScint use assess spread disease lymph node well determine exact location tumor within prostate gland . This region boost tumorcidal dose . The investigator plan monitor toxicity outcome treatment . The investigator expect program radioimmunoguided IMRT likely result similar less toxicity increase cure rate compare conventional radiotherapy standard IMRT program .</brief_summary>
