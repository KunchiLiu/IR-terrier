	<brief_title>Lymphedema After Surgery Patients With Endometrial Cancer , Cervical Cancer , Vulvar Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively estimate incidence low extremity lymphedema patient undergo radical surgery concurrent lymphadenectomy concurrent lymphadenectomy gynecologic malignancy . II . To identify risk factor development low extremity lymphedema follow radical surgery among patient one three type gynecologic malignancy study develop correspond predictive model . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify effect low extremity lymphedema quality life ( QOL ) ( measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - General [ FACT-G ] + disease specific subscale ) , psychological adjustment ( measure Impact Events Scale [ IES ] Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy [ FACIT ] body image item ) physical disability ( low extremity measure Lower Extremity Functional Scale [ LEFS ] ) physical function ( measure FACT-Functional Wellbeing [ FW ] subscale , FACIT disease specific item &amp; patient-reported outcome measurement information system [ PROMIS ] item ) investigate potential protective mechanism ( FACT-Social Wellbeing [ SW ] subscale patient characteristic ) . II . To explore patient self-reported symptom ( measure lymphedema [ LE ] Symptom Measure [ Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire ( GCLQ ) ] ) associate development lymphedema patient undergo radical surgery gynecologic malignancy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore effect moderate severe lymphedema ( primary endpoint ) QOL outcomes , measure FACT-General ( G ) questionnaire . OUTLINE : Patients vulvar cancer undergo radical vulvectomy hemi-vulvectomy follow immediately ipsilateral bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy . ( Closed accrual June 9 , 2014 ) Patients cervical cancer undergo radical hysterectomy trachelectomy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy +/- para-aortic nodal sample via vaginal , laparoscopic , open route . Patients endometrial cancer undergo laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy , total laparoscopic hysterectomy , total abdominal hysterectomy pelvic lymphadenectomy +/- para-aortic node sampling . Patients undergo limb measurement baseline , week 4-6 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients register three distinct grouping , group analyze separate study : Patients undergo undergone hysterectomy/bilateral salpingooophorectomy ( BSO ) pelvic lymphadenectomy +/ paraaortic node sample via open laparoscopic technique clinical stage III surgical stage IIII uterine carcinoma , include receive postoperative adjuvant therapy ; patient enrol surgery may pathologic stage IIII OR Patients undergo undergone radical hysterectomy trachelectomy pelvic lymphadenectomy +/ paraaortic node sample via open laparoscopic technique clinical stage IAIIA cervical carcinoma , include receive postoperative adjuvant therapy OR Patients vulvar cancer undergo undergone definitive surgery primary stage IIV vulvar cancer receive radical vulvectomy radical local excision concurrent unilateral bilateral inguinal inguinalfemoral lymphadenectomy ; patient go receive multimodality therapy ( radiation +/chemotherapy ) undergoing surgery eligible ; patient may undergo sentinel node map long follow full lymphadenectomy ; ( note : enrollment vulvar patient close June 9 , 2014 ; vulvar patient enrolled closure arm ) Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information Patients must serum albumin level &gt; = 3.0 within 14 day entry Surgery must occur within 5 business day study entry within eight week study entry Patients prior clinical history lower extremity lymphedema Patients history congestive heart failure , chronic renal disease , chronic liver disease Patients prior history chronic low extremity swell Patients Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) performance grade 3 4 Patients history invasive malignancy previous cancer treatment include surgical procedure Patients prior low extremity vascular surgery ( arterial venous ) Patients prior pelvic , abdominal , inguinal , low extremity radiation therapy Patients go receive another elective surgery operative event pelvic ( cervical uterine cancer ) inguinal ( vulvar ) lymphadenectomy Vulvar patient , June 9 , 2014 Patients enrol trial unless least one person participate site train perform limb measurement Patients undergo undergone lymphadenectomy portion procedure Patients enter study undergo sentinel node biopsy without intention undergo complete lymphadenectomy</criteria>
