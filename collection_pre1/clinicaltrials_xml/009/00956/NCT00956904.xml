	<brief_summary>A new solution guide surgeon robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALP ) image-guided navigation use transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) . A TRUS-guided intraoperative navigation system use robotic ultrasound probe manipulator ( TRUS Robot ) develop . The propose research pilot clinical trial TRUS Robot three-dimensional ( 3-D ) navigation software test image-guidance ability help surgeon RALP . This dual robot approach , Tandem-RALP ( T-RALP ) . The TRUS Robot allow steady hold well remote manipulation TRUS probe . In addition , TRUS Robot track accurate position TRUS probe allow 3-D reconstruction image . While intraoperative TRUS finding use surgical decision make trial , use TRUS image radical prostatectomy potentially improve visualization NVB subsequently improve postoperative recovery potency men . In addition , 3-D reconstruction image prostate gland potentially provide clear accurate guidance surgical landmark surgeon..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The preservation neurovascular bundle ( NVB ) include cavernous nerve radical prostatectomy improve postoperative recovery sexual potency . At present , location NVB determine surgeon 's visual estimation . However , NVB difficult visualize simple visual magnification surgical field surgical loupe laparoscopic lens due periprostatic connective tissue intraoperative hemorrhage . One approach well estimate location NVB identify macroscopic landmark clearly direct surgeon location NVB . The accompany artery vein NVB , visible Doppler ultrasound , serve macroscopic landmark localize microscopic cavernous nerve NVB . Therefore , use TRUS image radical prostatectomy potentially improve visualization NVB subsequently improve postoperative recovery potency men . In addition , 3-D shape prostate gland potentially clearly accurately delineated ultrasound image , provide direct guidance landmarks surgeon . Recently , intraoperative TRUS imaging use visualize prostate gland NVB laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP ) . The investigator report intraoperative use TRUS helpful image location local extent hypoechoic area ( ) , provide real-time guidance surgeon NVB release apical dissection prostate , monitoring calibrate , lobe-specific , wide dissection around cancer nodule suspect extracapsular extension ( ECE ) . With enhanced visualization surgical field TRUS imaging , report significant improvement NVB preservation decrease rate positive surgical margin , surrogate technical quality surgery . However , several aspect relate likely technology limitation improve . For example , TRUS probe manipulate human assistant LRP , compromise image stability especially Doppler imaging , discard pose image , perform navigation base recommendation assistant rather use actual navigation software . Moreover , application TRUS use non-robotic LRP , daVinci® robot use RALP occupy place human assistant end operative table . Finally , objective measure quantify performance navigational aid . Regardless study 's shortcoming , author report positive surgical margin rate decrease precipitously since use TRUS guidance , demonstrate potential benefit TRUS-based guidance surgery . Since study , use intraoperative TRUS guidance prostate surgery gain wide acceptance , , fact , criticize require additional personnel expertise TRUS . Alternatively , propose use TRUS Robot , robotic arm hold manipulate TRUS probe remotely , allow surgeon manipulate TRUS probe without need human assistant RALP . We also propose use 3-D TRUS navigation image obtain TRUS .</detailed_description>
