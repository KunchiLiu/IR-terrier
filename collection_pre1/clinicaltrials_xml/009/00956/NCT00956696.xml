At visit seizure control adverse event assess . Behaviour assess use SIB-R ( Chinese version ) baseline study visit . At end study period patient 's overall improvement rat investigator caregiver use global evaluation scale . Patients improvement maintain TPM end study period Titration schedule Topiramate administer orally per usual clinical practice . Treatment initiate 25 mg daily 1 week , increase 25- 50-mg increment one- two-weekly interval , initial target dose 100 - 200 mg daily 2 divide dos accord individual 's response .
