	<brief_summary>Currently two-stage tissue expander/implant ( TE/I ) technique standard breast reconstructive option breast cancer patient select immediate , skin-sparing mastectomy . This procedure demonstrate oncologically safe patient specific criterion early stage breast cancer . The primary drawback , however , require two separate procedure general anesthesia multiple office visit expander inflation create breast mound . Acellular dermal matrix gain widespread acceptance use breast reconstruction area potential provide support breast implant without tissue expansion one-stage procedure . The purpose study test new procedure evaluate impact one-stage breast reconstruction use acellular dermis compare standard two-stage expander/implant technique measure patient satisfaction quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One-stage Breast Reconstruction Using Dermal Matrix/Implant Versus Two-stage Expander/Implant Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , significant focus performance skin-sparing mastectomy certain type breast cancer patient . These treatment may perform prophylactic mastectomy also demonstrate oncologically safe patient specific criterion early stage breast cancer . Currently , two-stage tissue expander/implant ( TE/I ) technique standard breast reconstructive option breast cancer patient select immediate , skin-sparing mastectomy , however significant disadvantage technique require two separate surgery multiple office visit complete may affect patient quality life . Medically safe compound acellular dermal matrix develop potential support breast implant without require numerous tissue expansion consequently provide potential one-stage breast implant/reconstruction procedure immediate , skin-sparing mastectomy . To examine patient satisfaction , quality life overall aesthetic outcome achieve use acellular dermal matrix facilitate one-staged breast reconstruction 2 week , 6 &amp; 12 month follow completion reconstruction . Hypothesis 2 : Patient satisfaction , quality life overall aesthetic outcome achieve use acellular dermal matrix facilitate one-stage breast reconstruction superior follow standard two-stage tissue expander/ implant breast reconstruction technique select mastectomy patient . To determine short long-term operative complication rate associate use dermal matrix one-stage immediate breast reconstruction follow skin-sparing mastectomy . Hypothesis 1 : The use acellular dermal matrix one-stage immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction associate decreased short long-term postoperative complication compare traditional two stag tissue expander/implant procedure .</detailed_description>
