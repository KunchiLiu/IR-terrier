	<brief_summary>Lung cancer remain top cancer killer Hong Kong . Even early resectable stage lung cancer , around 60-70 % patient survive 5 year operation , mostly related disease recurrence . Therefore urgent need predictive biomarkers potentially help monitor patient risk disease recurrence operation . Recent study suggest important role oxidative stress development lung cancer preliminary data suggest oxidative stress marker blood could predictive response systemic chemotherapy lung cancer . Apart potential biomarkers blood , ongoing study also conduct investigate predictive role biomarkers exhale breath condensate lung cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . Exhaled breath condensate collect simply disposable commercially available device allow trap breath condensate via cool column normal breathe 20 minute . Therefore study aim investigate role blood exhale breath condensate oxidative stress biomarkers surgical lung resection lung cancer predict subsequent clinical outcome , i.e. , time disease recurrence . Recruited subject undergo interval sample blood exhale breath condensate , without additional invasive intervention . The study subject follow 5 year subsequent disease recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer major cause cancer death among gender Hong Kong . In 2005 , primary lung cancer account 33 % 25 % cancer death men woman respectively . On average , around 4,000 new case lung cancer year . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 80 % primary lung cancer . About 60 % case present advanced stage IIIB IV disease . The currently available treatment modality include surgery , radiotherapy systemic chemotherapy . However , overall prognosis remain dismal 5-year survival rate le 15 % . Among early stage lung cancer , 5-year survival rate still suboptimal around 60-70 % . Therefore , immense interest development novel biomarkers delineate high risk group subsequent tumour recurrence curative lung resection . It long find cellular prooxidant state promote cell neoplastic growth , part due DNA damage cause reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , i.e . superoxide anion hydroxyl radical . The potential therapeutic role antioxidant chemoprevention lung cancer therefore bring major clinical trial recent year . Disappointingly , major landmark chemoprevention trial include Alpha-Tocopherol , Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention ( ATBC ) study Beta-Carotene Retinol Efficacy Trial ( CARET ) fail demonstrate therapeutic benefit vitamins A E lung cancer . Apart criticism dosage use trial , result may reflect lack understanding exact role antioxidant lung carcinogenesis . The simple use general antioxidant , vitamins A E , may able target specifically peculiar alteration antioxidant profile lead development lung cancer . In fact , recent study demonstrate specific change antioxidant expression surgically resect non-small cell lung cancer . In resected lung cancer tissue , increase manganese superoxide dismutase ( Mn SOD ) decrease catalase expression transcriptional level compare adjacent normal lung tissue . It hypothesize alteration local antioxidant level may result anti-apoptosis accumulation genetic damage thus perpetuate carcinogenesis . However exact clinical implication still investigation . Our previous case-control study systemic ( erythrocyte ) antioxidant activity patient NSCLC show increase glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , decrease SOD activity compare healthy control . The erythrocyte SOD activity associate disease stag . In addition , recent study longitudinal profile erythrocyte antioxidant chemotherapy advanced NSCLC identify total glutathione independent predictor treatment response , may reflect tumour load ( submit , unpublished data ) . Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) recently emerge non-invasive sample method real-time analysis evaluation oxidative stress biomarkers low respiratory tract airway , especially various lung disease include asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer . In particular , endothelin-1 interleukin-6 find elevated EBC patient lung cancer . Therefore , current study aim evaluate temporal change various oxidative stress biomarkers cytokines EBC blood patient NSCLC undergo surgical lung resection potential role parameter predict subsequent tumour recurrence . Also , correlation biomarkers blood EBC lung tumour tissue look .</detailed_description>
