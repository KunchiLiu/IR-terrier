	<brief_title>Does Deflating Tracheal Cuff Shorten Weaning Time ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial . Study protocol : patient eligible study fulfil standard criterion wean initiation stratify risk aspiration ( drink test ) two category : - Low/moderate risk patient ( see later ) . - High risk patient ( spontaneous aspiration pharyngeal secretion ) , exclude study . After evaluation patient randomize ( concealed allocation ) stratify tracheostomy indication . Weaning Decannulation Protocol : Attempts discontinue mechanical ventilation ( MV ) initiate tracheostomized patient fulfill criterion ( recovery precipitate illness ; respiratory criterion consist PaO2/fraction inspire oxygen ratio &gt; 150 mm Hg positive end-expiratory pressure &lt; 8 cm H2O , arterial pH &gt; 7.32 ; clinical criterion consist absence myocardial ischemia determine ECG , need vasoactive drug dopamine ≤5 µg/kg/min , heart rate &lt; 140 beats/min , haemoglobin concentration &gt; 8 g/dL , temperature &lt; 38°C , need sedative drug , presence respiratory stimulus spontaneous cough deem clinically appropriate . Patients screen daily criterion ) . A clinical algorithm progressive wean mechanical ventilation follow discretion attend physician . Patients wean follow one two method : progressive withdrawal pressure support ventilation T-tube trial . When patient tolerate spontaneous breathe 12 hour two consecutive day , remain connected T-tube continuously . When patient remain disconnected mechanical ventilation least 24 hour , investigator assess preparedness decannulation . The investigator perform tracheostomy tube occlusion test exclude tracheal obstruction airflow . At point , attend physician clinically evaluate patient 's capacity clear respiratory secretion mainly base frequency need suction characteristic respiratory secretion . The nurse suction subglottic secretion deflate cuff avoid risk aspiration . Criteria decannulation : respiratory secretion management consider adequate ( &lt; 2 aspiration every 8 hour ) low risk aspiration . End-points : - Weaning time : start day first disconnection ( last &lt; 30 minute ) end day patient liberate mechanical ventilation ( patient consider wean 24 consecutive hour disconnect mechanical ventilation ) . - Tracheobronchitis pneumonia randomization . Safety consideration : The main safety concern risk aspiration . First patient categorize three step use drink test : low risk patient ( normal drink test ) specific intervention ; moderate risk ( abnormal drink test ) risk aspiration study include videolaryngoscopy ; high risk patient exclude study . In patient high flow-humidified oxygen-air mixture system connect trough external cannula .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : tracheostomized patient follow reason : Prolonged time mechanical ventilation ( &gt; 21 day ) prolong wean . Motor component Glasgow Coma Score &lt; 6 point inability adequate manage airway ( &gt; 2 aspiration every 8 hour ) . High risk aspiration ( neuromuscular disease affect bulbar function , tracheostomy indicate part surgical procedure involve upper airway high risk aspiration observe specific evaluation previous randomization ) . Death start wean attempt .</criteria>
