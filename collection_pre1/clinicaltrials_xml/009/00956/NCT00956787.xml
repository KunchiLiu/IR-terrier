	<brief_title>Study AR-67 ( DB-67 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management MDS , recently , base mostly supportive care . This include transfusion support , hematopoietic growth factor , management complication . With management , disease would run natural course patient eventually die either progression acute leukemia complication associate MDS ( e.g. , infection , hemorrhage ) . Recently , hypomethylating agent offer promise management patient MDS . Although agent show efficacy subset patient , responses usually either partial hematologic improvement , CR rate &lt; 10 % . In addition , responses median duration le 12 month . Thus , although agent improved outcome patient MDS approve FDA purpose , clearly need additional effective agent disease . In vitro data suggest topoisomerase I inhibitor could activity MDS , prolong exposure appear particularly effective . Topotecan first agent class explore purpose . A phase I study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 2 mg/m2/day continuous infusion 5 day . Using dose , phase II study patient MDS CMML , complete remission rate 31 % achieve . These agent consider effective available date treatment MDS constitute standard therapy . Because different time study conduct different eligibility criterion use ( e.g. , patient secondary MDS eligible decitabine , patient high-risk MDS eligible topotecan ) , comparison somehow limited . However , result topotecan compare favorably obtain 5-azacytidine decitabine . The CR rate high achieve agent . Response duration shorter report AZA , remission duration AZA include hematologic improvement constitute response AZA . In addition , AZA study continue therapy response lose , topotecan study ( well decitabine study ) administer design 4-6 cycle therapy . Survival shorter patient treat topotecan , unexpected consider population include 50 % patient CMML 32 % secondary MDS , important adverse prognostic characteristic MDS . The AZA study best survival , include 37 % patient RA RAES 20 % intermediate-2 high IPSS . Because eligibility include patient great 10 % blast , MDS patient would score least 1.5 thus classified intermediate-2 risk group . Based favorable activity topotecan single agent , topotecan also use combination cytarabine high-risk MDS ( i.e. , RAEB &gt; 10 % blast RAEBt ) . A CR rate 56 % achieve , low rate induction mortality ( 7 % ) population median age 68 year . These result least equivalent achieve idarubicin cytarabine combination retrospective comparison two different trial , prospective randomize trial . Overall , result suggest additional exploration topoisomerase I inhibitors myelodysplastic syndrome warrant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients either follow diagnosis : MDS &gt; 5 % blast , IPSS risk group intermediate1 , intermediate2 high risk Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) 2 . Patients must fail prior therapy either hypomethylating agent ( e.g. , azacytidine , decitabine ) alone combination agent . Patients abnormalities chromosome 5q , fail either hypomethylating agent lenalidomide . Patients intolerant unable receive agent consider eligible . 3 . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AR67 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . 4 . ECOG performance status 02 . 5 . Patients must normal organ function define : Total bilirubin : &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) : &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine : &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal 6 . The effect AR67 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal least 12 month surgically sterile ) men must agree use effective method contraception . Women childbearing potential ( woman surgically sterile &gt; 2 year post menopause ) must give consent use reliable method contraception ( e.g . doublebarrier , tubal ligation stable hormonal contraception ) throughout duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 8 . Patients must chemotherapy 2 week prior enter study unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy grade â‰¤1 . The use hydroxyurea allow control count 24 hr prior start therapy AR67 . 1 . Nursing pregnant female female plan pregnancy duration study . 2 . Active uncontrolled systemic infection . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
