	<brief_title>Neurophysiologic Predictors Outcome With rTMS Treatment Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A critical challenge management major depressive disorder ( MDD ) selection treatment individual patient . Although treatment depression restore people 's life , treatment modality individual achieve complete remission symptom , whether intervention pharmacological , psychological , somatic . While predictor treatment propose group patient , translation predictor individualize patient care remain elusive . In analysis data NCT 00104611 multi-site , randomize , sham-controlled trial TMS , find large number prior treatment failure , long duration current episode , presence comorbid anxiety individual patient characteristic associate poor acute outcome TMS treatment randomized period ( Lisanby et al. , press ) . This publication report standard predictor metric ( e.g. , sensitivity , specificity , positive- negative-predictive accuracy , ROC curve ) , difficult ass value clinical factor treatment plan individual patient . A predictor could distinguish individual likely remit TMS versus likely need different intervention would great use clinicians patient make treatment decision . Our prior work ( Cook et al. , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 ; Leuchter et al . 2002 ) study new physiologic biomarker response SSRI mixed-action antidepressant . The EEG-based cordance biomarker detect physiologic effect successful antidepressant treatment 48 hour , 1 week , 2 week treatment ; contrast , symptom difference responder non-responders separate 4 week treatment placebo-controlled trial . Additionally , magnitude early physiologic change associate completeness clinical response . Our biomarker independently study finding replicate ( Kopecek et al. , 2006 ; Bareš et al. , 2007 , 2008 ) . The cordance biomarker consider leading indicator predictor treatment outcome . As non-invasive probe brain physiology , may detect early neurophysiologic change associate accelerate clinical response TMS . More recent work relate EEG-based measure , Antidepressant Treatment Response Index ( ATR ) lead simplify monitoring system ; physician record clinically-useful data 15-minute in-office procedure electrode locate forehead ear ( Leuchter et al. , submission ) . The ATR use physiologic data collect prior treatment one week exposure , show predictive outcome antidepressant medication . We able assess cordance ATR measure EEG measurement make prior treatment 5 treatment session TMS evaluate predictive property metric . On related issue , variation outcome may relate treatment factor . Quantitative model direct vivo measurement ( Wagner et al , 2004 , 2008 ) indicate electrical current induce TMS predominantly confine brain region directly treatment coil . The procedure position coil cortical target describe NeuroStar TMS System User Manual ( volume 2 , section 6 7 ) involve first determine location stimulation lead contraction abductor policis brevis muscle ( visualized thumb twitch right hand ) positioning coil 5.5 cm anterior position along left Superior Oblique Angle line . While target locate good reproducibility associate therapeutic outcome NCT trial , clear position coil best target within DLPFC patient . Indeed , individual difference gyral anatomy gross brain size add variability specific neuroanatomic region stimulate , may impact treatment efficiency . Exposure even brief train TMS pulse elicit acute physiologic change ( cf Siebner Rothwell , 2003 ) , test procedure perform assess distance standard treatment position point elicit maximal acute physiologic response . We propose 9-locus mapping procedure , involve assessment change brain activity stimulation location include around standard treatment target . The nine location usual treatment location 8 point , 1.5 3.0 cm anterior , posterior , rostral , caudal primary target . Test stimulation 15 second ( =150 pulse @ 10 Hz ) location , follow 5 minute continuous EEG record examine acute change regional brain activity response brief stimulation exposure . All therapeutic stimulation take place standard location , able evaluate proportion variance clinical outcome explain distance location maximal acute physiologic response . Based previous study , propose ass patient treatment TMS , use clinical symptom rating brain physiology EEG .</detailed_description>
