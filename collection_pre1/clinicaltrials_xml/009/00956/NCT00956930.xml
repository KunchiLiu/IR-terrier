	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep chemotherapy drug near tumor . Radioembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep radioactive substance near tumor . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat patient liver cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study radioembolization see well work compare chemoembolization treat patient liver cancer treat Radiofrequency Ablation remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization Versus Radioembolization Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Treated With Radiofrequency Ablation Or Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare contrast TACE Y90 order determine either equivalence superiority measure time-to-progression . Secondary - Characterize safety toxicity profile regimen . - Determine need subsequent treatment patient . - Determine tumor response patient - Characterize change quality life functional status patient . - Determine time progression patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize receive either TACE Y90 - Arm I ( radioembolization ) : Patients undergo radioembolization yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres hepatic artery infusion approximately 1-3 course . - Arm II ( transarterial chemoembolization [ TACE ] ) : Patients undergo TACE mitomycin C , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cisplatin hepatic artery infusion approximately 1-3 course . - In arm , treatment modification may apply accord response . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>

Lesions &lt; 1 cm diameter low likelihood malignant follow . Lack growth 12 year suggest HCC . AFP &gt; 200 radiological evidence ( arterial hypervascularity ) lesion &gt; 2 cm require biopsy . Two image modality ( triphasic CT , MRI , ultrasound , angiography ) demonstrate `` arterial hypervascularity '' background cirrhosis require biopsy One imaging modality lesion arterial hypervascularity wash early delay venous phase , require biopsy Atypical appearance image require biopsy . Nonconclusive biopsy require close monitoring For noncirrhotics ( biopsy image finding ) , diagnosis HCC require biopsy Patients &lt; 50 % liver involvement Measurable liver confine disease bidimensional measurement , require within 4 week screen . Lesions report image `` small characterize '' , abdominal lymph node &lt; 2.0 cm ascites set cirrhosis consider metastatic disease unless cytology proven . No segmental , lobar main portal vein thrombosis evidence cross sectional imaging Prior resection permit , prior systemic , ablative infusion therapy permit Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 [ appendix B ] Childs score A B [ appendix C ] Required lab parameter within 28 day screen Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl ( unless segmental infusion perform AST ALT ≤ 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN Prothrombin time ( PT ) / International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 2.3 PT ≤ 6 second control .
