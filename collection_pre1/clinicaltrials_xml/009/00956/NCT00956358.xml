	<brief_summary>Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) become major life-saving treatment many haematological condition , mostly malignancy . However , lot potential complication hinder long-term success HSCT , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) one serious complication . Basically , BOS represent form graft-versus-host immunological damage small airway ( bronchiole ) , lead progressive narrow small airway thus obstructive lung function abnormality . With progressive loss lung function BOS , patient HSCT complicate intractable respiratory failure result mortality . Up , still reliable way accurately predict detect BOS early allow pharmacological intervention . Therefore intense interest search biomarkers help predict occurrence BOS HSCT . Apart biomarkers ( e.g. , cytokine ) blood , recent development sample airway line fluid non-invasive method , i.e. , collection exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) . In airway disease asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , EBC find various cytokine serve potential biomarkers disease activity . Since BOS largely small airway disease , become logical investigate profile biomarkers EBC predictor BOS HSCT . Therefore study design look role biomarkers blood EBC early detection BOS HSCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) revolutionize treatment haematological perhaps solid malignancy . However , despite recent technological advancement , HSCT still associate significant mortality morbidity . Apart various infective complication early stage post-HSCT , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) well-known late complication result high mortality . It mostly associate develop chronic graft-versus-host disease allogeneic HSCT . Clinically , diagnosis BOS largely base demonstration obstructive lung function abnormalities air-trapping computed tomography scan thorax . Pathologically , bronchiolitis obliterans characterize inflammatory fibrotic reaction small bronchiole lead subsequent obliteration . Upon diagnosis BOS post-HSCT , inhale corticosteroid ( without bronchodilator ) commonly prescribe anti-inflammatory agent , though undocumented clinical efficacy . Unfortunately , still lack reliable biomarkers predict allow early detection BOS , preferably early potentially reversible stage development BOS . Apart measure circulate biomarkers blood , exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) recently emerge non-invasive sample method real-time analysis evaluation oxidative stress biomarkers low respiratory tract airway , especially various lung disease include asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer . As bronchiolitis obliterans predominantly disease small bronchiole , highly likely associate change various inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers EBC . However , role measure EBC biomarkers predict occurrence BOS HSCT study . Therefore , current study aim evaluate temporal change various oxidative stress biomarkers cytokines EBC blood patient haematological condition undergo allogeneic HSCT , regard subsequent development BOS .</detailed_description>
