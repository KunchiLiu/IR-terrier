	<brief_summary>Chronic suppurative otitis medium ( CSOM ) particularly difficult treat number patient respond routine antibiotic surgical treatment . The current treatment involve administer combination antibiotic anti-inflammatory ear drop Ciprodex ( ciprofloxacin 0.3 % / dexamethasone 0.1 % ) . Although patient experience relief symptom , fraction patient remain refractory treatment . Recent finding suggest addition N-acetylcysteine ( 0.5-2 % ) Ciprodex superior treatment otitis medium effusion compare use Ciprodex alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic suppurative otitis medium ( CSOM ) presence symptom , sign , physical finding result long-term damage middle ear result infection inflammation . The condition define chronic drainage ear , last long 12 week , perforate tympanic membrane . Although pathogenesis may result action inflammatory mediator cytokine release follow infection , recent evidence also suggest biofilm formation may responsible sustain inflammatory response promote persistent effusion ( 1 ) . These patient present challenge otolaryngologist number respond typical oral topical antibiotic . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) antioxidant commonly use treatment acetaminophen overdose , well document mucolytic property . In vitro , NAC show significantly inhibit formation bacterial biofilms use alone enhance antimicrobial effect drug ciprofloxacin ( 3 ) , fosfomycin tigecycline use combination ( 4-6 ) . The application NAC middle ear patient tympanostomy tubes show increase tube longevity , decrease replacement tube , recurrence infection , tympanosclerosis , subsequent physician visit ( 7 ) . Recent finding case series suggest addition N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Ciprodex otic solution superior treatment chronic otitis medium compare Ciprodex alone ( 3 ) . Although practice supplement Ciprodex otic solution , standard pharmacologic treatment otitis medium , NAC order treat patient difficult infection hold therapeutic promise , efficacy treatment objectively assess control study date patient population adequate size . The purpose study assess efficacy Ciprodex augment NAC compare Ciprodex alone blind study subject therapy chronically drain ear ineffective . Hypothesis : The cessation otorrhea expect achieve great number subject otorrhea treat Ciprodex otic solution supplement NAC compare Ciprodex alone . We expect patient treated Ciprodex augment NAC experience earlier cessation symptom longer duration complete response follow treatment . Justification : The current pharmacologic treatment CSOM involve combination antibiotic anti-inflammatory otic drop . Ciprodex ( ciprofloxacin 0.3 % / dexamethasone 0.1 % ) show safe effective child adult ear infection . Although patient experience relief symptom , clinical data various study show 10-15 % patient respond treatment ( 2 ) . Recent finding suggest addition N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Ciprodex otic solution superior treatment chronic otitis medium compare Ciprodex alone ( 3 ) . Objectives : The specific aim project compare effect Ciprodex otic solution alone use Ciprodex augment 1.25 % NAC randomize double-blind trial . Research Method : Patients experience least 1 month continuous daily otorrhea despite treatment recruit tertiary otology/neurotology clinic . Patient information , include previous failed intervention , duration otorrhea , baseline audiometry , exist medical condition document prior initiating treatment . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment group instruct administer 3 drop three time daily affect ear 14 day . One group use standard Ciprodex solution ; second group use Ciprodex 0.5mL 20 % NAC add 7.5mL bottle ( final concentration 1.25 % ) Follow-up visit schedule 2 week interval , patient undergo audiometry re-assessment treatment progress monitor history binocular microscopy . Compliance treatment confirm follow-up visit patient provide fresh otic solution 14 day discharge persists , maximum duration therapy 8 week . During period patient assess every 2 week , currently standard treatment . Potential adverse reaction otalgia , tinnitus , ear fullness , vertigo also document visit . After maximum 8 week treatment , patient continue experience otorrhea undergo alternative treatment regimen may include oral topical antibiotic , surgery . Patients successfully treat monitor 4 6 month ass whether complete durable cessation otorrhea achieve . Randomization drug perform hospital site pharmacist prior dispense solution subject . Random number list generate randomization perform block 4 St. Paul 's Hospital Pharmacy . The Principle Investigator access database emergency situation arise . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis include two-tailed paired Student 's test perform compare treatment duration require patient experience cessation otorrhea two treatment group . Thirty patient ( 15 per treatment group ) expect recruited study .</detailed_description>
