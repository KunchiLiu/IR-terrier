	<brief_summary>Background : - Tumors depend blood vessel provide nourishment allows grow . - Thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor among tumor contain blood vessel . Thus , endocrine tumor important study new blood vessel formation tumor . Objectives : -To obtain tissue endocrine tumor examination determine differ normal tissue . Eligibility : -Patients schedule surgery remove endocrine tumor , around thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland , pancreas , neuroendocrine tissue . Design : - Tissues obtain patient surgery remove thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , neuroendocrine tumor . - About 400 patient enrol study period 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Blood Vessel Formation Endocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Endocrine neoplasm among fast grow tumor incidence United States . Between 1995 2005 , incidence thyroid carcinoma increase 98 percent . - Tumors thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor among highly vascularize tumor see . - Consequently , endocrine neoplasms provide extremely important model study tumor angiogenesis . - The Tumor Angiogenesis Section Surgery Branch , NCI focus study neovascular formation neoplastic tissue . In addition , section primary responsibility provide endocrine surgery consultative service NIH . As , Section uniquely position acquire perform important study endocrine tissue help advance knowledge mechanism involve tumor vessel development . The majority patient enrol study patient protocols throughout NIH , Section consult order perform surgery . Objectives : Primary Objective : -To develop class predictor model base gene expression pattern distinguish benign neoplastic endocrine tissue endocrine histology study . This objective drive statistical endpoint study . Secondary Objectives : - To utilize tissue obtain endocrine neoplasms study gene expression change , proteomic change , methylation change . - To perform histologic examination tissue include immunohistochemistry situ hybridization order study change tumor neovessel formation . - To obtain , accessible , adjacent normal endocrine tissue comparison neoplastic tissue . - To collect tissue endocrine neoplasms arise thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , extraadrenal neuroendocrine rest future analysis correlation clinical outcome . Eligibility : - Patients radiographic evidence , biochemical evidence , histologically/cytologically proven , endocrine neoplasm , include lesion thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , extra-adrenal endocrine rest , paragangliomas , neuroblastomas pancreas . - Patients must ECOG performance score 0-2 . - Patients must laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior biopsy surgery . Design : - A tissue acquisition trial tissue obtain time surgical operation removal neoplasms thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , paragangliomas extraadrenal rest neuroendocrine tissue . - Tissue process time collection , store ship PI 's laboratory processing . - No investigational therapy give . - It anticipate 400 patient enrolled period 5 year .</detailed_description>
