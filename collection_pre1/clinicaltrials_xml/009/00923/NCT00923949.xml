	<brief_summary>Background : - Pioglitazone drug belongs class antidiabetic agent call thiazolidinediones . It approve treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . - Research suggest thiazolidinediones may anticancer activity reduce cancer risk cause tumor shrink . Objectives : -To test pioglitazone work treatment Stage IA IIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) look effect drug cancer cell . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old undergo surgery Stage IA IIB non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Design : -The study include screen visit determine eligibility , treatment pioglitazone , follow-up visit 2 3 week treatment post-surgery visit . Procedures include : 1 . Medical history , physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram 2 . Bronchoscopy obtain cancer cell . This do pioglitazone treatment begin lung surgery . Some patient may also require mediastinoscopy biopsy collect cell . 3 . Treatment pioglitazone tablet day least 2 week 6 week , depend surgery schedule . 4 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan start pioglitazone treatment . National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) patient also follow-up PET scan treatment surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Treat Adults Undergoing Surgery Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States ( US ) . Chemoprevention active area investigation reduce burden disease . However , choice chemopreventive target require sufficient human data justify extensive clinical intervention . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR gamma ) ligand activate nuclear transcription factor key regulator adipogenic differentiation . PPAR gamma ligand , particularly thiazolidinedione class antidiabetic agent exemplify pioglitazone , investigation chemopreventive agent . PPAR gamma express normal lung NSCLC . PPAR gamma ligand induce apoptosis NSCLC cell line modulate differentiation status . Animal carcinogenesis study , however , show equivocal efficacy prevention lung cancer . Relevant human data limit epidemiologic study show lung cancer risk decrease diabetic take thiazolidinediones small phase IIa trial pioglitazone oral leukoplakia show 80 % clinical response ( partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) ) . Further data need prior engage phase II lung chemoprevention trial . Objectives : The objective pilot feasibility study evaluate effect pioglitazone expression multiple biomarkers NSCLC tumor tissue histologically normal premalignant tissue . - The primary endpoint effect pioglitazone Ki-67 , marker proliferation , tumor tissue . - The secondary objective determine effect pioglitazone multiple biomarkers tumor , premalignant , histologically normal bronchial epithelium serum : - Tumor tissue biomarkers : apoptotic index ( AI ) , cyclin D1 , p21/Waf1 , PPAR gamma , mucin 1 ( MUC1 ) , gelsolin , proline oxidase , 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( 15-PGDH ) - Premalignant tissue biomarkers : Ki-67 , apoptotic index , PPAR gamma - Histologically normal tissue biomarkers : Ki-67 , PPAR gamma - Serum marker affect pioglitazone ; C-reactive protein , CA 15-3 - Serum tumor marker : carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125 ) - Additional secondary objective : - To evaluate toxicity safety pioglitazone patient population , - To determine limited treatment pioglitazone affect tumor metabolic activity determine fludeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) . Eligibility : Adult patient newly diagnose histologically confirm stage Ia-IIb resectable non-small cell lung cancer eligible schedule undergo definitive surgery . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0-2 Normal organ function Design : Open label , multi-center , non-randomized pilot study evaluate effect pioglitazone expression multiple biomarkers NSCLC tumor tissue histologically normal premalignant tissue obtain treatment-naive individual receive oral pioglitazone prior definitive surgery . The primary endpoint Ki-67 measure tumor tissue . Patients receive pioglitazone 45 mg po qd minimum 2 week maximum 6 week , duration treatment determine standard care schedule surgery . The study consist screen visit , baseline bronchoscopy tissue acquisition , pioglitazone treatment 2-6 week , 2-week on-treatment clinic visit , definitive surgical resection bronchoscopy perform time resection , post-surgery visit . Tissue ( visually normal abnormal area identify bronchoscopy ) tumor obtain baseline time surgery . Patients receive treatment NCI also undergo follow FDG-PET scan minimum 2 week pioglitazone treatment . Up 25 patient expect enrol identify 20 patient adequate tissue biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
