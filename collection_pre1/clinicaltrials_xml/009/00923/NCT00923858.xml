	<brief_summary>The purpose project provide information help u understand happens time rotator cuff tear . In study , investigator follow population people rotator cuff tear hurt ( asymptomatic ) establish probability asymptomatic rotator cuff tear , identify context contralateral symptom , become symptomatic time . To determine ultrasound probability rotator cuff tear enlarge time . To determine symptom progression correlate enlargement rotator cuff tear and/or degenerative change radiographs . In order obtain data , study subject recall follow-up 1 year time point 5 year period . The study subject repeat physical exam , ultrasound radiographic examination . A control group normal patient also follow comparison .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Asymptomatic Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : 1 . To determine probability asymptomatic rotator cuff tear become symptomatic time . 2 . To determine epidemiological factor correlate symptomatic progression . 3 . To determine symptomatic progression correlate enlargement rotator cuff tear determine sonography . 4 . To determine value routine sonographic scan asymptomatic shoulder .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Group 1 ( Cohorts I &amp; II ) Inclusion : Participants enrol age 65 year young remain study . Less 11 annual visit nonoperative surveillance study shoulder . Less 3 annual visit follow rotator cuff repair study shoulder . Group 1 ( Cohorts I &amp; II ) Exclusion : Workman 's Compensation claim involve shoulder . Use crutch , cane weightbearing device study shoulder . Moderate severe glenohumeral arthritis . Inflammatory disease process affect neurological/musculoskeletal system may impact weightbearing activity normal use upper body . Inability return routine study visit . Traumatic injury rotator cuff . Rotator Cuff Tear great 30mm width . Advanced fatty muscle degeneration . Patients currently enrol require shoulder replacement remain study . Cohorts I &amp; II consider control group comparison enrol next recruitment period . Group 2 ( Cohort III ) Inclusion : Age 65 year younger . Surgical candidate primary , doublerow repair rotator . Able comply post operative therapy protocol . Bilateral partial full thickness rotator cuff tear : one symptomatic require surgery contralateral shoulder asymptomatic . Group 2 ( Cohort III ) Exclusion : Workman 's Compensation claim involve shoulder . Use crutch , cane weightbearing device study shoulder . Moderate severe glenohumeral arthritis . Inflammatory disease process affect neurological/musculoskeletal system may impact weightbearing activity normal use upper body . Inability return routine study visit .
