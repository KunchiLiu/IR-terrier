	<brief_summary>Background : - Fungal infection lung ( pneumonia ) cause mold , Aspergillus Zygomycetes , cause often difficult doctor diagnose . Early accurate diagnosis infection help doctor select correct medicine proper treatment . - A number method use diagnose fungal pneumonia . Ones commonly use clinical practice include radiographic imaging ( chest X-rays compute tomography ( CT ) scan ) , blood test , culture take fluid lung ( broncho-alveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid ) . Other new method may improve diagnosis fungal pneumonia . These method include test detect DNA fungal germ blood BAL fluid patient infection . Objectives : - To help develop good accurate method diagnose fungal lung infection . - To detect fungal DNA chemical bloodstream BAL fluid immunocompromised patient pneumonia . Eligibility : - Immunocompromised patient currently enrol another NIH protocol CT scan show possible fungal infection lung . Design : - Researchers review patient ' exist medical record CT scan , current pneumonia treatment plan . - Patients provide blood BAL sample duration treatment pneumonia , require researcher . Additional CT scan perform , except part exist treatment plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Invasive fungal infection important cause infectious disease , morbidity mortality immunocompromised patient cancer , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , aplastic anemia , autoimmune disease , primary immune deficiency . Foremost among lethal infection invasive pulmonary aspergillosis zygomycosis . Early detection infection allow timely initiation specific antifungal therapy , may life save . However , early diagnosis respiratory fungal infection difficult , often leading delay therapy inaccurate treatment . The Immunocompromised Host Section develop series sensitive highly specific PCR assay detection life-threatening infection . We also characterize expression cell wall derive biomarkers , ( 1-3 ) -Beta-D-glucan galactomannan vitro vivo . Laboratory animal study indicate assay may complement current diagnostic modality allow accurate earlier detection invasive pulmonary fungal infection immunocompromised patient . Objectives : The primary objective study improve early diagnosis invasive pulmonary aspergillosis invasive pulmonary zygomycosis immunocompromised patient addition molecular biomarker detection methodology standard diagnostic system use clinical microbiology laboratory . The secondary objective : A . To compare diagnostic yield analytical performance PCR , galactomannan ( 1-3 ) -Beta-D-glucan standard diagnostic system . B . To evaluate effect different independent variable expression aforementioned assay C. To characterize variable may contribute therapeutic outcome ( global response ; survival ) D. To characterize use biomarkers context EORTC/MSG definition E. To identify genetic marker may predispose patient invasive fungal pulmonary infection . Eligibility : Immunocompromised patient currently enrol NIH IRB approve Clinical Center protocol evaluation and/or treatment his/her primary disease , patient receive treatment Children 's National Medical Center ( CNMC ) develop pulmonary infiltrate radiologically compatible invasive pulmonary aspergillosis invasive pulmonary zygomycosis , EORTC/MSG criterion . Design : This multi-center , prospective diagnostic interventional study . Patients refer Clinical Center evaluation treatment primary research protocol eligible enrollment protocol Clinical Center . Patients meet eligibility criterion may also enrol CNMC . Patients compatible radiologic sign risk development invasive pulmonary aspergillosis invasive pulmonary zygomycosis specimen bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid supernatant /or tissue lung biopsy available , obtain measurement diagnostic PCR Aspergillus Zygomycete identification , proteomics , cytokine presence galactomannan ( 1-3 ) -Beta-D-glucan . The BAL perform clinically indicated part patient 's routine care pneumonic infiltrates . Blood obtain patient meet eligibility requirement , regardless whether BAL lung tissue biopsy , submit measurement diagnostic PCR Aspergillus Zygomycete identification , proteomics , cytokine , presence galactomannan ( 1-3 ) -Beta-D-glucan host genomics . Digital copy computer tomography ( CT ) image , part routine care utilized reconstruct multi-dimensional volumetric image correlate clinical laboratory outcome extent lung volume involvement .
