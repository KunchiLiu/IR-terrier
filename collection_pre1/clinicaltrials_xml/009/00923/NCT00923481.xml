Phase I study patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura , rheumatoid arthritis , lymphoma demonstrate safety continuous dose schedule , maximum tolerate dose establish . Objectives : - To test experimental drug call R935788 ( fostamatinib disodium ) ability stop cancer growth signal , thus slow growth cancer cell laboratory test . - To determine clinical response R935788 administer orally twice day continuous schedule patient colorectal carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , follicular papillary thyroid cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , hepatocellular , carcinoma head neck , renal cell carcinoma . - To evaluate effect , safety , biochemical response R935788 therapy . Eligibility : - Patients colorectal carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , follicular papillary thyroid cancer , non-small cell lung cancer ( exclude squamous cell histology ) , hepatocellular cancer , carcinoma head neck , renal cell carcinoma whose disease progress therapy acceptable standard treatment option . - Patients must recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . - Patients receive radiation chemotherapy within 4 week study enrollment eligible . - Women pregnant breastfeed eligible . Design : - Researchers conduct follow test procedure study : - Clinic visit physical exam , include vital sign blood pressure , every week cycle 1 , month start cycle 2 . - Blood drawn weekly cycle 1 , every week cycle 2 , month start cycle 3 ; urine test conduct depend result blood test . - Imaging test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( series x-ray ) ultrasound ( examination use sound wave ) , do every 8 week patient receive R935788 . - R935788 administer orally twice day 28 day ( one cycle ) . Imaging study obtain every two cycle . Patients fill diary show take medication note side effect . The 28-day treatment cycle repeat long patient tolerate R935788 cancer either stable get well . - Researchers conduct follow additional test see study affect patient : - Other research blood sample collect treatment , cycle 1 week 3 , begin cycle 2 , 8 week . - Optional tumor biopsy request start treatment , cycle 1 day 28 . - Patients specific lesion tumor may ask optional tumor biopsy day 8 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND - R935788 ( fostamatanib disodium ) kinase inhibitor activity vitro several kinase know mutate aberrantly express malignant cell . - Anticancer drug target multiple kinase particular interest tumor may rely several different kinase pathway survival . - R935788 show promising activity NCI 60-cell line panel colon cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , renal cell carcinoma cell line , well two renal cell xenograft model . R935788 orally absorb tumor-bearing mouse concentration achieve antitumor activity associate observable toxicity . - Phase I study patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura , rheumatoid arthritis lymphoma demonstrate safety continuous dose schedule , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish . OBJECTIVES - To determine clinical response R935788 administer orally twice day continuous schedule patient colorectal carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , follicular , medullary , papillary thyroid cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , carcinoma head neck , renal cell carcinoma . - To evaluate safety R935788 patient various solid tumor . - To determine effect R935788 circulate tumor cell , circulate endothelial cell level phosphorylated AKT extracellular-signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) tumor sample . - To evaluate biochemical response R935788 therapy patient thyroid malignancy pheochromocytoma . ELIGIBILITY - Patients histologically document pheochromocytoma , follicular , medullary , papillary thyroid cancer , colorectal cancer , non-small cell lung carcinoma ( exclude squamous cell histology ) , hepatocellular carcinoma , carcinoma head neck , well renal cell carcinoma ) whose disease progress therapy acceptable standard treatment option . - Radiation chemotherapy permit within 4 week prior study enrollment . - Patients must recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . STUDY DESIGN -This open-label , Phase II study R935788 . Patients receive R935788 orally twice day 28-day cycle without interruption . Imaging study obtain every 2 cycle . Following limited dose escalation portion stratum , two stage design use , initial stage consist 15 21 patient depend tumor type 7 stratum .</detailed_description>
