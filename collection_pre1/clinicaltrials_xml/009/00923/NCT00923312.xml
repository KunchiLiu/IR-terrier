	<brief_summary>This phase I/IIa open , uncontrolled , international , prospective clinical trial , out-patient setting , patient stage IIIB/IV NSCLC . The phase I part study consist dose escalation phase , recommend dose ( RD ) phase IIa part study establish base incidence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . In phase IIa part study , additional patient include RD , confirm safety explore activity dose . This study take place Switzerland ( 2 site ) Germany ( 11 site ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial RNActive®-Derived Cancer Vaccine Stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical Need : Lung cancer lead cause cancer mortality develop country ; 87 % lung cancer NSCLC type . Patients advance non-metastatic disease ( IIIA IIIB ) usually undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy , without secondary surgical resection . Patients progression chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may receive second-line treatment target therapy . Despite aggressive treatment , 5 % patient metastatic disease survive 5 year . Given dismal statistic , clear new therapeutic approach treatment NSCLC urgently need . Potential Benefits : CV9201 mRNA-based vaccine treatment human NSCLC base CureVac 's RNActive® technology . As mRNA-based vaccine , CV9201 feature several advantage approach : highly specific , restriction patient 's MHC genotype , need cross nuclear membrane active . Finally , absence reverse transcriptase , RNA integrate genome . For plan first-in-man study , CV9201 administer 5 dos . The phase I part phase I/IIa study dose find study , determine RD phase IIa part .</detailed_description>
