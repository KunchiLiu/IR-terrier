	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers try learn cause certain type cancer spread organ body ( metastasis ) . Cancer tumor may produce small number specific cell ( cancer stem cell ) cause tumor grow organ throughout body . - By examine cancer tumor tissue , normal tissue , blood , bone marrow , body fluid , researcher may determine whether sample contain cancer stem cell . Cancer stem cell may provide information whether cancer come back spread routine x-ray study lab test indicate presence . Objectives : - To acquire collection solid organ cancer stem cell future study . - To analyze solid organ cancer stem cell various type cancer genetic level . - To determine solid organ cancer stem cell present blood bone marrow . Eligibility : - Patients 16 year age old solid organ cancer ( cancer liver , colon , rectum , anus , pancreas , stomach , breast , skin , muscle , fat , connective tissue , uterus , ovary , cervix , vagina , vulva , inner line abdomen ) precancerous growth , schedule biopsy surgery remove cancer part treatment . Design : - This prospective trial design procure solid organ cancer stem cell either surgery biopsy . - All patient register trial undergo surgery extirpate cancer NCI - Prior surgery biopsy , 8 tablespoon blood drawn . - During surgery biopsy , sample normal tissue remove along cancerous precancerous tissue . If separate consent give , sample bone marrow also take . - After discharge , patient return clinic routine visit every month first 3 month follow surgery , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . During visit , patient routine blood imaging study do , researcher take additional blood sample ( 8 tablespoon visit ) optional bone marrow sample ( 4 teaspoon every 6 month ) use research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Solid Organ Cancer Stem Cells ( SOCSC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Traditional model cancer metastasis posit cancer metastasis might originate stochastically cancer cell , Cancer-Stem-Cell hypothesis suggest metastasize cell Solid Organ Cancer Stem Cells ( SOCSC ) . - SOCSC relatively resistant current cancer therapy . Thus , effective treatment metastatic cancer might require target SOCSC . - Knowledge SOCSC chiefly derive cell line . However , data suggest vast difference cell line SOCSC obtain fresh tumor . - This protocol design facilitate fresh tissue procurement study SOCSC . Primary Objective : -To study natural history SOCSC various primary metastatic solid organ cancer use establish phenotypic functional marker . Secondary Objectives : - To analyze SOCSC potential target use design novel cancer therapy target cancer stem cell . - To determine whether SOCSC present blood and/or bone marrow , study quantitative and/or qualitative change time surgical resection time recurrence and/or metastasis . - To evaluate potential SOCSC quantitative and/or qualitative change time surgery , use future study biomarkers early detection cancer recurrence and/or metastasis . - To collect detailed history , demographic , treatment data well perioperative finding evaluate potential correlation presence absence SOCSC . - To develop animal model investigate potential interaction bone marrow derive stem cell solid organ cancer . - To observe course normal stem cell time patient benign tumor show evidence cancer time . - To compare course normal stem cell stem cell patient solid organ cancer . - To specifically investigate family cluster cancer determine relationship SOCSC potential familial genetic mutation specific particular cancer present , compare genetic abnormality individual family without cancer . Eligibility : - Patients 16 year age old primary metastatic solid organ cancer require resection cancer direct therapy deem best interest cancer care . - Patients premalignant neoplasm schedule undergo surgery biopsy part diagnostic evaluation . - Patients must ECOG performance score 0-2 . - Patients must laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior biopsy surgery . Design : - This prospective trial design procure SOCSC various benign solid organ cancer tumor ( primary metastatic ) follow natural history time surgery cancer direct therapy time recurrence . - SOCSC isolate use phenotypic functional marker . Investigations perform follow tissue : Blood prior surgery , tumor adjacent normal tissue available , bone marrow ( strictly optional separate consent ) , peritoneal washing applicable . - After surgery blood drawn 1 3 month every 3-6 month thereafter follow-up period ( 5 year ) . Bone marrow may analyze every six month follow-up period ( strictly optional ) . - Patients follow standard care cancer direct therapy deem best interest patient . - It anticipate 274 676 patient enrolled period 5 year ( 2-5 patient per month ) .</detailed_description>
