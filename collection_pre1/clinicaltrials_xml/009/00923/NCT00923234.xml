	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study 5-aza lenalidomide act synergistically MDS AML patient chromosomal abnormality involve monosomy 5 del5q . Therefore , phase I study investigate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination fix dose 5-aza patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination 5-azacitidine Lenalidomide Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytogenetics main predictor outcome patient AML . In fact , monosomy 5 del ( 5q ) single aberration poor prognostic marker . Overall , complete response rate conventionally treat patient newly-diagnosed AML chromosome 5 abnormality 31 % 37 % patient rapidly relapse rescue allogeneic HSCT . The situation almost similar patient high-risk MDS.Vidaza® show clinical trial achieve remission rate 29 % ( CR+PR ) patient total 49 % achieve improvement blood counts.Revlimid® also able achieve complete remission advance MDS even overt leukemia without chromosome 5 abnormality . Nevertheless , response rate low compare low-risk MDS ( IPSS Low/INT-1 ) . Therefore , Revlimid® seem weak single agent , promise compound combination therapy .</detailed_description>
