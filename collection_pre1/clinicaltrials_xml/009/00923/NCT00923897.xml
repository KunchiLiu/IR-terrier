	<brief_summary>Palliative radiotherapy radiation treatment give help reduce pain discomfort , symptom related cancer . This use commonly cancer spread bone brain , many primary cancer advance cured , include lung cancer , pancreatic cancer head neck cancer . The benefit palliative radiotherapy advance liver cancer well study . This study design help see whether palliative radiation therapy effective control pain , discomfort symptom relate liver cancer , therapy Phase II Trial Palliative Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatic Metastases might affect quality life patient receive therapy . This information help doctor understand specific condition radiation therapy effective worthwhile , may affect quality life patient locally advance hepatocellular carcinoma hepatic metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Radiotherapy ( RT ) Liver Metastases ( Mets ) Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) ( COLD 4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The liver one common sit tumour involvement , include primary metastatic disease . Gastrointestinal tumour , breast , lung melanoma common primary site hepatic metastasis . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cancer worldwide , 600,000 new case diagnose per year . It third common cause cancer relate death.Although , predominately disease Asia sub-Saharan Africa , incidence HCC increase North America . The use radiation unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma , well hepatic metastasis , palliation uncommon clinical practice . This may prevail perception radiation liver inevitably lead radiation induce liver disease ( RILD ) . However , several single institution , predominantly retrospective study , demonstrate effective palliation locally advance HCC well hepatic metastasis minimal toxicity.In study , palliative radiotherapy ( RT ) , deliver one fraction 8Gy , give symptomatic patient candidate radical treatment . We hypothesize palliative RT provide symptomatic relief large fraction patient , primary metastatic disease . We also expect minimal toxicity treatment dose .</detailed_description>
