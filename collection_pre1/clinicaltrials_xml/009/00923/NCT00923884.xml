	<brief_summary>Background : - The Lung Cancer section National Cancer Institute Medical Oncology Branch run study well understand gene might important patient undergoing therapy lung cancer . Objectives : - To find difference ( also call polymorphism ) specific gene lead difference outcomes ( treatment success survival rate ) patient diagnose lung cancer . - To establish repository genetic information future study differences relation lung cancer . Eligibility : - Any individual diagnosed lung cancer treat National Cancer Institute . Design : - After entrance study , patient provide information researcher age , gender , race/ethnicity , treatment receive response treatment , specific information disease . This information keep confidential . - Approximately half tablespoon blood drawn . - Patients treated lung cancer normal treatment method , enrol study - Some patient may offer option enrol separate research protocols cancer treatment , involve chemotherapy , surgery , radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Lung cancer lead cause cancer death among men woman worldwide . - Despite modern surgical , radiation , chemotherapeutic intervention , prognosis patient lung cancer remain poor , overall cure rate le 15 % . - Genetic polymorphism drug-metabolizing enzyme , transporter , growth factor hormonal receptor , DNA repair enzyme , transcription factor might affect individual response chemotherapy radiation . - Interindividual difference efficacy toxicity cancer chemotherapy radiation especially important give narrow therapeutic index modality . - Many difference extensively explore patient lung cancer . Objectives : - To good understand genotype-phenotype relationship genetic polymorphism clinical outcome , focus overall survival , follow lung cancer therapy . - To good understand difference outcome Caucasian African American patient treat lung cancer function genotype . - To establish DNA repository investigation polymorphism relate outcomes lung cancer . - To develop methodology isolation , enumeration live cell culture circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) lung cancer patient microfiltration device . Eligibility : - All individual diagnosis lung cancer treat Washington D.C. Veterans Affairs Medical Center Medical Oncology Branch National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . Design : - A single 7-ml sample venous blood obtain patient enrol onto study , isolation DNA . - Two 5 ml sample venous blood , draw immediately follow 7 ml sample , obtain patient enrol study NCI Clinical Center ( ) , CTC study . - Polymorphisms follow gene : ABCB1 , ABCG2 , COMT , CYP17 , CYP19 , CYP1B1 , CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2J2 , CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , DPYD , EPHX2 , ERalpha , ERbeta , ERCC1 , ERCC2 , GSTP1 , HIF1A , MPO , MTHFR , NQO1 , p53 , PPARD , SLCO1B3 , TYMS , UGT1A1 , VEGF , VEGFR , EGFR , SLC28A1 , CDA , XRCC1 , OCT1 , OCT2 , CHRNA3 CHRNA5 analyze Clinical Pharmacology Program . - Methodology isolation , enumeration , live cell culture CTC microfiltration device develop NCI Genetics Branch . - Patients follow medical oncology clinic Washington DC VA Medical Center NCI follow information record confidential database : age , gender , race/ethnicity , smoke history , histology , stage , treatment ( ) receive , response , toxicity , time disease progression , time death . - Associations genetic polymorphism response therapy , toxicity clinical outcome analyze . - The result CTC study apply initial development clinical validation CTC technology lung cancer assay .</detailed_description>
