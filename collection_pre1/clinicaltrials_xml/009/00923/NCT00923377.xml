	<detailed_description>Background : Emerging model breast cancer suggest breast cancer arise population stem cell present normal mammary gland . The stem cell produce clone cancer cell . Researchers attempt isolate characterize breast stem cell determine event may initiate tumorigenic process . Objectives : To identify characterize breast stem cell normal breast tissue woman free breast cancer . To compare characteristic breast stem cell woman increase risk breast cancer woman average risk breast cancer . To correlate breast stem cell number characteristic mammographic density . To establish cell culture breast stem cell woman increase risk breast cancer woman average risk breast cancer . Eligibility : Women average increase risk breast cancer age 18 eligible . Design : This pilot tissue acquisition trial . Breast biopsy obtain subject breast cancer risk demographic collect one time point . We aim enroll 20 average risk 20 increase risk woman .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women age 18 old . No abnormal finding breast physical examination . Average Risk : must meet criterion . Gail model index le 1.7 % next 5 year . Claus model lifetime risk le 10 % . BRCAPro Couch model le 10 % BRCA mutation carrier OR test negative document deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation family . Increased risk invasive breast cancer one following : Gail Model risk great 1.7 % 5 year study entry . Claus model lifetime risk age 79 great equal 10 % . History high risk pathologic lesion : lobular carcinoma situ , atypical hyperplasia , DCIS ( ductal carcinoma situ ) . Deleterious mutation BRCA1/2 , PTEN P53 . Greater equal 10 % chance carry BRCA1/2 gene mutation assess BRCAPro Couch model ( 22 , 23 ) . If woman 20 % risk carry BRCA1/2 mutation either model , meet eligibility criterion . History unilateral breast cancer either invasive situ , normal contralateral breast physical examination . Willing stop NSAIDS 3 day prior biopsy aspirin 7 day prior biopsy . If history cancer ( squamous basal cell skin cancer ) , subject must evidence disease time enrollment AND history cancer direct treatment 3 month precede enrollment . Identification dense area breast tissue suitable biopsy identify mammogram radiologist . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Current use hormonal therapy ( e.g . tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor , hormone replacement therapy , oral contraceptive pill , topical vaginal hormone medication allow . ) Chemotherapy radiation within 3 month prior breast biopsy procedure . Breastfeeding within 3 month . Pregnancy ( determine urine dipstick ) . A suspicious unbiopsied lesion physical examination mammography breast ( ) study . Bleeding disorder . Warfarin , low molecular weight heparin , heparin use . History bilateral breast radiation .</criteria>
