	<brief_summary>Background : - An experimental cancer treatment procedure involve take patient tumor blood cell , modify gene target proteins surface tumor cell , grow cell laboratory . The modified cell give back patient intravenous ( IV ) transfusion , hope new cell attack destroy cancer cell without harm healthy tissue . - This procedure use melanoma patient , researcher attempt use treatment patient renal ( kidney ) cancer . In laboratory , attack kill nearly kidney cancer test , normal tissue . However , effectiveness possible side effect treatment still study . Objectives : - To find cell modify target DR4 TRAIL ( two protein find surface many kidney tumor ) effective treat kidney cancer . - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( high dose cause unacceptable side effect ) modify cell . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old metastatic renal cancer whose disease respond standard treatment . - Patients divide two study branch : Arm A receiving modify cell biopsied tumor , Arm B receive modify white blood cell . Design : - Five-stage treatment process , outpatient stage 1 5 inpatient stage 2 4 : - Work-up ( 1 2 week ) : Physical examination , heart lung function test , image test , blood and/or tumor sample take . - IV chemotherapy ( 1 week ) : Cyclophosphamide fludarabine prepare new cell infusion . - IV cell infusion treatment IL-2 support modify cell ( 4 day ) . - Recovery ( 1 2 week ) : Recover effect chemotherapy infusion . - Follow-up ( every 1 6 month ) : Return clinic physical exam , review side effect , test . - Follow-up evaluation continue determine success treatment . - Evaluations treatment period : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Blood urine test . - Disease evaluation monitoring inpatient outpatient basis . - Because researcher know long-term side effect gene therapy , patient ask participate long-term follow 15 year . The follow-up involve yearly physical exam medical history , blood collection ( 3 , 6 12 month treatment , every year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study Metastatic Renal Cancer Using T-Cells Transduced With T-Cell Receptor Which Recognizes TRAIL Bound DR4 Receptor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The clinical administration tumor-reactive T-cells grown vitro highly active therapy patient metastatic melanoma experimental protocol combine preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy systemic IL-2 . - We clone novel T-cell blood patient renal cell cancer ( RCC ) , recognize nearly human renal cancer line irrespective MHC haplotype . - The alpha sign beta sign chain T-cell receptor clone , 2G-1 , introduced human lymphocytes retroviral transduction confers recognition RCC . - This TCR find recognize TNF-related apoptosis induce ligand ( TRAIL ) bound receptor DR4 . - Both TRAIL agonist antibody DR4 tumor specificity current clinical trial cancer . - Two amino acid modification native TCR greatly augment recognition RCCs without alter background reactivity . Objectives : - Primary : - Determine administration T-cells retrovirally transduce 2G-1 TCR , preparative chemotherapy IL-2 , cause regression metastatic RCC . - To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cell incorporate TCR PBL TIL . - Secondary : - Determine toxicity T-cells administer fashion . - Determine TCR vector presence post treatment phase . Eligibility : - Patients measurable metastatic clear cell renal cancer previously receive least one systemic standard care regimen progress find intolerant standard therapy . - Patients must eligible high-dose IL-2 . - Patients must active clinically symptomatic CNS metastasis within previous 3 month . - Patients must acceptable hematopoietic major organ function determine laboratory and/or functional testing . Design : - A phase I-II dose escalate protocol 2 arm . Patients Arm A receive peripheral blood lymphocyte transduce 2G-1 TCR ; patient Arm B receive renal TIL transduce 2G-1 TCR . Arm B begin safe dose define Arm A . - Once MTD establish arm , 24 patient enrolled arm phase II stage . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow one four day IV infusion transduce cell subsequent IV aldesleukin administration . - Up 106 patient may enrol 3-4 year .</detailed_description>
