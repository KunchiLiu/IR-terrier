	<brief_summary>Background : Low-dose chemotherapy easy body tolerate typical high-dose chemotherapy involve short period complete immune suppression . Donor immune cell call lymphocyte , T cell , fight residual tumor cell might remain recipient body stem cell transplant , call graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect . The immune-suppressing drug sirolimus appear help prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , side effect stem cell transplant donate T cell sometimes attack healthy tissue , damage organ liver , intestine skin . Th2 cell cell collect transplant donor grow high concentration sirolimus . Objectives : To determine whether stem cell transplantation use low-dose chemotherapy sirolimus-generated Th2 cell cause remission advance kidney cancer . Eligibility : Patients 18 75 year age kidney cancer spread beyond kidney tissue-matched sibling stem cell donor . Design : Patients undergo stem cell transplantation follow : - Low-intensity chemotherapy pentostatin cyclophosphamide 21-day period reduce level immune system prepare transplant . Pentostatin give vein ( intravenous ( IV ) ) day 1 , 8 15 ; cyclophosphamide tablet take mouth 21 consecutive day . - Sirolimus tablet , take mouth , start 2 day transplant continue 60 day transplant . - IV infusion stem cell Th2 cell . Following transplant , patient follow procedure : - Additional Th2 cell infusion day 14 45 transplant . - Follow-up visit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center twice week first 6 month transplant less frequently least 5 year evaluate response treatment treatment side effect . Evaluations include bone marrow aspirate biopsy 1 month transplant periodic blood test image procedure ( e.g. , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) represent potentially effective treatment option patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . In pilot clinical trial refractory hematologic malignancy subject , find augmentation T cell-replete allograft donor Th2 cell generate ex vivo sirolimus ( rapamycin ; Th2.rapa cell ) allow prompt donor engraftment outpatient-intensity chemotherapy . This transplant approach associate low incidence acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Based data , seek safely achieve objective clinical regression metastatic RCC follow new transplant approach . ( 1 ) The allograft administer low intensity , outpatient induction chemotherapy regimen consist pentostatin cyclophosphamide . This regimen intend provide sufficient host immune T cell depletion , , conventional preparative regimen administer . ( 2 ) To avoid mixed chimerism rapid potentiation graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect , growth colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize allograft augment donor lymphocyte infusion day 14 post-transplant consist Th2.rapa cell . Objectives : Primary objective : ( 1 ) Determine whether new , low-intensity transplant approach yield objective partial complete remission metastatic RCC , goal rule partial response ( PR ) /complete response ( CR ) rate 20 % favor rate 60 % . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) Evaluate safety immune-depleting property pentostatin/cyclophosphamide regimen ; ( 2 ) Characterize engraftment kinetics GVHD profile new transplant approach ; ( 3 ) Characterize post-transplant immunity study subject , include cytokine phenotype , immune reconstitution , potential anti-tumor effector mechanism . Eligibility : Adults ( 18 - 75 year ) metastatic RCC eligible 6/6 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling donor . Must one prior therapy either sorafenib , sunitib , temsirolimus Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved agent therapy metastatic renal cell carcinoma.. Life expectancy great equal 3 month , Karnofsky score great equal 80 , relatively normal organ function , absence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Design : Patients receive 21-day course pentostatin ( intravenous infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 ; 4 mg/m^2 per dose ) daily oral cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg per day ) . Patients receive mobilize , T cell-replete allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell graft follow pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion donor Th2 cell day 14 post-transplant . GVHD prophylaxis consist short-course sirolimus plus maintenance therapy cyclosporine A . If great equal 2/5 partial complete response observe within 6 month post-transplant , therapy consider potentially promising , expand Simon two-stage design evaluate total n = 14 subject . If great equal 5/14 PR/CR achieve , therapy consider worthy investigation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Recipient Diagnosis metastatic renal cell carcinoma , either clear cell type nonclear cell type . The diagnosis must confirm Laboratory Pathology National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Hackensack ( central pathology review ) . The consent process include discussion potential role highdose interleukin2 ( IL2 ) therapy prior protocol enrollment . Highdose IL2 therapy widely available , may available NCI protocol ( Dr. Yang ) Dr. Alter Hackensack patient . IL2 therapy may also administer qualified physician ; Novartis website list physician . For subject deem eligible highdose IL2 elect receive therapy , subject must progressive disease postIL2 enter study ; subject must also receive progressive disease therapy one agent list . Subject must progressive disease therapy consist one follow Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve agent : sorafenib , sunitib , temsirolimus . Patients 18 75 year age . Subjects older 75 enrolled due increase rate transplantrelated complication . Must consent sibling match 6/6 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antigens ( A , B , DR ) . Patient legal guardian must able give informed consent . All previous therapy must complete least 2 week prior study entry . Any grade 3 4 nonhematologic toxicity previous therapy must resolve grade 2 less . Karnofsky performance status great equal 80 % . Life expectancy least 3 month . Left ventricular ejection fraction great 40 % ( multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) echo ) within 28 day enrollment . Carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) great 50 % expect value ( hemoglobin ( Hb ) correct ) , obtain within 28 day enrollment . Creatinine clearance great equal 40 ml/min .
