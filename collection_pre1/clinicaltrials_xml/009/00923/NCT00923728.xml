	<brief_summary>Background : - AVN944 experimental cancer treatment drug , yet approve U.S. Food Drug Administration . To date , AVN944 single drug test several study involve human , include healthy volunteer , patient leukemia , patient advance pancreatic cancer . - More research need determine safety effectiveness AVN944 . Objectives : - To determine safety AVN944 . - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( high dose cause unacceptable side effect ) AVN944 . - To see AVN944 effect patient ' tumor . - To learn body break AVN944 . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old advanced stage solid tumor standard therapy exist longer effective . Design : - Participants screen visit five clinic visit first treatment cycle . Additional treatment cycle involve two clinic visit 28-day cycle . After participation study end , patient ask return within 28 day last dose study drug final study procedure . - Evaluations treatment period : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Questions medication side effect . - Blood urine test . - Disease evaluation CT , chest x-ray , additional laboratory test depend type cancer . - All patient blood sample take visit . - Patients take specific dos AVN994 direct researcher , ask keep diary record dose side effect . They monitor frequent blood draw study visit provide information safety effectiveness drug . - During different cycle , patient disease evaluated researcher ask wish continue take AVN994 part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The rate limit step synthesis guanine nucleotide catalyze enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) inhibition enzyme result depletion guanine nucleotide pool , cessation DNA synthesis , cell cycle block Gr ( 1 ) /S interface interference cell division . - The reduction guanine nucleotide pool interfere ability G-coupled proteins act intracellular signal transducer . IMPDH inhibition . - AVN944 small-molecule , uncompetitive inhibitor cell proliferation . - A Phase I study patient hematologic malignancy active accruing subject . The maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) reach pattern organ-specific dose-progressive toxicity observe . Objectives : Primary - The dose limiting toxicity AVN944 patient advance stage solid tumor . - The MTD AVN944 patient advance stage solid tumor . Secondary : - Pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics AVN944 study cohort . - The extent IMPDH inhibition tumor tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . - The effect AVN944 tumor measure guanine nucleotide pool level use PBMC 's . - The effect AVN944 tumor analyze expression gene relate IMPDH . Eligibility : - Inclusion : - Patients must histologically confirm malignancy . - Patients must least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy 2 week since prior hormonal therapy . - ECOG performance status less equal 2 . - Life expectancy great 3 month . - Age great equal 18 . - Exclusion : - Patients know active brain metastasis CNS involvement . - History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic . - Prior treatment IMPDH-inhibitor . - History solid organ transplant IMPDFI inhibitor therapy . Design : - Phase I Trial use 3+3 trail design use start cohort 150 mg twice per day escalate 750 mg twice per day . - 60 patient enrol 30-36 month . - AVN944 administer 28 day treatment cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must histologically confirm malignancy ( histopathological documentation cancer confirm NCI Laboratory Pathology National Institutes Health , Pathology Department Walter Reed Medical Center , Pathology Department National Naval Medical Center , prior start study ) metastatic unresectable standard therapy exist longer effective . 2 . Patients must least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy 2 week since prior hormonal therapy except gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) analogues acute serious side effect therapy Grade le 1 return baseline 3 . Patients must able willing take oral capsule . 4 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month 6 . Patients must acceptable organ marrow function define : Leukocytes great equal 3,000/mcL Absolute Neutrophil Count great equal 1,500/mcL Platelets great equal 100,000/mcL Total Bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN ( patient know Gilberts syndrome may value high less equal 3.0 X ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal 7 . The effect AVN944 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 9 . Age great equal 18 Years . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AVN944 patient less 18 year age , child exclude study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients receive concurrent investigational therapy receive investigational therapy within 14 day first schedule day dose ( investigational therapy define treatment currently regulatory authority approve indication ) . Clinically significant toxicity therapy must resolve less Grade 2 . 2 . Patients know active brain metastasis CNS involvement le 6 month since curativeintent treatment 3 . Patients receive growth factor 4 . Prior treatment IMPDHinhibitor e.g . Mycophenolate Mofetil , &amp; Tiazofurin 5 . Uncontrolled current illness require hospitalization intravenous antibiotic within past 7 day 6 . Pregnant woman exclude study AVN944 agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother AVN944 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated AVN944 . 7 . History solid organ transplant IMPDH inhibitor ( mycophenolate mofetil ) therapy 8 . HIVpositive patient 9 . The following medication and/or treatment permit trial ( i.e. , completion post treatment followup ) would constitute exclusion protocol : Any investigational treatment Any cytotoxic chemotherapy Any systemic antineoplastic therapy include , limited , immunotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy . Any radiotherapy , include systemically administer radioisotope . Systemic corticosteroid . Any hormonal therapy except GnRH agonist / antagonist patient prostate cancer medroxyprogesterone Growth factor</criteria>
