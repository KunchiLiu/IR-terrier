	<brief_summary>Background : - Most patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) many patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) protein call Wilm 's Tumor 1 ( WT1 ) cancer cell . This protein think able influence growth cancer . - A vaccine make WT1 protein may boost immune system help fight cancer patient whose cancer cell contain protein . Objectives : - To determine safety , effectiveness side effect give WT1 vaccine donor white blood cell patient AML , ALL , CML NHL previously receive standard treatment undergone stem cell transplantation . - To determine immune response WT1 vaccine donor white blood cell patient determine response related amount WT1 protein patient 's cancer cell . Eligibility : - Patients 1 75 year age blood antigen human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A2 ) WT1 cancer protein persistent recurrent blood cancer stem cell transplantation . - The prior stem cell transplant donor must willing provide additional cell , use prepare cellular vaccine donor lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) infusion . Design : - Patients give WT1 vaccine every 2 week 6 week ( week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) . Each vaccination consist two injection upper arm thigh . - On week 0 , 4 8 , patient also receive white blood cell donor enhance immune response . The cell also give 15- 30-minute infusion vein 1 hour vaccine injection . Donor infusion give patient mild graft-vs-host disease result prior stem cell transplantation . - Periodic physical examination , blood urine test , scan evaluate disease test need do 12 month enrollment study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Efforts incorporate anti-tumor immunotherapy stage minimal residual disease ( MRD ) burden limit profound host immune depletion associate standard anti-cancer therapy . - Allogeneic blood marrow stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) curative number hematologic malignancy . Part success approach allogeneic immunologic reaction demonstrate play role eradication residual malignant disease transplant certain cancer ( call graft-versus-leukemia , GVL , graft-versus-tumor , GVT , effect ) . Nonetheless , relapse remain primary cause treatment failure allogeneic SCT . - The Wilm 's tumor 1 ( WT1 ) gene product tumor-associated antigen represent potential target immunotherapy wide array cancer . WT1 express case acute leukemia many case chronic myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome . Importantly , WT1 limit expression normal tissue beyond embryogenesis . This trial represent attempt incorporate antigen-specific immunotherapy set allogeneic adoptive cell transfer . Objectives : - To determine safety , toxicity , feasibility donor-derived dendritic cell vaccination donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) allogeneic SCT . - To determine frequency severity graft-vs.-host disease ( GVHD ) patient treat peptide-loaded donor-derived dendritic cell vaccination donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . - To evaluate whether immunologic response WT1-specific peptide generate peptide-loaded donor-derived dendritic cell vaccination DLI allogeneic SCT . - To evaluate whether clinical response WT1-specific peptide generate peptide-loaded donor-derived dendritic cell vaccination DLI allogeneic SCT . - To evaluate whether immunologic and/or clinical response may associate degree WT1 expression malignant cell pre-existing donor anti-WT1 immunity . Eligibility : - HLA-A2 plus patient may enrol trial relapse residual disease follow allogeneic SCT WT1 express hematologic malignancy . - Donors previous SCT , relate unrelated , must 5- 6- antigen genotypic HLA-matched ( single HLA-A B locus mismatch allow ) HLAA2 plus . Design : - This pilot study , primary aim ass safety feasibility novel vaccine strategy aim enhance GVL effect allogeneic SCT . - Donor-derived dendritic cell prepared peripheral blood monocyte load combination three WT1-derived peptide . These peptide comprise one WT1-derived oligomeric epitope know bind HLA-A2 11-mer protein transduction epitope know enhance peptide load antigen presentation . - Patients receive donor-derived dendritic cell vaccine every 14 day 6 dos . Donor leukocyte infusion ( DLI ) also administer vaccine . - Study endpoint include toxicity , feasibility , antigen-specific immunity , disease response . - This exploratory pilot trial . Up 12 patient treat . - Stopping rule take effect excessive toxicity ( e.g. , GVHD ) inability generate vaccine observe .</detailed_description>
