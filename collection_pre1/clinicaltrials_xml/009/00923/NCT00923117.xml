	<brief_summary>Background : One way tumor able grow form new blood vessel supply nutrient oxygen . Sunitinib block certain protein surface tumor blood vessel cell involve formation new blood vessel . Blocking protein may prevent tumor cell blood vessel continue grow . Objectives : To determine whether sunitinib cause tumor shrink stabilize patient recurrent brain cancer . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old brain cancer whose disease worsen standard treatment surgery , radiation . Design : Patients take sunitinib pill day 4-week treatment cycle . Treatment may continue long tumor remain stable decrease size side effect treatment tolerate . Routine blood test do every 2 week first 8 week treatment every 4 week . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan do start treatment ( baseline ) end every 4-week cycle monitor tumor growth . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan do baseline end first cycle . Neurological physical examination do baseline , week 2 treatment end every treatment cycle . Health-related quality life assess every 4 week . Pregnancy test , electrocardiogram echocardiograms repeat need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Solid tumor multiple mechanism stimulate angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) axis one . Sunitinib , multiple tyrosine kinase receptor target , represent attempt capitalize concept target multiple mechanism responsible glioma-associated angiogenesis . Sunitinib inhibit platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) c-kit ( stem cell factor ( SCF ) receptor ) nanomolar concentration . The combination block three know major glioma-mediated angiogenic mechanism ( VEGF , c-kit , PDGF ) . Based scientific rationale , promise anti-glioma activity sunitinib preclinical model , promise clinical data patient gliomas treat VEGF inhibitor , propose phase II trial sunitinib patient recurrent malignant glioma . Objectives : To evaluate anti-glioma activity sunitinib patient recurrent malignant glioma either naive resistant prior bevacizumab therapy . Eligibility : Patients recurrent malignant glioma eligible study . Design : This phase II study target enrollment 64 ( 32 glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) 32 anaplastic glioma ( AG ) ) patient progress prior treatment anti-VEGF therapy , 64 ( 32 GBM 32 AG ) patient progress prior bevacizumab therapy . Sunitinib self-administered orally 37.5 mg daily , dose adjustment allow toxicity concomitant drug interaction . The primary endpoint six-month progression free survival arm study . We perform interim analysis ( see ) consult pharmaceutical company ( Pfizer ) believe end study appropriate course action take . In original design trial , AG stratum , agent consider effective least 14 patient progress 6 month . Now , observe one 10 Bev-na√Øve n't progress 6 month . Then give one patient first 10 patient whose PFS &gt; =6 , conditional probability observe least 14 32 patient 6 month-PFS 43 % even true 6 months-PFS 55 % . Since first 10 patient , observe one patient PFS &gt; =6 month , unlikely true 6 month-PFS 55 % . The conditional power would close zero , true 6 month-PFS close 10 % observe far . Based conditional probability , chance positive study small , hence trial consider stopped futility . For Bev-resistant patient , first 12 patient none PFS &gt; = 6 month conditional probability declare agent effective even low equal 12 % , true PFS 6 month 55 % . Essentially little chance agent declare effective .</detailed_description>
