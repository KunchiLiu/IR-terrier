	<brief_summary>Background : - Melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART-1 ) gp100 two gene find melanoma cell . An experimental procedure develop treat patient advanced melanoma us gene type virus make special cell call anti-MART-1 anti-gp100 cell , design destroy patient 's tumor . The cell create laboratory use patient 's tumor cell blood cell . - The procedure also use one two vaccines-the anti-MART-1 peptide anti-gp100 peptide-to stimulate cell immune system may increase effectiveness anti-MART-1 anti-gp100 cell . Both vaccine make virus modify carry copy MART-1 gene gp100 gene . The virus cause disease human . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness anti-MART-1 anti-gp100 cell peptide vaccine treat patient advanced melanoma . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age metastatic melanoma standard treatment , include aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) therapy boost immune response , effective . Design : - Participants initial evaluation complete medical history , well scan , x-rays , test direct researcher . Most treatment study give inpatient basis . - Before treatment begin , participant undergo leukapheresis ( removal select blood cell ) obtain cell prepare anti-MART-1 anti-gp100 cell , later stem cell transplantation . - Preinfusion treatment : 5 day chemotherapy 2 day total-body irradiation prepare immune system receive anti-MART-1 anti-gp100 cell . - Infusion cell , follow IL-2 treatment improve immune response . IL-2 give 15-minute infusion vein every 8 hour maximum 15 dos ( 5 day ) . - After cell infusion , participant divide two group receive either gp100 peptide MART-1 vaccine , give week 3 week . Participants also stem cell transplantation ( previously collect stem cell ) promote cell survival . - Periodic follow-up clinic visit hospital discharge physical examination , review treatment side effect , laboratory test scan every 1 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - We engineer human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) express T-cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize human leukocyte antigen ( HLAA*0201 ) restrict epitope derive gp100 MART-1 melanoma antigen . - We construct single retroviral vector contain Alpha Beta T cell receptor ( TCR ) chain mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency ( great 30 percent ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures HLA-A*0201 positive melanoma TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon-gamma ( IFN-y ) significant secretion observe control co-cultures . - gp100:154-162 TCR MART-1:27-35 TCR transduce T-cells could efficiently kill HLAA*0201 positive tumor . There little recognition normal fibroblast . - Adoptive transfer either TCR transfer gene modified peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) follow nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting regimen could mediate tumor regression 13-30 percent patient metastatic melanoma though complete response see . Objectives : Primary objective : - In cohort 1 2 , determine administration anti-gp100:154-162 TCR-engineered anti- MART-1:27-35 TCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) , aldesleukin either gp100:154-162 peptide MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide patient follow chemoradiation lymphodepleting preparative regimen result complete tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - In cohort 3 4 , determine administration anti-gp100:154-162 TCR-engineered anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR-engineered CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) , aldesleukin either gp100:154-162 peptide MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide patient follow chemoradiation lymphodepleting preparative regimen result complete tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - Determine whether administration specific vaccine ( gp100:154-162 peptide MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide ) increase persistence specific transfer cell ( anti-gp100:154-162 TCR PBL , anti-gp100:154-162 TCR CD8+ PBL , anti-MART- 1:27-35 TCR PBL , anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR CD8+ PBL ) , respectively . Secondary objective : - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must : - metastatic melanoma measurable disease - previously treat IL-2 melanoma ; - normal value basic laboratory value . Patients may : - concurrent major medical illness ; - form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; - severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - In cohort 1 2 : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10 ( 9 ) cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin separate aliquot transduce anti-gp100:154-162 TCR anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR retroviral vector . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 time 10 ( 8 ) cell supernatant contain retroviral vector . These gp100 MART-1 TCR transduce cell separately expand tested anti-tumor activity . - Once engineer lymphocyte demonstrate biologically active accord strict criterion outline Certificate Analysis , patient receive chemoradiation lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine 600 cGy total body irradiation follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , gp100 MART-1 TCR gene-transduced cell plus IV aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . - Patients randomize receive either gp100:154-162 peptide MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide emulsify incomplete Freund 's adjuvant . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment monthly approximately 3 4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol two cohort . If none 21 patient per cohort experience complete clinical response , patient enrol 1 first 21 evaluable patient enrol cohort complete clinical response , accrual cohort continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol cohort . - Cohort 1 2 close approval amendment D. - Cohort 3 4 initiated approval amendment D. - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10 ( 9 ) cell ) CD8+ cell select culture , use Miltenyi CliniMACS apparatus , prior stimulate transduce . Separate aliquot CD8+ cell transduce anti-gp100:154-162 TCR anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR retroviral vector . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 time 10 ( 8 ) CD8+ cell supernatant contain retroviral vector .
