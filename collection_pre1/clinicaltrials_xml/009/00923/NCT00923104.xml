	<brief_summary>Background : - Blister fluid contain many biomarkers ( substance use determine effect certain kind treatment ) blood urine sample , particularly regard change skin . - The Radiation Oncology Branch others conduct research study require blood urine sample healthy volunteer patient cancer . In addition sample , researcher would like collect fluid blister examine marker inflammation skin . Objectives : - To compare blood , urine , blister fluid sample patient cancer undergo radiation therapy volunteer without cancer receive radiation therapy . - To gather information effect radiation therapy skin body fluids individual . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old receive radiation therapy either breast prostate cancer . - A separate group healthy volunteer also participate study . Design : - Physical examination blood sample determine eligibility study . - Blister induction , conduct start radiation treatment , completion radiotherapy ( last day treatment ) , visit 12 month end radiation treatment . - Blisters create use suction blister device hip ( patient prostate cancer ) treat breast location remove breast ( patient breast cancer ) . - Blisters take approximately 30 minute form , fluid remove needle syringe . - Blood urine sample also collect time . - Radiation treatment breast prostate cancer conduct accord standard procedure , direct separate research protocol . - Evaluations treatment period : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Blood urine test . - Disease evaluation . - Post-treatment evaluation : - Clinic visit month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 end radiation therapy physical examination disease assessment . - Study end 1 year final radiation treatment , upon collection final ( third ) blister fluid sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blister fluid use measure cytokine expression , proteomic profile , pharmacokinetics variety disease state . Blister fluid inside radiation treatment field show altered expression cytokine product collagen metabolism . Evaluation blister fluid normal skin inside outside radiation field may allow development minimally invasive marker radiation exposure damage induce radiation irradiate skin . OBJECTIVES : This protocol evaluate ability determine cytokine pattern global change protein level measure blister fluid correlate radiation exposure , absorb skin dose , skin toxicity patient receive radiation . ELIGIBILITY : Patients radiotherapy require standard management breast prostate cancer . Healthy volunteer history cutaneous inflammatory condition skin eczema , psoriasis . DESIGN : This protocol design evaluate blister fluid radiation field patient receive radiation therapy healthy volunteer . Patients undergo blister induction blister fluid collection prior treatment outside radiation field , completion radiation within radiation field . Blisters induce non-sun exposed area possible match site ( i.e . leave right ) .</detailed_description>

Patients require concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy except note ( Protocol section 2.3.1 ) exclude . 6 . Patients history lupus erythematosis , scleroderma , ataxia telengiectasia know hypersensitivity therapeutic radiation . 7 . Patients prior radiotherapy site would use blister induction . 8 . Patients pregnant potential mutagenic effect radiation develop fetus newborn . 9 . Patients unrelated systemic illness judgment Principal Investigator ( PI ) would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy likely interfere study procedure result . 10 . Patients estimation PI , deem unable unlikely adhere protocol treatment . 11 . Patients significant skin atrophy would interfere blister formation . 12 . Breast cancer patient site radiotherapy include myocutaneous flap skin graft . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Healthy volunteer older 18 year age . 2 . Ability provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . History chronic skin disease psoriasis , eczema , history keloid formation . 2 . Concurrent use glucocorticoid therapy . 3 . History lupus erythematosis , scleroderma , ataxia telengiectasia know hypersensitivity therapeutic radiation . 4 . Prior radiotherapy site would use blister induction ( benign malignant cause ) . 5 . Unrelated systemic illness judgment Principal Investigator ( PI ) would compromise patient ability tolerate blister induction likely interfere blister healing , study procedure , study result . 6 . Darkly pigment skin pigmentation change likely complication 7 . Significant skin atrophy would interfere blister formation .</criteria>
