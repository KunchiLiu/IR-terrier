	<brief_summary>Background : - Pediatric solid tumor ( Ewing 's sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastoma ) often difficult cure standard treatment . - Immune therapy use experimental vaccine make protein patient 's tumor cell may boost body 's immune response tumor . - The effect chemotherapy immune system potentially make immunotherapy effective administer soon completion chemotherapy . The addition recombinant human IL-7 ( interleukin 7 ) ( rhIL-7 ( recombinant human interleukin 7 ) ) may make immunotherapy effective . Objectives : -To determine whether immune therapy give immune suppression help body fight tumor determine safety treatment . Eligibility : -Patients solid tumor , i.e. , Ewing 's sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma neuroblastoma whose disease recur treatment spread beyond original site Design : - Patients undergo tumor biopsy ( removal piece tumor tissue ) collect tumor cell make vaccine protein patient 's tumor apheresis ( removal quantity white blood cell ) collect white cell re-building immune system immune therapy . Apheresis repeat three time immunotherapy ( week 8 , 14 20 ) . - After receive standard chemotherapy tumor ( additional course fludarabine cyclophosphamide suppress immunity need ) patient receive immune therapy Cohorts A B. rhIL-7 give 48 hour vaccine , injection skin extremity use vaccine patient Cohort B . You watch closely 6 hour rhIL-7 sign reaction . rhIL-7 give vaccine dose # 1 , # 2 , # 3 , # 4 . The vaccine give study week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . Each vaccine give total six separate rhIL-7 follow injection : three intradermal ( like ( tuberculosis ) TB test ) one arm leg three subcutaneous ( like insulin injection diabetes ) . arm leg . An anesthetic cream may use minimize discomfort injection . - Patients ' white cell return infusion vein first day immune therapy . - Imaging study immune study do week 1 , 8 20 determine response treatment tumor immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients recurrent metastatic pediatric solid tumor experience low survival rate , use current standard therapy , many patient disease render state minimal residual disease associate lymphopenia . - Lymphopenic host show augment immune reactivity , may favorable induce antitumor immune response . Objectives : - To determine whether Alpha cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) 8H9 deplete autologous lymphocyte plus tumor lysate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) pulse dendritic cell vaccine plus minus r-hIL7 ( CYT107 ) induce immune response tumor lysate patient population render lymphopenic cytotoxic therapy . - To assess safety administer lymphocyte deplete cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) plus CD25plus suppressor T cell plus minus r-hIL ( CYT107 ( interleukin 7 ) ) lymphopenic host . Eligibility : - Patients metastatic recurrent pediatric solid tumor follow histology : Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma neuroblastoma , synovial cell sarcoma , desmoplastic small round cell tumor , undifferentiated sarcoma , embryonal sarcoma . - Patients must sufficient accessible tumor biopsy generate tumor lysate . - Patients must meet eligibility criterion upon enrollment upon completion standard therapy prior administration immunotherapy significant time elapse time point . Design : - Immunotherapy consist one autologous lymphocyte infusion deplete CD25plus suppressive T cell deplete contaminate tumor cell plus 6 sequential tumor lysate/KLH pulse dendritic cell vaccine . No cytokine administer Arm A r-hIL7 ( CYT107 ) administer Arm B . - Patients evaluate immune response tumor lysates use ex vivo assay delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . - The trial use one-stage design target response rate 50 percent . Up 47 patient treat . - Stopping rule take effect excessive toxicity observe .</detailed_description>
