	<brief_summary>Background : - Carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) protein present mostly cancer cell . - An experimental procedure develop treat patient cancer use blood cell find tumor bloodstream . These cell genetically modify use anti-CEA gene type virus . The modified cell ( anti-CEA cell ) grow laboratory give back patient try decrease size tumor . This call gene therapy . Objectives : - To determine whether advanced cancer express CEA antigen treat effectively lymphocytes ( white blood cell ) genetically engineer contain anti-CEA protein . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old metastatic cancer ( cancer spread beyond original site ) standard treatment effective . - Patients ' tumor express CEA antigen . - Patients human leukocyte ( HLA-A*0201 ) antigen . Design : - Workup scan , x-rays test . - Leukapheresis obtain cell prepare anti-CEA cell later infusion . - 1 week chemotherapy prepare immune system receive anti-CEA cell . - Infusion anti-CEA cell , follow interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) treatment . The cell give infusion vein . IL-2 give 15-minute infusion vein every 8 hour maximum 15 dos . - 1-2 week recovery effect chemotherapy IL-2 . - Periodic follow-up clinic visit hospital discharge physical examination , review treatment side effect , laboratory test scan every 1 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha beta chain T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , use mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency ( great 30 % ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures HLA-A2 CEA positive tumor , anti-CEA TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - To evaluate safety administration anti-CEA TCR engineer peripheral blood lymphocytes patient receive non-myeloablative condition regimen aldesleukin . - To determine administration anti-CEA TCR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express CEA . - To determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . Secondary objective : - To determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must - metastatic cancer whose tumor express CEA antigen life limit component disease hepatic metastasis ; - previously receive non-responder recur standard care metastatic disease ; Patients : - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10 ( 9 ) cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 time 10 ( 8 ) cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-CEA TCR gene . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous ( IV ) infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . Patients receive CD8-enhanced anti-CEA TCR transduce cell . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , six cohort . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) particular dose level , three patient would treat 3 dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) prior start phase II portion . If DLT occur first cohort , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , patient accrue de-escalation cohort . - Once MTD determine , study would proceed phase II portion . Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic colorectal cancer , cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer express CEA . - For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - The objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-CEA TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
