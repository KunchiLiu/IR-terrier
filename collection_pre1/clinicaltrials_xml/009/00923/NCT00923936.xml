	<brief_summary>Background : - The drug liposomal doxorubicin approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) . A second drug , bevacizumab , biologic agent ( antibody , interleukin , vaccine ) stop abnormal blood supply tumor . Bevacizumab approve FDA , combination drug , treatment breast cancer , colon cancer , lung cancer . - Researchers study combination liposomal doxorubicin bevacizumab novel approach treatment advance KS . Researches measure KS tumor response combination determine whether drug might anti-KS activity . Objectives : - To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) six cycle liposomal doxorubicin combine bevacizumab patient advanced KS . - To evaluate safety regimen estimate complete response rate six cycle , median number cycle need obtain partial response , 12-month progression-free survival . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year older relatively severe AIDS-related KS patient KS unrelated AIDS HIV infection , whose KS evaluate potential response therapy meet number criterion . - Women pregnant breastfeed eligible . - Other ineligibility criterion include surgery within 4 week , chemotherapy within 3 week , heart disease , hemoptysis ( cough blood ) , gastrointestinal bleeding . Design : - Researchers conduct follow test start study : - Physical examination detail medical history . - A biopsy . - Blood urine test . - Treatment include two phase , induction phase maintenance phase : - Induction phase dose : Intravenous ( IV ) bevacizumab 15 mg/kg , follow 7 day later liposomal doxorubicin mg/m2 bevacizumab every 3 week six cycle . Maintenance phase dose : IV bevacizumab every 3 week 11 cycle . - Monitoring include review side effect , physical exam ( include blood pressure ) , blood urine sample ; follow induction phase , patient receive multi gate acquisition scan electrocardiography ( EKG ) record electrical activity heart . - Research test include blood saliva sample , additional biopsy ( optional ) , noninvasive imaging . - Treatment stop follow occur : completion 1 year therapy , progressive KS , patient preference , unacceptable toxicity . - Post-treatment evaluation include clinic visit every 3 month need 2 year , blood saliva sample ( research ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Liposomal Doxorubicin Combined With Bevacizumab Followed Bevacizumab Monotherapy Adults With Advanced Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Standard treatment advance Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) liposomal anthracycline , plus antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) patient HIV . - KS curable relapse common . Prolonged use liposomal anthracyclines cumulative dose exceed 550 mg/m ( 2 ) frequently require . - KS notable pathogenic autocrine paracrine VEGF signaling . The monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab rational agent treatment KS . - Preliminary result phase II study bevacizumab monotherapy , 03-C0110 , suggest bevacizumab promising activity treatment KS . - The combination anti-angiogenic therapy cytotoxic chemotherapy successful strategy KS well solid tumor . - This pilot study evaluate activity safety liposomal doxorubicin combine bevacizumab follow bevacizumab maintenance patient advance KS . A goal combination strategy develop tolerable highly active regimen would limit need prolonged anthracycline use . Objectives : - The primary objective estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) six cycle liposomal doxorubicin combine bevacizumab patient advanced KS . - Secondary objective include evaluation safety regimen , well estimation complete response rate 6 cycle , median number cycle need obtain partial response , 12-month progression-free survival . Eligibility : Inclusion criterion : - Age great equal 18 - Biopsy proven KS - Indication chemotherapy - Any HIV status - Normal MUGA - Able tolerate aspirin 81 mg - SBP &lt; 150 , DBP &lt; 90 - Urine protein &lt; 1+ 500mg/24hrs Exclusion Criteria : - Surgery within 4 week - Thrombo-embolic disease - Chemotherapy within 3 week - Hemoptysis severe gastrointestinal bleeding , unless cause KS - Pregnancy breast feed Design : - This open label , single center pilot 2 cohort . Cohort 1 : HIV negative , HIV infect stable KS despite 1 year HAART HIV viremic control , HIV infect progressive KS despite 4 month HAART HIV viremic control . Cohort 2 : All patient advance AIDS-associated KS . - Subjects receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m ( 2 ) every 3 week complete response ( CR ) maximum 6 cycle . Those stable disease well continue bevacizumab 15 mg/kg monotherapy every 3 week 11 cycle . HIV infected subject receive HAART . - ORR calculate 80 % CI cohort separately . If estimate two cohort similar ( p &gt; 0.30 Fisher exact test ) , may combine form somewhat precise estimate ORR 6 cycle treatment . - A total 10 evaluable patient accrue cohort .</detailed_description>
