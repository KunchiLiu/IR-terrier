This study design investigate method reduce time plan radiation treatment actual start automate intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) planning process . The investigator plan examine data another scan call Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) . A CBCT scan provide similar information conventional CT scan , however image CBCT acquire treatment unit ( linear accelerator use treatment ) . Using x-ray picture patient , study team consist radiation oncologist , medical physicist radiation therapist create custom treatment plan unique patient .
