	<brief_summary>Background : - The combination anti-cancer drug vandetanib ( give orally ) bortezomib ( give intravenously ) use human . However , drug study separately . Bortezomib approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma , vandetanib still investigation pending FDA approval . - Both bortezomib vandetanib investigation use treat certain kind cancer . Researchers hope combination two drug effective either alone . Objectives : - To determine combination vandetanib bortezomib decrease amount cancer , , determine long response last . - To determine side effect may occur combination treatment . - To determine dos drug well tolerate safe give together . - To study genetic mutation tumor well understand tumor grow drug interact tumor . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old solid tumor surgically remove either recur show growth . The tumor ( ) must able evaluated X-ray , MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , CT ( computerized tomography ) scanning . - Patients diagnose medullary thyroid cancer participate Phase II study . Design : - Tumor sample may take start study research purpose . - Phase I : Patient group treat outpatient basis vandetanib bortezomib , give increase dos four different level determine maximum tolerate dose calculate height weight : - Doses give Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 28-day cycle . - Two additional level ( Level 1A Level 1B ) may include study , depend side effect various level . - Phase II : Patients medullary thyroid cancer divide two group , two patient Group A every one patient Group B . No placebo involve study . - Group A : Patients treat vandetanib bortezomib maximally tolerate dose Phase I study . - Group B : Patients treat bortezomib alone . - A second tumor sample may take . In patient thyroid cancer , second biopsy do 6-week evaluation ( approximately 42 day begin ) . In patient cancer thyroid cancer , second biopsy obtain Day 4 either first second cycle , bortezomib infusion . - The effect drug study blood sample CT scan take various drug cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Targeted Phase I/II Trial ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ; ZACTIMA ) Plus Proteasome Inhibitor , Bortezomib ( Velcade ) , Adults With Solid Tumors With Focus Hereditary Sporadic , Locally Advanced Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer ( MTC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Vandetanib ( CAPRELSA ; ZD6474 ) potently inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) , show additional inhibitory activity sub-micromolar concentration Rearranged Transfection ( RET ) receptor , Flt-4 EGF receptor tyrosine kinase . - Clinical trial show vandetanib active medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTCs ) , activity characterize partial response variable duration , underscore need develop active combinatorial regimen . - Bortezomib ( PS-341 , Velcade ) , proteasome inhibitor , report several putative mechanism action likely toxcitiy mediate affect one pathway target . Bortezomib report inhibit NF-kappaB pathway regulate NF-kappaB-dependent expression several inhibitor apoptosis . - In vitro study show bortezomib active broad range thyroid cancer cell line . Given activity bortezomib role proteasome regulate diverse cellular pathway , study proposes combine bortezomib vandetanib treat patient advance solid tumor focus patient MTC . Objectives : - To assess activity vandetanib plus bortezomib adult MTC , use RECIST tumor biomarkers include CEA calcitonin endpoint . - To assess safety tolerance vandetanib plus bortezomib dose-seeking cohort . - To compare combination bortezomib plus vandetanib versus vandetanib alone adults MTC assess response rate progression-free survival - In exploratory analysis : ( ) examine correlation genotype response therapy patient MTC , ( b ) examine extent , , RET inhibition patient MTC follow administration vandetanib ; ( c ) examine effect , , bortezomib microtubule . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old unresectable , recurrent metastatic solid tumor , include MTC . - Disease must evaluable RECIST . Design : - Phase I dose-escalation study follow randomized phase II trial . - Maximum total number plan enrollment : 117 - Dose-seeking cohort three 6 patient MTD/DLT reach ( 24 patient ) follow randomized phase II trial compare activity combination bortezomib plus vandetanib vandetanib alone ( 2:1 randomization 62 plus 31 equal 93 patient ) . - The MTD DLT determine base toxicity first eight week combine therapy . - Cycle length four week . Response determine RECIST every 12 week .</detailed_description>
