	<brief_summary>Background : More effective therapy need patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose disease advance spread beyond original site follow standard treatment . Talactoferrin genetically engineer form human protein lactoferrin , find body secretion breast milk , tear saliva . In previous study , talactoferrin improve life span patient NSCLC without cause toxic side effect . Objectives : To examine effect talactoferrin immune system determine effectiveness treat NSCLC . Eligibility : Patients advance NSCLC tissue type HLA-A2 whose cancer gotten bad follow least one course treatment . Design : Talactoferrin treatment : Patients take liquid talactoferrin twice day 12 week , follow 2 week drug . Treatment may continue 14-week cycle depend drug side effect response tumor . Evaluations : Patients evaluate clinic physical examination , check vital sign blood test every 3 week . CT scan : Patients CT scan monitor disease start treatment , 6 week 12 week every 12 week duration treatment . Apheresis : Quantities white blood cell call lymphocyte collect procedure call apheresis order measure immune response treatment . In procedure , blood collect needle place vein arm ( similar donate blood ) circulate cell separator machine . The lymphocyte extract rest blood return body needle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Talactoferrin Adults With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients locally advance metastatic NSCLC poor prognosis even surgery , chemotherapy , radiation treatment . Patients respond 1st line chemotherapy invariably develop disease progression , median survival 6-8 month . Talactoferrin alfa ( TLF ) recombinant human lactoferrin . TLF display anti-infective ( bacteria , virus , protozoa fungi ) anti-inflammatory property , anti-tumor activity anti-asthma property . Preclinical study demonstrate increase cytokine stimulate innate adaptive immunity , well increase number NK-T cell CD8+ T-lymphocytes find Peyer Patches . Previous study NSCLC demonstrate safety evidence clinical activity . Objectives : Primary : To evaluate effect administration talactoferrin patient advanced non-small cell lung cancer quantitative functional change CD4 , CD8 , NK , Treg populations peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) level cytokines chemokines serum . Secondary : To evaluate clinical response talactoferrin . To evaluate safety talactoferrin . Eligibility : Patients cytologically histologically confirm progressive , recurrent , refractory stage IIIb IV NSCLC . Patients must HLA-A2 positive . Design : Single-arm pilot study Ten patient enrol receive daily oral talactoferrin ( 1.5 g/ bid ) 12 week . Patients benefit treatment able continue 12 week 2 week schedule progression . Evaluation perform every 3 week CT chest , abdomen , pelvis baseline , week 6 , week 12 . Immunologic study ( include apheresis ) perform baseline , week 6 , week 12 .</detailed_description>
