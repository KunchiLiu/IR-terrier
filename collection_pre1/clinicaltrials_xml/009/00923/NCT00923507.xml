	<brief_summary>Background : The development new technology allow scientist investigate molecular basis clinical manifestation monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis ( MBL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( LPL ) /Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia ( WM ) , splenic marginal zone lymphoma ( SMZL ) . Applying method natural history study clarify process involved disease progression possibly lead discovery validation treatment target . - Objectives : - Study biology natural history MBL/CLL/SLL patient prior time disease require treatment biology LPL/WM SMZL . - Characterize clinical , biologic molecular event disease stability progression patient enrol protocol . - Eligibility : - Diagnosis MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL - Age great equal 18 year . - Patients CLL/SLL must receive previous cytotoxic , monoclonal antibody , kinase inhibitor therapy . - Patients LPL/WM SMZL prior therapy . - ECOG performance status 0-2 . - Design : - Patients typically follow every 6 24 month clinic blood drawn . When required patient may undergo additional testing may include bone marrow biopsy aspiration , blood drawing , lymph node biopsy , x-ray study , positron emission tomography CT MRI scan . Some test may require monitor CLL/SLL , LPL/WM , SMZL patient . Other test , bone marrow biopsy aspiration , lymph node biopsy , may clinically indicate , patient may ask undergo procedure research purpose ) - Clinical information collect stored central databank . - Patients whose cancer require treatment take study treatment option discuss . If NIH treatment protocol available , return care local physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study Monoclonal B Cell Lymphocytosis ( MBL ) , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) , Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma ( LPL ) /Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) , Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma ( SMZL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol collect blood , tissue ( bone marrow lymph node biopsy ) and/or image study ( PET CT scan ) patient monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis ( MBL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( LPL ) /Waldenstr ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) macroglobulinemia ( WM ) , splenic marginal zone lymphoma ( SMZL ) . Assessments use clinical translational research investigate molecular basis MBL , CLL/SLL , LPL/WM , SMZL clinical manifestation . New technology permit simultaneous characterization pathogenic event range control gene expression characterization molecular event cell-cell interaction . Applying method MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL context natural history protocol help unravel cellular pathway involve pathogenesis disease progression lead discovery validation therapeutic target . MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL incurable disease reliable cell line mouse model . There urgent need obtain flow primary sample advance research pathogenesis novel treatment approach . - Eligibility : - Diagnosis MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL - Age great equal 18 year . - Patients CLL/SLL must receive previous cytotoxic , monoclonal antibody , kinase inhibitor therapy . - Patients LPL/WM SMZL prior therapy . - ECOG performance status 0-2 . - Design : Patients typically follow every 6-12 month first 2 year every 12-24 month thereafter . Interim visit may occur discretion research team . Patients may donate cellular product tissue appropriate research purpose . Clinical information obtain stored central databank . - Objectives : - Describe natural history MBL/CLL/SLL patient prior time disease require treatment . - Apply expertise available technology investigator advance understanding disease pathogenesis study MBL/CLL/SLL closely related B-cell malignancy , LPL/WM SMZL - Develop novel treatment approach CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL . - Provide evaluation , diagnostic study monitor patient study . - Provide blood tissue link clinical biologic information translational study . - Endpoints : - In patient CLL/SLL : progression free survival , measure time diagnosis development active disease require treatment time patient able change treatment protocol seek treatment outside NIH . - In patient LPL/WM/SMZL : treatment free survival , measure time last therapy development active disease require treatment time patient able change treatment protocol seek treatment outside NIH .</detailed_description>
