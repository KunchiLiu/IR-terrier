	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 year old . Subjects mean trough seat blood pressure ( SeBP ) ≥ 160/100 mmHg , ( seat systolic blood pressure ( SeSBP ) ≥ 160 mmHg seat diastolic blood pressure ( SeDBP ) ≥ 100 mmHg ) Screening currently antihypertensive medication ( newly diagnose subject subject take antihypertensive medication least 3 week ) ; Or Subjects mean trough SeBP ≥ 160/100 mmHg , SeSBP ≥ 160 mmHg SeDBP ≥ 100 mmHg ) washout prior antihypertensive medication subject discontinue previous antihypertensive medication . The difference mean SeSBP/SeDBP visit prior randomisation randomisation visit must ≤ 20/10 mmHg . Subjects currently antihypertensive ( HTN ) medication may meet requirement screen visit ( Visit 1 ) randomization visit ( Visit 3 ) . Subjects wash HTN medication must meet requirement least Visit 2 ( Visit 2.1 , need ) Visit 3 . All subject undergo washout prior antihypertensive medication opportunity revisit study sit additional visit washout ( Visits 2 2.1 ) ass eligibility randomisation .

Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 3 time ULN . Gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) &gt; 3 time ULN . Potassium ULN ( unless high value due haemolytic blood sample ) . Subjects secondary hypertension aetiology renal disease , phaeochromocytoma , Cushing 's syndrome . Subjects contraindication olmesartan , amlodipine , hydrochlorothiazide , tablet 's excipients . Newly diagnose subject mean trough SeSBP &gt; 200 mmHg mean trough SeDBP &gt; 115 mmHg subject bradycardia ( heart rate &lt; 50 beats/min rest document mean radial pulse rate [ PR ] electrocardiogram [ ECG ] ) Screening ( Visit 1 ) immediately take Period I study medication ( Visit 3 ) . Subjects already take four antihypertensive medication . Subjects mean trough SeSBP &gt; 145 mmHg mean trough SeDBP &gt; 95 mmHg take three antihypertensive medication . Subjects mean trough SeSBP &gt; 160 mmHg mean trough SeDBP &gt; 100 mmHg take two antihypertensive medication . Subjects mean trough SeSBP &gt; 180 mmHg mean trough SeDBP &gt; 110 mmHg take one antihypertensive medication . Subjects electrocardiogram evidence 2nd 3rd degree atrio ventricular ( AV ) block , atrial fibrillation , cardiac arrhythmia ( require treatment ) .
