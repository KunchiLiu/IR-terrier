	<brief_title>Neurophysiological Targets Cognitive Training Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia recognize one lead cause medical disability worldwide , rank 9th overall World Health Organization , affect 2 million Americans per year . There considerable evidence suggest disability status schizophrenia relate directly cognitive Impairment , involve attention , reason , memory , characteristic symptom psychosis . Accordingly , evaluation advancement intervention design restore cognitive function , generally term cognitive remediation , critical importance rehabilitation mission . Recent randomize control trial cognitive remediation schizophrenia find moderate gain cognitive function improve outcome important area community living . However , despite encouraging finding , inference ( 1 ) brain neuroplasticity intact schizophrenia , ( 2 ) training effect adaptive change neural level , ( 3 ) change cognitive test performance occur restoration underlie neural substrate , yet empirically evaluate . This project begin address issue examine effect computer-based cognitive training event-related potential ( ERP ) measure sensory information processing . Two ERP paradigm , mismatch negativity ( MMN ) P300 generation , administer auditory visual modality . MMN P300 study extensively human neuroscience probe sensory echoic memory attention engagement contextually relevant information . Furthermore , reduction MMN P300 generation reliably observe schizophrenia , follow course progressive neuropathological process , correlate severity cognitive impairment . The specific aim study determine : ( 1 ) whether train selectively influence bottom-up ( MMN ) top-down ( P300 ) information processing , ( 2 ) whether train effect modality specific ( auditory vs. visual ) , ( 3 ) whether baseline MMN P300 predict , rate-limit , train progress , ( 4 ) whether pre-post change cognitive test performance mediate neural-level change MMN P300 generation . Answers question provide information need structure cognitive training maximum benefit schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
