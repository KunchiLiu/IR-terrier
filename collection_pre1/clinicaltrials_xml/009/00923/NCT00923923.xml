	<brief_summary>Method : This study design accompaniment already fund study - 12-week treatment trial prazosin patient PTSD AD . The study design consist III phase . In phase I , subject participate three laboratory session determine reactivity stress . Stress reactivity measure use : traumatic experience , stressful non-trauma experience neutral experience , present randomly . Laboratory session conduct outpatient setting . Phase II randomize clinical trial evaluate prazosin versus placebo 12 week double-blind , controlled fashion outpatient set . The treatment last 12 week outcomes include symptom PTSD alcohol use . In phase III , subject participate laboratory session . This phase study conduct least 6 week treatment patient medication ( prazosin placebo ) . Hypotheses : Primary : The investigator hypothesize prazosin effective placebo reduce trauma-related stress reactivity laboratory paradigm , particularly anxiety , crave alcohol , hormonal response , individual PTSD AD . Secondary : The investigator hypothesize stress reactivity moderate effect treatment prazosin , individual high level stress reactivity few heavy drinking day , significant reduction PTSD symptom , short time relapse individual low level stress reactivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : We propose laboratory study examine stress reactivity marker treatment response prazosin patient PTSD AD . Background : Increasing evidence show PTSD AD associate abnormality stress reactivity . In PTSD , increase hormonal response subjective increase affective symptom provide evidence abnormality stress reactivity . In AD , significant increase crave stressful stimulus alcohol cue point abnormality stress response . There increase evidence laboratory paradigm clinically relevant may useful predict treatment outcome patient substance use disorder . Stress induce crave use marker relapse . Individuals great stress reactivity short time relapse prefer substance individual less stress reactivity . Attenuation trauma-related distress may effective reduce crave negative affect individual PTSD AD . In elegant study , Coffey colleague ( Coffey et al , 2006 ) find imaginal exposure therapy effective relaxation alone reduce crave alcohol exposure stressful imagery alcohol cue . However , note intervention imaginal exposure therapy target symptom PTSD , administer highly trained professional provide specialized setting . We propose laboratory study test whether pharmacotherapy target symptoms PTSD AD attenuate stress response , attenuation stress response affect relapse outcome . Method : This study design accompaniment already fund study DOD - 12-week treatment trial prazosin patient PTSD AD . The current proposal augment finding treatment study identify patient prazosin may effective . It important note study different PTSD Coop study study EXCLUDES individual alcohol dependence . The DOD study companion study provide answer relevant alcohol use , alcohol relapse drinking outcome . The study design consist III phase . In phase I , subject participate three laboratory session determine reactivity stress . Stress reactivity measure use : traumatic experience , stressful non-trauma experience neutral experience , present randomly . Laboratory session conduct inpatient setting . Phase II randomize clinical trial evaluate prazosin versus placebo 12 week double-blind , controlled fashion outpatient set . The treatment last 12 week outcomes include symptom PTSD alcohol use . In phase III , subject admit inpatient unit . This phase study conduct 12th final week medication participant still receive prazosin placebo . Hypotheses : Primary : We hypothesize prazosin effective placebo reduce trauma-related stress reactivity laboratory paradigm , particularly anxiety , crave alcohol , hormonal response , individual PTSD AD . And marker treatment response prazosin patient PTSD AD . Secondary : We hypothesize stress reactivity moderate effect treatment prazosin , individual high level stress reactivity few heavy drinking day , significant reduction PTSD symptom , short time relapse individual low level stress reactivity .</detailed_description>
