	<brief_summary>Background : - GC1008 genetically engineer antibody design block activity transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) . Although TGF-beta normal beneficial effect body , often over-produced malignant melanoma tumor , help melanoma grow spread . - Part 1 study enrol 22 subject malignant melanoma kidney cancer determine high safe dose GC1008 , find 15 mg/kg . - Three 22 patient malignant melanoma Part 1 study develop skin problem , know problem related administration GC1008 . Objectives : -To determine frequency adverse skin side effect GC1008 patient malignant melanoma . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old malignant melanoma previous treatment successful . Design : - GC1008 give intravenously ( vein ) dose 15 mg/kg 10 mg/kg four dos study day 0 , 28 , 42 56 ( one treatment cycle ) . Patients whose cancer respond GC1008 may receive one two additional treatment cycle four dos give every two week . - Physical exam vital sign study day 1 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 84 140 . - Vitals sign study day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 84 140 . - Frequent blood sample collection routine safety test , measurement blood level GC1008 , analysis antibody GC1008 research study . - CT MRI scan , bone scan PET CT scan treatment study day 84 140 . - Biopsy apparently normal skin treatment day 84 . - Review medicine well study day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 84 , 112 140 . - Follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year patient receive additional treatment cancer .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFBeta ) member large family evolutionarily conserve protein broad activity . Paradoxically , TGFBeta involve prevent malignant transformation cell promote tumor progression enhance proteolysis extracellular matrix , stimulate tumor cell migration , tumor invasiveness , angiogenesis inhibit immune response tumor . GC1008 human IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralize isoforms TGFBeta . GC1008 reduce metastatic burden enhance immune response cancer preclinical study . OBJECTIVES : To assess maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , safety GC1008 patient locally advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma malignant melanoma . To obtain pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic data GC1008 . To evaluate tumor response preliminary assessment clinical activity . To assess possible surrogate marker might predict clinical efficacy obtain tumor blood sample exploratory biomarker analysis . ELIGIBILITY : Adult patient locally advance , surgically inoperable metastatic renal cell carcinoma malignant melanoma . The Part 2 cohort expansion accrue malignant melanoma patient . Patients must fail great equal 1 prior therapy . Patients must hemoglobin great equal 10.0 gm/dL granulocyte count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/miocroliter platelet great equal 100,000/microliter ; creatinine le equal 2 mg/dL , serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 x ULN , meet criterion AST/ALT normal PT/PTT . Measurable disease RECIST criterion . Patients must test negative hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus human immune deficiency virus ( HIV ) . Patient must great 4-weeks since major surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy . DESIGN : Part 1 : Cohorts 3-6 patient treat single intravenous dose GC1008 dose 0.1 15 mg/kg prescribe protocol ( This part complete ) . Part 2 : A cohort expansion treat additional 6 subject GC1008 15 mg/kg estimate frequency unacceptable skin adverse event ( e.g. , keratoacanthoma , etc ) . If unacceptable frequency skin adverse event observe , additional 6 subject treat low dose 10 mg/kg determine phase II dose . Patients observed adverse event PK study obtain 4-weeks . Patients receive three additional dos GC1008 dose every 2-weeks . Responding patient stable disease may receive additional treatment .</detailed_description>
