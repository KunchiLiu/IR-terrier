	<brief_summary>Background : - It fully understood prostate cancer men become androgen-independent ( long respond anti-androgen medication ) , genetics likely play important role . - Genes contain hereditary information pass parent child . Although everyone set gene , individual different form gene . - Differences gene may explain , least part , people develop aggressive form prostate cancer others . Objectives : -To obtain blood sample patient prostate cancer try identify gene difference associate progression androgen independent state . Eligibility : -All patient participate NCI prostate cancer protocol . Design : - Patients prostate cancer evaluate NCI Medical Oncology Clinic . - Blood sample collect initial visit follow-up visit . - DNA ( genetic material ) white blood cell extract sample use genotyping establishment cell line . - Gene variation correlate prostate cancer prognosis prognostic indicator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : To obtain blood sample patient prostate cancer genotyping analysis . Eligibility : All patient see NCI prostate cancer clinic eligible . Design : Patients prior diagnosis prostate cancer evaluate GMB Clinic , NCI . Blood sample may collect initial visit follow-up visit . Genomic DNA white blood cell extract sample utilized genotyping establishment individual cell line . Genetic variance correlate prostate cancer prognosis ( i.e . time diagnosis death ) prognostic indicator ( i.e . histological tumor grade ) . Healthy control compare correlation make prostate cancer susceptibility .</detailed_description>
