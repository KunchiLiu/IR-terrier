	<brief_summary>This study collect tumor sample people cancer blood , bone marrow , lymph gland laboratory study biology condition . Such study contribute good understanding cancer biology development new treatment . Planned study include : - Examination individual cancer cell search difference compare type cancer normal cell - Examination chromosome gene cancer cell search difference compare type cancer normal cell - Development sensitive method detect small amount cancer remain treatment - Search new cancer protein might serve target treatment - Investigation method develop cancer vaccine . Patients birth 75 year age acute lymphocytic leukemia , acute myelogenous leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , chronic myelogenous leukemia , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , hematologic malignancy may eligible study . Blood bone marrow sample collect sample require patient 's medical care . Cells individual grown test tube , establish cell line animal , establish xenograft model . ( A xenograft transplantation cell one species another specie . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Laboratory-based investigation contribute improved understanding pathophysiology development new therapy hematologic malignancy . The aim protocol facilitate biologic study leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , lymphoma , blood disorder . This sample acquisition protocol target study hematologic malignancy collaborative network NIH investigator multiple Institutes/Centers . Objectives This biology protocol design allow sample acquisition use study hematologic malignancy . A variety laboratory investigation design support NIH translational trial ; apply new methodology study cellular , molecular , genetic , genomic biology ; probe new therapeutic target ; develop new treatment approach perform . Eligibility Diagnosis hematologic malignancy pre-malignant blood disorder , include restrict following : Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL ) , Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) , Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) , Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ) , Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia ( JMML , J-CML ) , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) , Hodgkin Disease Tumor tissue previously collect available study collect minimal additional risk subject sampling require routine patient care . Patient age : birth 75 year . Design Biologic assay relevant investigation hematologic malignancy perform exploratory fashion , study developmental , i.e. , assay design support current plan CC clinical trial . Others standard assay apply attempt identify new target test new therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
