	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Plus Oxaliplatin Adjuvant Chemotherapy Radically Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account large number cancer death annually , worldwide . ( Ferlay et al , 2007 ) Of , 30 % early stage patient ( stage I II ) . For group patient , radical surgery mediastinal lymph node dissection mainstay therapy reasonable curative option . However , 5-year survival rate patient pathologically stag IA-IIB disease range 67 % 39 % . ( Mountain et al , 1997 ) Following surgery , distant recurrence common form relapse eventual cause death . Assuming recurrence due occult micrometastases time surgery , trial adjuvant systemic therapy perform attempt reduce risk recurrence improve survival . In recently publish trial clear benefit adjuvant chemotherapy early stage NSCLC could achieve . ( Tada et al , 2004 ; Scagliott et al , 2003 ; Waller et al , 2004 ) In mark contrast study , three recent , big randomize trial early stage NSCLC patient modern platin-based two-drug chemotherapy-regimens reveal significant advantage overall relapse free survival chemotherapeutically treat patient . ( Arriagada et al , 2004 ; Winton et al , 2005 ; Douillard et al , 2006 ) The majority patient adjuvant treatment set receive combination cisplatin vinorelbine . A pooled analysis five big randomize study demonstrate adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improve survival patient NSCLC ( overall HR death 0.89 , P=0.005 ) correspond 5-year absolute benefit 5.4 % chemotherapy . ( Pignon et al , 2008 ) However , toxicity inadequate dose delivery critical issue trial perform far . Grade 3/4 toxicity observe 73 % rate neutropenic fever 7 % . Up 77 % patient least one dose reduction omission 55 % required one dose delay , relate neutropenia . ( Pisters et al , 2005 ; Winton et al , 2005 ) There data literature soon surgery patient begin adjuvant chemotherapy , although trial seem start post-surgical interval 4-6 week . A recent study report 26 patient , underwent thoracoscopic ( video-assisted thoracic surgery , VATS ) lobectomy , receive chemotherapy , 73 % complete full course schedule 85 % receive intended cycle . ( Nicastri et al , 2008 ) In another study , complete resection perform thoracotomy 43 patient thoracoscopy 57 patient , compare thoracotomy , patient undergo thoracoscopic lobectomy significantly few delay ( 18 % versus 58 % , P &lt; 0.001 ) reduce ( 26 % versus 49 % , P = 0.02 ) chemotherapy dos . A high percentage patient undergo thoracoscopic resection receive 75 % plan adjuvant regimen without delayed reduce dos ( 61 % versus 40 % , P = 0.03 ) . There significant difference time initiation chemotherapy toxicity . ( Peterson et al , 2007 ) In comparison , Cancer Leukemia Group B trial 9633 report 57 % patient receive full-dose chemotherapy ( Strauss et al , 2008 ) Intergroup JBR.10 trial report 55 % patient least 1 dose delay . ( Winton et al , 2005 ) Approximately 34 % patient Adjuvant Lung Project Italy series chemotherapy wing receive scheduled dos without adjustment delay ; 69 % complete treatment without adjustment delay . ( Scagliotti et al , 2003 ) It conceivable patient undergo VATS may quicker recovery general strength tolerate chemotherapy . There theoretic survival benefit start chemotherapy immediately surgery body 's tumor burden low , tumor growth fast , time . Thus , chemotherapy administer immediately post-surgery would effective , assume wound heal adequate . ( Nicastri et al , 2008 ) Pemetrexed , multi-target folate antimetabolite , show clear activity non-small cell lung cancer . In phase III study patient previously treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer , efficacy single-agent pemetrexed , determine overall survival , similar docetaxel . ( Hanna et al , 2004 ) The combination oxaliplatin pemetrexed particular interest demonstrate good efficacy tolerable side effect profile . Oxaliplatin diaminocyclohexane-containing platinum compound inhibit DNA replication transcription form DNA adduct . Its mechanism action similar classic platinum drug , molecular pharmacology study suggest oxaliplatin represent distinct family platinum compound . It different cytotoxicity profile cisplatin safely give outpatient set without hydration therapy . ( Raymond et al , 1998 ) Moreover , oxaliplatin appear interact synergistically pemetrexed . ( Raymond et al , 2002 ) Phase I study evaluate pemetrexed plus oxaliplatin patient solid tumor , show regimen efficacious well tolerate . ( Misset et al , 2004 ) The combination oxaliplatin pemetrexed compare carboplatin pemetrexed first-line therapy advance NSCLC randomize phase II study . Response rate 27 33 % , respectively , statistically different . However , toxicity oxaliplatin/pemetrexed arm quite low , doublet deliver easily well tolerate . Furthermore , result 7.3 % rate grade 3/4 neutropenia incidence febrile neutropenia 2.4 % . Dose reduction occur 2.6 % cycle . Patients receive 95.3 % 100 % planned weekly mean dos pemetrexed oxaliplatin , respectively . ( Scagliotti et al , 2005 ) Therefore , seem reasonable test less toxic regimen also early stage complete ( R0 ) resection tumor , reduce toxicity might improve feasibility drug delivery , compliance convenience treatment patient hence perhaps improve survival . The main purpose phase II trial evaluate clinical feasibility-in term patient without dose limit toxicity premature treatment withdrawal death-of administering adjuvant chemotherapy pemetrexed follow pemetrexed/oxaliplatin immediately post-VATS patient completely resect NSCLC .</detailed_description>
