	<detailed_description>Single site , exploratory , comparative , double-blind , randomised , cross-over study . Three physician involve conduct study : - Physician 1 include randomise subject , prepare administer study product ( namely Investigational Medicinal Products ( IMPs ) ) open manner ass subject safety . - Physician 2 , keep IMP blind , perform evaluation measurement sedation assessment experimental session . Physician 2 always person throughout whole study period . - Physician 3 available need reinforce subject safety Design : A group 20 assessable subject undergo 4 randomised experimental session CCES 4 separate study day , 2 week apart precede 2 week period selection first experimental session follow 1 week period last experimental session study end . After selection visit , visit correspond one 4 experimental session name A , B , C , D differ gas mixture inhale intravenous medicine administer . The order experimental session A , B , C , D , assign accord pre-established list investigator know . Each experimental session include set-up-phase follow evaluation phase . The set phase last 20 mn electrical stimulation generate spontaneous pain : every 2 minute electrical stimulation increase subject ask rate pain visual scale 0 100 . When stable level pain intensity reach , regimen electrical stimulation keep constant end experimental session . The Evaluation phase last 160 mn : electrical stimulation constant 160 mn detail . During phase subject inhale gas mixture face mask 60 minute combine intravenous administration medicine 30 mn start time . Every 5 minute subject ask rate pain predefined time spontaneous pain area allodynia hyperalgesia measure record well safety parameter ( transcutaneous oxygen saturation , respiratory parameter , sedation score , blood pressure heart rate ) . The 4 experimental session name A , B , C , D differ gas mixture inhale intravenous medicine administer . For placebo session , inhale gas mixture 50 % /50 % N2/O2 intravenous administration isotonic saline solution . For three session , inhale gas mixture differ session one ( 35 % /15 % /50 % N2O/N2/O2 50 % /50 % N2/O2 50 % /50 % N2O/O2 ) , remifentanil administer intravenously session .</detailed_description>
