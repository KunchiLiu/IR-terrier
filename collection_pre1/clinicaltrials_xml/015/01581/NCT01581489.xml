	<brief_summary>Delayed clamp umbilical cord might prevent slow onset iron deficiency increase infant 's iron endowment birth . Compared early clamping , delay clamp clamp around 2-3 min provide additional 25-40 mL blood per kg bodyweight newborn infant . The result previous intervention study delay clamp mixed , follow infant beyond perinatal period . All longer follow study perform low income country except investigator earlier study , show less iron deficiency improve iron store delay cord clamp 4 month age . The main objective current study ass whether time cord clamp affect neurodevelopment 4 year age large sample full-term , Swedish infant . The investigator hypothesis delay cord clamp improves iron store 4 month , could affect child 's development positively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project description Iron deficiency associate neurodevelopmental delay suboptimal cognitive function . Our hypothesis early cord clamp associate increased risk iron deficiency , consequence increase risk suboptimal infant development also country high standard living . - Method 1 . Study cohort Four-hundred full-term infant , bear healthy mother normal pregnancy , randomize early delayed cord clamping ( hospital practice early cord clamp standard practice ) . The infant bear time-period April 2008 May 2009 . Pregnant woman consider eligible met follow criterion : non-smoking , healthy mother ( haemolytic disease , treatment follow drug : anticonvulsant , antidepressant , thyroid hormone , insulin , chemotherapy cortisone ) , normal pregnancy ( preeclampsia , diabetes , prolonged rupture membrane sign infection ) , single birth , term pregnancy ( gestational age 37 +0 41 +6 week + day ) , expect vaginal delivery cephalic presentation . Furthermore , mother able master Swedish well enough understand meaning study . Mothers give write oral information trial maternal health care centre 34 week gestational age . Mothers fulfil inclusion criterion time admission delivery ward give write oral information study attend midwife write informed consent obtain . Randomization perform advance computer block 20 . When delivery imminent , midwife open seal envelope contain treatment allocation . The intervention early cord clamping ( ECC ) group consist double clamp umbilical cord within 10 second infant 's delivery , arterial venous blood sample clamp segment within 10 min . The intervention delay cord clamping ( DCC ) group consist late ( â‰¥ 180 ) clamp umbilical cord arterial venous blood sampling unclamped cord within 30 second birth , midwife hold child level uterus . In randomization group , child initially keep 20 cm level mother 's uterus 30 second place mother 's chest . All aspect obstetric care labour delivery manage accord standard practice care study hospital . Oxytocin administered mother immediately cord clamp . The final participating mother-infant pair available statistical analysis 189 ECC group 193 DCC group . 2 . Follow 4 year age Children ask return follow 4 year age neuro-developmental test include : - Cognitive testing WPPSI ( Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale Intelligence ) - Behavioral assessment SDQ ( Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire ) , questionnaire behavioural screening fill parent - Assessment psychomotor development ASQ ( Ages Stages Questionnaire ) , questionnaire fill parent - Selected item Movement ABC ( Assessment Battery Children ) Time plan The included child born time period April 2008 May 2009 , become 4 year 2012 2013 . We aim test age 4 year ( April 2012 May 2013 ) . Additional research ethic permission follow approve . Permission translate use Ages Stages Questionnaire ( ASQ ) scientific purpose , seek publisher Brooks Publishing ( already approve previous version 4 , 12 36 month age ) . - Realization At approximately one month child 's fourth birthday , parent receive letter contain information study , include time location test , two questionnaire , SDQ ASQ . The parent ask answer questionnaire visit psychologist . The parent also inform plan neurodevelopmental testing questionnaires 4 year age another scheduled visit child three year age . The parent opportunity contact research assistant change time visit . After neurodevelopmental testing , parent receive write report , abnormal result discover , due action take .</detailed_description>
