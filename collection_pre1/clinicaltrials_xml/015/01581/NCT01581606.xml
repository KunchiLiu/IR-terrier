	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The use teleophthalmology patient screen result rapid patient access treatment . The use teleophthalmology monitor patient wet AMD post-treatment result maintenance good visual outcome combine reduction patient travel improve patient satisfaction cost effective manner . Objectives : The Evaluation Teleophthalmology AMD project objectives follow : 1 . To evaluate efficacy teleophthalmology screen patient refer retina specialist suspect wet AMD . 2 . To compare `` time treatment/retreatment '' program patient 's entering system follow conventionally determine efficacy teleophthalmology provide rapid entry/re-entry treatment program . 3 . To determine efficacy teleophthalmology monitoring patient wet AMD post therapy . 4 . To determine compliance rate monitoring wet AMD follow-up utilize teleophthalmology . 5 . To evaluate cost effectiveness teleophthalmology screening/monitoring wet AMD patient include direct cost OHIP system indirect cost patient/caregiver . 6 . To assess patient satisfaction teleophthalmology versus standard clinical care monitor post-treatment wet AMD . 7 . To evaluate teleophthalmology tool communication community base Optometrists /Ophthalmologists Retina Specialists .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For purpose study , two patient stream develop implement : AMD screen patient ( Group 1 ) post-Lucentis monitoring patient ( Group 2 ) . Group 1 patient collect referral physician investigator provisional diagnosis possible wet AMD . Any request clinical evaluation patient presume wet AMD randomize Group 1R ( Routine Screening ) Group 1T ( Tele-ophthalmology screening ) . In group 1R patient receive appointment current standard fashion review consultation within retinal physician 's office , evaluation need diagnostic test subsequent treatment indicate . Group 1T undergo pre-screening near OHC . These patient obtain full ocular evaluation current OTN ( Ontario Telemedicine Network ) ophthalmology pilot standard ( visual acuity , intraocular pressure measurement , fundus photography OCT - quality level establish work group OTN 2009 ) . At completion screen visit , image data store OHC database notification visit send treat center . This trigger formal evaluation grade patient 's status determination need person evaluation treatment treat center . This formal evaluation occur teleophthalmology dataset suggest presence wet AMD require treatment dataset quality insufficient allow accurate determination need treat . In group follow consultation , full report patient generate document patient 's current macular status suggest management strategy . Group 2 patient collected patient previously treat wet AMD within practice physician investigator . All patient disease inactive ( receive active treatment ) therefore require monitor randomize Group 2R ( Routine Monitoring ) Group 2T ( Teleophthalmology Monitoring ) . As group 1 , patient Group 2T obtain full ocular evaluation current OTN ( Ontario Telemedicine Network ) ophthalmology pilot standard , group 1 , data analyze determine need retreatment . If necessary , patient recall treat center . Those meet requirement retreatment book reassessment two month . The two month follow period , although long `` gold standard '' , routine employ clinically time across province . This due current OHIP rule cover cost associated OCT maximum 6 per year desire limit pocket expense patient incur . The follow period two month standard group 2T 2R . Group 2R patient review person evaluation standard fashion obtain visual acuity , fundus photography OCT within investigator clinic receive treatment follow consultation need date visit . Data collect , store , transmitted secure password protect manner appropriate encryption . Data obtain include participant age , sex , number type prior AMD treatment , current driving status , distance site residence screen treatment site respectively . Data answer objective 2 obtain research coordinator study entry include duration visual symptom , time ( week ) initiation symptom initial assessment visit time ( week ) initial assessment screen visit determine treatment eligibility ) , time monitor visit treatment , number visit require treatment ( deem `` avoidable '' ) . The study include short , post screen visit patient satisfaction questionnaire ass perceive patient satisfaction screening/monitoring process answer objective 6 . In patient follow treatment , additional demographic office vitreoretinal surgeon collect include baseline visual acuity , prior treatment ( eye number treatment ) . Data collect document patient compliance schedule visit , time evaluation , image quality/adequacy perceive grade physician , recurrent disease activity recurrence rate , time assessment visit treatment applicable . Patients also administer short patient satisfaction survey regard duration visit , park / facility access , perceive satisfaction clinic OHC visit . These questionnaire do discharge hospital system , completion first OHC visit end 1 year follow .</detailed_description>
