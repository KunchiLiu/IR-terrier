	<brief_title>Studies Immune Response Vaccination After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy potentially curative many malignant non-malignant hematopoietic disorder . Disease recurrence infection remain major cause morbidity mortality follow HSCT . While innate immunity ( myeloid NK cell ) restore relatively quickly follow HSCT , prolong period lymphopenia occur patient . This delay lymphoid reconstitution exacerbate age result severely dampen adaptive immune response . In child receive chemotherapy HSCT , T cell function generally recovers within 6 twelve month . In contrast , lymphoid deficiency adult may require year , often never recovers pre-transplant level . Much delay lymphocyte recovery think due decrease thymic T cell production export result expansion treatment resistant T cell clone . Peripheral expansion T cell lymphopenic set lead narrow TCR repertoire manifest decrease magnitude response new antigen . These long-lasting T cell deficiency show play direct role post-transplant complication . There many study correlate decrease T cell number function ( specifically CD4+ T cell ) increase post-transplant infection relapse show inversely proportional T cell reconstitution follow autologous allogeneic HSCT . Furthermore , prolong deficit T cell function decrease effectiveness vaccination tumour antigens infectious disease well post-transplant immunotherapeutic strategy . Following HSCT , patient lose immunological memory infectious microorganism previously expose also bacterial viral vaccine give prior HSCT , increase chance infection post-transplant . Primary immunization require antigenic stimulation functionally mature T cell therefore least partial reconstitution T B cell pool necessary successful reimmunization occur . This study present opportunity analyze , system level , response vaccination patient treat HSCT . The expected high frequency low responder vaccination permit comparison gene expression immune cell activation high low responder measure rate seroconversion HAI titer . The evaluation live VZV vaccination essential objective investigator hypothesize live vaccination induce specific immune response dead ( ie : influenza ) vaccination . This study may also generate novel hypothesis mechanistic basis reduce response vaccine post HSCT .</detailed_description>
