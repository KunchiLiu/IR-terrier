	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Kedrion IVIG 10 % Treat Subjects With Primary Immunodeficiency ( PID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People primary immunodeficiency disease ( PID ) defective immune system experience recurrent protozoal , bacterial , fungal viral infection . Antibody deficiency make large group PIDs . The standard care patient PID replacement immunoglobulin ( class antibody ) solution . Prophylactic treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) solution show increase time free serious infection . Kedrion IVIG 10 % new preparation immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) solution . Kedrion IVIG 10 % give IV infusion study participant . The data collect help determine whether Kedrion IVIG 10 % suitable treat PID subject .</detailed_description>
