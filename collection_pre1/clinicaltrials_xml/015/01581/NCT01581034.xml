	<detailed_description>Background This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial investigates effect 6 week intake PADMA 28 endothelial function , biomarkers autonomic nervous system patient coronary artery disease . PADMA 28 contains 20 herb Tibet . The endothelial function measure EndoPAT 2000 , autonomic nervous system ambulatory electrocardiography orthostatic reaction biomarkers analyze take blood sample . The investigator hypothesize PADMA 28 beneficial effect endothelial function , arterial stiffness , autonomic nervous systen blood inflammatory marker patient coronary artery disease compare placebo treatment . Objective To assess effect PADMA 28 endothelial function , autonomic nervous system biomarkers patient coronary artery disease . Methods 80 patient coronary artery disease recruit study . To measure endothelial function , investigator use EndoPAT 2000 . The autonomic nervous system analyse ambulatory electrocardiography .</detailed_description>
