	<brief_summary>Background : - PU-H71 experimental drug use treat cancer . It work block protein tumor . When protein block , affect protein inside cell cancer need grow . Researchers want study whether PU-H71 safe effective way treat solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness PU-H71 solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor non-Hodgkin lymphoma respond standard treatment . Design : - Patients screen physical exam , medical history , blood test , image study . - Patients receive PU-H71 1-hour dose day 1 8 21-day cycle treatment . The first treatment cycle do hospital patient monitor . The next treatment cycle do outpatient basis . - Patients blood urine test eye exam . - Patients provide tumor sample study . - Patients image study monitor tumor response treatment . - Patients continue take PU-H71 long side effect remain tolerable tumor lymphoma worsen . Study researcher may adjust dose need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PU-H71 Patients With Solid Tumors Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma That Have Not Responded Standard Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : -PU-H71 synthetic HSP90 inhibitor bind open close conformation HSP90 . It demonstrate extended tumor retention client protein degradation , rapidly clear normal tissue . It show complete tumor response retain sensitivity retreatment vivo . Primary Objectives : - To establish safety tolerability PU-H71 administer weekly , 2 week 3 schedule , patient refractory solid tumor lowgrade non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . - To establish MTD RP2D PU-H71 administer weekly , 2 week 3 schedule , patient refractory solid tumor low-grade NHL . - To determine pharmacokinetics PU-H71 administer weekly , 2 week 3 schedule , patient refractory solid tumor low-grade NHL . Secondary Objectives : - To perform pharmacodynamic study ascertain PU-H71 effect HSP70 tumor tissue , serum , PBMCs MTD . - To perform pharmacodynamic study ascertain PU-H71 effect HSP90 client protein tumor tissue MTD . Eligibility : -Study participant must histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma progress recur least one line chemotherapy standard treatment option exist ; therapy within 4 week prior enter study ; age great equal 18 year ; ECOG le equal 2 ; life expectancy &gt; 3 month ; adequate organ marrow function . Patients enter expansion cohort MTD must disease amenable biopsy willingness undergo pre- post-treatment biopsy . Study Design : - This study follow modify accelerated titration design ( Simon et al. , 1997 ) . - The accelerated phase end 1 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity 2 patient experience Grade 2 drug-related toxicity first cycle ; study follow standard 3 + 3 design . - PU-H71 administer intravenously one hour , weekly , 2 week 3 , ( i.e. , day 1 8 ) every 21 day . - PK PD study conduct cycle 1 . Up 10 additional patient enter MTD define toxicity perform PD study dose ; pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy mandatory patient . - CT scan perform baseline every 2 cycle ( 6 week ) restaging . - Up 100 patient may treat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) solid tumor malignancy lowgrade nonHodgkin lymphoma metastatic unresectable , standard curative measure exist , whose disease progress recur follow least one line standard therapy . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients must complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy great equal 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug Phase 0 study ( also refer prePhase I study subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . Patients receive bisphosphonates cancer eligible participate . Age great equal 18 year . An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; OR Measured creatinine great equal 60 mL/minute patient clearance creatinine level great equal 1.5 time ULN The effect PUH71 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month completion study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour enrollment order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , treat physician notify immediately . Because unknown potential risk nursing infant secondary treatment mother PUH71 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated PUH71 . During expansion phase protocol , patient must : Disease amenable biopsy Willingness undergo pre posttreatment tumor biopsy Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 3 month treatment brain metastasis . Patients clinically significant intercurrent illness , include limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . QTc &gt; 450 msec men &gt; 470 msec woman . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential PK interaction PUH71 . Pregnant woman ineligible effect PUH71 develop human fetus unknown . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treat PUH71 since unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant .</criteria>
