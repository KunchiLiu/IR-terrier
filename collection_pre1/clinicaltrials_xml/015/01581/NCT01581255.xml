	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation , although life-saving , damage lung know ventilator-induced lung injury . High frequency oscillation ventilation propose ventilation method may less injurious lung conventional mechanical ventilation may lead good patient outcomes . To evaluate hypothesis , OSCILLATE trial compare outcome patient acute respiratory distress syndrome randomize high frequency oscillation ventilation v conventional lung protective ventilation . The present study substudy OSCILLATE trial look biomarkers ventilator-induced lung injury blood sample draw patient enrolled OSCILLATE . The objective look biochemical evidence decrease ventilator-induced lung injury patient treat high frequency oscillation ventilation relative conventional ventilation .</brief_summary>
