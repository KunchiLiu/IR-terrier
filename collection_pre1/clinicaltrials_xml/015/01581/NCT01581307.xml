	<criteria>Patients must metastatic pancreatic cancer predominantly liver metastatic disease ( &gt; 50 % ) , determine principal investigator ( PI0 refer medical oncologist progress gemcitabinebased chemotherapy . Patients solitary , multifocal unilobar , bilobar disease . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 No prior radiation embolization liver ChildsPugh score ≤ 7 Lung shunt predicts lung dose ≤ 30 Gy single treatment The effect TheraSpheres develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason radioactive sphere know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Adequate baseline hematopoietic function : total white blood cell count equal great 3,000/mm^3 absolute granulocyte count great 1,500/mm^3 platelet count equal great 50,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 Patients currently receive investigational agent Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant woman exclude study TheraSpheres radioactive radiation know agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother TheraSpheres , breastfeed discontinue mother treated TheraSpheres . Initiation secondline chemotherapy consist FOLFOX Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . In addition , antiretrovirals know radiation sensitizer could dramatically increase risk fulminant hepatic failure . Therefore , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient exclude study possible lethal side effect . Bulk disease ( tumor volume &gt; 70 % target liver volume ) Aspartic transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL ChildPugh score &gt; 7 Tumor volume &gt; 50 % liver combine albumin &lt; 3 g/dL Complete occlusion main portal vein cause portal hypertension</criteria>
