	<brief_title>Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ( ARFI ) Ultrasound Noninvasive , Diagnostic Atherosclerosis Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ( ARFI ) ultrasound image describe composition structure atherosclerotic plaque . The surgical atherosclerotic plaque 16 patient volunteer undergo clinically indicate carotid endarterectomy ( surgical removal plaque carotid artery ) image preoperatively ARFI . ARFI image occur volunteer ' preoperative workup visit ( inpatient outpatient ) , surgical hold area ( inpatient outpatient ) , patient bedside ( inpatient ) . Then , routinely excise plaque specimen send histopathological processing determine plaque composition structure . The histopathological data use validate ARFI image performance plaque material structural characterization . This end participant 's involvement study . There two experimental component study beyond standard practice carotid endarterectomy patient : 1 ) preoperative ARFI ultrasound image ipsilateral ( surgical ) carotid artery , 2 ) submission section carotid plaque excise intraoperatively UNC Hospitals clinical laboratory immunohistochemical analysis . This study commence ARFI ultrasound image time patient volunteer 's preoperative workup carotid endarterectomy surgery ( outpatient inpatient ) , patient hold area surgery ( outpatient inpatient ) , patient bedside ( inpatient ) . If patient volunteer outpatient , ARFI ultrasound image perform two week prior surgery . Preoperative ARFI ultrasound image perform addition patient volunteer 's routine preoperative duplex ultrasound exam use determine carotid endarterectomy clinically indicate . ARFI ultrasound noninvasive diagnostic imaging technology perform use commercially available clinical ultrasound image equipment - Siemens SONOLINE Acuson Antares image system equip research purpose VF10-5 VF7-3 linear array transducer ( Siemens Medical Solutions , USA Inc. Ultrasound Division ) . ARFI image carry professional sonographer train peripheral vascular ultrasound faculty ( Caterina Gallippi , Ph.D. , Associate Professor , study PI ) and/or graduate student research assistants UNC-CH Joint Department Biomedical Engineering . The sonographer acquire ARFI ultrasound data match B-Mode ( anatomical reference ) ipsilateral ( surgical ) carotid artery patient volunteer . Patient volunteer ask lie examination table ( outpatient ) remain hospital bed ( inpatient ) . The head exam table/bed may raise approximate 45 degree angle best visualize carotid artery ultrasound image . Once patient volunteer position , ultrasound gel apply patient volunteer 's neck . The ultrasound imaging transducer place top gel . Once carotid artery locate , ARFI ultrasound image begin . In ipsilateral ( surgical ) carotid artery , image field view center carotid plaque , axial focal depth direct position near far wall contain thick portion plaque . Data acquisition gate diastole . Two repeat acquisition acquire four ARFI image sequence . The position landmarks arterial branch point morphological feature arterial wall thickness record spatial registration duplex ultrasound histology . The length time ARFI data collection carotid artery estimate less 30 minute . Once ipsilateral ( surgical ) carotid artery image , study procedure complete first portion study . For second part study , section carotid plaque specimen routinely extract carotid endarterectomy surgery photograph fix paraffin embed UNC Tissue Procurement core facility . The specimen undergo section stain UNC Histopathology core facility . These experimental section addition section routinely send immunohistochemical processing carotid endarterectomy . Sectioning direct surgeon per standard histopathology protocol per laboratory sample protocol . The section stain hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) baseline , Verhoeff van Giesen ( VVG ) elastin , Sirius Red ( SR ) polarize light microscopy collagen sub-types I III , von Kossa ( VK ) calcium , and/or Lillie modification Masson 's trichrome ( MT ) fibrin , comparable stain . This conclude part two study . However , excise plaque specimen store Dr. Gallippi 's ( PI ) laboratory period five year follow study completion . Their storage enable re-sectioning need achieve proper spatial alignment ARFI imaging . The stored specimen use future research ; verification purpose . The specimen submerge formalin store seal plastic container . No identifiable information record sample , HIPAA guideline procedure observe . Patient volunteer ' participation end study part one ( ARFI ultrasound image ) two ( immunohistochemical processing excise plaque specimen ) complete . Therefore , follow-up visit require additional demand place patient volunteer . A Patient volunteer ask consent ( 1 ) ARFI ultrasound image his/her ipsilateral ( surgical ) carotid arteries his/her clinically indicated endarterectomy surgery , ( 2 ) section his/her routinely excised plaque specimen undergo immunohistochemical processing ( addition section routinely send immunohistochemical processing carotid endarterectomy ) . No additional procedure requirement propose . Every aspect volunteer ' preoperative workup surgery endarterectomy surgery carry normal standard care clinically indicate . There control group study . This pilot study determine ARFI ultrasound image patient population may relevant delineate composition structure carotid plaques immunohistochemical validation .</detailed_description>
