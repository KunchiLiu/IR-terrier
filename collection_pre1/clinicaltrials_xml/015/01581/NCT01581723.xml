	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer common urological malignant disease . Patients bladder cancer first manage transurethral resection ( TUR ) bladder tumor . For many year , monopolar transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURP ) gold standard treatment . However , complication include bleeding , bladder perforation inadequate sampling deep tumor biopsy remain major concern . Recently publish paper suggest new bipolar TUR technology similar surgical outcome less complication compare monopolar TUR . In study , investigator investigate benefit new technology compare conventional monopolar resection tumor clearance , complication recurrence rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Using Bipolar Technology Transurethral Resection Bladder Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transurethral resection ( TUR ) bladder tumor one commonest procedures urology practice . It surgery choice stag treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . Short lengths hospital stay , simple safe main advantage surgery . Conventional TUR perform monopolar diathermy , commonly elicit obturator reflex lateral-located tumor . However , without complication . Bleeding bladder perforation without obturator reflex significant complication TUR bladder tumor . The char effect monopolar also concern diagnosis muscle invasion tumor determine integrity tumor base biopsy . Mariappan et al . report high 33 % specimen detrusor muscle present assessment . The absent muscle affect stag procedure also associate high cancer recurrence rate . Bipolar resection widely use transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) . As compare traditional monopolar technology , electric current pass instrument sheath . The advantage bipolar technology include less obturator reflex , good hemostasis early recovery . Study show cautery artifact severe monopolar resection compare bipolar prostate tissue . Due clean precise cutting , less char specimen thermal injury peripheral tissue . Applying bladder tumor resection , improve stag accuracy good determination depth invasion . Furthermore , use saline instead glycine irrigation fluid , risk TUR syndrome minimize . There randomized trial benefit use bipolar instrument TUR bladder cancer . In study , investigator investigate role bipolar technology TUR bladder cancer compare traditional monopolar resection .</detailed_description>
