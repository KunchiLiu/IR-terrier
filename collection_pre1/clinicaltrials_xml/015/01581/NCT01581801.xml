	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Geltrude Mingrone , Simona Panunzi , Andrea De Gaetano , Caterina Guidone , Celestino Pio Lombardi , Marco Raffaelli , Rocco Bellantone Departments Internal Medicine , Surgery Biomathematics Catholic University Rome , Italy The overall prevalence grade 2 3 adult obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) derive 2009-2010 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) exceed 15 % grade 3 obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) account 6.3 % ( 1 ) . The dietary approach modestly satisfactory short term weight regain practically rule long run consequence scarce compliance diet show obese subject . In fact , recent study ( 2 ) different type diet assign population overweight obese subject ( BMI 25 40 kg/m2 ) , average 6 kg , correspond 7 % initial body weight , lose first 6 month , weight regain 1 year 2 year , 31-37 % participant lose 5 % initial weight . Bariatric surgery long recognize effective treatment grade 3 grade 2 obesity associate complication ( 3 ) , accordingly , number bariatric operation United States grow time ca . 10,000 early 1990s 103,000 2003 ( 4 ) . Bariatric surgery allow type 2 diabetes remission ( 5,6 ) improve several serious comorbidities ( 7 ) . Among bariatric surgical procedure , roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) show account 41 % bariatric operation least United Sates ( 8 ) . Sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) , conceive first step perform RYGB biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch patient super-obese ( 9 ) , recently emerge new restrictive bariatric procedure ( 10 ) . It notice SG determines weight loss similar achieve RYGB ( 11 ) large follow laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( 12,13 ) . Reactive hypoglycemia late complication RYGB although seem occur also SG . After RYGB insulin secretion enhance early oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ( 14 ) meal ( 15,16 ) might explain later reactive hypoglycemia . An increase number report highlight occurrence severe hypoglycemia RYGB include neuroglycopenia attribute nesidioblastosis ( 17-20 ) . Roslin et al ( 21 ) find 72 % , i.e . 26 36 patient operate RYGB 6 month earlier , reactive hypoglycemia 2 hour OGTT ( 100 g glucose ) , define `` absolute serum glucose level ≤60 mg/dL , drop 100 mg/dL serum glucose level 1 h '' . As compare RYGB , SG seem much low occurrence reactive hypoglycemia , ca . 3 % , i.e . 1 31 patient study 6 week operation ( 22 ) . Fortunately , frequency severe hypoglycemia relate symptom require hospitalization RYGB pretty low , adjust hazard ratio fact 2.7 hypoglycemia , 2.8 confusion , 4.9 syncope , 3.0 epilepsy 7.3 seizure ( 23 ) Swedish cohort study base national registry 5,040 operated person ( 23 ) . However , prospective study investigate incidence hypoglycemia RYGB randomize study undertaken compare effect SG RYGB term incidence hypoglycemic episode . The primary aim present study conduct 1-year randomized trial compare incidence hypoglycemia RYGB SG . STUDY OBJECTIVE Primary objective The primary objective study verify whether SG decrease percentage patient present reactive hypoglycemia respect RYGB within 1 year bariatric operation . Secondary objective - To quantify relative contribution change insulin sensitivity insulin secretion measure OGTT glycemic effect bariatric surgery determine difference exist two surgical treatment . - To determine whether treatment associate body weight , BMI abdominal circumference loss body composition , assess DEXA , well lipid profile cardiovascular system abnormality . - To assess occurrence severe hypoglycemia relate symptom ( shakiness , sweat , dizziness light-headedness , confusion , difficulty speaking , weakness , confusion , syncope , epilepsy , seizure ) within 5 year operation determine whether SG decrease incidence . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Study End-points Primary End-point The Primary Endpoint study incidence reactive hypoglycemia 1 year bariatric surgery . Secondary End-points - Changes 1 year insulin sensitivity insulin secretion measure OGTT . - Changes 1 year body weight , BMI , abdominal circumference , body composition , lipid profile cardiovascular system abnormality . - incidence severe hypoglycemia relate symptom ( shakiness , sweat , dizziness light-headedness , confusion , difficulty speaking , weakness , confusion , syncope , epilepsy , seizure ) within 5 year operation . Experimental plan This monocentric prospective control randomized clinical trial design investigate SG reduces incidence reactive hypoglycemia respect RYGB within 1 year bariatric operation . At moment Screening visit subject randomize undergone either SG RYGB surgical procedure . Study Design diagram The diagram study plan follow : Screening Visit ( -18 week ) Baseline Visit ( -4 week ) Follow-up Visit ( +1 month ) Follow-up Visit ( +3 month ) Follow-up Visit ( +6 month ) Follow-up Visit ( +9 month ) Follow-up Visit ( +12 month ) Written informed consent Demographic Data Medical surgical history Physical examination† Height weight , BMI waist hip circumference DEXA blood pressure heart rate ECG laboratory assessment OGTT adverse event record concomitant medication An overview plan blood sample , include volume purpose provide Table 2 . Study duration Subjects study time Screening Visit 1 year surgical procedure undergo four distinct phase : - Screening visit ( week -18 ) - Baseline visit ( week -4 ) - A follow-up period surgical treatment ( 1 year duration , month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) - A follow-up period study conclusion ( 4 year duration ) Screening Visit At week -18 , eligible patient identify Written informed consent obtain . Demographic data , anthropometric measure , physical examination information medical history , concomitant medication variable relate inclusion criterion collect . Basal Visit At week -4 patient screen visit ask return baseline visit ask give informed consent randomization . Study compliance assess screen baseline period use attendance appointment completion questionnaire . Baseline anthropometric measure , body composition , blood pressure , biochemical data ( level fast plasma glucose , glycated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] , C-peptide , serum insulin , lipid profile oral glucose tolerance test ) measure . Follow-up Period One month bariatric surgery 3 month 1 year surgical treatment ( month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) collect variable baseline record OGTT perform . Adverse event record follow-up visit . Study conclusion follow-up period At conclusion study conclusion form fill patient follow 5 year surgical treatment . STUDY POPULATION Sample size The sample size depend magnitude difference reactive hypoglycemia incidence derive previous study ( 21 ) ( 22 ) . The study design detect conservative absolute difference occurrence hypoglycemia 50 % , expect incidence 70 % RYGB group versus incidence 20 % SG group . A sample size 19 patient per group would require clinical trial detect improvement data significance level 0.05 power 0.90 . Considering attrition rate 25 % course study total 50 subject ( 25 group ) enrol . An amendment enlarge number patient 120 , 60 arm , approve Ethical Committee November 2012 . For conservative estimate fact , reduce percent difference two group 50 % 30 % consider incidence reactive hypoglycemia 50 % RYGB 20 % SG instead 70 % 20 % respectively . In way , number patient allocate arm 50 power 90 % . Considering attrition rate 20 % number patient group 60 , thus , overall 120 . Secondary endpoint CGM insulin sensitivity secretion evaluate subset 50 patient , 25 Group , also extend entire sample .
