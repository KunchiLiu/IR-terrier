	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) important investigation tool obtain tissue diagnosis . Nowadays , performance EUS-FNA vary accuracy rate range 60 % - 100 % . Needles different diameter explore retrieve tissue specimen . The diagnostic yield , successful rate safety profile similar . It suggest although thinner needle provide less cellular material large needle , specimens former less contaminated blood , thus easy interpret . In addition , thinner needle may easier use great flexibility , particularly location require important scope bending . As result , new 22G FNA needle design order improve tissue-sampling rate ( ECHO-HD-22-C , Cook Endoscopy , USA ) . There reverse bevel tip new needle promotes collection core sample shear material target lesion retrograde movement needle lesion . The feasibility safety newly design EUS-FNA needle demonstrate recent multicenter , pool , cohort study use 19G version . Successful puncture technically feasible 98.2 % case overall accuracy 92.9 % . There complication relate technique . The aim study compare tissue-sampling rate diagnostic accuracy rate EUS-FNA us convention newly design 22-gauge needle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS-FNA With 22G Procore Needles vs 22G Conventional Needles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) - guide fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) well-established technique tissue sample intestinal extra-intestinal mass lesion . The accuracy EUS-guided FNA vary 60 % - 100 % complication rate 0 % - 3 % . The diagnostic accuracy procedure improve use immunohistochemical study genetic analyses.It may also improve obtain large biopsy specimen core biopsy needle . However , puncture core-biopsy needle may always feasible due technical difficulty insert large needle bend endoscope . As result , advantage core-biopsy needle provide large amount cellular material offset high rate technical failure , especially set transduodenal puncture . Recently , new 22G FNA needle reverse bevel tip become available ( ECHO-HD-22-C , Cook Endoscopy , USA. ) . The design device promote collection core sample shear material target lesion retrograde movement needle lesion . Hence , aim study compare tissue-sampling rate diagnostic accuracy rate EUS-FNA use 22G conventional Procore needle .</detailed_description>
