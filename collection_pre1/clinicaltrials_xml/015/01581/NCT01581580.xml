	<brief_summary>Background : - Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) approve surgery certain movement disorder , like Parkinson 's disease , respond well treatment . DBS use battery-powered device call neurostimulator ( like pacemaker ) place skin chest . It use stimulate area brain affect movement . Stimulating area help block nerve signal cause abnormal movement . Researchers also want record brain function people movement disorder surgery . Objectives : - To study DBS surgery affect Parkinson disease , dystonia , tremor . - To obtain information brain nerve cell function DBS surgery . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age movement disorder , like Parkinson 's disease , essential tremor , dystonia . Design : - Researchers screen patient physical neurological exam decide whether surgery . Patients also medical history , blood test , image study , test . Before surgery , participant practice movement memory test . - During surgery , stimulator place provide right amount stimulation brain . Patients perform movement memory test practice earlier . - After surgery , participant recover hospital . They followup visit within 4 week turn adjust stimulator . The stimulator program adjusted week month find best setting . - Participants return followup visit 1 , 2 , 3 month surgery . Researchers test movement , memory , general quality life . Each visit last 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective protocol provide DBS surgery collect physiology efficacy data relate DBS therapy motor cognitive function people medically refractory Parkinson disease ( PD ) , dystonia , essential tremor ( ET ) . All treatment protocol base current standard care DBS surgery . Study Population : Patients 18 year old medically refractory PD , dystonia and/or ET may participate study . Study Design The treatment render protocol standard care PD , dystonia , ET . Patients confirm medically refractory PD , dystonia ET offer DBS . The therapeutic goal procedure implant chronically stimulate macroelectrodes basal ganglia thalamic nucleus order alleviate symptom PD , dystonia ET . Pre- post-operative imaging use precisely localize electrode location within brain correlated measure clinical efficacy record intra-operative neural activity . Intra-operative microelectrode recording , well micro- macroelectrode electrical stimulation , use confirm position electrode lead . Intra-operative electrode recording also use investigate neurophysiological mechanism deep brain stimulation explore neural circuit underlie motor cognitive processing basal ganglion . Intraoperative physiology use clinical research purpose . Patients follow 3 month surgical procedure determine effectiveness DBS treatment . Outcome Measures : The primary goal protocol determine physiology efficacy DBS surgery movement disorder . Efficacy outcome measure include change motor symptom , measure UPDRS III scale , Burke-Fahn-Marsden ( BFM ) dystonia rating scale1 , Tremor Rating Scale 3 month treatment . Secondary measure include 1 ) level effective drug therapy surgery ; 2 ) change behavior performance activity daily live ; 3 ) complication therapy measure UPDRS I , II , IV scale surgery SF-12 score ; 4 ) radiographic correlation DBS electrode position clinical change ; 5 ) neurophysiological mechanism DBS motor cognitive function basal ganglion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : Be 18 year age old . Able provide inform consent . Have clinical diagnosis idiopathic PD , primary dystonia , ET : The diagnosis idiopathic PD base UK Brain Bank Criteria , confirm Movement Disorders Neurologists NIH Parkinson Clinic The diagnosis primary ( generalized segmental ) , hemidystonia , cervical dystonia confirm clinical examination NIH Movement Disorders Clinic The diagnosis ET confirm clinical examination NIH Movement Disorders Clinic ( diagnosis ET base bilateral , largely symmetric postural kinetic tremor involve hand forearm visible persistent . Additional isolate tremor head may present absence abnormal posturing ) . History appropriate response dopaminergic medication , least 30 % improvement motor UPDRS LDOPA history inclinic testing , PD patient OR : Patients tremordominant PD respond dopaminergic therapy exhibit tremor score least 2 tremor severity least one side body motor UPDRS examination . Unsatisfactory clinical response maximal medical management ( trial high low dos drug ) , include : good benefit dopaminergic medication associate insufficient duration action unacceptable sideeffects OR intractable disable motor fluctuation ( severe period , dyskinesia , freeze spell ) OR intractable symptom ET dystonia impact least 2 activity daily live . Agree undergo DBS indicate treat medically refractory movement disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates exclude meet follow criterion : Clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication , include limited uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; active heart disease need immediate intervention ; active respiratory disease need immediate intervention ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality need therapeutic anticoagulation interrupt ; current preexisting lifethreatening respiratory disease , respiratory failure ARDS . Cognitive impairment Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ( FSIQ ) portion Wechsler Adult Intelligence test , would render participant unable provide inform consent comply study procedure ( FSIQ less 70 ) . Evidence secondary atypical parkinsonism/dystonia/tremor suggest : History CVA , exposure toxin , neuroleptic , encephalitis Neurologic sign upper motor neuron cerebellar involvement , supranuclear gaze palsy , orthostatic hypotension . MRimaging evidence indicative secondary disease iron deposit putamen , tumor , stroke , could cause movement disorder . Features atypical idiopathic Parkinson disease . Dementia evidence formal neuropsychological evaluation Mattis Dementia Rating Scale2 ( DRS2 ) score 128 . Depression anxiety evidence selfreport Beck Depression Inventory2 ( score 20 ) Beck Anxiety Inventory , respectively . Unable undergo MRimaging implant pacemaker , medication pump , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve cochlear implant ) , shrapnel fragment , permanent eye liner small metal fragment eye welder metal worker may , candidate uncomfortable small close space ( claustrophobia ) , lie comfortably back one hour . Pregnant woman . Patients tremordominant PD Scans Without Evidence Dopaminergic Effect ( SWEDD ) exclude base clinical historic information , include DaT functional imaging obtain routine clinical evaluation PD need .</criteria>
