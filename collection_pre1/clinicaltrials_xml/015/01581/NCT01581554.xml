	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic infection hepatitis B virus may lead cirrhosis , liver disease , cancer liver . There cure infection , several drug approve treat . These drug keep virus level low . They seem safe short-term use . But drug yet approve long-term use serious side effect . However , stop treatment soon make infection bad may lead serious form liver disease . Researchers able determine stop treatment . They want study people chronic hepatitis B infection find best time stop treatment prevent disease cause liver damage . Objectives : - To study safety effectiveness withdraw antiviral treatment chronic hepatitis B least 4 year treatment . - To determine whether stop long-term antiviral treatment chronic hepatitis B make infection worse . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age ; take antiviral drug treat chronic hepatitis B least 4 year ; evaluate stop treatment . Design : - Those study screen physical exam , medical history , questionnaire , blood test . They remain care regular doctor study . - They abdominal ultrasound study scar liver , one past year . - Those without detectable level hepatitis B virus blood stop antiviral treatment . They monthly blood test first 6 month check virus level , every 3 month afterward . - Those whose blood test show increase virus level restart antiviral treatment direct study doctor personal doctor . - All study monitor end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Withdrawal Therapy After Long-Term Antiviral Treatment Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B affect least 1.5 million Americans major cause cirrhosis , end-stage liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma . Five oral antiviral agent license use chronic hepatitis B United States . These agent effective suppress viral replication , improve liver disease reverse cirrhosis . The standard indication start antiviral therapy develop widely accept . Less clear long therapy continue condition therapy stop . Withdrawal one year therapy commonly follow relapse rare instance severe fatal . With long course therapy , withdrawal antiviral therapy associate few less severe relapse , criterion stop treatment still unclear . In study , propose withdraw therapy 50 patient HBeAg positive negative chronic hepatitis B receive minimum 4 year oral nucleoside therapy serum HBV DNA level le 500 IU/ml 6 month prior withdrawal . After outpatient evaluation , consent patient withdraw therapy follow carefully presence symptom , abnormal liver test HBV DNA level monthly 6 month every 3 month thereafter . Patients relapse offer retreatment . Patients without relapse follow least four year stop therapy . The primary endpoint study proportion patient maintain HBV DNA &lt; 1,000 IU/ml , serum ALT AST &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal one year therapy . Secondary endpoint proportion patient maintain HBeAg loss clear HBsAg one year therapy , number ALT AST flare , predictor maintain virological suppression HBeAg negativity proportion subject require re-initiation therapy .</detailed_description>
