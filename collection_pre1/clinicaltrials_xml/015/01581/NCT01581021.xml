	<brief_summary>Scoliosis deformity abnormal curvature spine . Surgery main method correct deformity . Rods attach spine make strait . There two way fix rod bone spine : laminar hook pedicle screw . Hooks old form fixation penetrate bone , instead place part vertebra call lamina . Screws new penetrate bone . Screws place part vertebra call pedicle . Most surgeon think screw correct scoliosis well hook . The current literature agree screw well deformity correction lumbar spine patient severe deformity . There disagreement literature regard work well thoracic spine less severe deformity . There randomize , control trial literature examine whether construct use hooks thoracic spine screw lumbar spine ( call hybrid construct ) work well all-screw construct . This clinical study randomize control trial conduct evaluate treatment outcomes patient scoliosis undergoing surgical correction curve use either all-screw hybrid construct fixation device . The study population limit less severe deformity investigator ' hypothesis hybrid construct acceptable screw term correction .</brief_summary>
