	<brief_summary>Introduction- Primary prevention main strategy control global burden cardiovascular disease . In clinical practice , food restriction represent valuable preventive resource . However , low adhesion rate diet abandonment consider important obstacle treatment . Considering discovery new marker mechanisms relate food restriction cardiovascular risk factor , possible necessary seek efficient alternative increase adherence effectiveness preventive dietetic treatment . Surgical procedure use mechanism promote food restriction . The bariatric surgery gain importance potential application obesity treatment also control cardiovascular risk factor refractory medical treatment . Among bariatric operation , group call digestive adaptation III specific characteristics.This surgical intervention modifies intestinal tract reduce gastric volume perform anastomosis ileum stomach , create bipartition gut . This structural modification promotes satiety increase insulin sensitivity intensely surgical strategy . The effect Digestive Adaptation III surgery cardiovascular risk factor marker related development atherosclerosis yet establish . Objectives - To investigate effect Digestive Adaptation III surgery clinical laboratory parameter cardiovascular risk factor . Methods - Twenty diabetic volunteer refractory medical treatment abdominal obesity include study . Of group , half randomly select perform Digestive Adaptations III surgery . All participant undergo clinical biochemical test occasion , thirty day surgery , three twenty-four month surgery . On occasion besides lipid profile glucose , determine incretin hormone , adipokines assess amount epicardial fat .</brief_summary>
