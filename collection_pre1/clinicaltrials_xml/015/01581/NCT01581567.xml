	<brief_summary>Background : - Information sample collect participant medical research study useful even original study complete . Researchers use information sample learn multiple sclerosis immune system disorder . They also use research disorder . Researchers would like get permission use sample collect old study launch new line research . Objectives : - To look information sample earlier National Institutes Health Neuroimmunology Branch study . Eligibility : - People provide sample medical information earlier study . Design : - Researchers contact people take part earlier study . Researchers ask study previously collect data sample . - Data sample may include physical exam data psychological test result . Imaging study result include . Preserved sample body fluid tissue may study . These include blood urine sample . - No new treatment provide part research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose The purpose protocol enable prospective IRB review research use human sample data collect Neuroimmunology Branch ( NIB ) protocols enable retrospective review sample data branch protocol terminate prior full data analysis publication . Subjects Subjects previously participate NIH protocol sample data whose wish regard use samples/data research specify initial protocol know , would like use sample data purpose consent may enrol protocol able contact consent additional use sample data . Study Methods Data Sample Ascension Data sample may include limited demographic personal health information , psychological psychiatric testing , blood , urine , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) body fluid tissue , result medical and/or physiological evaluation , medical imaging . Data sample enter protocol follow terminate IRB-approved protocol human subject enrollment participation complete include : - 01-N-0089 ( Rolipram ) : Safety , tolerability effect Rolipram inflammatory activity central nervous system multiple sclerosis . A phase II , open label crossover trial use MRI outcome measure . - 98-N-0069 ( APL ) : Double-blind , randomize , parallel-group , baseline vs. treatment trial evaluate safety , tolerability effect MRI lesion immunology parameter low vs. high dose CGP 77116 patient MS. - 97-N-0148 ( IFG ) : A 48 week phase II Pilot study tolerability effect/efficacy subcutaneously administer CEP-151 ( rhIGF , Myotrophin ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient . - 94-N-0173 ( Anti-tac HAM/TSP ) : Monoclonal anti-tac antibody immunotherapy HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . - 98-N-0160 ( Avonex HAM/TSP ) : Combined Virological Immunological Evaluation Treatment Patients Early HTLV-1 Associated Myleopathy Recombinant Human Inteferon-beta1 . - 99-N-0169 ( Daclizumab/IFN-beta MS ) : Effect Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Against Interleukin-2 Receptor Alpha Subunit ( IL-2Ra ; Zenapax ) Inflammatory Activity Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Baseline-to-Treatment , Cross-Over , MRI-Controlled Single-Center Phase I/II Trial . - 04-N-0019 ( Daclizumab monotherapy MS ) : ZAP MS Zenapax [ R ] ( daclizumab ) Administered Patients Multiple Sclerosis : Effect intravenously administer humanized monoclonal antibody interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit ( daclizumab ) inflammatory activity central nervous system multiple sclerosis patient baseline-to-treatment , cross-over , MRI-controlled single-centre phase II trial . - 05-N-0039 ( 3T Cortical imaging ) : An Exploratory Study Detection Cortical Damage Patients Multiple Sclerosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging . - 06-N-0154 ( 7T ) : An Exploratory Study Detection Cortical White Matter Damage Patients Multiple Sclerosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging 7 Tesla . - 07-N-0014 ( Cognitive MRI ) : The use Magnetic Resonance Imaging investigate cortical damage Patients Multiple Sclerosis correlation Cognitive Dysfunction . - 02-N-N196 ( Stem Cells ) : Immunological mechanism immune ablation autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation secondary progressive multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>
