	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether administration analogue gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) three month prior perform IVF may improve response ovarian stimulation , implantation rate clinical pregnancy rate patient endometriosis/ endometriomas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Pre-treatment With GnRH Analogues Prior Vitro Fertilization Patients With Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometriosis define presence ectopic endometrial tissue induces local inflammatory reaction . Usually , tissue locate level pelvic region , extrapelvic location describe . It chronic disease whose cause unknown , although genetic predisposition proven . It estimate endometriosis affect 7-15 % woman fertile age , 30-40 % woman endometriosis infertility . Assisted reproduction technique ( ART ) treatment many cause infertility , include endometriosis . The result assist reproduction woman endometriosis appear somewhat bad obtained woman without endometriosis . Some author prove significant reduction implantation pregnancy rate patient . The bad pregnancy rate implantation believe originated poor oocyte quality , lead low rate fertilization . This poor oocyte quality produce poor quality embryo reduce capacity implant , particularly severe endometriosis . On hand , endometrial receptivity appear contribute reduction result ART woman . In attempt improve ART outcomes woman endometriosis , different strategy propose prior cycle realization , different result . Surgical resection endometriomas ( endometriosis cyst ) cycle IVF/ICSI may adversely affect result . On hand , careful laparoscopic cystectomy appear affect ovarian response stimulation . In addition surgical approach , try different medical treatment improve result IVF / intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( ICSI ) woman endometriosis . It suggest treatment Danazol prior IVF may improve result . Similarly , prolong treatment GnRH analogues month IVF could improve implantation pregnancy rate . Unfortunately , many study randomize / control true value therapy GnRH analogues IVF woman endometriosis still need value . A recent meta-analysis show 3-6 month treatment GnRH analogues IVF increase 4 time odds clinical pregnancy woman endometriosis . Nevertheless , result conclude 165 patient 78 pregnancy , include 3 clinical trial , specifically patient endometriomas . The lack study proper design , suggest insufficient evidence present establish firm recommendation regard . This study contribute increase scientific evidence recommend pretreatment GnRH agonists IVF en patient endometriosis .</detailed_description>
