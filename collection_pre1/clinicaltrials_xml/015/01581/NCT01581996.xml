	<brief_summary>Positive phosphorus balance hyperphosphatemia ( increase serum phosphorus level ) common complication people advance chronic kidney disease ( i.e. , stage 5 CKD ) , include chronic dialysis patient , associate severe morbidity increase mortality . Despite attempt control serum phosphorus dietary phosphorus restriction use medicine bind phosphorus gastrointestinal tract phosphorus absorb body ( also call phosphate binder ) , chronic dialysis patient frequently remain hyperphosphatemic , particularly time commence regular dialysis treatment . Fosrenol ( lanthanum carbonate , manufacture Shire Pharmaceuticals ) gastrointestinal phosphate binder appear advantage safe , well tolerated effective binding phosphate . There limited data magnitude bind phosphorus Fosrenol human gastrointestinal tract patient chronic kidney disease . The specific aim proposal follow : 1 . To quantify , precisely control metabolic balance condition , increase fecal excretion dietary phosphorus occur patient undergo chronic peritoneal dialysis ( CPD ) ingest Fosrenol ( lanthanum carbonate ) . 2 . To examine dose response relationship Fosrenol treatment fecal phosphorus excretion . The investigator examine CPD patient ingest constant phosphorus intake , much additional phosphorus excrete feces three different dose level Fosrenol , 1.5 , 3.0 , 4.5 g/day . 3 . To examine increased fecal phosphorus loss negative phosphorus balance cause Fosrenol intake affect serum phosphorus hormonal regulator phosphorus metabolism serum parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , fibroblast growth factor-23 , 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ( 25 ( OH ) D3 ) , 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) fetuin-A . 4 . To assess whether effect Fosrenol increase intestinal phosphate bind protein-nitrogen balance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seven clinically stable patient undergo CPD least six month admit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 46 day . During time feed , strict metabolic balance study condition , constant energy protein intake design meet previously ascertain nutritional need . Their dietary intake phosphorus , calcium magnesium maintain constant throughout 46 day study 1100 mg/day , 1000 mg/day 200 mg/day , respectively . Patients treat throughout study constant peritoneal dialysis regimen consist either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis four dialysate exchange daily automate peritoneal dialysis receive four dialysate exchange per night ; possibly day-time dialysate exchange . The number volume dialysate exchange dialysate glucose concentration may vary among patient accord metabolic clinical need , constant patient . Patients adhere standard metabolic balance protocol investigator conduct many previous metabolic balance study . These protocol include participate prescribed daily exercise regimen design maintain patient ' physical activity prestudy , outpatient level . All patient first undergo 10 day Baseline period metabolic equilibration time receive phosphate binder . They receive three period Fosrenol treatment three different dose level 12 day . During three period , patient receive , random order , one two Fosrenol tablet provide 500 , 1000 , 1500 mg three meal feed day . Thus CPD patient receive random order 1500 , 3000 4500 mg/day Fosrenol prescribe one 12 day period . Outcome Measurements . All urine , collect 24 hour urine specimen , feces excrete , collect four day period , obtain continuously . Every 4 day duplicate 24 hour diet prepared chemical analysis . The specimen analyze phosphorus , calcium nitrogen spectrographic , atomic absorption spectroscopic Kjeldahl analyse , respectively . Serum phosphorus , calcium , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , fibroblast growth factor-23 , 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ( 25 ( OH ) D3 ) , 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) , fetuin-A , urea creatinine measure fasting state begin 40 day balance period every 5 day . Anthropometry standard measurement routinely conduct metabolic balance procedure also perform .</detailed_description>
