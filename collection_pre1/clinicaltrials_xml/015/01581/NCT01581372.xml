The objective study evaluate effect enhance pharmacist care ( i.e. , participant identification , assessment , care plan development , education/counseling , prescribing/titration lipid-lowering medication close follow-up ) proportion participant achieve target LDL-cholesterol level . Hypothesis : Enhanced pharmacist care result significant decrease LDL-c level , observe usual care patient . Design : This randomize controlled trial enhance pharmacist care . The study conduct twelve community pharmacy Alberta , include several Safeway Pharmacies . The participant population compose adult uncontrolled dyslipidemia define 2009 Canadian Dyslipidemia Guidelines . The primary intervention pharmacist direct dyslipidemia care . Participants randomize usual care receive usual care pharmacist physician . Study Implications : To investigator knowledge , study first randomize trial pharmacist prescribe dyslipidemia . This study important implication improve patient ' access care , especially provinces proceed grant additional prescribing authority pharmacist . The ability conduct study province pharmacist already ability prescribe unique .
