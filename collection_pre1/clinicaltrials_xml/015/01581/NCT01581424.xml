	<brief_summary>The investigator perform study two major component . The first natural history study untreated Fabry patient . This study component detail kidney microscopic structural change Fabry patient start enzyme replacement therapy correlate change kidney function , include glomerular filtration rate urinary albumin excretion rate . The investigator perform study sample obtain baseline , enzyme replacement therapy initiate . The goal study find kidney microscopic change biopsy associate kidney disfunction . Our hypothesis study : 1 . Much natural history Fabry renal structural change occur without detectable renal functional alteration . 2 . Structural change associate initial onset proteinuria associate subsequent progressive loss filtration function differ best describe non-linear model . 3 . There sufficient precision Fabry renal structural-functional relationship support renal structure acceptable clinical trial surrogate endpoint later renal functional deterioration . The second component examines effect age gender start enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) , well dosage level ERT renal cellular clearance GL3 Fabry patient compare baseline follow-up kidney biopsy perform 5 , 11 , 60 month later , comparison match ERT treatment duration . Our hypothesis component study follow : 1 . Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( ERT ) institute young age effective reduce podocytes ( PC ) , distal tubular cell ( DTC ) , arterial smooth muscle cell ( ASMC ) GL-3 old Fabry patient . 2 . Earlier institution ERT stabilize PC number later ERT institution , especially proteinuric adult , may prevent progressive decline PC number associate glomerular sclerosis , tubulointerstitial injury , GFR loss . 3 . Whereas low ERT dose may effectively clear GL-3 endothelial mesangial cell , less effective clear GL-3 PC also DTC ASMC . 4 . Affected cell clear GL-3 equivalently females male .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fabry disease rare genetic disease deficient activity enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Deficient activity enzyme lead accumulation lipid-derived inclusion different organ include kidney , heart vessel . These inclusion find kidney even birth . The early known clinical manifestation Fabry kidney disease appearance excess protein urine , usually occur second decade life . However , study , well investigator show evidence kidney injury start much earlier . Once excess protein find urine , kidney function deterioration become progressive , Fabry patient require kidney transplantation hemodialysis third fifth decade life . The lesion composite lesion responsible functional deterioration kidney Fabry disease well know . Their delineation use quantitative , unbiased , morphometric method help understand disease , develop surrogate structural outcome early intervention trial . Enzyme replacement therapy may stabilize kidney function . However , long-term effect kidney survival know . Moreover , early know predictor kidney dysfunction adjust evaluate effectiveness enzyme replacement therapy . Our study renal GL-3 clearance compare pre-and post-ERT renal biopsy use method allow u determine whether age institution treatment ERT dose affect ERT induce GL-3 cellular clearance , especially cell ERT less effective , i.e. , podocytes , vascular smooth muscle cell distal tubular cell . Finally , hypothesis mosaicism Fabry disease female cell podocytes either affect normal ERT clearance affect podocytes female , male , dependant age institution treatment ERT dose .</detailed_description>
