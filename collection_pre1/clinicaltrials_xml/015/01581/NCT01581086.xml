	<detailed_description>The goal project identify characterize population risk develop pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The project establish PAH subphenotype core cohort ( CORE ) evaluate mechanistic pathway test novel therapeutic agent . This core cohort serve resource Translational Program Project grant , Vascular Subphenotypes Lung Disease ( Mark Gladwin , PI ) . In order construct CORE , choose recruit COPD HIV patient , two population advance lung systemic disease enrich PAH . We select prototypic condition : A ) COPD patient HIV-infected patient develop PAH rate significantly great general population , B ) morbidity mortality greatly increase dually-affected person , C ) mechanisms responsible development PAH `` subphenotype '' well-understood , D ) clinical genetic characteristic subgroup PAH known , E ) effect PAH therapy subphenotypes incompletely study . There also overlap COPD HIV , HIV-infected patient accelerate COPD even effective antiretroviral therapy . Participants COPD , HIV , HIV-uninfected control recruit study base entry criterion elevate N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) and/or abnormal echocardiogram . These subject undergo 6-minute walk test , blood collection , questionnaire , medical record review , echocardiography ( previously perform ) . Selected subject recruit undergo right heart catheterization . The goal study establish pulmonary hypertension cohort translational investigation , determine utility NT-proBNP biomarker PAH , determine clinical characteristic relationship lung function PAH COPD HIV , establish biorepository mechanistic study PAH phenotype .</detailed_description>
