	<brief_title>Evaluating Pharmacokinetics High-Dose Rifapentine When Given Single Dose Divided Doses Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB continue major global health problem , estimate 9.4 million new case 1.3 million death TB 2009 . Effective treatment available , current standard therapy consist 4 different drug must give 6 month effective . RPT rifamycin antibiotic approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) give twice weekly intensive phase TB treatment weekly continuation phase TB treatment . However , study use regimen see high relapse rate TB ; use high and/or frequent dos may necessary attain high cure rate . This study evaluate 2 strategy optimize RPT exposure : dividing daily dose order increase absorption/overall drug exposure provide dose together food . Participants randomly assign one 4 arm : Arm 1A , Arm 1B , Arm 2A , Arm 2B . The first 12 participant indicate willing remain study 12 week assign Arm 2A ; others randomize Arm 1A , 1B , 2B . Participants arm receive daily RPT Day 1 14 , follow washout period Day 15 42 RPT give , follow second period daily RPT Day 43 56 ( continue Day 70 participant Arm 2A ) . Arms 1A 2B evaluate twice-daily versus once-daily RPT take low-fat meal ; Arms 2A 2B evaluate once-daily RPT give egg versus low-fat breakfast . Total study duration range 63 70 day Arms 1A , 1B , 2B , 10 study visit : 4 intensive pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample visit ( Days 0 2 , 13 15 , 42 44 , 55 57 ) 6 visit screen Days 7 , 21 , 35 , 49 , final visit Days 63 70 . Total study duration Arm 2A range 77 84 day , 12 study visit : 5 intensive PK sample visit ( Days 0 2 , 13 15 , 42 44 , 55 57 , 69 71 ) 7 visit screen Days 7 , 21 , 35 , 49 , 64 , final visit Days 77 84 . Intensive PK visit require participant admit clinic 1 2 night blood collect multiple time . Interim study visit may consist give medical history , undergo physical exam blood collection , undergoing pregnancy test woman reproductive potential . Participants also require keep diary time take outpatient study drug , medication take study drug , symptom experience .</detailed_description>
