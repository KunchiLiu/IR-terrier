It generally accept inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption consequently low serum low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration 10 % daily intakes 2.5 g. The exact underlying mechanism plant sterol/stanol mediate reduction intestinal cholesterol absorption still unknown . It suggest low activity sterol uptake transporter like Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein ( NPC1L1 ) enterocytes , otherwise several study indicate compound could activate liver X receptor ( LXR ) enterocytes , thereby activate ABC transporter involve intestinal cholesterol metabolism , whereas recently suggestion make plant sterol stanols activate transintestinal cholesterol excretion ( TICE ) . This direct cholesterol secretion blood intestinal lumen , enterocytes play central role . None assumption far evaluate human . Objective : The major objective present study examine acute effect dietary plant stanol ester intestinal mucosal gene expression profile intestinal biopsy healthy volunteer . The minor objective investigate whether semi-long-term use ( 3 week ) plant stanol ester effect microbiota composition .</brief_summary>
