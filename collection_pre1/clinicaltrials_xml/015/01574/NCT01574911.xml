	<brief_summary>Volumetry essential diagnosis follow-up patient limb edema . The objective project validation real-time reconstruction calculation limb volume use 3D laser scanner . Water - displacement volumetry ( water-filled boot ) reference method know accuracy reproducibility , commonly use clinical practice cumbersome , difficult , time-consuming . The commonly use method remain segmental limb perimetry tape measure , follow volume calculation use truncate cone formula , thus exclude de fact extremity ( hand foot ) neither liken cone easily measure . Quantification limb volume volume change essential diagnosis follow-up patient chronic venous insufficiency lymphedema , two common pathological condition . It mandatory evaluation therapeutic approach . The present study use innovative technology volume acquisition freehand laser scan hand-held camera Quantification limb volume volume change essential diagnosis follow-up patient chronic venous insufficiency lymphedema , two common pathological condition . It mandatory evaluation therapeutic approach . The present study use innovative technology volume acquisition freehand laser scan hand-held camera real-time 3D reconstruction . Its advantage non-contact , accurate detail quantification edema , include extremity , allow assess magnitude topography physiological , pathological , treatment - induced volume change . This approach ultimately provide data use design personalized limb compression ortheses .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation New Method Limb Volumetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In subject patient , limb volume measure water - displacement ( WD ) twice 3D laser scanning ( 3D ) , 2 independent operator , random order . In subgroup patient , measurement repeat morning evening , twice year ( winter summer ) estimate nycthemeral seasonal effect . Measurements perform healthy subject patient chronic venous insufficiency lymphedema .</detailed_description>
