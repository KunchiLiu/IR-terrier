	<brief_summary>Social phobia third common psychiatric disorder besides depression alcoholism . Several study demonstrate efficacy cognitive-behavioral therapy treatment social phobia . Nevertheless , effect third people exist treatment method . Pharmacological therapy similar effect , high rate relapse discontinuation medication . Social phobia characterize fear performance interaction situation . The strong fear negative evaluation others usually accompany marked avoidance behavior increase physical symptom blushing , sweat , palpitation , tremor . The confrontation phobic stimulus lead retrieval stimulus-associated aversive memory , result immediate anxiety response . Several study already show elevated glucocorticoid impair retrieval declarative memory content healthy subject . The investigator demonstrate anxiety-reducing effect administration cortisone confrontation phobic stimulus patient social spider phobia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Anxiety disorder major public health significance social phobia rank third common mental health disorder depression alcoholism . Even though cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) effective non-pharmacological approach treatment social phobia , one third patient respond treatment , achieve partial remission symptom . Pharmacotherapy ( e.g. , SSRIs , benzodiazepine ) show effective acute treatment social phobia , however , high rate relapse medication discontinue . In addition , combination CBT medication seem beneficial CBT alone . Consequently , development innovative psychobiological approach combine effective psychotherapy method synergizing substance administration primary challenge interdisciplinary research treatment social phobia . In recent study investigator find evidence pharmacological elevation glucocorticoid level reduces fear patient social phobia spider phobia expose phobic stimulus . Furthermore , investigator show repeated administration glucocorticoid exposure phobic stimulus lead extinction phobic fear . Also low-dose administration cortisone month patient post-traumatic stress disorder reduces cardinal symptom disorder . Based finding , glucocorticoid treatment , combination exposure therapy , may help reduce fear promote extinction phobic fear . In interdisciplinary research project involve psychology , behavioral pharmacology psychiatry , genetics neuroimaging investigator propose investigate therapeutic efficacy combine exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy ( CBGT ) hydrocortisone treatment . The investigator hypothesize hydrocortisone exerts acute beneficial effect reduce fear exposure , long-term beneficial effect facilitate extinction phobic fear . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize differential treatment response depend genetic variation glucocorticoid-related gene ( substudy 1 ) . These hypothesis test clinical study 100 patient mainly speech anxiety fulfill DSM-IV criterion diagnosis social phobia 60 patient spider phobia . This first study aim determine therapeutic efficacy combine hydrocortisone administration short-term exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy treatment social phobic patient specific speech anxiety patient spider phobia . Considering large number patient suffer social phobia , suggest interdisciplinary project important clinical implication development effective therapy . Objective To determine whether short-term treatment 20 mg hydrocortisone enhance efficacy exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy ( CBGT ) patient social phobia , specifically speech anxiety patient spider phobia . A series study indicate elevate glucocorticoid level inhibit retrieval memory healthy human . Further low-dose administration glucocorticoid month inhibit retrieval traumatic memory patient post traumatic stress disorder . These finding suggest glucocorticoid might also inhibit retrieval fear memory phobia social phobia expose phobic stimulus . Additionally , investigator find evidence indicating repeat administration glucocorticoid exposure phobic stimulus lead extinction phobic fear . Based finding , glucocorticoid treatment , combination exposure therapy , may help reduce fear promote extinction phobic fear . Methods In placebo-controlled double-blind study design , patient randomly assign receive CBGT + hydrocortisone ( Social Phobia : N=50 / Spider Phobia : N=30 ) CBGT + placebo ( Social Phobia : N=50 / Spider Phobia : N=30 ) . Psychopathological symptom stress reactivity assess psychometric endocrine parameter , CBGT therapy . The patient possibility attend neuroimaging study , investigator examine localize anxiolytic effect acute glucocorticoid administration brain ( substudy 2 ) . In substudy 2 investigator compare patient social phobia patient specific spider phobia healthy control previous study ( Soravia et al . 2006 ) .</detailed_description>
