	<brief_summary>This study conduct learn effect SC-PEG , new form chemotherapy drug call asparaginase . Asparaginase use treat ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma . The standard form asparaginase , call Elspar , give muscle week 30 week . There forms asparaginase . The investigator study two : Oncaspar Calaspargase Pegol ( SC-PEG ) . The investigator previously study give Oncaspar vein ( instead muscle ) every 2 week patient ALL , show dose lead side effect Elspar give weekly muscle . The study drug , SC-PEG , similar identical Oncaspar . SC-PEG give vein child adolescent ALL part research study , appear last long blood dose Oncaspar . It yet approve FDA . The goal research study learn whether side effect drug level SC-PEG give vein every 3 week similar Oncaspar give vein every 2 week . The study also help determine whether change treatment child adolescents ALL high level minimal residual disease may improve cure rate . Measuring minimal disease ( MRD ) laboratory test find low level leukemia cell investigator see microscope . In past , show child adolescent ALL high level MRD one month treatment less likely cure low level MRD . Therefore , study , bone marrow blood end first month treatment measure participant leukemia , change therapy implement base measurement . It known sure change treatment improve cure rate . MRD level measure marrow fill cancer cell time diagnosis . Therefore , MRD study do child adolescent ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma . Another part study determine whether give antibiotic first month treatment even participant without fever prevent serious infection blood part body . About 25 % child adolescents ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma receive standard treatment develop serious blood infection bacteria first month treatment . Typically , antibiotic ( medicine fight bacteria ) give vein child leukemia lymphoma develop fever sign infection . In study , antibiotic give mouth vein participant first month treatment , whether develop fever . Another goal study learn vitamin D level relate bone problem ( broken bone fracture ) child adolescents ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma experience treatment . Some chemotherapy drug use treat ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma make bone weak , make fracture likely . Vitamin D natural substance food sunlight help keep bone strong . The investigator study often participant low level vitamin D receive chemotherapy , , low level , whether give vitamin D supplement increase level . Another focus study learn biology ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma research blood , bone spinal fluid bone marrow sample . The goal research improve treatment child leukemia future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SC-PEG Asparaginase vs. Oncaspar Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether child adolescent ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma eligible participate study , screen test perform , may include follow : medical history , bone marrow test , assessment tumor , blood test and/or EKG . Participants enroll study receive anti-leukemia drug call chemotherapy . During study treatment , study doctor continue perform test blood , bone marrow spinal fluid ass disease respond study treatment look possible side effect . Scans ( example , x-ray , CT scan MRI scan ) may also do begin study treatment look possible side effect . If disease initially diagnose scan , also repeat study treatment ass respond . There three different treatment group leukemia lymphoblastic lymphoma divide differ slightly type amount chemotherapy drug use 2-years therapy . Participants assign different category base feature leukemia lymphoma , age , white blood cell count , result test . The three different treatment group call `` Standard Risk '' , `` High Risk '' `` Very High Risk '' . Participants give several different chemotherapy drug many period treatment ( call `` phase '' ) . These drug know kill lymphoblastic cancer cell . Some drug give mouth , vein ( intravenously ) , others injection ( shot ) muscle . Some chemotherapy drug give directly spinal fluid ( call intrathecal chemotherapy ) lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . This treatment help prevent cancer cell come back spinal fluid brain . The first phase treatment steroid prophase . This phase treatment typically give hospital . This phase treatment begin immediately . enrol study . The second phase treatment remission induction . This phase begin immediately steroid prophase last four week . Participants typically remain hospital ( sometimes ) phase . At end remission induction phase , participant undergo test determine remission . This test involve get sample blood , bone marrow spinal fluid look cancer cell microscope . This test also involve get repeat scan normal time diagnosis . Remission mean cancer cell detect microscope blood , marrow spinal fluid , cancer previously see scan significantly improve longer see . Participants must remission go onto next phase treatment ; alternative treatment discuss participant remission end induction phase . The Consolidation I phase begin determine participant remission . This phase last three week . This phase treatment give hospital , participant may able leave hospital first week phase . The purpose phase reduce number cancer cell body . The next phase Central Nervous System ( CNS ) phase , usually give outpatient set . Participants may need admitted hospital phase treatment complication develop , infection . This phase therapy begin immediately Consolidation I phase last 3 week . Treatment involve series lumbar puncture anti-leukemia drug give intrathecally two week period . Anti-leukemia drug also give mouth vein phase well . Some participant may receive radiation therapy phase , although . The decision treat radiation base characteristic cancer diagnosis whether cancer cell see spinal fluid time . Radiation therapy painless procedure , purpose prevent leukemia come back brain . For participant receive radiation therapy , give either 8 10 daily treatment , depend many leukemia cell see spinal fluid microscope diagnosis . The next phase study Consolidation II . This phase begin 3 week start CNS phase last 27 week . During phase , chemotherapy give three-week cycle , drug give clinic drug give mouth home . Participants typically treat outpatient phase . The last phase call Continuation . This also usually give outpatient . The goal phase rid body remain cancer cell . The cycle chemotherapy phase repeat every 3 week , drug give clinic drug give mouth home . This phase end two year remission document . The randomization study involve two form asparaginase , Oncaspar SC-PEG asparaginase . Because one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one study group : receive Oncaspar receive SC-PEG . Randomization mean participant put group chance . Participants place Oncaspar group receive single dose Oncaspar Day 7 Remission Induction phase , every 2 week 30 week start CNS phase ( 16 total dos Oncaspar ) . Participants place SC-PEG group receive SC-PEG asparaginase Day 7 remission induction phase every 3 week begin CNS phase ( 11 total dos SC-PEG ) . Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) test way look low level leukemia body see microscope . These test do laboratory Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . If MRD result low range Day 32 , thre change treatment program describe . If MRD result high range , recommend treatment change . Participants receive fluoroquinolone antibiotic beginning first phase treatment continue neutrophil monocyte ( two type white blood cell blood help fight infection ) increase . The goal give antibiotic prevent infection first week treatment . Participants agree extra blood drawn test vitamin D level blood 1 teaspoon blood drawn follow time : start treatment , end first month treatment , start continuation phase , end treatment . Participants receive result test . If vitamin D level low , study doctor recommend participant take vitamin D supplement . Participants may choose blood drawn check vitamin D level , may choose take vitamin D supplement . Participants ask time study entry agree provide additional blood bone marrow sample research . These additional sample use learn biology ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma . Stored specimen may also use future research regard leukemia . After complete treatment , participant ask come physical exam blood work every month first six month final treatment , every two month next 6 month , every four month next year , every six month next year . After ask come year . The investigator would like keep track medical condition participant rest life . This do review medical record participant . The investigator may telephone participant finish treatment see see doctor least year .</detailed_description>
