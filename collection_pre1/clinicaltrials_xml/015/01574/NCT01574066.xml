	<brief_title>Chest CT-scan Diagnosis Community-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational : Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) frequent infectious disorder patient visit ED . CAP responsible high morbidity associated-mortality increase Western country . CAP correspond invasion lung pathogen . Diagnosis depend clinical X-ray assessment . However , sign symptoms poorly specific often lack . As prognosis depend precocious fitted antimicrobial treatment , make CAP diagnosis short time span ( 4-8 hour ) mandatory . Preliminary study suggest chest CT-scan could over-performed X-ray diagnosis CAP . Consensus conferences suggest use CT-scan patient uncertain diagnosis unusual presentation outcome . Because CT-scan currently easily available , use first intent questionable ED patient suspect CAP . Primary objective : estimate impact CT-scan diagnostic ED patient suspect CAP . Secondary objective : estimate impact CT-scan treatment ( antimicrobial therapy ) site care ED patient suspect CAP . Prospective multicenter study measure chest CT-scan impact . 350 patient visit ED 4 inner tertiary teaching hospital Paris , France , suspect CAP . Management : Patients manage accord current guideline , include conventional chest X-ray . Evaluation criterion . Attending ED physician implement pre- post-test proforma diagnosis ( CAP ) level certainty , treatment ( antimicrobial agent ) , site care , chest CT-scan . Comparison ED physician 's answer before/after CT-scan . Patients follow day 28 . An adjudication committee ( 1 pneumologist , 1 infectiologist , 1 radiologist ) review patient ' data gold standard diagnosis . Statistical consideration : The investigator hypothesize chest CT-scan wil modify diagnosis certainty 20 % . This imply 300 participant enrol allow assessment change 15 % et 25 % . Undue change calculate posteriori diagnosis gold standard establish adjudication committee . Anticipated result : Chest CT-scan improve diagnosis certainty , treatment site-of-care patient visit ED suspect CAP . If observe least 20 % , investigator measure impact chest CT-scan prospective randomize interventional study .</detailed_description>
