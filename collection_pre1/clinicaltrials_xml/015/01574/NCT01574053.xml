	<brief_summary>Enroll-HD longitudinal , observational , multinational study integrate two exist Huntington 's Disease ( HD ) registry , REGISTRY Europe COHORT North America Australia , also expand include site Latin America Asia . With end date annual assessment , goal Enroll-HD build large rich database longitudinal clinical information biospecimens . This database serve basis future study aim develop tool biomarkers progression prognosis , identify clinically relevant phenotypic characteristic , establish clearly define endpoint interventional study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enroll -HD : A Prospective Registry Study Global Huntington 's Disease Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective Enroll-HD develop comprehensive repository prospective systematically collect clinical research data ( demography , clinical feature , family history , genetic characteristic ) biological specimen ( blood ) individual manifest HD , unaffected individual know carry HD mutation risk carry HD mutation , control research participant ( e.g. , spouse , sibling offspring HD mutation carrier know carry HD mutation ) . Enroll-HD conceived broad-based long-term project maximize efficiency non-clinical research participation clinical research . With 200 site roughly 30 country , Enroll HD large database available HD researcher .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Carriers : This group comprise primary study population consist individual carry HD gene expansion mutation . Controls : This group comprise comparator study population consist individual carry HD expansion mutation . These two major category subdivide six different subgroup eligible individual : Manifest/Motormanifest HD : Carriers clinical feature regard opinion investigator diagnostic HD . PreManifest/Motormanifest HD : Carriers without clinical feature regard diagnostic HD . Genotype Unknown : This group include first second degree relative , i.e. , relate blood carrier , undergone predictive test HD therefore undetermined carrier status . Genotype Negative : This group include first second degree relative , i.e. , relate blood carrier , undergone predictive test HD know carry HD expansion mutation . Family Control : Family member individual related blood carrier ( e.g. , spouse , partner , caregiver ) . Community Controls : Individuals unrelated HD carrier grow family affect HD . Data collect community control use generation normative data substudies . Participant status capture study database use 2 variable : 1 ) Investigator Determined Status : base clinical sign symptom genotyping performed part medical care , update every visit 2 ) Research Genotyping Status : base genotyping conduct part EnrollHD study procedure . Based research genotyping , participant reclassify variable Genotype Unknown 'Carriers ' 'Controls ' . Investigators participant blind reclassification . Individuals meet inclusion criterion , Individuals choreic movement disorder context negative test HD gene mutation . For Community Controls : individual major central nervous system disorder exclude ( e.g . stroke , Parkinson disease , Multiple Sclerosis , etc. ) . Participants 18 may eligible participate ( juvenileonset HD ) .</criteria>
