	<detailed_description>Because historically poor outcome lung cancer patient , suboptimal therapeutic efficacy , significant side effect chemotherapy , need choose efficacious treatment regimen , patient likely benefit , need predict priori whether individual patient 's tumor respond particular therapeutic agent . However , virtually lung cancer tumor sample available today resection specimen direct , intra-patient molecular-clinical therapy correlation impossible . Without critical mass tissue data necessary identify optimal molecular target lung cancer drug active target , new discovery offer hope long-term survival many lung cancer patient remain elusive . This study facilitate collection biospecimens advance lung cancer patient routine determination panel document clinically significant biomarkers . In addition , centrally integrate standardize research tissue sample correspond proteomic , genomic , molecular clinical data across multitude institution oncology network</detailed_description>

Measurable evaluable disease . ECOG performance status 02 expect survival least 3 month . Tumor specimen : Tumor specimen : 4.7.1 First Priority : availability minimum 1 X 10 mm core fresh frozen tumor , ≥3 mm diameter spherical pellet pleural effusion ( ≥50 % tumor cell ) , ≥3 mm diameter spherical pellet fine needle aspirate ( ≥50 % tumor cell ) clinically indicate interventional procedure , systemic anticancer therapy radiation sit evaluable disease collection biopsy entry study ( e.g . brain metastasis radiate lung tumor , latter could still biopsied subject enrol radiation therapy brain metastasis ( vice versa ) ) . Second Priority : availability paraffinembedded tumor ( via biopsy pleural effusion ) least 5 X 5 mm ( 3 X 3 mm pleural effusion ) crosssectional tumor area , systemic anticancer therapy radiation sit evaluable disease collection biopsy entry study ; collection paraffinembedded tissue may take place 12 month prior enrollment CASTLE .
