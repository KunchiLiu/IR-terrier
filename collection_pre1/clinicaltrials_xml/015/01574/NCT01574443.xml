	<detailed_description>1 . Once electrode array place first surgery ( day admission ) record brain activity subject wake anesthesia 2 . While subject stay New York Presbyterian hospital second surgery record brain activity . Most recording perform subject go sleep naturally , recording acquire waking hour . This interfere normal monitoring seizure activity . 3 . Final recording session immediately second operation general anesthesia gradually induced . During time subject may ask follow simple command like : `` Open eye '' order determine level consciousness . Also session , arterial line place anesthesiologist real-time blood pressure monitor collect several small ( ~1 ml ) blood sample determine blood concentration anesthetic . Approximately 1 teaspoon blood obtain total . No additional venipuncture necessary . No additional invasive procedure perform purpose study . We use electrode array typically use monitor map epilepsy . Subjects receive anesthetic agent commonly use induction anesthesia surgery ( propofol ) . Subjects monitor way normally do surgical procedure stay New York Presbyterian hospital . As part study subject may ask simple question go anesthesia . We may collect several small blood sample ( describe ) determine concentration anesthetic agent .</detailed_description>
