	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second leading cause cancer death United States affect men woman almost equally . The United States Preventative Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) currently recommend screen three option , include fecal testing , flexible sigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy . Screening CRC fecal occult blood testing ( use guaiac-based test ) do annually biennially show decrease mortality 15-33 % primarily detection early stage cancer . Guaiac fecal occult blood testing ( gFOBT ) know positive balance benefit risk screen population , least expensive , preferred method screen 30-55 % patient . The fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) offer significant improvement gFOBT , notably easy use ( require few sample dietary medication restriction ) sensitive gFOBT respect detect CRC precancerous adenoma . As result improved test performance usability , 2008 multiple professional society endorse use four type FITs colorectal cancer screen . Kaiser Permanente currently use OC-Micro FIT fecal screen test region . In recent year , intensive effort undertaken identify blood-based marker may provide promise alternative supplement fecal test non-invasive CRC screening . One method development identify aberrantly methylated gene cancer tissue blood test . Prior study explore specific colorectal cancer gene show high difference methylation cancer background genetic expression . Of , methylation Septin 9 gene qPCR assay relatively well study . The propose study aim evaluate whether Septin 9 biomarker may use supplement OC-Micro FIT colorectal cancer screen way safely reduce unneeded colonoscopy . The population interest study—those positive screen OC-Micro fecal immunochemical test—has CRC prevalence approximately 5 % . Knowing well Septin 9 identify without cancer prior colonoscopy important largely colonoscopy , even do diagnostically ( e.g. , positive FIT result ) , cause serious complication .</brief_summary>
