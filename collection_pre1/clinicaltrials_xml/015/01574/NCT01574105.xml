	<brief_summary>Blood anticoagulated use drug name heparin open-heart surgery allow safely pass heart-lung machine pump blood throughout body surgery . Each patient give heparin need surgery . This mean patient receive less heparin patient . In study , investigator evaluate current anticoagulation protocol open heart surgery use Royal University Hospital . The goal project compare patient require receive heparin proper anticoagulation patient require receive less heparin . Open-heart surgery proceed accord standard hospital protocol . All research participant treat accord standard post-open heart surgery protocol ICU . This include measurement blood loss keep track chest tube output administration blood transfusion . This study focus Saskatoon Health Region patient open heart surgery term protocol anticoagulation blood transfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heparin Dose Post Operative Bleeding Cardiopulmonary Bypass Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examine heparin dos patient cardiopulmonary bypass support surgery term sensitivity resistance heparin standard anticoagulant use . The investigator use Heparin Management System , analyser perform heparin dose response test . In test , patient 's whole blood mixed increase amount heparin determine require dose achieve set level anticoagulation . Patients find resistant heparin need high dose think bleed post operatively . It view patient give correct amount heparin reverse correct amount protamine ( reversal agent ) bleeding determine heparin dose . Hypothesis statement : Higher dos heparin cause increase postoperative bleeding transfusion event postoperative CPB patient . Purposes Study 1 . Compare heparin sensitive resistant patient term postoperative bleed transfusion event . 2 . Determine incidence heparin sensitivity resistance patient . 3 . Identify preoperative factor lead heparin resistance sensitivity patient . 4 . Using Heparin Dose Response test determine heparin resistant sensitive patient . 5 . Examination anticoagulation protocol open-heart surgery . 6 . Effect preoperative antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy perioperative care . 7 . Use routine laboratory test value well common clinically available value conduct study result would clinically relevant . This prospective observational study . Patients divide two group dependant upon result heparin dose response test ; sensitive resistant . Two group thirty select achieve 90 % power 0.025 level significance use one-sided two-sample t-test . The primary investigator collect data submit mean statistician . Based anecdotal experience investigator expect difference two group term chest tube loss transfusion event post-operatively . This work quite relevant investigator daily practice . Every open heart patient anticoagulated heparin bleeds post operatively . The investigator goal reproducibly safe anticoagulation level acceptable level chest tube loss . This translate get patient operate room timely fashion minimize transfusion event .</detailed_description>
