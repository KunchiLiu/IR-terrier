	<detailed_description>Tumours brain central nervous system ( CNS ) common solid tumour child . Amongst , glioma frequent , although term cover different histological subtypes , frequent astrocytoma . However , rare disease low prevalence . The mortality rate pediatric CNS cancer decrease proportion tumour child . High grade glioma unfavorable prognosis therapeutic option . The objective response rate ( ORR ) tumours chemotherapy range 11 % 27 % , best case . Relapsed high-grade glioma intrinsic brain stem tumours uniformly fatal outcome despite treatment test . The treatment adult de novo glioblastoma surgical resection local radiotherapy concomitant temozolomide . This approach child still clinical assessment . In case low-grade astrocytomas , indication adjuvant therapy limit patient unresectable tumour also cause neurological lesion . Although slow grow tumour , cause severe morbidity life-threatening . Radiotherapy known side effect nervous system child . Chemotherapy use delay avoid radiotherapy patient . Most radiological study evaluate treatment response glioma focus measure area lesion . However , nowadays new image strategy functional test PET apply . The uptake 11C methionine tracer tumour tissue selective glucose provide good delineation evaluation tumour . There study molecular genetic characteristic gliomas child . In adult , report microsatellite instability predictive factor tumour response irinotecan , defect DNA repair protein result great sensitivity drug . Furthermore , adult , 30-40 % high grade astrocytomas show MGMT promotor methylation consequence methylated tumour sensitive effect alkylating drug . Due lack pediatric study MGMT promoter methylation microsatellites question whether determination importance high grade glioma adult answer . Irinotecan prodrug camptothecin family . Phase I Phase II clinical trial use irinotecan pediatric patient different neoplasias demonstrate irinotecan well tolerate . The weekly administration irinotecan cisplatin Phase I trials show treatment well tolerate dose reach 65 mg/m2 irinotecan weekly together cisplatin 30 mg/m2 weekly . The interest cisplatin/irinotecan combination brain tumour motivate previous pilot study hospital , encouraging result . This experience , together need new strategy high-risk pediatric glioma motivate conduct study . The impact study , treatment prof effective , highly significant , give poor response glioma adjuvant treatment use far . Pediatric gliomas low incidence may consider `` orphan '' disease , therefore low priority regard funding . However , unfavorable prognosis disease high clinical social repercussion , especially high grade glioma high risk low grade glioma , less mortality high incidence sequela . Other information relevant study Phase II , single arm , open label trial , conduct one institution , combination two market drug ( irinotecan cisplatin ) new therapeutic indication . Patients receive weekly 30 mg/m2 dose cisplatin 65 mg/m2 dose irinotecan ( one cycle ) , total 16 cycle . After 8 treatment cycle , Cohort 1 ( recently diagnose high-grade glioma ) Cohort 3 ( intrinsic brain stem tumour ) patient evaluate treatment response disease progression withdrawn trial receive conventional treatment radiotherapy together temozolomide ( Stupp 2005 ) . Patients disease progression time trial also withdrawn . Patients respond continue complete 16 cycle irinotecan cisplatin end continue conventional therapy . Cohort 2 ( recurrent high-grade glioma ) Cohort 4 ( high risk low-grade glioma ) patient also evaluate 8 cycle disease progression withdrawn trial , complete full 16 cycle .</detailed_description>
