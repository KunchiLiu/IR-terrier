	<brief_title>Seroepidemiologic Study Spermatozoal Transmission Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transmission hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) mother-to-infant predominant route high prevalence area China . However , father-to-child transmission also play another important role prevalence hepatitis B . Children infect HBV carrier father would horizontally postnatal intimate contact vertically via male germ line . The latter consider intrauterine infection , however , whether really exist human remain determined . In past decade , several experiment report presence integrate HBV DNA human spermatozoal chromosome . Studies embryos hybridize mammalian ovum human spermatozoon also confirm sperm-integrated HBV DNA replicate express HBV protein two-cell ' hybrid embryo . All finding demonstrate father might transmit HBV fetus spermatozoon theory . Since HBV blood-borne virus , unvaccinated pregnant woman would risk HBV exposure fetus carry virus father . On hand , maternal antibody pass placenta enter fetal circulation freely . If woman vaccinate HBV conception , thus attractive question raise would happen maternal immune system fetus carry HBV spermatozoon ? Would fetus passive immunize hepatitis B immunoglobulin leak maternal circulation ? However , literature transmission HBV spermatozoon vivo rare , viral replicating status fetal immune response uterus unknown . Only one study detect HBV DNA serological maker eight abort fetus suspect HBV transmission via spermatozoon , small sample study maternal serological status uncertain . Specimens apply evaluate intrauterine infection include amniotic fluid , placental tissue neonatal peripheral blood . Because postnatal sample inevitably contaminate maternal blood delivery , would useless determine time infection occur ( partum ) . A well alternative detect fetal infection partum prenatal diagnostic technique . Comparing postnatal specimen , intrauterine specimen obtain amniocentesis cordocentesis minimize contamination maternal blood . It also safety technique risk nosocomial infection cause invasive procedure low . The aim study investigate fetal hepatitis B seroepidemiology prenatal diagnostic technique find evidence HBV vertical transmission via spermatozoon .</detailed_description>
