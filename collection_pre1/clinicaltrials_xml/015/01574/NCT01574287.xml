	<brief_summary>Hyperparathyroidism ( excessive production parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) usually cause small growth call adenoma parathyroid gland ) increasingly significant medical public health condition . Surgery effective management primary hyperparathyroidism . However ; sometimes difficult pinpoint adenoma , part current method image often fail identify parathyroid adenoma many 30 % patient . In reoperative parathyroidectomy persistent recurrent hyperparathyroidism , localization play even great role . Unfortunately current multiple imaging method fail localize 10-15 % tumor . SPECT/CT radiotracer 99mTc sestamibi become standard method pinpoint tumor . This , however , challenge parathyroid gland usually locate close thyroid radiotracer 99mTc sestamibi concentrate thyroid parathyroid tissue . Hence need tracer/imaging tool concentrate parathyroid thyroid . A sensitive specific radiotracer/tracking agent would markedly improve investigator ability identify parathyroid tumor preoperatively , thus offer patient minimally invasive parathyroidectomy . anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC amino acid base PET radiotracer show utility detect variety tumor . In cell culture experiment , anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC show uptake parathyroid cell great thyroid cell . Therefore , investigator think radiotracer may able help u identify parathyroid adenoma well 99mTc sestamibi . The primary aim study determine anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT demonstrates uptake within parathyroid adenoma . 12 patient diagnosis primary hyperparathyroidism undergo PET-CT use anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC addition standard 99mTc sestamibi scan image clinically appropriate ultrasound , MRI , and/or contrast enhance CT scan . Since patient undergo surgery routinely , investigator compare finding surgery anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT determine radiotracer worthy study comprehensive experiment .</brief_summary>
