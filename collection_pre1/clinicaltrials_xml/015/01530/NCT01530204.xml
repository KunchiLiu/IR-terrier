	<brief_title>RAPID : Reducing Pain ; Preventing Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized ( SMART ) Trial , investigator care compare Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Pain ( CBT-P ) EXERCISE ( knee-specific Physical Therapy ) deliver individually sequentially . A subset participant receive enhance care usual primary care physicians receive information pharmacological management knee osteoarthritis . The active phase study may 16 week , follow-up period last 12 month . Stage 1 , Specific Aim 1 : To test Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Pain ( CBT-P ) result improvement pain disability receive knee-specific Physical Therapy ( EXERCISE ) . Stage 1 , Hypothesis 1 : At week 8 , subject randomize CBT-P improvement pain disability randomize EXERCISE . Stage 2 , Specific Aim 2 : For non-responders Stage 1 , explore sequence intervention lead great improvement pain disability . Stage 2 , Hypothesis 2 : Compared sequenced intervention ( see Figure ) , subject randomize CBT-P EXERCISE improvement pain disability . Follow-up , Specific Aim 3 : To explore improvement pain disability associate incident major depressive episode ( MDE ) 12 month . Follow-up , Hypothesis 3 : More pain disability improvement associate low rate incident ( MDE ) 12 month . Exploratory AIM 1 : To compare `` legacy '' assessment function psychological health Computer Adaptive Testing ( CAT ) assessments domain level agreement . Exploratory AIM 2 : To assess candidate genetic polymorphism , peripheral mRNA biosignatures , candidate cytokine growth factor level use multiplex assay individual ELISAs . The investigator explore biomarkers associate pain improvement risk develop MDE .</detailed_description>
