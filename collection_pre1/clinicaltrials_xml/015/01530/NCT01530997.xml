	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn effectiveness use lower-intensity radiation chemotherapy treat human papillomavirus ( HPV ) associate low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma head neck . The cure rate type cancer estimate high , &gt; 90 % . The standard treatment cancer 7 week radiation 3 high dos cisplatin . Sometimes surgery perform afterwards . This standard regimen cause lot side effect long term complication . This study evaluate whether low dose radiation chemotherapy may provide similar cure rate longer , intensive standard regimen . Patients study receive 1 less week radiation lower weekly dose chemotherapy follow limited surgical evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>De-intensification Radiation Chemotherapy Low-Risk Human Papillomavirus-related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim evaluate pathological response rate HPV positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) de-intensified chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) . Patients receive 54 60 Gy Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin ( 30 mg/m2 ) . Diagnostic imaging ( CT and/or MRI ) obtain 4 8 week completion CRT ass response . All patient surgical resection clinically apparent residual primary tumor biopsy primary site evidence residual tumor undergo limit neck dissection encompass least nodal level ( ) positive pre-treatment , 4 14 week CRT . The primary endpoint study rate pathological complete response ( pCR ) CRT . Longitudinal assessment quality life patient report outcome obtain prior , , CRT .</detailed_description>
