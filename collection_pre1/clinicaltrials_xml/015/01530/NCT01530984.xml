	<brief_summary>This open-label randomized phase II study . Patients randomize achieve uniform patient cohort treat regimen . Twenty-seven patient require per treatment arm , total 54 prostate cancer patient require complete study . The study assess clinical activity Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) response , single agent ipilimumab combination GM-CSF ipilimumab chemotherapy-naïve patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab GMCSF Immunotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ipilimumab antibody ( proteins find destroy foreign molecule bacteria virus ) CTLA-4 ( molecule control part immune system shut ) . It approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat patient late-stage melanoma , skin cancer . The use ipilimumab patient CRPC approve FDA . Some patient study receive GM-CSF along ipilimumab . In clinical trial , GM-CSF safely give prostate cancer patient combination ipilimumab . GM-CSF approve FDA use treatment prostate cancer . Studies patient prostate cancer suggest GM-CSF may activate immune system . Since ipilimumab help keep immune system turn allow immune reaction occur , GM-CSF increase activity immune system , possible may work together increase immune response cancer . The use ipilimumab combination GM-CSF patient CRPC approve FDA . It theorize antigen presentation could improve , immunostimulatory effect CTLA-4 blockade could augment improvement clinical response . To end , UCSF conduct phase I clinical trial ipilimumab combination GM-CSF , cytokine demonstrate enhance functional activity effector cell , include dendritic cell ( DC ) , neutrophils , monocyte , chemotherapy-naïve men CRPC ( Protocol 6032 ) .32 Exposure GM-CSF increase class II MHC expression dendritic cell think lead increase antigen presentation T cell , stimulate T cell response , although mechanism confirm . We extensively study effect treatment demonstrate dose-response relationship activation CD4 CD8 T cell . Moreover , expansion activate ( CD25+CD69+ ) CD4 CD8 T cell see GM-CSF/ipilimumab combination trial high see GM-CSF ipilimumab monotherapy see trial prostate cancer patient . We propose conduct non-comparative randomized phase II study repetitive dosing ipilimumab either alone combination GM-CSF patient metastatic CRPC . The dose interval ipilimumab base prior study demonstrate drug level ≥ 10 mg/mL ( minimum level require CTLA-4 blockade pre-clinical model ) great 28 day . Six dose ipilimumab choose six dos give safely trial . Maintenance dose every three month empirical , dose frequency base discussion Medarex , Inc. Bristol-Meyers Squibb base report indicate safety potential efficacy maintenance regimen . This study use ipilimumab give every 28 day six cycle ( induction ) follow administration every three month patient progress ( maintenance ) . A dosage 10 mg/kg chosen base result date phase I study . GM-CSF 250 mcg/m2 SQ administer day 1-14 Cycles 1-6 every 3 month 14 day begin day ipilimumab administration maintenance therapy phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm , metastatic prostate cancer ( positive bone scan and/or measurable disease CT scan and/or MRI abdomen pelvis ) . 2 . Progressive disease androgen deprivation , define PSA Working Group 237 and/or RECIST criteria.38 Patients must disease progression one following : For patient measurable disease , progression define least 20 % increase sum long diameter ( LD ) target lesion appearance one new lesion , per RECIST criterion version 1.1 For patient measurable disease , positive bone scan elevate PSA require . PSA evidence progressive prostate cancer consist PSA level least 2 ng/ml , rise least 2 successive occasion , least 1 week apart . If confirmatory PSA ( # 3 ) value great ( i.e. , # 3b ) screening PSA ( # 2 ) value , additional test rise PSA ( # 4 ) require document progression If prior orchiectomy perform , patient must remain LHRH agonist antagonist therapy . Patients receive antiandrogen part primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression follow discontinuation antiandrogen , define two consecutive rise PSA value , obtain least two week apart , document osseous soft tissue progression . At least one PSA value must obtain least four week ( flutamide ) six week ( bicalutamide nilutamide ) discontinuation 3 . Laboratory requirement : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL Platelets &gt; 100,000/μL AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min Cockcroft Gault equation Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 life expectancy &gt; 12 week . 5 . At least 18 year age old . 6 . Patients receive hormonal therapy , include dose megestrol acetate ( Megace ) , Proscar ( finasteride ) , herbal product know decrease PSA level ( e.g . Saw Palmetto , PCSPES ) , systemic corticosteroid , must discontinue agent least four week prior study treatment . Progressive disease define must document discontinuation hormonal therapy ( exception LHRH agonist antagonist ) . 7 . Prior radiation therapy must complete &gt; 4 week prior enrollment patient must recover toxicity . Prior radiopharmaceutical ( strontium , samarium ) must complete ≥ 8 week prior enrollment . 8 . Because unknown potential risk gamete and/or develop embryo investigational therapy , patient must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method male ) duration study participation , three month discontinue therapy . 1 . Prior chemotherapy prostate cancer , exception neoadjuvant chemotherapy , potential effect chemotherapy immune system . 2 . Prior investigational immunotherapy . Prior sipuleucelT treatment allow must complete least 4 week prior initiate treatment protocol . 3 . Current treatment systemic steroid therapy ( inhaled/topical steroid acceptable ) . Systemic corticosteroid must discontinue least 4 week prior first treatment . 4 . History autoimmune disease include , limited : Systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) , scleroderma , CREST syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis Inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease , primary biliary cirrhosis , autoimmune hepatitis Dermatomyositis , polymyositis , giant cell arteritis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) , cryoglobulinemia , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( APLS ) Diabetes mellitus type I , myasthenia gravis , Grave 's disease Wegener 's granulomatosis vasculitis A history Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , psoriasis , eczema , inactive least one year , isolate Raynaud 's phenomenon acceptable 5 . History radiologic evidence central nervous system metastasis . 6 . Medical psychiatric illness would preclude participation study ability patient provide informed consent . 7 . Cardiovascular disease meet one following : congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , active angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within last 6 month ) . 8 . Concurrent prior malignancy except follow : Adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer Adequately treat stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission Any cancer patient diseasefree 5 year 9 . HIV history immunodeficiency disorder . 10 . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric medical ( e.g . infectious ) illness . 11 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator make administration ipilimumab hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . 12 .
