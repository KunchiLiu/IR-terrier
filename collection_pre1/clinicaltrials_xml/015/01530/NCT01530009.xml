	<brief_title>The Effect Amoxicillin Versus Placebo Gastrointestinal Motility Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motility disorder common childhood present variety symptom include recurrent vomiting , abdominal pain distension . They often reason multiple medical visit associate significantly impair quality life severe case . There limited number available medication use improve motility stomach small bowel , include dopamine-receptor antagonist , serotonergic agent antibiotic erythromycin . Among latter group , amoxicillin-clavulanate ( AMC ) show enhance fast small intestinal motility adult child . The mechanism action currently know though theory include indirect release intraluminal mediator motilin , direct interaction β-lactam moiety γ-aminobutyric acid receptor myenteric plexus . AMC combination amoxicillin ( AMX ) clavulanic acid ( CA ) , β-lactamase inhibitor . This modification drug result broader spectrum antibacterial activity include AMX sensitive β-lactamase-producing strain . Although AMX AMC generally well tolerate , AMX associate few adverse effect due presence CA moiety AMC . AMC associate high frequency nausea , vomit transient diarrhea compare AMX . In study outpatient child , patient AMC show increased risk antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Drug-related liver injury also common patient take AMC . Furthermore , advisable use narrow spectrum antibiotic demonstrate clinical efficacy light emergence β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor-resistant bacterial strain accelerate excess antibiotic use . AMX good safety profile frequently prescribe child community physician base history physical examination alone . It recommend first line treatment common childhood illness upper respiratory infection , include ear sinus infection , community-acquired pneumonia . The goal study determine whether single dose AMX appreciable effect upper gastrointestinal motility compare placebo . In particular , induction phase III interdigestive migrating motor complex ( MMC ) AMX primary outcome study . MMCs periodic wave electrical activity result muscular contraction pass wall stomach intestinal tract fast state . It characterize initial period minimal electrical activity muscular contraction ( phase I ) , follow gradual increase frequency contraction ( phase III ) often lead characteristic cluster contraction ( phase III ) . This cycle occur fast state normal individual frequency phase III quite vary , dependent age presence underlie abnormality gastrointestinal motility . Secondary outcome include characteristic MMC , patient demographic responder non-responders , safety profile AMX intervention dose .</detailed_description>
