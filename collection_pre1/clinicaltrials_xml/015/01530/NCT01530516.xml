	<brief_summary>Class II malocclusion ( mismatch upper low jaw lower jaw appear small profile point view ) common general population . Around 1/3 population degree skeletal/dental problem one frequent reason patient decide undergo orthodontic treatment . Treatment alternative basically depend facial skeletal development patient also magnitude skeletal/dental discrepancy . For patient yet fully skeletal mature , treatment mild moderate Class II malocclusion involve combination small skeletal growth modification effect significant dental movement . For skeletal mature individual severe mismatch , treatment usually involve jaw surgery fully correct malocclusion . For less severe case orthodontic camouflage exclusively do orthodontic movement option . If case severe enough warrant surgical approach several treatment alternative . One commonly use option use orthodontic loaded spring apply force bracket arch wire bond teeth teeth interrelate well . A different alternative propose year ago . The Xbow ( spell Crossbow ) appliance differs above-proposed option bracket bond arch wire use . The orthodontic spring apply metal framework cement upper low teeth . Once skeletal/dental problem believe significantly improve , fine tune remain dental problem manage bracket arch wire . The theoretical advantage design adverse effect , root resorption decalcification long-term use bracket arch wire , theoretically minimize bracket arch wire use short period time . Although retrospective report skeletal dental effect Xbow appliance one prospective trial compare skeletal dental change non-treated grow sample ; randomize clinical trial yet evaluate change compare current standard care alternative simultaneous use load spring concurrent bracket arch wire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossbow Versus Forsus Springs Mild Moderate Class II Malocclusion Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Class II malocclusion common orthodontic problem require comprehensive treatment planning . Treatment Class II malocclusion frequently initiate mid late mixed dentition whereby crowd and/or increase jet becomes alarm patient parent . Earlier correction Class II abnormality could suggest patient significant occlusion discrepancy , increase risk trauma protrude upper incisor impairment mastication function . Among available Class II correctors , cemented/fixed option gain popularity . Systematic review shed light fix Class II correction device appear produce treatment mild moderate Class II malocclusion . Short-term change combination skeletal dental modification . Skeletal modification include maxillary restriction mandibular repositioning , dental effect usually consist inclination mandibular incisor maxillary molar distal movement . Cephalometric analysis valuable tool use diagnosis treatment plan dental malocclusion underlying skeletal discrepancy . In view fact malocclusion product interaction alignment erupt teeth basal bone skeletal position basal bone , cephalometric analysis use evaluate dentoalveolar proportion elucidate anatomic basis jaw tooth related abnormality sagittal plane . The Xbow appliance recently introduce orthodontic device use late mixed early permanent dentition full fix orthodontic treatment initiate . Its main goal rapidly correct/improve occlusion Class II malocclusion mild moderate case . Full bracket thereafter fine-tune final occlusion . Since introduction three publish study Xbow appliance . One study focus evaluation short-term skeletal dental effect lateral cephalograms another discuss low incisor inclination accord vertical facial type . Both report mandibular incisor inclination variable magnitude . The last publish study analyze conventionally utilized cephalometric variable able predict amount lower incisor inclination consistently . As mentioned , although retrospective report skeletal dental effect Xbow appliance one pilot prospective trial compare skeletal dental change non-treated grow sample ; randomize clinical trial yet evaluate change compare current standard care alternative simultaneous use load spring concurrent bracket arch wire . Objectives The present study compare 3D facial , skeletal dental change use two orthopedic orthodontic approach . Group 1 ( alternative treatment ) use fix Class II corrector - Crossbow appliance - full brace utilized later Group 2 ( one current available conventional treatment ) full fix appliance additional fix Class II corrector - ( standard care ) - clinical patient mild moderate Class II division 1 malocclusion . An additional objective compare adverse effect ( root resorption enamel decalcification ) among group . Methods Each patient undergo orthodontic clinical screening determine fill inclusion criterion ( mild moderate Class II malocclusion grow individual ) . Eligible candidate approach opportunity participate research study . After understand research purpose possible side effect , choose participate , voluntarily sign informed consent form . They randomly assign one two group . The researcher participate randomization would do statistician communicate phone participant deem fulfilled inclusion criterion provide informed consent . Both treatment arm start soon randomization do . Full orthodontic record ( digital volumetric image - Cone Beam Computer Tomograms , photos dental cast ) obtain group baseline treatment complete . Group 1 treatment consist fix orthodontic appliance ( bracket molar tube ) addition spring load orthodontic corrector occlusion level alignment complete per standard care . It expect treatment last around 24 month . Group 2 treatment consist fix functional Crossbow appliance . Bands fit low first molar , well upper first molar . A lingual vestibular arch connect low molar band , well Hyrax type rapid maxillary expansion connect upper band make laboratory . A Forsus spring connect molar tube upper first molar low vestibular arch adjustable Guerin lock . It expect Xbow treatment around 6 8 month . Fixed orthodontic appliance ( bracket molar tube ) insert thereafter regular orthodontic treatment provide expect additional completion time 12 16 month . Therefore total treatment time 24-month range . A sample 50 patient ( 25 patient per treatment group , consider 20 % loss follow-up group less 21 patient per group end study ) seek . Assumptions make SD 5 degree low incisor inclination , average previous study , clinically significant difference also 5 degree .</detailed_description>
