	<brief_summary>There many recent advance insulin treatment type 1 diabetes , however meal sugar always concern . There drug sitagliptin ( Januvia ) FDA approve treat people type 2 diabetes help correct glucose ( sugar ) meal . This study go test whether drug improve meal sugar people type 1 diabetes . To test give test mixed meal effect insulin , hormone affect blood glucose well sugar measure series blood test . Insulin dose reduce 20-50 % prevent low blood sugar might occur food stay long stomach usual due suppression hormone call glucagon increase blood sugar . If qualify give sitagliptin ( Januvia ) 3 different time 25 mg , 50 mg 100mg dosage . You researcher know dose take single visit . A total 30 people child age 13- 17 others adult age 18-30 participate . Some diabetes year , others within 3 month find type 1 diabetes . Furthermore , 18-30 year people diagnose type 1 diabetes year study initially ( 4 subject ) establish safety data young subject enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Dose Determination Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Sitagliptin extensively study patient type 2 diabetes mellitus , documented study literature establish safe efficacious dose type 1 diabetes mellitus . Our previous experience exenatide , GLP-1 agonist also similar end pharmacological effect Sitagliptin relate publish study suggest avoid immediate post-prandial hypoglycemia insulin dose need reduce patient administer glucagon suppressor conjunction insulin . Hence , dose insulin decrease 20-50 % Sitagliptin administer . Sitagliptin give three different dos T1DM subject within 3 month diagnosis also group subject &gt; 1 year diagnosis . A paired crossover design study aim establish effective glucose-lowering dose additionally minimize side effect . Furthermore , 18-30 year old subject diagnose T1DM year study initially ( 4 subject ) establish safety data young subject recruit study . The data un-blinded completion first two adult subject order analyze preliminary data also reapply fund . Data Safety Monitoring Board meet initiation study child enrol study . The safety data meeting submit IRB review . Specific Aim : To establish safe effective glucose-lowering dose Sitagliptin type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) use along rapid act insulin normalize post-prandial hyperglycemia reduce hyper-glucagonemia delay gastric emptying . Hypothesis : A dose-response effect Sitagliptin observe gastric empty glucagon suppression new establish subject T1DM . Study Design : Following informed consent ( appropriate subject assent ) , subject TIDM undergo 5 study visit : Screening , Part A ( Sitagliptin 25 mg ) , Part B ( Sitagliptin 50 mg ) , Part C ( Sitagliptin 100 mg ) , Part D ( Placebo ) . A randomized double-blinded trial 4-period crossover design use establish ideal Sitagliptin dose adult age group ( 18-30 year ) . The adult study subject 's study staff ( except one person ) blind dose Sitagliptin study Parts A , B , C D random order . Montefiore Medical Center ( MMC ) Investigational pharmacy one study staff ( exclude PI ) un-blinded protocol randomization table , dispense , check dose study medication schedule study visit ( do study staff person ) . For pediatric age group ( 13-17 year ) single blind trial single ascend dose sequential study . Pediatric study subject 's blind dose Sitagliptin start placebo part proceed study part Sitagliptin 25 mg , 50 mg 100 mg dose sequential order . The participant admit CRC four occasion Parts A , B , C D admission 3-4 week apart . Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria Subjects T1DM age group 12-30 year without concomitant illness except treated hypothyroidism recruit also HbA1C le 9 % . Menstruating woman must negative pregnancy test . Lactating pregnant woman exclude anyone anemia define Hemoglobin le 12 gm/dl . Also , subject history substance abuse ( evaluated medical history CRAFFT questionnaire administer screen visit ) exclude . The subject 's medication affect blood sugar . Screening : After sign consent form , screen evaluation perform 28 day prior study enrollment CRC Parts A , B , C D. The evaluation consist medical history , physical examination ( include height , weight , vital sign tanner stag ) , blood sample clinical laboratory test : CBC , LFTs , amylase , lipase , creatinine HbA1C . The approximate volume blood drawn expect 12 ml . CRAFFT questionnaire administer . Also subject Dexcom™ Continuous Glucose Monitoring System insert . It three part - glucose sensor insert subcutaneously , transmitter connects sensor electrode attach body receiver display glucose value . It get update every 5 minute . The subject need wear 7 day . Also , ask keep log diet , insulin exercise wear CGMS . We try schedule next visit 7 day period CGMS admit glucose level relatively stable . We give extra sensor instruction wear case come next visit week . Part A : The subject admit CRC around 6:30 AM . Vitals take . IV place blood drawn measure Stat CBC , HbA1C , Liver function test , Serum Amylase , Serum Lipase Serum Creatinine . Study continue Hemoglobin great 12 gm/ dl . Urine pregnancy test do female subject prior study . Insulin infusion subcutaneous pump continue long act analog , glargine give per home regimen . BLOOD SAMPLING AND MEDICATIONS : At approximately 0700 baseline blood sample draw prior study start : glucose , insulin , glucagon , GLP-1 , DPP-4 activity Sitagliptin . Also , blood draw follow time point : -240 min , -180 min , -60 min , 0 min , 4 hr . prior mixed meal 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 , 240 , 360 min . The insulin pump basal rate ( glargine ) set continue per home regimen . Sitagliptin 25 mg administer point . At around 1100 ( 0 min ) , pre-breakfast insulin bolus rapid acting insulin give 0 min . The insulin dose base patient 's usual insulin carbohydrate ratio . This dose reduce 20-50 % subject offer standard liquid meal Boost High Protein Drink , 12 Oz . ( 360 calorie , 50 g carbohydrate 12 g fat ) ask consume within 10-15 minute period . This enrich 1 gram [ 1- 13C ] glucose . Expired 13CO2 determined breath -240 , 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 , 240 , 360 min . Lunch provide 240 min insulin bolus rapid acting insulin give insulin pump ( calculate accord subject 's insulin carbohydrate ratio sensitivity factor ) insulin injection . They stay 2 hour 360 min blood draw . Blood glucose concentration measure bedside use Analox glucose analyzer . Sitagliptin 24 hr medication pk data obtain 0 360 min . For safety reason subject 's put Dexcom CGMS wear week . During period keep log sheet note blood glucose , food exercise activity . They return use prepay envelope provide . The subject discharge . They pay separately transportation , park child care . A social security number require . It keep confidential . For minor , compensation give parent , intend child . A subject withdrawn participate study he/she meet follow condition : 1 ) develop chronic disease 2 ) develop anemia 3 ) become pregnant 4 ) develops weight loss great 10 pound unspecified reason 5 ) loss contact- unable reach study subject ( within 2 month screen completion first study ) phone mail schedule next appointment . All study subject ( withdrawn study ) receive phone call letter notify withdrawn . Blood sample keep 20 year assays develop hormone analysis . Since difficult perform clinical study pediatrics , feel well bank blood sample perform hormone analysis newer assay become available rather repeat study . Treatment Hypoglycemia : If blood glucose value subject less 55 mg/dl , IV glucose 5-10gm , blood glucose le 50 mg/dl , 10-15 g administer counter low blood glucose achieve euglycemia ( 90-130 mg/dl ) . 1-2 dos IV glucose correct hypoglycemia . If 3-4 dos require achieve euglycemia , study terminate subject offer meal tray blood sugar rechecked ensure euglycemia . After completion first 2 study subject , data safety monitoring committee assess safety protocol , well drug dose adjustment protocol make . If hypoglycemia occur even reduce dose insulin , reduction insulin dose advise . The total blood draw volume 175.4 cc ( 3/4 cup ) Part A , B , C 121.4 cc ( 1/2 cup ) Part D. Each study 3-4 week apart . Prior part , hemoglobin must &gt; 12 g/dl female subject test negative pregnancy . Part B : Will identical part A except Sitagliptin dose 50 mg. Part C : Will identical part A except Sitagliptin dose 100 mg. Part D : Will identical part A except study subject receive placebo . In Parts B , C , D urine pregnancy test do visit female subject . Also Part A , B , C , D subject Dexcom™ Continuous Glucose Monitoring System 7 day send back u use prepaid mailing envelope . Statistical Analysis Power Calculation : Data earlier trial determine mean area curve ( AUC ) child T1DM insulin alone 470 mg*hr/dl . The current trial design detect 20 % difference mean AUC glucose 300 min period 376 mg*hr/dl . In previous study , r &gt; 0.7 noted repeat measure ( subject ) standard deviation excursion measure AUC approximately 30 % . With specification necessary sample size 11 subject . With 40 % drop rate would need total 15 subject TIDM . Power calculation base alpha 0.5 power 80 % two-tailed test . To stratify recent onset Vs establish onset recruit 15 ( n = 30 ) . Data Analysis : AUC determine glucose 300 min time period 4 study two-tailed , repeated measure analysis variance perform . A modified paired t-test use post hoc multiple comparison . Regression analysis use calculate dose response curve individual hypothesis hold true significance 0.05 . Similar analysis also carry insulin glucagon . The pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin analyze model dependent model-independent mean . AUC , plasma clearance , half-life steady state volume distribution among parameter determine . Pharmacokinetic data analyze use ADAPT II software . The initial curve fit perform weight least square algorithm . Other strategy invoke appropriate .</detailed_description>
