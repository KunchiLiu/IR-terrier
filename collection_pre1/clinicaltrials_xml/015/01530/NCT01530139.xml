	<detailed_description>To achieve Food4me aim , investigator undertake large multi-centre proof-of-principle study carry across 7 EU country option delivery personalise nutrition . Recruitment Centres Recruitment Food4Me intervention study carry use identical protocol 7 centre across EU involve total 1,288 study participant i.e . 184 participant per country . The Proof-of-Proof Principle study centre involve recruitment : - University College Dublin , Ireland . - University Maastricht , Netherlands . - Universidad de Navarra , Spain . - Harokopio University , Greece . - The University Reading , Uk - National Food Nutrition Institute , Poland . - Technische Universitaet Muenchen , German . Study design Then , proof-of-principle centre recruit sample 184 participant 46 subject randomly assign follow level personalise nutrition : - Level 0 : Control group - receive non-personalized dietary advice improve food choice base standard population healthy eat guideline . - Level 1 : Personalised dietary advice base dietary intake data alone . - Level 2 : Personalised dietary advice take dietary intake phenotypic data account . - Level 3 : Personalised dietary advice take dietary intake , phenotypic genotypic data account . The study design mimic fully Internet deliver personalized nutrition service . The route recruitment via Internet mimic real life condition `` proof-of-principle '' study . However , ensure adequate recruitment scientific study , recruitment study participant also base local national advertising service internet , radio advertisement , advertisement , use social medium face face meeting . Only participant age 18 year age include study . A minimal set exclusion criterion apply ( subject 18 year old , pregnant lactating , limited access internet , follow prescribe diet reason , include weight loss last 3 month , Insulin dependent diabetes , celiac disease , Crohn 's , metabolic disease condition alters nutritional requirement , diabetes . Other balance male female ratio among recruit ( 70/30 30/70 distribution male female group ) balance age ratio ( 70/30 30/70 distribution participant &lt; 45 year &gt; 45 year old group ) stratification apply since objective complete proof-of-principle study real set possible . All age sex stratification apply randomisation participant level / group personalise nutrition ( 0 , 1 , 2 3 ) .</detailed_description>
