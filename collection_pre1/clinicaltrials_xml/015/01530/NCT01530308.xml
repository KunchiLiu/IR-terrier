	<detailed_description>To address aforementioned objective , propose multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Eligible patient and/or proxy verbally inform investigator content study , benefit risk , receive patient information folder nature study ( version number , see appendix ) . The time consider participation trial 4 hour maximum . Subsequently , patient and/or proxy ask informed consent . Subjects screen delirium-risk executive investigator administrate three delirium-risk question patient care-givers , recommend Dutch Safety Management ( VMS ) program : 1 . Do memory complaint ? 2 . Did need help activity daily live past 24 hour ? 3 . During previous illness hospital admission ( ) , period confusion ? One positive answer identify at-risk patient . Eligible patient assign daily intervention either low-dose haloperidol ( oral dosage 1mg , twice-daily 12pm 8pm ) placebo stratify randomization . The maximum intervention duration 7 day . Hospital admission course non at-risk patient accord three VMS delirium-risk question retrospectively assess medical chart review . Different study measurement collect admission . A baseline ECG standard ED laboratory do . Two additional blood sample 10ml drawn ( one admission one admission day 4 ) determine haloperidol plasma level store future research . The investigator assess baseline cognitive- physical functioning admission different questionnaire observational measure : 6-item cognitive impairment test ( CIT ) , 6-item Index Independence Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) , 8-item Instrumental Activities Daily Living scale ( IADL ) Informant Questionnaire Cognitive Decline Elderly ( IQCODE-N ) . The presence delirium ED establish accord CAM-ICU DSM-IV criterial . During admission , subject receive 'high standard delirium care ' base effective non-pharmacological delirium intervention method . Additionally standard ward round , investigator visit patient least day 2 , 4 , 8 ( extend ) physical examination evaluate possible side-effects relate intervention . According protocol , ECG perform least 24 hour ( 2 dos ) 72 hour ( 6 dos ) first intervention dose , possible end study intervention period request investigator . An ECG repeat 24-hour time-interval every dose steady state reach , QTc &gt; 420ms-500ms baseline ECG , QTc prolongation &gt; 25 % baseline , case QTc prolonging drug use . If QTc ≥ 500ms , study medication discontinue . A list QTC prolong drug contraindicate use haloperidol ( 1st degree drug interaction , reason action ) available warning system implement medication prescription system . Development delirium symptom study evaluated Delirium Observation Screening ( DOS ) scale , administer 3 time per day . When delirium suspect base mean DOS scale score &gt; 3/24 hour , diagnosis establish accord DSM-IV criterion either geriatrician psychiatrist . In case establish delirium within 7-day initiation study intervention , administration assign intervention stop since one primary endpoint ( i.e . incidence ) reach . Unblinding perform immediately ( 24-hours day , 7 day week local hospital pharmacy VUmc , procedures argumentation record ) , treat physician decide treatment patient ' delirium . Nursing staff perform DOS score 3-times daily ass duration delirium , accord protocol . In addition , investigator ass delirium duration severity DRS-R-98 once-daily . Both DOS scale DRS-R-98 perform delirium symptom resolve participation study longer possible due example transfer facility , ICU/CCU admission death . If delirium symptom develop within 7-days initiation study intervention , administration assign intervention treatment stop ( 14 dos ) . Further admission course evaluate retrospective analysis patient ' chart . In patient discharge home within 7-days initiation study intervention , study medication aim stop day discharge since take approximately 12 - 38 hour eliminate half originally administer oral haloperidol dose . These patient subject en extended physical examination day discharge evaluate possible side-effects related intervention , possible . The independent physician researcher contact question time . At end study , subject ' chart review one investigator . During follow-up period , investigator contact subject and/or proxy telephone , respectively 3- 6-months hospital discharge , evaluate physical function time ADL IADL scale , cognitive function 6-item CIT . Also , information hospital re-admission ( ) , need additional ( health ) care ( permanent ) institutionalization hospital discharge death report . Each telephone conversation take estimate 20 minute .</detailed_description>
