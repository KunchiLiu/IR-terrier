	<brief_title>Second Line Therapy Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary tract adenocarcinoma uncommon tumor poor prognosis median overall survival ( OS ) rarely exceed 6 month . Less 25 % patient resectable diagnosis , even subset patient , relapse rate high . An improvement OS quality life patient receive chemotherapy versus best supportive care demonstrate advanced disease . Recently , cisplatin gemcitabine combination identify new standard first-line chemotherapy , yield median progression free survival ( PFS ) median OS 8.5 11.7 month , respectively . Despite outcome improvement , disease progression constant approximately half patient fail upfront treatment good performance status willing undergo treatment . No standard salvage chemotherapy regimen identify . Clinical trial difficult perform due rarity heterogeneity tumor lack interest pharmaceutical industry . Fluoropyrimidines mitomycin C consider basis palliative chemotherapy long time . The investigator decide explore activity , term PFS , capecitabine alone combine mitomycin C second-line therapy patient pathological diagnosis advance biliary tract cancer progressive disease gemcitabine cisplatin , mean open label randomize multicentric phase II trial .</detailed_description>
