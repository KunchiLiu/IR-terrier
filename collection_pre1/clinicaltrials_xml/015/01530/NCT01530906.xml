	<brief_title>Efficiency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Bulimia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive outpatient technique brain stimulation , base delivery localize magnetic field . It widely use variety neurological psychiatric disorder . Several clinical pathophysiological study suggest efficacy rTMS reduction crave and/or addictive behavior various addiction alcoholism , smock cocaine . Because addictive design BN , effect one session rTMS food craving test . These study show stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DPLPFC ) high frequency decrease crave food . In addition , healthy subject , study show rTMS appear alter neuropsychological function involve physiopathology bulimia . To date , investigator know rTMS cold useful treatment treatment bulimia . But light data , investigator hypothesize program rtMS may therapeutic effect therefore interest treatment bulimia . The objective project ass whether program repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) high frequency leave DLPFC reduces bulimic symptom short term . This french multicenter study ( Montpellier , Marseille , Saint Etienne ) , randomize , single blind , two arm , addition treatment already validate ( prescription selective inhibitor serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) ) . The two arm : one arm SSRI + rTMS arm SSRI + sham rTMS ( placebo ) , 30 patient per group recruit . The methodology include : 1. initial clinical neuropsychological assessment . 2 . 10 TMS session 20 train 5 55s interval cross train , frequency 10 Hz 110 % motor threshold intensity leave DLPFC . Fifty percent patient real stimulation fifty percent sham stimulation . Subjects randomize one two group . During first last session food challenge task administer rTMS . Salivary cortisol level assess throughout protocol . 3. final clinical neuropsychological assessment 1 month ( 15 day minimum last Session rTMS ) . The primary endpoint focus number binge within 15 day last session rTMS . If investigator hypothesis confirm investigator highlight new therapeutic modality treatment bulimia . The secondary objective permit good understand pathophysiology disorder way possible therapeutic action rTMS</detailed_description>
