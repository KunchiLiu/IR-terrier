	<brief_summary>It known diet ( restrict energy intake ) without resistance training lead reduce metabolic rate , loss fat muscle mass . When exercise include period restrict energy intake , degree muscle mass lose highly dependent upon protein consumption . Whey protein high quality protein isolated milk know stimulate new protein synthesis proteins body . Previous research establish consumption whey protein correlate retain muscle mass stimulate fat loss . However , mechanism behind finding still unknown . The purpose study establish mechanistic underpinning efficacy whey protein versus soy protein carbohydrate control ( maltodextrin ) , promote fat mass loss lean mass retention period short-term controlled dietary energy deficit ( -750 kcalories/day ) .</brief_summary>
