	<brief_summary>Sustained improvement pulmonary rehabilitation activity level measure activity armband . Pulmonary rehabilitation utilize improve exercise capacity , quality life prognosis patient suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . There also strong evidence support use pulmonary rehabilitation decrease hospital admission thereby reduce cost care . Recent study suggest significant benefit achieve rehabilitation fade time order improve activity daily live ; example , average daily number step , programmes long duration require . The primary aim study identify objective sustain improved activity level use SenseWear activity armband short-term pulmonary rehabilitation programme . Secondary aim determine antibiotic steroid use pre post rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterise airflow limitation systemic airway inflammation . Together feature lead decrease physical activity turn worsen patient 's dyspnoea . In patient COPD , physical activity level low compare healthy control indeed low patient chronic condition arthritis diabetes . For patient COPD , decrease physical activity breathlessness significant predictor mortality morbidity . By reverse deconditioning pulmonary rehabilitation use supervise home exercise program lead increased exercise capacity health quality life score . In order benefit pulmonary rehabilitation sustain long-term essential change patient 's physical activity home life . While practice guideline recommend transference exercise home set unknown happens reality . Addressing whether increase physical activity home pulmonary rehabilitation focus study . Physical activity measure number way , include direct observation , patient diary questionnaire , one successful performance base motion sensor pedometers accelerometer . One performance base motion sensor SenseWear accelerometer . The SenseWear previously use patient COPD , show reliable measure physical activity perform population , use rolators objectively accurate questionnaire diary . The hypothesis study pulmonary rehabilitation lead sustain improvement physical activity patient COPD . Physical activity measure daily average activity record SenseWear armband several time point year course pulmonary rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
