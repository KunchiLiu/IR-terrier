	<detailed_description>The study population healthy male ( age 50-75 year ) elevate risk cardiovascular ( CV ) disease . A target 60 participant require complete study total 70 subject target ( n=70 subject * ~85 % anticipated completion rate = 60 subject complete study ) . This placebo-controlled study test relative efficacy 4 different flavonoid sub-classes ( ( ) flavan-3-ol , ( ii ) anthocyanin , ( iii ) flavanone ( iv ) isoflavone ) . Accordingly , subject randomise one four flavonoid study group ( ( ) ( iv ) outline ) , consume follow treatment random order : 1. dietary flavonoid + placebo supplement 2. placebo food + commercially available/produced flavonoid supplement 3. placebo food + placebo supplement Additionally , isoflavone metabolite feed establish potential vascular effect . Each sub-class assess separately 1 week wash-out period treatment observe . At assessment visit , vascular function assess pre- post-intervention , subsequent assessment make coincide anticipated peak plasma concentration . Dietary intake monitor study participant require adhere range dietary lifestyle restriction within 3 day assessment reduce potential confounding data assessment interest . A standard battery vascular function test perform intervention group , assessment visit perform identical manner .</detailed_description>
