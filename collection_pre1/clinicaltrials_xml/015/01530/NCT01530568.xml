	<brief_title>Gene Xpert Diagnosis TB Using Tracheal Aspirates From Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Tuberculosis ( TB ) serious global public health emergency great need improvement current diagnostic tool evaluation new novel technology rapid diagnosis TB . The common testing method TB sputum smear microscopy , remain largely unchanged sophistication sensitivity . Smear microscopy detects around 50 % active TB case capable identifying drug resistance . Furthermore , even though culture accurate result available several week . Treating patient empirically TB expose patient toxic side-effects drug , response treatment , raise question MDR-TB . These consideration apply clinical decision-making ICU TB infrequently encounter . A diagnosis TB set important implication drug-drug interaction , route administration , drug toxicity . The Gene Xpert® system 's MTB/RIF Assay , on-demand molecular test simultaneous detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) rifampicin ( RIF ) resistance , recently release . This system combine on-board sample preparation real-time PCR [ 1 ] . Helb colleague develop perform first analysis Cepheid Gene Xpert System 's MTB/RIF assay . They evaluate diagnostic utility system use sputum sample show system highly sensitive simple-to-use [ 2 ] . A recent paper ( NEJM , 2010 , press ) enrol almost 2000 patient find Xpert sensitivity almost 90 % smear-negative TB . However , test perform use tracheal aspirate unknown . It also unclear whether test impact ICU decision treat often make clinically empiric treatment initiate . To address question aim obtain tracheal aspirate 120 mechanically ventilated patient suspect TB Groote Schuur Hospital Intensive Care Unit . Tests conduct Lung Infection Immunity Unit laboratory ( Groote Schuur Hospital , Cape Town ) evaluate diagnostic utility Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay group patient . The expected study period 12 month .</detailed_description>
