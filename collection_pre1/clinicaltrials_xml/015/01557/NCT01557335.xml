	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Platlet Aggregation Clopidogrel , EC Aspirin 81 mg , EC Omeprazole 40 mg Compare PA32540</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PA32540 propose secondary prevention cardio- cerebrovascular event patient risk develop aspirin-associated gastric ulcer . Aspirin 81 mg take concomitantly clopidogrel 75 mg maintenance dose standard care patient cardiovascular disease . The combination aspirin clopidogrel , however , significantly increase risk bleed event . To mitigate upper gastrointestinal bleeding event , patient would require use proton pump inhibitor . For reason , reference arm study use PrilosecÂ® 40 mg comparator - proton pump inhibitor dose level . The primary objective evaluate adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation follow administration clopidogrel , EC aspirin 81 mg EC omeprazole 40 mg , dose concomitantly , PA32540 clopidogrel dose separately</detailed_description>
