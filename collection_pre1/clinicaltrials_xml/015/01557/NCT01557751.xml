	<brief_summary>In preparation future large-scale genome wide association study , reliable method must develop measure perceive pain estimate effect potentially confound factor appropriate covariates . The major objective pilot investigation develop optimal method characterize primary endpoint studyâ€”knee pain , gather preliminary data genetic marker human genome associate certain pain phenotype . The specific issue study carry preliminary gene association analysis acute perioperative pain individual undergoing total knee replacement define pain phenotype compose multidimensional domain opioid consumption , inflammatory marker , anxiety level , degree catastrophizing , etc . This pain phenotype sensitive enough pick change pain experience attribute single nucleotide polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In spite advance postoperative management standardization postoperative care , wide variability degree pain relief achieve account . The aim study devise method define pain phenotype sensitive enough detect difference genetic makeup individual undergo standard surgical procedure ( total knee replacement ) . This methodology serve pilot study future genome wide association study . Given multidimensional aspect pain experience , phenotype combine various dimension comprise postoperative pain . Reports single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , account variability pain , report literature use different pain model . To test sensitivity method phenotyping , investigator aim determine variability clinical phenotype explain SNPs publish literature . Patients schedule elective unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty ask report various clinical pain variable , fill psychometric questionnaire , subject quantitative sensory testing , genotyped gene associate pain , additional SNPs . A composite pain profile compose patient initially examine five candidate gene relate SNPs find SNPs significantly associate give pain phenotype . Samples bank future study gene associate pain . Other clinical variable collect ( e.g . opioid consumption ) . At six twelve month , psychological questionnaire pain questionnaire send patient . A model use pain physical therapy dependent variable fit data . Knee joint fluid , urine , serum collect approximately 30 % subject provide additional consent cytokine inflammatory marker analysis . All biological specimen bank future analysis . This pilot , preliminary study ass patient prospectively attempt correlate marker gene single nucleotide polymorphisms patient phenotype . This method serve foundation future genome wide association study pain . This preliminary , developmental , prospective follow-up study develop tool sensitive specific enough used large-scale candidate genome association pain study .</detailed_description>
