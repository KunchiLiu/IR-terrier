	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Anti-melanoma activity Ipilimumab single therapy association melanoma peptide show well synergy radiation therapy anti-CTLA-A mAb several tumor animal model local tumor control distant effects.Radiotherapy increase tumor immunogenicity several preclinical model increase MHC molecule expression able induce significant tumor reduction around 30 % case . Thus , combine radiotherapy administration ipilimumab could elicit systemic antitumor response . Radiation therapy expose tumor-associated antigen ( TAA ) facilitate antigen presentation , blockade CTLA-4 could amplify immune antitumor response . In therapeutical model , use patient tumor source tumor antigen ( opposition vaccination protocol , TAA exogenic ) particularly adapt . PURPOSE : This Phase I trial determines side effect best dose radiation therapy administer combination ipilimumab .</brief_summary>
