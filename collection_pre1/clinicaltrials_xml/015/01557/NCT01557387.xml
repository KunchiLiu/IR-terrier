	<brief_summary>Significance : Biopsy potentially benign pseudopolyps surround mucosa add expense prolongs time endoscopic procedure . Use endoscopic technology could decrease need expense endoscopic biopsy lesion . Hypothesis : Pseudopolyps distinctive pattern specialize image technique high definition imaging , narrow band imaging , endoscopic dye-spraying technique use indigo carmine predict diagnosis without biopsy . 100 patient inflammatory bowel disease enrol study . Following standard bowel preparation , patient evaluate use standard endoscopic equipment . All patient receive standard bowel preparation ( sodium phosphate , PEG-3350 , magnesium citrate base preparation ) . All colonoscopic evaluation perform indication unrelated present study , include evaluation response medical treatment , routine surveillance exam dysplasia , diarrhea , rectal bleeding . Polypoid lesion examine use four consecutive method : ( ) high definition white light , ( b ) narrow band imaging , ( c ) chromoendoscopy ( high definition white light indigo carmine dye-spraying ) , ( ) histologic examination follow biopsy . The flat mucosa surround polypoid lesion also examine use thesis four technique effort identify dysplastic tissue associate polypoid growth . High definition white light standard image modality use colonoscopy . Narrow band imaging ( blue wavelength light ) also use routinely available current generation colonoscope press button . Our division routinely use chromoendoscopy part surveillance dysplasia patient inflammatory bowel disease . Dye spray catheter flush utilized dye application mucosa . The dye use indigo carmine . Directed biopsy specimen perform use multibite forceps target biopsy . Routine biopsy perform clinically indicate . Pathology slide review gastrointestinal pathologist University Miami . The gastroenterologist 's interpretation base three successive endoscopic method compare histologic evaluation individual lesion serve control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The colonoscopy biopsies do standard care ; additional biopsy take research purpose detail . All image technique part accept standard care follow : high definition white light , narrow band imaging , chromoendoscopy , histologic examination follow biopsy . Comparison predictive value image modality predict histology biopsy underlies primary question research protocol . Cost analysis modality versus histology also perform . Time use individual modality record . Subjects identify one investigator outpatient clinic visit inpatient University Miami Hospital . Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion schedule undergo colonoscopy standard care purpose ask participate study . Patients 18 year age confirm diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease plan routine colonoscopic evaluation able provide inform consent include .</detailed_description>
