	<brief_summary>Background : - Bone marrow stromal stem cell ( also know mesenchymal stem cell ) isolate find make large amount growth factor . Because make growth factor , cell help re-grow tissue encourage repair damage tissue . Tests damage heart muscle suggest inject cell directly damage heart muscle improve heart function . Researchers want give stem cell people open heart surgery see help repair heart muscle damage . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness bone marrow stromal stem cell injection give heart surgery treat heart muscle damage . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age schedule open heart surgery heart artery vein blockage . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample also collect . - Participants bone marrow take hip bone 3 week heart surgery . - During surgery , stromal stem cell collect bone marrow give damage portion heart muscle . The rest heart surgery perform accord standard procedure . - After surgery , participant monitor complication stromal stem cell . - Participants heart function test see stromal stem cell treatment effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Many investigator believe bone marrow-derived stem cell endothelial progenitor cell recruit incorporated tissue undergo neovascularization , include cardiac tissue . Stem cell include hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) , endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , mesenchymal stem cell / stromal stem cell ( MSCs ) , myoblasts , undifferentiated side population cell use alternative therapeutic strategy ischemic cardiovascular disease treat routine interventional approach . In porcine pre-clinical study find cell survive intramyocardial injection differentiate vascular cell , smooth muscle endothelial cell . Functional analysis regional wall motion ejection fraction demonstrate statistically significant improvement function cell treat animal six week compare baseline sham control . A variety study conduct subject coronary artery disease use different cell type rout administration . This study first kind administer autologous BMSC via direct intramyocardial injection rigorous clinical trial U.S . Objectives : To evaluate safety feasibility direct intra-myocardial injection autologous bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) adult subject undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) . A secondary objective ass whether direct intra-myocardial injection autologous bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) improve patient cardiac function , quality life , reduce cardiac event compare historical control three six month intervention . Eligibility : Adult subject three-vessel coronary artery disease plan undergo CABG TMR NIH Heart Center Suburban Hospital willing participate , stable angina , LV EF less equal 50 % , evidence hypokinetic segment . Subjects exclude recent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , bleed disorder , infection , HIV unable wait 3 week surgery cell expand prior injection . Design : Bone marrow aspiration perform subject suffer ischemic heart disease depress leave ventricular function three week admission CABG TMR NIH Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic . Data present base subject treatment regimen : Group 1 CABG+Cells ( total 10 evaluable subject ) Group 2 TMR + Cells ( total 10 evaluable subject ) The autologous MSCs isolate marrow aspirate , culture expand vitro 3 passage ( approximately 21 day ( +/- 4 day ) ) Clinical Center Cell Processing Laboratory ( CPS ) , locate Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) , Clinical Center , NIH . During surgery Suburban Hospital , MSCs inject directly ischemic area CABG TMR . Patients assess functional improvement pre , 3 , 6 , 12 60 month surgery transthoracic echocardiography and/or MRI pre , 3 6 month surgery . Toxicity data report time surgery 6 month surgery , unless late toxicity occur relate cell injection .</detailed_description>

Reversible ischemia leave ventricular free wall coronary artery disease correspond region myocardial ischemia . 3 . In region myocardium , coronary disease must amenable coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) , due : i. severe diffuse disease , ii . lack suitable target complete revascularization , iii . lack suitable conduit complete revascularization Stable Angina . Patient ? clinical state stable receive surgical treatment . Patients must receive currently receive standard care medical therapy ( 33 ) least 4 week prior enrollment , include : 1 . Aspirin absence contraindication patient prior MI 2 . Betablockers initial therapy absence contraindication patient prior MI . 3 . Lipidlowering therapy patient document CAD LDL cholesterol great 130 mg/dL , target LDL le 100 mg/dL 4 . ACE inhibitor patient CAD ( consider significant angiography previous MI ) also diabetes and/or leave ventricular systolic dysfunction . Threevessel CAD .
