However , think mode feeding might increase amount fluid enter bowel contribute symptom diarrhoea . An alternative strategy feeding , give large volume shorter space time resemble normal feed pattern may reduce amount water enter bowel . In study want use non invasive medical imaging technique call `` magnetic resonance imaging '' ( MRI ) look volume bowel water follow two feed strategy 12 healthy volunteer . Each volunteer tube insert stomach via nose undergo two feed strategy least 7 day apart .

	<brief_title>Effects Bolus Continuous Nasogastric Feeding Small Bowel Water Content Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background . Nutritional support often require undernourished patient unable meet daily nutritional requirement . This often due lack consciousness problem swallow , Nasogastric ( NG ) feed often employ provide active enteric nutritional support . The current approach deliver support usually involve pump-assisted continuous feed spread throughout course day . However , practice far physiological may promote excessive secretion fluid small bowel , contribute gastrointestinal symptom frequently experience NG feed patient . Rarely , continuous enteral tube feed associate small bowel ischaemia necrosis , although observation almost always make critically ill. Bolus feed give large volume short time period replicate pattern normal feeding . Consequently gastric empty use method slow may , therefore , reduce metabolic demand small intestine prevent excessive accumulation small bowel fluid . 2 . Aims . This study aim investigate influence bolus continuous NG feed small bowel fluid content superior mesenteric blood flow . Our hypothesis bolus NG feeding result low small bowel fluid secretion reduction superior mesenteric artery blood flow comparison individual bolus NG fed . 3 . Experimental protocol method . This single-centre , cross-over study involve 12 healthy volunteer . Two study undertake volunteer approximately 7 day apart : - Tube bolus ( TB ) : feed administer via NG tube 5 min . - Continuous tube drip feeding ( TD ) : feed pump deliver via NG tube 4 h. The sequence treatment allocation conceal assessor intervention , data collection , statistical analysis complete . Subjects ask arrive 8:30 a.m. Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance 1.5T , University Nottingham , abstain alcohol , caffeine-containing drink , medication least 24 h prior study , well fast overnight . An 80 cm 8FR Freka ( Fresenius Kabi , Runcorn , UK ) fine bore nasogastric ( NG ) tube insert stomach via nose well cannula ante cubital fossa blood sampling . The position NG tube verify magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Once tube sit , volunteer ask sit 5 min order allow tube settle body adapt presence . Following NG intubation subject undergo baseline MRI scan blood sample glucose , insulin PYY . Feeding commence time 0 . Scanning blood test proceed 30 min interval total 4 h. The feed use study 400 ml Resource® Energy Vanilla nutrient drink ( Nestle Nutrition , Société des Produits Nestlé S.A ) , typical standard oral supplement . In TB study arm supplement administer NG tube via syrinx 5 min ; TD study feed administer use pump rate 100 ml/h 4 h. 4 . Measurable end points/statistical power study . Primary endpoint : Small bowel water content ( SBWC ) . Secondary endpoint : Superior mesenteric artery blood flow , gastric content empty time , plasma concentration glucose , insulin peptide YY ( PYY ) . Previous work use mannitol glucose indicates mean ( SD ) SBWC 40 minute postprandially ingest 300ml glucose 47 ( SD 15 ) use n=10 calculate detect difference 17 ml ( 36 % ) interventions 90 % power . We plan recruit 12 allow dropout .</detailed_description>
