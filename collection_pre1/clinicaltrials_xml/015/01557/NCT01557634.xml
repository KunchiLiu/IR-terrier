	<brief_summary>The incidence type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) increase worldwide evidence rapid increase preschool child . Intensive control blood glucose level , although essential protect onset progression diabetes-related complication , face unique challenge toddler preschool child . A closed-loop system enhance accuracy insulin delivery help people T1D attain tight glucose control avoid risk hypoglycaemia . The main component system continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) , insulin pump computer-based 'model predictive algorithm ' , calculate amount insulin give insulin pump accord CGM value . In study perform thus far efficacy safety closed-loop glucose control evaluate child adolescent age 6 18 year . The result show closed-loop improve control blood glucose prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia , compare conventional insulin pump therapy . The objective current study extend evaluation closed-loop young child age 2 6 year , may gain great benefit novel therapy . The present study adopts open-label , randomise , 2 period cross-over design whereby closed-loop insulin therapy use dilute insulin ( 20IU/ml ) compare closed-loop standard insulin ( 100IU/ml ) 12 young child T1D . Participants age 2 6 year randomise two overnight study clinical research facility , glucose level control either computer-based closed-loop algorithm use diluted insulin closed-loop standard insulin . On occasion , participant receive self-selected evening meal closed-loop run 17:00 08:00am follow day . The study take place Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility , Cambridge participant recruit paediatric diabetes clinic England .</brief_summary>
