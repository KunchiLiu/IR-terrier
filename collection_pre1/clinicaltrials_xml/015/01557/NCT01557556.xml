	<brief_summary>Background : - Stressful situation often cause tobacco craving . These craving make difficult smoker try quit . Research show craving may involve hormone pathway brain . The anti-anxiety drug pexacerfont act hormone pathway . Researchers want see pexacerfont act brain lessen stress-related tobacco craving smoker try quit . Objectives : - To test effect pexacerfont tobacco crave smoker want quit smoking . Eligibility : - Smokers 18 55 year age try quit . ( Participants must smoke least 10 cigarette per day least 1 year . ) Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants assign take either pexacerfont placebo . They take three pill every morning first 7 day , one pill every morning 23 day . - At first visit , participant provide blood urine sample . They ask prepare 5-minute speech give study researcher . They also ask mental math problem another 5 minute . During test , blood pressure , heart rate , sweating , skin temperature measure . Participants fill questionnaire stress level , tobacco craving , personal experience . - Participants take study pill 30 day . Before 2-week point , participant ask try quit smoke 2 week . - Participants four study visit . These visit involve brain imaging scan emotional stress test . Tobacco craving stress level measure study . Blood urine sample may collect study . - Participants follow-up visit phone call 6 month end study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate pexacerfont , orally available , brain-penetrant selective CRF1 antagonist , ability modulate emotional motivational process daily smoker seek quit smoking . Study population : We collect evaluable data 60 adult , great equal 10 cigarette per day smoker smoke first cigarette within one hour waking report Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) wish quit smoking . Design : Participants randomly assign one two group receive 30 day oral pexacerfont ( 300 mg/day load dose 7 day , follow 100 mg/day maintenance dose 23 day ) match placebo double-blind condition . On Day 15 16 , subject two day test evaluate reactivity stressful/neutral stimulus without presence smoking cue . Reactivity test term physiological parameter , subjective report , nicotine reinforcemen , smoke resistance paradigm functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) signal rest response stress/cue-related task . In addition , last 14 day study drug administration , subject attempt stop smoking . Daily assessment smoke behavior obtain . Finally , day 26 27 , participant two day test evaluate reactivity stressful/neutral stimulus . Reactivity test term physiological parameter , subjective report , cue reactivity paradigms functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) signal rest response stress/cue-related task . Outcome measure : Outcome measure laboratory session include nicotine reinforcement , latency lapse smoke resistance paradigm , subjective rating stress , mood , tobacco craving , autonomic response ( galvanic skin response , heart rate , blood pressure ) , endocrine response ( salivary cortisol salivary ( alpha ) amylase , measure endogenous adrenergic activity stress ) , fMRI BOLD signal rest response stress/cue-related task . Outcome measure quit attempt include , change consumption , number lapse , latency lapse .</detailed_description>
