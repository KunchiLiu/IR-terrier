	<brief_summary>Numbness , tingle , pain hand foot follow administration chemotherapy ( also call chemotherapy-induced neuropathy ( CIN ) ) common problem oncology patient . However , information need patient develop neuropathy impact mood , ability function , quality life . In addition , effective treatment problem available present time . This study conduct two part . In Part 1 , patient finish chemotherapy develop CIN evaluated determine patient patient develop CIN . In addition , impact CIN patient ' mood , function , quality life evaluate compare patient ' report important outcome measure . In addition , genetic marker contribute protect development CIN evaluate . Part 2 study test effect new treatment call photon stimulation ( also call infrared light therapy ) compare placebo treatment improve sensation foot oncology patient CIN . Patients receive photon stimulation great improvement sensation foot compare receive photon stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design two part . Part 1 use `` extreme phenotype '' approach evaluate phenotypic genotypic characteristic chemotherapy induce neuropathy ( CIN ) sample oncology patient complete chemotherapy ( n=400 ) ( n=200 ) develop CIN . Patients without CIN match , 2 1 ratio , cancer diagnosis CTX agent administer ( i.e. , platinum compound , taxane , ) . Patients recruit cohort 30 40 insure match criterion meet 2:1 ratio achieve . In single study visit , take place outpatient CTSI CRC ( CCRC ) Mt . Zion , participant enrol , complete battery sensorimotor test questionnaire , provide single blood specimen genomic analysis . Part 2 pilot study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( RDBPCT ) photon stimulation sample patient ( n=142 ) CIN participate Part 1 . Participants randomize receive active treatment placebo series 8 treatment , last 7 minute , across 14-day period . Participants assess baseline 2nd , 4th , 6th , 8th treatment sensory , motor , balance , pain intensity pain quality measure , mood , quality life measure . Blood specimens draw treatment day 1 , 4 , 5 , 8 gene expression . 10.1 * Study design : 10.2 Check</detailed_description>
