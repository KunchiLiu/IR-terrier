	<brief_title>Multi-day ( 3 ) In-patient Evaluation Intradermal Versus Subcutaneous Basal Bolus Insulin Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The single center , open-label , 2 period crossover study randomize route ( intradermal versus subcutaneous ) patient Type 1 diabetes . Subjects receive insulin , basal bolus dosage , via intradermal ( ID ) subcutaneous ( SC ) infusion set three day period . Each subject participate 3 visit : Screening Visit ( V1 ) , follow 2 experimental intervention day ( V2 V3 ) start 2 - 21 day screen visit . The minimum/maximum interval study day shall 5 28 day . Each subject remain clinic approximately 3 day experimental intervention . A final exam perform end Visit 3 . After successful screen enrollment subject admit clinic . Their insulin pump infusion set replace investigational system , commercially available insulin pump either intradermal infusion set ( Research Catheter Set , BD ) subcutaneous infusion set ( Quick Set , Medtronic ) include in-line pressure transducer/recorder insulin NovoRapid . The initial pump infusion rate establish base patient 's know basal infusion rate meal bolus insulin estimate base patient 's know insulin sensitivity . An intravenous ( vein ) catheter line establish , blood glucose measure least every 2 hour overnight insulin correction implement , deem necessary . The overnight pre-prandial ( meal ) target range 70-160 mg/dl , although procedure continue plan patient outside range . It goal give IV glucose insulin , change basal insulin setting least 2 hour meal . The breakfast meal high GI ( 60g carbohydrate ) solid meal , consume within 15 minute follow period 6 hour blood sample glucose insulin level . Lunch serve standardized mixed meal , follow period 4-6 hour . This procedure repeat day 2 3 whereas breakfast lunch meal well insulin dose cover meal . A light evening dinner serve every day , composition insulin dose record . On day three 4 hour period follow lunch catheter remove , catheter site assessment document ultrasound observation infusion site ( skin thickness SC ) versus adjacent control site perform within 10 min removal infusion set . Glucose rescue , necessary , administer orally ( juice , 200 mL ) . Insulin correction boli deliver via investigational infusion set .</detailed_description>
