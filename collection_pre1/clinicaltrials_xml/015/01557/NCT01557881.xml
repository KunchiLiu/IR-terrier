	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study positron emission tomography ( PET ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient undergo PET/computed tomography ( CT ) . Diagnostic procedure , PET/MRI , may help doctor diagnose cancer help doctor predict patient 's response treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To acquire PET/MRI scan 100 patient compare PET/CT scan subject . The PET/CT scan use provide gold standard evaluate image quality quantitative performance PET/MRI scan . After comparison evaluation image capability performance sequential PET/MRI imaging system 100 subject , second cohort hundred consecutive subject may necessary comparison make current standard PET imaging , PET/CT . This validation attenuation correction method quantitative accuracy PET/MRI device compare PET/CT continuous iterative process result optimize performance PET/MRI key step become available clinical research project within Seidman Cancer Center well institution . OUTLINE : After undergo standard PET/CT , patient undergo PET/MRI .</detailed_description>
