	<brief_summary>Phase II study use Proton radiation therapy treat male , age 18 year old , Stage I , IIA IIB Seminoma . This research study do conjunction Robert H. Burr Proton Therapy Center Mass . General Hospital Department Defense . In feasibility portion study patient evaluate determine acute toxicity . If study deem feasible principal investigator ( PI ) hop proton RT reduce lethargy rate compare photon radiation therapy ( RT ) .</brief_summary>
