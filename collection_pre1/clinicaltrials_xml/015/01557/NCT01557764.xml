	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study effectiveness lapatinib ditosylate ( lapatinib ) together trastuzumab treat patient HER2-negative breast cancer carry HER2 gene mutation . Lapatinib may kill tumor cell block enzymes need cell division growth . Trastuzumab , monoclonal antibody , may block ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving lapatinib together trastuzumab may provide effective treatment patient type cancer .</brief_summary>
