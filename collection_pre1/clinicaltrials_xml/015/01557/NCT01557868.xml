	<brief_title>Prediction Response Intra-articular Injections Hyaluronic Acid Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee debilitate condition affect estimate 21 million Americans . This number expect rise steadily population age . The medical expenditure associate arthritis rheumatic condition United States increase $ 50 billion 1997 $ 86 billion 2003 . In 2003 , almost 420,000 total knee replacement perform , primarily arthritis . Injections hyaluronic acid ( HA ) show provide symptom relief many OA patient fail respond conservative intervention . Many patient , however , experience slight improvement . The result study allow physician identify whether patient likely likely respond well HA therapy lead improved treatment success rate . Goals This study two related goal : 1 ) identify patient treatment factor predict response intra-articular injection hyaluronic acid knee osteoarthritis use multivariable analysis 2 ) develop mathematical statistical model predict individual patient response HA knee OA . It anticipate investigator develop computer software study support clinical decision making related viscosupplementation treatment knee OA . If project yield successful patient predictive model , physician consider trial HA patient empirical basis treatment selection . Eventually physician would able ass relatively small number variable patient provide prediction regard treatment response . **Please note study site Naval Medical Center Portsmouth , Virginia enroll patient eligible treated military facility .</detailed_description>
