	<brief_summary>Patients stage IIIB IV lung adenocarcinoma progression first-line chemotherapy enrol receive afatinib 40 mg/day . Mutational EGFR HER-2 status assess RT-PCR . HER2 amplification evaluate FISH . Plasma HGF level measure ELISA 2 month ( mo ) start treatment . We assess change serum HGF level association objective response rate ( ORR ) , PFS overall survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With BIBW 2992 , Irreversible Inhibitor EGFR HER-2 Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer main cause cancer-related mortality worldwide , account 1.6 million death 2012 . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) histology comprise ap-proximately 85 % case . At time diagnosis , 75 % patient locally advance metastatic disease , 5-year survival rate le 5 % . Although treatment option patient remain limited , drug target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) prove highly effective therapy NSCLC patient harbor sensitize EGFR mutation . Afatinib , second-generation irreversible TKI , confers theoretical advantage re-versible TKIs patient acquire resistance . Through covalent bind kinase domain EGFR , afatinib regulates signal homodimers heter-odimers form ERBB receptor family member include EGFR , HER2 ( ErbB2 ) , HER3 ( ErbB3 ) HER4 ( ErbB4 ) . HER2 mutation NSCLC rare , find approximately 1-4 % lung adenocarcinoma . In contrast reversible TKIs , mechanisms resistance irreversible TKIs fully elucidate , identification biomarkers predict response drug , particularly patient progress first line therapy , need . In study ass usefulness plasma HGF concentration predictor response afatinib patient advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis lung cancer nonsmall cell ( stage IIIB IV ) inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic , histologically cytologically document . The patient must present evidence measurable disease . 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy least 12 week . lung cancer patient advance nonsmall cell , stage IIIB / IV receive least one cycle systemic chemotherapy standard platinumbased firstor secondline fault document treatment . admissible 3 prior chemotherapy regimen . Patients must recover toxic effect pass least 2 week last dose prior registration ( 14 day vinorelbine vinca alkaloid gemcitabine ) . Patients opinion investigator fully recover surgery 4 week least , also consider study . Patients must recover severe toxicity ( CTC ≤ 1 ) cause previous therapy . granulocyte count ≥ 1.5x 109 / L platelet count &gt; 100 × 109 / L. serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN AST / ALT ≤ 2 ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN clearly attributable presence liver metastasis ) . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min Ability comply study procedure monitor . Of woman childbearing potential obtain negative pregnancy test within 72 hour start therapy . Patients reproductive potential must use effective contraception . Written informed consent ( sign ) participate study . Any unstable systemic disease ( include active infection , grade 4 hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , liver disease , renal metabolic ) . Pretreatment systemic antitumor therapy EGFR inhibitor ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) . Any malignancy within previous 5 year ( except carcinoma situ cervix skin cancer adequately treat basal cell type ) . Excluded patient brain metastasis spinal cord compression newly diagnose / definitively treat surgery / radiation , support patient CNS metastases spinal cord compression previously diagnose treated evidence stable disease ( clinically stable image study ) minimum 2 month . Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality , especially severe syndrome dry eye , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , Sjogren 's syndrome , severe keratitis exposure condition may increase risk corneal epithelial damage . We recommend use contact lens study . The decision continue use contact lens discuss treat oncologist patient 's ophthalmologist . Patients unable take oral medication , require intravenous nutrition , undergone prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulceration . lactate woman .</criteria>
