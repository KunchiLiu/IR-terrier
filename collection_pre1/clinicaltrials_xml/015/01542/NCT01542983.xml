Improvement domains sleep fatigue might result overall improvement QOL . The investigator show woman breast cancer symptom cluster poor sleep , fatigue depressive symptom chemotherapy likely manifest increase severity symptom decrease QOL chemotherapy . A randomized control treatment study warrant examine whether concurrent treatment sleep fatigue , begin chemotherapy continue chemotherapy , prevent deterioration sleep fatigue chemotherapy , since poor sleep fatigue relate mood , whether improvement lead improvement symptom cluster sleep/fatigue/mood well QOL cognitive functioning chemotherapy .

Aim 2 - QOL Cognition : To examine effect concurrent treatment poor sleep fatigue , begin start chemotherapy continue chemotherapy , cognitive functioning ( measure target neuropsychological test battery ) QOL chemotherapy ( hypothesis 2 : Women newly diagnose breast cancer treat concurrently BBTI morning BLT start chemotherapy , experience less deterioration cognitive function good QOL chemotherapy woman information-only control group ) . The innovation large application study intervention dual modality intervention ( BBTI BWL ) , previously study combination ultimately seek shift clinical practice paradigm reactive proactive , preventive cancer care model . The investigator propose clinical trial treat patient , whether currently experience problem sleep fatigue , goal prevent ameliorate severity symptom chemotherapy , compare information-only control group ( IC ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . This pilot study help u determine feasibility study .</detailed_description>
