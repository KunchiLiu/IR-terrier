	<detailed_description>Background : Currently , guideline clinical practice differ considerably respect use anticoagulant treatment arthroscopy knee . Trials carry aim efficacy , small sample size therefore mainly use asymptomatic thrombosis endpoint . From trial overall risk benefit-balance could establish , hence current controversy exists . In propose study use relevant symptomatic endpoint large cohort patient . Furthermore follow subject adverse event long period , assess long term sequela event . Lastly , determine high risk group benefit anticoagulant treatment . Objective : Comparative effectiveness research determine cost-effectiveness exist healthcare policy , i.e . treatment low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) arthroscopy knee . In addition investigate personalize prophylaxis base genetic acquire risk factor . Study Design : A randomized control trial comparing policy anticoagulant LMWH policy anticoagulant patient underwent knee arthroscopy . Determination genetic acquire risk factor perform start study . Based presence absence factor assign risk profile patient Study Population : The study population consist 1500 patient undergo knee arthroscopy . These patient recruit 6 hospital Leiden/Den Haag region two-year inclusion period . All patient 18 year eligible , except patient contra-indication absolute indication LMWH use Intervention : LMWH ( example nadroparin 2850 IE s.c. daily , &gt; 100kg 5700IE sc ) 8 day vs treatment . Each hospital use LMWH accord preference . Blood take pre- post-operatively analyzed common single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) know strongly affect thrombotic risk ; level coagulation factor plasma ( high low level know increase risk ) . Patients also screen acquire risk factor thrombosis questionnaire . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : We compare two standard treatment mode currently use depend physician 's hospital 's preference . The patient trial subject one standard treatment . It therefore expect participation lead increase health risk . LMWHs like Nadroparin Dalteparin experimental pharmaceutical ; register Netherlands indication since 1989 . Not participate trial may , depend physician , still lead treatment LMWH . All patient need undergo two venepunctures blood sample study . These blood sample take pre-operatively post-operatively . No extra hospital visit require . Patients contact electronic questionnaire 2 week 6 week arthroscopy knee telephone three month . One questionnaire concerning risk factor thrombosis , bleed patient demographic fill arthroscopy knee . Only subject clinically relevant adverse event ( similar random sample subject without clinically relevant adverse event ) monitor two year period event ( total expect 30 subject ) . After six month , one year two year event , patient see clinical examination quality life assessment mean questionnaire .</detailed_description>
