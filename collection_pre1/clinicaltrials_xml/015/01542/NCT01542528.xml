	<brief_title>Integrated Brain , Body Social Intervention Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) neurodevelopmental disorder characterize failure develop age-appropriate executive function . Children ADHD struggle sustain direct attention , inhibit response task-irrelevant stimulus contain regulate impulsive behavior . ADHD interfere healthy emotional cognitive development . It often negative impact child 's academic performance also peer family relationship . Medications widely use treat ADHD US . However , evaluate another approach . Based nearly 30-years research scientist Yale China , Integrated Brain , Body , Social ( IBBS ) Intervention ADHD combine computer-presented brain exercise physical education curriculum , design fun , well enhance sustain attention , inhibitory control executive capacity . Work investigator also show computer exercise design specifically address aspect neurocognitive dysfunction ADHD lead improvement work memory sustain attention ; however IBBS first intervention combine advance computer game sport activity . IBBS school-based program group 10 child ( Kindergarten , First , Second grader ) alternate classroom setting ( 45 min ) gymnasium ( 45 min ) four day week 15 week . These mixed age group compose child ADHD , child at-risk ADHD , typically develop child . Although IBBS take place group setting , computer game component individualize instruction maximize benefit child . Since social context clear impact expression ADHD , also incorporate `` Good Behavior Game '' ( GBG ) group activity . The GBG intend facilitate group participation enhance co-operative interaction classroom gymnasium . The use GBG another innovative feature IBBS . Thus far , preliminary result show IBBS lead fundamental increase cognitive ability focus attention . We conduct randomize trial determine IBBS effective treatment ADHD two culturally distinct setting ; Hamden , Connecticut Beijing , China . A subgroup child Hamden also participate brain imaging study IBBS .</detailed_description>

Presence serious behavioral problem ( tantrum , aggression , selfinjury ) another treatment warrant could disruptive group treatment setting . Significant medical condition injury identify school personnel ( would normally identify issue school nurse , physical education teacher , child 's primary pediatrician ) would prohibit limit child 's ability perform physical activity component IBBS ( e.g . uncontrolled asthma musculoskeletal injury condition . ) Any restriction previously identify child 's pediatrician school personnel , course , follow .
