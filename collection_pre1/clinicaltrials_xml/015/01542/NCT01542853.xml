	<brief_summary>MRI shove little correlation clinical finding treatment spondylodiscitis ( infection vertebra and/or disc ) . Since PET/CT almost good MRI diagnose spondylodiscitis hypothesis study PET/CT well predict residual disease patient spondylodiscitis . Preliminary study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value PET/CT Diagnosing Residual Disease Patients With Spinal Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last year report increase incidence spondylodiscitis . The increase mainly think cause increase elderly population increase amount spinal instrumentation population . The symptom range backache severe neurological deficit . Up 1/3 case report culture negative case therefore difficult diagnose . MRI think main imaging technique visualise infection . But increase availability 18-F FDG PET/CT , report nearly efficient diagnose spinal infection . During long antibiotic treatment spondylodiscitis , clinician real good imaging technique predict residual disease since MRI remodelling fase spine mimic difference worsening . Since 18-F-FDG PET mark area high amount inflammatory cell may also faster return normal image therefore correlate well actual status MRI . Some purpose study therefore : - To describe change PET/CT MRI index 4 , 8 12 26 week compare clinical finding well inflammatory biomarkers . - To investigate correlation normalisation inflammatory biomarkers change MRI PET/CT .</detailed_description>
