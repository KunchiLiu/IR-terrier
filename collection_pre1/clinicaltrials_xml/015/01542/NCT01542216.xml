	<brief_summary>With increased success breast cancer therapy , survivor develop unhealthy change body composition , muscle loss fat gain , lead increase risk cardiovascular disease diabetes survivorship . This study examine effect nutrition , cardiovascular strength exercise program compare yoga program ( represent usual care ) body composition metabolism recently diagnose breast cancer patient . Nutrition exercise may improve various body composition metabolic parameter , may improve quality life survivorship , reduce risk recurrence reduce risk develop cardiovascular disease diabetes survivorship .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Nutrition Metabolism Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite increase success novel anti-neoplastic therapy , breast cancer patient receive chemotherapy develop unfavourable change body composition , include lean tissue loss fat gain ( 1,2 ) . These detrimental change associate poor quality life ( 3,4 ) may lead treatment complication ( 5,6 ) cancer trajectory . In non-malignant population , fat gain muscle loss associate increase risk cardiovascular disease diabetes ( 7 ) . Cancer survivor gain fat lose lean mass predispose disease also increase risk cancer recurrence ( 3 ) . Proper nutrition well exercise independently improve metabolic profile ( i.e . immune function , lipid glucose metabolism ) overall health outcome non-malignant population ( 7-9 ) . While exercise enhance quality life breast cancer patient ( 4 ) , overall nutritional need metabolic benefit exercise unclear patient group . Understanding effect nutrition exercise intervention breast cancer patient form basis future study program integrate nutrition , exercise , metabolism reduce cancer recurrence morbidity survivorship . This study examine effect nutrition exercise intervention body composition metabolism recently diagnose breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
