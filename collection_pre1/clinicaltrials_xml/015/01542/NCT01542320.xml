	<detailed_description>PROBLEM OF INTEREST : Lactic acid bacteria know probiotic give child adult prevent treat gastrointestinal infection maintain intestinal health . This pilot study collect information ( biomarkers ) inflammation immune response healthy infant . HOW THE PROBLEM WILL BE STUDIED : The investigator give active Lactobacillus-containing probiotic inactive placebo without Lactobacillus 38 healthy infant metropolitan Atlanta area 2 week 2 week complete rotavirus vaccine series . Half assign receive active probiotic , half receive placebo . Neither investigator parent/ guardian study subject know whether infant receive probiotic placebo . A teaspoon blood stool sample collect infant start take active probiotic placebo 2 week complete rotavirus vaccine series . Each infant receive probiotic placebo product 2 week start rotavirus vaccine series 2 week complete rotavirus vaccine series . The blood stool sample examine level inflammatory marker measure immune response . The stool sample may store later study probiotic bacteria well bacteria virus . These result help determine Lactobacillus contain probiotic effect immune response inflammation healthy infant . HOW RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND HUMAN HEALTH : This study provide new information impact give Lactobacillus-containing probiotic supplement healthy infant . CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE : The current standard care infant receive probiotic discretion caregiver . By study probiotic administration control way fix dose schedule well categorize probiotic , measure blood stool marker , investigator hope good understand impact probiotic immune response inflammation .</detailed_description>
