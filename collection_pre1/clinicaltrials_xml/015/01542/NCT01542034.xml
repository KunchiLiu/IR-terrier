	<criteria>1 . Submental fat grade investigator 2 3 use ClinicianReported Submental Fat Rating Scale ( CRSMFRS ) grade subject 2 3 use PatientReported Submental Fat Rating Scale ( PRSMFRS ) determine Visit 1 ( within 28 day randomization ) . 2 . Dissatisfaction submental area express subject rating 0 , 1 , 2 use Subject Self Rating Scale ( SSRS ) determine Visit 1 ( within 28 day randomization ) . 3 . Males nonpregnant , nonlactating female 18 65 year age , inclusive , day randomization ( Visit 2 ) . Females childbearing potential must negative human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test result within 28 day Visit 2 agree practice adequate contraception , judgment investigator , course study . Females childbearing potential sexually active need practice contraception . 4 . History stable body weight , judgment investigator , least 6 month randomization . 5 . Expected understand agree comply visit schedule protocolspecified test procedure agreement subject refrain making significant change , judgment investigator , dietary exercise habit course subject 's participation . 6 . Agreement forego treatment behavior ( e.g. , unshaven facial hair ) subject 's participation study may affect assessment submental area . 7 . Medically able undergo administration study material determine clinical laboratory test obtain within 28 day randomization investigator identify clinically significant abnormality . 8 . Signed informed consent obtain studyspecific procedure perform . 1 . History intervention treat submental fat ( e.g. , liposuction , surgery , lipolytic agent ) . 2 . History trauma associate chin neck area judgment investigator may affect evaluation safety efficacy treatment . 3 . A Submental Skin Laxity Grade ( SMSLG ) 4 anatomical feature ( e.g. , predominant subplatysmal fat , loose skin neck chin area , prominent platysmal band ) , assess within 28 day randomization , reduction submental fat may , judgment investigator , result aesthetically unacceptable outcome . 4 . Evidence cause enlargement submental area ( e.g. , thyroid enlargement , cervical adenopathy ) localize submental fat . 5 . Body mass index &gt; 40.0 determined Visit 1 . 6 . History current symptom dysphagia . 7 . A result coagulation test ( PT , PTT ) obtain within 28 day randomization indicate presence clinically significant bleed disorder . 8 . Any medical condition ( e.g. , respiratory , cardiovascular , hepatic , neurological disease , thyroid dysfunction ) would interfere assessment safety efficacy compromise subject 's ability undergo study procedure give inform consent . 9 . Treatment radio frequency , laser procedure , chemical peel , dermal filler neck chin area within 12 month randomization . 10 . Treatment botulinum toxin injection neck chin area within 6 month randomization . 11 . History sensitivity component study material 12 . History sensitivity topical local anesthetic ( e.g. , lidocaine , benzocaine , procaine ) . 13 . Previous randomization study previous participation Kytherasponsored ATX 101 trial . 14 . Treatment investigational device agent within 30 day randomization . 15 . For center select conduct magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluation , subject presence condition would render subject unsuitable MRI evaluation ( e.g. , claustrophobia ) , metal body would interfere MRI acquisition ( e.g. , nonremovable metal appliance mouth silver gold cap , pacemaker , metal joint ) .</criteria>
