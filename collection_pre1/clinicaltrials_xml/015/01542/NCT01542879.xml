	<brief_summary>A research study diagnosis spread disease child diagnose solid tumor use new whole body image technique new MR contrast agent ( ferumoxytol ) . Standard test use determine extent possible spread child 's disease include magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , compute tomography ( CT ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) well bone scan , metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) scanning . The purpose study determine new imaging test refer whole body diffusion-weighted MR whole body PET/MR detect extent spread disease accurately even well standard test ( CT , MR and/or PET/CT ) . The advantage new image test associate significantly reduce radiation exposure compare standard CT PET/CT image test . The result whole body MR PET/MR compare conventional , standard image study tumor detect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Development Radiation Free Whole Body Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Imaging Technique Staging Children With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New development magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technology provide alternative radiographic stag technique . Novel whole body ( WB ) diffusion weight MR scan ( WB-DW-MR ) provide high tumor-to background contrast , similar 18F-FDG PET scan . Therefore , study design compare sensitivity whole-body MR 18F-FDG PET detect metastatic disease child malignant lymphoma malignant sarcoma . Recently , integrated whole body PET/MRI technology propose compromise radiation-free WB-DW MRI ( provide information tumor metabolism ) PET/CT , associate high radiation exposure . Pediatric patient newly diagnose malignant lymphoma , malignant sarcoma solid tumor , schedule undergo clinical image tumor staging , also undergo WB-DW-MR integrate 18F-FDG PET/MR staging procedure prior , treatment . Following intravenous injection ferumoxytol ( Feraheme ) and/or 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) , WB-DW-MR scan integrate 18F-FDG PET/MR scan obtain simultaneously 3T PET/MR system acquisition time 60-90 minute . Very young patient would need anesthesia sedation study exclude order keep initial research exam minimally invasive . Two experience pediatric radiologist determine presence , location size primary tumor metastases separately WB-DW-MR , 18F-FDG PET/MR study 18F-FDG PET PET/CT scan . The presence absence tumor lesion confirm histopathology clinical image follow-up least one year standard reference .</detailed_description>
