	<brief_summary>This study design investigate possibility use two similar distinct drug use together treatment advance cancer might prove less toxic either agent use alone , dosage reduce agent . This phase I study design measure frequency level specific side effect Carboplatin Pazopanib use combination advance cancer patient . The possibility anti-tumor activity occur also go investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Combination Pazopanib Carboplatin Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pazopanib show promising anti-cancer activity single agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Activity multiple tumor renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) neuroendocrine tumor document , recently gain FDA approval treatment metastatic kidney cancer . Also , impressive activity single agent recently report non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) neoadjuvant setting , tumor shrinkage occur 86 % patient . Encouraging activity also see cervical cancer , ovarian cancer soft tissue sarcoma . Multi-kinase target approach may prove beneficial number patient population . In particular cancer breast , colon , pancreas etc. , patient represent heterogeneous population small group base genetic analysis . Some population may benefit multiple agent give similar , distinct target action . Dosages therefore associated toxicity might reduce approach .</detailed_description>
