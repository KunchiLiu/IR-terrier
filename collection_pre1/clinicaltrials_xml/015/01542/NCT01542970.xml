	<brief_summary>The incidence allergic disease increase worldwide last decade . Initially , lot effort put elucidate know risk factor commonly associate development allergic disease early life cause increase . Studies show reduced incidence allergic disease former socialist country comparison country `` Western lifestyle '' show risk factor allergen exposure , environmental pollution tobacco exposure also present society less affluent lifestyle . This suggest disappearance factor protect development allergic disease affluent environment.The development allergic disease begin first year life eczema , non-IgE- IgE-associated , food allergy , progress childhood development asthma bronchiale , also non-IgE- IgE-associated , later development allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , i.e . atopic march . The immune system neonate influence maternal immunity , via placenta breast milk . Thus , immunological interaction mother offspring close pregnancy lactation . The association cord blood IgE level maternal paternal atopic heredity , may depend possibly strong placental Th2 shift atopic mother . Thus , factor influencing/protecting development allergic disease early life , would important already pregnancy , birth early postnatal life . Two major hypothesis assess last decade : Proper microbial stimulation , include establishment gut flora infancy relationship low omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acid western diet incidence allergic disease . This double blind randomize study . Families least one parent/sibling clinical symptoms/history allergic disease invite participate study . Pregnant mother include study 20th week gestation . They randomize 4 study group , one receive placebo capsule , second receive omega-3 PUFA supplementation placebo regard L. reuteri , third receive L. reuteri placebo regard omega-3 PUFA fourth group receive omega-3 PUFA L. reuteri supplementation . Omega-3 supplementation give mother pregnancy lactation L. reuteri give mother pregnancy later child first year life.The child clinically follow allergy nurse regularly . Questionnaires regard data environment , sibling , pet , breast feeding , smoking exposure , upper respiratory infection clinical symptom allergic disease fill regularly . Skin prick test ( SPTs ) perform child 6 12 month milk , egg , wheat , peanut cat . At 24 month , timothy birch allergen extract add . A pediatrician ass child 24 month life whenever need study period . Dietary habit assess pregnancy ( 25th gestational week ) 6 month child birth . Blood sample child take cord blood 6 , 12 24 month life . Maternal blood sample take 20th week gestation child birth . Milk sample collect 1-4 day partus monthly first 4 month lactation . Maternal gastrointestinal function address validated diary card . Saliva child fecal sample mother child also collect accord follow protocol .</brief_summary>
