	<brief_title>Comparison Cost-Effectiveness Coronary CT Angiography Versus Myocardial SPECT Patients With Intermediate Risk Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause heart failure Westernized country account one common cause mortality Korea . More importantly , nation 's health cost spend treatment CHD . Therefore , select right patient intervention become important . The diagnosis treatment strategy CHD rely anatomic functional imaging . First , significant narrow segment coronary artery second , must also evidence ischemia due lesion . As consequence recent , rapid development distribution high-resolution compute tomography ( CT ) , physician refer patient anatomic image coronary vasculature coronary CT angiography ( CCTA ) . CCTA advantage image coronary artery noninvasively nearly exact conventional , invasive coronary angiography . However , CCTA also possibility overdiagnosing CHD , especially intermediate lesion . This important give recent outcome FAME study demonstrate inferiority rely anatomic diagnosis . In contrast , myocardial single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) advantage image ischemia accurately , since functional image anatomical imaging . However , sensitivity specificity le 80 % , mean total 20 % patient false-negative false-positive . In addition , although demonstrate ischemia , provide much coronary artery stenotic . Recently , van Werkhoven Bax demonstrate CCTA myocardial SPECT may complementary . The study show patient abnormal CCTA myocardial SPECT result tend bad term event-free survival patient either alone . However , nation 's cost may burdenful patient charge test together thus , critical give information cost-effectiveness test . In study , aim compare cost-effectiveness CCTA myocardial SPECT patient intermediate pre-test probability CHD . To end , patient intermediate pre-test probability CHD randomize 1:1 either CCTA myocardial SPECT . The patient analyze cost also , outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must ≥30 year old ≤80 year old . Subject able verbally confirm understandings risk , benefit diagnostic alternative receive CCTA SPECT . He/she his/her legally authorize representative provide write informed consent prior study related procedure . Subject must intermediate probability coronary artery disease assess appropriate criterion write . The patient previously diagnose significant coronary artery disease previously ( ≥50 % stenosis ) previously intervene significant coronary artery disease ( PCI CABG ) . The patient prior history myocardial infarction . The patient high pretest probability coronary artery disease . The patient history impair renal function , i.e . CRF ARF . The patient allergy iodinate contrast agent . Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy &lt; 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) , i.e . malignancy .</criteria>
