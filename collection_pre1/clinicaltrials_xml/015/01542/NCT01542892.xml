	<brief_summary>Several trial find nutritional supplementation elicit increase rate skeletal muscle protein synthesis follow single bout exercise young old individual . However , study investigate nutritional supplementation exercise cause sustain increase physical function fat free mass , particularly old adult functional limitation . This study compare effect nutritional supplement versus placebo exercise training induce change physical function old adult risk mobility disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise Intervention : Participants complete exercise session 3 time per week 6 month . The exercise session involve walk , low extremity strength exercise , flexibility , balance training . Supplement Intervention : Participants randomly assign receive either nutritional supplement placebo . The participant consume beverage immediately exercise session . Primary Outcome : The primary outcome time walk 400 meter , express average gait speed 400 M walk . All participant must able walk 400 meter &lt; 15 minute walk normal speed . The 400 M walk assess baseline , 3-months , 6-months , change 6-months primary outcome . Secondary Outcome Measures : - Stair Climb Test - Body Composition - Skeletal muscle cross sectional area - Isokinetic/Isometric peak torque/power - Hand-grip strength - Nutritional status - Quality Life/Depressive symptom Expected enrollment : 150 ( 80 Tufts University ( Boston , MA , USA ) , 70 University Uppsala ( Uppsala , Sweden ) )</detailed_description>
