	<brief_summary>- For prevention spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) patient liver cirrhosis , norfloxacin 400mg per day standard regimen . - Ciprofloxacin 750 mg per week also know effective prevention SBP . In addition , ciprofloxacin weekly administration convenient less costly . - Therefore ciprofloxacin weekly could useful efficacy comparable norfloxacin daily . - This study aim prove ciprofloxacin weekly administration effective norfloxacin daily administration prevention SBP cirrhotic patient ascites .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Norfloxacin Versus Ciprofloxacin Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis ( SBP ) Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) one serious complication liver cirrhosis . The short term mortality reach 20-30 % mainly due sepsis , hepatorenal syndrome , liver failure . In addition , patient suffer SBP show poor prognosis 1 year-mortality 50-70 % . The high recurrence rate also problematic . Therefore appropriate prevention SBP critically need improve survival well quality life . Selective intestinal decontamination ( SID ) eradicate gram negative bacterial gut lumen , effectively prevent development SBP . Patients gastrointestinal hemorrhage , low ascitic protein level , high bilirubin , history SBP need SID . Norfloxacin 400 mg daily administration decrease incidence SBP 2 % compare 17 % prevention group 's among patient ascitic protein less 1.5 g/dL . Also , high risk patient ( Child-Pugh score &gt; = 9 point serum bilirubin level &gt; = 3 mg/dL , serum creatinine level &gt; = 1.2 mg/dL , blood urea nitrogen level &gt; = 25 mg/dL , serum sodium level &lt; = 130 mEq/L ) , norfloxacin 400 mg/day improve 1 year-survival 60 % compare 48 % prevention group 's . Therefore norfloxacin primarily recommend prevention SBP cirrhotic patient . However , norfloxacin administer daily basis , effort reduce cost frequency make . Ciprofloxacin 750 mg weekly administration evaluate , show effective 3.6 % versus 22 % prevention versus prevention arm , respectively . Therefore , ciprofloxacin 750 mg/week reasonable option prevention SBP . However , comparison efficacy two method ( norfloxacin 400 mg daily versus ciprofloxacin 750 mg weekly ) perform , yet . The investigator aim compare efficacy safety norfloxacin 400 mg daily ciprofloxacin 750 mg weekly proper management cirrhotic patient ascites .</detailed_description>
