	<detailed_description>After initial clinical assessment , include spirometry review recent spirometric data , patient perform ISWT , describe . Those required use supplemental oxygen carry tank . For participated pilot study , another ISWT perform time . Following 1-hour rest period , baseline outcome assessment obtain . These include : 1 . The Endurance Shuttle Walk Test ( ESWT ) 9 After initial warm-up slow walk speed , patient walk external pace set audio source approximately 85 % maximal determine ISWT . Time speed record . 2 . Health status . This measure use self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ-SR ) domains dyspnea , fatigue , emotion mastery well total score . 3 . Dyspnea . This measure use 5-point Medical Research Council ( MRC ) rating . 4 . The number sit-to-stand repetition 30 second . The patient seat chair without arm instruct stand ( without use his/her arm ) return seat position many time possible 30-second period . This test first demonstrate investigator perform patient . 5 . The number arm lift repetition 60 seconds.11 The subject instruct stand repetitively raise wooden dowel , position rest thigh , eye level arm straight elbow , return original position . The maximum number complete repetition 60 record . Patients return 6 week non-intervention period above-listed outcome repeat . They give instruction use Wii Fit unit perform exercise home instruct perform least 30 minute specify exercise day week . The required exercise , sequence , 1 ) `` Basic Run '' ( warm exercise ) ; 2 ) `` Bird 's Eye , Bull's-Eye '' ( mostly upper arm exercise ) ; 3 ) `` Free Step '' ( mostly low extremity exercise ) ; 4 ) `` Obstacle Course '' ( upper low extremity exercise ) ; 5 ) `` Basic Run '' ( cool exercise ) . Additional , ad-lib exercise use device allow . They instruct maintain diary , record date session total number minute devote exercise . Other exercise base system allow record .</detailed_description>
