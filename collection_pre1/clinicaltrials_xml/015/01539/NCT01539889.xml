	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) result various clinical condition . It may idiopathic associate various cardiovascular lung disorder . Currently test non-invasively detect abnormality pulmonary circulation . There grow need non-invasive method detect PH . There currently exist ne agent approve Canada clinical imaging pulmonary circulation , 99mTc-labeled macroaggregates . This agent exclusively use diagnosis physical defect circulation due pulmonary embolus . This agent large small pulmonary vessel , limit sensitivity detect small vascular defect , well potential infectious risk since albumin macroaggregates derive human albumin . There need new lung tracer could provide great safety profile enable functional well anatomical image pulmonary circulation . DFH-12 ( PulmoBind ) peptide derive human adrenomedullin ( hAMI-52 ) . Hence development novel AM derivative , PulmoBind , molecular image pulmonary circulation . PulmoBind label 99mTc , commonly use image isotope nuclear medicine .</brief_summary>
