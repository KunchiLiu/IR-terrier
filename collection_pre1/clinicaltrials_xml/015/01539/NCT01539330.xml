	<brief_summary>The present study aim measure unbound voriconazole concentration plasma relevant target site systemic fungal infection , i.e . interstitial space fluid soft tissue , ass target site pharmacokinetics . For purpose microdialysis technique employ capable measuring unbound , microbiologically active concentration antifungal interstitial space fluid virtually tissue . This first human study drug employ microdialysis technique determine target site concentration several day ( single multiple dose ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Voriconazole , derivative fluconazole , one new triazole antifungal agent launched 2002 . It demonstrate favourable activity primary opportunistic fungal pathogen ( Aspergillus spp. , Candida spp . Cryptococcus spp . ) , common dermatophytes fungi cause endemic mycoses . Voriconazole approve primary treatment acute invasive aspergillosis , candidiasis salvage therapy rare serious fungal infection . Antifungals voriconazole display pharmacodynamic activity tissue , precisely interstitial space fluid ( ISF ) tissue , site fungal pathogen consider reside . Microdialysis novel approach determination drug concentration virtually tissue use vivo animal experiment since 1980s 10 year human study . The advantage technique easy handle reduces burden patient minimum tissue extraction necessary . Microdialysis allow continuous determination tissue drug concentration define time interval . In addition technique enable determine unbound , i.e . pharmacodynamically active fraction extracellular drug concentration site action . Most pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data voriconazole obtain single dose plasma ( bound unbound concentration ) . Regarding pharmacodynamic activity appropriate determine unbound concentration target site . The novel microdialysis technique allow evaluate concentration voriconazole subcutaneous interstitial fluid tissue ( unbound concentration ) , compartment pathogen consider reside . Apart multiple i.v . administration voriconazole , sequence therapy introduce , i.e . switch direct administration systemic circu¬lation absorption base administration process , introduce variability PK . A important reason assess voriconazole concentration sequence therapy i.v . dose normalised body weight oral dose give independently demographic dimension . The study aim determine unbound voriconazole concentration plasma relevant target site systemic fungal infection , i.e . interstitial space fluid soft tissue . Additionally , PK voriconazole single multiple i.v . p.o . dose characterise influence parameter PK evaluate . The design prospective , two part , open-labelled , uncontrolled , study . For exploratory study blind procedure perform . Due nature study , placebo comparator arm . The pharmacokinetics compare - 2 dose schedule : single multiple dose - 2 sampled matrix : plasma microdialysate</detailed_description>
