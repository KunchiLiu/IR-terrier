	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give rituximab together combination chemotherapy work treat patient previously untreated high- high-intermediate-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone ( CHOP ) , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug , combination chemotherapy , may kill cancer cell . Giving rituximab together combination chemotherapy together may effective treatment DLBCL</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated High- High-Intermediate-Risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 1 year progression-free survival ( PFS ) follow treatment rituximab intense dose CHOP-21 ( RID-CHOP ) previously untreated patient high risk ( International Prognostic Index [ IPI ] 3-5 ) DLBCL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate , previously untreated patient high risk ( IPI 3-5 ) DLBCL treat rituximab intense dose CHOP-21 : Complete response ( CR ) rate , ( define International Harmonization Project criterion use 18-fluorodeoxyglucose [ FDG ] -positron emission tomography [ PET ] /computed tomography [ CT ] ) . II . Overall survival . III . Toxicity profile . IV . Rituximab pharmacokinetics dose schedule . V. Effect immunophenotype DLBCL outcome . VI . Effect Fc-Gamma Receptor III ( FcyRIII ) polymorphism genotype outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 , 15 course 1 ; day 1 , 8 , 15 course 2 ; day 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive CHOP chemotherapy comprise cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
