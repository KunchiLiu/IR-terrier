	<brief_summary>Surgical patient endotracheal tube insert windpipe help breathe general anesthesia . These tube `` cuff '' outside inflated trachea help prevent fluid leak lung . These cuff come different shape size . The TaperGuard endotracheal tube taper-shaped cuff show animal decrease leakage fluid past cuff well traditional tube barrel-shaped cuff . This study design examine whether use TaperGuard tube surgery human decrease amount leakage past cuff great degree traditional barrel-shaped cuff . In addition , study investigate whether use TaperGuard tube associate decrease respiratory complication often see follow surgery may relate fluid leak past cuff lung . It think use TaperGuard endotracheal tube result decrease fluid leakage past cuff associate decrease respiratory complication 30 day surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design yield data intraoperative use TaperGuardâ„¢endotracheal tube potential influence postoperative pulmonary complication outcomes . The TaperGuard Basic tube taper-shaped cuff show , via bench animal testing , decrease microaspiration , associated respiratory difficulty . The intraoperative use tube ( i.e . short term intubation ) , impact postoperative complication outcomes investigate . This study determine whether intraoperative use TaperGuard tube result decrease microaspiration compare Hi-Lo endotracheal tube barrel-shaped cuff . Moreover , relationship decrease microaspiration subsequent decrease postoperative respiratory complication explore .</detailed_description>
