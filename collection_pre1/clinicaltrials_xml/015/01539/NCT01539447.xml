	<brief_title>Influence Naproxen Heterotropic Bone Formation Following Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heterotopic bone formation ( HO ) potentially serious complication hip surgery . HO , define formation normal bone abnormal soft tissue location , result alteration normal regulation skeletogenesis . Although patient remain asymptomatic despite HO development , two article include 10,826 patient 37 study suggest HO may associate substantial compromise function range motion even low grades.In large pool incidence study , HO estimate 43 % 59,121 patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty , 51 % 998 patient acetabular trauma . Few study report incidence HO follow hip arthroscopy . However , HO increasingly report complication arthroscopic treatment femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) . In comparison complication follow arthroscopic treatment FAI 8 case-series , ectopic ossification occur 6 % case account 10 19 report complication . Additionally , one recent study report HO incidence 33 % ( 5 15 patient ) follow hip arthroscopy patient prophylaxed NSAID therapy . In experience , HO occur comparable high rate 10 % undergoing procedure . The formation ectopic ossification trigger result muscle damage introduction hip portal potentially augment seed bone shaving soft tissue create bur femoral neck . Prophylaxis HO target biochemical mechanism heterotopic bone formation : 1 ) Disrupting inductive signaling pathway , 2 ) Altering osteoprogenitor cell target tissue , 3 ) Modifying environment conductive formation heteroptic bone . The two mainstay therapy low dose radiation treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication ( NSAIDs ) . The efficacy treatment find equivalent Burd et al 166 randomized patient . However , NSAID therapy show considerably cost effective low rate morbidity . Large randomize study subsequently show large reduction incidence HO use NSAID therapy perioperative period . The Cochrane review 16 randomize trial 5000 patient find one-half two-thirds reduction HO indomethacin.Even less potent NSAID therapy effective reduce rate HO . Fransen et al report 30 % reduction HO HIPAID trial compare perioperative ibuprofen placebo nearly 1000 patient . The two group statistical difference functional outcome despite high incidence HO prophylaxed group . While NSAID therapy effective reduce incidence HO , associate potentially serious side affect . Fransen et al find 202 GI side effect metaanalysis 4328 patient take NSAIDs HO prophylaxis.1 Of , 138 minor ( e.g . nausea , dyspepsia , diarrhea ) 64 major ( e.g . hematemesis melena ) . Overall , 31 % increase risk GI side effect among patient take NSAIDs . Furthermore , NSAID therapy could impair bone and/or soft tissue heal follow . These side affect could negate benefit NSAID therapy , especially HO asymptomatic majority patient . We hypothesize NSAID prophylaxis HO may role hip arthroscopy treatment femoroacetabular impingement . All NSAIDs test , exception aspirin , result significant decrease incidence HO follow hip surgery include less potent regimen ibuprofen 1200 mg/day . Naproxen offer advantage twice daily dose similar potency ibuprofen . It readily available inexpensive . Furthermore , unpublished series 50 patient prescribe naproxen follow hip arthroscopy FAI , case HO 6 month follow compare 5-10 % rate patient receive prophylaxis . We propose test hypothesis perioperative naproxen reduce incidence HO follow hip arthroscopy placebo control , double-blinded , randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
