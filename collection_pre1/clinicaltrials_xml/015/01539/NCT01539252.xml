	<brief_title>Examining Impact Using Two Dialysers Parallel Dialysis Adequacy Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Higher level serum phosphate independently associate increase risk death hemodialysis patient . Therefore , considerable interest control serum phosphate minimize oral calcium load . While attention focus use non-calcium contain phosphate binder sevelamer lanthanum , modify conventional dialysis regimen improve phosphate clearance alternative approach remain relatively unstudied . A secondary analysis previous randomize cross-over study group find use two dialysers parallel result reduction pre-dialysis serum phosphate level . As study small , mechanisms result reduction phosphate level unclear , study warrant . The investigator conduct randomize cross-over study compare impact dialyze use two dialysers parallel single dialyser hyperphosphatemic hemodialysis patient . There total 34 participant Alberta , Canada participate study . The length study participation 10 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Patients must stable regimen hemodialysis ≥ 3 month ( 'stable ' define expected require change duration frequency treatment ) Serum phosphate &gt; 1.6 mmol/l last two consecutive lab test least 3 week apart ( KDOQI guideline recommend maintain predialysis phosphate &lt; 1.8mmol/l , phosphate lower subgroup patient particularly relevant ) Patients must stable dos phosphate binder change dose 1 month prior study enrolment . Blood flow rate ≥ 350 ml/min wellfunctioning access ( This exclude patient receive inadequate dialysis due temporary venous dialysis catheter ensure sufficient blood flow permit dialysis use two dialysers parallel . ) Patients schedule renal transplant , change dialysis modality , surgery hospitalization plan move away study site next three month . Patients project life expectancy le 3 month . Patients contraindication intradialytic anticoagulation . ( Some patient require small increase amount anticoagulation require prevent dialyser clot use two dialysers parallel ) . Patients miss &gt; 8 dialysis treatment past 3 month . Patients dialysis regimen &gt; 3 run per week . Failure provide inform consent . Patients enrol another ( interventional ) trial</criteria>
