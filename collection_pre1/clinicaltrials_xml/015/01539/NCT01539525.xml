	<brief_summary>The investigator propose use obstetric-gynecological clinic conduct randomize clinical trial would compare two SBIRTS ( Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ) , deliver either train nurse computer , usual care ( control condition ) . As part trial , investigator include outcome allow u assess cost effectiveness three condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Augment Referral Treatment- Project START</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To assess whether SBIRT , base upon motivational interviewing deliver either computer train nurse , lead decrease use subject 's primary drug abuse . Hypothesis # 1a : Referrals base upon motivational principle deliver computer , compare usual care ( health brochure treatment resource ) , lead great reduction woman 's primary substance abuse . Hypothesis # 1b : Referrals base upon motivational principle deliver nurse , compare usual care ( health brochure treatment resource ) , lead great reduction woman 's primary substance abuse . Aim 2 : To determine whether SBIRT base upon motivational interviewing deliver either computer nurse promote substance abuse treatment utilization primary drug abuse . Hypothesis # 2a : Treatment utilization ( eg . treatment initiation , attendance , use quit-line medication ) high woman receive computer deliver brief intervention receive usual care . Hypothesis # 2b : Treatment utilization ( eg . treatment initiation , attendance , use quit-line medication ) high woman receive nurse deliver brief intervention receive usual care . Secondary Aim 3 : To evaluate whether SBI lead decrease HIV/AIDS risk Hypothesis # 3 : Rates sexually transmitted disease , injection drug use risky sexual behavior lower follow subject receive either computer nurse deliver brief intervention usual care subject . Secondary Aim 4 : To compare relative cost-effectiveness three intervention . Hypothesis # 4a : Screening usual care cost-effective intervention method value additional unit effect give individual 's outcome relatively low . Hypotheses # 4b : Screening , brief intervention deliver computer , cost-effective treatment method value additional unit effect relatively high . Hypotheses # 4c : Screening , brief intervention deliver nurse , less cost-effective brief intervention deliver computer .</detailed_description>

Are currently participate participate drug abuse treatment , include selfhelp intervention ( eg . 12 step facilitation , smoke cessation intervention ) , within last 3 month prior screen . 6 . Are plan relocate area follow 6 month . Women relocate area would difficult see follow assessment would difficult confirm treatment attendance local treatment center . 7 . Have previously participate protocol 8 . Are unwilling participate accept randomization .</criteria>
