	<brief_title>Clinical Study Silk Sericin Wound Dressing Split-thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Split-thickness skin graft ( STSG ) surgical procedure repair loss skin transfer section healthy skin ( donor site ) replace damage tissue another area body ( recipient site ) . However , patient new wound donor site need appropriate wound dress increase heal reduce complication . Since silk sericin form dress accelerate wound heal process protect wound environment , aim study investigate well silk sericin wound dress cure STSG donor sit compare Bactigras® commonly use paraffin-impregnated fine mesh gauze . Silk sericin wound dress promise material shorten treatment course reduce pain patient donor site . This study design single-center , randomize , open parallel positive control study.18-60- year-old patient gender undergo STSG anterolateral thigh Division plastic reconstructive surgery , King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital April 2012 January 2013 recruit study . The thickness donor sit fall 0.15-0.45 mm ( 0.006-0.018 inch ) size least 100 cm2 . The exclusion criterion donor site thigh locate high risk infection . Patients immunocompromised mental defect , unlikely comply protocol pregnant lactate know hypersensitivity investigational product also exclude . All subject sign inform consent overall discussion protocol , rationale potential risk . Donor sit equally divide 2 part ; upper low part leg . Using random number table allocation , silk sericin wound dress randomly apply one half half cover Bactigras® . Postoperatively , surgeon observe donor site daily treatment evaluation possible local adverse event without remove primary dressing , except excessive fluid leakage sign infection . Patients assess pain level every observation use Visual Analog Scale . Time complete epithelialisation duration finish surgical procedure dress spontaneously peel donor site without cause pain . If sign infection swell , edema , purulent discharge , bad odor , swab evaluation suspect area do find appropriate management . Blood sample collect patient pre- postoperatively ( 24h , day3 patient discharge ) CBC , blood glucose , electrolyte , hepatic renal function analysis proinflammatory cytokine measurement . This study may show possible adverse event , local systemic effect , cause silk sericin dress . Proinflammatory cytokine pattern patient underwent STSG reveal study may relate clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
