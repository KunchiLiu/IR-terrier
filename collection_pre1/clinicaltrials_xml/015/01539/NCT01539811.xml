	<brief_summary>This pilot study explore effect long-course versus short course antibiotic wound heal surgically manage diabetic foot infection . Hypothesis : Diabetic Foot Infections ( DFIs ) best manage early aggressive surgical approach short term antibiotic use . Post-operative prolonged antibiotic use increase cost resource utilization without improve outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetic Foot Infection Antibiotic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study optimize management diabetic foot infection . In cost conscious health care environment , believe equal outcome obtain cost effective efficient mean . In order conduct definitive study role antibiotic therapy regimens diabetic foot infection , first must collect pilot data determine feasibility appropriate method ( sample size , etc . ) design large trial . Currently , best way manage infection remain elusive ; many study suggest medical management sufficient surgical management reserve failure medical management aggressive foot infection ; however , approach lead recurrence delay definitive treatment significant increase cost . Several meta-analysis study try find best antibiotic regimen ; however , due vast discrepancy study design endpoint conclusive evidence exist best antibiotic regimen patient treat medically , let alone patient complicate disease require surgical management . The Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) guideline provide recommendation ; however , optimal length standardize date study look best regimen post-operative management surgically treat diabetic foot infection whether antibiotic help heal process . The IDSA guideline suggest antibiotic necessary virtually infected wound , specific guidance surgically treat wound lack . This randomized , single-blinded study ( Infectious disease physician determine long-term treatment blind ) . Randomization occur blocked random allocation scheme use randomization software block size 10 . The study coordinator keep randomization schedule/log inform surgeon therapy patient receive - Treatment group # 1 : Surgical intervention , short term course antibiotic ( &lt; 2 week post-op ) - Treatment group # 2 : Surgical intervention , long term course antibiotic ( &gt; 2 week post-op )</detailed_description>
