	<brief_title>Reveal Chagas : Clinical Evidence Implantable Cardiac Monitor Patients With Chagas Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study possible benefit superior treatment decision rate cardiac arrhythmia ( brady- or/ tachyarrhythmias ) use implantable cardiac monitor ( ICM ) patient Chagas Disease diagnose serology , asymptomatic and/or minimally symptomatic . Patients meet inclusion criterion study randomize standard care standard care plus ICM . Approximately half patient receive ICM . All patient follow 36 month . It expect enrollment phase last 1 year , total study duration 4 year . The study expect end 2017 . One hundred two patient need 95 % confidence level 80 % statistical power randomize study , approximately 5 center Latin America . Patients consider enrolled sign Informed Consent . The following additional parameter also collect : - Recorded arrhythmic event store within ICM ( bradyarrhythmia tachyarrhythmia ) - Time duration spend arrhythmia incidence symptomatic arrhythmia patient ICM . - Clinical data subject outcome change heart failure assess heart failure hospitalization , New York Heart Association class mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have Chagas disease , confirm two serological test . Provide evidence follow diagnosis method : Rest ECG , 24 hour Holter monitoring , electrophysiological study , stress test loop monitoring , least one electrical disorder consistent sinus bradycardia great 45 low 60 bpm , sinus arrest great 2.0 second , second degree atrial sinus block , intraventricular conduction disorder right branch , leave branch bifascicular blockage type , first degree AV blockage , type I second degree AV Block without associate bradycardia , atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmia NOT constitute indication pacemaker implant , ICD map radio frequency ablation . Be asymptomatic minimal isolate unspecific symptom consistent cardiac arrest , abort sudden death , syncope , frequent recurrent palpitation , cardiac failure , low extremity edema . Have ejection fraction leave ventricle &gt; 35 % Be able give his/her write informed consent . Subject &gt; 21 year old . Be able return followup visit require . Class I II ( accord AHA/HRS/ESC guideline ) indication final implantation pacemaker , ICD , cardiac resynchronizer . Exhibit extrinsic cause sinus dysfunction AV blockage . Exhibit infiltrative myocardial disease tumor associate valvular defect . Suffer concurrent disease may limit follow evaluation . Suffer aftereffects cerebral embolism . Suffer ablation isolation pulmonary vein previous inclusion study . Not able willing comply followup schedule . Have previous lesion spinal cord aftereffects skull trauma . Have record epilepsy . Receive pharmacological treatment disease may modify autonomic function . Have record myocardial infarction . History alcohol abuse drug addiction . History emotional instability , unstable psychiatric disorder treatment disorder . Have previously implant pacemaker , cardiodefibrillators CRT system . Are include intend participate another study device course study . Have clinical condition may limit life expectancy &lt; 36 month . Use Antiarrhythmic drug , except Beta Blockers</criteria>
