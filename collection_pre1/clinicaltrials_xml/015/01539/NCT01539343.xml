	<brief_summary>A CVC sterile flexible tube allow drug flow bottle bag directly patient 's bloodstream . CVCs may cause infection bacteria get catheter enters bloodstream . They also risk become clog . When occurs , CVC usually need replaced . The goal clinical research study learn antimicrobial catheter lock solution make possible CVC stay place treat infection antibiotic . The safety solution also test . Your outcome compare outcome patient type infection CVC remove . The antimicrobial catheter lock solution make 3 chemical : Minocycline ethanol design disinfect CVC . Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate design prevent CVC clogging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antimicrobial Catheter Lock Solution Treatment Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection ( CLABSI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration ( Lock Solution ) : If find eligible take part study , infection treat antibiotic accord standard care . You also receive antimicrobial catheter lock solution CVC 2 hour per day least 5 day within first week . In addition , receive lock therapy 2 additional day could either give follow next 2 day within next 2 week . After lock catheter 2 hour , HEAL lock clear , catheter flush normal saline lock heparin normal saline next time need use . Study Visits : On first day receive antimicrobial catheter lock solution , check side effect pain , burning , discomfort , drowsiness , headache , facial redness , shortness breath , and/or irregular heartbeat . After last dose receive catheter lock solution , ask experienced side effect receive catheter lock solution . One ( 1 ) time day hospital , check sign infection vital sign ( heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure , temperature ) measure . Every 2 day , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check infection . This continue blood draw longer show sign infection . Every week , blood ( one teaspoon ) drawn check liver function well . Length Study Participation : You may receive antimicrobial catheter lock solution 7 day ( course 3 week ) . You longer able receive intolerable side effect occur infection go away 7 day . End Treatment Visit : - You need return MD Anderson end treatment visit within 7 day ( +/- 3 day ) last dose study drug . - At visit , ask symptom illness may since last visit . You check sign infection vital sign measure . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check infection . You ask antimicrobial drug therapy may take end treatment . Follow-Up Visit : You follow-up visit 1 month receive last dose antimicrobial catheter lock solution . At visit , check sign infection vital sign measure . If doctor think need , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check infection . You ask antimicrobial drug may take end treatment . This investigational study . The study lock solution make minocycline , disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate , ethanol . Each commercially available FDA approve us : - Minocycline - treatment cellulitis , acne , respiratory urinary tract infection , gonococcal , chlamydial ureaplasma urealyticum infection , cutaneous nocardiosis , syphilis . - Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate - treatment lead poison - Ethanol - cleaning hand It investigational give minocycline , disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate , ethanol combination antimicrobial lock solution . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients age 18 year old 2 . Patients indwell CVC place least 14 day document CLABSI define CDC [ 62 ] . In neutropenic patient ( define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 500 cells/mm3 ) CLABSI , confirm CVC source bacteremia , use definition catheterrelated bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) base mgmt guideline intravascular catheter relate infection publish IDSA [ 10 ] . This include evidence point CVC culprit : ) Paired quantitative blood culture ( QBC ) , whereby QBC drawn CVC peripheral vein blood culture CVC reveal 3fold great number colony peripherally draw QBC . b ) Differential time positivity , blood culture simultaneously draw CVC peripheral vein positive organism , catheterdrawn blood culture turn positive least 2 hour earlier peripherally draw blood culture . 3 . Female patient must nonlactating risk pregnancy one follow reason : ) Postmenopausal least one year b ) Posthysterectomy and/or postbilateral ovariectomy and/or surgical sterilization c ) If childbearing potential , negative urine serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test within 5 day prior study enrollment use highly effective method birth control throughout course study . Reliable sexual abstinence throughout course study acceptable highly effective method birth control purpose study . 4 . Patients short term nontunneled catheter enrol CVC remove exchange ( patient refuse CVC remove , CVC need vascular access available , patient thrombocytopenic ( platelet count 20,000 ) prohibit insert new CVC different site ) . 1 . Patients allergic tetracycline antibiotic calcium EDTA 2 . Patients disulfiram disulfiram like drug 3 . Patients severe sepsis , septic shock , hypotension consider otherwise unstable 4 .
