Rehabilitation include physical training recommend result decreased morbidity mortality increase physical capacity quality life . Unfortunately improvement decrease patient maintain physical activity level . To change physical activity behaviour challenge . Different method Social Cognitive Theory , SCT Transtheoretical model , TTM suggest theoretical framework . According SCT , improve physical activity behaviour use goal-setting , outcome expectancy , self-efficacy , self-monitoring .
