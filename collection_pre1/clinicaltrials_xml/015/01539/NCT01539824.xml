	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety effect IMM 101 combination single target dose radiation patient metastatic colorectal cancer chemotherapy treatment effective . Administration radiation ( use CyberKnife ) target tumour growth liver result release tumour material . IMM-101 may help immune system react tumour material release damage tumour , beneficial effect slow rate growth tumour growth liver organ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study IMM-101 Combination With Radiation Induced Tumour Necrosis Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy give standard fractionation regime lead cell death cause double strand DNA break via production oxygen free radical . At high dos stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) administer extreme accuracy single fraction CyberKnife system , induction tumour necrosis due endothelial cell damage vascular collapse , cell membrane breakdown , release cellular material tumour antigens circulation , addition DNA strand break . It hypothesise combination modulation body 's immune response presence increase exposure tumour antigen provide sufficient induction immune system suppress tumour growth .</detailed_description>
