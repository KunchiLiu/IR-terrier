	<brief_title>Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) Ovarian Cancer Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among malignancy female genital tract , ovarian cancer second common cancer endometrial tumor , lethal , represent fifth lead cause death among woman industrialize country . For part , epithelial tumor ( &gt; 70 % ) , begin vague gastrointestinal symptom , general malaise , abdominal bloating , weight loss fatigue . Because non-specificity oh symptom often late presentation , 70 % diagnosis make advanced stage disease ( IIIC ) . In last two decade modest improvement survival achieve . Moreover , even optimal cytoreduction follow adjuvant chemotherapy base platinum taxane , currently standard type disease , patient stage III disease develop recurrence . Rational HIPEC recurrent ovarian cancer : cytoreduction . Contrary happen primary disease yet clear standard treatment recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) . Patients experience recurrence within 6 month end first-line chemotherapy consider platinum-resistant applied salvage treatment second line drug low response rate poor survival . Patients recur 6 month consider platinum-sensitive , therefore , subject new chemotherapy treatment platinum compound possibly combination paclitaxel ( re-challenge ) . In patient possible achieve clinical response rate similar primary treatment , median survival report 12 24 month . Recently surgery affirmed major role primary treatment also recurrent chemo-sensitive ovarian cancer . A meta-analysis 2019 patient show obtain optimal secondary cytoreduction independently correlate survival ( OS ) recurrence . However , recent Cochrane , show , study available nowadays , possible substantiate difference prognosis exclusive chemotherapy treatment association surgery adjuvant chemotherapy . The result multicenter trial DESKTOP I show , even presence peritoneal carcinomatosis , 2-year survival improve optimal cytoreduction obtain . Rational HIPEC recurrent ovarian cancer : intraperitoneal chemotherapy Many patient undergo optimal cytoreduction may benefit adjuvant chemotherapy administer intraperitoneally ( IP ) . Several randomized trial demonstrate improved survival associate IP platinum-based chemotherapy first-line adjuvant therapy optimal cytoreduction , although still unclear patient might benefit , would best drug , dose right number cycle . The adjuvant IP therapy , however , seem side effect intravenous therapy ( IV ) consequently worsen quality life ( QOL ) . Rational use HIPEC recurrent ovarian cancer : hyperthermia The association hyperthermia plus chemotherapy surgery base rational cytotoxic effect hyperthermia , cause rupture cell membrane due protein denaturation ( direct effect ) , also increase permeability new vessel impairment receptor protein complex ( indirect effect ) . The sensitivity solid tumor hyperthermia probably link creation microenvironment low pH , low oxygen tension , low glucose level response high temperature . Inactivation tumor cell time temperature dependent , start 40-41 ° C. Experimental data show human tumor cell line sensitive moderate hyperthermia ( 41-42 ° C ) . Furthermore , ability cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , include mitomycin C , doxorubicin , cisplatin oxaliplatin , enhance hyperthermia . Secondary cytoreduction ( CRS ) , HIPEC ovarian cancer Since first appearance 1980 , HIPEC associate surgery increasingly important role treatment several type cancer peritoneal dissemination . The rational therapeutic approach base achievement high drug concentration contact peritoneal surface lower systemic concentration , result decrease systemic toxicity treatment . The addition hyperthermia prove able cytotoxic effect tumor cell directly indirectly , synergistic effect several cytotoxic agent . Two recent trial include heterogeneous population patient EOC demonstrate use HIPEC association CRS follow overall survival ( OS ) three year recurrence vary 20-63 % . Data trial take place Institution recently publish use HIPEC platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patient , show median disease-free interval ( PFS ) OS 24 38 month respectively , estimate PFS OS 3 year 44 % 92 % respectively . These data confirm previously report literature , significant , probably highly select population , characteristic contrast wide heterogeneity trial make . In fact , demonstrate meta-analysis Bristow et al , median survival recurrence group patient treat CRS standard adjuvant chemotherapy alone 30.3 month . This difference survival compare trial could justify increased rate optimal cytoreduction obtain Institution ( 95.3 % vs. 52.2 % ) . In addition , basis criterion develop Markman , second-line treatment recurrence reach PFS similar comparable primary disease consider effective , data show additional benefit obtain HIPEC . In series patient underwent CRS + HIPEC Institution , fact , median PFS primary disease substantially equal recurrence value 25 24 month respectively ( p = n ) . Therefore treatment CRS associate HIPEC platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patient would seem offer opportunity term prognosis primary treatment . Regarding complication link procedure , trial complete Institution , show morbidity mortality rate 35 % 0 % , consistent data present recent review ( 12 - 52 % 0,9-5,8 % respectively ) , however heterogeneous due difference consider study . In addition , analysis divide two block per year execution procedure , demonstrate significant reduction percentage complication ( 26.7 % ) statistically significant difference . Currently , despite presence strong biological pharmacological rational 10 year application EOC , use HIPEC clinical practice continue receive mixed review . The limit confidence procedure lack randomize clinical trial heterogeneity different phase II study conduct , result lack scientific evidence level I-II . Moreover , find high rate related morbidity mortality , preclude use procedure many patient peritoneal disease . The primary objective trial therefore ass whether use CRS combination HIPEC able offer effectively advantage term survival compare exclusive optimal CRS , platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patient , potentially could undergo complete cytoreduction basis pre-and intraoperative evaluation .</detailed_description>
