	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether keep amount oxygen deliver brain certain level surgery 24-hours surgery improve recovery . Hypothesis 1 : keep amount oxygen deliver brain certain level surgery 24-hours surgery improve cognitive neurological outcome cardiac aortic surgery . Hypothesis 2 : keep amount oxygen deliver brain certain level surgery 24-hours surgery help reduce major organ problem cardiac aortic surgery . To test hypothesis , investigator conduct randomize control trial . Patients randomly assign one two possible study group . In Treatment Group , brain oxygen level watch doctor use guide care operate room first day intensive care unit surgery . Doctors try keep brain oxygen level normal range adjust blood pressure , carbon dioxide blood acidity level , blood count . In Control Group , doctor aware brain oxygen level unless fall level may dangerous . If patient 's brain oxygen fall level , doctor adjust blood pressure , carbon dioxide blood acidity level , blood count increase brain oxygen level . All procedure part regular medical care perform accord standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background There high incidence cognitive dysfunction , neurological dysfunction , multi-system organ dysfunction syndrome follow cardiac surgery . There preliminary evidence optimization cerebral oxygenation associate improved neurological clinical outcome . Cerebral oximetry use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) base ability near-infrared light penetrate scalp skull , differential intracranial absorbance oxyhemoglobin ( HbO2 ) deoxyhemoglobin ( Hb ) . Cerebral oximetry measure regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation ( SctO2 ) microvascular level ( arteriole , venule , capillary ) provide information availability oxygen brain tissue . Unlike digital pulse oximetry , SctO2 reflect regional cerebral metabolism regional balance cerebral oxygen supply demand . NIRS SctO2 promise monitor technology purpose guide intervention target improve brain organ preservation . The reason include : ( 1 ) SctO2 continuous , non-invasive , available point care ; ( 2 ) SctO2 sensitive index cerebral hypoxia and/or cerebral ischemia , main cause brain injury clinical setting . The preliminary work Murkin strongly suggest optimize tissue perfusion use protocol-based treatment optimize SctO2 decrease end-organ dysfunction cardiothoracic surgical patient . Recruitment Methods Potential subject patient plan undergo elective cardiac surgery Mount Sinai Hospital . Potential subject identify check pre-admission schedule f cardiothoracic surgery daily basis . Patients recruit surgical pre-admission screening ; write informed consent obtain . Risks Subjects Cerebral oximetry computerize neurocognitive testing pose know risk harm subject . Cerebral oximetry evolve technology currently imminently become standard care monitor cardiothoracic surgical patient . The expense lack outcome data make discretionary monitoring technology advocate , incorporate evidence-based guideline practice parameter . Therefore , compare exist standard care , patient expose additional risk withhold cerebral oximetry information practitioner . Interventions maintain cerebral oximetry threshold value could potentially injurious ( e.g. , initiate red blood cell transfusion would otherwise give ) , however , potential risk impart intervention maintain cerebral oximetry value justify benefit avert low low period cerebral oximetry within context research protocol .</detailed_description>
