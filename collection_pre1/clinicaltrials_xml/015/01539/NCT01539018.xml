	<brief_summary>- Unlike Asian western region , The vast majority Egyptian/Arabic Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) associate . - According SHARP study subgroup analysis , seem HCV associate HCC patient derive max benefit Sorafenib , absolute gain Sorafenib arm &amp; placebo OS = 7 month , HR=0.58 ( 95 % CI : 0.37-0.91 ) . - In spite improvement term overall survival ( OS ) time progression ( TTP ) , study Sorafenib compare placebo , Sorafenib arm accompany significant volumetric reduction , may explain lack symptomatic improvement ( time symptomatic progression ( TTSP ) almost identical ) - Reviewing chemotherapy outcome , although convincing evidence survival benefit patient advance HCC , however true shrinkage ( reduction tumor size ) , consistently report although magnitude response lack consistency . This indicate need couple Sorafenib chemotherapeutic agent : - For patient Hepatocellular Carcinoma , toxicity profile chemotherapeutic agent choice add Sorafenib take consideration - The agent add Sorafenib effective term Tumor Shrinkage &amp; minimal toxicity regarding : - Cardio-toxicity - HFSR - Diarrhea - Hepato-toxicity - Bone marrow suppression ( although relevant toxicity profile Sorafenib , yet HCC patient may HCV relate thrombocytopenia variable degree hypersplenism relate pancytopenia ) Circulatory Overload ( Hypertension ) Why Tegafur-uracil ( UFT ) ? - Efficacy : For UFT , although efficacy data HCC extensive Doxorubicin , however one phase II study UFT could improve survival compare conservative management . - UFT Toxicity Profile : In phase III trial ass compare Efficacy &amp; Safety UFT 5 FU treatment CRC , Hematological toxicity minimal ( 0 % Grade ¾ leukopenia , neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , thrombocytopenia &amp; 3 % anemia ) , commonly see SE grade I &amp; II Diarrhea •Accordingly UFT may consider potential partner Sorafenib patient advance HCC .</brief_summary>
