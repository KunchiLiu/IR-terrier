	<brief_title>A Pilot Clinical Trial With Iron Chelator Deferiprone Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 BACKGROUND Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder affect approximately 2 % population age 60 year . The common clinical motor control feature tremor , bradykinesia , postural abnormality rigidity . However , many patient non-motor feature cognitive decline , depression , autonomic disturbance also occur disease progress . The principal pathology degeneration nigrostriatal dopaminergic system play major role movement control release dopamine striatum . Current therapeutic approach focus dopamine replacement strategy either dopamine precursor L-DOPA use dopamine agonist , and/or use monoamine oxidase inhibitor catecholamine transferase inhibitor prevent breakdown dopamine facilitate L-DOPA entry brain . However , therapeutic approach associate decline efficacy long term complication e.g . dyskinesia . Additionally , therapeutic approach treat clinical symptom PD due protect neuron degeneration hence disease continue progress patient experience increase disability . Hence chronic need development neuroprotective drug prevent neuronal loss thus prevent progression disease . 1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY Hypothesis : Increased iron oxidative stress play major role neurodegenerative process PD iron chelation therapy effective remove excess iron brain potentially slow neurodegenerative process . Research question : Can iron chelation therapy Deferiprone remove excess iron substantia nigra PD patient without toxic side effect . What effect Deferiprone therapy severity PD brain function e.g . cognition , depression etc . Increased iron level heavily implicate neurodegenerative process PD . Although many cellular process require iron , excessive amount trigger formation toxic chemical call free radical , extensive evidence increase formation PD brain . Hence removal excess iron iron chelation ( drug bind detoxify iron ) represent potential drug target . Iron chelators e.g . Deferiprone dose around 100mg/kg/day , extensively utilised treat peripheral iron overload disorder beta thalassaemia , patient require regular blood transfusion iron accumulates body red blood cell remove circulation . Iron chelation therapy patient associate minimal side effect long term use . Recently , animal model brain iron overload , demonstrate iron chelators enter brain removing excess iron . Additionally , recently show iron chelation therapy protect neuron toxin animal model PD . In 2007 20 30mg/kg/day Deferiprone use pilot clinical trial Friedreich ataxia ( FA ) patient , ass whether drug well tolerate , remove excess brain iron improve clinical symptom FA . FA occur due gene defect lead iron accumulation mitochondrion cerebellum , toxicity lead ataxia inability control muscle movement . FA diagnose young individual ( 14-26 year age ) clinical treatment . In 6 month FA study Deferiprone 20 30mg/kg/day well tolerated patient result reduction brain iron , indicate MRI brain imaging , lead clinical improvement patient symptom . Whilst represent first clinical use iron chelator treat neurodegenerative disorder , FA patient study young ( 14-23 year old ) hence know age ( average age 60years ) individual commonly affect PD respond iron chelator treatment . Hence first aim study conduct first pilot clinical trial iron chelator newly diagnose PD patient assess tolerability along ability reduce iron content brain area affect PD , substantia nigra , assess MRI . A number clinical trial already conduct PD potential neuroprotective drug ability slow disease process controversial since drug direct effect symptoms PD . Hence difficult say whether beneficial effect drug due prevention neuronal loss thus slow disease whether improve patient 's ability move directly . PD progress patient fairly slowly , hence n't expect see detectable neuroprotection follow 6 month Deferiprone treatment allow u ass whether Deferiprone therapy direct effect PD symptom . Hence second aim study examine whether iron chelation therapy direct effect PD symptomology . If pilot study clearly demonstrate good tolerability Deferiprone PD patient whilst show good removal excess SN iron level yet minimal direct effect PD symptomology data form basis large funding application multicentre clinical trial investigate whether long term Deferiprone treatment slow/halt progression PD .</detailed_description>
