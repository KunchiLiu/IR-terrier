	<detailed_description>1 . Objective : To determine extent reason relapse re-infection incident case tuberculosis ( TB ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -infected patient Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) 2 . Design : A prospective cohort study patient HIV previously treat pulmonary TB initiate HAART SAPIT ( Starting AIDS treatment three Points TB treatment ) START ( Starting Tuberculosis Anti-Retroviral Therapy ) trial . Each incident case TB recurrence cohort adult patient HAART investigate ass whether infect mycobacterium similar previous infection whether immune response differ case relapse re-infection . 3 . Population : Men woman 18 year age document HIV infection past TB therapy part SAPIT START trial enrol . 4 . Study Procedures : This study involve 3 year follow-up patient initiated course TB therapy part SAPIT START trial . Upon exit SAPIT trial ( i.e . 18 month post-TB diagnosis ) , study patient consent enrolled cohort study . Study participant see monthly first 3 month thereafter 3 monthly , routine clinic visit ART service . At every visit patient screen TB recurrence clinically , chest radiograph , whenever possible , available TB diagnostics new diagnostics develop and/or test . 5 . Study Outcome The primary endpoint study development recurrent TB . TB recurrence result relapse define isolates M. tuberculosis first second episode TB cluster Restriction Fragment Length Polymerization ( RFLP ) analysis . TB recurrence result re-infection define isolates first second episode TB differ RFLP analysis . Each study participant recurrent TB assess Interferon ( IFN ) gamma ELISPOT assay compare cytotoxic lymphocyte ( CTL ) immune response TB relapse re-infection .</detailed_description>
