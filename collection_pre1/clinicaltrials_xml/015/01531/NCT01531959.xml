	<brief_title>Midodrine Treatment Refractory Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent hypotension critically ill patient remain major barrier discharge patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) . In hospital , patient adequate tissue perfusion , midodrine observe treat hypotension order wean continuous intravenous ( IV ) vasopressor therefore promote ICU discharge . There several possible etiology hypotension ICU . The frequently see cause include septic shock , hypovolemia , adrenal insufficiency , idiosyncratic reaction medication . For patient whose reversible cause hypotension address still require vasopressor , midodrine may prove useful adjunctive medication successfully increase blood pressure . No previous study examine use midodrine treatment hypotension ICU setting . Therefore , investigate new indication midodrine treatment hypotension critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
