	<brief_title>Evaluation Of Mobile Gamma Camera Imaging For Sentinel Node Biopsy In Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schedule undergo sentinel node biopsy part recommend clinical care offer participation study . Patients enrol study receive standard lymphoscintigraphy nuclear medicine ; however , image review investigator preoperative mobile gamma camera ( MGC ) image obtain . Upon completion preoperative MGC imaging , investigator define location SLNs plan surgical approach . The investigator review FGC image assess agreement two imaging methodology . The hand-held gamma probe use evaluate patient time final determination true hot spot make base information clinical judgment operate surgeon . The final surgical plan decide . The primary data obtain cohort confirmation use MGC image screen device identify nodal basins contain SLNs . An additional goal study identify technique may improve use MGC opportunity optimize MGC device image system . To extent possible , improvement system make incrementally . A goal optimized system next trial . In addition preoperative imaging data discuss , participant reevaluate intraoperatively MGC hand-held probe follow time point : 1. removal sentinel node 2. completion sentinel node biopsy procedure In assessment , follow record : number location sentinel node , correspondence preoperative hot spot determine clinical gamma detection device ( fix camera , MGC hand-held probe ) , time require imaging , technical feature use , advantage , limitation MGC imaging system . The individual sentinel node image ex vivo count hand-held probe .</detailed_description>
