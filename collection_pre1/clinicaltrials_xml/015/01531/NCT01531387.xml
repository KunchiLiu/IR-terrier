	<brief_summary>The primary goal Phase III SCATE trial compare 30 month alternative therapy ( hydroxyurea ) standard care ( observation ) child sickle cell anemia conditional ( 170 - 199cm/sec ) Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) velocity . For alternative regimen ( hydroxyurea ) declare superior standard treatment regimen ( observation ) , hydroxyurea-treated group must three-fold reduction incidence conversion abnormal TCD velocity ( ≥ 200 cm/sec ) , compare standard treatment arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sparing Conversion Abnormal TCD ( Transcranial Doppler ) Elevation ( SCATE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results previous study confirm increase risk stroke among child conditional TCD velocity . In addition , study suggest patient observation alone , convert conditional TCD ( moderate risk category ) abnormal TCD ( much high risk primary stroke ) within 30 month initial identification conditional TCD velocity ; conversion lead initiation chronic indefinite transfusion case . Preliminary data suggest risk conversion abnormal TCD velocity low subject conditional TCD velocity hydroxyurea least three-fold . This important difference conversion risk rate suggest alternative treatment could substantial beneficial impact patient elevate TCD velocity . An alternative treatment could protect brain patient SCA conditional TCD velocity increase risk stroke . The avoidance chronic blood transfusion would great benefit child sickle cell disease , especially develop country blood supply may less safe ( comparison US ) unavailable , costly .</detailed_description>
