	<brief_title>To Assess Rotation Femoral Version Tibial Torsion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study 1 ) ass inter/intra-observer reliability rotational measurement axial MRI image 2 ) determine correlation clinical MRI measure femoral version tibial torsion . The investigator use previously obtain MRI image retrospectively calculate inter-observer intra-observer reliability measurement . Participating physician undergo train standardize measurement technique . Five orthopaedic surgeon one radiologist perform measurement calculate inter-observer reliability . To asses intra-observer reliability , repeat measurement perform physician later date ( least 2 week ) . The physician blind previous result perform second set measurement . A standardized rotational profile perform patient present investigator patellofemoral complaint rotational abnormality warrant intervention . Internal external hip rotation measure prone supine position . Tibial torsion assess thigh-foot axis prone sit position . Investigators participate formal training session prior data collection normalize measurement . Each study participant undergo MRI image femur tibia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Retrospective : Prior study MRI image available University PACS system Prior study MRI image obtain PCMC upload OsiriX software ( OsiriX software program compatible multiple image format easily adaptable measurement tool ) We search image database 2009 current . Included gun site MRI study obtain PCMC UOC evaluation rotational profile . We exclude study image sufficient obtain required measurement need study . A preliminary review image database identify 42 potential study . Our power analysis call 15 patient include obtain 95 % confidence interval . Prospective : All patient investigate physician , male female , age 8 30 presenting complaint patellofemoral pain/instability rotational abnormality All patient neuromuscular disease , include cerebral palsy Retrospective : Any patient image study insufficient provide required measurement patient previously surgically treated rotational malalignment Prospective : Any patient undergone previous surgical treatment rotational malalignment . Any patient implantable device compatible MRI</criteria>
