	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial . One hundred twenty cocaine-dependent men woman randomize one three treatment group : placebo ( n=40 ) , 8 mg/day ( n=40 ) , 16 mg/day ( n=40 ) extend release ( ER ) galantamine . An urn randomization use balance group gender , severity cocaine use ( measured day cocaine use ) , baseline cognitive functioning [ determine via Shipley Institute Living Scale ( SILS ) ] , smoke status . Gender severity cocaine use show predict treatment response cocaine user ( 76 ) . Similarly , balance treatment group baseline cognitive functioning , assess SILS score , minimize influence baseline difference cognitive outcome ( 77 , 78 ) . Smoking status also important baseline variable , give galantamine 's action nicotinic receptor potential efficacy smoke cessation ( 65 ) . The initial dose galantamine 8 mg/day single dose , recommend clinical use . For assigned 16 mg/day , dose galantamine increase 16 mg end week 4 . Treatment group remain full dosage week 13 . All participant receive contingency management ( CM ) target treatment compliance . In three previous cocaine pharmacotherapy trial use bupropion , desipramine levodopa , medication efficacy cocaine use evident medication combine CM , standard care ( 79-81 ) . These finding provide strong rationale use CM clinical trial . Recruitment continue . This protocol amend May 2014 come one dispense visit , two clinic visit . The payment change gift card cash . This change help increase number completers . Currently 40 completers 9 active 6 follow phase . The follow phase end June 2016 . Currently analysis .</detailed_description>
