	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multicentre phase II trial perform patient intermediate HER2-positive , metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) pretreated anthracyclines one first-line therapy metastatic setting . The main objective trial evaluate efficacy safety BIBW 2992 combination vinorelbine patient intermediate HER2-positive MBC . If trial show promise result , study evaluate benefit BIBW 2992 combination chemotherapy subgroup intermediate HER2-positive patient MBC warrant . Patients follow progression . After progression , purpose analyse overall survival , information vital status subsequent treatment collect . The primary objective determine 6-month progression free survival rate BIBW 2992 vinorelbine i.v . patient metastatic , HER2 IHC 2+ , HER2 FISH-negative breast cancer . BIBW 2992 combination vinorelbine provide suitable combination test hypothesis patient metastatic breast cancer whose tumour HER2 2+ immunohistochemistry , negative fluorescence in-situ hybridisation ( FISH ) benefit combination cytotoxic agent , i.e . vinorelbine , plus dual irreversible EGFR/HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992 .</brief_summary>
