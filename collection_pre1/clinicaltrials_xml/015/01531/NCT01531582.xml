Unlike antibiotic family , MC possess unique characteristic able cross blood brain barrier . The study dosage use trial treatment neurologic disorder positive outcome . Studies long-term administration MC study dose show safe well tolerate . This dosage already approve FDA use treatment bacterial infection multiple organ system , acne vulgaris . It important note minocycline approve treat Angelman syndrome use child young 8 year old . The study protocol review several physician scientist deem safe proceed . As medication potential side effect exist . The side effect range serious mild include allergic reaction upset stomach . In order minimize risk , medical staff perform thorough medical history physical examination prescription issue ensure allergy medication , penicillin another tetracycline exist . Discoloration teeth potential adverse effect exist take high dos MC long period time . The tooth discoloration permanent parent guardian participant make aware potential side effect prior enrollment study . In study use MC , common complaint gastrointestinal upset . Recruitment &amp; Prescreening - We anticipate study participant live far study site . In order reduce screen failure ( travel site find child n't meet study criterion ) follow process require . To give parent opportunity consider study time consult doctor ( ) , begin recruitment approximately one week study publish website . Parents ask submit information electronically click link bottom webpage access weeberlab.com/clinical_trials.html . In event internet access , may call study coordinator assistance . Once indicated interest participation , packet information send via email ( postal service prefer ) . The packet include inform consent document , release medical information form primary care doctor complete return directly u . All information review medical staff determine child 's eligibility . Out first 50 eligible participant , 24 randomly select Clinical Investigational Science Institute ( CTSI ) USF . Study Procedure - Those select require travel study site total 3 time 2 day expense ( assistance may available Foundation Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics , visit www.cureangelman.org ) . It important seriously consider ability complete study . The number participant allow enroll strictly govern funding limit . It imperative data collect 24 participant ensure best possible result . We know child benefit receive medication , study . During visit child ask provide blood sample undergo electroencephalogram gram ( EEG ) , physical examination well behavioral assessment . During first visit , study drug , minocycline , dispense . You ask administer study drug child twice daily . You also ask log administration confirm compliance study regimen . A telephone interview conduct 4 week treatment assess drug tolerance record change may observe . The study medication discontinue 8 week treatment . At time point , return study site follow visit identical primary visit . The final follow visit occur 16 week time point ( 8 week follow minocycline treatment ) . This visit identical first two visit ass lasting effect medication . Below summary study procedure . Summary Study Procedures : 1 . Recruitment Begins - Interested parent contact study staff via internet form . 2 . Prescreening packet send - Informed Consent Document , Health Information Release &amp; Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) questionnaire 3 . Eligibility Determined 30 potential participant 4 .
