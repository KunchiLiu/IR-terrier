	<brief_title>MULTIcentric BElgium/NEtherlands PRO-Kinetic Safety Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PRO-Kinetic study multi-center , prospective , consecutive non-randomized study enrol 200 patient single de novo lesion native coronary artery meet entry criterion . Those provide informed consent enrol receive PRO-Kinetic stent . Telephone follow-up perform 1 month enrol patient . After 6 month 100 patient angiographic follow-up 100 patient check telephone . Additionally , clinical telephone follow-up perform patient 12 month . This study design yield data clinical safety efficacy PRO-Kinetic stent coronary artery application . The Target Vessel Failure Rate 6 month shall 18 % ( max . 35 Serious Adverse Events Expedited Events ) show safety/performance profile could consider range currently available bare metal stent system</detailed_description>
