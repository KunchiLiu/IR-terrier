	<brief_title>Lenalidomide/Bortezomib/Dexamethasone &amp; CNTO 328 Transplant Eligible Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Siltuximab design block IL-6 , protein play important role survival myeloma cancer cell . This may slow growth cancer cell cause cancer cell die . Bortezomib design block protein play role cell function growth . This may cause cancer cell die . Lenalidomide design kill myeloma cell may change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may slow growth cancer cell . Dexamethasone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Dexamethasone often give MM patient combination chemotherapy treat cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , base join study enrol Phase I Phase II portion . If Phase I , assign dose level Siltuximab base join study . Up 2 dose level Siltuximab test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive high dose level . If intolerable side effect see first group , next group receive low dose . All participant receive dose level bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . After high tolerable dose level find , extra 54 participant receive study drug dose level Phase II part study . Study Drug Administration : Induction Therapy - Each cycle 21 day . On Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 Cycle 1 Cycle 8 ( induction therapy ) , receive bortezomib needle skin vein 3-5 second . On Days 1-14 every cycle , take lenalidomide mouth 1 time day . Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Do break , chew , open capsule . On Day 1 every cycle , receive Siltuximab vein 1 hour . On Days 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 Cycles 1-8 ( induction therapy ) , take dexamethasone mouth 1 time day . After 8 cycle , may continue take dexamethasone doctor think need . Dexamethasone take food . You take study drug time day take time every day . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . You give study drug dose calendar cycle record lenalidomide dexamethasone take home . Please bring dose calendar pill bottle study visit begin new cycle . If doctor think best interest , may stem cell transplant anytime 4 cycle induction therapy You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . Maintenance Phase - Each cycle 28 day . If want delay stem cell transplant , 4-8 cycle , begin maintenance phase . During maintenance phase : - You take lenalidomide Days 1-21 cycle . - You take dexamethasone mouth week . - You receive Siltuximab vein Day 1 every cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight vital sign . - Your medical history update . - You ask list drug may take side effect . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - You complete 2 questionnaire day-to-day activity quality life . They take 5 minute complete . - If able become pregnant , blood urine ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure protein level , may help researcher learn good treat myeloma . On Day 1 Cycles 2-8 : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask list drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect check status disease . If urine collect , collect urine 24 hour . You provide container collect urine . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure protein level , may help researcher learn good treat myeloma . - You complete questionnaire day-to-day activity - If able become pregnant , blood urine ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . On Days 4 Cycles 1-8 : -Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 8 Cycle 1 : -You bone marrow aspirate good understand drug affect myeloma . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . On Days 8 Cycles 1-8 : -Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . During Cycle 1 , routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . On Day 11 Cycles 1-8 : -Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At end induction therapy ( go stem cell transplant , end Cycle 4 ) : - You physical exam . - You ask list drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You skeletal survey check status disease . - If disease completely respond study drug , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status response . On Day 1 Cycles 9 beyond ( Maintenance Therapy ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask list drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect check status disease . If urine collect , collect urine 24 hour . You provide container collect urine . - If doctor think need , skeletal survey check status disease . - If doctor think need , MRI scan CT scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure protein level , may help researcher learn good treat myeloma . - You complete questionnaire day-to-day activity quality life . Pregnancy Tests : During induction therapy , woman able become pregnant regular period , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test weekly first 21 day every 21 day therapy ( include break therapy ) . If woman able become pregnant cycle irregular , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test weekly first 21 day every 11-14 day therapy ( include break therapy ) . During maintenance therapy , woman able become pregnant regular menstruation , must pregnancy test every 28 day therapy ( include break therapy ) . If woman able become pregnant cycle irregular , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test every 14 day ( +/-1 day ) every 28 day . Length Study : You may stay study long disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 1 month last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your performance status record . - You ask list drug may take side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement height weight . - You skeletal survey . - You bone marrow biopsy check status disease . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Long-Term Follow-Up : If go study reason disease get bad , blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This do every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month Years 3 4 , yearly Years 5 6 . The long term visit check disease status , survival , long term side effect , secondary cancer . This investigational study . Siltuximab FDA approve commercially available . It use research time . Bortezomib FDA approve commercially available front-line treatment MM . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type myelodysplastic syndrome use dexamethasone patient MM receive least 1 therapy . The use drug combination treat MM investigational . Up 11 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
