	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether combination new urine test blood test show kidney injury early stage , kidney failure set . If investigator find new test show kidney injury early stage , investigator hope start treat people kidney injury earlier , prevent kidney failure . You/your child high risk kidney injury kidney failure people , operation cardiopulmonary bypass ( machine pump your/your child 's blood operation ) . This research do test yet prove show kidney injury lead kidney failure . The urine blood test investigator study show indicate degree kidney injury certain people , accuracy need diagnose disease . The investigator think combination urine blood test try research study may provide enough information well diagnose kidney injury earlier stage . About 20 person 2 year old adult take part study .

	<detailed_description>Purpose : This ass whether sensitive test urine serum biomarkers able detect acute kidney injury follow cardiopulmonary bypass surgery context congenital heart disease . Background : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) define abrupt decrease renal function result retention nitrogenous ( urea creatinine ) non-nitrogenous waste product . AKI common complication follow cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) surgery , occur 30 % adult patient follow CPB surgery , increase morbidity , mortality , resource utilization . Patients cyanotic heart disease undergo CPB surgery also risk develop AKI . These patient require multiple surgery course lifetime correct congenital cardiac lesion . Cyanosis alone cause glomerulopathy characterize clinically sub-nephrotic range proteinuria , high prevalence relate length time prior initial corrective procedure . Pharmacological strategy treatment AKI show little efficacy previous study . Thus , recent study aim evaluate novel plasma urinary biomarkers early diagnosis AKI , base hypothesis outcome may improve AKI identified treatment initiate earlier . Urinary IL-18 NGAL show predictive marker AKI cardiopulmonary surgery pediatric population variety congenital heart defect . This ultimately reduce detection time 40 hour conventional serum creatinine assay , 4-6 hour urinary IL-18 NGAL . Serum Cystatin C also show reliable serum creatinine predict kidney filtration level , particularly subject reduce muscle mass population congenital heart disease . However , study evaluate utility marker combine pediatric adult congenital heart disease population . These patient unique multitude CPB surgery require throughout lifetime , degree life spend cyanotic , thus , may differ susceptibility cardiac surgery associate AKI . Our long term goal evaluate value urinary serum biomarkers early detection AKI unique patient population . Currently , investigator propose perform pilot study evaluate feasibility study method obtain preliminary data assist power calculation large study . Methods : The investigator enroll total 20 patient undergoing pulmonary valve replacement . All patient history conotruncal anomaly previous corrective surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass . Enrollment occur time cardiology cardiovascular surgery consultation . After informed consent assent obtain , urine serum sample collect study protocol . Urine specimens creatinine , NGAL , IL-18 collect pre-operatively baseline measurement addition post-operatively 6 , 12 , 24 , 72 hour . Cystatin C measure pre-operatively assess chronic renal function . Serum creatinine measure pre-operatively post-operatively 12 hour daily part usual clinical care . Patients follow 7 day surgery day hospital discharge , whichever occur first . Data collect hospital chart include : demographic , medical surgical history , type surgical procedure , underlie congenital heart disease , baseline serum creatinine renal function , serum creatinine ( ) throughout hospitalization , daily urine output , need dialysis , date death discharge . The primary endpoint development AKI base serum creatinine reach double baseline requirement acute dialysis , describe RIFLE- Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss , End Stage Renal Disease- model renal insufficiency .</detailed_description>
