	<brief_title>Oxygen Insufflation To Reduce Postoperative Abscess In Laparoscopic Appendectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intra-abdominal abscess well-known complication open laparoscopic appendectomy , especially set perforate gangrenous appendicitis . The reviewed literature cite incidence 10 % . Besides peri-operative antibiotic administration development reduce inherent risk . Oxygen rich environment potently bactericidal , thus hypothesis establish oxygen rich ambience within abdomen conclusion laparoscopy could curtail bacterial growth subsequent abscess formation . In experimental arm , conclusion surgical dissection manipulation , carbon dioxide insufflate exchange oxygen generate high intra-abdominal concentration . Oxygen infuse 15 second CO2 allow escape open trocars . In control arm Co2 allow escape open trocar port without oxygen flush . Patients receive standardized operation well standard post-operative care follow .</detailed_description>
