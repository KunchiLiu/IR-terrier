	<brief_summary>This randomize , control , open-label clinical trial conduct approximately 12 surgical pediatric intensive care unit ( SICU/NICU/PICU ) US , period 22 month , 6 month trial set-up , 12 month simultaneous subject enrollment 30 day treatment/follow-up period , 3 month study close-out . The study population consist least 60 male female pediatric subject 0 day 12 year age , undergoing cardiac , abdominal , orthopedic transplant surgery approximately equal number subject ( n=10 25 ) three four age group : ( 29 day 23 month ) , ( 2 5 year 11 month ) ( 6 year 12 year ) cohort . Regarding young age group 0 28 day , minimum number patient enrol study predefined small number elective surgical procedure expect population . Safety concern eventual safety signal , well recruitment rate , monitor annually ( start enrollment 60th subject ) independent Safety Monitoring Board ( SMB ) , appoint prior study initiation submit FDA . The responsibility SMB define ad hoc document , threshold acceptable safety also set . During conduct study first 60 patient , safety signal link primary safety endpoint ( i.e . pulmonary fluid overload ) imbalance incidence AEs treatment control group base relevant literature , judge SMB , enrolment increase 100 patient use age stratification approach define ( n=20 30 age group ) . Potential subject pre-screened informed consent/assent obtain subject and/or subject 's parent guardians prior surgery . Post-surgery , subject admit Surgical , Neonatal , Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( SICU/NICU/PICU ) postoperative recovery care management . Subjects show sign hypovolemia judge Principal Investigator ( PI ) screen determine eligibility participate trial . Subjects randomize receive treatment Kedbumin 25 % comparator , normal saline ( sodium chloride 0.9 % ) . There specific post-treatment regimen protocol , subject receive standard post-operative care base clinical status response treatment discretion Investigator . Vital sign fluid management/replacement therapy record medical chart result standard complete blood count ( CBC ) , biochemistry , hematology coagulation lab panel review record research staff specify time point , accord hospital standard care . Additionally , research staff review record daily lactate , urine albumin , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , non-invasive measurement follow time point : Baseline , 6hr , 12hr , 24hr , 36hr , 48hr , 72hr post-onset hypovolemia ) , hemodynamic stability achieve . Hemodynamic stability evaluate base site-specific age-defined reference range heart rate , blood pressure , urine output , cardiac index child . The volume , rate frequency Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP , either Kedbumin 25 % normal saline ) administer record addition type , timing , amount fluid administer . The time hemodynamic stability , duration stability attain , relapse require additional treatment use secondary resuscitation strategy record . Subjects demonstrate hemodynamic stability within 3 day treatment initiation relapse hemodynamic instability result surgical complication infection exit study , data consider safety analysis . These subject continue treatment accord clinical practice standard since study intend evaluate efficacy Kedbumin 25 % .</brief_summary>
