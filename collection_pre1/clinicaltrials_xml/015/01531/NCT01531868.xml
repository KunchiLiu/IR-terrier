	<brief_summary>Background : In previous study , information verbally present relative risk ( e.g . `` 50 % less likely '' ) qualitative risk ( e.g . `` significantly less likely '' ) result many people ( 66 % ) choose surgical procedure narrow artery neck people present absolute risk ( e.g . `` 11 % versus 5 % 5 year '' ) , annualized risk ( e.g . `` 2 % versus 1 % per year 5 year '' ) event-free survival ( e.g . `` 95 % versus 89 % 5 year '' ) ( 33 % ) . Objectives : The purpose study determine whether observation true information present visually bar graph . In addition , investigator also seek determine whether subject feel understand information well present visually compare verbally . Methods : 450 subject approach neurology clinic wait office visit . If subject agree participate 10 minute study , take quiet room watch 1 minute video laptop . The video feature act physician . The presenter experiment group . The presenter describe hypothetical medical situation narrow one carotid ( neck ) arteries present . The presenter describe risk stroke related condition subject choose medical therapy versus medical surgical therapy . The presentation risk vary may present one 3 different way include qualitative description , absolute risk reduction fix time period , relative risk reduction . These three risk group present either verbally visually bar graph . In visual subject group , presenter hold graph remain silent graph show . The amount time allot graph video equal amount time take presenter say information auditory subject group . Given 2 sensory modality ( verbal visual ) 3 different presentation format , total 6 different video . After video complete , subject ask complete 1 page survey ask patient 's age , gender , educational level , reason medical visit , final decision choice treatment . The subject also answer well understood data make mark 10 cm horizontal line .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Sensory Presentation Formats Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A previous randomized study find verbal presentation benefit surgery asymptomatic carotid stenosis express qualitative relative risk result high proportion ( 66 % versus 33 % ) subject choose surgery compare subject present absolute risk , yearly risk , event-free survival . Other variable increase choice surgery male gender , young age , high level education . Nevertheless , presentation format strong predictor treatment choice . Objective/Hypothesis : To determine whether presentation format affect visual representation information . The investigator hypothesis visual representation positive negative outcome single bar graph result less subject favor surgery compare show relative information bar graph . The investigator also hypothesize subject show visual information express great understanding information present compare give verbal information . Specific Aims : 1 ) To determine whether presentation format affect visual representation information . 2 ) To determine whether subject give visual representation information express great understand information compare subject give verbal representation information . Study Design : 450 subject approach neurology clinic wait office visit . Subjects without carotid stenosis approach randomly principal investigator one co-investigators . They ask participate study complete office visit physician . In event patient expect long 30 minute delay see physician , ask participate study prior office visit . If subject agree participate 10 minute study , take quiet room watch 1 minute video laptop . The video feature act physician . The presenter experiment group . The presenter describe hypothetical medical situation narrow one carotid arteries present . The presenter describe risk stroke related condition subject choose medical therapy versus medical surgical therapy . The presentation risk vary may present one 3 different way include qualitative description , absolute risk reduction fix time period , relative risk reduction . These three risk group present either verbally visually bar graph . In visual subject group , presenter hold graph remain silent graph show . The amount time allot graph video equal amount time take presenter say information auditory subject group . Given 2 sensory modality ( verbal visual ) 3 different presentation format , total 6 different video . Randomization perform select video number opaque envelope . The subject allow watch video 3 time , request . After video complete , subject ask complete 1 page survey ask patient 's age , gender , educational level , reason medical visit , final decision choice treatment . The subject also answer well understood data make mark 10 cm horizontal line . A mark right signifies well understand mark place leave .
