	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Primary Abdominal Closure Vacuum Assisted Laparostomy Treatment Severe Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Severe peritonitis belongs among severe disease mortality 20-60 % . Causes number primary surgical disease ( inflammatory acute abdomen syndromes - perforate diverticulitis , perforated tumor , colon ischemia ) complication abdominal surgery frequency 12-16 % . Secondary tertiary peritonitis insult cause system inflammatory response ( SIRS ) subsequent sepsis multi-organ failure ; serious state patient require long term costly intensive care despite often end permanent disability . Basic therapy severe peritonitis surgical treatment origin abdominal sepsis , contamination elimination prevention postoperative complication . The insufficient capability manage postoperative complication ( polymorbidity , diabetes , inveterate peritonitis , immunosuppressed patient ) often cause organ mutli-organ failure . In case primary closure abdominal cavity correct surgical treatment ; solution early diagnosis complication urgent sanitation . Mostly objective reason delay complication diagnosis thus adequate treatment . Other negative consequence primary closure abdominal cavity case development intraabdominal complicate heal development intraabaominal hypertension even compartment syndrome negative influence organ function . Alternative introduce laparostomy enable simple abdominal cavity control ( second look method ) use repeat intervention . Classical laparostomy however continual continuation tertiary contamination . According known literal source recommendation mean abdominal cavity closure give surgical disease therapeutically efficient . One modern laparostomy method closure abdominal cavity use VAC . Method principle active suction continual drain effusion abdominal cavity thus reduce intraabdominal bacterial contamination also support blood circulation vitality wound edge . It method fulfills advantage laparotomy include expansion abdominal cavity , effusion drainage quality control ; close system risk external contamination case common laparostomy . Use VAC method verify various wound type copious secretion ( sternotomy , diabetic foot fascitis ) . Method VAC laparostomy describe ; however prospective randomize use peritonitis bee evaluate yet . Aim project : The aim project prove reduce mortality , morbidity hospitalization length ( cost reduction ) prospective randomize study patient treat due severe peritonitis use VAC method comparison classical approach ( primary closure abdominal cavity ; secondary solution complication ) . Secondary aim validate score system early sepsis marker ( cytokine ) algorithm assessment severance severe peritonitis condition inclusion indication surgical revision . Tertiary aim determine group patient would profit method . Further aim compare cost socio-economic implication therapy option . Hypothesis : Primary introduction surgical revision due severe peritonitis reduces postoperative morbidity mortality comparison primary closure abdominal cavity . Indications repeat intervention improve combination score system immunohistochemistry marker . Methodology 1- assessment preoperative stave patient - APACHE II ( Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation , ASA , BMI ) , severity clinical surgical finding . 2 - Assessment influence select method primary treatment abdominal cavity postoperative morbidity express monitoring basic vital function , SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ) , intraabdominal pressure monitoring , serum level cytokine monitoring , postoperative complication , surgical revision length hospitalization . 3 - long term socioeconomic consequence ( 30 day follow discharge - questionnaire , assessment life quality ) , cost analysis expend hospitalization include medication , surgery well postoperative outpatient control visit . Patient severe peritonitis enrol study accord Mannheim Peritonitis Index ( MPI ) - 20-25 accord sex ; APACHE II 10 . Expected sample size total 50 patient ( 25 treat use VAC method ) versus 25 control group ) . Screening include patient designer fulfil SIRS criterion prior abdominal approach and/or display symptom peritonitis . If patient fulfills criterion agree inclusion study , his/her ID enter electronic database generate inclusion one two group accord randomization scheme - surgery termination use VAC method primary suture . Excluded patient : young patient young 18 year ; mental state patient enable proper information signature inform consent form ( see bellow ) inclusion study ; patient assume live long 48 hour surgery ( APACHE II , Karnofski , SOFA ) . Preoperative care actual surgical procedure direct subject study conduct accord far know procedure . Surgeon close abdominal cavity accord randomization end procedure fact way affect actual surgery procedure . Patient treat surgical ICU . First exchange VAC dress conduct 24-48 hour subsequently call demand ( patient health state aggravation define score SOFA increase 4 point ; elevation inflammatory marker interleukin ) . After complete sanitation origin investigator close laparostomy ( serous exudate ) If technically possible suture abdominal cavity accord layer , investigator close use follow alternative : single skin cover , mesh plasty , cover celless skin implant ( permacol surgical implant ) abdominal cavity close soon possible . Patient primary close abdominal cavity ( control group ) treat accord far know procedure . In case inflammation sign investigator search treat focus . Cytokine inflammatory marker also monitor include find . In case surgical complication investigator proceed standard manner ( SSI ) . VAC method use case patient . Hospitalization terminate criterion compliance : oral intake high 2 liter tolerance ; sufficient oral analgesic ; patient display infection sign ; agree hospitalization ; surgical wound treatable outpatient clinic . Means data collection Preoperative examination monitor apart basic data age , diagnosis , co-morbidity score ASA , BMI , level inflammatory parameter ( CRP , blood count , biochemistry examination ) . Patient must fulfill criterion SIRS enrol study display sign peritonitis . Precise indication surgery record . After introduction anesthesia investigator perform examination arterial blood ( ASTRUP ) calculate APACHE Extent inflammation ( MPI ) evaluate source infection ( confirmation exclusion preoperative diagnosis ) . Performed surgical procedure describe , investigator monitor duration surgery ; blood loss ; monitor whether sufficient control primary source ( insufficient treatment source sufficient exclusion criterion ) . Daily investigator monitor IL-1 , 6 , 8 , 10 TNF alpha ICU ( first 5 day ) , SOFA score calculate IAP measure . The investigator monitor frequency VAC exchange ; number administrate transfusion ; duration UPV ; day without oral intake without possibility physiotherapy - walking ( parameter recovery . Conscious patient submit form assessment life quality ( SF-36 ) 7th postoperative day . The investigator monitor pain use VAS . Entry value : hospitalization length , number ICU day ; mean wound closure ( primary suture , delayed suture VAC ; skin cover ) . Incidence severity SSI ( I-III grade ) nosocomial infection ( health care - associate infection - HAI ) . Patient completes assess life quality ( SF-36 ) prior discharge . Active follow term study conduct via telephone every 30th day discharge . Patient subsequently complete mail questionnaire assess life quality ( SF-36 ) . Outpatient control necessary repeat hospitalization complicate patient . After completion patient monitoring analysis cost hospitalization include medication , surgery postoperative outpatient control conduct use hospital information system . Statistical processing Sample size estimate base expect percentage indicator accord Fleisse . Other sample size estimate estimate use standard method . Each sample must contain 26 -47 patient mortality estimate 30-40 % case statistically significant difference 20-30 % 5 % level significance test power 70 % case one side test . Morbidity estimate 60 % clinically significant difference 30-40 % require sample size 19-32 subject provide significance level one side test . Statistical evaluation result include base pair test . Difference individual variable group evaluate use Student pair test non-parametric variant ( Wilcoxon test ) . SOFA , APACHE II score life quality assessment result ( SF-36 ) evaluate use Hotelling test multi directional generalization Student test . Time schedule : 1. year project : design randomization program ; personal education study protocol ; software design ; inclusion 18 patient . Data processing . Results evaluate end year ; statistician evaluate homogeneity group . 2. year project : inclusion 18 patient . Data analysis perform subgroup analysis partial result process present . 3. year project : inclusion last 14 patient . Follow termination . Definite data collection , analysis , result evaluation include financial analysis . Standard proposal . Presentation national international forum , publication . Discussion Surgical treatment inseparable part patient care severe peritonitis . Advance monitoring important identification risk patient also possible surgical revision indication . Generally use sepsis marker include score system ( APACHE II , MOSF - Multiple Organ System Failure , MODS - Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score ) however react certain delay . Possible demand re-laparotomy perform afterwards patient severe condition MODS . On hand plan re-laparotomies conduct excessively . Not even met-analysis clinical study prove clear preference one procedure ( 23 ) . New method VAC however evaluate prospective randomize study indication . Inclusion early marker septic state - IL-1 , 6 , 8 , 10 TNF alpha - indication re-laparotomy VAC exchange could large clinical benefit . Further controversial indication parameter commonly measure ICU size development IAP present important correlation laboratory sign inflammation lead design special index . VAC method use advantage - active close intraabdominal secretion restrict possibility spread HAI . Significant reduce frequency dressing ; enable simple physiotherapy patient ; condition anabolic phase necessary healing ( 24 ) . Analysis patient number benefit method ( intention-to treat ) general cost necessary . Designer 's work site treat 19 patient last 18 month use method . Mortality 15.8 % average hospitalization length 59.2 day compliance far publish result . However prospective randomize study VAC method however use last therapeutic option . Information Working site need surgical equipment include equipment perform VAC ; VAC use method 5 year ; apart purchase consumption material owner pump . This method use treat different wound . Principal investigator co-worker experience method . Co-investigator even numerous experience clinical study publish result journal . Other specific equipment necessary study procedure . Conclusion Detected result background verification efficacy VAC introduction laparostomy patient surgical revision due severe peritonitis . Efficacy new standard laboratory clinical marker septic state . Expected result , aim , priority significance project Study output consist data usable design recommend procedure surgical patient care severe peritonitis . Standardized protocol introduce ICU patient reflect laboratory method clinical parameter clinically influence therapy . Detailed analysis group enable precise indication single surgical intervention ensure efficient thus cost wise preferable therapy . Simple universal software create term study manage patient database thus enable rapid concurrent assessment health care quality . With regard similar complex prospective study publish national international magazine , publication impact journal ; socioeconomic analysis publish especially national medical journal would easily accessible .</detailed_description>
