	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient often confine bedrest , nature illness . However , show prolonged bedrest immobility , particularly critically ill adult child , lead serious outcome muscle weakness prolong stay intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Research adult demonstrate prevent immobility introduce exercise rehabilitation adult patient early ICU illness prevent serious outcome , reduce duration hospital stay , enhance recovery leave ICU . The purpose research investigate early mobilization rehabilitation also perform critically ill child , eventually evaluate result beneficial outcome child , show adult . However , give child adult , vary ability understand participate activity sick , investigator first evaluate appropriate safe way help child `` exercise '' ICU . This objective study evaluate 2 method rehabilitation ( stationary bike interactive video game ) implement critically ill child . These method use hospitalized child critically ill adult . The investigator evaluate method safe critically ill child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In prospective cohort pilot study , eligible critically ill child age 3 17 year receive addition usual care , passive and/or active mobility intervention , depend level consciousness cognitive ability . The active intervention consist interactive video game ( X Box 360 Kinect ) , cycle ergometer use passive intervention . The mobility intervention apply minimum 10 minute day 1 , 20 minute day 2 . For unconscious patient , eligible patient cognitively impaired , passive intervention apply . As soon patient conscious cooperative , active intervention apply . The primary outcome interest pilot study feasibility ( defined ability screen enroll patient , consent rate protocol adherence ) . Secondary outcomes interest include safety outcome , clinical outcome patient caregiver satisfaction intervention .</detailed_description>
