	<brief_summary>Chronic Allograft Nephropathy ( CAN ) /Interstitial fibrosis Tubular Atrophy ( IFTA ) responsible kidney transplant failure . CAN/IFTA 3 month kidney biopsy strongly predict graft survival long term . CAN/IFTA remain vex problem clinician current monitoring tool , namely serum creatinine concentration , sensitive early change glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) histologic damage . Despite advance prevention acute rejection ( AR ) , still significant potentially devastate complication solid organ transplantation . One strategy reduce risk rejection perform kidney biopsy detect subclinical acute rejection ( SCAR ) treat prevent progression rejection . There evidence treating SCAR prevent immune mediate injury kidney , precursor CAN/IFTA . Kidney biopsy provide good information limit due safety concern , patient preference cost issue . Better , early less invasive marker CAN/IFTA allow early intervention well improve graft well patient outcomes . This study seek validate specific proteogenomic biomarker panel AR CAN/IFTA prospective blood , urine kidney tissue monitoring study kidney transplant recipient schedule standard care biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center sample study . A total number 250 subject consent enrol Northwestern University Transplant clinic time kidney biopsy . At clinic , protocol biopsy may perform 3 month , 12 month , 24 month time doctor feel necessary post transplant kidney recipient . Kidney transplant recipient may also go `` cause '' biopsy procedure time point before/after protocol biopsy time point . Such cause biopsy include increase serum creatinine level , decrease urine output , and/or pain graft site . Full blood tube set , urine sample proteomics flow cytometry urinary sediment , extra core kidney biopsy tissue gene expression profile collect subject time biopsy obtain study course . These specimen sample send Rules-Based Medicine ( RBM ) proteomic analysis . Whole genome expression profile do use Affymetrix GeneChips The Scripps Research Institute . We estimate find least 50 subject diagnostic CAN/IFTA histology ( Banff 1-2 ) 3 month 12 month post transplant protocol biopsy base 50 % incidence literature experience . We also estimate 10 % ( 10 subject ) incidence clinical rejection end 12 month identify initially acute rise serum creatinine confirm biopsy . Lastly , estimate 10 % ( 10 subject ) incidence subclinical acute rejection stable renal function detect protocol kidney biopsy .</detailed_description>
