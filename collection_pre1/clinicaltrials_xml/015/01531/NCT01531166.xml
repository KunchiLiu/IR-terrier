	<brief_summary>The current propose study aim bring answer follow issue : antiviral efficacy safety profile Korean Chronic Hepatitis B ( CHB ) patient mostly infect solely genotype C HBV , proper duration Pegasys® therapy post-treatment durability accumulation HBeAg seroconversion/HBsAg loss , preventable effect long-term disease progression liver cirrhosis liver cancer . In addition , study aim collect data efficacy safety real-life clinical setting Pegasys® therapy patient CHB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cohort Study Korean Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B ( CHB ) Receiving Pegylated Interferon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Korea know endemic area HBV infection . Some study report 95 % patient Korea chronic HBV genotype C infection . - Compared genotype , genotype C associate increased viral load , high histologic activity , severe acute exacerbation , longer viral clearance phase bad antiviral response peg-interferon therapy . - Long-term nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NA ) therapy recommend chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patient compensate decompensated liver disease . However , possibility cessation antiviral treatment oral NAs unlikely due rebound HBV DNA level termination NAs administration . In addition , NA therapy report low chance HBsAg seroclearance compare immunomodulatory agent peginterferon . - Pegasys® prove induce HBsAg loss , close cure disease . However , good understand HBV treatment Pegasys® real-life clinical set Korea helpful decision treatment strategy future . Asian experience Pegasys® therapy CHB limit . Study population investigator-initiated trial consist select group small number Korean patient . Therefore , long-term efficacy safety data real practice Pegasys® treatment HBeAg-positive -negative Korean patient necessary . - In addition , current propose collect data study may helpful bring answer many unresolved issue : antiviral efficacy safety profile Korean CHB patient mostly infect solely genotype C HBV , proper duration Pegasys® therapy post-treatment durability accumulation HBeAg seroconversion/HBsAg loss , preventable effect long-term disease progression liver cirrhosis liver cancer . In addition , study aim collect data efficacy safety real-life clinical setting Pegasys® therapy patient CHB .</detailed_description>
