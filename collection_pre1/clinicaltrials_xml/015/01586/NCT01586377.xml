	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology CRPS-1 unknown yet considerable number study suggest fundamental cause abnormal pain due microvascular pathology deep tissue . Reduced blood flow deep tissue muscle , nerve , bone lead combination inflammatory neuropathic pain process ( Coderre TJ et al . 2010 ) . Evidence support model microcirculatory dysfunction include observation skin capillary oxygenation decrease skin lactate increase affected limbs patient ( total 11 patient lactate study ) ( Birklein F et al . 2000 , Manahan AP et al . 2007 ) . It also report patient CRPS-I abnormal vasodilatory response sympathetically-mediated vasoconstriction ( Dayan L et al . 2008 ) decrease concentration nitric oxide affect limb ( Groeneweg JG et al . 2006 ) . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive method measure tissue oxygenation use differential absorption property oxygenate deoxygenated hemoglobin biological tissue ( Creteur J 2008 ) . Near-infrared light transmit small vessel diameter less 1 mm ( arteriole , venule capillary ) . Since NIRS limit monitor small vessel , use assess oxygen balance microcirculation skeletal muscle ( Creteur J 2008 ) . Premises Premise 1 : Complex regional pain syndrome associate microcirculatory dysfunction After injury patient 's limb , hypothesize pressure exert swell within relatively confined anatomical space occlude capillary adjacent tissue cause compartment syndrome-like injury . Coderre et al . ( 2010 ) theorize result microcirculatory dysfunction cause persistent inflammatory state responsible pain generation . In animal model ischemia-reperfusion injury use study CRPS-1 , microscopy muscle nerve tissue demonstrate microvascular evidence slow-flow/no-reflow phenomenon ( Coderre TJ et al . 2010 ) . Existence slow-flow/no-reflow state cause persistent inflammation deep tissue . Animals subsequently develop hyperemia edema , follow mechano-hyperalgesia , allodynia , cold-allodynia lasting least 1 month ( Coderre et al . 2010 ) . This clinical picture similar clinical sign patient afflict CRPS-1 . Premise 2 : Vascular occlusion test measure microcirculatory dysfunction NIRS measurement peripheral tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) , combine reproducible ischemia-reperfusion challenge induce reactive hyperemia ( vascular occlusion test - VOT ) , describe valid reliable method assess microcirculatory dysfunction ( De Backer et al . 2010 ) . This involve short period forearm ischemia inflate blood pressure cuff upper arm . The blood pressure cuff release approximately 3 minute follow reperfusion forearm . This stimulate release endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) microvascular endothelium ( Harel et al 2008 ) . Measurement hyperemic response use NIRS demonstrate feasible non-invasive method quantify microcirculatory function . This technique share strong correlation gold-standard method strain gauge plethysmography ( Harel et al . 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
