	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy often use help shrink cancer temporarily may improve survival patient incurable pancreas cancer spread organ . In Canada , gemcitabine chemotherapy use treat pancreas cancer spread . The combination oxaliplatin chemotherapy , include 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan also studied benefit patient advance pancreas cancer . To date , test do patient 's tumour tell chemotherapy work pancreatic cancer . Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 ( hENT1 ) show possible predictor gemcitabine may may work need proven randomize study patient get treated gemcitabine different kind chemotherapy tumour get test hENT1 . This study do want prove hENT1 predict gemcitabine work advance pancreas cancer , also would like show different chemotherapy combination call FOLFOX ( combination 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin ) helpful patient whose tumours n't hENT1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study See hENT1 Testing Tumour Tissue Can Predict Response Treatment With Gemcitabine Chemotherapy Different Chemotherapy Called FOLFOX Better Than Gemcitabine Metastatic Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-clinical retrospective clinical data indicate hENT1 may predictive prognostic biomarker gemcitabine ( Gem ) efficacy . To ultimately prove use biomarker , prospective randomize study hENT1 stratification require . This study would provide high level confidence , would , positive , vault Gem select anticancer agent truly sensitive population rationally treat . By `` molecular triage '' , risk/benefit ratio Gem therapy pancreas cancer ( PC ) could meaningfully improve also provide rationale use different treatment regimen tumours low hENT1 . The comparator arm FOLFOX chosen recent data show impressive patient outcome use oxaliplatin-based treatment . This randomized , open-label , multicentre , phase III trial eligible patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma randomize Gem FOLFOX predefined upfront test hENT1 . To eligible , patient adequate tissue available hENT1 test Cross Cancer Institute ( CCI ) ensure prior treatment randomization . Patients tumour sample test expression hENT1 . A blinded pathologist expertise knowledge experience hENT1 stain lead centre ( CCI ) responsible pathologic hENT1 classification via IHC . hENT1 IHC determine score previously outline . ( 1 ) Once hENT1 status confirm , patient randomize 1:1 Gem FOLFOX . Patients treat study disease progression , overwhelming toxicity , patient withdrawal consent . Dose adjustment one study drug base toxicity encounter individual patient . Specific dose-adjustment treatment guideline hematologic non-hematologic toxicity include neutropenia , diarrhea , renal toxicity , neurotoxicity outline protocol . Prior enrolment , screen procedure document compliance inclusion exclusion criterion . The primary endpoint determination difference PFS two study arm , define study start date either increase sum product diameter measurable lesion ≥ 20 % base revise RECIST guideline version 1.1 ( 2 ) , appearance new lesion , deterioration clinical status consistent disease progression . Secondary endpoint determination difference overall response rate ( ORR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , overall survival ( OS ) . Administered dose intensity Gem FOLFOX report . Health-related quality life ( HRQL ) assess duration active treatment study . Patient Population : The target population patient measurable metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas previously treat systemic therapy metastatic disease tumour sample amenable hENT1 testing . Fine needle aspiration biopsy permit . Patients receive prior chemotherapy deliver part initial curative therapy ( i.e . neoadjuvant , adjuvant , and/or concurrently deliver radiation and/or surgery ) permit long treatment complete least 6 month prior study start date . Patients may receive prior radiotherapy surgery ≥ 4 week study entry must recover toxic effect prior therapy . Patients locally advance adenocarcinoma pancreas exclude . Full inclusion exclusion criterion detail protocol . Study Objectives : Primary Objective : To determine difference PFS Gem FOLFOX treat patient hENT1 high hENT1 low pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) To determine difference ORR two treatment arm ; 2 ) To determine rate disease control , define sum complete response rate , partial response rate , stable disease two treatment arm ; 3 ) To determine difference OS two treatment arm ; 4 ) To determine difference HRQL patient two treatment arm . Exploratory Objectives : 1 ) To investigate role hCNT3 interaction hENT1-related patient outcome . 2 ) To evaluate excision repair cross complement 1 ( ERCC1 ) microsatellite instability ( MSI ) tumour sample , increasingly link efficacy oxaliplatin-based therapy information PC lacking . Duration Treatment : Treatment continue objective symptomatic disease progression , overwhelming toxicity , patient withdrawal consent . A patient may continue receive combination study drug long investigator feel appropriate , discontinue study case : 1 ) Clinical and/or radiological document disease progression ( determine revise RECIST 1.1 criterion ) . ( 2 ) All drug discontinue patient remove study ; 2 ) Occurrence unacceptable toxicity ( may due one drug result one study drug discontinuation ) ; three drug discontinue patient remove study ; 3 ) Failure recover hematologic and/or non-hematologic toxicity re-treatment level despite dose interruption 28 day ( may due one study drug result one study drug discontinuation ) ; drug regimen discontinue patient remove study ; 4 ) Patient 's request ( withdrawal consent ) Investigator 's recommendation ( may one study drug ) ; three study drug discontinue patient remove study ; 5 ) Patient death ( complete Serious Adverse Event Report death occur within 30 day last study drug dose OR death occur 30 day , consider related study drug ) . Efficacy Endpoints : Response assessment perform every 8 week , regardless treatment cycle . History , physical exam , laboratory work , image , ECOG performance status ( PS ) , require response assessment . PS measure use ECOG performance status scale . Tumor marker ( CA19-9 ) may follow discretion investigator use determination disease response requirement study . Tumor response evaluate accord revise RECIST criterion 1.1 . ( 2 ) Symptomatic progression define new worsen disease symptom deem treat oncologist incompatible continuation study medication requirement palliative radiation therapy fall ECOG performance status ≥ 3 deem due disease study treatment . Should symptomatic progression occur , image confirm progression advise possible due performance status , study stop date record date progression . Safety : The NCI CTCAE ( version 4.0 ) use evaluate clinical safety treatment study . Subjects assessed adverse event clinical visit necessary throughout study . Safety assess via vital sign , physical exam , laboratory test ( include hematologic , serum chemistry , liver function testing ) , adverse event determination . Pregnant nursing female exclude participation trial .</detailed_description>
