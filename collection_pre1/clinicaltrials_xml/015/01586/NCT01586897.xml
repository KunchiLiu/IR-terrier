	<brief_summary>This project test model chronic disease medication management decision initiate adjust medical therapy directly link sequence subsequent clinical action ( e.g . monitoring adverse drug event , assess response therapy , change medication dose ) perform independently office visit . The investigator hypothesize establish visit-independent , health information technology ( IT ) support cycle laboratory monitor iterative medication dose adjustment result effective chronic disease care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Medication Metronome Project - Study Facilitate Follow-up Testing Resulting From Prescribed Medications Improve Patient Safety Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To implement new model chronic disease management , build exist electronic health record integrate data system develop advanced health IT application call `` Medication Metronome '' enable provider schedule future laboratory test relate specific set medication ( glycemic , cholesterol , blood pressure management ) . As lab test date become due , Medication Metronome system remind patient via letter inform provider test remain `` miss . '' The goal intervention implement efficient , visit-independent system ensure patient rapidly safely bring evidence-based treatment goal prevent delay plan laboratory monitoring . This study follow aim : Aim 1 : To develop Medication Metronome system . This work involve health IT development evaluation design prototypes create system support timely medication intensification , improve safety , meet patient provider need . Aim 2 : To conduct randomize controlled trial Medication Metronome system . We use three target chronic condition test different element system . We hypothesize use Medication Metronome system lead : H2a . More effective HbA1c control among patient type 2 diabetes prescribe hypoglycemic medicine ; H2b . Safer medication management among patient hypertension prescribe thiazide diuretic , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker ; H2c . Both effective LDL-cholesterol control safer monitoring hepatitis among patient hyperlipidemia prescribed HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor . Aim 3 : To evaluate impact Medication Metronome visit-independent care model content office-based visit . Time spent address different clinical care domain assess use audiotape-based content analysis subset select office visit . Summary : We implement , rigorously evaluate health IT-supported model visit-independent medication management design enable safer effective chronic disease care . We also carefully investigate impact system primary care visit . The broad goal work support health delivery redesign foster patient-centered primary care combine visit-independent medication management productive visit-based patient-provider interaction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All primary care physician participate practice eligible participate study . Patients Eligible Analysis : The primary unit analysis prescribed medicine , group patient within prescribe PCP . Three potentially overlap medicationbased cohort define : 1 ) Patients prescribed hypoglycemic agent , 2 ) Patients prescribed thiazide diuretic , ACEIs , ARBs , 3 ) Patients prescribed statin . Based design , individual patient may contribute one medication analytic cohort . Patients Excluded Analysis : Patients subsequently identify died course study intervention use Social Security Death Index , leave MGH system , change PCPs .</criteria>
