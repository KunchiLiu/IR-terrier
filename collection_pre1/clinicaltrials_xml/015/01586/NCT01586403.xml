	<criteria>Patients must diagnosis metastatic melanoma measurable either clinically radiologically . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients must consent study must sign date approved consent form , conform federal institutional guideline . Patients must performance status 0 1 ECOG PS scale ( see Appendix B ) . The ability provide write informed consent prior study specific screening procedure , understand patient right withdraw study time . Patients ' melanoma must positive tyrosinase HLAA2 per Loyola University Medical Center pathologic review FNA/core/excisional biopsy lesion . Cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 50 % determine screening echocardiogram . Patients undergone treatment antiCTLA4 ( Cytotoxic TLymphocyte Antigen 4 ) antibody must least 3 month last dose CTLA4 antibody enrol study . The patient BRAF mutation status position 600 must know prior enrollment . Patients V600E mutation eligible fail Vemurafenib therapy offer Vemurafenib therapy refuse . Patients treat prior Interleukin2 allow study . Special class subject fetus , pregnant woman , child , prisoner , institutionalized individual , others likely vulnerable . ECOG performance status 2 great . Patients history metastatic melanoma involve brain exclude active disease active disease within prior six month control surgery radiotherapy . Patients take steroids disease control pain management Patients must pregnant nursing potentially harmful effect agent develop fetus . Women/men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method . Patients whose BRAF V600E mutation status unknown , BRAF V600E mutation respond Vemurafenib therapy , BRAF V600E mutation offer option receive Vemurafenib therapy treatment melanoma . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree five year . Patients undergone Tyrosinase immunotherapy . Patients undergone immunotherapy combination nonmyeloablative chemotherapy .
