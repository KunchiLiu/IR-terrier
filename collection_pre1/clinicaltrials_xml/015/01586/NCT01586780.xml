	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) associate increase risk cardiovascular disease , suggest reduction postprandial glycaemia important lower fast blood glucose level reach optimal metabolic control reduce risk complication T2D . Observational study indicate milk consumption reduces risk develop T2D , obesity cardiovascular disease , possible protective mechanism ascribe protein fraction . It previously demonstrate addition whey protein , co-ingested carbohydrate , stimulates insulin secretion reduces postprandial glycaemia healthy subject well T2D patient . The effect mediate insulinogenic property whey appear stem generation particular amino acid ( AA ) pattern postprandial blood ingestion whey protein . In presently describe project hypothesize exchange part whey protein insulinogenic AA might useful optimize insulinogenic effect . Additionally , soy protein suggest beneficial effect insulin resistance obesity well satiety . The possible effect soy protein insulin response glycaemic regulation therefore also interest . A randomized , single blind , within-subject trial perform . The test meal provide breakfast 7 different occasion random order approximately 1 week test . The test subject instruct drink protein drink immediately prior eat standardized sandwich meal . Altogether , protein drink sandwich meal consume within 12 min .</detailed_description>
