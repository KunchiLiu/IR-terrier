	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) syndromes disorder characterize enzyme deficiency , link heart health complication . However , currently prove marker heart artery health population . The main purpose observational study evaluate ease convenience non-invasive measurement artery function MPS I , MPS II MPS VI patient compare healthy control subject . An observational study research design meaning treatment study . The research question : 1 . Is artery health MPS I , II VI patient different healthy control ? 2 . Is artery health MPS VI patient different MPS I II patient ? It hypothesize MPS patient poorer outcomes artery health compare healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) syndromes disorder characterize enzyme deficiency . As result enzyme deficiency , glycosaminoglycans normally recycle healthy individual degrade MPS patient . MPS syndromes link heart health complication . Complications related coronary artery stenosis ( narrow ) recognize potentially fatal sequela untreated treated MPS . Presently , national guideline largely silent coronary artery disease risk population . There currently validate marker cardiovascular coronary artery disease MPS population . The main purpose observational study evaluate ease convenience non-invasive measurement artery function MPS I , MPS II MPS VI patient compare healthy control subject . Exploring validity usefulness non-invasive measurement first step towards develop validated marker cardiovascular coronary artery disease MPS population . Specific Aim # 1 : Compare carotid artery intima-media thickness carotid stiffness individual MPS I , II , VI ( treat non-treated ) vs. healthy age-and gender-matched control . It hypothesize MPS patient increase carotid artery thickness reduce carotid compliance distensibility compare healthy control . Specific Aim # 2 : Compare carotid artery intima-media thickness carotid stiffness individual MPS VI v . I II MPS I patient clinically treat HSCT vs. ERT . It hypothesize MPS VI decrease carotid thickness increase carotid compliance distensibility compare MPS I II MPS I patient treat ERT increase carotid thickness reduce carotid compliance distensibility compare MPS I patient treat HSCT .</detailed_description>
