	<brief_summary>Thyroid cancer relatively rare disease incidence increase many countries.. Early accurate diagnosis lead earlier treatment intervention recognise major factor determine good outcome . This study investigate new way diagnose thyroid cancer blood sample use proteomic genetic marker . The study take sample patient differentiate thyroid cancer measure relative quantity 1000 protein within blood . These measure explore see , use combination accurately diagnose thyroid cancer . If successful technique could extend routine screening could replace invasive test currently use . Participants require supply small sample blood , answer question medical history also consent medical record examine . A lifestyle questionnaire also supply participant . In case diagnosis predict condition participant aware medical team discus best interest patient GP require refer suitable specialist . The study run 24 month routinely process around 15 20 participant history thyroid cancer per month . All patient detail keep confidential non identifiable information leave clinic . The work publish successful validate another site , commercialise make available routine clinical use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project utilize two powerful technology diagnose endocrine disease : proteomics genetic ( RNA DNA ) marker . Proteomics relatively new , rapidly expand excite area biomedical research ( Robin et al , 2009 , Frolich et al , 2009 ) . Posttranslational modification proteins critical function . Modified proteins may marker cancer phenotypes therefore useful tumor marker ( Narimatsu et al , 2010 ) . Proteomic research thyroid cancer infancy ( Krause et al , 2009 ) . The available study thyroid cancer utilised tissue rather serum sample , nonetheless result encourage ( Brown et al , 2006 , Wang et al , 2006 , Netea-Maier et al , 2008 , Krause et al , 2007 , Moretz et al , 2008 ) . Genomic marker thyroid cancer describe increasingly use biopsy material accurate diagnosis . Among described marker point mutation ( BRAF V600E , NRAS codon 61 , HRAS codon 61 ) , gene rearrangement ( RET / PTC1 , RET / PTC3 , PAX8 / PPARgamma ) polymorphisms find useful ( Nikiforova Nikiforov , 2009 , Ohori et al , 2010 ) . There good evidence recurrent thyroid cancer small number thyroid cancer cell detect peripheral blood , sufficient quantity detect thyroid-specific mRNA RT PCR ( Karavitaki et al , 2005 , Barbosa et al , 2008 , Milas et al , 2009 ) . Most study focus detection thyroglobulin mRNA moderate success . A significant difficulty approach detection thyroglobulin mRNA peripheral blood distinguish presence normal thyroid tissue thyroid cancer . The project collaborative venture Newcastle Biomedicine , NHS , Biosignatures Ltd ( North-East base proteomics diagnostics company ) . Biosignatures invest great deal research optimize sample handle sample analysis , thus give rise plasma proteomic protocol stable suitable large comparative study ( Elliott et al , Jackson et al , 2010 , Bramwell et al , 2007 ) . The data generate plasma 2D gel electrophoresis mass spectroscopy analyse proprietary `` supervise learn '' technology . The system give multiple example group class ( disease case ) derive signature pattern ( 'proteomic fingerprint ' ) allow class discriminate . This signature validate novel patient dataset ensure robust disease status discrimination . The combination research technology produce blood derive signature disease apply clinical setting ( Cash Argo , 2009 , Borthwick et al , 2009 ) . Thyroid cancer affect 2000 new patient UK per annum ( Cancer Research UK ) . Once initial treatment thyroid cancer complete ( thyroidectomy follow radioiodine ablation ) , monitor essential detect residual disease recurrence . Recurrence rate thyroid cancer high 30 % ( Mazzaferri Kloos , 2001 ) declare decades initial treatment , patient monitor regularly life . Monitoring disease recurrence consist iodine scan , ultrasound scan neck 6-8 month initial treatment , 6-12 monthly blood test thereafter serum marker thyroglobulin . Thyroglobulin valuable marker many people thyroid cancer ( Spencer Fatemi , 2006 ) . Unfortunately approximately 30 % patient antibody interference assay render test unreliable ( Spencer Fatemi , 2006 ) . In case patient subject repeated scan , though negative scan far less predictive value negative thyroglobulin blood test analyte measure reliably . We select thyroid cancer primary topic study proof concept follow reason : - Current diagnostics technology ( measurement serum thyroglobulin ) suffers interference measurement analyte 30 % case , render tumour marker entirely unreliable antibody present . Attempts use conventional biochemical analytical technology overcome problem past 3 decade fail . Thus proteomics/genomics approach perform good 70 % specificity provide superior diagnostic test . - The potential cost saving NHS development diagnostic test ( avoidance expensive scan ) considerable . - Exposure patient radiation repeat scan reduce obvious safety benefit . - The study non-interventional , induce additional discomfort , expect impact care receive participant stage . - Extrapolation technology evaluation thyroid nodule ( present clinically 5 % adult population ) even screen population thyroid malignancy , would profoundly beneficial preventative public health consequence .</detailed_description>
