	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Philips Sonalleve Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) device treat painful bone metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pain Palliation Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) non-invasive outpatient modality . In MR-HIFU , specially design ultrasound transducer use focus beam ultrasound energy small volume specific target site body . The focused beam intend produce therapeutic hyperthermia target field harmlessly warm immediately surround tissue . Magnetic Resonance Imaging use ultrasound treatment , focus ultrasound beam target field perform real-time thermal mapping around target . The Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system expect efficacious reduce pain score patient painful bone metastasis reduce pain medication usage .</detailed_description>
