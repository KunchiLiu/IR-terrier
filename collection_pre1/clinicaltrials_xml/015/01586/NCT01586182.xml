	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention ( case , stereotactic radiation boost ) . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean stereotactic radiation treatment still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve stereotactic radiation boost type cancer . In research study , investigator look high dose stereotactic radiation boost give safely . Because stereotactic radiation boost precise , investigator test whether use increase dose primary tumor without significantly increase side effect experience ; goal improve likelihood successfully treat tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After confirm eligible study willingness participate , perform radiation treatment stimulation , `` mapping session , '' within next two week . You may may receive intravenous contrast process , allow physician well see blood vessel neck . You place mask process help keep place treatment . All part standard radiation treatment . Approximately 14 day later , start radiation treatment primary tumor site lymph node chemotherapy week . The chemotherapy continue give one time per week week treatment . You receive radiation treatment 5 day week seven week . One day first second week treatment , instead typical radiation dose , receive dose stereotactic radiation boost site primary tumor ( total 2 dos stereotactic radiotherapy ) . Because look high dose stereotactic radiation boost administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect , everyone participates research study receive dose stereotactic radiation boost . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . We test 3 different dose level stereotactic radiation boost ; dose one 3 dos . The chemotherapy give one time per week , week , duration radiation treatment ( 7 week ) . The chemotherapy deliver intravenous fluid run vein arm . This chemotherapy would receive participate study . You see radiation oncologist least every week treatment . After final dose radiation treatment subsequent follow-up visit test perform accordance standard cancer care . You see radiation oncologist , without medical oncologist , follow time interval : 1 week treatment end , 1 month treatment end , 2 month treatment end , every 3 month two year . You undergo PET-CT scan neck CT scan time 3 month appointment . You study treatment 7 week progress follow part study 2 year treatment end .</detailed_description>
