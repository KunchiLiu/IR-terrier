	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis 1 ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) proton radiation therapy would result improved local control rate lower toxicity compare conventional radiotherapy , 2 ) proton radiation therapy would result equivalent improve local control rate similar low toxicity compare IMRT , treatment locally advance sinonasal malignancy . Data retrospective study suggest IMRT proton radiation therapy result promising outcome patient sinonasal malignancy . To date , prospective study conduct evaluate outcome sinonasal cancer treat IMRT proton radiation therapy . This Phase II trial first prospective study conduct determine treatment outcome toxicity IMRT proton treatment sinonasal cancer . IMRT proton radiation therapy two establish commonly employ advanced radiotherapy technique treatment sinonasal cancer . It highly controversial whether one superior term local control toxicity outcome . It also clear subset patient would benefit one treatment technology versus . Due rarity heterogeneity sinonasal malignancy fact proton beam available center United States , feasible present Phase III study randomize patient IMRT proton radiation therapy . In study , plan secondary analysis perform , compare treatment toxicity outcome IMRT proton . The data IMRT proton comparison trial use design future multi-center prospective trial determine randomize trial necessary . In study , treatment technique employ individual case determine treat physician ( ) , rather advanced technology available treat institution treatment sinonasal cancer . At Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , proton beam therapy use patient meet eligibility criterion . For institution proton available institution proton plan system optimize , IMRT exclusively use treatment sinonasal cancer . Patient tumor characteristic expect comparable IMRT- proton- institution</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects receive daily proton radiation treatment outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Center Massachusetts General Hospital . The subject may also receive concurrent standard chemotherapy every week radiation therapy . This chemotherapy consider standard treatment cancer do research purpose . In addition daily radiation treatment , subject follow test every week : review side effect ; physical exam , include weight , height , neurological exam vital sign ; blood test , subject also receive chemotherapy . Subjects follow 5 year completion study treatment . The first follow-up visit 6-8 week completion study treatment . Additional follow-up visit perform every 3 month first 2 year follow completion radiation every 6 month year 3-5 . At follow-up visit , subject receive physical exam , chest CT scan ( 1st follow-up visit least every 6 month ) , CT MRI tumor assessment ( 1st follow-up visit least every 6 month ) , quality-of-life questionnaire , hear test , neuro-ophthalmology test , neurocognitive test .</detailed_description>
