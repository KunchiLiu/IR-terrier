	<brief_summary>This study do find use botulinum toxin prior medium strength combination chemical peel ( Jessner 's peel follow 35 % Trichloroacetic acid peel ) improve appearance crow 's foot wrinkle compare chemical peel alone . Botulinum toxin type A purified substance , derive bacteria block muscular nerve signal . Jessner 's Peel , combination resorcinol ( 14g ) , salicylic acid ( 14g ) , lactic acid ( 85 % ) ethanol ( 95 % ) , superficial chemical peel . These two products/procedures FDA approve improve appearance facial wrinkle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wrinkling skin cause habitual facial expression , age , sun damage , smoking , poor hydration , various factor . There two major type wrinklesâ€”dynamic static . Dynamic wrinkle , due excessive muscle activity , usually face , tend disappear relax facial muscle . The common dynamic wrinkle frown line , forehead wrinkle , eye wrinkle ( crow 's foot ) . However , excessive muscle activity carry long , disappear completely relaxation , thus call static wrinkle . Static wrinkle form either chronic excessive muscle activity due effect age gravity , loss subcutaneous fat . Examples static wrinkle nasolabial fold , deep groove run side nose corner mouth .</detailed_description>
