	<detailed_description>Rationale Oxygen therapy may propose patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) nocturnal hypoxemia indication benefit oxygen therapy validate CF . Aim study main objective The aim study evaluate improvement nocturnal hypoxemia measurement nocturnal pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) 6 week nocturnal oxygen therapy stable patient CF . An improvement define nocturnal SpO2 &gt; 90 % whole night . Objectives secondary aim - Comparison subjective sleep quality oxygen therapy room air period 6 week mean 4 validated sleep questionnaire - Comparison quality life oxygen therapy room air period 6 week mean validated questionnaire CF patient ( CFQ ) . - Detection appearance increase nocturnal hypercapnia oxygen therapy room air period 6 week - Comparison possible arterial pulmonary hypertension oxygen therapy room air period 6 week mean echocardiography Study design This open , multicentre , prospective , randomise cross study , compare individual patient two period 6 week : one period nocturnal oxygen therapy one period room air , separate wash period 2 6 week . Inclusion criterion - Children ≥ 6 year adults ≥ 18 year CF stable state - With forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≤ 50 % predict value - Having pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) room air ≤ 90 % ≥ 10 % night and/or SpO2 ≤ 90 % ≥ 10 minute night - Any patient prior noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) stop NPPV least 15 day start study . - Written approval patient parent case pediatric patient - Patient French social security coverage Non-inclusion criterion - Patients respiratory exacerbation last 15 day - Patients NPPV long term oxygen therapy prior start study unable stop treatment - Impossibility medical examination - Pregnant patient breastfeed patient Study protocol The study propose patient V0 visit , correspond screen monitor show nocturnal SpO2 room air ≤ 90 % ≥ 10 % night and/or SpO2 ≤ 90 % ≥ 10 minute night . After period 2 30 day , write approval obtain routine visit . Thereafter , patient randomise receive either : 1. nocturnal oxygen therapy stable flow obtain nocturnal SpO2 &gt; 90 % ( Oxygen period ) continue routine long term treatment 2. routine long term treatment without nocturnal oxygen therapy ( Air period ) During Oxygen period , oxygen flow least 1.5 L/min . This flow may increase 2L/min case presence nocturnal period SpO2 ≤ 90 % . The two period Oxygen Air separate wash period 2 6 week rule long lasting effect nocturnal oxygen therapy . At end 2 period 6 week oxygen air , follow investigation perform : - A nocturnal evaluation gas exchange Sentec™ monitor ( measure SpO2 transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) ) objective sleep quality mean actigraphy - evaluation subjective sleep quality mean 4 validates sleep questionnaire - evaluation quality life validate CF questionnaire ( CFQ ) - spirometry blood gas room air - echocardiography Number subject Only 3 study evaluate benefit oxygen therapy nocturnal gas exchange one night one study evaluate benefit oxygen therapy period 26 month . This last study limit small number patient low compliance oxygen therapy . No study evaluate effect oxygen therapy 6 week period . This limit calculation number subject . As study cross study , number 30 analysable patient estimate sufficient evaluation primary outcome measure secondary outcomes . Because possibility premature withdrawal , plan include 50 patient . Total duration study : maximum 22.5 month Inclusion period : 18 month Duration participation one patient : maximum 4.5 month Statistical analysis final report : 3 month Number participate centre : 8 Estimation mean number patient include per centre : 3 patient / 3 month / centre Expected result The result present study help define criterion start long term oxygen therapy ass potential benefit treatment stable patient CF .</detailed_description>
