	<brief_summary>The timing quality sleep govern environmental physiologic factor . Environmental factor , especially ambient light impact circadian system alter timing structure sleep . Light exposure also acutely alter neural activation state impair sleep . These effect demonstrate mark sensitivity short-wavelength blue light maximal sensitivity 460-480 nm range . The alert effect blue light even persist least 3-4 hour light turn , disturb subsequent sleep . Avoiding deleterious effect light exposure prior sleep subsequent sleep would beneficial sleep quality potentially health . The investigator compare effect two light source , equate visual stimulus ( lux ) , multiple non-visual response light . The investigator compare 90 lux exposure commercially available Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) novel LED white light source deplete short-wavelength visible range ( Biological Illumination LCC , FL ) . In within-subject design , investigator test hypotheses exposure compare CFL 90 lux exposure 90 lux blue-depleted LED cause significantly : 1 . Less melatonin suppression melatonin onset bedtime ; 2 . Less subjective objective alerting response bedtime ; 3 . Less disruption nocturnal sleep structure quality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : test hypothesis exposure blue-depleted polychromatic light cause significantly less melatonin suppression melatonin onset bedtime compare exposure equal intensity polychromatic white ( non blue-depleted ) light . Specific Aim 2 : test hypothesis exposure blue-depleted polychromatic light cause significantly less subjective objective alerting response prior ( upto 3-hours ) bedtime compare exposure equal intensity polychromatic white ( non blue-depleted ) light . Specific Aim 3 : test hypothesis exposure blue-depleted polychromatic light cause significantly less disruption nocturnal sleep structure quality , particularly Slow Wave Sleep first NREM-REM sleep cycle , compare exposure equal intensity polychromatic white ( non blue-depleted ) light . Forty ( 40 ) subject ( balanced gender ) study 4-day inpatient time-isolation study . Our recruitment procedure provide applicant equal opportunity participate study regardless race , color , creed , national origin . We use online print advertisement recruit healthy men woman 18-30 year old . Each potential subject undergo extensive screening procedure prior participation study . The procedure begin telephone screen subject recruiter , ask series question preliminary screening questionnaire answer question potential subject may study . If original preliminary telephone screen questionnaire reveals ground exclusion , potential subject come office consent screen process , orientation , completion screening questionnaire , physical examination . The physical examination include blood urine test , EKG , physical exam physician . Candidates may also examine staff ophthalmologist/optometrist . All candidate exclude study medical and/or psychological reason inform give referral appropriate health care provider indicate . Written inform consent inpatient study obtain subject his/her study begin . Phone and/or email screening material potential subject , admit study , keep long study report closed IRB . The information store safe lock file room . After study report closed IRB , material destroy . The study length divide four segment : Segment I ( Home Baseline ) consist least 7 day , wrist activity light exposure may record use ambulatory record device , subject living home normal routine . During time , sleep-log regular sleep-wake schedule maintain outline . Segment II ( Inpatient Baseline ) subject report laboratory approximately four hour schedule wake time final home baseline day . Upon admission ( ADM ) , enter controlled-light single-patient suite ( BWH CCI Tower 9B ) bedroom bathroom . A nurse conduct admission interview include assessment recent current health vital sign . A urine sample collect toxicology drugs-of-abuse test pregnancy test female subject . Ambient background light level maintain regular indoor level ( ~90 lux ) facilitate admission procedure however , immediately follow admission , 8-h post habitual waketime , ambient light dim &lt; 3 lux . Six-hours prior habitual sleep subject start first constant posture ( CP ) protocol . The CP protocol restrict movement keep subject seat position order examine sensitive endocrine change otherwise easily confound postural alteration . The CP protocol occur Day 1 , 2 3 4 last 6-hours time . Following completion CP subject give 8-h sleep episode . Light level sleep ~0 lux . This segment study use baseline ( control ) measurement melatonin , alertness sleep . Segment III ( Light exposure ) begin morning Day 2 . Subjects randomized wake Day 2 one two different light condition entire 16-hour waking episode . The two experimental light condition detail . On Day 3 , subject complete another pre-bedtime dim light exposure session Day 1 Day 4 subject expose light condition entire 16-hour hour wake day . Segment IV ( Discharge ) Upon completion Segment III , subject discharge IPM hour habitual bedtime . Subjects expose first either ( ) polychromatic white light ( ii ) blue-depleted polychromatic light . The polychromatic white light generate use commercially available compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) ( regular bulb everyday use ) whereas blue-depleted polychromatic light generate use light emit diode ( LED ) lamps . The LED source electronically tune reduce relative strength blue portion visible spectrum ( blue-depleted ) compare polychromatic white light generate CFL . In comparison CFL source , LED source similar intensity ( lumen lux ) , visible light spectrum safety . Both type lamps house identical chamber lamps cover opaque material subject blind different type lamp . Multiple identical light device may place room generate ambient light uniform corneal illuminance . During first 10-hours 16-hour wake episode subject ambulatory room whereas next 6-hours 16-hour wake episode subject maintain constant posture receive uniform light exposure fix distance direction . Blood sample : Blood sample collect indwell intravenous ( IV ) catheter . Serial sample collect upto every 30-minutes start 8-hours prior habitual bedtime day admission completion study ( ~4 hour discharge ) . No 500 mL whole blood collect entire collection period . When blood sample draw , heparinized saline solution perfuse catheter keep IV patent . Blood assay melatonin and/or hormone , enzyme , metabolite associate metabolic , reproductive immune-response pathway . Urine Sample Collection : Urine collect approximately every three hour designate portion study subject awake . The urine volume measure , aliquot may save later hormonal , metabolite , electrolyte analysis . Saliva Sample Collection : Saliva sample collect frequently ( upto every hour ) ask subject spit small test tube , chew piece cotton . These sample use measurement hormone level . Polygraphic Recordings : Polygraphic record carry sleep episode wake episode subject CP protocol . Surface electrodes tap specific location subject 's face , head torso order allow record brain wave activity ( EEG ) , horizontal vertical eye movement ( EOG ) , heart rate , muscle activity ( EMG ) . The recording collect ambulatory digital recorder ( Vitaport , TEMEC Instruments ) . The digitized data use sleep wake spectral analysis sleep stage scoring . The signal sample 256 Hz , low-pass filter store 128 Hz flash RAM card , download hard-disk end record archive . Color Rendition Test : Subjects complete Farnsworth F100 Hue Tests three time study . Once standard regular indoor fluorescent light CFL LED light condition . The Farnsworth 100 Hue test one comprehensive color vision hue discrimination test . The subject provide 93 color disc three set 23 one set 24 objective select next closest color disc place sequence . Neurobehavioral Testing : We select battery computer-based test performance mood sensitive acute effect misalignment circadian phase sleep disruption performance ; ass whether certain critical behavioral function disrupt facilitated exposure light . Subjects perform various battery cognitive subjective task periodically throughout course daily wake episode . Each battery range 3-30 minute length . There opportunity break task .
