	<detailed_description>Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) use capture reproducible ocular morphology cross-sectional tissue measurement in-vivo rapid , non-invasive , non-contact manner . It displace ophthalmoscopy stereo photography clinical assessment documentation retinal microanatomy include thickness , cystoid structure , subretinal fluid retinal traction . ( 1 ) Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography ( SDOCT ) speed resolution require real-time noninvasive three-dimensional image critical pathology . While modern ophthalmic surgery benefit rapid advance instrumentation technique ( 2-6 ) , basic principle stereo zoom operate microscope change ( except increase automation ) since 1930 's . ( 7-9 ) The ability well resolve tissue microanatomy real-time micro-imaging would dramatic impact ophthalmic surgeon 's capability , foster development new surgical technique , potentially improve surgical outcome . Complementary microscope integrate OCT ( MIOCT ) testing , use commercial hand-held SDOCT instrument ( Bioptigen , Inc. ) pause anterior segment retinal surgery document surgical process . While handheld instrument Duke 's Generation 1 ( G1 ) MIOCT prototype demonstrate high-quality OCT image possible surgery , case control OCT scan location display real-time image data manage OCT system console , locate several foot surgeon . Thus , potential dramatic impact technology ophthalmic surgery constrain limited integration surgical environment . The primary technical goal project address issue novel advance OCT technology , automate track surgical instrument tool , fusion OCT control , image measurement seamless interface surgeon . This study facilitate future quality improvement process base intraoperative data match postoperative outcome . Intraoperative OCT feedback revolutionize communication surgical research , clinical communication , surgeon training continue education , provide measurable data regard disease pattern intraoperative response , novel instrument adjuvant use . This study prospectively examine surgical utility MIOCT retinal anterior segment surgery . A total 722 subject enrol 2 site , Duke Eye Center Cole Eye Institute . Of , 500 retina subject 222 anterior segment subject . There small number normal subject , undergo eye surgery , enrol portion study non-surgical study MIOCT system imaging , particularly Generation 2 ( G2 ) MIOCT . Rate recruitment : 460 retina subject enrol rate approximately 115 per year ( ~57 per year Duke Cole ) year 1-4 approximately 40 subject enrol year 5 ( add total 500 subject ) .</detailed_description>
