	<brief_summary>The study consist measurement antidepressant-induced excessive sweating treatment experimental medication , glycopyrrolate ( approved treat ulcer ) , add antidepressant . This open-label study ( placebo group concealment nature treatment ) last 8 week , include two week baseline measurement without treatment study medication follow six week treatment study medication . The study pilot study Dr. Rajnish Mago base hypothesis glycopyrrolate effective reduce severity excessive sweating cause antidepressant treatment , minimal side-effects .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Excessive Sweating Caused Antidepressants : Measurement Treatment With Glycopyrrolate ( AIDES-G )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sweating common bothersome adverse effect treatment antidepressant . Tricyclics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) clearly show cause sweat . Increased sweating report venlafaxine ( Pierre Guze , 2000 ) bupropion ( Feighner et al . 1984 ) well . It unclear extent tolerance develop antidepressant-induced sweating . It may continue problem even 6 month antidepressant ( e.g. , Mavissakalian et al. , 2002 ) . The prevalence sweat SSRIs estimate 7 % 19 % depend drug ( Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002 ) . According Physician 's Desk Reference , excessive sweating occur 3-11 % patient clinical trial SSRIs . Considering fairly high prevalence excessive sweating antidepressant use consequence patient distress treatment noncompliance , important intensive effort make understand phenomenon systematically study potential treatment . The mechanism antidepressant-induced sweat clearly elucidate generally accept treatment . Initially , reduction dose may attempt resolve antidepressant-induced sweating . However , reduction dose may always helpful ( Leeman , 1990 ; Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002 ) note presence sweat clear dose-related symptom . As well , reduce dose antidepressant may lead worsen depression therefore unrealistic alternative . Antiadrenergic drug like clonidine terazosin ( Feder , 1995 ; Mago Monti , 2007 ; Mago et al. , 2009 ) may effective treatment antidepressant-induced excessive sweat nervous system control sweat initially mediate adrenergic receptor . However , antiadrenergic treatment may associate decrease blood pressure patient , may lead dizziness , especially stand . Also , improvement excessive sweating may complete . Therefore , additional approach need . Sweat gland innervate nerve fiber release acetylcholine . Anticholinergic medication could use potential treatment excessive sweating . In case report , anticholinergic drug benztropine successfully use treat antidepressant-induced excessive sweating ( Garber Gregory , 1997 ; Feder Guze , 2000 ) . However , confirm clinical trial . Also , benztropine readily cross blood-brain barrier ; therefore , addition desire effect peripherally sweat gland , tend cause cognitive side effect central effect . Glycopyrrolate anticholinergic medication prefer variety clinical us cross blood-brain barrier great extent . It use many year anesthesiologists dry secretion surgical procedure . In case series base chart review ( Tran et al. , 2009 ) , find effective antidepressant-induced excessive sweating .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 year old 2 . Presence excessive sweat selfreport 3 . Within 2 month initiation antidepressant increase dose , clear substantial increase sweating explain undue external warmth , exercise , reason . If treatment antidepressant interrupt , persist 6 week interruption 4 . Treatment antidepressant deem clinically necessary due substantial benefit antidepressant cause excessive sweating , failure respond tolerate alternative antidepressant 5 . Decrease dose antidepressant either clinically viable due benefit obtain current dose OR decrease dose antidepressant tried effective . 6 . Excessive sweating persist least 4 week prior baseline assessment 7 . The excessive sweating rat patient least moderately bothersome . 8 . Episodes excessive sweat occur least twice week last 4 week 9 . Use effective contraception ( e.g. , sterilization , oral contraceptive , condom spermicide , etc ) 1 . Presence another known disease could potentially cause excessive sweat 2 . Failure respond past anticholinergic treatment excessive sweating 3 . Previous allergic reaction glycopyrrolate 4 .
