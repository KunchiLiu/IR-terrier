	<brief_title>China Clinical Trial Therapeutic MR-HIFU Ablation Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study confirm safety effectiveness Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) ablate uterine tissue associate symptomatic leiomyoma . The importance therapy offer non-invasive , uterine spar procedure treatment uterine fibroid pre- peri- menopausal woman . MR-HIFU us ultrasound heat thermally ablate fibroid tissue . The MRI system identifies ultrasound path monitor heat rise fibroid tissue . The goal study show treatment safety effectiveness Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU device uterine fibroid market approval Chinese market . MR-HIFU perform 100 patient pass inclusion/exclusion criterion . Safety , quality life , image endpoint evaluate study patient baseline 6 month post-treatment . All patient follow 12 month post-treatment safety .</detailed_description>
