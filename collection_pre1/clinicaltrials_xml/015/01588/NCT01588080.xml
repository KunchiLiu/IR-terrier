	<brief_summary>When baby bear premature , often need help breathing . The equipment use help breathe comfortable sometimes need put specialized breathing machine tube lung . The breathing machine ventilator damage newborn 's lungs damage occur longer newborn stay ventilator lead chronic lung disease later live . A new device call neurally adjust ventilatory assist NAVA available investigator believe may comfortable premature newborn may help baby come breathe support sooner . When use device , baby may need put ventilator avoid lung damage associate breathe tube ventilator . The objective pilot study compare new breathing device call NAVA , equipment currently use , call SiPAP , support premature newborn 's breathing birth without breathe tube . The investigator hope show new technology , premature newborn difficult time breathing , come breathe support sooner compare breathe machine currently use . The hypothesis propose study improve synchrony noninvasive NAVA decrease time spend noninvasive ventilation avoid intubation .</brief_summary>
