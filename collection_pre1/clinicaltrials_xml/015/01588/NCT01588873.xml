	<detailed_description>The study population consist woman reproductive age PCOS , wish pregnancy contraindication hormonal contraceptive . The volunteer subject recruit hospital 's patient file PCOS ( IC diagnosis E.28.2 ) . Methods Sample size Our previous study compare metabolic effect preparation ( Mercilon Nuvaring ) young healthy woman show significant decrease 1.65 ( SD 1.68 ) Matsuda index 9 week treatment oral contraceptive pill . Power analysis indicate 14 woman would need group reveal similar significant decrease serum level Matsuda index . To allow drop-outs ( estimate high 20-30 % ) , plan sample size 21 group . Medication Forty woman randomise either pill ( n=21 ) ring ( n=21 ) group . The OC contraceptive ring use nine week period . Every period follow break one week . In pill group subject start pill first day follicular phase cycle baseline examination continue nonstop nine week , i.e . third package run . This follow one week ' break . The ring replace every three week treatment continue nine week one week break follow . In group cycle repeat six time result 59 week treatment . The used preparation : Vaginal ring , depotproduct : ethinylestradiol 2.7 mg ( 0,015 mg/day ) etonogestrel 11.7 mg ( 0,120 mg/day ) contraceptive pill , ethinylestradiol tabl 20 µg , desogestrel 150 µg . Ultrasonography An ultrasonography ovary perform baseline support diagnosis PCOS exclude androgen release tumor . Blood sample Blood sample hormonal metabolic assessment take every appointment . Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) The glucose metabolism tolerance measure oral glucose tolerance test , subject take dose 75 gram glucose mixed 300ml water ten hour fast . The blood sample take test 30 , 60 120 minute glucose intake . The schedule A wash-out period least 2 month use previous hormonal contraceptive require . At baseline examination perform 1st 5th day menstruation cycle begin contraception . The second appointment occur 9th pill/ring week , third 29th week , fourth 59th week last appointment one month stop contraception . Blood sample take blood pressure measure every appointment , OGTT perform every appointment except 29th week . Serum analyse All blood sample collect morning 07 10 overnight fast follicular phase ( cycle day 1-4 ) time case amenorrhea . All screening analysis analyse local hospital . Seven test-tubes whole blood collect patient . Six tube centrifuge within 30 minute , serum fill eight ( 8 ) tube least 2 ml serum , immediately frozen -70 º C. In addition , plasma one tube frozen -70 º C least 2 tube least 2ml plasma . Every tube mark randomisation number , initial , date birth time . Fasting plasma glucose HbA1c analyse every appointment local hospital . Planned analyse Hormonal , metabolic inflammatory parameter . Ethical question possible harmful effect Participating research completely voluntary . When take blood sample , risk practically restrict problem cause stitch needle . The possible adverse effect use contraceptive observe every appointment . Problems report FIMEA ( Finnish Medical Association ) local ethical committee , necessary . A continuous dosing use study , routine treatment . Uninterrupted dose contraceptive pill use several study difference contraceptive effect compare routine dosing report . Instead , menstruation come less frequently user-friendly . Continuous dosing may cause slightly swell extra leakage . After study treatment subject continue follow standard practice . All information require kept locked cupboard , dispose ten year study end . Information computer require username password . Analysing result significance Blood sample analyze Oulu University Hospital laboratory Clinical Chemistry , fulfill international quality criterion . The result analyze use SPSS-program . During research Oulu University statistics-professional consult help statistical analysis . Significance study : This study allow clarify whether oral transvaginal contraceptive recommend particular group woman , example woman increase metabolic risk . It also clarify whether unfavourable effect combine contraceptive decrease long term use . Concealment dispose register The information study data keep computer require username password . All write information keep room lock cupboard . The register dispose follow ethical committee 's instruction later end 2027 . Schedule The study begin spring 2012 estimate continue December 2018 . Funding The study fund Sigrid Juselius organization Kevo-fund Department Obstetrics Gynaecology Oulu University Hospital . Changes plan Every possible change study design report local Ethical Committee .</detailed_description>
