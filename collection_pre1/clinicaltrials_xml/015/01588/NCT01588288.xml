	<brief_summary>The investigator dose galectin 3 plasma water rinse needle aspiration biopsy patient thyroid nodule . The investigator aim show preoperative dosage galectin 3 could provide good diagnosis malignant versus benign thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Galectin 3 Dosage Diagnosis Nodular Multinodular Goiter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endogenous cell-surface galectins recently gain interest antigenic determinant vary tumor tissue . They also use potential target antitumor therapy couple cytotoxic molecule radioisotopes either carbohydrate residue , antibody antigalectines . In addition , plasma level dosage galectin 3 seem possible provide diagnostic help thyroid lesion monitor squamous cell head neck . In study thyroid tumor , sensitivity [ Se ] specificity [ Sp ] plasma level poor ( 70 % ) , study conduct low heterogeneous recruitment ( 70 patient ) . The inclusion great number patient good selection would better inform u quality diagnostic assay . An additional argument would dosage galectins water rinse needle aspiration biopsy . This study never make far evidence predict sensitivity specificity . The advantage galectin `` dilute '' would case assay do blood . Moreover , would select candidate dosage nodule , ie whose size would impose , cancer , resort surgical treatment extensive originally plan . Indeed , compare preoperative already exist meter `` interesting '' dosage would diagnose : - good reliability ( Se Sp &gt; 80 % ) - cancer require additional treatment ( i.e . surgical revision achieve total thyroidectomy , accompany lymph node dissection ) result high risk morbidity reoperation . The investigator therefore believe preoperative galectin 3 dosage plasma puncture water rinse could strong argument point neoplastic full initial gesture single surgical step , gesture much less risky expensive . In study , patient benefit routine monitoring thyroid nodule accord current recommendation . For surgical patient , information intervention collect know final histological diagnosis . Galectin 3 measure preoperatively : - plasma - water rinse FNA . The diagnostic characteristic assay , sensitivity specificity establish relative reference method histological analysis specimen ( report ) assert existence vesicular lineage tumor , benign ( adenoma ) malignant ( papillary follicular ) .</detailed_description>
