	<detailed_description>Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) treat various combination radiation chemotherapy . Docetaxel cisplatin combine Phase II trial recurrent metastatic head neck cancer encourage result . Induction therapy docetaxel/cisplatin follow chemoradiotherapy investigate randomized Phase II study nasopharyngeal cancer show superior PFS OS comparison chemoradiation alone . Cetuximab chimerized EGFR monoclonal antibody produce positive result Phase III trial combination either radiation locally advanced disease chemotherapy metastatic disease . Upregulation vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) associate cetuximab resistance . Bevacizumab , anti-VEGF antibody currently investigate SCCHN promising result . The investigator previously show cisplatin , docetaxel cetuximab ( TPE ) follow radiotherapy , cisplatin cetuximab ( XPE ) feasible highly efficacious locally advanced SCCHN ( Argiris , A. et al.JCO 2011 ) . In Phase II study investigator evaluate addition bevacizumab induction therapy TPE ( TPE-A ) subsequent XPE ( XPE-A ) . Specific aim : To evaluate rate complete response induction therapy ( primary endpoint ) progression-free survival , overall survival objective response rate . Also , investigator plan investigate panel EGFR angiogenesis biomarkers pre- post- treatment tumor biopsy . Finally , investigator evaluate associate treatment toxicity quality life . Subject population : The investigator enroll patient previously untreated locally advanced SCCHN ( see detail eligibility criterion ) . Treatment plan : Induction therapy consist 3 cycle bevacizumab 15mg/kg day 1 , docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1 , load dose cetuximab 400mg/m2 cycle 1 , day 1 , 250 mg/m2 subsequent administration ( Day 8 15 cycle 1 day 1,8,15 cycle 2 3 ) , cisplatin 75mg/m2 day 1 , docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1 , repeat every 21 day . After 3 cycle induction therapy , patient receive standard radiation 70-74 Gy/ 200 cGy/ daily , 5 days/ week concurrent weekly cisplatin 30mg/m2 , cetuximab 250mg/m2 bevacizumab 15mg/kg every 3 week x 3 . There optional surgery non-responders primary ( stable disease ) TPE-A . Statistical design sample size : Phase II , two-stage study complete response rate induction therapy primary endpoint . The sample size 33 patient .</detailed_description>

Prior entry study resectability alternative treatment option patient determine team compose Ear , Nose , Throat Surgeon , Radiation Oncologist Medical Oncologist . Stage determination , optimal local treatment , time accord protocol determine evaluation . The unequivocal demonstration distant metastasis ( M1 ) confers ineligibility . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell poorly differentiate carcinoma , WHO type IIII nasopharynx . Unidimensionally measurable disease require ( RECIST 1.1 ) . No prior chemotherapy , biologic/molecular target therapy ( include prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway ) , radiotherapy head neck cancer .

Any nonbiopsy procedure must take place &gt; 4 week &lt; 3 month initiate protocol treatment . ECOG performance status 01 . Age 18 year old . Informed consent must obtain patient prior begin therapy . Patients ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . All patient tumor tissue test HPV ( situ hybridization and/or p16 stain immunohistochemistry ) , result must know prior study entry , consent available archival tumor sample , unstained slide block previous diagnostic therapeutic procedure submit correlative study , include assessment target molecule EGFR , VEGF relate biomarkers . Also , patient must agree submit blood sample correlative study least baseline .

Urine dipstick must &lt; 01+ within 2 week ( 14 day ) randomization . If urine dipstick result &gt; 1+ , calculation Urine Protein Creatinine ( UPC ) ratio require . Patients must UPC ratio &lt; 1.0 participate study . NOTE : UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24urine protein excretion UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1gm . UPC ratio calculate use one follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] protein creatinine report mg/DI [ ( urine protein ) × 0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] urine creatinine report mmol/L Patients prior history squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer must curatively treat . Patients history prior malignancy must treat curative intent must remain diseasefree 3 year post diagnosis . Patients may receive investigational agent .
