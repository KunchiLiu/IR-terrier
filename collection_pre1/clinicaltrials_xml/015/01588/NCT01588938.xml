	<brief_summary>This prospective study MAMC evaluate utility rigid pelvic external immobilization compare limited immobilization use novel real-time localization system prostate . The sample population include patient referred radiation oncology service facility definitive treatment prostate cancer . The study enroll 20 subject MAMC evaluate data 860 radiation therapy fraction . Subjects Beacon® Transponders implant prostate precisely localize position organ radiation therapy . They randomize rigid pelvic immobilization use Vac-Lok® system limited immobilization band around patient 's foot . They undergo radiation therapy plan standard planning target margin . The Calypso® 4D Localization System monitor , real time , position prostate target adjust radiation treatment require ensure accurate treatment prostate gland . The time , number , extent adjustment record analysis . Hypothesis : 1 . When treat prostate , treatment rigid pelvic immobilization necessary use real-time , state-of-the-art motion track prostate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medical application : This study seek determine utility rigid external pelvic immobilization patient set use real-time , state-of-the-art motion track prostate . External immobilization device criticize expensive , uncomfortable , time-consuming make , occupy lot space treatment area , create difficulty time CT simulation , challenge obese patient obscure skin mark help confirm patient set . Omitting device ( find unnecessary ) would potentially decrease treatment cost , improve patient comfort treatment , reduce overall treatment time . In high risk patient , gain well understanding lymph node position relative Calypso immobilization may allow decrease PTV margin therefore decrease normal tissue irradiate radiation therapy . Objective ( ) investigation : This study look efficacy external pelvic immobilization definitive radiation therapy prostate cancer use unique organ track system . A . Primary Objective : To determine rigid external pelvic immobilization demonstrate reduction position error . This assess determine median , mean range shift perform 3 dimension part initial isocenter set-up treatment use Calypso system . B . Secondary Objectives : The study determine simulation time , set time , treatment time , total time number treatment intervention ( repositioning/pausing ) cause organ/target motion beyond plan target volume ( PTV ) margin use real time localization . In subset high-risk patient , study ass position lymph node target use combination rigid external pelvic immobilization Calypso system .</detailed_description>
