	<detailed_description>Background : In healthy subject , liver extract approximately 50 % insulin . Therefore insulin give subcutaneously result relative insulin deficiency portal circulation liver , relative insulin excess peripheral tissue . In comparison , normal physiological delivery insulin pancreas portal circulation , result markedly higher hepatic insulin exposure . The importance hepatic insulin exposure GH induce IGF-I synthesis come study demonstrate circulate IGF-I level normalize direct portal insulin infusion ( 1 ) nearly normalize intra-peritoneal insulin delivery ( 2 ) . Approximately 80 % circulate IGF-I liver derive . Whether GH induction IGF-I production tissue fat , muscle growth plate also insulin dependent study human . While locally produce IGF-I important linear growth , circulate IGF-I essential insulin sensitivity ( 3 ) . Portal insulin deficiency result uncouple GH induce IGF-I synthesis subnormal circulate IGF-I level T1DM child conventional therapy ( 4 ) . In newly diagnose T1DM subcutaneous insulin treatment increase circulate IGF-I ( 5 ) . The beneficial effect 12 week adjuvant IGF-I treatment metabolic control demonstrate conventionally insulin treat T1DM adolescent ( 6 ) . There also strong evidence role IGF-I pathogenesis diabetic kidney disease , atherosclerosis proliferative retinopathy ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Interestingly , recent report suggest important role IGF-I stimulate beta cell regeneration ( 10 ) . Thus role improvement IGF-I prolong endogenous insulin secretion early phase T1DM disease appear promise . The Investigators previously develop microdialysis approach measure local IGF-I protein level human muscle tissue . The Investigators study able show exercise increase local IGF-I level . ( 11 , 12 ) However , analysis concern tissue-specific glucose metabolism perform . The Investigators hypothesis low circulate IGF-I compensatory hyper-secretion GH , presence peripheral insulin excess , result increase local IGF-I expression explain deterioration metabolic control increase risk microvascular complication . In conclusion , correction imbalance circulate tissue-specific level IGF-I could lead good early metabolic control prevention early diabetic complication type 1 diabetic ( T1DM ) patient . Study Design : This placebo control crossover study effect sc IGF-1 ( Increlex ) administration glucose infusion rate ( whole body glucose utilization ) interstitial muscle IGF-1 concentration euglycemic clamp condition T1DM adolescent young adult ( 18-23 age ) . Each subject study twice randomize receive IGF-1 ( 120 μg/ kg , Increlex® , Ipsen ) placebo . Glucose control optimize CSII ( Continuous Subcutaneus Insulin Infusion ) 2 day subject study overnight fast use constant low rate insulin infusion block hepatic glucose production . After single s.c. bolus IGF-1 , effect IGF-1 peripheral glucose disposal rate assess base rate variable glucose infusion . Local muscle IGF-1 measure microdialysis related peripheral glucose disposal rate ( mainly determine muscle glucose uptake ) . Patients T1DM study several reason : 1 ) They target group long term treatment , 2 ) They IGF-I deficient thus likely significant effect sc IGF-I injection , 3 ) muscle level may may low . The following assessment perform : - Height &amp; Weight - Glucose utilization rate ( normoinsulinemic , euglycemic clamp ) - Blood parameter : P-glucose , Growth Hormone ( GH ) , IGF-1 , Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins 1-3 ( IGFBP1-3 ) Glucagon - Microdialysis IGF-1</detailed_description>
