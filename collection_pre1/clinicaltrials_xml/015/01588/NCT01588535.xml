Patient demonstrate clinical sign anemia . The absolute amount deoxygenate abnormal hemoglobin ( rather percentage ) require cyanosis clinically evident . Patients moderatetosevere anemia may appear cyanotic , even elevate percentage deoxygenate abnormal hemoglobin . Patient congenital ( i.e. , hereditary ) methemoglobinemia . Patient recent history acute gastroenteritis within 14 day prior study entry . An association methemoglobinemia acute gastroenteritis infant note several study may due acidosis stool bicarbonate loss impair already immature function methemoglobin reductase system young patient .</criteria>
