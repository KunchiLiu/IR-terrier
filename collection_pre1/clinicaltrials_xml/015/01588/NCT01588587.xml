	<brief_summary>Recently , DPP-IV inhibitor use novel way augment incretin system one newest class medication treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Since DPP-IV inhibitor first use , 5 year pass USA . However , major side effect include occurrence cancer . The main mechanism DPP-IV inhibitor due suppress function DPP-IV activity . As know suppressed DPP-IV activity marker early diagnosis cancer , reason disassociation clear . Activation receptor advance glycation endproduct ( AGE ) relate sideration cancer . Meanwhile , DPP-IV inhibitor may relate inhibit activation receptor AGE ( RAGE ) . Therefore , DPP-IV inhibitor may work cancer protective agent diabetes block AGE-RAGE axis . However , demonstrate DPP-IV inhibitor side effect occurrence cancer via block activation AGE-RAGE . The investigator examine effect DPP-IV inhibitor frequency cancer underlie mechanism use AGE RAGE 5 year administration DPP-IV inhibitor Japanese patient T2DM .</brief_summary>
