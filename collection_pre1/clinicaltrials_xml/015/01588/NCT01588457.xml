	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two mood stabilizer ( drug help steady/stabilize mood patient bipolar disorder ( BD ) ) , lithium divalproex , effective patient bipolar disorder 26 week . The study also compare lithium divalproex use alone versus lithium divalproex use quetiapine versus lithium divalproex use lamotrigine effective symptom depression develop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Multiple Assignment Treatment Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open method advancement study randomize BD patient clinically significant symptom treatment one two mood stabilizer ( MS ) , lithium [ LI ] divalproex [ DV ] . Those develop protocol define depression randomize MS alone , MS + quetiapine [ QT ] MS + lamotrigine [ LM ] . A SMART strategy employ rule add new treatment base patient 's current illness state response trial , mimic adaptive nature treatment selection occur clinical setting , control way allow application causal inference . By use early index response dynamically alter treatment decision improve outcome , SMART eliminate unmeasured confounders associate treatment decision randomize , occur data mining exercise non-randomized decision study randomize one variable baseline . This sequential adaptive design represent methodological innovation bipolar trial history particular implication effectiveness study . Specific Aim A.1 : Assess feasibility SMART design conduct effectiveness study 26 week patient BD . Aim A.2 Compare effectiveness LI DV primary component treatment BD 26 week . Aim A.3 : Assess effectiveness MS + QT MS + LM versus MS subject develop depression . A4 . Exploratory Aims : 1.Determine effect ethnicity , language facility , education stress moderator treatment outcomes ; 2 . Explore use novel statistical methodology informatively characterize illness trajectory response intervention . In aggregate aim also clarify whether SMART confirm result provide traditional , single point randomize control trial ( RCTs ) .</detailed_description>
