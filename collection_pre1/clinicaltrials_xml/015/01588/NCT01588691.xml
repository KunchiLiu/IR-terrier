	<detailed_description>The subject complete participation three group evaluate different program parameter . After surgery , subject randomize Group A Group B . Group C complete middle follow alternate A/B Group . Crossover occur 3 week interval subject complete three group . During period , subject receive subject programmer enable activate `` '' position adjust amplitude within prescribed range . After subject complete three pre-defined group select effective comfortable set continuation study . The pulse width frequency parameter set optimal setting identify subject . Amplitude set level produce comfortable paresthesia subject . Subjects return clinic programming change post system internalization 3 week , 6 week , 9 week .
