	<detailed_description>This dose escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) overall safety tolerability topical compound 31543 ( Calcitriol ) patient metastatic recurrent cancer undergo chemotherapy taxane-based regimen . A standard 3+3 dose escalation design employ 3-6 patient dose level . Eligible patient ≥18 year age schedule receive taxane-based regimen treatment break per physician 's discretion , start apply topical solution twice day cohort dose level two week 7 day ± 2 day prior initiation chemotherapy continue twice daily 3 month termination chemotherapy treatment . If topical calcitriol find effective preventing and/or diminish taxane chemotherapy-induced alopecia determine photographic assessment patient self-assessments , patient allow continue topical application duration chemotherapy treatment , assume dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) relate topical agent intolerable side effect observe . Toxicity topical compound 31543 ( calcitriol ) assess weekly basis first 28 day topical treatment subsequently every four week study clinician , either physician nurse . For purpose pharmacokinetic study ( PKs ) , blood sample collect Day 1 topical treatment follow time point : pre-dose , 2 hr ( ±30 minute ) , 4 hr ( ±30 minute ) , 8 hr ( ±1 hr post dose ) single application morning Day 1 . The second application drug product apply 10-14 hrs initial application 8 hr PK sample . Thereafter , topical application frequency twice daily , morning night . Subsequently , PK sample take 12 hr ( ±2 hr ) last dose 28-day treatment , first application Day 1 next 28-day treatment cycle . This schedule continue three consecutive 28-day topical treatment cycle . ( PKs draw Weeks 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 . In addition , patient still study , PK also draw Week 54 . ) As secondary objective , potential efficacy topical calcitriol evaluate photographic assessment . Photographic assessment perform use Canon digital camera system ensure standardization uniformity among enrolled patient . The follow five view obtain photographic assessment : bilateral side head/scalp view , front head/face view , back head/scalp view , top head/scalp view.Additionally , close-up photograph take time point . They include mid-pattern scalp superior view vertex view hair part center comb away center part . Photographs standardize lighting , camera angle , position participant 's head.These assessment perform follow time point : baseline , Weeks 7 , 15 , 27 , 54 . Photographs patient cohort represent baseline , treatment Weeks 7 15 present blind study PI dermatologist , Mario Lacouture , least 3 patient complete 15 week treatment . Photographs also take Week 27 Week 54 study include final photographic assessment secondary information . In addition , patient ask maintain application log throughout treatment ensure compliance . Additionally patient maintain medication application diary self-assessment diary . The medication application diary collect daily application detail medication . This include application date time , chemotherapy cycle , whether medication apply ( reason medication apply ) . The self-assessment diary require assessment hair thickness , hair fullness , hair breakage , hair cosmetic quality ( ease styling , etc . ) analog 10 point scale ass patient-reported efficacy . The PI clinical assessment baseline , Weeks 7 15 photograph use , together patient diary information , primary assessment alopecia . The study expect take place period approximately 12 month , include screening period .</detailed_description>

Patients manage bisphosphonates calciumlowering therapy 3 month great prior start trial demonstrate evidence stability calcium metabolism would consider eligible participation trial . Has history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year study enrollment determine investigator . Patients elect shave scalp hair prior initiation chemotherapy plan chemotherapy treatment . Any dermatological condition opinion investigator affect absorption study medication , e.g . Atopic Dermatitis , etc .
