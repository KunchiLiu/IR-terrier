	<brief_title>Comparison Pulmonary Compliance Between Curosurf Survanta Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature newborn infant may impair lung function result prematurity . When occurs , newborn show poor oxygen carbon dioxide exchange difficulty breathe . The reason symptom due part lack special chemical lung , call phospholipid surfactant . The lack special chemical cause baby lung difficult ventilate . Treatment condition require place artificial airway ( endotracheal tube ) baby windpipe ( intubation ) use breathe machine ( ventilator ) . In addition , physician frequently give special chemical ( phospholipid ) childs airway . There several different type phospholipid available treatment newborn limit amount study do examine difference ability ventilate various type surfactant . The investigator propose examine immediate change ability ventilate ( dynamic compliance ) specific time interval administration either type surfactant ; Curosurf Survanta .</detailed_description>
