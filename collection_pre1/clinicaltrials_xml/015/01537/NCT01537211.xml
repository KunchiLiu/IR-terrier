	<brief_summary>In old adult , poor circulation low extremity lead serious health complication include limb loss . In addition , individual dysvascular disease also suffer co-morbidities like diabetes , coronary cerebrovascular disease . An individual transfemoral ( TF ) amputation usually fit prosthetic limb assist function , include prosthetic knee prosthetic foot . Currently , dysvascular amputee give prosthetic knee base basic expectation functionally stable . This consideration address high level function like walk multiple speed uneven ground . Also , dysvascular amputee able counteract co-morbidities active lifestyle . Walking less energy efficient ; traditional prosthesis may cause early onset fatigue induce fear fall . Newer microprocessor knee enable patient transfemoral amputation walk different surface multiple cadence well control swing stance phase gait . The impact functional difference prosthesis clear require additional investigation clarify choice appropriate functional prosthesis . The purpose study compare functional outcome traditional mechanical knee versus microprocessor knee ( C-leg ) transfemoral amputee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In old adult , poor circulation low extremity dysvascular disease lead serious health complication . In addition , individual also suffer serious co-morbidities like diabetes coronary cerebrovascular disease . Circulatory dysfunction dysvascular disease major cause amputation United States ( www.amputee-coalition.orf/fact_sheet/amp_stats_cause.html ) . Increasing sedentary lifestyle lead increase rate diabetes significantly contribute increased number amputation recent year . The risk amputation diabetic individual 25 time higher non-diabetic population . The level amputation appropriate individual depend extent damage his/her tissue . Common amputation low extremity dysvascular population include transtibial transfemoral amputation . The individual transtibial knee amputation , fit prosthetic foot assist functional ambulation , person transfemoral amputation require prosthetic foot knee ambulatory purpose . Currently dysvascular amputee give prosthesis base goal return basic level function focus primarily stability . They consider low function walker expect use slow constant walk speed ambulate around home consider traditional community ambulators . Therefore , traditionally give standard mechanical knee consider safe , provide ability simple single speed house-hold task . While criterion return patient function basic Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) walk single cadence , empower patient counteract previously exist co-morbidities . Dysvascular amputee tend less active predisposing sedentary lifestyle exacerbate risk factor . Their prosthesis make energy inefficient use energy ADLs functional walking . This cause early onset fatigue , induces anxiety fear fall . Further , often depressed , lose motivation curtail community interaction . This raise question dysvascular amputee functionally limited prosthesis traditionally give . More recently , technology use assist return function amputee population . Microprocessor ( MP ) control knee among technological innovation apply prosthesis return amputee basic function , also view return high possible function . Over year , clinical use show traditional knee provide ability complete ADLs basic function like sit - stand . However , activity like negotiate stairs/steps , walk uneven ground self-correction tripping ; function reintegrate amputee unlimited community ambulation social reintegration require prosthetics advanced functionality . The Otto Bock C-leg MP knee allow patient great level control swing stance phase gait . This enable TF amputee adjust requirement gait dynamic walking like change speed walking , go stairs incline , walk grass uneven surface cross obstacle . The C-leg traditionally give patient begin post-amputation rehabilitation high level , expensive traditionally mechanical knee . In contrary however , European study define health outcome term quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) , indicate C-leg show QALY gain â‚¬3218 per patient , make still financial viable keep mind price tag.. The purpose study compare traditional mechanical knee microprocessor knee ( C-leg ) dysvascular population . The study specifically evaluate potential microprocessor knee improve quality life dysvascular transfemoral amputee . This include identify C-leg increase activity level classify high level Medicare classification K2 ( low level ambulators ) K3 ( proficient ambulators ) , along increase social interaction community .</detailed_description>
