	<brief_summary>Innovative advance rehabilitation technology create split-belt treadmill capable provide much need intervention aim limiting mobility disability . When desynchronize , split-belt treadmill impose demand leg central nervous system must adapt challenge . Based preliminary data lab utilizing split-belt treadmill , investigator hypothesize intervention challenge locomotor process require safe , efficient gait concurrently provide aerobic stimulus produce favorable change physical function older adult risk mobility disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For pilot study investigator enroll 20 sedentary old adult risk disability ( usual gait speed ≤ 1.0 m/s ) . Participants assign one two 12-week intervention . Therefore final training pool consist 10 split-belt participant 10 traditional treadmill participant . Aim 1 test hypothesis compare traditional treadmill intervention split-belt treadmill intervention result improved mobility , measure 400 meter walk time , well self report physical function/disability measure Pepper Assessment Tool Disability . Aim 2 test hypothesis compare traditional treadmill intervention split-belt treadmill intervention result improve gait variability . To date , experimental study evaluate proposition control trial test effect split-belt training old adult risk disability .</detailed_description>
