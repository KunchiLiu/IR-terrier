	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine wound elevated protease activity ( EPA ) treat targeted intervention protease modulate therapy improve clinical economic outcome . It hypothesize protease modulate dressing may provide significantly well clinical outcome EPA wound current standard care . Wounds EPA determine use new POC diagnostic test , WOUNDCHEK™ Protease Status , efficacy PROMOGRAN® , protease modulate therapy determine standard care ( moist wound heal compression ) VLU wound elevate EPA low protease activity wound .</detailed_description>
