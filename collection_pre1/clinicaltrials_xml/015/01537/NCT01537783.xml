	<brief_summary>In study , investigator enroll patient present emergency department abscesses study . The patient randomly select either standard care , include standard drainage abscess usually follow-up visit recheck wound , standard care plus instruction use topical scrub soap call chlorhexidine day five day twice daily application topical antibiotic ointment call mupirocin nasal passages five day . The investigator call back patient 7 day , 14 day ( treatment arm ) , 3 month 6 month , ask recurrence abscess formation . The study hypothesis patient undergone decontamination protocol few subsequent infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Staphylococcus Eradication Protocol Patients Who Present ED With Cutaneous Abscess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many people hear resistant `` superbug '' cause worrisome infection people around world . One bacteria call Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . Staph aureus pathogen lead skin infection , new strain resistant standard antibiotic treatment physician use render ( usually penicillin-based ) . In addition , community-acquired strain MRSA associate creation painful boil , abscess , require patient come painful incision drainage procedure ED . Soft tissue infection attributable MRSA present ED ambulatory setting increase alarm rate - 32.1 48.1 visit per 1000 population compare data National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 1997 2005 . It believe MRSA contract close contact people infection , live skin nasal passage . For people recurrent skin infection , infectious disease expert sometimes recommend `` eradication '' `` decolonization '' protocol try kill MRSA . These protocol often involve ) topical scrub remove MRSA skin , b ) nasal antibiotic ointment remove MRSA nasal passage , occasionally c ) oral antibiotic . This procedure usually recommend see infectious disease specialist , knowledge , never attempt emergency department patient . Therefore , study , investigator enroll patient present emergency department abscesses study . The patient randomly select either standard care , include standard drainage abscess usually follow-up visit recheck wound , standard care plus instruction use topical scrub soap call chlorhexidine day five day twice daily application topical antibiotic ointment call mupirocin nasal passages five day . The investigator call back patient 7 day , 14 day ( treatment arm ) , 3 month 6 month , ask recurrence abscess formation . The study hypothesis patient undergone decontamination protocol few subsequent infection . Using conservative estimate proportion recurrence control group 50 % , sample size 50 ( 25 subject group ) provide investigator 80 % power detect statistically significant difference proportion patient recurrence treatment control group proportion treatment group recurrent infection 15 % . If 60 % control group experience recurrent infection , study 80 % power detect statistically significant difference recurrence observe 23 % treatment group . If hypothesis true , could greatly impact care patient present ED abscess , hopefully reduce morbidity associate recurrent abscess , include lose work need return future painful incision drainage procedure .</detailed_description>
