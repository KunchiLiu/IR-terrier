	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan bone marrow start standard chemotherapy predict complete remission leukemia patient therapy . This type MRI scan , call dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) , measure bone marrow blood flow . For patient achieve complete remission status initial therapy treat additional therapy , investigator also interested determine second MRI exam additional therapy predict complete remission . If successfully test , MRI exam may use future help early identification patient unlikely respond standard chemotherapy . This allow personalize therapeutic plan develop patient early stage prevent expose toxic ineffective therapy .</brief_summary>
