	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : FOUR score well predictor outcome ( hospital mortality functional outcome discharge ) GCS child 5- 18 year age admit pediatric ward/ ICU non-traumatic impaired consciousness . The assessment comatose patient important part critical care . The assessment level coma rely clinical score . The Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) , remain commonly use score system alter state consciousness . Despite widespread use , number limitation identify GCS like inability ass verbal score intubated patient non-inclusion vital brainstem function . The FOUR ( Full Outline UnResponsiveness ) score , coma scale consist four component ( eye response , motor response , brainstem reflex , respiration pattern ) recently propose investigator Mayo Clinic.keeping view limitation GCS , study plan compare new FOUR score GCS predictor mortality poor functional outcome hospital discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study carry May 2009 June 2010 Department Pediatrics , All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi . This study approve institutional ethic committee . Participants We enrol child age 5-18 year present impaired consciousness le 7 day duration admit pediatric ward pediatric ICU . Children traumatic brain injury , know vision/hearing impairment , cerebral palsy , mental retardation , degenerative brain disease ; already sedatives neuromuscular blockade ongoing seizure seizure within last 1 hour exclude study . Sample Size From previous study , know ROC GCS child prediction mortality 0.7.15 Assuming FOUR score well predictor outcome ( area curve FOUR score assume 0.8 ) , sample size calculation do use MedcalcR version 9.2.0.1 . The correlation score outcome assume 0.7 . Keeping α-level 0.05 β-level 0.20 , sample size calculate 70 . Assessment Procedure The investigator ( GK ) train standardized video example include DVD prepare developer FOUR score ( Wijdicks et al10 ) . After training , investigator demonstrate score 2 patient supervise Pediatric Neurologist . There periodic training investigator every month review case examples DVD rechecking score periodically . Written inform consent obtain parents/ guardian patient . All observation ( require FOUR score GCS ) investigation ( require PIM2 ) do routinely child admit Pediatric ward/PICU . No additional investigation intervention do primarily study . Standardized care base current guideline provide patient . Rater ( GK ) give one page hand-out write instruction describe FOUR score GCS . The GCS FOUR score apply rater within two hour admission start sedative neuromuscular blockade . The rater primary investigator patient . The sequence application score randomize use block randomization block size 10 patient . Severity illness assess PIM2 score16 . For PIM2 , value various variable time admission Pediatric ward/PICU record . PIM 2-based mortality index evaluate base regression equation publish literature.The child impair consciousness reduce mental state classify obtund , stuporous comatose base classification give Taylor et al.17 The etiology determine base review clinical , laboratory image data Pediatric Neurologist . The patient follow till discharge/ in-hospital mortality . The functional outcome patient assess Pediatric Overall Performance Category ( POPC ) 18 time PICU discharge 1 month follow admission whichever earlier . This scale range value 1 6 value 1 indicate normal function value 6 indicate brain death . Children consider poor outcome score 3-6 POPC scale , consistent moderate severe disability vegetative state , coma brain death . The POPC score obtain direct question child 's ability perform age-appropriate activity , use rehabilitative service , physical disability .</detailed_description>
