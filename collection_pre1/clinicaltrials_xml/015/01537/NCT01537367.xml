Study title : Intervention Trials Retain HIV Patients Medical Care Study sit : The study perform six HIV clinic affiliate academic medical center . Objectives : Using HIV patient ' clinical data ( without personal identifier ) routinely archive electronic database six participate clinic follow : â€¢ To examine extent client-centered intervention deliver trained interventionists ( Phase 2 trial project ) improve patient attendance HIV primary care effect clinic-wide intervention . Phase 2 three-arm randomize control trial conduct participate six clinic . 300 patient enrol Phase 2 trial clinic . One hundred new patient 200 patient inconsistent attendance HIV primary care clinic prior 12 month .

	<detailed_description>Design : Phase 1 use pre-post comparison clinic attendance rate clinic-wide intervention . Phase 2 us randomize controlled trial experimental design . Target population : Adults primary medical care HIV infection 6 site : ( 1 ) University Alabama Birmingham ; ( 2 ) Baylor College Medicine , Houston , Texas ; ( 3 ) Johns Hopkins University School Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland ; ( 4 ) State University New York , Downstate Medical Center , Brooklyn , New York ; ( 5 ) Boston Medical Center , Boston , Massachusetts ; ( 6 ) University Miami Miller School Medicine , Miami , Florida . Primary endpoint : The proportion patient attend one HIV primary care visit three four-month period 12-months . A second measure percentage keep divide schedule primary care visit , exclude cancel visit . Duration study : In Phase 2 trial , enrollment period run six month three-arm intervention run 12 month . Main eligibility criterion : Phase 1 : All patient present clinic begin April 1 , 2009 receive clinic-wide intervention . Attendance data electronic medical record archive clinic ( transmit later CDC ) begin April 1 , 2008 , one year start clinic-wide intervention . Patients least one schedule clinic appointment qualify inclusion study database . In Phase 2 , patient 18 year age old ( 19 year age Alabama ) meet one follow criterion eligible enroll : ( 1 ) new patient ( first second care visit clinic ) , ( 2 ) patient inconsistent attendance HIV primary care -- define least one no-show primary care appointment prior 12 month patient see HIV primary care least two consecutive 6-month period ( among person patient clinic least 12 month . ) Study procedure : In Phase 1 , attendance data maintain electronic database six participate clinic use ( without personal identifier ) examine attendance rate clinic-wide intervention . The Phase 1 clinic-wide intervention include hang poster clinic clinic staff distribute brochures address importance attend HIV care regular basis , importance re-scheduling canceling appointment , HIV primary care provider deliver brief message importance regular clinic attendance patient . In Phase 2 trial , eligible patient ( determine review attendance data clinic 's database ) consent , enrol , randomize receive either ( 1 ) enhance contact plus skill intervention ( 2 ) enhance contact intervention two trained interventionists , ( 3 ) receive standard care clinic ( contact interventionists ) . The Phase 2 trial intervention include periodic one-on-one meeting interventionists address barrier care ( attitude HIV unmet needs transportation , child care , housing , mental health , drug use ) . The interventionists work collaboration patient 's exist case manager ( ) help address need . Additionally , interventionists develop personalize retention plan base patient 's response retention risk screener , deliver information motivational statement importance regular medical care HIV infection , help patient learn navigate complex medical system , maintain contact ( e.g. , via telephone outreach visit ) patient clinic appointment , make reminder telephone call day appointment . Attendance data : Enrollees ' HIV primary care clinic attendance monitor quarterly electronic medical record least 18 month , six month 12 month intervention . Patients enrol trial continue receive regular medical care clinic well clinic-wide intervention . Analysis method : In Phase 1 , cohort patient clinic identify follow time compare attendance ( electronic medical record ) clinic-wide intervention use appropriate method make pre-post comparison . In Phase 2 trial , attendance compare intervention arm broken demographic ( e.g. , gender , race/ethnicity ) clinical subgroup ( e.g. , viral load baseline , self-reported substance use ) examine variable may modify intervention effect . Data Management : Data management analysis primary responsibility CDC , although site also participate data analysis activity . CDC train site data management use Secure Data Network ( SDN ) transmit data file CDC . CDC provide necessary data management guideline research sit . Protocol Development : CDC HRSA lead responsibility development project protocol local IRB review cooperate institution participate research project . HRSA collaboration CDC , organize conduct site investigator ' meeting discuss project 's progress plan next year 's milestone . Protocol Modifications : All protocol modification approve local site IRBs . Local IRB approval obtain protocol change implement . CDC maintain copy current local site IRB approval letter approve consent form .</detailed_description>
