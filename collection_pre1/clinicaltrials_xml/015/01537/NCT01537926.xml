	<brief_summary>The purpose sudy conduct small study gather preliminary data future lage scale clinical study design test potential beneficial efffect over-the counter study anti-oxidant drug call N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) patient heart muscle condition call Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . The present study pilot feasibility study , investigator want find whether investigator recruit retain patient HCM study whether patient tolerate drug stay one year . Likewise , investigator want find potential side effect drug might estimate whether ii beneficial effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypertrophic Regression With N-Acetylcysteine HCM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective perform pilot study patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) mutation gene encode sarcomere protein assess safety gather pre-requisite data subsequent robust randomize placebo-controlled efficacy study N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . We gather data recruitment , accrual , retention , compliance rate HCM patient randomize treatment placebo two escalating dos NAC . Likewise , determine potential side effect estimate effect size NAC indices cardiac hypertrophy . HCM , main focus research past two decade , common cause sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) young important cause morbidity elderly . Despite clinical impact , effective pharmacological therapy HCM . None current pharmacological therapy reverse attenuates cardiac hypertrophy reduces risk SCD adult . Cardiac hypertrophy , quintessential clinical feature human HCM , major determinant morbidity risk SCD . Regression cardiac hypertrophy expect improve morbidity decrease risk SCD HCM , observe upon regression load-dependent cardiac hypertrophy . We generate transgenic rabbit mouse model HCM show cardiac hypertrophy fibrosis could reverse genetic pharmacological intervention . Results NAC , precursor glutathione ; large intracellular thiol pool oxidative stress , promise . In three independent study two different transgenic model HCM ( rabbit mouse ) , treatment NAC completely reverse cardiac hypertrophy fibrosis improve index diastolic function . The ultimate goal every physician-scientist apply bench discovery bedside . We propose test finding animal model human HCM cause sarcomere protein mutation . The use NAC also support data show increased oxidative stress human HCM . Moreover , NAC use extensively humans well-established safety profile . Resources include patient sarcomere protein mutation available successfully complete randomize placebo-controlled ( N=25 ) pilot study test two escalating dos NAC ( N=50 ) , administer one year . We determine recruitment , accrual , retention compliance rate ; tolerability , safety side effect ; estimate effect size NAC indices cardiac hypertrophy , determine serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) baseline one year treatment . Only HCM patient sarcomere protein mutation include exclude phenocopy . The Core center interpret phenotypic data assure homogeneity . Data Coordinating Center assist research design , plan conduct study analysis data . The finding set stage large-scale robust randomize placebo-control efficacy study .</detailed_description>
