	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity highly prevalent associate short- long-term adverse outcome . Despite availability guideline nearly decade recent comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) evidence , health care system slow adopt recommend practice . Although pediatric health care provider often cite barrier limited time , skill , resource , frequently overlook barrier lack data system efficiently accurately assess guideline implementation improve quality care childhood obesity . Health information technology ( HIT ) offer potential accelerate adoption CER evidence regard childhood obesity screen management , establish treatment benchmark , support patient clinical team care improvement . Incorporation HIT may especially effective augmented outreach parent child . The goal study develop test system-level intervention accelerate adoption CER evidence childhood obesity screen management , ultimately improve obesity-related health care quality outcomes . To achieve goal , investigator work two health care system Massachusetts strong track record research collaboration : Cambridge Health Alliance ( CHA ) , integrate academic public health system , Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates ( HVMA ) , large multi-site group practice . Both system use electronic medical record aspects ambulatory care , include point care service electronic order entry centralize function patient schedule . In settings innovation commitment improve quality care , investigator develop test two systematic strategy adoption CER evidence . The first incorporate computerized point care decision alert pediatric primary care provider routine office visit , link CER-based algorithm care . The second augments HIT approach direct-to-parent communication child 's body mass index ( BMI ) along recommend evaluation management . The specific aim study : 1 . In 18 community health center CHA , identify barrier facilitator adoption exist set computerized point care decision alert childhood obesity screen management . The investigator achieve aim in-depth interview survey primary care clinician , inform design investigator propose intervention . 2 . In 14 practice HVMA , conduct cluster-randomized controlled trial examine extent computerize point care decision alert pediatric primary care provider , without direct-to-parent communication , increase adoption CER evidence childhood obesity child 6 12 year age BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile . The investigator determine extent 2 intervention condition , compare usual care control condition , result : 1 . Increased screen assessment childhood obesity point care , include BMI , blood pressure , laboratory screening , provision nutrition physical activity counseling , 2 . A small age-associated increase BMI 1-year period , , 3 . Improved specific dietary , physical activity , sedentary behavior 1-year period . 3 . To evaluate intervention 's cost ( include clinician family time ) cost-effectiveness term child 's change BMI weight-related behavior . 4 . To develop detailed dissemination guide accelerate adoption CER evidence childhood obesity practice community interested implement similar intervention . To achieve investigator aim , investigator assemble research team extensive experience obesity prevention , clinician child behavior change , clinical informatics , statistical methodology cluster randomize controlled trial , cost-effectiveness analysis , dissemination science . If successful , project provide new sustainable approach accelerate adoption CER evidence childhood obesity screen management improve quality care childhood obesity pediatric primary care .</brief_summary>
