	<brief_summary>Presence multiple traditional nontraditional risk factor atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) include inflammation patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) contribute high CVD morbidity mortality patient population . Additionally , traditional approach towards therapy CVD little impact CV mortality patient . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) use anti-inflammatory rheumatological disorder , multiple beneficial property relevant process vascular disease . The effect HCQ atherosclerosis ( AS ) vascular disease CKD know yet . Thus , study hypothesis HCQ treatment individual CKD provide clinically significant benefit management CVD provide biological functional atherosclerotic benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Cardiovascular Disease Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease : A Proof Concept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study design look impact hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) clinical model accelerate atherosclerosis ( AS ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) population . This intervention design impact initiation progression AS reduce systemic inflammation , improve restore vascular endothelial function , improve milieu metabolic syndrome insulin resistance . The current study proof concept study expansion use HCQ new indication treatment AS cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) patient CKD.University Arkansas Medical Sciences ( UAMS ) file Investigational New Drug ( IND ) new indication 4/28/11 . The FDA respond study exempt IND . This `` Proof-of-Concept '' randomize double blind placebo control study evaluate nature extent HCQ effect , find significantly beneficial , use guide development large , multicenter , randomize control trial HCQ examine hard clinical end point CVD mortality patient advance CKD . The investigator propose enroll 62 subject achieve effect HCQ 52 individual ( 39 HCQ group 13 placebo group ) .</detailed_description>
