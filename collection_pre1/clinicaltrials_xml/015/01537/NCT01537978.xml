	<brief_title>Use Interactive Gaming Enhanced Function After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , Nintendo 's Wii become integrate popular culture replete vocabulary market promise achieve fitness video gaming . Recently term `` Wii-habilitation '' gain popularity represent application interactive gaming therapeutic set form rehabilitation . However , technology remain largely untested rehabilitation field despite seemingly widespread use . Interactive gaming may indeed contribute important problem rehabilitation , especially person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) use manual wheelchair primary mobility depend upper extremity independence . Individuals SCI benefit tremendously maximization early rehabilitation post-injury effective ongoing conditioning focus upper extremity continuum care model support life-long health habit . Further , traditional exercise therapy target component function range motion strength , often rely isolated movement repetition might effective method . Alternately , video interactive gaming provide engaging , variable , challenging , fun activity-based approach could enhance adherence exercise functional outcome . A video game system readily implement clinical setting affordably deploy home use minimal instruction , easy use continuation therapy , well-suited SCI population exercise option limit . A wide variety activity game available utilize upper extremity movement `` play '' real world sport golf , tennis , bowling ; multiple option play available add variety contribute comprehensive work-out . Players must grade whole upper limb force play various game parallel traditional exercise regimen ; visual auditory feedback add interest fun session . Interactive gaming allow single multiple player option thus lend readily promotion social engagement . Real-life scenario may contribute self-motivation .</detailed_description>
