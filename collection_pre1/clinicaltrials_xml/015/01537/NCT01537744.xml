	<brief_title>A Trial Oral 5-azacitidine Combination With Romidepsin Advanced Solid Tumors , With Expansion Cohort Virally Mediated Cancers Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two part , single-institution , open-label , Phase I dose-escalation study oral 5-azacitidine combination intravenous ( IV ) romidepsin . Part 1 study traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , pharmacodynamic profile increase dos orally administer 5-azacitidine combination constant dose IV romidepsin . Part 2 expansion cohort study preliminary evaluation efficacy treatment virally mediate cancer liposarcoma MTD determine . PK PD data also collect subject . - Plasma sample obtain , prior treatment , assess methylation status free tumor DNA circulate blood - Archival tissue obtain participant future correlative study , baseline gene expression , methylation pattern . - Participants accessible , biopsiable tumor also undergo pre-treatment post-treatment ( ~cycle 2D1 ) biopsy correlative study expansion cohort .</detailed_description>

AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Disease free prior malignancy ≥ 5 year ( except currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix breast ) . Women childbearing potential advise avoid become pregnant men advise father child receive treatment 5azacitidine . All men/women childbearing potential must use acceptable method birth control throughout study . Serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject sign ICF . Pregnant breastfeed woman . ( Lactating woman must agree breast feed take 5azacitidine ) . Conditions , include laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret study data . Chemotherapy , radiotherapy , experimental drug therapy ≤ 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enrollment adverse event &lt; grade 1 due agent administer &gt; 4 week earlier except stable grade 2 neuropathy . No concomitant investigational agent . Known suspect hypersensitivity 5azacitidine , romidepsin , mannitol agent use study . Uncontrolled brain metastasis . Known positive HIV , infectious hepatitis , type B C. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness Known GI disorder preclude oral administration 5azacitidine . Known cardiac abnormality : Congenital long QT syndrome QTc interval ≥ 500 millisecond ; Myocardial infarction ≤6 month C1D1 . Subjects history myocardial infarction 612 month prior C1D1 asymptomatic negative cardiac risk assessment ( treadmill stress test , nuclear medicine stress test , stress echocardiogram ) since event may participate ; Other significant ECG abnormality include 2nd degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block type II , 3rd degree AV block , bradycardia ( ventricular rate le 50 beats/min ) ; Symptomatic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , e.g. , angina . In patient doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present ; Screening ECG show evidence cardiac ischemia ( ST depression , depression ≥2 mm , measure isoelectric line ST segment ) . If doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present ; Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IV definition and/or ejection fraction &lt; 40 % MUGA scan &lt; 50 % echocardiogram and/or MRI ; Known history sustain ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , Torsade de Pointes , cardiac arrest unless currently address automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( AICD ) ; Hypertrophic cardiomegaly restrictive cardiomyopathy ; Uncontrolled hypertension , i.e. , blood pressure ( BP ) ≥160/95 ; patient history hypertension control medication must stable dose ( least one month ) meet inclusion criterion ; Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic medication ( exclude stable dos betablockers ) Patients take drug lead significant QT prolongation Concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitor</criteria>
