	<brief_summary>Several impair factor contribute physical limitation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) deconditioning , muscle dysfunction physical inactivity . The available literature clearly indicate therapeutic target benefit exercise training patient COPD , currently , key point whether patient exercise , specific contribution exercise modality population . About topic , characteristic physical training program offer patient point discuss among researcher field , although recently high-intensity training recognize superior comparison low-intensity training . Literature also indicate , order change sedentary lifestyle patient COPD , long-term training program indicate . However , doubt still remain : long-term program one key point reduce physical inactivity , yet clear whether necessary include high-intensity exercise long-term program . If duration factor influence outcomes program , thus intensity training could reduce , increase adherence patient protocol . Based hypothesis , aim study compare effect two physical training protocol long-term rehabilitation program ( 6 month ) patient COPD : high-intensity protocol ( base endurance resistive training ) low-intensity protocol ( base callisthenic breathing exercise train ) . It expect result study contribute scientific literature demonstrate whether low- high-intensity training contribute equally change sedentary lifestyle patient long-term exercise program .</brief_summary>
