	<brief_summary>The I-START trial design determine high dos radiotherapy safely use locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Patients NSCLC expect live long three month fit receive radical radiotherapy ( radiotherapy give curative intent ) eligible participate . All trial participant receive 20 dos ( call fraction ) radiotherapy . Evidence available suggests increase dose radiotherapy give per fraction may improve local control cancer survival patient . However , high dose radiotherapy damage normal tissue well tumour . The dose radiotherapy use treat lung cancer limit normal tissue close cancer . For normal tissue ( lung , spinal cord heart ) maximum safe radiotherapy dose give know . The maximum safe dose radiotherapy oesophagus ( gullet ) currently know . The trial split two part : 1 . For participant oesophagus receive high dose radiation due lie close cancer , first part trial establish maximum safe dose radiotherapy oesophagus . The first group participant receive slightly high dose currently use treat lung cancer . If participant significant side effect , second group participant receive slightly high dose first group . This process continue incrementally side effect treatment become evident , thus demonstrate maximum dose safely give . Once maximum safe dose oesophagus know class recommended Phase II dose patient enter trial receive dose oesophagus . 2 . For participant cancer safe distance oesophagus , high dose radiotherapy exceed know safe dose limit normal structure ( lung , spinal cord heart ) use . The finding part study determine whether increase dose radiotherapy NSCLC patient tolerable , safe effective treatment . If result positive new treatment may compare best currently available standard treatment future large randomise ( Phase III ) trial .</brief_summary>

Adequate respiratory function : FEV1 ≥ 1.0 litre , DLco ( transfer factor ) ≥ 40 % predict Kco ( DLco/VA ) &gt; 40 % predict baseline lung function test 6 . Blood Haemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL 7 . No prior thoracic radiotherapy 8 . Age ≥ 16 year 9 . Considered fit receive trial treatment 10 . Estimated life expectancy 3 month 11 . Written inform consent obtain 12 . Patient consent electronic CT scan planning data use future research Main exclusion criterion : 1 . Medically unstable ( e.g . unstable diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , infection , hypercalcaemia symptomatic ischaemic heart disease ) 2 . Previous current malignant disease likely interfere protocol treatment 3 . Pancoast tumours 4 . Connective tissue disorder ( e.g . Scleroderma , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ) 5 . Interstitial lung disease 6 . Women pregnant lactate 7 . Women childbearing potential use adequate contraceptive precaution Primary outcome measure : Phase I : • Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oesophagus use recommend Phase II dose . Phase II : • Toxicity rate ( grade 3 4 ) three month . Secondary outcome measure Phase I : • Chronic oesophagitis stricture occurring/persisting two month completion radiotherapy Phase II : - Local control three month ( include complete response , partial response stable disease ) - Feasibility - Time Local Progression ; measure day day trial entry date first clinical evidence progressive disease primary site - Time distant metastasis measure day - Overall Survival ; measure day , day trial entry day death ( cause ) - Toxicity ; pulmonary , oesophageal , spinal cord cardiac grade 3 4 toxicity occur three month radiotherapy - Radiotherapy Quality Assurance . A detailed QA program place ensure adherence protocol . Major minor deviation document</detailed_description>
