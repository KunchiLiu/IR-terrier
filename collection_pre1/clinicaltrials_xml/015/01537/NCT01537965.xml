	<brief_summary>The non-invasive assessment liver fibrosis chronic viral hepatitis B C enter clinical practice . It base blood test , especially FibroMetre® Fibrotest® elastography Fibroscan® . Despite overall satisfactory diagnostic performance test ( AUROC range 0.80 0.90 depend study ) discrimination F≤1 versus F≥2 , positive negative predictive value , however , far perfect give patient . With technique , failure also possible measure meet quality standard increase risk misclassification . It would particularly useful new generation technique well diagnostic performance . In project , response problem present , propose evaluate diagnostic performance five innovative ultrasonic technique non-invasive diagnosis fibrosis .</brief_summary>
