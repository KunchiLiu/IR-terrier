	<detailed_description>Tubal disease responsible 30-40 % female infertility China . The lesion fallopian tube include occlusion , hydrosalpinx , adhesion . Many technique develop assess tubal pathology . Although laparoscopy visualize morphological abnormality fallopian tube directly widely accept gold standard investigation tubal patency , invasive procedure may carry risk . Hysterosalpingography , use contrast medium radiographic technique visualize uterine cavity tubal lumen , remain first line screen since describe Carey . As essential step infertile work-up , HSG advantage include lack need anesthesia , non-invasive procedure less cost relative easy put practice . Additional , HSG may potential therapeutic effect use oil soluble contrast medium examination . However , would fail detect extra-tubal peritoneal pathology would also difficult distinguish obstruction cause spasm intramural segment . In early meta-analysis , HSG regard limit use evaluate peritubal adhesion low sensitivity . But recently small sample 's report , author argue diagnostic accuracy HSG peritubal adhesion improve analyze special sign radiograph . Obviously , image quality play key role diagnostic accuracy HSG , study take four roentgenogram combine fluoroscopy report high sensitivity specificity take two image examination . And hybridize radiography CT MRI system may provide good-quality HSG . It also report sonosalpingography ( SSG ) , detect tubal patency real time , show pelvic pathology well HSG . However , parallel study design verify hypothesis combine fluoroscopy take image improve diagnostic quality HSG . The aim study evaluate whether accuracy HSG improve real-time evaluating fluoroscopy .</detailed_description>
