	<brief_title>The Effects Antihistamines Pre-Pulse Inhibition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This experiment test efficacy acute anti-histamine dos acoustic startle response prepulse inhibition ( PPI , well-known neurobehavioral phenomenon use characterize sensorimotor modulation describe detail ) male population high baseline sensory startle level . In addition , sex difference baseline PPI ( i.e . without anti-histamine administration ) subject population investigate . The main hypothesis study H1Â¬-antagonist meclizine effective restore low level PPI observe subject pool sensory gate make effective . The dependent measure startle response magnitude pre-pulse inhibition . The experiment take place four session , carry different day . Consecutive test session take place earlier 3 day , longer 21 day apart . Before recruited study , potential participant go phone screen-a pre-experiment screening questionnaire ( separate ) exclude subject neurological disorder , certain psychiatric disorder , smoke use nicotine product , use certain drug ( see exclusion criterion ) affect PPI level . If eligible per phone screen , subject come screening ( test day 1 ) . They ask tobacco/nicotine use medication currently take . They ask caffeine history use . Caffeine caffeine withdrawal effect startle response PPI restrict subject 's caffeine use , collect information . CO level collect use CO monitor confirm participant recently use tobacco product . They ask question psychiatric symptom , personality , cope stress . Participants ' startle response PPI test laboratory ( see ) . During follow three test day ( 2-4 ) dispense study drug , male participant qualify , ask fill questionnaire tobacco nicotine use since previous visit along assess change medication ( specifically verify male participant use allergy , cold/flu medication within 3 day study visit ) . If participant answer yes either question , ask return clinic different day : 1 ) 3 day post use antihistamine 2 ) least 2 week post use tobacco nicotine . Both antihistamine medication tobacco/nicotine recent use effect participant 's PPI need ask male participant possible change . They also ask arrived clinic verify driver come them/dropped , hire driver provide study live Durham come bus foot . They ask caffeine use day experiment . Their baseline sedation level assess . On test day 2-4 , test procedure employ test day 1 repeat , 60 minute start test session , participant receive placebo , low ( 12.5 mg ) dose meclizine , high ( 25 mg ) dose drug counterbalance order . Male participant ( n = 20 ) receive study medication placebo orally provide water administration visit Day 2-4 . Placebo meclizine capsule identical shape , size , color . The randomization counterbalance order dose charge Dr. Levin . In order ensure blind procedure violate , Dr. Levin ( ) provide identical capsule study Study Coordinator container label `` Subject X , day Y '' , ( b ) contact participant study . Meclizine placebo dispense Study Coordinator administrative supervision Dr. Rosenthal , clinical supervision study physician . During rest period pill ingestion experimental task , male participant ask sit lab room read use internet . At 20 minute 40 minute post drug , sedation level assess use scale list . In PPI test session throughout 4 visit , male participant begin rest baseline period 5 minute , ask sit quietly still sound temperature control lab room , eye open look fixation cross monitor . Baseline conduct obtain measure emotional arousal sedation prior experimental manipulation . As , baseline psychophysiological measure collect . Self-reported emotional arousal obtain begin end baseline period use Self-Assessment Manikin ( Bradley , 1999 ) , assess arousal valence affective state use Likert ( 1-9 ) scale . Self-reported level sedation assess time point emotional arousal ( use modify Self-Assessment Manikin use Likert 1-9 scale ) . Next , participant expose initial adaptation phase , order become acquaint startle stimulus ( pulse prepulses ) , startle response reach stable level . In phase , 4 block prepulse-pulse ( pP ) pulse-alone ( P ) trial present , inter-trial interval ( ITI ) 20 second ( +/- 5 sec ) . After initial adaptation phase , participant instruct view computer monitor random geometric figure present , simultaneously 10 block auditory pP P trial present ITI 20 sec . Each test session last around 15 minute . At end test session , standardize lab test ass participant ' attention level describe present . Females complete first day test ( way describe male subject ) .</detailed_description>
