	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Recombinant Human Arginase 1 ( rhArg1 ) Patients With Relapsed Refractory Leukemia Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot , open-label study PEG-BCT-100 patient relapsed/refractory leukemia lymphoma satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion . Approximately 15 subject enrol 10 evaluable subject include study . Evaluable subject define subject receive 4 consecutive dos PEG-BCT-100 1600U/kg within 6 week first 1600U/kg dose complete first disease response assessment . After initiation trial treatment , safety parameter evaluate throughout study . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( NCI CTC AE v4 ) . AE serious AE ( SAE ) detect recorded Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) 15-28 day last dose PEG-BCT-100 . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) /complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) follow 4 consecutive 1600U/kg dos may continue PEG-BCT-100 discretion investigator . Patients achieve partial remission ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) follow 4 consecutive 1600U/kg dos continue treatment disease progression . Further continuation determine clinical judgment Investigator . Patients disease progression discontinue PEG-BCT-100 . Blood sample PK PD analysis collect analyzed .</detailed_description>
