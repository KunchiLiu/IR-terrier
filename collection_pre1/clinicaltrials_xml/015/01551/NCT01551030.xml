	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn effect , good and/or bad , Buparlisib advance urothelial cancer . Buparlisib pill work shut signal cancer cell make tumor grow . It test patient research study one . As 2010 , 80 patient various type cancer receive treatment Buparlisib research study . This clinical research study divide two part . The goal first part study learn study drug Buparlisib shrink slow growth cancer patient urothelial tumor . The goal second part study learn study drug Buparlisib shrink slow growth urothelial tumor patient know certain genetic alteration cause type tumor . The study doctor inform patient part study currently enrol participant . Participants part study receive treatment test . The safety drug also study part . The physical state , change size tumor , laboratory finding take on-study help u decide Buparlisib safe effective .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥60 % Urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter renal pelvis , histologic confirmation MSKCC . Patients unresected primary tumor may enrol long evidence metastatic disease also present . Patients must progressive metastatic disease . Progressive disease define new progressive lesion crosssectional imaging ( RECIST Version 1.1 ) . Patients must previously treat , define follow : Patients must receive treatment least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy agent four prior cytotoxic chemotherapy agent urothelial carcinoma . Up four prior chemotherapy agent allow , since conventional chemotherapy range one drug ( e.g. , gemcitabine ) regimens contain four agent ( e.g. , MVAC fourdrug regimen contain methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , cisplatin ) . The prior therapy must consist least one following : cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine . The prior cytotoxic agent may administer perioperative metastatic setting may administer sequentially ( e.g. , firstline treatment follow secondline treatment time progression ) part single regimen . Patients must least one site measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criterion previously irradiate . If patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence progression since radiation . Patients enrol Phase II study must pretreatment tumor tissue available PI3K/Akt pathway marker analysis : One paraffin block , frozen curl 10 freshlyprepared unstained slide representative single paraffinembedded tumor tissue block submit . Slides primary tumor prefer . If primary metastatic tumor block available , 10 slide site submit . If tissue primary tumor available , paraffin block unstained slide metastatic site acceptable . Fine needle aspirate ( FNAs ) insufficient tumor tissue permit . Patients enrol Expansion Cohort must prior mutational test demonstrate alteration within PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway predict result pathway activation . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) within normal limit ( bisphosphonate use malignant hypercalcemia control allow ) Corrected Calcium = ( 0.8 * ( Normal Albumin Pt 's Albumin ) ) + Serum Ca Potassium magnesium within normal limit Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) within normal range [ ≤ 3.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) liver metastases present ] Serum bilirubin within normal range ( ≤ 1.5 x ULN liver metastases present ; total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN direct bilirubin within normal range patient welldocumented Gilbert syndrome ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance ≥ 50 mL/min INR ≤ 2 Serum amylase lipase ≤ ULN Fasting plasma glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL ( 6.7 mmol/L ) Ability swallow oral medication Patients receive prior treatment P13K inhibitor . Patients receive investigational therapy . Patients know hypersensitivity Buparlisib 120 excipients Patients untreated brain metastasis exclude . However , patient may participate trial &gt; 4 week completion therapy ( radiation and/or surgery ) CNS metastasis , clinically stable time registration receive corticosteroid therapy Patients acute chronic hepatic renal disease pancreatitis Patients follow mood disorder judge Investigator psychiatrist , result patient 's mood assessment questionnaire : Medically document history active major depressive episode , bipolar disorder ( I II ) , obsessivecompulsive disorder , schizophrenia , history suicidal attempt ideation , homicidal ideation ( immediate risk harm others ) ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety Meet cutoff score ≥ 10 PHQ9 cutoff ≥ 15 GAD7 mood scale , respectively , select positive response `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , `` 3 '' question number 9 regard potential suicidal thought PHQ9 ( independent total score PHQ9 ) Patients diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption Buparlisib120 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled , nausea , vomit , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) Patient active cardiac disease include follow : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determined Multiple Grated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) QTc &gt; 480 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) Angina pectoris require use antianginal medication Ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication Conduction abnormality require pacemaker Valvular disease document compromise cardiac function Symptomatic pericarditis Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus steroidinduced diabetes mellitus . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g. , active uncontrolled infection ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol Significant symptomatic deterioration lung function . If clinically indicate , pulmonary function test include measure lung volume , DLCO , O2 saturation rest room air consider exclude pneumonitis pulmonary infiltrates Patients treat hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factor ( e.g. , GCSF , GMCSF ) ≤ 2 week prior start study drug . Erythropoietin darbepoetin therapy , initiate least 2 week prior enrollment , may continue Patients currently receive treatment medication potential prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Refer Appendix A list prohibit QTprolonging medication . Patients receive chronic treatment steroid another immunosuppressive agent Note : Topical application ( e.g . rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g . obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g . intraarticular ) allow . Patients previously treat brain metastasis stable low dose corticosteroid treatment ( e.g. , dexamethasone 2 mg/day , prednisolone 10 mg/day ) least 14 day start study treatment eligible . Patients take herbal medication certain fruit within 7 day prior start study drug . Herbal medication include , limited , St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng . Fruits include CYP3A inhibitor Seville orange , grapefruit , pummelo , exotic citrus fruit . Patients currently treat drug know moderate strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Please refer Appendix A list moderate strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ( Please note cotreatment weak inhibitor CYP3A4 allow ) . Patients receive chemotherapy target anticancer therapy ≤ 4 week ( 6 week nitrosourea , antibody mitomycinC ) prior start study drug whose side effect chemotherapy targeted anticancer therapy recover grade 1 start trial . Patients receive continuous intermittent small molecule therapeutic ( exclude monoclonal antibody ) ≤ 5 effective half live prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . Patients receive wide field radiotherapy ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery , patient may require major surgery course study Patients currently take therapeutic dos warfarin sodium coumarinderivative anticoagulant . Women pregnant breast feeding adult childbearing potential employ effective method birth control . Women childbearing potential , must negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 48 hour prior initiate treatment . Effective method birth control .
