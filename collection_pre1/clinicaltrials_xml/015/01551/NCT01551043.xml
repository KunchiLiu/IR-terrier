	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine safety survival redirect allogeneic T cell transduce anti-CD19 lentiviral vector ( refer CART-19 cell ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allo CART-19 Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose open label , single center , pilot study evaluate safety tolerability , persistence donor lymphocytes engineer express chimeric antigen receptor target CD19 link CD3:4-1BB signal chain patient CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . Upon enrollment , donor undergo leukapheresis patient undergo optional bone marrow/lymph node biopsy approximately four week prior dose . Between dose treatment , patient may undergo additional chemotherapy treatment depend upon disease . At dose , patient receive redirect donor lymphocyte target CD19 ( allo-CART-19 cell ) . The cell dose give split infusion three day enhance ability manage infusion relate toxicity . Patients monitor weekly four week . At end four week , patient undergo second leukapheresis second optional bone marrow/lymph node biopsy . At point patient also undergo restaging . Observation monitoring patient continue monthly basis week 24 post dosing . Annual follow-up lentiviral vector safety carry 15 year accordance FDA guideline retroviral vector . Ten subject target study , expect rate drop 30 % due disease progression enrollment week four post dosing .</detailed_description>
