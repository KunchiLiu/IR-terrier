	<brief_title>Effect Intranasal Neuropeptide Emotion Perception Trait Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive research conduct examine cognitive style anxiety disorder may contribute psychopathology disorder . One consistent finding anxious subject attend preferentially threaten stimulus . This attentional bias , would increase time spent attend process threaten stimuli word , sentence , face , think help provoke maintain anxiety state . This support research demonstrate reduction anxiety symptom associate decrease attentional bias . Related attentional bias concept perceptual bias , people anxiety disorder may perceptive negative emotional cue . For example , Duncan Barrett ( 2007 ) find negative correlation objective awareness quickly present face depict fear extraversion . Participants report great extraversion ( i.e. , pleasure derive social interaction ) less likely see 16 ms presentation face depict fear . Thus , appear someone feel relate may influence information see environment . The investigator thus hypothesize presence chronic anxiety disorder may link perceptual bias , may actually influence information perceive ( sensory experience ) . People anxiety disorder may less likely see positive object likely see negative object . Although neurobiological mechanism underlie anxiety disorder remain uncertain , one hypothesis implicate dysregulation neuropeptide oxytocin . Oxytocin nine-amino-acid peptide role maintain social behavior , find decrease anxiety . Researchers postulate anti-anxiety affect oxytocin related trust pro-approach behavior associate peptide . For example , mice treat oxytocin spend time previously avoid open area maze . In study human use healthy volunteer , participant administer oxytocin placebo play game monetary reward involve trust stranger . Those received oxytocin transfer high amount money player receive placebo . This behavior , involve increase comfort novel individual setting , appear related effect oxytocin . As described , individual high level anxiety perception bias towards emotional stimulus , picture face . Oxytocin 's anxiolytic , pro-approach trust effect may decrease bias , may cause individual experience people thing environment less threatening .</detailed_description>
