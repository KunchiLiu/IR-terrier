	<brief_summary>This study first administration GW824575 human . This single centre , mask , placebo-controlled study , investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) GW824575 , give single repeat oral dos healthy male subject . The study comprise 4 part enroll approximately 40 subject : Part A consist two cohort 8 healthy male subject assess safety , tolerability , PK , PD ascend single oral dos GW824575 . All available safety , tolerability , PK data monitor prior dose escalation . In order support possible indication age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , Part B one cohort 12 subject examine safety , tolerability , PK , PD repeat dose GW824575 21 day healthy male subject great equal 50 year age . The total daily dose cohort exceed maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Parts A D. Subjects cohort undergo ophthalmology assessment receive investigational product Day 7 21-day in-patient treatment , steady state reach . As part protocol amendment 2 , Part C ( Cohort 4 ) remove protocol . Part D , add protocol amendment 2 , consist one cohort 12 healthy male subject assess safety , tolerability , PK , PD ascend single dos GW824575 well effect food PK GW824575 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part A consist two cohort healthy male subject assess safety , tolerability , PK ascend single oral dos GW824575 . The sponsor review available safety , tolerability , PK data , available , PD receptor occupancy ( eosinophil shape change data ) data dose escalation . Outcome measure Part A assess present 48 hour post-dose 4 single dose escalation per cohort . Part B one cohort examine safety , tolerability PK repeat dose GW824575 21 day healthy male subject great equal 50 year age . Subjects cohort undergo ophthalmic assessment receive investigational product Day 7 21-day in-patient treatment , steady state reach . The PD endpoint receptor occupancy assess . The dose regimen ( twice daily ) determine PK data Part A ; however , regardless dose regimen , subject receive single dose morning Days 1 21 treatment period . Outcome measure Part B ( Cohort 3 ) assess present 21 day repeat dose 48 hour post-dose last dose ( i.e. , Day 23 ) . If safety signal note , , conduct Cohort 3 study ; cohort may halt dose down-titrated , additional cohort , low dose , may institute Part B Cohort 5 . Dose selection additional cohort ( Cohort 5 ) inform aggregate safety , PK , PD data available time . Part D consist one cohort healthy male subject . The cohort 1 ) explore effect high fat meal PK GW824575 two treatment period approximately 48 hour washout period 2 ) ass safety , tolerability , PK ascend single oral dos GW824575 administer fast state standard meal 3 additional treatment period least 6-day washout period . The sponsor review available safety , tolerability , PK data , available , PD RO ( eosinophil shape change data ) data dose escalation .</detailed_description>
