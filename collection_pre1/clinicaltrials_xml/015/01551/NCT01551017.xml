	<brief_summary>Fast Track Recovery Arthroplasty Project suppose analyse new medical method accelerate patient 's remobilisation process total knee endoprostheses . The method , call c-treatment , computer-controlled cryotherapy ( soothe cool therapy ) device measure temperature affect site ( operated knee investigator investigation ) optimize cooling temperature . The optimized cooling therapy suppose reduce swell postoperative pain whereby patient 's postoperative mobilization do earlier leading reduction length hospitalization . To verify c-treatment 's efficiency compare conventional cryotherapy , patient split test group standard group . The standard group treat follow standard protocol Department Orthopaedics Surgery Graz use cold pack ( Fa . Dahlhausen , product code 93.000.00.042 ) . Patient 's test group receive c-treatment therapy follow study protocol . All patient instruct fill standardized questionnaire evaluate social score pain score preoperative well postoperative . The knee 's swell range motion well blood parameter monitor heal process measure follow study protocol . The comparison parameter standard test group suppose verify c-treatment 's efficiency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The purpose prospective , randomize , single-blind , comparative control clinical study evaluate new cryotherapy device , cTreatment® system ( Waegener® , Belgium ) consist Cryoceutical Treatment Server 100 series ( CTS ) Cryoceutical Treatment Pad ( cPad® ) , comparison standard cool protocol , cold pack ( cold/hot pack , Dahlhausen® ) currently use Department Orthopaedic Surgery Medical University Graz , Austria , patient undergo primary unilateral TKA surgery . It particularly focus device 's efficiency term eventual improvement patient 's postoperative rehabilitation mobilisation , positive alteration knee ROM NRS pain scale , set primary objective . Further contribute element , alteration analgesic consumption , knee girth device 's safety set secondary objective . METHODS Subjects 18 90 suffering severe degeneratively traumatically cause gonarthritis gonarthrosis knee joint schedule endoprothetic treatment TKA could include give informed consent . Exclusion criteria particularly include , one side , reason , might interfere patient ' statistical comparability regard outcome , severe pre-existing local systemic condition others gonarthritis foregone surgical intervention others arthroscopy . On side contain condition , would interfere plan study design , instance , standardized medication PCA long cool interval hospitalisation . After give write consent randomize cryotherapy group , receive cTreatment® , standard group , receive cold pack application . Therefore web-based programme , `` Randomizer '' , use ( 23 ) , consider patient 's sex schedule design type endoprostheses implant , either PFC® LCS® ( DePuy® , Warsaw , IN , USA ) endoprosthesis . After randomized therapy group patient assign locally apply cryotherapy treatment use cTreatment® system end clinical study , set POD six . That imply first cooling session extent one hour already preoperatively first preoperative day ( PreOD ) , coincidently day admission throughout case . Furthermore , subject receive cryotherapy immediately TKA postanaesthesia care unit six hour total . During in-patient set POD six cTreatment® apply day four hour total , divide two hour morning two hour afternoon . Also option use cTreatment® term additional analgesia even four hour POD . PreOD 1 TKA POD 1 POD 2 POD 3 POD 4 POD 5 POD 6 - 1 h pre-OP 6 h post-OP 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional 2 h morning 2 h afternoon 4 h optional Table 1 : cTreatment® protocol therapy group According manufacturer , CTS class IIa medical device , thermodynamically exchange heat control built-in computer . It able regulate flow rate fluid 's temperature reach cPad® . The CTS operate use touch screen , allow start , pause , resume stop cooling session . According instruction manual cPad® , connect Server flexible tube use anti-reflux design , make flexible Polyurethane , latex free hypoallergenic . Using hook loop fastener easy wrap around knee ensure maximum contact surface . The control group treat abide standard cryotherapy regimen Department Orthopaedic Surgery include usage common cold pack ( cold/hot pack , Dahlhausen® ) . They receive cryotherapy surgical intervention correspond standard regimen . After TKA cold pack apply three time per day 20 minute throughout whole trial . In context blinding , cold pack place beneath applied cPads® subject randomize standard group , order account subjectively experience cold CTS turn . Besides , study set identical group . For purpose good comparability participate patient receive general anaesthesia postoperative analgetic therapy base patient control analgesia ( PCA ) , fill dilute hydromorphone , account 0,2 mg hydromorphone per single dose . In addition , exclusively Novalgin® 4 x 1 g administer non-opiate analgesic . The PCA remove 72 hour postoperative . The performed physical measurement consist quantification knee girth ROM treat knee joint . The measurement concern knee girth perform three different level , middle-patella , 7 centimetre proximal patellar base 7 centimetre distal apex patella . The ROM evaluate use hand-held goniometer patient supine position . Among non-physical evaluation verbally assess subjectively experience pain intensity use eleven-point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) pain score , patient tell zero equal `` pain '' ten equal `` strong pain imaginable '' . The NRS always evaluate state absolute rest state motion . In relation objectively evaluable analgesic consumption record . Therefore total hydromorphone usage administer use PCA 72 hour note . The physical examination knee joint 's ROM girth NRS score evaluation perform admission day POD two , four six . In course regular change dressing medical round surgical area exactly examine potential cold-induced local alteration . In context , particularly search sign frostbite , nerve palsy , inhibit wound healing , deep vein thrombosis infection . In case occurrence , patient also tell immediately call attention eventual adverse effect relate cold therapy , preliminarily inform . IBM® SPSS® Statistics software version 20 use order perform statistical analysis . In regard descriptive statistic conduct use basic calculation mean , standard deviation , range , minima maximum . For comparison two study group admission day , POD two , four six measure data first check existence normal distribution use Shapiro-Wilk Kolmogorov- Smirnov test . In case normal distribution , independent-samples t-test parametric test perform . If normal distribution exist , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test non-parametric test perform order obtain value significance regard between-group distinction . Throughout statistical analysis , level significance , respectively P-value define ≤ 0,05 .</detailed_description>
