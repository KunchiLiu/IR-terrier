	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity increase worldwide epidemic proportion . For long-term treatment success permanent lifestyle change necessary regard approach food , physical activity pattern behavior emotional stress . Moreover , association show sleep disturbance obesity . Weight loss strategy regard food intake regulation mainly focus change pattern fat carbohydrate consumption last decade .
