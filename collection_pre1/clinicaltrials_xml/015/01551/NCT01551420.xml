	<brief_title>Home Study Advanced Upper Limb Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific objective study : 1. identify describe upper limb amputee would appropriate candidate home use advance prosthesis well would appropriate . 2 . Compare extent use exist prosthesis DEKA Arm.and quantify impact home use DEKA Arm device satisfaction , performance functional activity user 's quality life . 3 . Compare outcomes user pattern recognition outcomes user without 4. quantify amount type technical support repair need study , estimate number home study day lose due service/repair . All participate subject enroll Part A study , involve supervise , in-laboratory training , well supervise community base outing . Based upon finding Part A , study staff classify participant appropriate appropriate participation Part B ( home usage portion study ) . Final determination appropriateness home use make home visit . The home use portion study last 13 week involve regularly schedule study visit . Measures exist prosthetic activity compare home use advance upper limb prosthetic device determine extent adoption . Changes device satisfaction , performance functional activity , quality life evaluate throughout study . Data technical support usage also gather .</detailed_description>
