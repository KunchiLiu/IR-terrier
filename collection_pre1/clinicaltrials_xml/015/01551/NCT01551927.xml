	<brief_summary>Aim : To investigate compare woman 's men 's expectation investigation treatment suspect coronary artery disease examine expectation meet . Do woman men , different age , expectation evaluation treatment stable coronary artery disease expectation meet equal degree ? Are differences expectation fulfilment accord age clinical history variable ? Do finding specially develop questionnaire design gather patient ' expectation outcome quality life degree angina pectoris relate appearance designate form ? Is relationship NTproBNP - level , measure cardiac workload , expectation fulfilment well quality life degree angina pectoris ? Method : Patients ask participate study , context medical consultation coronary angiography physician / study nurse . This occur outpatient visit cardiac clinic respective centre . Included patient plan elective coronary angiography possible revascularization eight month period regardless diagnosis . Including four hospital region Västra Götaland .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients ask participate study , context medical consultation coronary angiography physician / study nurse . This occur outpatient visit cardiac clinic respective centre . Included patient plan elective coronary angiography possible revascularization eight month period SKAS , NÄL , SÄS Sahlgrenska University Hospital , regardless diagnosis . Patient inform consent ( attached appendix ) give patient coronary angiography patient visit cardiac clinic respective centre , verbally write physician and/or nurse time consultation participation study . At time approval sign concerned party . This desire do nurse intervention study . The patient fill three questionnaire two occasion ( 10 first patient included reliability test fill expectancy form total three time include question reliability questionnaire ) . The patient also leave two additional blood sample . Patients answer questionnaire developed measure expectation treatment questionnaires measure quality life presence degree angina pectoris , ( SF-36 SAQ Seattle Angina Questionnaire ) . The form expectation validate `` quality life '' form . Blood sample take inclusion six month analyze NTproBNP , biochemical measure much strain coronary artery disease put heart muscle . We want examine whether level NTproBNP six month coronary angiography correlate quality life expectation inquiry extent expectation meet . To ensure equal treatment , important build patient perspective set offer treatment availability , relation individual patient 's expectation . The following three instrument use measure symptom , functional limitation , expectation : - SAQ ( Seattle Angina Questionnaire ) primarily formulate measure functional status patient coronary artery disease . SAQ consist 19 five-scale question , physical limitation ( nine question ) , angina grade ( one question ) , frequency angina ( two question ) , satisfaction treatment ( two question ) perception disease ( five question ) , therefore measure dimension physical limitation , angina degree , satisfaction treatment Perception illness . The form take five minute fill . It general measurement quality life ( 7 ) . - SF-36 partially consist scale measure physical function ( 10 question ) , role functioning-physical cause ( four question ) , role function-emotional reason ( three question ) , social functioning ( two question ) pain ( two question ) , It also consist scale welfare , measure mental health ( five question ) , vitality ( four question ) , general health ( five question ) change health ( one question ) . This instrument take five-10 minute complete ( 8.9 ) . - The Expectation Form develop instrument consist questionnaire 11 question expectation future care treatment , follow-up questionnaire six month later , examine whether expectation patient meet . The form take five minute fill . The form evaluate validated follow ( 10 ) : - Reliability-test do four experienced professional , knowledgeable topic review questionnaire . - The first 10 enrolled patient complete questionnaire . This make additional occasion time angiography . We 'test re-test , week apart test re-test . At additional occasion patient also answer question questionnaire fill i.e . check user friendliness understand form . - Validation form do SF-36 , SAQ , NTproBNP criterion . All data clinically relevant record patient 's medical record accord standard procedure . Case Record Form ( CRF ) cod anonymous , code list store research nurse , include hospital . Decoded CRF send store Sahlgrenska University Hospital , department Cardiology . Processing statistical data cod anonymous . The people manage data involve study well cardiologist research unit 's coordination staff monitor staff . Ethical issue must always consider study people chronic serious illness include . Requirements information study opportunity connect responsible , respect integrity none shall harm fundamental ethical principle must follow . Anonymity confidentiality guaranteed . It also important clarify possibility end participation study consequence care treatment . Out privacy standpoint , risk patient may feel exposed filling questionnaire relate life situation , personal health relationship health care . We inform patient carefully handle data data may link individual patient compile present . data enter manage via Cardiology Research Unit , Sahlgrenska University Hospital . These data available researcher participate study . The lead applicant responsible data processing ( Statisticians ) primarily responsible report . Statistic : Data process statistical analysis do consultation statistician . For eight month , expect , base past experience , able include 800 consecutive patient undergo elective coronary angiography SKAS , NÄL , SÄS Sahlgrenska University hospital . Of , half estimate coronary artery disease rest survey do part investigation cardiovascular disease valvular disease heart failure . The gender distribution estimate 70 % men 30 % woman . Dichotomous variable ( baseline characteristic ) give frequency compare sex chi 2 Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Continuous variable present mean value standard deviation compare Student t-test . Comparisons different age group make ANOVA . Answer quality life degree angina pectoris instrument , convert score accord establish schedule . Comparison score baseline six month angiography do paired Student t-test group two-way ANOVA , non-parametric test depend distribution data . The form expectation analyze answer question use statistic . The study explorative customary power calculation do . As indicated , expect patient material heterogeneous respect clinical condition , indication angiography , sex age . It therefore important collect many material possible order compare different group . Based SF 36 state 50 patient two group need one detect difference range five point ( total point instrument often 45-50 depend patient group ) five-point standard deviation , 0.05 power 80 % .</detailed_description>
