	<detailed_description>Early colonoscopy screen encourage prevention development colorectal cancer colonoscopy procedure allow removal pathological polyp reduces risk cancerous development . While colonoscopy regard minimally invasive procedure , procedure often associate abdominal pain discomfort , especially colonoscope pass colonic angulation . The unpleasant feeling colonoscopy may affect patient 's overall tolerance procedure thereby jeopardize accuracy outcome finding . A combination narcotic analgesia benzodiazepine often use decrease abdominal pain colorectal discomfort colonoscopy . However medication also associate side effect nausea vomit . Although uncommon , respiratory cardiac arrest colonoscopy report . Colonoscopy outpatient day-procedure , unwanted side effect however could prolong recovery time increase demand post-intervention nursing care , thereby affect cost-effectiveness medical model . Undesirable pharmacological side effect recently lead exploration alternative management strategy minimize patient discomfort colonoscopy . Electroacupuncture ( EA ) widely accept China consider worldwide possible treatment option acute chronic pain various origin . The role acupuncture manage pain anxiety colonoscopy however unclear . A randomized sham-controlled study ( involve 30 patient ) suggest patient receive EA acupoints include Zusanli ( stomach meridian ST-36 ) Hegu ( large intestine meridian LI-4 ) low pain level colonoscopy receive sham acupuncture ( SA ) , difference non-significant statistically . Recently investigator show application 45 minute EA Hegu ( LI4 ) , Neiguan ( PC6 ) Zusanli ( ST36 ) able effectively reduce colorectal discomfort Barostat-induced rectal distension . Acupuncture however invasive , application require experienced acupuncturist . Application Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) acupuncture point ( Acu-TENS ) non-invasive modality novel analgesic therapy combine advantage acupuncture TENS management painful condition . Acu-TENS show effective reduce postoperative analgesic requirement compare TENS nonacupoints . It postulate TENS possibly modulate noxious stimulus pain via control 'pain-gate ' release Î²-endorphin . The efficacy Acu-TENS pain-relief colonoscopy report . This current study aim investigate effect Acu-TENS barostat-induced rectal discomfort . A dual drive barostat device use mimic colonoscopy order control nature , intensity duration isobaric distension .</detailed_description>
