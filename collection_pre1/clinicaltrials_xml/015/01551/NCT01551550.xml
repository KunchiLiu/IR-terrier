	<brief_title>Shunt Tube Exposure Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma drainage device ( GDDs ) use treatment high-risk refractory glaucoma . To avoid tube exposure , may lead serious eye infection , implant GDD tube must cover patch graft , traditionally make either donor sclera pericardium . However , patch graft still carry high rate progressive thinning erosion , complication investigator speculate result lack cellular infiltration surround host conjunctival stroma poor integration patch graft host tissue . The investigator speculate thicker version cryo-preserved amniotic membrane ( AM ) , manufacture Bio-Tissue , Inc. , could offer good tensile strength , suitable tectonic support , biological activity promote cellular infiltration surround host conjunctival stroma , thus reduce progressive allogeneic patch graft thinning/erosion . Through SBIR Phase I grant support ( R43 EY19785 ) , investigator evaluate thicker AM alternative patch graft cover GDD tube primary implantation . The investigator monitor host cell interaction use anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The investigator successfully accomplish propose aim study , demonstrate short-term stability/efficacy AM cover tube primary GDD surgery ( Phase I-Aim 1 ) confirm feasibility use OCT distinguish host cell infiltration AM transplantation GDD tube ( Phase I-Aim 2 ) . In SBIR Phase II , investigator propose conduct prospective , control study compare long-term safety efficacy thicker AM ( AmnioGuard™ , Bio-Tissue , Inc , Miami , FL ) pericardium ( Tutoplast® , IOP Inc , Costa Mesa , CA ) secure GDD tube reduce tube exposure graft thin patient high risk glaucoma . The investigator also study risk factor may contribute GDD tube exposure . Accomplishment Phase II study position AM effective alternative exist patch graft reduce tube exposure enhance success GDD implantation , provide well aesthetic appearance allow visualization tube patient high risk glaucoma . The investigator speculate graft might also clinical application outside cover GDD tube .</detailed_description>
