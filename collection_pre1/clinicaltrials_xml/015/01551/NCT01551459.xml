	<brief_summary>Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma radiotherapy surgery . But cancer spread , difficult treat . Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma spread chemotherapy call dacarbazine , always look find new way treat uveal melanoma . This study aim find well Sunitinib work treat uveal melanoma see long Sunitinib Dacarbazine help prevent cancer get bad .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Sunitinib Versus Dacarbazine Treatment Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>124 eligible patient randomise either Sunitinib Dacarbazine treatment . Participants attend 3-weekly clinic visit undergo 12-weekly tumour assessment ( CT MRI scan ) disease progression ( accord RECIST 1.1 ) identify .
