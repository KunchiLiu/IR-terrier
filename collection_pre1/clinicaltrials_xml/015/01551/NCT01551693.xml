	<brief_summary>STA9090 drug inactivates block work protein call Heat Shock Protein 90 HSP90 . HSP90 protein help molecule inside cell right shape . By stop HSP90 's activity , molecule never get right structure functional destroyed . The investigator believe stop activity HSP90 , rapidly divide cell tumor ( ) may slow . In research study investigator look see well STA9090 work stop spread melanoma .</brief_summary>
