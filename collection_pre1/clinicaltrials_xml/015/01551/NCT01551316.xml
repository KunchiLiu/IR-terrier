	<brief_summary>In MediciNova 's clinical development plan MN-221 , recognize treatment COPD exacerbation may necessitate one single i.v . infusion patient population may co-morbidities ( concomitant medication ) generally study far . Thus , primary objective clinical study determine repeat administration safety tolerability intravenous ( i.v . ) MN-221 compare placebo repeat administration several day moderate severe COPD patient may also co-morbidities concomitant medication ( CM ) common population . Secondary outcome include pharmacokinetics ( PK ) preliminary efficacy ( FEV1 ) . This Phase 1b trial follow naturally upon Phase 1b COPD trial complete last year ( MN-221-CL-010 ) additionally well-supported relevant animal safety data human clinical trial information .</brief_summary>
