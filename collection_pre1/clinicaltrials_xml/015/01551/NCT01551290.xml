	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Infliximab Chinese Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , placebo control ( placebo inactive substance compare medication test whether medication real effect clinical study ) , double blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment patient receives ) , 2-arm ( 2 group ) , parallel group ( clinical study compare response two group participant receive different treatment ) study infliximab patient active ulcerative colitis . The study consist screen period ( 4 week prior baseline [ patient 's medical status treatment research do ] Week 0 ) , treatment period ( Week 0 Week 22 ) follow period ( Week 26 ) . Participants complete treatment till Week 22 benefit continue treatment ( opinion investigator ) may enter study extension period Week 30 Week 58 . Hundred participant randomize 2 group : Group 1 ( 50 participant receive placebo ) Group 2 ( 50 participant receive infliximab ) . Effectiveness safety ( physical examination , review AEs , vital sign , laboratory analysis , concomitant medication ) evaluate Week 8 Week 26 Week 58 ( participant enter extension phase ) . The maximum duration participant main study 26 week . The maximum duration participant include study extension 58 week . One specialized procedure use calculate efficacy Mayo score calculate use subscore ( record Mayo Diary Card participant ) follow 4 variable ( 1 ) stool frequency ( score range 0 [ normal number stools patient ] 3 [ 5 stool normal ] ) , ( 2 ) rectal bleeding ( score range 0 [ blood see ] 3 [ blood alone pass ] ) , ( 3 ) endoscopic finding ( score range 0 [ normal inactive disease ] 3 [ severe disease ie , spontaneous bleed ulceration ] ) , ( 4 ) physician 's global assessment ( score range 0 [ normal ] 3 [ severe disease ] ) .</detailed_description>
