	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Single Dose CRS3123</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , multi-center , placebo-controlled , double-blind , dose-escalation study evaluate safety tolerability CRS3123 , methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor . Since FIH study new class drug , maximum safe start dose estimate NOAEL preclinical study accordance FDA guidance document ( FDA Guidance Industry , July 2005 ) . A low start dose chosen . In initial Cohorts , dose 100 , 200 400 give ; estimate human start dose . If significant safety signal encounter , investigator notify SMC call review . Dose escalation Cohorts D E require full SMC review safety data obtain Day 7 precede Cohorts . Forty healthy male female subject 18 45 year , inclusive , admitted inpatient study . Each subject receive single oral dose CRS3123 placebo . There 8 patient cohort ( 6 active , 2 placebo ) . The ascend dos 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 1200 mg respectively cohorts A E. The primary outcome measure safety tolerability CRS3123 , evaluate sequential review report adverse event , change baseline finding physical examination , change baseline vital sign measurement , safety laboratory test ( hematology , chemistry , urinalysis ) , change baseline key ECG finding . The secondary outcome measure pharmacokinetics CRS3123 determine compare measure plasma urine CRS3123 concentration oral administration CRS3123 multiple specify time point follow dose administration .</detailed_description>
