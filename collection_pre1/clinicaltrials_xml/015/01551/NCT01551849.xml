	<brief_title>Echocardiographic Assessment Function During ECMO Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . What major problem address study ? Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) machine use work heart lungs child 's heart lung sick perform normally . Veno-arterial ( VA ) ECMO therapy poor heart function provide support lead patient recovery , transplantation appropriate eligible , complication ECMO therapy lead stop care . Each day patient ECMO , complication occur require stop support , attempt get ECMO quickly possible important . There currently consistent way assess heart function patient support VA-ECMO help guide child 's heart improve enough survive without help ECMO . 2 . What specific question ask attempt answer ? The specific question ask whether new ultrasound measure heart function predict patient may well enough able come ECMO support . We follow critically ill patient perform multiple measurement specific time point look change patient whose heart function recovers patient recover function . The ultrasound measurement perform change amount support provide ECMO machine . - 3 . What long-term biomedical significance work , particularly pertain cardiovascular area ? What major therapeutic advance ( ) anticipate lead ? For instance , new drug ( ) , surgical technique/procedure , diagnostic tool/test , previously undetected risk factor , etc . Our long term goal develop non-invasive , quantitative measure cardiac function patient need ECMO support help guide care . Ultimately deemed successful , measurement could use physician care patient . This study could lead efficient prediction need stay ECMO could remove . This could help improve survival decrease complication sickest child . These measurement may also help u identify , early stage , patient whose heart sick recover need heart transplant evaluation .</detailed_description>
