	<detailed_description>Study aim : 1 . To calibrate CellDetect® device detect TCC urine cytology sample . 2 . Determine performance CellDetect® device identify TCC recurrence patient history TCC use urine cytology sample . The study include two part : Part I Open label , control , Calibration part aim calibrate CellDetect® device identify bladder cancer cell urine sample . Part II Prospective , control , blind part determine performance CellDetect® device monitor bladder cancer recurrence patient history TCC , use urine cytology sample * The following subject enrol : Subjects previously diagnose bladder cancer undergo routine cystoscopic surveillance , TURT Cystectomy . Part I - 200 urine eligible sample Part II - 300 urine eligible sample Endpoints : 1 . To calibrate CellDetect® device identify TCC urine cytology sample . 2 . To determine performance CellDetect® device identify recurrence TCC urine sample .</detailed_description>
