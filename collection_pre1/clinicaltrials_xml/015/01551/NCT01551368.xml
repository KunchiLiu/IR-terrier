	<brief_summary>Nimodipine ( Nimotop® Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation ) , unlike calcium channel blocker fat soluble therefore able cross blood-brain barrier1 . Gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) neuron cluster hypothalamus dependent calcium flux release GnRH responsible release follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) anterior pituitary . In natural menstrual cycle spontaneous LH surge occur mid-cycle trigger ovulation . The investigator hypothesize nimodipine , block calcium channel , may effectively suppress release GnRH consequently natural LH surge . In prospective double-blinded randomize study investigator evaluate efficacy nimodipine inhibit natural LH surge woman undergo controlled ovarian stimulation ( COS ) intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) . Nimodipine , successful , may represent inexpensive oral medication alternative currently use GnRH agonists GnRH antagonist assist reproductive technology like IVF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Calcium Channel Blocker Prevent Premature Luteinizing Hormone Surges Infertility Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In reproductive aged woman regular ovulatory cycle generate 1-2 mature ovarian follicle every month . Approximately mid-cycle natural LH surge observe predictably induces ovulation within 24-36 hour . LH hormone produce anterior pituitary gland release response GnRH . Concurrently GnRH synthesize release pulsatile manner GnRH neuron within hypothalamus . One essential step successful IVF ensure properly time aspiration mature follicles ovary prior ovulation . If ovulation precede aspiration oocyte would already release become unobtainable . Therefore inhibit spontaneous ovulation crucial component successful oocyte retrieval . In clinical setting IUI oocyte retrieval require , appropriate timing insemination respect ovulation critical . A premature LH surge subsequent premature luteinization may occur third ovarian stimulation cycle use gonadotropin ( applicable IUI IVF cycle ) , make major cause treatment cancellation negative impact pregnancy outcomes 2-5 . The commonly used medication prevent premature LH surge GnRH agonists recently GnRH antagonist . They commonly administer subcutaneously daily basis act anterior pituitary gland ( different mechanism ) inhibit release LH . Besides additional patient cost burden , medication associate prolonged treatment protocol decrease ovarian response stimulation . Nimodipine unique calcium channel blocker lipophilic property great affinity cerebral vasculature , therefore ability cross blood-brain barrier . In study mouse induce intracerebral hemorrhage , nimodipine treatment improve cerebral bloodflow display anti-ischemic effect . Nimodipine obtain FDA approval reduce severity neurological deficit patient recent subarachnoid hemorrhage . On cellular level nimodipine show inhibit pulsatile activity GnRH gene expression , intrinsic property GnRH neuron necessary proper initiation LH surge . Specifically , nimodipine block L-type voltage gate calcium channel prevent influx extracellular calcium subsequently stimulation GnRH release . The intrinsic pulsatile secretion GnRH directly associate rhythmic change intracellular calcium concentration GnRH neuron . Study Objectives Endpoints Primary Objective 1 . To determine nimodipine effectively inhibit natural LH surge woman undergo controlled ovarian stimulation intrauterine insemination . Secondary Objectives 2 . To determine medication side effect profile nimodipine , specifically symptoms hypotension , tachycardia , nausea headache . 3 . To determine treatment compliance rate ( nimodipine placebo ) . 4 . To determine clinical pregnancy rate intervention arm ( nimodipine placebo ) COS IUI treatment cycle . Primary Endpoint 1 . The presence absence LH surge intervention Day 1 Day 2 . LH surge determine serum LH level least two time baseline serum LH . Baseline serum LH = ( Cycle Day 3 serum [ LH ] + Cycle Day 7 serum [ LH ] ) /2 . Secondary Endpoint 2 . Medication side effect profile : - Symptomatic hypotension [ Note : vital sign routinely record ] - Symptomatic tachycardia [ Note : vital sign routinely record ] - Headache - Nausea ( self-reporting ; construct questionnaire ) 3 . Patient treatment compliance ( self-reporting ; construct questionnaire ) 4 . Clinical Pregnancy ( positive BHCG ultrasound evidence fetal heart rate ) Study Design Recruitment / Baseline Assessment The study population derive pool patient refer TCART ( Toronto Centre Assisted Reproductive Technology ; Toronto , Canada ) . Patients comprehensively evaluated infertility subsequently recommend undergo control ovarian stimulation intra-uterine insemination approach recruit participate study . Patients screen evaluated eligibility ( base inclusion exclusion criterion ) direct contact one dedicate study investigator dedicate research staff . Randomization Randomization computer generate block design 6 patient . Six correspond opaque envelope enclose blind medication administer sequentially consent patient . Randomization perform start COH cycle consequently data analyze intention-to-treat analysis . Blinding Procedures Both patient medical staff blind treatment arm . Both nimodipine ( 30 mg po qid ) placebo group ( placebo po qid ) receive 8 identical tablet instruction self-administration . The capsule identify unique study number allow accurate analysis end study . A single pharmacy responsible blinding , label packaging medication . Only study coordinator ( DN ) , involve clinically study participant , remain unblinded . Interventions Drug Formulation Nimotop® ( Nimodipine ) Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation . Calcium channel blocker . 30mg oral soft gelatin capsule . Dosage Regimen Nimodipine rapidly absorb oral administration reach peak concentration within one hour . It half-life approximately 1-2 hour terminal clearance half-life 8 hour , thus require relatively frequent administration . It currently approve acute treatment subarachnoid hemorrhage , dose regimen 60mg po q4h 21 consecutive day . Several pharmacokinetic study focus 30mg dos three time daily evidence accumulation . In study intervention initiate ovarian follicle maturation document ( ≥1 ovarian follicle size ≥ 17mm ) absence premature LH surge confirm - classify intervention day 0 . Patients receive oral nimodipine 30mg four time daily two day period follow dose schedule : - Intervention Day 0 - noon / afternoon / bedtime ( 3 dos ) - Intervention Day 1 - morning / noon / afternoon / bedtime ( 4 dos ) - Intervention Day 2 - morning ( 1 dose ) Washout Period Nimodipine eliminate almost exclusively form metabolite . Less 1 % recovered urine unchanged drug . Over 95 % medication bound plasma protein . Nimodipine half life 1-2 hour , terminal elimination half life approximately 8 hour . It completely eliminate body 40 hour . Contraindications Nimodipine use - Hypersensitivity active substance excipients Nimodipine . - The use Nimodipine combination Rifampicin Precautions Nimodipine use - Caution require patient hypotension - Nimodipine metabolize cytochrome P450 3A4 system , therefore drug ( grapefruit juice ) know either inhibit induce enzyme take account , include : - Rifampicin - Quinupristin / Dalfopristin - Valproic Acid - Nortryptyline Secondary Outcome variable : - Side effect - Nausea , headache , lightheadedness , dizziness , diaphoresis , presyncopal palpitations/tachycardia . - Treatment compliance - Number tablet take ( prescribed 8 tablet ) , appropriate timing medication ( instruct ) - Clinical pregnancy → positive bHCG serum test 2 week post IUI ultrasound documentation fetal heart rate Study - Delayed Ovulation Induction Monitoring : - Deviating routine practice , study protocol call two-day delay hCG injection ultrasound detection mature ovarian follicle ( intervention day 0 ) . At time point patient already randomize blind receive nimodipine 30 mg po qid , placebo po qid two day ideally prevent natural LH surge 48 hour . - During two day period study patient ( nimodipine placebo ) continue monitor daily clinic ( morning day 1 day 2 ) include transvaginal ultrasound serum measurement estradiol , LH progesterone . - If two day period LH surge detect daily morning monitoring ( eg . day 1 day 2 ) , standard protocol ovulation induction IUI initiate - injection hCG 250 mcg afternoon two IUIs perform 16 hour 40 hour hCG injection . Participant discontinue take assigned medication LH surge detect . - If LH surge detect daily monitoring day 1 , patient continue take assigned medication daily monitoring . - If LH surge detect daily monitoring day 2 , ovulation induce afternoon ( ~5 pm ) injection hCG 250 mcg follow single IUI 40 hour later . Safety Adverse Events Patients undergo COS IUI regularly monitor optimal treatment response time IUI . Therefore investigator study also opportunity closely observe safety adverse event associate two-day duration active intervention ( nimodipine 30mg po qid x 48 hour ) . Specifically patient ask medication ( nimodipine placebo ) compliance side effect experience morning cycle monitoring ( day 1 day 2 ) . Nimodipine traditionally investigate high , frequency long duration . According product monograph1 , dose regimen nimodipine 60mg po q4h result following side effect : hypotension ( 3.8 % ) , nausea ( 1.2 % ) , headache ( 1.2 % ) bradycardia ( 1 % ) . Conservative management consist discontinue nimodipine generally effective reversing symptom . Data Analysis Plan / Statistical Plan Data express mean +/- SD percentage applicable . Independent sample compare use Student test . The chi-squared test Fisher exact test use categorical data . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . Sample Size Power Sample size calculation perform use computer program PS : Power sample size calculation William Dupont . We plan study independent sample treatment control 1:1 randomization . Expert opinion / prior data suggest approximately 50 % patient placebo arm natural LH surge detect day 2 post intervention follicular maturation reached15 . If 20 % patient nimodipine arm natural LH surge detect day 2 post intervention , need 38 subject study arm reject null hypothesis ( group equal incidence natural LH surge day 2 post intervention ) power 0.8 type I error probability 0.05 . We anticipate approximately 15 % dropout rate lead total recruitment 90 patient ( 45 per study arm ) .</detailed_description>
