	<brief_title>Sober Network IPT Perinatal Women With Comorbid Substance Use Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substance use disorder ( SUD ) major depressive disorder ( MDD ) significant interconnect public health problem face woman , especially perinatal woman . Perinatal woman co-occurring SUD-MDD public health concern face numerous neonatal obstetrical risk addition emotional distress , impairment , adverse health effect associate disorder . MDD common woman SUD , often remit SUD treatment , increase risk poor SUD treatment outcome , treat . Despite serious morbidity associate SUD MDD perinatal woman despite consensus among perinatal researcher need population-specific treatment address unique set challenge associated period woman 's life , virtually intervention develop tested address specific need perinatal woman comorbid substance use depression . Furthermore , many test exist treatment SUD-MDD population demonstrate limited efficacy least one two disorder . The investigator propose pilot test novel 18-20 week group treatment SUD-MDD , Sober Network Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) , focus network support strategy SUD ( i.e. , enhancement active sober support ) within broad Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) framework . IPT treatment choice MDD perinatal population . Sober network support theoretically consistent IPT identify empirically support mechanism change many efficacious SUD treatment . Interpersonal difficulty affect MDD , also strong predictor SUD relapse woman . A social/interpersonal approach SUD-MDD may highly efficacious relevant need perinatal woman specific interpersonal challenge become salient perinatal period . Pilot work ( support Dr. Johnson 's NIDA K23 ) , show IPT-based treatment feasible , acceptable , efficacious MDD among woman prisoner SUD-MDD , another vulnerable population multiple need . Thus , Sober Network IPT integrate validate treatment perinatal MDD empirically support SUD principle , use propose mechanism particularly relevant perinatal period target population . The purpose R34 Exploratory Research proposal ( ) integrate network support strategy SUD IPT framework create Sober Network IPT perinatal woman substance use MDD ( b ) collect preliminary data feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy within clinical set collaboration community therapist . Attempting obtain definitive effect size estimate intend outcome R34 give limited sample size typically supportable mechanism . The investigator , however , collect preliminary information explore potential treatment difference likely effect size range . Findings proposal lay groundwork large clinical trial . The development aim R34 proposal : 1 . Adapt IPT Sober Network IPT perinatal woman substance use MDD . 2 . Develop , implement , evaluate therapist train program competence adherence scale . 3 . Improve clarity , content , acceptability , feasibility Sober Network IPT use information gather two focus group small open trial ( n = 6 ) perinatal woman substance use MDD . The pilot study aim R34 proposal : 1 . Conduct randomize pilot trial sample 50 woman meet criterion substance use MDD pregnancy within one year postpartum demonstrate feasibility acceptability propose recruitment method research design , therapist training method , deliver Sober Network IPT treatment . 2 . Examine preliminary evidence hypothesis , relative treatment-as-usual , Sober Network IPT result : - Fewer heavy drinking/drug use day 3 month follow-up ( primary ) . - Reduced depressive symptom post-treatment 3 month follow-up ( primary ) . - Improved sober support social support ( secondary ) . 3 . Explore feasibility use fetal , neonatal infant outcome engagement health prevention activity ( immunization well-child visit ) secondary outcome subsequent trial . As result R34 Exploratory Research Project , investigator adapt IPT Sober Network IPT , novel treatment approach perinatal woman substance use MDD , test feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy eye toward dissemination ( see D2.13 ) , investigator prepare test efficacy future R01 clinical trial . From long term perspective , program research advance clinical care research endeavor perinatal woman substance use MDD ; underserved woman clinical concern great public health significance . Furthermore , Sober Network IPT find efficacious vulnerable target population , investigator anticipate could hold promise heterogeneous substance use MDD population .</detailed_description>
