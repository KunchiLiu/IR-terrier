	<brief_title>Use Polyethylene Glycolic Acid Tachocomb Prevent Pancreatic Fistula Following Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal pancreatectomy call various name , left-sided pancreatectomy , distal partial pancreatectomy . It difficult define part pancreas distal exactly , typically superior mesenteric vein ( SMV ) splenic vein , come meet portal vein form area cover pancreas , neck actually base relatively thin pancreatic resection area , leave distal pancreatic resection generally define . Indication distal pancreatectomy Western country trauma ( 16 % ) , pancreas cancer ( 18 % ) , neuroendocrine tumor ( 14 % ) , chronic pancreatitis ( 24 % ) , benign disease ( 22 % ) Korea , contrast , disease cause inflammatory process chronic pancreatitis relatively low incidence . But rate combine resection distal pancreas time gastric surgery relatively high . Definitions names pancreatic fistula report differently center . Heidelberg Johns Hopkins group define pancreatic fistula drain amylase level three time normal serum value , 50mL 24 hour postoperative 10 day . German Italian group define drain amylase level three time normal serum value , 10mL 24 hour postoperative 3-4 day . Japanese group define pancreatic fistula drain amylase level three time normal serum value , persistent drainage postoperative 7 day . Lowy et al define clinically significant pancreatic fistula 38â„ƒ fever leukocytosis ( &gt; 10,000 cells/mm3 ) , sepsis associate necessity drainage abdominal fluid . To adjust various criterion , International Study Group Pancreatic Fistula ( ISGPF ) 2005 define pancreatic fistula drain amylase level three time normal serum value time postoperative 3 day , divide severity 3 category A C accordance clinical course . As followed previous study , pancreatic fistula one major postoperative complication ( 13-64 % ) , lead cause intra-abdominal infection , abscess , septicemia , wound infection , postoperative bleeding , malnutrition Risk factor relate pancreas fistula present disease- associate factor ( pancreatic hardness , pathological finding , diameter main p- duct , thickness pancreas resection area ) , surgery-related factor ( method pancreas resection , intraoperative blood loss , operative time , blood transfusion surgery ) , patient-related factor ( age , sex , race , comorbidity ) experience surgeon , etc . Based experience observation list risk factor pancreatic fistula , rarely report incidence pancreatic fistula markedly reduce kind method . As mention , one risk factor pancreatic fistula operative method technique . To date , many method suggest reduce pancreatic fistula . For example , deal pancreas cut surface , several method , , hand-sewn suture technique , staple closure , use fibrin glue , use mesh . But evidence superiority method . Recent retrospective study suggest usefulness mesh incidence pancreatic fistula mesh ( 5.6-27 % ) low without mesh ( 38.9~42.0 % ) . There two kind mesh use surgical field , PGA tachocomb . Among , method PGA report retrospective study . Moreover , report effectiveness Tachocomb . The objective prospective multicenter randomize study clarify proper method reduce pancreatic fistula PGA tachocomb .</detailed_description>
