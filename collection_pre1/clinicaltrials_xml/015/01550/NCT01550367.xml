	<brief_summary>The main goal research study determine whether treat renal cell cancer patient study drug , hydroxychloroquine , along IL-2 , standard treatment kidney cancer spread part body , make cancer easy kill eliminate . Another goal see study drug affect body 's immune cell fight cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hydroxychloroquine Aldesleukin Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale combine high dose bolus aldesleukin hydroxychloroquine include potential positive interaction immune regulatory side , non-overlapping toxicity , potential prolongation increase number response base murine study conduct University Pittsburgh . This study multi-center phase II study design estimate efficacy combination therapy standard high dose bolus IL-2 various dos hydroxychloroquine therapy metastatic RCC patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic renal cell carcinoma predominantly clear cell histology . Have measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . For example , would include tumor lung , liver , retroperitoneum . Bone disease difficult follow quantify sole site would acceptable . Patients must least 4 week radiation surgery recover ill effect . Age ≥18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥80 % . Adequate end organ function : 1 . Hematologic : ANC ≥ 1000cells/uL , platelet ≥ 100,000/uL , hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dl ( pre transfusion value use prognostic factor , transfuse use recombinant erythropoietin growth factor must active bleeding ) . 2 . Liver : AST ≤ 2 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) , serum total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome ) . 3 . Renal : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min use CockcroftGault estimation use formula per protocol . 4 . Pulmonary : FEV1 ≥ 2.0 liter ≥ 75 % predict height age . ( PFTs require patient 50 significant pulmonary smoking history define &gt; 20 pack year history COPD/emphysema ) . 5 . Cardiac : No evidence congestive heart failure , symptom coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction less one year prior entry , serious cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina . Patients 40 previous cardiac disease require negative low probability cardiac stress test cardiac ischemia . Women lactate , childbearing age , negative pregnancy test within two week entry study . Appropriate contraception gender . The patient must competent sign informed consent . CNS : No history cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , central nervous system brain metastasis . Patients previously receive IL2 NOT eligible . Patients HCQ neoadjuvant protocol past clinical indication ARE eligible , patient previously receive CTLA4 and/or PD1/PDL1 antibody . Concomitant second malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer , noninvasive cancer cervical CIS , superficial bladder cancer without local recurrence breast CIS . In patient prior history invasive malignancy , less five year complete remission . Positive serology HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C. Significant comorbid illness uncontrolled diabetes active infection would preclude treatment regimen . Use corticosteroids immunosuppression ( patient take steroid , least 2 week must pass since last dose ) . History inflammatory bowel disease serious autoimmune disease . ( Not include thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis ) . Patients already hydroxychloroquine disorder eligible . Patients organ allograft . Uncontrolled hypertension ( BP &gt; 150/100 mmHg ) . Proteinuria dipstick &gt; 3+ ≥ 2gm/24 hour . Urine protein : creatinine ratio ≥ 1.0 screening . Major surgery , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day start treatment anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Minor surgical procedure , fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior start treatment . Central venous catheter placement permit . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior start treatment . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History tumorrelated serious hemorrhage , bleed diathesis , underlie coagulopathy . History deep venous thrombosis , clinically significant peripheral vascular disease , thrombotic event . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . Individuals know history glucose 6 phosphate deficiency exclude trial ( possible issue HCQ tolerance ) . Patients previously document macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy exclude trial . Baseline EKG QTc &gt; 470 msec ( include subject medication ) . Subjects ventricular pacemaker QT interval measurable eligible casebycase basis .</criteria>
