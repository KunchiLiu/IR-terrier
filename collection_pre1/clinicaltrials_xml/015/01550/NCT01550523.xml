	<brief_summary>This human Phase I trial involve take patient 's tumor cell surgical craniotomy , treat investigational new drug ( antisense molecule ) design shut target surface receptor protein , re-implanting cell , encapsulate small diffusion chamber size dime patient 's abdomen within 24 hour surgery . Loss surface receptor cause tumor cell die process call apoptosis . As tumor cell die , release small particle call exosomes , full tumor antigen . It believe exosomes well presence antisense molecule work together activate immune system tumor slowly diffuse chamber . This combination product therefore serve slow-release antigen depot . Immune cell immediately available activation outside chamber wound create implant tumor cell foreign body ( chamber ) present wound . The wound chamber fortify initial immune response eventually lead activation immune system T cell attack eliminate tumor . By train immune system recognize tumor , patient also protect immune surveillance later tumor growth tumor recur . Compared immunotherapy strategy , treatment marshall native immune system ( specifically antigen present cell , dendritic cell ) rather engineering differentiation immune cell re-injecting . Compared traditional treatment alternative tumor recurrence , include boost radiation chemotherapy , treatment represent potentially great benefit few risk . This combination product serve therapeutic vaccine acceptable safety profile , activate anti-tumor adaptive immune response result radiographic tumor regression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial adaptation continuation previously publish trial , reproduce original study size 12 patient . Modifications previous trial include modify oligodeoxynucleotide sequence treatment initial diagnosis , would occur concomitant standard therapy additional Phase 1 trial continuation rate-limiting toxicity note original Phase 1 arm . For practical purpose , standard Phase 1 dose-escalation study possible current paradigm . Although may identify distinct bioactive byproduct IGF-1R/AS ODN-induced tumor cell apoptosis ( exosomes ) , difficult perform dose escalation typical fashion . Also , antigen concentration affect immune response biphasic manner : little much dampen immune response , even antigen antigen know , typical pharmacologic dose escalation would follow typical pharmacokinetics . For reason , design follow-on Phase 1 arm 32 patient therapy initial surgery 4 cohort 8 patient . We vary chamber number implantation duration four cohort additional Phase 1 arm . When documented increase tumor infiltrate lymphocyte treatment original trial , observation provide preliminary support evidence therapeutic vaccine elicit adaptive immune response . We design Phase 1 arm elucidate immune response quantitative assessment tumor specific T cell well circulate M2 macrophage treatment . The design Phase 1 phase trial allow statistical analysis antigen dose ( number chamber ) time exposure ( chamber dwell time ) either variable may relate toxicity treatment response . A summary treatment paradigm include : Pre-operative plasma leukopheresis , surgery tissue harvest implantation 10 chamber rectus sheath IGF-1R/AS ODN previously report within 24 hour craniotomy plus one chamber contain phosphate buffer saline . Twelve patient treated recurrent disease assess safety treatment . If safety profile acceptable , trial follow accrual 32 patient additional Phase 1 trial continuation approximately 3 year prospectively Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Jefferson Hospital Neuroscience . All patient meet eligibility criterion agree participate study potential candidate therapy . Pre-Operative Preparation - Patients consent plasma leukopheresis least 3 day prior elective craniotomy . The PBMC store subsequent analysis T cell response , presence IL-10-producing M2 macrophage , dendritic cell ( DC ) preparation . ELISPOT assay perform measure T cell response autologous tumor cell allogeneic tumor cell ( U118 tumor lysate ) utilize cross-primed DC ass native anti-glioma immunity acquire immunity treatment . If U118 allogeneic glioma cell elicit CTL response , cell line may serve antigen source future serial vaccination protocol . A pre-operative PET scan baseline compare post-treatment PET scan indicate . Surgery Tumor Cell Retrieval - Craniotomy MRI-based image guide tumor resection perform study patient experience neurosurgeon . All test malignant glioma obtain craniotomy perform Thomas Jefferson University express IGF-1R ( M. Resnicoff , personal communication ) . During resection , viable tumor tissue confirm pathologic examination frozen section , send BL-2 facility disaggregation plat culture . Permanent section analysis include IGF-1R immunostain determine presence IGF-1R . Once cell attach , cell immediately treat IGF-1R/AS ODN . Tumor cell incubate IGF-1R/AS ODN maximum 6 hour 106 cell loaded chamber target maximum 10 chamber prepare . For combination lot production , two additional irradiate chamber 300 ul treat autologous tumor cell send microbiology assessment sterility accord FDA requirement . Greater 5 less 10 chamber score minor protocol violation . Recovery viable cell ground disenrollment protocol . Prior implantation , chamber irradiate 5 Gy X-irradiation previously describe . An additional tumor sample flash-frozen exploratory research objective . At time craniotomy surgeon create abdominal acceptor site subsequent diffusion chamber implantation rectus sheath . This implantation site choose follow reason : ( 1 ) yield objective favorable biological response prior human Phase 1 trial ; ( 2 ) site easily accommodate multiple chamber implantation ; ( 3 ) site elicit strong host response due extent wound , introduction foreign body content , vasculature rectus sheath muscle , favorable inguinal node lymphatic drainage site ; ( 4 ) exposure rectus sheath muscle familiar neurosurgeon commonly perform ventricular-peritoneal shunt . Biodiffusion Chamber Implantation/Explantation - Autologous tumor cell preparation , encapsulation biodiffusion chamber , irradiation , chamber implantation/explantation procedure detailed Standard Operating Procedures Manual IND # 14379 ( SOP 001 ) . Briefly , bedside intensive care unit patient sedate intravenous Midazolam ( Versed , 0.05 mg/kg repeat every 2 - 3 minute adequate sedation maximum dose 0.2mg/kg ) Fentanyl ( Sublimaze , 5mg may repeat every 5 minute maximum dose 20mg ) wound infiltrate 30 cc 0.5 % bupivicaine . With appropriate local anesthesia sedation , wound prepare surgery re-opened rectus sheath 10 chamber implant rectus sheath rectus muscle . The sheath re-approximated 2-0 vicryl suture skin re-approximated 3-0 nylon sutures.The 24 hour period implantation chosen base favorable safety profile promise biological response note previous human Phase 1 trial . Explantation involve process follow day chamber explantation four layer wound closure . Follow-up MRI imaging schedule The MRI study day 28 56 acknowledge do standard care would reflect meaningful clinical data patient receive standard care treatment . The first surveillance MRIs usually obtain around 3 month surgery intervention radiation chemotherapy . After experimental treatment , however , anticipate radiographic response much earlier documented prior human trial . In prior trial , partial complete radiographic response document anywhere 2 27 week treatment . We interpret early response reflection immune-mediated biological response . Follow-up PET imaging schedule PET scan schedule discretion investigator confirm disease progression . Retreatment Subjects consider anticipated subgroup subject initially participate protocol demonstrate immunocompetent response associate objective clinical radiographic improvement induction vaccination . Specifically , serial assessment T cell number associate inflammatory cytokine , interferon , INF-responsive cytokine CXCL9 , CXCL10 , interleukin 6 significantly elevate associated clinical radiographic improvement . Subjects enter retreatment phase protocol follow treatment plan exception pre-operative plasma leukopheresis . Plasma leukopheresis previously collect utilized .</detailed_description>
