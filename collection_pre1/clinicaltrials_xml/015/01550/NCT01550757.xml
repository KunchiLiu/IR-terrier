	<brief_summary>`` Aligning Resources Care Homeless Veterans '' ( ARCH ) study way best organize deliver primary care homeless Veterans . The investigator assess 4 different adaptation PACT primary care model mixed method study include multi-center , randomized-controlled trial embed peer-mentoring within different iteration PACT model , focus group study participant assess satisfaction , treatment engagement self-efficacy within different care model cost-utility analysis determine cost-efficient approach organize care population . Findings study help determine optimal care approach reduce emergency department visit acute hospitalization , increase patient satisfaction , improve chronic disease management . Findings study also substantively add understand health seek behavior care vulnerable/high-risk Veteran population well clinical system design . This project reflect true `` field-based study '' identify optimal feasible approach patient care within current VHA system . Finally , help inform pressing policy issue relevant two identified T-21 priority area : Ending Veteran Homelessness 5 Years Transforming Patient Centered Primary Care model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Primary care , specifically primary care direct homeless Veterans represent opportunity engage individual care , address unmet health need facilitate receipt service necessary exit homelessness . However , unclear best cost-efficient approach provide care . Past research suggest two alternative approach organize deliver primary care homeless Veterans : ( 1 ) structurally realign organize care ( 2 ) embed peer mentoring . The overall purpose research compare contrast outcomes 4 different adaptation combination primary care delivery homeless Veterans within construct Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) model primary care . Objectives : 1 . To test whether peer mentor intervention embed Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) model effective usual-care PACT , separate randomize control trial , within homeless-oriented PACT ( H-PACT ) model , reduce emergency department use hospitalization , improve chronic disease management , increase participation homeless programming . 2 . To compare clinical outcome , service use , treatment engagement , self-efficacy , patient satisfaction participant usual care-PACT without peer mentor H-PACT without peer mentoring . 3 . To determine differential cost cost offset associate PACT model adaptation relation care outcomes homeless Veterans . 4 . To determine whether structurally adapt health care delivery model homeless Veterans ( homeless PACT ) affect treatment engagement , measure utilization service time , compare assignment general population Patient Aligned Care Team primary care assignment . Methods : Substudy # 1- Two multi-center Randomized Controlled Trials : The first comparing PACT PACT+Peer Support ( PACT+P ) ; second compare Homeless-oriented PACT ( H-PACT ) H-PACT+Peer Support ( H-PACT+P ) . Within site conduct 1:1 RCT embed peer support . Substudy # 2- A qualitative study use focus group study participant intervention arm assess perception care , treatment engagement , satisfaction within approach . These finding triangulate survey data conditional logistic regression model address question model perceive receive care within outcome ascribe care approach . This submission occur end Year 2 project specific focus group activity . Substudy # 3- Cost-Utilization Analysis Study : We conduct cost-utilization analysis assess cost offset use CPRS , DSS , PCMM labor map data develop cost model care approach . Substudy # 4- VINCI Data Extraction &amp; Natural Language Processing : Use VINCI analyze PACT H-PACT emergency department visit , include diagnosis , whether substance abuse factor , whether result hospital admission , type aftercare occur ( primary care follow-up , case manager telephone call note , etc . ) ; hospital admission ( diagnosis , length stay , aftercare follow-up ) , ambulatory care utilization ( primary care , mental health , specialty clinic , outpatient substance abuse treatment , homeless program - VRRC ) , include face-to-face remote-based care ( My HealtheVet , telehealth , telephone note ) , medication compliance continuous prescription ( i.e . insulin , antihypertensive ) , chronic disease monitoring management ( blood pressure , diabetes care , hyperlipidemia heart disease diabetic patient ) . Baseline utilization ( prior 6 month ) emergency department , inpatient primary care prior cohort track conduct allow post-hoc stratification patient subgroup base predict risk high use patterning . Status : Enrollment RCT arm conclude . The follow-up period Providence close close early November San Francisco . Focus group complete . The data group transcribe preliminarily analyse , although Drs . Resnik Ellison plan collaboration area strengthen finding . A draft manuscript outline submit upon continued analysis data . In addition non-VA utilization data , Dr. Yoon collect peer time sheet data . She also collaborate Dr. Ellison Smelson look cost benefit peer intervention . The Salt Lake City group ( Co-I Gundlapalli ) prepare deliver finding end November 2014 .</detailed_description>
