	<detailed_description>Colonic adenoma consider pre-cancerous , may change colorectal cancer . Patients high risk develop additional adenoma adenoma find time follow-up colonoscopy . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign either group . If Group 1 , receive metformin ER If Group 2 , receive placebo . Neither study staff know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Study Drug Administration : You take metformin ER/placebo tablet mouth 1 time day food 12-18 month ( usually 12 month sometimes 18 doctor think need ) . This allow time least 1 repeat follow-up colonoscopy . The dose metformin ER increase Week 2 Week 3 . If side effect , dose may lower doctor think need . Study Visit : At 3-12 month 3-18 month start take metformin ER/placebo , another colonoscopy standard tissue collection colonic adenoma ( ) . This tissue use biomarker test . Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw test blood sugar biomarker test . You need fast 8 hour test . Your blood tissue also use research cause colorectal cancer biomarker test . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug 12 month . However , doctor think need , follow-up colonoscopy may schedule either 15 18 month enrollment . If case , continue take drug 18 month . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete study visit . This investigational study . Metformin ER FDA approve commercially available treatment type 2 diabetes . Its use prevent colonic adenomas investigational . Up 128 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
