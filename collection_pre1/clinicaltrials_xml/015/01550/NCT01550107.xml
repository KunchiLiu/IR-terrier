	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia define presence low muscle mass either decreased muscle strength function . It increasingly become significant cause frailty , loss independence physical disability age western population . Recent experimental evidence reveal skeletal muscle particularly susceptible damage molecule result oxidative stress oxidative stress play prominent role development progression sarcopenia . The investigator previously show xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol able abolish vascular oxidative stress improve endothelial function cohort optimally treat chronic heart failure chronic kidney disease . Recently , investigator also show allopurinol improves exercise tolerance time ST-depression optimally treat coronary artery disease , suggest allopurinol could also exert effect ATP and/or oxygen spar mechanism . Therefore , propose randomise double blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial allopurinol patient primary sarcopenia use MR-spectroscopy Flow Mediated Dilatation investigate possible mechanism underlie exciting possibility</brief_summary>
