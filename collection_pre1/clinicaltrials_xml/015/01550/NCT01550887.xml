	<brief_summary>This study main objective investigating impulsivity cocaine crack addict . The investigator main hypothesis different measure ( scale behavioral task , example ) impulsivity may produce distinct outcome , might also differ among cocaine ( sniff ) crack user . Thus , would great value compare measure data often interpret phenomenon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Impulsivity Cocaine Crack Addicts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug dependence characterize sum cognitive , behavioral physiological symptom . Among symptoms lack control one behavior substance use even face significant issue relate . Impulsivity ( express impulsive choice fail behavioral inhibition ) important crucial phase drug dependence development . Both behavioral neurobiological study confirm association impulsivity addictive behavior . Thus high impulsivity level might influence patient ' treatment . Even though , several question matter remain unclear human , difference impulsivity user different form cocaine ( either sniff smoke ) . This kind difference could establish distinct way treatment enable develop good treatment drug user . For study recruit 60 non-treated dependent patient , among 30 cocaine user 30 crack user . These individual select base DSM-IV dependence criterion . The instrument use scale measure compulsion consumption cocaine/crack , pharmacological screening psychotropic drug cognitive evaluation . As impulsivity measure Barratt Impulsivity Scale ( BIS 11 ) , reward discounting questionnaire computer-based behavioral test `` ProgRef v3 '' software . For data analysis impulsivity measure compare behavioral cognitive instrument Pearson 's correlation matrix . An ANOVA also perform verify difference cocaine crack dependent impulsivity compulsion test . When appropriate subsequent Newman-Keuls post-hoc test perform . Significance level adopt 0.05 .</detailed_description>
