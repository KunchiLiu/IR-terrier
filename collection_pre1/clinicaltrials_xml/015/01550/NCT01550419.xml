	<brief_summary>Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) important cause morbidity mortality ventilate critically ill patient specially intensive care unit ( ICU ) . It associate increased duration mechanical ventilation , high death rate increase healthcare cost China . However , VAP preventable many practice demonstrate reduce incidence disease , morbidity still high . So much method prevention need reduce incidence VAP . Statins ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ) present anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory effect besides ability regulate cholesterol composition . So hypothesized early use statin may prevent infection disease VAP . Actually , Two study show statin treatment associate reduce risk pneumonia . However , relationship statin reduce risk pneumonia consistent . After review guideline , meta analysis system review , investigator find advanced age , immune suppression disease medication specially depressed level consciousness risk factor VAP . So investigator assumes early use statin may give u favorable outcome patient coma patient severe disease ( Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation II score &gt; 15 Glasgow coma score &lt; 7 ) . In addition prospective study investigate role statin VAP patient ischemic stroke . The investigator hop study approve relationship statin reduce risk VAP patient ischemic stroke . And improve process , outcome cost critical care well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Atorvastatin Frequency Ventilator-associated Pneumonia Patients With Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one-center , two-arm , randomize , single-blinded , controlled trial . When patient ischemic stroke need mechanic ventilation admit ICU , seal envelop open decide whether patient assign placebo arm atorvastatin arm . During stay ICU , one tablet atorvastatin ( 40mg ) one tablet placebo administer . Atorvastatin placebo administer enteral feeding tube administer orally patient able safely take oral medication . VAP diagnosis accord comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guideline ventilator-associated pneumonia : Diagnosis treatment publish 2008 .</detailed_description>
