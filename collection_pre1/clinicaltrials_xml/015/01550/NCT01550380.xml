	<brief_title>BKM120 Advanced , Metastatic , Recurrent Endometrial Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given mechanism action safety profile tolerability BKM120 ( NVP-BKM120 ) , use agent may provide benefit patient endometrial ovarian cancer . Endometrial ovarian cancer lead cause cancer death woman limit treatment option metastatic refractory disease . Alterations PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway identify many cancer , include endometrial ovarian cancer . Tumors PI3K mutation demonstrate sensitivity compound therefore justify use agent subject endometrial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Therefore use agent cancer patient PI3 kinase pathway activation offer reasonable treatment option . Patients initially treat single agent BKM120 28 day dose 100mg per day . CT response adjudge post BKM120 therapy day 28 . If significant progression CT scan , patient continue BKM120 another two cycle ( 28 day per cycle [ +/- 3 day ] ) . Response assessment do time ( third 28 day cycle ) . If significant progression CT scan , patient continue BKM120 response assessment use standard CT criterion every two cycle ( 28 day per cycle [ +/- 3 day ] ) thereafter . If disease progression observe , patient complete study . Patient see within 30 day end treatment visit .</detailed_description>
