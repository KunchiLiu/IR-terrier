	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study home-based HPV clinic-based Pap screen cervical cancer . It yet know whether home-based screen effective , cost-effective , and/or acceptable clinic-based screen cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-Based Clinic-Based Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare sensitivity specificity cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) two screen approach : - Novel approach : every 3 year high risk-human papillomavirus ( HR-HPV ) testing ( home ) self-collected sample in-clinic cytology HR-HPV positive woman referral colposcopy woman cytology &gt; atypical squamous cell uncertain significance ( ASCUS ) ; repeat HPV test HR-HPV positive cytology negative woman one year ; - Currently recommend approach : woman &lt; 30 : every 3 year in-clinic cytology screening , HPV base triage woman ASCUS referral colposcopy woman squamous intraepithelial lesion ( SIL ) and/or HPV+ ASCUS ; woman 30+ , screen Papanicolaou ( Pap ) HPV , every 2-3 year ( depend previous history ) referral colposcopy HPV 16/18+ cytology &gt; ASCUS ; retesting positive HR-HPV one year . II . Compare two approach respect overall cost-effectiveness acceptability . III . Determine performance cost-effectiveness approach vaccinate unvaccinated woman &lt; 30 . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 arm . GROUP I ( home-based HPV screening ) : Participants collect 2 vaginal specimen use polyester swab . Participants positive HPV test result Pap test . Participants abnormal Pap test undergo standard care Group II . GROUP II ( clinic-based standard care screen ) : Participants undergo Pap test . Participants positive Pap test undergo standard care , include colposcopy , HPV testing , cervical biopsy and/or endocervical curettage ( ECC ) . Participants cervical biopsy show precancerous change require treatment may undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) refer appropriate care .</detailed_description>
