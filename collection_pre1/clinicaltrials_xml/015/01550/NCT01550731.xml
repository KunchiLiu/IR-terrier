	<brief_summary>Millions diverse Veterans live severe chronic illness face complex , ongoing decision . Although VHA forefront patient-centered chronic care , intervention prepare Veterans complex decision-making course chronic illness lacking . This proposal address gap test efficacy novel preparation guide design prepare Veterans communicate surrogate work clinician make complex , ongoing decision . The multi-media guide teach communication preparation skill behavior ( e.g. , choose surrogate ask clinician question ) culturally appropriate , easy-to-use format ( targeted 5th grade read level ) . This study aim provide impetus change paradigm advance care plan policy within VA move beyond documentation end-of-life wish activation Veterans participate ongoing communication value goal - process essential fully realize patient-centered care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preparing Older Veterans With Serious Chronic Illness Decision Making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>4.5 million Veterans age 65 increase number living chronic serious illness . Most old Veterans surrogate decision maker eventually face complex , ongoing decision course chronic illness . These decision difficult , especially 50 % old Veterans limit health literacy . The old paradigm advance care planning focus make decision life- prolonging procedure ( e.g. , resuscitation ) complete advance directive . Yet , old paradigm problematic . The form difficult understand often culturally insensitive . They also fail prepare patient concrete skill , identify one 's value communicate surrogate clinician . The investigator publish new paradigm advance care plan focus instead prepare patient communicate surrogate actively participate clinician make best possible in-the-moment decision . The new paradigm seek ensure complex , ongoing decision base comprehensive set consideration include current clinical context , evolve goal , patient ' surrogate ' need . To effectively , Veterans need prepare . However , easy-to-use , culturally-appropriate preparation guide exist . The investigator create easy-to-understand ( 5th grade read level ) preparation guide base investigator ' new paradigm call PREParation , Activation , Reflection , Engagement advance care plan PREPARE . PREPARE design teach Veterans preparation skill include choose surrogate discus surrogate decision making , clarify personal value specific health state , ask clinician question make informed choice . The aim study : ( 1 ) conduct randomize control trial determine efficacy PREPARE engage old Veterans chronic illness preparation skill behavior ( i.e. , choose surrogate , clarify value , ask clinician question ) ; ( 2 ) determine efficacy PREPARE activate Veterans clinician within clinical encounter ( i.e. , Veterans ask clinician question discuss preparation topic clinician respond ) improve satisfaction decision making ; ( 3 ) obtain input Veterans , surrogate , clinician implementation PREPARE within VA. To achieve Aim 1 , 205 Veterans randomly assign intervention ( PREPARE material plus advance directive ) 205 assign control group ( advance directive ) . Veterans PREPARE arm view easy-to-understand , multi-media PREPARE website study interview take home PREPARE material photo booklet pamphlet format ensure universal access information . The primary outcome Veteran-reported engagement preparation skill behavior 3 6 month , measure standard cognitive behavioral measure . For Aim 2 , activation within clinical encounter measure validated quantitative analysis technique audio-recordings . Satisfaction decision making measure validated , self-reported measure . For Aim 3 , investigator ask Veterans randomize PREPARE arm surrogate clinicians best implement PREPARE within clinical setting . The investigator use standard parametric non-parametric statistical test assess group difference , control demographic variable differ randomization group , adjust potential clustering clinician . For Aims 1 2 investigator assess difference engagement satisfaction race/ethnicity , literacy , gender . The research team extensive experience test literacy-appropriate , multi-media health education material randomize trial . The study team poise test efficacy PREPARE , finding study pave way multi-site effectiveness test widespread VA dissemination PREPARE .</detailed_description>
