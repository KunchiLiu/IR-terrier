	<brief_summary>Background . Headache one common cause consultation primary health care neurology Europe . Cervical muscle tension maintain restriction joint motion suboccipital level , facilitate refer head pain . Objective . To evaluate effectiveness two manual therapy treatment tension-type headache . Methods . A randomized double-blind clinical trial conduct , period 4 week follow-up one month post-treatment . Eighty-four patient tension-type headache assign 4 group ( 3 treatment group 1 control group ) . Treatments include manual therapy suboccipital soft tissue inhibition , occiput-atlas-axis global manipulation , combination technique . Outcome measure : impact headache , disability cause headache , range motion craniocervical junction , frequency intensity headache , associate headache symptom . Results . After 8 week , significant improvement impact headache ( p=0.01 ) , disability ( p=0.001 ) , craniocervical flexion ( p=0.03 ) suboccipital soft tissue inhibition group ; headache impact disability ( p=0.000 ) , pain intensity ( p=0.02 ) craniocervical flexion ( p=0.004 ) extension ( p=0.04 ) occiput-atlas-axis group ; impact ( p=0.002 ) , functional disability ( p=0.000 ) , headache frequency ( p=0.002 ) intensity ( p=0.001 ) , craniocervical flexion ( p=0.008 ) extension ( p=0.003 ) associate headache symptom ( p=0.01 ) combine therapy group , effect size medium large . Conclusions . Occiput-atlas-axis combined therapy group treatment effective suboccipital soft tissue inhibition tension-type headache . The treatment suboccipital soft tissue inhibition , despite produce less significant result , also positive effect different aspect headache .</brief_summary>
