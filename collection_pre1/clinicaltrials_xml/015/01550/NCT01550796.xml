	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine medication along computer program design improve memory mental process help people like tinnitus . The medication investigate , d-cycloserine , developed antibiotic . However , recently , research study show medication may enhance learn memory . The investigator would like determine computer program design improve memory attention enhance medication . In addition , investigator hope learn use program help participant tinnitus well ability remember focus . All research participant receive therapy computer-based program design improve memory attention . Half participant also receive d-cycloserine half participant receive placebo . The placebo sugar pill without active medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Bothersome Tinnitus Using Cognitive Training D-cycloserine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus perception `` ring hiss '' sound absence acoustic stimulus affect 40 million people United States . While exact etiology chronic bothersome tinnitus unknown , current evidence base numerous study neuroimaging result suggest chronic bothersome tinnitus involve central nervous system abnormalities neural network include attention emotional network . These neuroplastic change multiple neural network may offer target treatment chronic bothersome tinnitus . The Brain Fitness Program® ( Posit Science Corporation , San Francisco , California ) cognitive rehabilitation program use treatment schizophrenia geriatric population , show favorable result reorganize aberrant neural network . Preliminary result team show improvement tinnitus severity cognitive function participant chronic bothersome tinnitus use cognitive rehabilitation program . Recent study numerous disorder show d-cycloserine ( DCS ) augments learn therapy program enhance neuroplasticity . In addition , adjuvant use DCS learning therapy find accelerate symptom reduction decrease time-burden need learning therapy . Based belief chronic bothersome tinnitus involve change malleable neural network target therapy DCS enhances neuroplasticity , investigator hypothesize adjuvant DCS cognitive rehabilitation treatment may improve tinnitus severity cognitive deficit associate chronic bothersome tinnitus . This randomized-controlled trial use abbreviate cognitive rehabilitation program give 5 week DCS placebo evaluate impact neuroplasticity-sensitizing drug tinnitus symptom severity cognitive performance among patient chronic bothersome tinnitus . A positive result study numerous implication , include offer new treatment option chronic bothersome tinnitus know side effect limited time commitment cost .</detailed_description>
