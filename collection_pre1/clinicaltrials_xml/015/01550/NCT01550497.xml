	<brief_title>Spinal Stabilization Exercises Low Back Pain Adolescents With Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although idiopathic scoliosis ( IS ) common type scoliosis , study evaluate effectiveness physical therapy exercise manage low back pain ( LBP ) population . Spinal stabilization exercise particular importance adolescent IS due possible reduce spinal stability structural deformity . Spinal stabilization exercise report prevent recurrent episode LBP adult population . However , standardize treatment option recommend LBP adolescent IS , investigator certain spinal stabilization exercise effect patient population . Given high prevalence LBP AIS limit evidence conservative intervention , research effectiveness spinal stabilization exercise warrant . Currently , two common practice manage adolescent IS LBP : 1 ) supervise physical therapy 2 ) one-time treatment follow-up . No study examine two approach superior . This study provide information optimal management LBP AIS . If difference outcomes two approach , one-time visit optimal choice treatment since cost-effective le burdensome family . If outcome favor eight-week supervised physical therapy , specifically spinal stabilization exercise , treatment approach recommend manage LBP AIS .</detailed_description>
