	<brief_title>A Trial 18F-AV-133 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Imaging Differentiate Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) From Other Movement Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early detection monitor neurodegenerative disease include Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , Dementia Lewy Bodies ( DLB ) , dementias movement disorder represent significant unmet medical need . Disease mechanisms gradually become understood , disease-modifying drug emerge target specific molecular pathology underlie disease . Tools accurate early differential diagnosis thus necessary determine appropriate treatment patient minimize inappropriate use potentially harmful treatment . In addition , diagnostic imaging tool expect permit monitoring disease progression thus accelerate test development disease-modifying drug . Furthermore , new image test may useful prognostic tool identify human suffer neurodegenerative disease clinical manifestation become evident .</detailed_description>
