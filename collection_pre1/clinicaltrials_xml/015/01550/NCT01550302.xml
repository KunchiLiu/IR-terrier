	<brief_summary>The investigator want know whether inject numb medication side neck ( also call superficial cervical plexus block ) prevent reduce shoulder pain patient commonly experience lung surgery . The investigator perform injection end surgery subject still general anesthesia wake . The investigator use local anesthetic ( bupivacaine MarcaineÂ® ) routinely use skin infiltration surgical wound . This study randomize single-blind . This mean subject assign chance ( like flip coin ) receive either injection active medication ( bupivacaine ) , injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superficial Cervical Plexus Block Shoulder Pain After Lung Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management follow lung surgery outmost importance . Providing adequate pain control facilitate patient recovery improve lung function , therefore , lead reduce morbidity mortality associate lung surgery . It well-established lung surgery associate significant incisional pain , patient may lead development chronic post-thoracotomy pain syndrome . In addition , many patient report significant shoulder pain often resistant increase epidural infusion intravenous opioid therapy . The incidence shoulder pain varies study study estimate anywhere 41 % 97 % . Although cause shoulder pain well understood , therapy available treatment shoulder pain include acetaminophen , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , interscalene brachial plexus stellate ganglion block . However , currently available therapy potentially significant side-effects . The investigator aware study evaluate effectiveness superficial cervical plexus block reduce prevent shoulder pain follow thoracotomy thoracoscopic surgery . The superficial cervical plexus block minimal risk procedure equivalent IV start . The primary aim study compare effect superficial cervical plexus block add thoracic epidural analgesia intravenous patient control analgesia ( PCA ) standard thoracic epidural analgesia PCA use institution incidence shoulder pain . Subjects participate study receive standard clinical care addition follow research procedure : - Intra-operative block : injection bupivacaine side neck end surgery subject still general anesthesia injection control group . If subject assign receive injection , investigator use small needle similar one use numb skin IV start . There single needle stick side neck ( side lung surgery ) injection 15 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine skin . Regardless whether subject get injection , he/she receive standard clinical care . - Post-lung surgery pain assessment : investigator ask subject rate pain incision site , chest tube site shoulder rest movement 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 48 hour lung surgery . The investigator also ask subject side-effects may associate standard narcotic pain medication . The investigator collect follow data medical record include : - Presence absence shoulder pain - The amount pain medicine ( narcotic ) need treat subject 's pain 24 48 hour lung surgery - The presence side-effects narcotic pain medication - Blood pressure , heart rate , EKG oxygen level available order evaluate improve shoulder pain less narcotic use additional beneficial effect Subjects eligible age 18-75 year undergo lung surgery . Subjects eligible non-English speaking , previous lung surgery , allergic bupivacaine , history chronic pain take pain medication long time , already shoulder pain .</detailed_description>
