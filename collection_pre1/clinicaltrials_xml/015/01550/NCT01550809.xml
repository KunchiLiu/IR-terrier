	<brief_title>New Strategies Postprandial Glycemic Control Using Insulin Pump Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last 30 year , even development new glucose monitoring technique availability new insulin preparation physiological profile , SC continuous administration system still able universal , efficient safe system able achieve near-normalization glucose level diabetic patient . Indeed , develop country , one third diabetic patient meet criterion good metabolic control , i.e . glycosylated haemoglobin &lt; 7 % . During past 10-15 year , exponentially increase intrusion technology diabetes care expectation improve metabolic control make life easy patient diabetes . In last year , tool develop aid patient prandial bolus decision-making process `` bolus advisor '' , implement insulin pump recently new generation glucometers . Currently , availability continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) open two scenario : 1 . `` Open-loop control strategy '' . In short/mid term CGM may help implementation effective strategy insulin treatment , especially CSII treat patient , development smarter pump ( `` sensor augmented pump '' use information CGM tune insulin infusion ) . 2 . `` Closed-loop control strategy '' . In long term , CGM may allow automate glucose control ( so-called artificial pancreas ) . The artificial pancreas would represent ideal solution attainment therapeutic goal need prevent chronic complication diabetes . Indeed , last two decade , technological progress fuel research closed-loop glucose control system aim effective treatment diabetic subject . Preliminary study use off-the-shelf insulin pump continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) sensor suggest research setting , closed-loop system automatically dispense insulin achieve good glucose control open-loop system people take dose decision . Such promising result prompt Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) push research forward launch Artificial Pancreas Project 2006 . Also , US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) designate artificial pancreas priority within Critical Path Initiative . However , due complexity , prototypes far develop test controlled clinical setting . Among problem related glycemic closed-loop control , management postprandial glycaemic excursion key issue future artificial pancreas . Indeed , meal-induced perturbation glucose control one major problem counteract main challenge find current clinical validation exist prototype closed-loop glycemic control system . The first significant clinical result regard fully automate close loop fast condition come Medtronic Inc. demonstrate feasibility fully automate close loop system 10 adult type 1 diabetes mellitus , use external pump ( CSII ) , sensor continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) , control algorithm call ePID . This algorithm consist classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller plus insulin on-board feedback . Since , several initial clinical trial closed-loop control make prove feasibility control algorithms like Model Predictive Control ( MPC ) . MPC obtain positive result type 1 diabetic patient also Intensive Care Units . Different approach suggest deal meal disturbances controller . Fully closed-loop system information meal size time give system show poor performance , postprandial glucose high post-meal nadir glucose low desire . This promoted less-ambitious approach , meal announce system generate feed-forward action like instance prandial insulin bolus ( semi closed-loop ) . Hybrid approach also propose , percentage prandial bolus apply ( 'priming bolus ' ) rest leave closed-loop controller . Clinical study demonstrate efficacy solution reduce postprandial excursion closed-loop control versus fully closed-loop system , show first generation artificial pancreas require announcement meal prim insulin bolus . However , despite use meal announcement , main challenge control algorithm still avoidance overcorrection . An aggressive-enough tuning low post-prandial glucose peak may cause accumulation insulin produce late hypoglycemia . This impose consideration constraint residual insulin activity ( insulin-on-board ) PID MPC-based system . However , despite inclusion constraint , clinical result meal PID MPC yet satisfactory . Interval technique show particularly suitable deal constraint uncertainty , lead robust solution potentially reduce risk hypoglycaemia maintain good performance . These technique first introduce Bondia et al 2009 , propose set-inversion-based algorithm calculation meal-related insulin . This algorithm compute feasible set insulin profile fulfill give constraint postprandial glycemia , accord patient 's prediction model . In particular , physiological constraint apply use postmeal guideline International Diabetes Federation aim hypoglycemia two-hour glucose 140 mg/dL , 5-hour time horizon . A refined algorithm present Revert et al 2009 , allow determination optimal insulin administration mode ( standard , square , dual-wave temporal basal decrement/iBolus ) . In work , silico validation use FDA-accepted UVA simulator test control algorithm perform . Results study demonstrated effectiveness strategy , include challenge meal high carbohydrate content . To date , prim prandial bolus context semi-automated glucose control compute base patient 's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio , currently do 'standard ' CSII therapy . In latter , bolus insulin infuse patient 's basal insulin rate , usually follow one three available choice : 1 ) simple bolus ( insulin dose administer bolus , i.e . like pen syringe ) ; 2 ) dual wave bolus ( percentage insulin dose administer bolus , remain insulin infuse square wave pre-specified time interval follow meal ) ; 3 ) square wave bolus ( insulin dose administer square wave ) . However , mention study Revert et al . demonstrate 'in silico ' ( i.e . mean FDA-accepted computer simulator ) , coordinate action basal bolus insulin require maintain blood glucose physiological range , postprandial state . In particular , bolus great standard one , parallel temporary reduction basal insulin infusion rate ( refer iBolus , may consider generalization superbolus concept introduce Walsh et al . need , especially meals high carbohydrate content . This study plan validate new methodology prandial insulin administration , expect confirm hypothesis set-inversion technique may apply SAP-CSII therapy . Of note , strategy would represent first attempt develop non-heuristic tool mealtime insulin dose . It could implement closed-loop strategy glycemic control also open-loop strategy advance bolus advisor new generation insulin pump . Primary objective : In type 1 DM subject treat CSII , assessment clinical validation new algorithm optimization postprandial glucose control , iBolus ( CGM-based prandial insulin administration ) comparison standard bolus ( tBolus ) .</detailed_description>
