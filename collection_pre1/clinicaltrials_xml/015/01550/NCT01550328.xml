	<brief_title>Bias Source Signal SCOUT DS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In process calibrate multiple SCOUT DS unit , consistent inter-device score difference find . These difference could create bias measurement Diabetes Risk score ( DRS ) human subject . This study intend examine two various subsystem SCOUT DS determine whether either might capable introduce bias measurement , ultimate aim eliminate inter-device measurement variation . The test human subject trial necessary determine whether variability performance device subsystems actually affect DRS score real world setting . The trial prospective , single site , investigational trial . The trial utilize four SCOUT DS device . Subjects report investigative site multiple visit . The number visit vary three seven visit .</detailed_description>
