	<brief_summary>Even though main risk factor development chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) smoke less one third smoker clinically manifest COPD develop . The disease progressive nature high disability mortality especially final stage make plausible detect disease early possible thus allow early intervention . Major intervention trial COPD , `` Towards Revolution COPD Health '' ( TORCH ) , `` Investigating New Standards Prophylaxis Reducing Exacerbations '' ( INSPIRE ) , `` Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts Function Tiotropium '' ( UPLIFT ) recently show beneficial impact intervention large patient treat earlier stage disease development . Till tool early diagnosis early intervention could use global scale spirometry even though symptom deprivation quality life ( QoL ) precede clinically relevant spirometric change . So need new simple tool would allow detection patient early stage COPD . So aim study development diagnostic tool early detection COPD , even significant change spirometry .</brief_summary>
