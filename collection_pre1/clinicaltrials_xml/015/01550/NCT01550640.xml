	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Even nowadays still significant risk insufficient depth anesthesia Cesarean delivery ( CD ) general anesthesia ( GA ) . The main reason comparison surgery lack opioid administration due risk newborn respiratory depression . Opioids easily cross placental barrier fetus circulation may cause depression respiration deteriorate overall newborn postpartum adaptation . This present main reason accord contemporary recommendation use opioids CD restrict time fetus delivery , give far navel wort ligation . Not cause depression newborn premedication GA usually also omit . The beginning GA common surgical operation usually accompany decrease systemic blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) . However , CD investigator face increase BP HR due stress reaction mother period fetus delivery full anesthesia application , include opioids . Generally , insufficient depth anesthesia ( assessed patient 's recollection ) report less 1 % case , increase 50 % GA CD . However , appraisal marginalize much frequent case insufficient depth GA accompany exaggerated autonomic reaction pain , especially increase systemic BP heart rate reaction egestion catecholamine , total amnesia surgery retain . In CD type anesthesia insufficiency report 12-26 % patient ! Current trend CD anesthesia unequivocally prefers use regional technique ; GA remain indicated emergency situation mainly case stress reaction mother tend much high elective procedure . An independent remarkable risk factor pregnant woman hypertension , chronic gestational include preeclampsia . This condition preoperatively mostly hardly insufficiently control hypertension may get dramatically bad first phase CD , blood pressure due uncontrolled stress reaction enormously rise elevate intracranial pressure high risk hemorrhagic stroke - life threaten complication . Unfortunately possibilities influence mother 's stress response intubation laparotomy without increase risk newborn depression . In absence anesthetic cross placental barrier , possibility use ultra-short act anesthetic eliminate fetus circulation delivery . An important role might play remifentanil - µ-receptor agonist rapid onset ultra-short activity ( biological half-life 3-10 min. ) . It 's major advantage , beside fast onset , also prompt organ independent elimination . HYPOTHESIS Bolus administration ultra-short act synthetic µ-opioid receptor agonist , remifentanil , mother hypertension/preeclampsia induction general anesthesia attenuate egestion stress catecholamine development stress autonomic reaction response laryngoscopy , intubation subsequent laparotomy CD . The remifentanil administration thus suppress hypertensive tachycardiac increase initial period CD , without negative influence newborn postpartum adaptation , mainly breathe . On contrary prevention uteroplacental blood flow reduction improve postpartum adaptation newborn . The project also give pilot data , genetic polymorphism target gene , important remifentanil pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic , influence Czech population drug efficacy safety . As extrapolated result investigator expect reduction complication attribute severe BP increase , especially hemorrhagic stroke . The remifentanil administration negative influence newborn , especially postnatal adaptation breathing activity . Prevention uteroplacental insufficiency response hypertension tachycardia may even lead good newborn status . AIMS The aim project : 1 . To assess newborn postnatal adaptation cesarean delivery general anesthesia remifentanil bolus 1 µg/kg prior induction general anesthesia 2 . To demonstrate stabilize influence remifentanil circulation depth anesthesia patient hypertension/preeclampsia time fetus delivery CD 3 . To assess influence individual hereditary variability MDR1 ( multidrug resistance gene 1 ) PXR ( pregnane X receptor ) RMF pharmacodynamics . 4 . To assess influence individual genetic variability µ-opioid receptor gene drug effect newborn . Extrapolated result reduction complication mother associate serious increase systemic blood pressure improve postpartum newborn adaptation . Patients hypertension/preeclampsia high risk insufficient depth anesthesia CD may lead uncontrolled hypertension risk intracranial bleeding . To avoid complication represent one current obstetrician anesthesia priority . Optimal introduction GA clinical situation yet identify . METHODS AND RESEARCH SAMPLE Type study : prospective , randomize , double-blinded assessment neonatal adaptation single-blinded evaluation haemodynamic change . Patient file : 160 pregnant woman undergo CD GA ; 80 patient hypertension/preeclampsia - 40 REMIFENTANIL group 40 STANDARD ( placebo ) group ; 80 patient without hypertension/preeclampsia - 40 REMIFENTANIL group 40 STANDARD ( placebo ) group . Randomization : Will perform CD use envelope method . Randomization preparation appropriate study bolus ( remifentanil 1 µg/kg ) perform supervise anesthesiologist . The randomization neonatologist broken case medical complication , e.g . respiratory depression infant occur opioid antagonist may administer . Supervising anesthesiologist otherwise interfere course CD evaluation data . Conduct anesthesia : Thirty second prior GA induction bolus study drug solution give intravenously . Afterwards anesthesia conduct standard way : induction GA combination thiopentone 5 mg/kg suxamethonium 1.25 mg/kg ; subsequent intubation inhalation oxygen/nitrous oxide ( 1:1 ) sevoflurane 0.7 % . Following intubation neuromuscular relaxant Atracurium administer 0.35 mg/kg . After delivery newborn umbilical cord clamp opioid analgesia sufentanil 0.3-0.5 µg/kg inhalation oxygen/nitrous oxide ( 2:3 ) + sevoflurane 0.7-1.0 % administer . If require , additional bolus sufentanil 10 µg intravenously give . Intraoperative monitoring : All patient monitor accord guideline respect risk associate hypertension/preeclampsia GA CD - ECG ( include V4-5 thoracic lead , ST analysis ) , SatO2 , ETCO2 , % oxygen , % volatile anesthetic , ventilation parameter ( PIP , MV , TV , F ) . For evaluation anesthesia depth continuous bispectral EEG analysis ( BIS ) sympathetic skin reflex response ( SSRR ) use . BIS electrophysiological method reflect inability perceive stimulus environment use mathematical analysis EEG curve ; SSRR unique method measure change skin conductivity high sensitivity delay 1-2 sec . reflect immediate change sympathetic system nociceptive stimulus ( Stress Detector ; Med-Storm , Norway ) . DATA COLLECTION Demographics : age , height , weight , BMI , gestational age , previous pregnancy , associate medical condition . Preoperative laboratory value ( haematology , liver kidney function , total protein ) . Hemodynamics ( BP , MAP , HR , ST analysis ) , ventilation ( MV , SatO2 , ETCO2 ) , depth anaesthesia ( BIS , SSRR ) . Time course CD ( study drug administration , induction GA , intubation , begin surgery , hysterotomy , delivery ) . Measurement blood loss , complication . Clinical examination assessment newborn status ( Apgar score + acid-base measurement umbilical cord , clinical evaluation score ) . Biological material sample To assess genotype MDR1 gene PXR ( Pregnane X Receptor ) 8 ml umbilical blood 8 ml venous blood mother collect . Pharmacogenomic analysis : Validated method PXR MDR1 polymorphism analysis available workplace . In gene five polymorphism possible functional impact analyze every sample . Method assessment opioid receptor polymorphism ( A118G ) implement first year study . EVALUATION Level anesthesia depth evaluate BIS SSRR value hemodynamic response intubation incision , especially change BP ( systolic , diastolic , mean ) heart rate . Evaluation newborn status assess Apgar score acid-basis measurement umbilical cord blood clinical assessment score perform experienced neonatologist .</detailed_description>
