	<detailed_description>Background Acute rheumatic Fever ( ARF ) result autoimmune response due molecular mimicry M-protein group A β-hemolytic streptococci ( GABHS ) cell membrane cardiac myosin , may lead recurrent sustain inflammation Rheumatic Heart Disease ( RHD ) ( 1 ) . RHD report affect 15 million people worldwide remain major contributor morbidity premature death work age population develop country ( 2 ) . Socioeconomic determinant poverty , overcrowd , malnutrition relate RHD . The prevalence ARF RHD seem particularly high Southeast Asia , Western Pacific Africa ( 3 ) . Whereas heart murmur detect clinical examination may indicate clinically manifest RHD , echocardiographic screen reveal ten time high prevalence rate RHD among schoolchildren ( 4 ) may help diagnose RHD early , `` clinically silent '' stage . Patients past medical history ARF RHD recommend secondary prevention regular oral intravenous administration penicillin continue early adulthood . Even though preventive measure penicillin inexpensive efficient , strategy difficult effectuate develop country limit access health care resource . A recent study prove enrol patient ARF RHD registry close follow-up increase compliance treatment thus help reduce cardiovascular sequela associate disease progression ( 5 ) . The prevalence RHD among schoolchildren urban rural area Nepal largely unknown , risk factor associate prognosis disease receive medical care various stage disease diagnosis need determine . Moreover , impact screen use echocardiography , detect RHD earlier , `` clinically silent '' stage RHD health resource utilization determine . Objective Three main inter-related objective pursue three phase study : In first phase use cross sectional approach , prevalence clinical subclinical RHD investigate among representative sample schoolchildren public private school urban rural area . In second phase , use cohort study approach among child diagnose different stage RHD , clinical outcome regular medical surveillance assess , clinical social risk factor associate prognosis disease receive medical care various stage disease diagnosis determine . The third phase integrate prevalence rate phase 1 clinical outcome phase 2 mathematical model assess impact screen RHD treatment quality life health resource utilization . Methods The project employ three type study design perform sequential phase : cross sectional study ( part 1 ) , longitudinal cohort study ( part 2 ) analysis impact screening , secondary prevention treatment health resource utilization ( part 3 ) . 1 . Part 1 : Cross-Sectional Survey Schoolchildren age 5-15 year screen select school Southeast area Nepal . 2 . Part 2 : Longitudinal Cohort Study Those child document history ARF and/or RHD include prospective registry receive secondary prevention follow regular basis . 3 . Part 3 : Impact Screening Treatment RHD The third phase integrate prevalence rate phase 1 clinical outcome phase 2 mathematical model assess impact screen RHD treatment health resource utilization .</detailed_description>
