	<brief_title>Identifying Unique Scent Signature Lung Cancer Through Body Odor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among cancer harm population , lung cancer lethal type , responsible 1.3 million death per year worldwide , 28 % cancer deaths.The 5 year survival rate low , 15 % . Diagnosis treatment lung cancer early stage could increase 5-year-survival rate 3-4 fold potential cure . Therefore , effort make develop new sensitive specify screening tool detect lung cancer ' early stage . A new emerge strategy early detection lung cancer base recognition tumor metabolic signature , identification specific biomarkers disease , volatile organic compound ( VOC ) . Research demonstrate compound release cancerous tissue early stage disease , find different bodily secretion . The subject , lung cancer patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient , would give cotton T-shirts instruction wear without previously apply deodorant similar personal hygiene product . Then , shirt would collect 8 piece ( size:1cm*3cm armpit area ) would cut one . Dogs study would train `` Dogs People '' association . In initial stage , 40 mixed breed dog 3-4 Springer spaniel would expose sweat sample collect cancer patient order get acquaint scent . Then , would demand locate box contain T-shirt sample take cancer patient , decoy box hold naïve T-shirts . Every sequence include 4 box different ratio specimen ( time different number box contain sample take cancer patient , 0,1,2,3 4 rest box would contain naïve T-shirts ) . The dog would mark specimen sit next relevant box ( ignore decoy box sniff identify irrelevant ) . The prominent 8-9 dog would continue experiment phase . Each training course would last 5-10 minute 8 successful identification , depend train dog need . Dogs would reward treat ( dog biscuit ) play time , depend dog ' nature . In experimental phase , decoy box would hold sweat sample collect COPD patient instead naïve T-shirts . The dog would ask locate box contain T-shirt sample take lung cancer patient , decoy box . Every sequence include 4 box different ratio specimen ( time different number box contain sample take cancer patient , 0,1,2,3 4 rest box would contain sample collect COPD patient ) . The dog would mark specimen sit next relevant box ( ignore decoy box sniff identify irrelevant ) . The trainer would oblivious target ' location .</detailed_description>
