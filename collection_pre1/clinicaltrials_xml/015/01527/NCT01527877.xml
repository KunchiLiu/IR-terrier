	<brief_title>Study BKM120 Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One promising approach treatment cancer inhibition modulate crucial signal transduction pathway PI3K-Akt-mTOR . Several PI3K inhibitor test clinical trial cancer treatment head neck cancer yet . BKM120 specific Pan-class I PI3K inhibitor . We suggest multicenter single arm phase II study determine anti-tumor effect BKM120 patient recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN fail prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen .</detailed_description>
