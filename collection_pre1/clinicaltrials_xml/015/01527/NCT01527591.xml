	<brief_title>Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 13 ( Prevnar13Â® ) Children Who Are Solid Organ Transplant Recipients ( SOT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine booster dose 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) safe result measurable durable immunologic response pneumococcal subtypes present vaccine solid organ transplant recipient ( SOT ) child . Pneumococcal infection amongst common infection see immunocompromised child . Infection Streptococcus pneumoniae one frequently observe infection immunocompromised child . Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV ) license U.S. 40 year . In contrast , pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunogenic efficacious normal infant child , offer hope reduce pneumococcal infection immunocompromised child . However , conjugate pneumococcal vaccine protect limit number 90 pneumococcal serotypes . It reasonable anticipate introduction PCV13 may help reduce chance severely immunocompromised child get pneumococcal infection . Many child previously immunize full series 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine . These child benefit additional dose new 13-valent vaccine . The degree SOT-recipient child protect prior immunization responsive new immunization still largely undefined . This study aim expand knowledge regard safety immunogenicity PCV13 immunization grow vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
