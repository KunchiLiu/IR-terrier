	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize control trial determine effectiveness treat cartilage lesion find knee arthroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ChAMP ( Chondral Lesions And Meniscus Procedures ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normal wear-and-tear knee cause tissue , cartilage , knee soften time form chondral lesion . Worn cartilage often find knee surgery condition . Typically , surgeon remove worn cartilage find use procedure call debridement . However , investigator know surgically treat worn cartilage well leave tissue untreated , necessary compare two . Patients find worn cartilage arthroscopy , randomly assign either receive treatment ( debridement ) non-treatment ( observation ) cartilage . Patients without worn cartilage also include study observe postoperatively . The primary objective study examine effect treatment worn cartilage ( versus non-treatment worn cartilage versus patient without worn cartilage ) , self-reported knee pain follow arthroscopic meniscectomy use double-blinded randomize controlled trial design . Secondary objective study include examine effect treat worn cartilage outcome ( subjective knee general health score knee measurement include range motion , presence effusion quadriceps circumference ) also calculate intra-operative cost associate treatment , include amount time instrument need debridement .</detailed_description>
