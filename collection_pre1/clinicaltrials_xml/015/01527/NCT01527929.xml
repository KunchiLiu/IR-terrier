	<detailed_description>The study consist screen phase , registration , cabazitaxel administration start within 5 business day registration , 21-day study treatment cycle . Cycle length may extend maximum 14 additional day case unresolved toxicity . Patients continue receive treatment experience , unacceptable toxicities/Adverse Events , disease progression , withdraw consent , investigator decides discontinue patient , subsequent 30 day follow-up study cut-off , whichever come first . Patients may continue treat long benefit study treatment meet study withdrawn criterion .</detailed_description>
