	<detailed_description>Although burden sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) affect individual significant , study examine influence SCA measure physical function exercise capacity . Moreover , physiologic basis poor physical functioning child SCA unknown study extensively . The purpose proposal use cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) gain comprehensive understanding exercise capacity , measure physical function , child young adult SCA . The specific aim project : 1 ) Measure peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , reference standard exercise capacity , child young adult SCA classify primary pathophysiologic contributor decrease exercise capacity , 2 ) Examine acute inflammatory response , measure increase soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule ( sVCAM ) activity , subject undergoing CPET . These aim perform 60 subject SCA 30 match control without SCA . In secondary analysis , also study impact baseline exercise capacity inflammatory response exercise short long-term disease relate morbidity . This study essential address several area exercise capacity , include physiologic contributor exercise limitation remain fundamental knowledge gap SCA .</detailed_description>
