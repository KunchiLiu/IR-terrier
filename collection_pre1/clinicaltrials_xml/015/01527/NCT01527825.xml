	<detailed_description>Determining contribution influenza early childhood morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa potential prevent influenza disease vaccination may contribute reduce childhood death ; since influenza illness vaccine preventable disease vaccine develop , license available reasonable cost . Unfortunately , infant high risk serious disease 6 month age , trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) poorly immunogenic license . As pregnant woman also increase risk serious illness ( 3.3-5.5 fold hospitalization influenza-associated acute cardio-respiratory illness ) influenza infection , one strategy prevent complication influenza pregnant woman young infant maternal TIV immunization , recommend WHO . This could result direct protection woman protection young infant consequent transplacental transfer TIV induce antibody . Barriers administration vaccine pregnancy include lack information effectiveness concern safety probably explain virtual non-existent use TIV pregnant woman low-middle income country , include South Africa . Although national campaign influenza vaccination pregnant woman South Africa 2010 due concern continue circulation H1N1-2009pdm influenza virus , uptake vaccine remain poor . TIV immunization pregnant woman still provide standard care pregnant woman attend antenatal-clinics South Africa , part absence data African set regard risk-benefit ratio . The immunogenicity efficacy TIV HIV-infected adult recently document African setting . This placebo-controlled , community-based randomize , placebo control trial , conduct Themba Lethu HIV clinic , Helen Joseph hospital , report TIV associate 75 % reduction influenza-confirmed illness . The result study also confirm safety TIV among African HIV-infected adult . The study , however , include 7 woman pregnant . In addition difference solicit adverse event rate , also difference either cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) cell count change HIV viral control antiretroviral treatment TIV vaccinee compare placebo recipient . This allayed previous concern regard potential negative effect TIV center around observed transient increase HIV-1 viral load , even HIV infect individual ART virologically suppress ( viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml ) . Decreases CD4+ lymphocyte count also observe HIV-infected individual post TIV vaccination . These change , however , even past study infrequent ( 4-18 % ) resolve later time-points consider clinically non-significant . Only recently data become available another low-income country ( Bangladesh ) benefit maternal TIV vaccination demonstrate 63 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 5 85 ) reduction laboratory-confirmed influenza illness infant 24 week age child bear mother vaccinate TIV 36 % reduction clinical illness vaccinate mother . There , however , study effectiveness maternal immunization TIV influenza- associate morbidity mortality either mother infant African setting . Much influenza virus associate morbidity mortality may due synergistic lethality influenza bacterial pathogen lead pneumonia well viral co-infections . Superimposed bacterial infection , especially Streptococcus pneumoniae patient treat antibiotic , Staphylococcus aureus , contribute large proportion ( 28-65 % ) pneumonia death associate influenza illness pandemic . Unpublished data Bangladeshi study show infants mother receive TIV ( pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , 7 valent ( PCV7 ) give infant ) well protect acquisition pneumococcal carriage influenza season infant TIV-unimmunized mother . No data African setting available support refute observation Bangladesh . As introduction pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) low-income country priority Global Alliance Vaccines Immunization ( GAVI ) , 7 African country already approve , many others follow , introduce PCV within next five year . Despite encouraging result maternal immunization Bangladesh , preliminary data support TIV efficacious mainly HIV-infected non-pregnant adult , data need advocate routine use TIV pregnancy setting high prevalence HIV . Reasons include impact maternal HIV kinetics TIV induce transplacental antibody transfer derive available data . This important primary focus proposal , major potential public health benefit maternal TIV vaccination , target protection young infant . HIV infection know decrease placental integrity lower antibody level fetus newborn . Furthermore , maternal hypergamma-globulinemia characteristic HIV-infection may associate decreased neonatal antibody level . This paradox explain limited number placental antibody receptor , result immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies compete available receptor thereby decrease vaccine-specific antibody transport . Preterm birth increase HIV , chronic maternal disease malnutrition . Transfer maternal antibody gestational age dependant , may affect maternal immunization sub-Saharan Africa condition common . In 2011 , two Maternal influenza vaccination trial conduct pregnant woman Soweto community , one HIV-infected woman , HIV-uninfected woman . In trial ( HREC reference number 101106 101107 ) immunogenicity single dose TIV administer 20 36 week gestation investigate . HIV-uninfected woman show good response one month post vaccination 85.3 % , 92.7 % 98.5 % woman seroprotective level antibody vaccine strain , H3N2 , H1N1 B respectively , however , HIV-infected woman show inferior response vaccination . The CD4+ cell count baseline ( prior vaccination ) affect immunological response mount HIV-infected woman : 12.5 % , 12.5 % 62.5 % woman CD4+ cell count &lt; 200 , 50 % , 66.7 % 77.8 % woman CD4+ count ≥500 seroprotective level vaccine strain , H3N2 , H1N1 B respectively , one month post receipt single-dose TIV . The overall aim project evaluate safety immunogenicity 3 different dose option TIV vaccination HIV-infected pregnant woman : single dose , double dose ( time point ) two-doses ( 1 month apart )</detailed_description>
