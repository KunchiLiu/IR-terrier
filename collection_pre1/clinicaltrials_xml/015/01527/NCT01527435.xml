	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate fact 20 milligram per day oral Zeaxanthin supplement patient Choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) exudative age relate macular degeneration ( ARMD ) undergo combination therapy intravitreal Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , intravitreal Dexamethasone PDT laser photocoagulation improve anatomic visual outcome compare patient receive oral Zeaxanthin . Study patient take AREDS ( PreserVision ) multivitamins ( Centrum Silver ) ; addition one-half patient receive 20mg oral Zeaxanthin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition 20mg/Day Zeaxanthin Triple Therapy Treatment Options Age Related Macular Degeneration ( ARMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One current treatment choroidal neovascularization exudative age relate macular degeneration ( ARMD ) involve combination laser photocoagulation ( PDT ) injection anti-inflammatory ( Dexamethasone ) anti-angiogenic ( Bevacizumab ) . This combination therapy design stabilize vision , improve vision select case reduce total number treatment cycle overall compare method treatment presently use . Many retinal physician treat exudative ARMD ocular injection every 4 week number year . Combination therapy reduce number treatment cycle le 3 many patient ; preliminary study , patient take 20 milligram dietary oral zeaxanthin require even less treatment cycle achieve stability . In trial , variable oral consumption 20 milligram zeaxanthin daily take half patient randomize group . The remain half patient still undergo combination therapy , without take 20 milligrams oral dietary Zeaxanthin . Zeazanthin find many food low dos zeazanthin commonly add many multivitamin already market . All product Zeazanthin constituent , include EyePromise Ten , excellent safety profile side effect adverse event report thus far supplement . Zeazanthin many eye supplement study NEI , National Eye Institute , part AREDS-2 study look benefit Lutein , Zeazanthin Omega 3 Fish Oils AMD progression . The patient take 20 milligram day Zeazanthin . The United States global safety organization establish ADI ( acceptable daily intake ) 2 mg/kg body weight/day Zeazanthin . This equate 155 mg per day 177 pound person . Millions dose EyePromise Ten take without side effect . The new part trial , take 20 milligram Zeazanthin combine medical injection laser treatment . Zeazanthin one two pigment obtain diet deposit macula give yellow color . While obtain diet retina accumulate 1000 time higher level anywhere else body . Numerous scientific clinical trial suggest critical protection retina reduce risk progression age relate macular degeneration .</detailed_description>
