	<detailed_description>This repeat measure trial randomization intervention cross design quantify daily walk physical activity level child cerebral palsy ( CP ) without use solid ankle foot orthotic ( SAFO ) . Current orthotic management guideline base primarily evidence SAFO use positively impact body function structure clinic lab base observation activity movement . Prior research determine wear SAFO improve different aspect gait mobility ( stride step length , single limb stance , velocity ) child CP . However , study limit small sample size , lack comparison group , inconsistency orthotic fabrication , lack clear simple outcome measure and/or randomize control design . No prior study evaluate effect SAFO use activity performance outcomes . The purpose study determine effect wear wear current SAFO child 's walking ability , participation common life activity , gait . Children age 2 - &lt; 10 year bilateral cerebral palsy , dynamic equinus gait deformity , wear bilateral SAFOs fabricate Cascade DAFO approach participation . Enrolled child randomly assign either wear wear SAFOs 14 day intervention period . After period , child opposite second 14 day intervention period . Children attend three study visit ; enrollment , first intervention period , second intervention period . At first visit , parent child ( applicable ) complete questionnaire regard participation common life activity prior 7 day , complete walk evaluation . Children wear StepWatch accelerometer intervention period , count number step child take time step take . After second intervention period complete , child 's participation research study complete . One home visit conduct end intervention period , questionnaire repeat , StepWatch download and/or - calibrate per protocol .</detailed_description>
