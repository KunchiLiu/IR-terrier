	<brief_title>Entolimod Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CBLB502 ( entolimod ) patient advance cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary evidence efficacy CBLB502 patient advance cancer . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile CBLB502 patient advance cancer . III . To characterize effect , , intramuscular subcutaneous CBLB502 QTcB . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate pre-treatment tissue expression toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) clinical activity ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] tumor response ) PD response ( measure cytokine level ) CBLB502 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive entolimod intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
