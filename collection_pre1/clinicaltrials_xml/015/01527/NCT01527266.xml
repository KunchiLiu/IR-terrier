	<brief_summary>Several study report carbohydrate ( CHO ) ingestion improve performance exercise short duration ( le 60 min ) . However , apparent metabolic explanation observation endogenous CHO store limit factor short duration exercise . Nonetheless , several group attempt investigate CHO administration short duration exercise vary result . When CHO administer intravenously , performance effect observe despite great plasma glucose availability ( 5 ) . Therefore , suggest exercise short duration , exogenous CHO ingestion may exert ergogenic effect action central nervous system , possibly mediate glucose receptor mouth . The latter investigated use CHO-mouth rinse , whereby CHO solution spat remove influence gut exogenous CHO oxidation performance . Using rinse , study demonstrate result ( 5 , 16 ) , ( 1 , 19 ) improvement short duration exercise performance compare placebo . The discrepancy finding may due test subject feed ( 1 ) fasted-state ( 5 ) , liver glycogen store may compromise . However , study test subject fast fed-state use CHO-mouth rinse . It remain determined whether CHO-mouth rinse effective improve short duration exercise performance subject fast , compare fed-state . The investigator test hypothesis CHO-mouth rinse improve performance fasted-state compare placebo-rinse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well establish carbohydrate ( CHO ) ingestion prolong , moderate- high-intensity endurance-type exercise delay onset fatigue enhance exercise performance . Interestingly , several study report CHO ingestion also improve performance intense exercise short duration—less 45-60 min . However , apparent metabolic explanation improvement , endogenous CHO store limit exercise performance short duration exercise task . To examine exogenous endogenous glucose kinetics high-intensity cycling exercise , Carter colleague test 6 endurance athlete 1 h 75 % Wmax infusing either 20 % glucose 0.9 % saline . Despite great plasma glucose availability glucose-infusion trial , total CHO oxidation rate differ treatment . Moreover , performance benefit observe intravenous glucose administration . Consequently , author suggest CHO ingestion high-intensity exercise short duration might exert ergogenic effect act central nervous system , possibly mediate glucose receptor mouth gastrointestinal tract . To test hypothesis , Carter colleague investigate impact carbohydrate mouth-rinse solution 1-h time trial performance . The use mouth-rinse treatment , CHO solution spat without swallow , choose remove influence gut exogenous CHO oxidation performance . Participants report cycle faster mouth rinse 6.4 % maltodextrin solution every 12.5 % trial complete compare placebo rinse . The author conclude CHO mouth rinse improves time trial performance mechanism responsible might increase central drive motivation mediate glucose receptor mouth . However former study , subject test fasted state , impractical compare athlete normally prepare train competition . In follow-up former study , test performance effect carbohydrate mouth rinse 2 h subject ingest CHO rich meal . From evolutionary viewpoint , speculate potential stimulating effect glucose mouth might considerable impact condition liver glycogen store might compromise . In agreement theory , performance improvement CHO mouth rinse time trial performance 2 h follow ingestion CHO -rich meal . However , study demonstrate result ergogenic effect CHO mouth rinse short duration time trial remains determine whether CHO mouth rinse improves performance 1 h time trial fast state . Therefore , present study aim investigate potential ergogenic effect CHO mouth rinse 1 h time trial performance fast fed state .</detailed_description>
