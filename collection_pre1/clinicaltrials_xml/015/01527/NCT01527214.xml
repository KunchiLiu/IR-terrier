	<brief_summary>Background : The primary investigation lung cancer ( LC ) 85 % case conduct General Practice , sadly tend take relatively long time first time patient see General Practitioner diagnose . LC symptoms common , usual benign disease . Only 33 % LC patient present alarm symptom . On average General Practitioner Denmark see one patient newly diagnose lung cancer year doctor therefore get clinical experience refer patient , test often come negative therefore fail refer delay increase - poor prognosis result . Centrally diagnosis conventional chest X-ray , unfortunately inefficient many case , CT scan proven effective even small tumor . Hypothesis aim : The project three main hypothesis test 1 ) GP 's use cancer fast-track detection suspect lung cancer optimize relation interpretation symptom subsequent referral practice radiological investigation . 2 ) General Practitioners special training change referral routine 3 ) direct access fast CT scan lead earlier diagnosis lung cancer . Methods : The first part study register-based study lung cancer patient ' road diagnosis , base database newly diagnose cancer patient year . Second part study clinical , randomized study effect referral directly fast chest CT scan . Primary endpoint delay , secondary endpoint referral pattern ( use fast-track packet ) , primary use CT 1-year mortality . Furthermore side effect , include patient group increase delay . The study contribute new knowledge way GP 's interpret symptom , way refer patient suspect cancer , use diagnostic imaging cancer fast-track pathway . It provide unique opportunity create necessary knowledge effect direct referral fast CT scan might decision aid whether open direct CT scan General Practice group patient .</brief_summary>
