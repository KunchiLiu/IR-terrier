	<brief_title>68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT Healthy Volunteers Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Integrin αⅤβ3 important member receptor family express preferentially various type tumor cell activate endothelial cell tumor angiogenesis , low quiescent vessel cell normal cell . Therefore , integrin αⅤβ3 receptor become valuable target diagnosis response evaluation malignant tumor . The tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) specifically bind integrin αⅤβ3 receptor . Accordingly , variety radiolabeled RGD-based peptide develop non-invasive imaging integrin αⅤβ3 expression via positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . Among RGD radiotracers study , two PET image agent , 18F-Galacto-RGD 18F-AH111585 , investigated clinical trial , result demonstrate radiotracers allow specific image various type tumor , tumor uptake correlate well expression integrin αⅤβ3 . Recently , series RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αⅤβ3-binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence , importantly , exhibit significantly increase tumor uptake improve vivo kinetics animal model . As representative , 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model . No adverse reaction observe animal model date . For interest clinical translation 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 , open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study design investigate radiation dosimetry , plasma pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , safety diagnostic performance 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 healthy volunteer lung cancer patient . A single dose nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg BNOTA-PRGD2 ) intravenously inject healthy volunteer lung cancer patient . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image . Changes blood pressure , pulse , respiration , temperature , routine blood urine test , serum alanine aminotransferase , albumin , creatinine , adverse event collect volunteer . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>
