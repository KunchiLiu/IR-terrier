	<brief_title>Tenecteplase ( TNK ) Loculated Pleural Effusions Patients With Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design trial single-center , prospective , blind , randomize trial compare infusion TNKase versus saline treatment symptomatic loculated pleural effusion patient malignancy . Patients known malignancy symptomatic loculated pleural effusion refer percutaneous drainage eligible study . Patients undergo standard placement 8-10 french percutaneous drain pleural space compute tomography ultrasound guidance . If incomplete drainage pleural fluid time initial catheter placement followup chest radiography perform within 24-48 hour chest tube placement reveals persistent pleural fluid , effusion consider loculated . After informed consent , patient alternately randomize 3 day course twice day intrapleural TNKase sterile saline injection . Both patient patient 's primary care physician blind infusate . The test fluid keep pleural space minimum 2 hr drainage tube return suction . The standard dose TNKase 4 mg/60 ml NS . The control group receive 60 ml NS infusion . There cross-over design patient fail significant drainage first 2 day therapy may switch infusate additional three day ( primary care provider 's discretion ) . Thus , patient saline arm switch TNKase symptomatic persistent residual loculated effusion fail TNKase switch saline 2 day . This necessary order primary care provider allow patient enrol study since standard care use Activase . We use cutoff 2 day rather 3 day switch therapy justify expense keep patient hospitalize extra day face fail therapy give extremely high cost hospitalization . Therefore , patient significant drainage first 2 day therapy either agent ( saline TNKase ) , primary care provider may request patient cross agent . However , , albeit incomplete , drainage first 2 day therapy , ask primary care provider wait complete course intrapleural injection perform . We expect enroll 40 patient period 18 month .</detailed_description>
