	<detailed_description>The patient pathological diagnosis active lupus nephritis currently follow referred outpatient department ( OPD ) 7 participate medical center Thailand . Patients come attend select accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Outcome measurement - The patient follow-up 1 year evaluate clinical manifestation laboratory investigation lupus nephritis adverse effect therapy visit . - Blood pressure laboratory assessment , include complete blood cell count , urinalysis , urine protein creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) , kidney liver function , perform visit 24 week end study ( 48 week ) . - Serum anti-double-stranded DNA antibody serum C3 measure every 8 week treatment 24 week end study ( 48 week ) . - A fasting lipid profile also measure every 8 week 24 week end study ( 48 week ) . - Renal extrarenal disease activity SLE measure use SLEDAI2K . The SLEDAI2K evaluate time entry study every 8 week treatment 24 week end study ( 48 week ) . - SLICC damage index , SF-36 , EQ5D , SLEQOL evaluate time entry , 24 week , end study . - Patients ' serum urine ( blood 3ml urine 50 ml ) collect baseline , 2nd week , 4th week , 12th week , 48th week analysis biomarkers future .</detailed_description>
