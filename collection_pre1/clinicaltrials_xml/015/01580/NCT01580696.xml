	<brief_summary>Folate binding protein ( FBP ) highly over-expressed breast , ovarian endometrial cancer source immunogenic peptide ( E39 ) stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) recognize destroy FBP-expressing cancer cell laboratory . The purpose study test whether peptide-based vaccine consist E39 peptide mix FDA-approved immunoadjuvant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) safe effective induce vivo peptide-specific immune response . Furthermore , investigator intend determine best dose vaccine utilize produce immunity efficiently . The investigator determine whether immunity FBP prevent clinical recurrence . Additionally , investigator compare result result trial utilizing E75 peptide ( HER2/neu protein ) ovarian endometrial cancer patient preparation study combination vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/IIa Trial Folate Binding Protein Vaccine Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator intend assess safety document local systemic toxicity folate binding protein ( FBP ) peptide vaccine E39 + GM-CSF give adjuvant setting . Investigators also intend determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) peptide vaccine , well evaluate vivo cellular immune response vaccine . Time recurrence vaccinate patient vs. match control track . The primary endpoint safety optimal dose vaccine induce vivo peptide-specific immune response . The clinical endpoint time recurrence date enrollment . The study multicenter , phase I/IIa trial FBP peptide E39 + GM-CSF . The target study population female civilian military health care beneficiary age 18 year diagnosis ovarian , endometrial , fallopian , peritoneal cancer undergone primary surgical medical therapy , post-menopausal surgically induced menopause , currently without evidence disease . Disease-free subject standard care multi-modality therapy screen HLA type since E39 vaccine specific HLA-A2+ patient ( approximately 40 % US population ) . HLA-A2-patients follow prospective clinically match control recurrence . HLA-A2+ patient meet eligibility criterion test biomarkers indicate progression/recurrence ovarian advanced uterine cancer FBP . FBP+ HLA-A2+ patient vaccinate FBP peptide ( E39 ) GM-CSF . HLA-A2-negative patient individual eligible receive vaccine decline follow clinically match control disease recurrence/progression . Treatment begin within one month subject enrollment study confirmation eligibility . The 1 ml volume vaccine administer intradermally 0.5 mL inoculums two different site within 5 cm . A total six vaccination give every 3-4 week administer lymph node drain area . The dose escalation scheme three patient receive dos : 100 , 500 , 1,000 mcg peptide . Patients enrol consecutively . An additional three patient may receive give dose depend presence dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Prior fourth vaccination , patient assess liver , renal , hematopoietic function . If organ function stable DLT see , patient continue series . After last patient give dose group complete third inoculation organ function proven stable , next dose group initiate . Optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) define minimum dose vaccine give optimal last vivo immunologic response vaccinate peptide . Up 15 patient vaccinated OBD . Additionally , E39-vaccinated patient randomize receive either E39 J65 ( attenuate version E39 ) booster promote long-term E39-specific immunity . The clinical endpoint long-term FBP immunity , time recurrence date enrollment 5-year survival rate . Those individual eligible receive vaccine , decline HLA-A2- patient follow clinically match control disease recurrence/progression Subjects follow safety issue , immunologic response clinical recurrence . Subjects monitor 48-72 hour inoculation reaction inoculation well documentation adverse effect experience . Immunologic response document ex vivo phenotypic functional assay well vivo delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction . All patient follow total 5 year document disease-free status . The investigator intend enroll 60 patient enrol study-wide ( 15-24 vaccine arm , 36 control arm ) . With accrual begin April 2012 enrollment last patient anticipate occur December 2014 follow five-year follow-up period . The duration trial expect seven year .</detailed_description>
