	<detailed_description>Dental plaque bacterial biofilm adhere tooth surface different area tooth : supragingival , plaque gingival margin subgingival plaque . It mainly compose complex bacterial population organize carbohydrate matrix also contain small number epithelial cell , leukocyte , macrophage inorganic component calcium phosphorus . This biofilm develop virtually place damp surface teeth stable support bacterial colonization . Mechanical oral hygiene procedure tooth brushing , dental floss inter-dental brushing effective method plaque removal mouth rinse contain anti-microbials play important role maintain oral health . Chlorhexidine ( CHX ) digluconate , cationic biguanide , know effective anti-plaque anti-inflammatory agent gold standard chemical plaque control . The benefit CHX base high intra-oral substantivity bactericidal bacteriostatic activity . This ingredient , deliver orally , free systemic toxicity microbial resistance , supra-infections occur . It proven several `` vitro '' `` vivo '' study , safety long-term efficacy CHX mouth rinse . There suggest many indication use antiseptic plaque control one important factor proper heal periodontal surgery implant therapy . The 0.2 % CHX solution become standard international concentration , due development Europe similar level plaque inhibition achieve large volume low concentration solution CHX . A low concentration CHX ( 0.12 % ) test several study also show confer clinical benefit . More important concentration CHX seem dose balance efficacy local side effect user acceptability . The optimum dose consider 20 mg twice daily . Clinically , 0,12 % CHX find similarly effective 0.2 % volume rinse increase 10 15 ml , yield 18 mg dose occasion respect plaque growth inhibition , small significant difference favour 0.2 % CHX concentration . CHX mouthrinses variety side effect common , accord manufacturer product , loss taste , tongue burn irritation oral mucosa . Some brand lower concentration CHX mouthrinses remove ethanol order eliminate side effect soreness improve acceptability . A study conclude perturbation taste perception use 0.12 % CHX significantly low use 0.2 % CHX . On hand , another study conclude significant difference term taste perception . This study double-blinded , randomized two group parallel , compare antiplaque efficacy two mouth rinse , 3-day plaque accumulation model , periodontal healthy patient . After supragingival prophylaxis participant rinse twice day 72h non-brushing period . Primary outcome variable plaque index . As secondary outcome taste side effect variable study .
