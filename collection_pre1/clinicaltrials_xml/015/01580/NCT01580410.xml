	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give oxaliplatin mitomycin C directly abdomen surgery work treat patient tumor appendix . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin mitomycin C , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Heating chemotherapy solution infuse directly abdomen may kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare toxicity profile within 4 week surgery oxaliplatin mitomycin C deliver via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy patient peritoneal surface malignancy primary appendiceal tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time progression patient treat oxaliplatin vs. mitomycin C deliver via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy surface malignancy primary appendiceal tumor . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction receive mitomycin C hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) . Arm II : Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction receive oxaliplatin HIPEC . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month .</detailed_description>
