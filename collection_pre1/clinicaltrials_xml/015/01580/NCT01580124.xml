	<brief_title>CatHeter Ablation perSistEnd Atrial Fibrillation : Pulmonary Vein Isolation Versus Defragmentation . The CHASE-AF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study protocol : In patient randomized PVI alone , index procedure consist wide circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( 1 cm distal PV ostium ) include optional right atrial isthmus ablation . Endpoint PVI entrance block evaluate circumferential mapping catheter sinus rhythm end procedure . In patient NavX® three-dimensional mapping system use . The St. Jude Medical Coolflex® Coolpath® catheter may use operator 's discretion . In patient randomized strategy aim atrial fibrillation termination PVI also initial step procedure follow atrial defragmentation eventual linear ablation case atrial tachycardia aim acute restoration sinus rhythm . The procedural step regard map ablation atrial fibrillation consecutive atrial tachycardia follow previously describe method ( 8,9 ) . After initial ablation previous antiarrhythmic drug treatment continue de novo antiarrhythmic drug regiment apply . The primary endpoint study recurrence atrial arrhythmia 6 12 month initial ablation procedure . In study arm , CE certify catheter use . Usually , set consists decapolar catheter position coronary sinus , one circumferential mapping catheter map pulmonary vein , one quadripolar catheter map right atrium . In study group externally irrigate catheter map ablation use ( CoolFlex/ Coolpath mention ) . Sample size calculation : According assumption difference 30 % regard primary endpoint ( power 80 , alpha=0.05 ) 70 patient include . Considering potential drop 10 % 160 patient include . However , adaptive statistical plan apply ( Prof. Wegscheider , University Hospital Hamburg ) . Follow repeat procedure : Crossover two treatment option avoid . Previous antiarrhythmic drug treatment continue month 6 index procedure complete . Repeat procedures month 0 3 avoid . Repeat procedure plan month 3 6 index procedure . The initial approach repeat procedure index procedure ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , patient randomize PVI alone , PVI repeat case reconnection vein . In set complete block pulmonary vein also patient randomize PVI alone receive substrate modification group . Patients randomized ablation procedure aim AF termination receive 'complete ' procedure include assessment PVI ablation atrial tachycardias atrial fibrillation . Follow-up : All patient see outpatient clinic every 3 month 12 month study period . The visit include ECG Holter ECG recording . Additionally , echocardiography interrogation pacemaker perform .</detailed_description>
