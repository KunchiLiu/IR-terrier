	<brief_summary>Differentiating malignant benign bile duct stricture conundrum , since diagnostic test highly sensitive diagnose cancer . While ERCP effective palliate obstructive jaundice , standard diagnostic tool ERCP low diagnostic sensitivity confirm stricture 's etiology &lt; 50 % case . During first ERCP , standard practice obtain routine cytology ( RC ) use single brush sample . If diagnostic , patient often undergo repeat ERCP , endoscopic ultrasound , increase health care cost . The incremental yield perform alternate ERCP-based diagnostic tool first ERCP include fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , cholangioscopy w/biopsy multiple brush routine cytology currently unknown . There study quantify amount test utilized firmly diagnose etiology stricture , efficient combination diagnostic tool first ERCP . These important knowledge deficiency since definitive tissue diagnosis first ERCP could reduce need downstream test expedite treatment , thereby improve patient-centered economic outcome . The added cost use multiple tool first ERCP may offset benefit . Among patient indeterminate bile duct stricture , investigator hypothesize multimodality approach sensitive without significant reduction specificity compare multiple brush sample routine cytology . The investigator test hypothesis use experimental trial design randomize patient first ERCP multiple brushing sample cytology vs. single brush sample cytology + FISH + cholangioscopy w/biopsy . To obtain preliminary data definitive multi-center trial , investigator propose pilot feasibility study compare performance characteristic approach evaluate prospective clinical course , include treatment delay , quality life , life expectancy enrol patient . If hypothesis validate subsequent definitive study , standard approach tissue sample first ERCP may alter .</brief_summary>
