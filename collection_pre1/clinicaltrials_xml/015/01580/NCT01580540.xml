	<brief_title>Head Head Study Epi proColon FIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong evidence support use FOBT CRC screening , early randomize controlled trial demonstrate reduction CRC incidence mortality CRC screening . Despite implementation incremental improvement gFOBT- FIT-based test , continue represent small percentage CRC screen currently remain largely province large , integrate healthcare delivery system . Reasons limited adoption stool-based testing complicate , include lack physician recommendation , patient preference , cultural barrier . Availability blood-based test may overcome adoption challenge presently face stool-based CRC screening facilitate well compliance CRC screening guideline . However , currently FDA-approved vitro diagnostic test detection CRC blood sample . As , high through-put blood-based test performance characteristic similar fecal testing could satisfy clinical need . This study design prospectively collect match blood stool specimens clinical data screen guideline-eligible subject find invasive colorectal cancer ( CRC ) colonoscopy , i.e . AJCC/UICC stag I , II , III , IV , collection specimen test colonoscopy screen guideline-eligible subject blood stool specimen collect colonoscopy . A complete subject FIT result , Epi proColon result , medical diagnosis/colonoscopy determine clinical status ( CRC , non-CRC ) . Demographic baseline covariates report individual .</detailed_description>
