	<brief_summary>Urticaria frequent skin condition characterise transient wheal flare type skin reaction associate severe pruritus . Cold contact urticaria ( CCU ) frequent form physical urticaria characterize development wheal flare type skin reaction due release histamine proinflammatory mast cell mediator follow exposure skin cold . Among physical urticaria subtypes frequency CCU vary 5.7 % 33.8 % different study . Physical urticarias include CCU know severely impair quality life affect patient . The treatment choice CCU , well inducible form spontaneous urticaria , non-sedating H1 antihistamine . Recent data show updosing H1 blocker significantly effective reduce symptom cold urticaria standard-dose treatment . Thus , patient sufficiently control standard-dose antihistamine receive high-dose H1 blocker 4 time standard dose recommend new international guideline management urticaria . Previous phase II study patient chronic spontaneous urticaria show favorable result treatment omalizumab ( XolairÂ® ) . Proof-of-concept data complete study suggest omalizumab improves urticaria patient chronic spontaneous urticaria fail treatment H1 antihistamines well failed treatment combination H1 H2 antihistamine leukotriene receptor antagonist . In addition , two case report patient severe therapy refractory CCU treat omalizumab report complete response urticarial symptom cold challenge . In summary , data suggest omalizumab may beneficial effect treatment CCU .</brief_summary>
