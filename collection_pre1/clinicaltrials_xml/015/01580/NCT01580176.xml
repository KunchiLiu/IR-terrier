	<brief_summary>This study first study new central venous microdialysis-based continuous glucose monitoring system ( Continuous GlucoseMonitor ) use investigate performance Continuous GlucoseMonitor , measurement compare point care reference ( RAPIDLabÂ® 1265 blood gas analyser ) . Further important point also much less blood sampling / blood loss patient personnel cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous GlucoseMonitor Measurement Blood Glucose Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard measure blood glucose concentration ICU manually draw blood sample arterial catheter analyse sample use point care blood gas analyser . This technique several disadvantage cause considerable blood loss produce continuous blood glucose profile labour intensive ( multiple sample time need follow change blood glucose concentration ) . The monitoring system ( Continuous GlucoseMonitor ) base microdialysis technique advantage blood , physiological fluid saline use test medium . In brief , physiological fluid , call perfusate continuously perfuse microdialysis probe . At membrane probe , glucose ( low-molecular weight molecule ) diffuse surround sample perfusate , call dialysate , transport outside probe ex vivo monitoring .</detailed_description>
