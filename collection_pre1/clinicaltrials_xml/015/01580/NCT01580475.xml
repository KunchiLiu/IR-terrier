	<brief_summary>- This study examine effect training , detrain retraining , use combined strength aerobic exercise program , physiological parameter patient type 2 diabetes . - Thirteen woman type 2 diabetes follow supervised aerobic strength train program 9 month , interrupt 3 month ( detrain ) resume period 9 month ( retrain ) . - Training improved body mass index , fast plasma glucose , postprandial glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , peak oxygen consumption , power output total muscle strength . Detraining reversed PPG , HbA1C physical fitness parameter . Resumption train however , improved initial training adaptation . - Diabetic patient follow regular uninterrupted exercise program throughout life order control glucose metabolism improve health status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During last decade , positive effect aerobic exercise patient type 2 diabetes well document . Recently , resistance exercise gain popularity diabetic patient since several study indicate type training safe induces favorable adaptation physical fitness metabolic profile . According recent scientific evidence , complete rehabilitation program patient type 2 diabetes combine strength aerobic exercise ; thus American Diabetic Association late guideline recommend strength train part exercise program least two time week . On contrary well documented effect physical training , lack data negative alteration detrain patient type 2 diabetes . The partial complete loss training-induced adaptation consequence training reduction cessation well-documented several detrain study healthy subject , old individual patient coronary artery disease . For example , investigator know even 6 day physical inactivity reduces insulin action well-trained runner attribute significant reduction muscle GLUT-4 level . Factors illness , injury , travel vacation may interrupt train process long period , affect treatment people type 2 diabetes . For population , important quantify change physiological metabolic parameter result cessation exercise , since exercise training major therapeutic method . To best knowledge , data concern loss physiological adaptation occur exercise cessation patient type 2 diabetes , previously train long period time . The current study evaluate effect three month detrain nine month combine strength aerobic training program glycemic control , body composition , peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) muscular strength patient type 2 diabetes . Further , investigator examine extent regain adaptation resumption train period nine month .</detailed_description>
