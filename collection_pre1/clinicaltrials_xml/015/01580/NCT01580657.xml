	<brief_summary>Randomized clinical trial HIV prevention intervention typically include extensive baseline assessment risk behavior intervention target . Such pretests potential direct participant ' attention factor put risk HIV infection . Evidence intervention study control group , motivational enhancement attitude change literature , preliminary study suggest assessment lead people think behavior potentially negative outcome lead motivation risk behavior reduction . As consequence , HIV intervention research use baseline assessment may accurately predict impact give HIV prevention intervention outside research context , particular intervention evaluate among high-risk , isolated individual . However , actual effect well public-health consequence mechanisms HIV assessment reactivity never systematically test . The propose assessment reactivity study conduct South Africa , country high level HIV prevalence , incidence , stigma . The Republic South Africa 's HIV/AIDS epidemic emerge recently relative sub-Saharan country , yet 21.5 % South Africans age 15-49 -- 1 5 people -- infect HIV ( UNAIDS , 2004 ) . Despite common presence HIV South Africa , remain largely hidden disease HIV-related stigma interfere people ' ability protect open discussion spontaneous reflection personal risk . Under condition , reasonable expect sizable effect direct people 's attention HIV relevant behavior , effect could incorrectly ascribe brief intervention use low-resource setting . The condition South Africa , therefore , heighten clinical public health significance assessment reactivity issue ( ) vital understand reactivity may affect result behavioral intervention trial , ( b ) may possible capitalize assessment reactivity brief , assessment-based intervention . This study allow u achieve primary aim : 1 . To separate effect brief HIV-risk reduction intervention potential effect two type baseline assessment commonly apply HIV intervention research : detailed , calendar-based assessment general frequency assessment . The detailed calendar-based assessment potentially lead participant observe specific risk-behavior situation , provide opportunity reassess risk involve situation light health goal thus motivate behavior change . The general frequency assessment merely prompt participant estimate overall frequency engage several HIV-related behavior . The effect assessments participant ' sexual behavior examine alone combination HIV-risk reduction intervention . In addition , project two important secondary aim : 1 . To generate urgently need additional efficacy data promise HIV risk reduction intervention culturally tailor use find effective South Africa 2 . To determine potential HIV preventive effect different type HIV risk behavior assessment risk behavior reduction South Africa future intervention development To achieve aim , investigator : 1 . Recruit 1500 patient ( 50 % woman ) , age 18-44 , Spencer Rd . STD Clinic , Cape Town , South Africa . 2 . Randomly assign participant within gender one 6 study arm modify Solomon Four-Group ( SFG ) design . The 2 ( intervention : standard care vs. efficacious theory base HIV prevention intervention ) x 3 ( baseline face-to-face interview : none vs. basic single-item frequency question vs. detailed partner-by-partner calendar-based interview ) factorial design depict :</brief_summary>
