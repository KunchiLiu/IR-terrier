	<brief_summary>Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) improve image contrast allow blue light center 415 nanometer heavily absorb oxyhemoglobin highlight tissue 's microvasculature enhance detail surface mucosa reveal subtle change . Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) mucosal vessel change cancer transformation angiogenesis . The ability NBI scope visualize submucosal vessel form premise prediction dysplasia BE mucosa . NBI image BE mucosa obtain endoscopy classified academic endoscopists community endoscopists initially . The endoscopists ask predict histopathology base NBI surface pattern . This clinical trial evaluate inter-observer agreement simple , consensus driven narrow band imaging ( NBI ) classification system surface pattern ability differentiate dysplastic versus non-dysplastic Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) patient undergo BE screen surveillance expert academic center community GI practice well . Their performance evaluate accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value pattern visualize NBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , double-blinded study NBI image 50 patient enrol study . Patients undergo BE screen BE surveillance enrol study . After meet eligibility criterion , obtain informed consent , patient undergo routine upper endoscopic examination use white light endoscopy . During course upper endoscopy , BE surface pattern carefully examine endoscope overview mode ( endoscope center esophageal lumen ) close proximity BE surface ( approximately 3-5 mm away mucosa ) . In position , maximum 4 high quality image obtain different surface pattern initially WLE use NBI . Image capture standardize . All image classify base upon simplify NBI classification system use two main criterion : ( 1 ) mucosal pattern ( regular/irregular/uncertain ) ( 2 ) vascular pattern ( regular/irregular/uncertain ) . All image capture use high-definition , NBI endoscope ( 190 endoscopes-GIF-HQ 190 [ dual focus ] , Olympus Inc ) store high quality TIFF format . After image obtain , target biopsy obtain area submit histopathological evaluation separate jar . From report NBI pattern image Gastroenterologist correspond histopathological detail , accuracy interobserver agreement NBI classification system determine .</detailed_description>
