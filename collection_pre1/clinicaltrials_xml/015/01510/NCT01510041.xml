	<detailed_description>Methodology Sample Is prospective longitudinal . Forty patient COPD moderate severe obstruction ( ratio [ FEV1/FVC ] &lt; 70 % ) FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict ( RABE et al. , 2008 ) , age range 50 80 year old , sex assess treat . All subject carry spirometry bronchodilator ( BD ) medical supervision . Experimental Procedure Patients COPD undergo physical assessment general specific respiratory system receive guidance test treatment propose study . All instructed maintain medication prescribe . The evaluation include follow test : medical history , St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , assess strength endurance respiratory muscle , spirometry , maximal exercise test endurance test lower limb , Six Minute Walk Test plethysmography inductance . Assessment respiratory muscle strength The assessment respiratory muscle strength consist measure maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , perform accord Black Hyatt ( 1969 ) . The measure carry use manometer scale cmH2O ( Ger-Ar ) fit adapter nozzle , contain hole two millimeter diameter eliminate pressure facial muscle . The subject carry measure stand posture use nose clip . The MIP measure maximal inspiration , precede maximal expiration start residual volume , MEP measure maximal expiration , precede maximal inspiration base total lung capacity . The inspiratory expiratory must maintain least one second . Will perform least three maximum five measure consider acceptable difference 10 % less . The high value use statistical analysis . The patient allow one-minute rest measurement . Assessment respiratory muscle endurance Incremental constant test After measurement MIP endurance inspiratory muscle use PowerBreathe® evaluate . The test start incremental 10cmH2O ( minimum load unit ) every two minute increase 10cmH2O , conduct minute increase load . The big load sustain least one minute maximum consider . The test hold constant 80 % pressure incremental test , determine time limit implementation , consider 30 minute maximum time ( FIZ et al. , 1998 ; RAMIREZ-SARMIENTO et al. , 2002 ) . In test breathe pattern free breathing frequency note . Besides pressure generate monitor manometer attach PowerBreathe® . Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) 6MWT perform track 30 meter long 1.5 wide , marking every 2 foot . Tests conduct accordance standard ATS ( 2002 ) . Every two minute check oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , heart rate ( HR ) , sensation dyspnea fatigue lower limbs Borg CR10 scale . These measure associate measurement blood pressure ( BP ) check , immediately test six minute . It two test day , interval 30 minute , avoid effect learning test performance . It consider great distance statistical analysis . Maximum Exercise Testing To perform test follow Standardization technique equipment exams exercise test spirometry ( 2003 ) , conduct room properly heat , keep temperature around 18 ° C 22 ° C relative humidity air 50 % 70 % . It perform cardiologist treadmill use modify Bruce protocol , good option patient low functional capacity , elderly people respiratory cardiovascular disease . This protocol speed incline treadmill increase every three minute modify . The two early stage low velocity inclination ( SAMORA e VERSIANI , 2008 ; NEDER e NERY , 2003 ) . In addition , monitor continuous ECG trace rest stage check value SpO2 , dyspnea fatigue lower limbs Borg CR10 scale BP . The criterion interrupt test : elevate blood pressure ( DBP ) 120 mmHg , sustain drop systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , mark elevation SBP 260mmHg , reach maximum HR ( HRmax ) provide age , fall SpO2 80 % , ECG abnormality , patient 's request due physical exhaustion , dyspnea disproportionate exercise intensity , pain low limb , dizziness chest discomfort ; failure monitor system / record . Test endurance low limbs This test conduct treadmill 30 minute intensity 80 % speed slope obtain maximal exercise testing . Inductance plethysmography For test use system respiratory inductive plethysmography ( LifeShirt ; Vivo Metrics ; Ventura , CA ) , whose sensor two electrical conductor sew sleeveless vest , stay region nipple umbilical region . There three electrode place predetermined area connect portable , battery , record SpO2 , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) body movement three ax ( CLARENBACH et al. , 2005 ) . This highly reliable instrument use monitor volume time component breathe pattern thoracoabdominal configuration . It base change cross-sectional area occur compartment chest abdomen . The method minimally invasive , require mouthpiece nose clip ( except calibration ) , therefore need direct contact air . The accuracy plethysmography provide tidal volume value satisfactory depend initial calibration proper maintenance body position . The equipment calibrate advance measure accord instruction device subject . In study , follow variable analyze plethysmography , tidal volume ( Vt ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) , minute ventilation ( VE ) , ratio time reach peak inspiratory flow inspiratory time ( PIFT / Ti ) , flow mean inspiratory ( Vt/Ti ) , percent rib cage contribution tidal volume ( % RC/Vt ) phase angle ( PhAng ) ( CLARENBACH et al. , 2005 ; PARREIRA et al , 2005 ) . These measure carry 90 degree sit standing , rest exercise arm , walking , see whether dyssynchrony occurs . The signal acquisition total duration 30 minute . Perception dyspnea assess different scale questionnaire . It perform set ADL task ( make bed , take shower , put clothes , brush teeth comb hair , lift container shelf eye level lift lower container shelf scapular waist ) patient evaluate Borg scale dyspnea portable system use assess ventilator parameter , oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide production heart rate standardize : wake making bed , take shower wash one 's back , put clothes , brush teeth comb hair , lift lower container shelf eye level , lift lower container shelf scapular waist hang . No specific amount time stipulate ; patient instruct complete task . During set ADL metabolic system ( MedGraphics VO2000 St. Paul MN , USA ) use . In addition , patient self-report MRC , LCADL scale PFSDQ-M , start protocol investigate difference correlation instrument . Training Program After test pre-experimental test , subject randomly divide two group . The treatment program consist session duration 1 hour 1 hour 30 minute depend training , three time per week alternate day 16 consecutive week , total 48 session . Before begin end session verify measure blood pressure ( BP ) , SpO2 , HR . Measures HR , SpO2 BP obtain session monitoring . All patient undergo general physical training . In training conduct stretch upper low limb , treadmill exercise HR 70-80 % HR max obtain maximum exercise test , could carry continuously interval , maximum 30 minute , resistance exercise LL , use free weight , progressive increase ½ kg month reach 2 kg last month . A group associate inspiratory muscle training ( GTMI ) . The inspiratory muscle strength train do POWERbreathe ® , patient breathe two minute , seven time one minute rest , 15 % MIP , first week , , increase 5-10 % reach 60 % initial MIP four week . After first month , every fifteen day charge adjust 60 % new value MIP . The breathing pattern remain free , patient instruct release air , hyperventilate ( HILL et al , 2007 ) . In group patient associate specific exercise program mobility biomechanics rib cage , call respiratory exercise group ( GCR ) , exercise trunk upper limb , stretch large muscle group trunk . Upon completion protocol assess .</detailed_description>
