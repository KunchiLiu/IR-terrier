	<brief_summary>People present repeatedly Sexually Transmitted Infection ( STI ) clinic represent key population HIV prevention intervention research . Despite heighten risk absence empirical research strategy intervene repeat STI . Some STI-clinic base behavioral HIV prevention study , focus general STI patient population , find risk reduction intervention reduce incidence subsequent STI . Studies show expedite treatment STI patient ' partner reduce subsequent STI enhance partner notification reduce risk repeat infection . Those go experience repeat infection , provide risk reduction service , focus project . Repeat STI literature note , intervention study conduct low STI/HIV risk specifically among people present repeat STI . The propose study develop risk reduction intervention design STI repeater evaluate efficacy intervention cost-effectiveness . The investigator expect intervention STI repeater significantly effective standard care regard reduce participant ' STI/HIV risk . However , even highly-effective intervention unlikely adopt outcomes come high cost . Administrators need know effective `` new '' intervention , also cost-effective program replaces . Cost-effectiveness information also critical justify `` new '' intervention prevention funders ( Milwaukee Department Health ) , concerned cost effect , also tradeoff . The propose study provide comprehensive level information intervention effect cost-effectiveness required administrator resource allocation decision maker determine whether fund implement intervention . Hypothesis 1 . The investigator expect great reduction unprotected vaginal anal intercourse prevention case management compare standard care condition . Hypothesis 2 . The hypothesis case management group lower STI re-infection rate compare standard care group test use participant 's repeat STI status 12 month FU period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeat Sexually Transmitted Infection ( STI ) Patients : Tailored Socio-Contextual Intervention Reduce HIV Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study five-year project develop test intervention reduce risk among people high vulnerability HIV infection : patient present repeatedly sexually transmitted infection clinic . Repeat bacterial sexually transmit infection ( STI ) chlamydia , gonorrhea , trichomoniasis , syphilis , repeat visit STI clinic exposure potential infection , indicate persistent high-risk sexual behavior . Recidivist patient represent significant proportion public STI clinic visit . Repeat STI increase likelihood HIV transmission exposure recidivist patient may serve `` core transmitter , '' propagate ongoing epidemic endemic chain within community . Repeat STI patient also face serious health risk STI complication . In sum , STI repeaters present significant public health risk place large financial resource burden treatment system . Patients repeat STI , definition , adequately serve prevention service currently provide STI clinic . Thus , additional clinic-based service reduce patient ' risk future infection STI HIV warrant . Adequately address need repeat STI patient allow limited resource heavily invest service first-time STI patient likely recidivist patient amenable standard clinic-based risk-reduction intervention . The HIV prevention field largely silent assist patient present repeatedly STI STI risk ; publish study test intervention specifically repeat STI patient . In addition , risk-reduction intervention research base STI clinic focus directly present problem sexual risk behavior address single co-existing factor ( substance use , depression ) . However , research suggest repeat STI relate wide-ranging complex configuration contextual factor varies patient . Indeed , repeat STI high among community high rate STI general , characterized myriad contextual challenge ( unemployment , poverty ) . Novel intervention approach need help repeat STI patient reduce risk HIV infection infect others . Investigators propose address gap HIV STI prevention literature focus high-risk group recidivist patient : economically disadvantage urban African Americans . The intervention help patient address broad , `` risk-regulating '' social contextual factor identify patient ( employment , housing , domestic violence , substance abuse ) . Investigators also address individual risk behavior affective self-regulatory factor ( fatalism , problem solve skill ) , contribute continue risk behavior interfere maintenance risk reduction STI .</detailed_description>
