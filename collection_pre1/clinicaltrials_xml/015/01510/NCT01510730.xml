	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori Eradication After Endoscopic Resection Gastric Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association Helicobacter pylorus infection development gastric cancer establish epidemiologic study . Conversely , eradication H. pylorus show significant reduction incidence gastric cancer large-scale , double-blind , randomize control trial . Eradication H. pylorus prevent cancer effective subgroup without precancerous lesion ( , e , dysplasia , intestinal metaplasia , atrophy ) . In contrast , randomize prospective study Japan show H. pylorus eradication endoscopic resection early gastric cancer significantly reduce metachronous gastric cancer . To solve conflict issue critical gastric cancer second lead cancer incidence worldwide , particularly Korea , Japan , China high cancer incidence , incidence might decrease H. pylori eradication treatment . With respect therapeutic modality , endoscopic resection early gastric cancer currently establish treatment choice Korea Japan proven minimally invasive effective curative treatment early gastric cancer . Endoscopic resection also perform gastric dysplasia dysplasia extent malignant potential although firm evidence lack . In comparison surgical resection , endoscopic resection conserve remnant stomach . Accordingly , patient treat endoscopic resection high possibility metachronous gastric cancer treat surgical resection . So far , yet clearly establish whether H pylorus eradication gastric tumor ( early gastric cancer gastric dysplasia ) could reduce metachronous cancer . We perform randomize control , open-label trial effect new cancer development H pylorus eradication gastric tumor .</detailed_description>
