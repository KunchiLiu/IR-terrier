	<brief_summary>This open label phase I dose escalation study HCQ RAD001 patient advance renal cell carcinoma follow Phase II trial RAD001 HCQ . The target population patient one three prior treatment advance renal cell carcinoma . In phase I portion traditional 3+3 design use determine maximal tolerate dose and/or recommend phase II dose HCQ combination RAD001 po 10 mg/day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol describe multicenter phase I/II trial RAD001 combination HCQ ( phase I anticipate n=6-12 ) 35 patient phase II trial patient previously treat ( 1-3 prior regimen ) advance renal cell carcinoma . The preclinical rationale combination extensive , safety HCQ combination strategy establish , effective autophagy PD , PK assay available guide development . The practical advantage combination HCQ drug patent , commercially available , IND exempt . The institution involve combined 11 clinical protocol open accrual involve HCQ , regulatory approval rapid . There compete HCQ protocol advance renal cell carcinoma . As described sample size justification set high threshold consider RAD001 + HCQ active since many competitor potential rational combination . The 35 patient sample size design 2 stage phase II trial guide go/no-go decision regard conduct followup randomize study definitively prove efficacy . The primary ( 6 month PFS ) secondary outcome ( response rate , toxicity rate , correlative endpoint ) analyze entire group , patient population stratify number prior therapy . The phase I portion trial anticipate short , base experience HCQ trial . As safety measure include intermediate dose level use Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) . Since see response low dos HCQ trial , frequently month HCQ dose lower Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) dose many trial nausea anorexia , would like data renal cell patient treat low dose level . If activity demonstrate low dos , would informative dose modification decision patient treat dose expansion . The patient population trial , include phase I dose escalation portion advance renal cell carcinoma 1-3 prior treatment .</detailed_description>
