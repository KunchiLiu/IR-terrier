	<brief_summary>When consider 1st line gefitinib treatment NSCLC , investigator need epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutational status tumor . But patient give u information time diagnosis , require tumor tissue time period EGFR examination . So , investigator develop protocol 1st line gefitinib treatment NSCLC accord FDG-PET response . If patient show 20 % decrease peak standard uptake value ( SUV ) 1 week 's gefitinib treatment , continue treatment . If patient show le 20 % decrease SUV , switch chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Line Gefitinib FDG-PET Metabolic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gefitinib anti-tumor activity result EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition , reduce multiple downstream signal process activate cell proliferation cell response , include cell migration angiogenesis , reduce apoptosis . Recently , approve first line treatment advance NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation . In IPASS trial , tumor EGFR mutation produce 71.2 % clinical response first line gefitinib tumor wild type EGFR show 1.1 % response . Therefore , patient selection critical clinical use EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor first line treatment . When consider 1st line gefitinib treatment NSCLC , need EGFR mutational status tumor . But patient give u information time diagnosis , require tumor tissue time period EGFR examination . So , need strategy use PET scan early prediction response gefitinib . Glucose metabolic activity closely reflect response gefitinib therapy . In preclinical study gefitinib sensitive cell line , dramatic decrease FDG uptake early 2 hour treatment . And metabolic alteration precede change cell cycle distribution , thymidine uptake apoptosis . In contrast , gefitinib resistant cell exhibit measurable change FDG uptake , either cell culture vivo . The strategy use FDG-PET may guide u perform 1st line geftinib . Recently investigator report FLT-PET FDG-PET could predict response EGFR tyrosine kinase ( TKI ) early 1 week treatment . And % decrease 20 % maximum SUV main lesion 1 week EGFR TKI treatment could predict response drug . More 20 % decrease SUV significant change reproducibility test also consider criterion response prediction paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy . So , investigator develop protocol 1st line gefitinib treatment NSCLC accord FDG-PET response . And patient show less 20 % decrease peak SUV , investigator stop gefitinib treat regimen pemetrexed/cisplatin .</detailed_description>
