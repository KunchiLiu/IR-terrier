	<brief_summary>This project assess usability feasibility multi-behavioral computerized , tailor intervention ( CTI ) expert system deliver via Internet veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom . Three behavioral health risk factor , ( 1 ) smoking , ( 2 ) depression , ( 3 ) stress , associate Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , include Computerized , Tailored Intervention ( CTI ) system . The project adapt modifies exist CTI system build Transtheoretical Model Behavior Change ( TTM ) make relevant veteran population . The system successfully utilized general adult population . The study utilizes method characteristic product development project . Each four project phase sequential build upon result previous phase . Phase 1 focus review current CTI program smoke cessation , stress management , depression prevention , integrate multi-behavioral program application veteran . Phase 2 include development adaptation text-based feedback message multimedia component smoke cessation , stress management , depression prevention veteran . Initial test modify CTI program commences Phase 3 . Cognitive usability test veteran perform , additional modification behavioral module make base test result . Phase 4 focus feasibility study test multi-behavioral CTI system veteran online .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof concept project develop pilot test viable Internet-based intervention assist veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom progress toward change negative health behavior associate PTSD often difficult change . Most commercially available CTIs software application limited impact , lack theory-driven material empiricism . The propose CTI support 30 year scientific evidence , use Transtheoretical Model Behavior Change ( TTM ) theoretical basis generate personalize intervention ( Prochaska &amp; Velicer , 1997 ; Velicer , Prochaska , &amp; Redding , 2006 ) . The TTM ideally suit resistant change unlikely take action near future , well prone relapse . The intervention primarily target negative coping strategy confound exacerbate Post-Traumatic Stress symptom hinder progress toward remission . Progress Transtheoretical Model Behavior Change ( TTM ) conceptual framework may define movement one TTM stage change next level change process , rather elimination significant reduction smoking , depression , stress per se . The CTI system modify project empirically test validated general population demonstrate significant outcome three propose module â€” smoke cessation , depression prevention , stress management . The CTI system provide intervention emphasizes advancement process change one 's pace focus project , rather linear progression structure behavior change program achieve change undesired behavior . Hypothesis 1 : The structure TTM-based content adapt Smoking Cessation , Depression Prevention , Stress Management system consequent CTI appropriate veteran . Primary Aim 1 : To modify TTM-based Smoking Cessation , Depression Prevention , Stress Management behavioral intervention module , originally develop general adult population , appropriate relevant veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom . Secondary Aim 1a : To conceptualize CTI program 's approach , content , design base input diverse sample military veteran expert consultant . Hypothesis 2 : A multi-behavioral CTI successfully implement veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom Primary Aim 2 : To demonstrate multi-behavioral CTI successfully implement veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom . Secondary Aim 2a : To conduct usability interview veteran ensure target population navigate computerize intervention understand intervention content . Secondary Aim 2b : To demonstrate feasibility CTI : ) recruiting veteran project delivery propose intervention ; b ) assess acceptability perceive usefulness intervention perspective veteran Post-Traumatic Stress symptom . Secondary Aim 2c : To demonstrate feasibility CTI increase motivation change target behavior , i.e. , smoke cessation , depression prevention , stress management . Secondary Aim 2d : To demonstrate positive change assessment outcomes Post-Traumatic Stress symptom , depression , quality life , perceive stress .</detailed_description>
