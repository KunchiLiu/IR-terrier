	<brief_title>Combining Lesinurad With Allopurinol Inadequate Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allopurinol standard care treatment gout . Nevertheless , patient treat allopurinol achieve recommend serum urate ( sUA ) target &lt; 6.0 mg/dL need additional therapy achieve target . Probenecid benzbromarone uric acid transporter 1 ( URAT1 ) inhibitor , generally recommend second-line agent patient either resistant intolerant allopurinol . However , benzbromarone available US probenecid rarely use . Consequently , clear unmet medical need new safe effective therapy gout , lesinurad , potent URAT1 inhibitor , use combination allopurinol patient respond adequately allopurinol monotherapy high rate response achieve nearly gout patient , rather minority.The subject select study moderate severe gout inadequate response allopurinol</detailed_description>
