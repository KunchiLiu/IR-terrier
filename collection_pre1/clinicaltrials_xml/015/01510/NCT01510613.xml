	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Dexamethasone ( PDex ) AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II open-label single-arm dose-escalation study . Patients systemic AL amyloidosis achieve complete response initial treatment alkylating agent ( Melphalan Cyclophosphamide ) Bortezomib enrol . Patients receive 1 previous treatment , could treat alkylators and/or Bortezomib due contraindication , eligible . Twenty-eight patient enrol study . The patient treat combination Pomalidomide Dexamethasone give orally 28 day cycle continuously , i.e . hematologic organ progression unacceptable toxicity . There 2 dose level Pomalidomide ( 2 4 mg/day ) . A standard 3+3 dose escalation design use . If less 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity dose level 1 , patient treat dose level 2 . There 2 dose level also Dexamethasone ( 20 40 mg/week ) . The dose dexamethasone adjust individual basis , consider fluid retention repetitive ventricular arrhythmia baseline , well Dexamethasone-related adverse event . The study comprise 3 period : screening , treatment ( evaluation response end every single cycle ) follow end-of-treatment evaluation follow-up . After give write informed consent , subject evaluate eligibility enrollment study baseline evaluation perform . Treatment continue progression unacceptable toxicity observe . After treatment discontinuation , patient follow survival possible Second Primary Malignancies signal 2 year .</detailed_description>
