The intervention base Behavioral Ecological Model ( BEM ) , interact physiological , environmental , cultural contingency select behavior . This study require five year recruit 40 orthodontist office , 1700 youth , implement office-wide intervention promote healthy diet physical activity among 8-14 yr old youth . Our primary aim detect differential change diet , physical activity BMI experimental group compare tobacco prevention control group ; observe differential effect intervention low vs. high SES ; similarly male vs. female ; validate primary outcome variable contrast `` gold standard '' ; determine degree family peer encouragement sedentary high caloric diet baseline increase relative effect orthodontist intervention . Offices assign random condition produce 2 ( experimental group ) 2 stratum ( low vs. high SES ) 2 stratum ( male vs. female ) 4 ( repeat measure ) experimental design . Those experimental condition expose office-wide intervention diet activity ; control condition expose office-wide intervention tobacco prevention . The intervention consist training orthodontist office staff provide appropriate social prompt , reinforcement counseling , modification office provide supportive physical social resource patient parent . Measures diet , physical activity , body composition , tobacco use , fitness family peer encouragement occur baseline , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Differential change time analyze use Random Effects Multivariate modeling . Analyses include control office cluster effect multivariate model include analysis hypothetical main effect , experimental group time interaction , moderate effect inclusion interaction term susceptibility experimental condition possible moderator . Relevance : If successful , study may inform policy would promote specialist ( physician , general dentist ) deliver brief counseling diet physical activity . Doing might yield cumulative exposure necessary effect sustain change large proportion preteen population .</detailed_description>
