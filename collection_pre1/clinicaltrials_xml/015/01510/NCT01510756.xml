	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 trial evaluate activity sorafenib relapse refractory CLL patient iwCLL-WG indication receive therapy . Sorafenib orally active multikinase inhibitor , target RAF/MEK/ERK signal pathway well several receptor tyrosine kinase . It FDA approve treatment hepatocellular carcinoma renal cell carcinoma . Preclinical study investigator laboratory demonstrate sorafenib cytotoxic CLL cell . The primary objective study determine overall response rate Sorafenib previously treat CLL patient . All patient receive sorafenib 400 mg twice daily continuously three month assess response . Responding patient may elect continue treatment additional 9 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The UCSD Moores Cancer conduct Phase 2 clinical trial evaluate activity sorafenib relapse refractory CLL patient . Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) oral multi-kinase inhibitor effect tumor proliferation tumor angiogenesis . It initially select base inhibition serine/threonine kinases Raf-1 wild-type B-Raf , pivotal component Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway . CLL cell derive survival support microenvironment , part activation pathway . Preclinical study perform lab demonstrate sorafenib cytotoxic CLL cell , include patient aggressive disease patient chemotherapy ( fludarabine ) resistant disease . The purpose study evaluate evidence anti-leukemic activity / clinical activity sorafenib assess decrease absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) /leukemia cell count , lymphadenopathy , splenomegaly , leukemia infiltration bone marrow assess impact sorafenib CLL B cell corollary study . Patients continue treatment 3 monthly cycle unless toxicity progressive disease . Patients note stable disease ( well ) absence significant toxicity allow receive another 1-9 cycle single agent sorafenib . All patient assess response follow 3 cycle treatment and/or follow therapy per iwCLL-WG 2008 guideline .</detailed_description>
