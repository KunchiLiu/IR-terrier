	<brief_title>Multicenter Study HGT-1110 Administered Intrathecally Children With Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) inherit , autosomal recessive disorder lipid metabolism characterize deficient activity lysosomal enzyme , arylsulfatase A ( ASA ) . MLD rare disease occur part world . The estimate overall incidence disease western world approximately 1 100,000 live birth varies geographic location . There approved therapy MLD . This multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study design evaluate safety 3 dose level ( 10 , 30 , 100 mg ) HGT-1110 administer via intrathecal drug delivery device ( IDDD ) every week ( EOW ) total 38 week ( 20 injection , Weeks 0 38 ) child MLD . The study also include assessment HGT-1110 drug product produce revised drug substance manufacturing process ( referred Process B ) fourth cohort ( Cohort 4 ) . Approximately 24 patient enrolled receive treatment HGT-1110 . Patients sequentially enrol 4 dose cohort , approximately 6 patient . Patient enrollment stagger study facilitate adequate safety monitoring per dose cohort .</detailed_description>
