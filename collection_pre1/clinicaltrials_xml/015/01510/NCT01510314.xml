	<brief_summary>The clinical symptom septic complication ( SC ) ( responsible majority morbidity colorectal surgery ) become apparent 5-7 day operation , whereas efficacy treatment depend early diagnosis . By detect complication early could possible reduce severity , length hospitalisation , repeat colostomy number readmission . Our team show C-reactive protein ( CRP ) &gt; 125 mg/L postoperative day 4 ( D4 ) predictor SC context . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) marker sepsis currently use intensive care , use follow-up elective surgery , particularly colorectal surgery , fully evaluate . The aim study compare ability CRP PCT detect SC early postoperative day 2 ( D2 ) ( intra-abdominal systemic SC , define CDC ) elective colorectal surgery . Adult patient undergo elective colorectal surgery anastomosis include give write informed consent . Levels CRP PCT measure day surgery , D1 , D2 , D3 D4 . The clinical data ( temperature , recovery bowel movement , pain , pain palpation ) record daily . Imaging examination perform discretion surgeon ; obligation perform contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT-scan CRP D4 &gt; 125 mg/L clinical anomaly . The discriminate ability ( measure area ROC curve ) CRP D2 0.653 previous study . An improvement least 0.1 necessary show superiority PCT CRP clinical term regard cost .</brief_summary>
