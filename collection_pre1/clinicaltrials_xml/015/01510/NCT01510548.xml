The study 3 arm : 33 patient randomize adalimumab 40mg every week , 33 patient randomize adalimumab 40mg every week , 33 patient randomize placebo . Study drug treatment period six week . Methods : Clinical evaluation , global assessment Oswestry Disability Score visual analog scale ( VAS ) use evaluation clinical result disc prolapse patient confirm Magnetic Resonance Imaging . Health related quality life assess 15-D questionnaire . Safety evaluate medical examination , adverse event ( AE ) collection laboratory measurement throughout study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADALISKIAS : Adalimumab Acute Disc Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims study : TNF alpha believe major role pathogenesis sciatica . The efficacy safety adalimumab versus placebo treatment acute disc prolapse compare 12 month start study drug treatment . Primary objective study evaluate clinical functionality patient Oswestry Disability Score VAS ( leg back pain ) end study drug treatment week 6 . Secondary objective compare need operative treatment , sick leave day , pain killer consumption quality life two study group 12 month start study drug treatment . Patients study drug treatment : The study population consist 99 patient sciatica cause herniated disc prolapse . The patient randomize 3 arm : 33 patient adalimumab 40mg every week , 33 patient adalimumab 40mg every week , 33 patient placebo . Study drug treatment period six week . The study population collect patient population severe sciatica symptom send Spine Unit Department Physical Rehabilitation Medicine Kuopio University Hospital . The patient information give orally investigator first visit also patient information letter give . The informed consent sign patient investigator study related procedure . Patient receive copy write information sign informed consent form . The patient right discontinue participation time without give reason . The randomisation make group take count level disc prolapse sex . In emergency case randomisation open decision investigator . Each patient require 8 site visit . At baseline visit ( visit 0 ) patient history exclusion inclusion criterion check MRI do . At visit 1 Visual Analogue Scale , Oswestry disability index Quality Life Questionnaire ( 15-D ) clinical examination patient carry . In case MRI already available baseline visit , visit combine visit 1 . At follow visit ( 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month first injection ) Visual Analogue Scale , Oswestry disability index Quality Life Questionnaire ( 15-D ) , Patients Physicians Global Assessments clinical examination patient carry Adverse Events record . If study medication help sciatica symptom enough , disc surgery evaluate decision investigator neurosurgeon orthopaedic surgeon visit 6 week . With severe symptom sign , major neurological sign intolerable pain surgery evaluate phase study ( see rescue medication ) . The patient data collect CRF source data patient record , also sick leave day use pain medication collect site visit . Patient medication history collect visit 1 . The Adverse Events evaluate visit record patient record CRF . This study investigator base study carry spine center Department Physical Rehabilitation Medicine Kuopio University Hospital . The laboratory image study carry Departments Clinical Chemistry Radiology . If surgery need Department Neurosurgery Orthopedics ask work . The Abbott Laboratories Ltd provide study medication . Adalimumab register Finland Rheumatoid Arthritis . The study medication give site visit investigator . Injections week 3 5 administer study subject home . Efficacy Assessments : To confirm clinical diagnosis sciatica Magnetic Resonance Imaging use Siemens Avant 1.5 T clinical scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) use . Neural compromise assess accord system Pfirrmann et al . grade 0 ( compromise , normal ) Grade 1 ( contact ) , Grade 2 ( deviation ) Grade 3 ( compression ) . Subjective disability measure Oswestry Disability Index ( 0-100 % ) , 0 % represent disability 100 % extreme difficult disability . Pain experience measure self-administered visual analogue scale VAS ( range 0-100 mm ) . It prove valid index experimental , clinical chronic pain . Patients physicians Global Assessment use clinical evaluation treatment . Quality life assess Finnish 15-D questionnaire Safety Assessments : At screen patient must evaluate active latent TB infection use PPD chest x-ray ( available previous 3 month prior screen ) detail review subject medical history . Also screen T SPOT-TB test take . All patient receive study drug include safety analysis . Safety follow-up continue 70 day last study drug injection . Safety assess AE collection , physical examination , vital sign laboratory parameter throughout study period . Safety laboratory parameter ( full blood count , ALT , AST , CRP , ESR ) evaluate baseline end study drug treatment week 6 . Adverse Events report local Ethics Committee National Agency Medicine accord regulation 2/2004 Clinical Medicinal Trials Humans . Statistical review : Sample size : The planned sample size 33 arm project provide 80 % power detect mean difference 25 leg pain VAS 6 week two-sided alpha level 0.0125 , assume standard deviation 20 . For Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) 33 patient arm , would provide 80 % power detect mean difference 16 ODI score two-sided alpha level 0.0125 , assume standard deviation 13 . Alpha-level 0.0125 select correct multiple test cause two primary end-point variable two comparison variable , placebo versus two different dos active treatment . The sample size calculation base normality assumption ; however final analysis perform use non-parametric method . However use baseline value covariate analysis compensate lose power due use distribution free-method . Statistical analysis primary end-points : The aim study demonstrate efficacy adalimumab versus placebo mean Oswestry Disability Index Leg Pain VAS week 6 . To maintain overall 5 % significance level primary end-points , Bonferroni adjustment apply , i.e . four significance test apply primary hypothesis ; p-value 0.0125 consider statistically significant . As primary analysis method , non-parametric analysis covariance baseline value covariate apply ODI Leg Pain VAS week 6 separately adalimumab 40 mg every week versus placebo adalimumab 40 mg every week versus placebo . Intent-to-treat population use primary analysis . All patient data evaluate intent-to-treat principle . For secondary end-points Bonferroni adjustment apply end-point level . Rescue medication : Rescue medication arrange case lack efficacy discretion investigator . If cauda equine symptom sign large neurological defect occur surgery performed . Also medication consider failure investigator 's clinical judgment patient opportunity evaluate disc surgery .</detailed_description>
