	<brief_title>Combination Treatment Study Subjects With Tophaceous Gout With Lesinurad Febuxostat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Febuxostat XO ( Xanthine Oxidase ) Inhibitor approve Urate Lowering Therapy ( ULT ) patient gout . Although febuxostat demonstrate superior allopurinol lower serum urate ( sUA ) &lt; 6mg/dL 3 randomize , control clinical trial , proportion subject experience reduction tophus area gout flare significantly different compare allopurinol . Although study allow subject naïve ULT enroll , anticipate majority subject currently take previously experience XO Inhibitor therapy . This trial enroll population subject high uric acid body burden , must demonstrate presence tophus .</detailed_description>
