	<detailed_description>Chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) main cause long term kidney transplant failure . Its main histological determinant interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy , mechanism change completely elucidate seem multifactorial . It seem histological change develop consequence immunological non-immunological mechanism . Study Nankivell al . define two phase CAN , early , attribute immunological mechanism ; acute rejection , persistent subclinical rejection ischemic- reperfusion injury , late injury , characterize progressive arteriolar hyalinosis , glomerulosclerosis andInterstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy ( IF/TA ) , attribute part calcineurin inhibitor use part ongoing immunologic injury . In vitro study animal study show epithelial mesenchimal transition one possible mechanism early marker subsequent IF/TA . EMT define process completely differentiate epithelial cell undergo transition fibroblast phenotype cell . It known molecular level RAAS crucial role development progressive renal injury fibrosis . Role angiotensin II progression chronic kidney injury establish well know . It mediate kidney injury increase intraglomerular capillary pressure lead ultrafiltration plasma protein promote cell growth fibroproliferative effect . It hypothesize aldosterone component RAAS may also direct role proinflammatory profibrotic mechanism initiation progression kidney injury . Aldosterone mineralocorticoid hormone produce adrenal cortex zona glomerulosa crucial role regulator extracellular fluid volume sodium potassium balance . It show rat model aldosterone activates mTOR kinase , promote cell proliferation contributes early phase injury healing . However , prolonged activation mTOR seem promote development interstitial fibrosis . Although molecular pathway aldosterone-mediated renal injury yet fully elucidate , aldosterone may directly contribute final common pathway renal fibrosis . In vitro study show aldosterone significantly increase TGF beta fibronectin production mesangial cell culture event abolish aldosterone antagonist spironolactone . Randomized study show beneficial role blockade mineralocorticoid receptor heart failure . Also study show beneficial role mineralocorticoid receptor blockade nonselective antagonist spironolactone reduce albuminuria diabetic non diabetic chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) antiproteinuric effect selective aldosterone inhibitor , eplerenone type 2 diabetic patient microalbuminuria . Role mineralocorticoid receptor blockade kidney transplant recipient extensively evaluate far . In study hypothesize use mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , spironolactone , may contribute slow progression chronic histological change renal allograft .</detailed_description>
