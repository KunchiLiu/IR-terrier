	<brief_title>The Influence Growth Factors ( PDGF ) , Applied Autologous Thrombocyte Concentrate , Functional Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subacromial surgery shoulder perform often . It concern space create intervention ( open arthroscopic subacromial decompression ) rotator cuff surgery ( open arthroscopic ) . In kind surgery good wound heal tissue recovery great importance achieve optimal result . Wound heal disorder , pain formation adhesion may negatively influence postoperative course lead extend rehabilitation . This unfavourable influence personal well patient possibility return labour . Especially cuff surgery course strongly influence heal attachment cuff bone . Besides development minimal invasive technique , 's necessary look possibility decrease morbidity procedure . Recent study show growth factor play major role wound heal . This concern particularly TFG-B ( transform growth factor B ) PDGF ( platelet derive growth factor ) present thrombocyte . They act chemotactic agent polymorphonuclear leucocyte , macrophage , fibroblast lymphocyte . Both growth factor stimulate wound heal cause improve angiogenesis fibroplasia . They also play role wound retraction remodelling . In animal-experimental model prove application TGF-B PDGF improve woundhealing lead well mechanical property scar tissue . Faster good wound heal decrease development adhesion subacromial surgery possibly influence favourably use thrombocyte concentrate . In treatment autologous thrombocyte concentrate thrombocyte rich concentrate obtain centrifuge method ( Gravitational Platelet System ( GPS ) , Biomet , Warsaw USA ) ( platelet rich plasma PRP ) , apply operating field . The concentrate harvest patient blood , sampled procedure . At random concentrate applicated group compare postoperatively .</detailed_description>
