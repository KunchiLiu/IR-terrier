	<brief_summary>Ipilimumab , antibody block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 , GVAX demonstrate anti-tumor activity prostate cancer . Pre-clinical study combination demonstrate potent synergy . The purpose study investigate , use phase-I 3+3 dose escalation design follow expansion cohort , safety efficacy combine treatment GVAX ipilimumab castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial Ipilimumab GVAX Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A promising immunotherapeutic approach prostate cancer whole-cell vaccination . Irradiated allogeneic tumor cell express GM-CSF generate long-lasting specific anti-tumor immunity preclinical model . Results several phase I II trial show Prostate GVAX ( GVAX ) well tolerate suggest improved survival . Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) crucial immune checkpoint molecule down-regulates T-cell activation proliferation . Ipilimumab , fully human monoclonal antibody ( IgG1 ) block CTLA-4 , promote antitumor immunity , demonstrate two phase III trial improve overall survival metastatic melanoma patient . Pre-clinical study anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination GM-CSF secrete tumor cell vaccine demonstrate potent synergy . In phase I study investigator examine CRPC patient whether ipilimumab safely combine GVAX . In addition , investigator treat additional 16 patient dose level 3â€¢0 mg/kg determine safety profile antitumor effect GVAX ipilimumab patient CRPC .</detailed_description>
