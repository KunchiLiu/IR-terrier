	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers Samples From Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To establish telomere length measurement quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) alternative lengthen telomere ( ALT ) detection method neuroblastoma ( NB ) . - To determine frequency ALT high-risk NB characteristic ALT+ NB . - To establish C-circle ( extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA circle ) level marker ALT activity NB . - To evaluate prognostic significance ALT NB . - To evaluate utility C-circle assay detection circulate tumor DNA NB patient ALT+ tumor . OUTLINE : Archived tumor tissue serum sample analyze telomere length measurement , frequency , C-circle level PCR . Results compare patient ' age diagnosis outcomes include survival data ( event-free overall survival ) .</detailed_description>
