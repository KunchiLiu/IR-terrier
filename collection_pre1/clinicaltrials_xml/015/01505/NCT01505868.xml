	<brief_summary>This clinical research study make 2 group 2 phase . The goal Phase 1 study learn high tolerate dose combination cabazitaxel , carboplatin , prednisone give patient metastatic CRPC . The goal Phase 2 study learn add cabazitaxel combination carboplatin prednisone affect disease control patient metastatic CRPC . In phase , drug combination compare cabazitaxel alone . The safety drug combination study phase group . Cabazitaxel carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division . Prednisone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . It often give combination chemotherapy treat cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel With Without Carboplatin Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel-Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 treatment group ( depend enroll ) . - If Group 1 , receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone . - If Group 2 , receive cabazitaxel combination carboplatin plus prednisone . The first 9-18 participant assign Group 2 enrol Phase I portion study . If enrolled Phase I portion , combination dose carboplatin cabazitaxel receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low combination dose level . Each new group receive high combination dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable combination dose carboplatin cabazitaxel find . Once high tolerable combination dose find , patient enrol randomly assign ( flip coin ) study group Phase 2 . You equal chance assign group . Your study doctor tell phase group , dose level drug receive . All participant receive dose level prednisone . Study Drug Administration : You receive cabazitaxel vein 60 minute Day 1 21-day study cycle . If receive carboplatin , also receive vein , cabazitaxel dose , 60 minute Day 1 cycle . You take prednisone tablet mouth twice day ( morning evening ) , Day 1 cycle . About 30 minute receive study drug ( ) , give drug ( example , drug filgrastim ) help prevent side effect . Your doctor describe drug detail , include give side effect may expect . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your weight vital sign record . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . These test do 7 day visit . On 1 day Days 7 10 Cycle 1 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need cycle , blood draw repeat . After every 2 cycle , bone scan either CT scan MRI scan abdomen , pelvis check status disease . If study doctor think need , also chest CT scan . If study doctor think need , also blood drawn ( 3 teaspoon ) routine test . Length Treatment : You may receive study drug ( ) 10 total cycle . You take study intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction , disease get bad . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing follow-up visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : After long receive study drug ( ) , end-of-dosing visit . The following test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your weight vital sign record . - You ask side effect may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You either CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone scan check status disease . Long-term Follow-up : After end-of-dosing visit , study staff call review medical record . If contact phone , ask feeling side effect may . Each follow-up call take 5 minute . Follow-up take place every 6 month stop take study drug . This investigational study . Cabazitaxel , carboplatin , prednisone FDA approve commercially available . The use drug combination treatment prostate cancer investigational . Up 178 patient enrol study . Up 178 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
