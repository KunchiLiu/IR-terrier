	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Pregnancy childbirth involve health risk , even woman without pre-existing health problem . Postpartum hemorrhage one common complication deliver mother cause 19 % in-hospital maternal death ( Bateman BT et al . `` The Epidemiology Postpartum Hemorrhage Large , Nationwide Sample Deliveries '' Anesthesia Analgesia 2010 110:1368-1373 ) . Due pregnancy physiological change , maternal bleeding typically discover significant change vital sign , and/or symptom , usually confirm invasive laboratory hemoglobin test . This result late detection bleed affect patient outcome . Early detection sign symptom obstetric hemorrhage therefore crucial . Non-invasive continuous hemoglobin ( SpHb ) monitoring system quickly measure current hemoglobin level continuously track real-time detect fall hemoglobin level may , turn , represent early sign potential hemorrhage . Unfortunately validation clinical accuracy Rainbow device noninvasive continuous hemoglobin ( SpHb ) monitor obstetric set information concern use tool early detection postpartum hemorrhage . The investigator therefore propose undertake open , preliminary , sequential pilot study determine physiological value ( RI ) maternal continuous SpHb post-partum period . Study Objective : To determine physiological reference individual value ( RI ) maternal continuous SpHb immediately delivery post-partum period ( continuous monitoring 2 hour delivery ) order establish physiological Hb variation response physiological blood loss due delivery . Inclusion exclusion criterion Healthy parturients labor ask enrolled study inform consent obtained.Parturients consecutively include study . Bleeding risk subject exclude ( parturients : Operative instrumental vaginal delivery , Estimated blood loss great 500 mL , II III degree perineal laceration , coagulation disorder anticoagulant therapy ) Sample Size Since available information expect distribution outcome , use sequential design . The main endpoint analysis reliable estimate outcome expect healthy woman labor . The investigator state target estimate reliable ratio estimate standard error small 2 . The International Federation Clinical Chemistry ( IFCC ) Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) guideline 2008 recommend establish RIs least 120 reference individual use nonparametric rank method ( Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute . Defining , Establishing , Verifying Reference Intervals Clinical Laboratory ; Approved Guideline . 3rd ed . Wayne , PA : CLSI ; 2008 ) thus include study sample least 120 . Methods During labor parturients test standard Laboratory Hb monitor least 30 minute SpHb monitoring equipment ( Radical-7™ Pulse CO-Oximeter Rainbow DiSposable™ Adult Adhesive Sensor ) , value consider baseline value . Immediately spontaneous vaginal delivery , venous blood sample take Hb determination Radical 7 equipment SpHb connect patient 's finger record least two hour delivery . At end period observation venous blood sample take Hb determination . Additional measurement SpHb Lab Hb perform 24 hour delivery . According SpHB data collection-research protocol , sensor site connect patient 's ring finger non-dominant hand . Sensor handle placement also follow instruction SpHB data collection-research protocol . Sensor attach arm blood draw . Sensor placement hand side blood pressure cuff avoid unless draw blood extremity . Placing sensor draw blood arm use IV infusion also avoid . SpHb result include Perfusion Index ( PI , noninvasive index peripheral perfusion vasomotor tone ) value less 0.5 . Concerning blood sampling , blood drawn directly vacutainer use needle small 20G analyze within 15 min blood draw . In Vivo adjustment Trend Accuracy SpHb accuracy vivo adjustment calculate use new Radical 7 equipment vivo adjustment feature software take bias first SpHb first laboratory tHb measurement adjust subsequent measurement case . The trend accuracy calculate use follow time point : pre-delivery , 2 hr delivery 24 hr delivery . Calibrated SpHb measurement compare subsequent laboratory value create Bland Altman plot calculate bias , confidence interval .</detailed_description>
