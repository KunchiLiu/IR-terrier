	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new investigational drug ( TPI 287 ) early relapse neuroblastoma . An investigational drug one yet approve Food Drug Administration . This investigational drug call TPI 287 . This study look tumor 's response study drug , TPI 287 , combination Irinotecan Temozolomide versus combination Irinotecan Temozolomide alone . This study also evaluate safety tolerability study drug , TPI 287 .</brief_summary>
