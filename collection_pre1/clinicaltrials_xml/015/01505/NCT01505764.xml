Studies show cancer patient lose weight often respond poorly chemotherapy , great risk infection reduce life expectancy . Also , people may want eat . To date , approve treatment available condition . This study go study benefit use study drug , Anamorelin hydrochloride ( HCl ) treatment prevention cachexia associate cancer . Studies do study drug show drug help cachectic condition . The purpose research study evaluate effectiveness Anamorelin HCl compare placebo body composition ( amount cell mass , fat , muscle , etc . ) include measurement body potassium nitrogen store . In addition , study also assess effect study drug handgrip strength , body weight , lean muscle mass , quality life , appetite &amp; food intake , certain blood marker , energy expenditure ( amount energy participant burn ) , functional performance , safety tolerability Anamorelin HCl .</brief_summary>
