	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndrome relate development platelet derive thrombus rupture coronary atheroma . Use dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin-thienopyridine significantly reduce risk major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . However despite therapeutic innovation , rate MACE patient treat use PCI particularly suffer acute coronary syndrome around 5 % randomized trial . Within factor associated MACE , high treatment platelet reactivity follow clopidogrel load dose identify key factor . In fact widely recognize large inter individual variability clopidogrel responsiveness . In addition several author demonstrate strong link high treatment platelet reactivity follow clopidogrel load dose occurrence post PCI MACE . Vasodilator Phosphoprotein index measurement ( VASP index ) enable reproducible , standardize specific assessment clopidogrel responsiveness . The investigator previous work demonstrate VASP index â‰¥ 50 % high negative predictive value post PCI MACE patient undergo PCI tailor clopidogrel load dose order obtain VASP index &lt; 50 % PCI result reduction rate post PCI MACE . Prasugrel new generation thienopyridine faster powerful anti platelet effect compare clopidogrel . It show superior clopidogrel reduce post PCI MACE acute coronary syndrome . However randomized trial prasugrel achieve excessive blockade platelet reactivity responsible significant increase bleed event patient insufficient blockade 325 % remain patient . Therefore investigator hypothesize strategy individually tailor loading maintenance dose clopidogrel may superior prasugrel standard therapy achieve optimal platelet reactivity inhibition acute coronary syndrome patient undergoing PCI .</brief_summary>
