	<brief_summary>Accumulation damage protein think underlie many degenerative condition , include age , diabetes , Alzheimer 's disease , cataract , others . Over time , proteins irreversibly damage variety factor , reactive oxygen specie , without timely degradation accumulate aggregate . We believe contribute development chronic degenerative disorder . The purpose study develop novel methodology measure protein accumulation test two group people : young ( 18-30 year ) old ( ≥65 year ) . This methodology require people drink solution essential amino acid include isotopically label L [ ring-13C6 ] phenylalanine . We collect blood muscle sample , isolate plasma skeletal muscle protein . Participants return study center four time weekly interval . We hypothesize old protein , persist circulation accumulate time , high degree post-translational oxidative damage newly synthesize protein .</brief_summary>
