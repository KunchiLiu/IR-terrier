	<brief_title>Endovascular Aortic Repair Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysms dissection involve descend aorta aortic arch historically treat open surgical technique , require cardiopulmonary bypass deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) . Despite increase experience refinement procedure , remain substantial rate morality morbidity . The goal Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair ( TEVAR ) re-construct descend aorta aortic arch cover primary entry tear dissection remodel aorta . TEVAR technique perform various device available . The purpose study investigate short mid term efficacy safety Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair ( TEVAR ) patient aortic lesion , descend aortic/arch aneurysm , pseudo-aneurysm , Stanford Type B dissection , dissection primary tear locate aortic arch , et al . Primary outcome measure all-cause mortality . Secondary outcome variable include conversion stent and/or surgery , induced thrombosis false lumen , cardiovascular morbidity , aortic expansion ( &gt; 5 mm/y maximum diameter include true false lumen ) , quality life , length intensive care unit hospital stay . The study design enroll 50 patient monitor 24 month .</detailed_description>
