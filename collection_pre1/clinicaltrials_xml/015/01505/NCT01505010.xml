	<detailed_description>Objectives : To compare blood pressure lower efficacy safety renal denervation vs. usual medical therapy . The primary endpoint efficacy safety baseline-adjusted between-group difference 24-h systolic blood pressure glomerular filtration rate estimate Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKD-EPI ) equation . Secondary endpoint efficacy safety include index blood pressure control renal function , metabolic variable morbidity mortality . These endpoint assess 6 month randomization . Trial design : Randomized control trial blind assessment primary secondary endpoint . The study consist 6 stage . Supervised nonsupervised follow-up refer assessment outcome outside participate center , respectively . - Screening involves check eligibility ruling secondary hypertension . - Run-in period 3 month optimize medical treatment assess adherence treatment . - Stratification randomization Eligible patient stratify center age group ( adult vs. elderly , 20-49 vs. 50-69 year ) randomize centrally one-to-one proportion control intervention . - Renal sympathetic denervation intervention group , patient control group offer renal denervation 6 month . - Supervised follow-up 1 , 3 6 month randomization . - Long-term supervised non-supervised follow-up morbidity mortality beyond 6 month 3 year . Sample size : To detect 10-mm Hg difference ( SD 20 mm Hg ) systolic blood pressure randomize group 2-sided P-value 0.01 90 % power total 240 patient need randomize . Allowing 50 % screening failure , 480 patient would screen . Assessment adherence : Adherence treatment assess measurement drug drug metabolites biological fluid . Jung coworkers develop liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric method allow detect antihypertensive drug metabolites single urine sample . This obligatory approach implement . Assessment quality life Assessment quality life compulsory baseline visit supervise follow-up , use EuroQol 5D . Assessment sympathetic modulation : heart rate variability ( HRV ) assess baseline 6-month follow-up visit , base 15 minute ECG recording . A software program , develop LabVIEW group Aubert et al . use . Relevance : INSPiRED differs previous ongoing study several aspect : ( 1 ) stringent selection patient ; ( 2 ) drug optimization assessment adherence throughout study ; ( 3 ) out-of-the-office blood pressure patient selection follow-up ; ( 4 ) state-of-the-art renal artery image computerized tomographic angiography ; ( 5 ) validation urinary proteomic biomarkers predict blood pressure response change renal function ; ( 6 ) follow-up beyond 6 month 3 year ; ( 7 ) use heart rate variability renal nerve stimulation ass completeness renal denervation .</detailed_description>
