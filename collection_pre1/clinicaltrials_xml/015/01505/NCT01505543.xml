	<brief_summary>Proprioceptive weighting change may explain difference postural control performance . In addition , respiratory movement disturb effect postural balance . Postural balance seem impaired individual respiratory disorder . Increased risk fall report individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Besides essential role respiration , diaphragm may also play important role control trunk postural balance . The aim study clarify whether proprioceptive postural control impaired individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</brief_summary>
