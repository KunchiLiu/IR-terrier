	<brief_summary>Currently , regional anesthetic standard care total knee replacement surgery combine spinal/epidural provide long-lasting pain relief without femoral nerve block ( FNB ) . The femoral nerve block refers technique anesthesiologist use numb thigh muscle approximately 18 hour surgery . While technique offer significant pain relief , possible may cause muscle weakness increase patient ' recovery time . Hence need alterative anesthetic technique , one may help minimize postoperative pain effectively femoral nerve block , cause weakness thigh muscle . The saphenous nerve , branch femoral nerve , provide sensation knee . Thus hypothesize `` block '' anesthetize saphenous nerve local anesthetic closer branch , area around knee feel numb . Yet unlike femoral nerve block , thigh muscle still able function . For patient undergo two total knee replacement one time bilateral total knee replacement , randomly assign receive femoral nerve block one leg saphenous block . Pain level measure thigh muscle strength test use dynamometer surgery , 6-8 hour follow anesthesia administration , postoperative day 1 2 .</brief_summary>
