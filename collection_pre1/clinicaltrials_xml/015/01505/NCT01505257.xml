	<brief_title>Early Nurse Detection Management Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium acute , reversible change mental status occur 40 % person dementia . Delirium superimpose dementia ( DSD ) lead increased mortality , increased cost , nurse home placement , early re-hospitalization , functional decline . Delirium person dementia appear substantially worsen outcomes person dementia- already burden functional decline . The purpose study improve nursing detection management delirium person dementia decrease duration patient complication delirium . To achieve objective , multi-component intervention strategy call , Early Nurse Detection Delirium Superimposed Dementia ( END DSD ) test . END-DSD employ pair cluster randomize trial ( C-RCT ) three hospital total six inpatient unit 360 hospitalized person dementia achieve objective . END DSD intervention consist 1 ) Nursing education regard DSD , 2 ) Computerized decision support standardize delirium assessment management screen via electronic health record ( EHR ) , 3 ) identify unit champion intervention unit utilized persuade nurse implement innovation , 4 ) Weekly feedback nursing staff facilitate assessment management delirium . We test follow specific aim : A.1 : To determine whether intervention `` END DSD '' improve nurse detection management DSD . A.2 : To determine effect `` END DSD '' intervention patient clinical outcome , include duration delirium rate psychoactive medication . The study focus costly prevalent problem , utilizes novel approach via EHR clearly replicable across setting care . END-DSD potential significantly improve quality life decrease cost care : improve detection DSD ; increase use non-pharmacological management DSD ; shorten duration delirium hospital length stay ; decrease use inappropriate medication , thus mitigate complication DSD . This project build decade fund research clinical practice investigator , bring unique collaborative effort together innovative manner impact address problem DSD hospitalize old adult .</detailed_description>
