	<brief_summary>Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) method prevent HIV infection use antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication exposure HIV . This study evaluate safety tolerability four ARV regimens prevent HIV infection men sex men may risk get HIV infection sex woman may risk get HIV infection sex . The four ARV regimen evaluate maraviroc ( MVC ) , MVC plus emtricitabine ( FTC ) , MVC plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , TDF plus FTC . The MVC-containing arm compare TDF/FTC alone combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Tolerability Antiretroviral Drug Regimens Used Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Prevent HIV Infection At-Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men At-Risk Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical trial currently way evaluate safety efficacy ARV-based PrEP prevent HIV infection . In 2010 , result first efficacy trial ARV-based PrEP show 44 % few HIV infection among study participant receive study drug ( TDF FTC ) among receive placebo . Although result promise , concern poor adherence , drug resistance , toxicity prompt exploration ARV PrEP regimens . This trial evaluate safety tolerability PrEP use four ARV regimens reduce HIV transmission at-risk men sex men at-risk woman . Participants randomly assign one four arm : Arm 1 , Arm 2 , Arm 3 , Arm 4 . Arm 1 receive MVC , FTC placebo , TDF placebo orally daily Week 0 48 . Arm 2 receive MVC , FTC , TDF placebo orally daily Week 0 48 . Arm 3 receive MVC , FTC placebo , TDF orally daily Week 0 48 . Participants Arm 4 receive MVC placebo , FTC , TDF orally daily Week 0 48 . Study visit occur enrollment Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 49 . All study visit include physical examination , blood collection storage , HIV counsel test . Select study visit include adherence counseling , survey , behavioral assessment ( include sexual behavioral assessment ) , urine collection , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Participants also undergo sexual behavioral assessment randomly 12 13 time Week 48 via short message service ( SMS ) . Some female participant may opt take part interview Week 48 . Participants enroll study may also consent part two subset evaluation part study : Drug Interaction Subset Tissue Subset . Enrollment subsets involve additional study procedure . The Drug Interaction Subset undergo blood collection directly observe dose study drug Week 2 visit . Participants Tissue Subset take part additional study procedure select visit , include blood collection , hair collection , rectal tissue fluid collection ( require men ; optional woman ) . Women involve Tissue Subset also undergo cervical tissue cervicovaginal fluid collection select visit .</detailed_description>
