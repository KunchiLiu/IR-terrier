	<brief_summary>Mutations tumor-related gene dynamic . Gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell often obviously invasive case recurrence . The great majority relapse may associate secondary mutation GIST related gene . Full gene sequence c-KIT、PDGFRA DOG1 , extract specimen cell repeat surgical resection biopsy tissue GIST patient postoperative recurrence , analyze screening-sequencing approach , order investigate characteristic variation associate different gene mutation c-KIT、PDGFRA DOG1 GIST patient likely find evolutionary pattern , try learn fact effect tyrosine kinase inhibitor GIST relate gene , make survey association c-KIT、PDGFRA DOG1 gene mutation provide basis seek molecular marker GIST monitoring course disease , offer theoretical basis new therapeutic strategy application clinical treatment .</brief_summary>
