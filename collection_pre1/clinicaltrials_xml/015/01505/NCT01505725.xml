	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study behavioral component nicotine addiction look drug reinforce effect , connect stimulation provide drug ( nicotine ) behavior produce ( smoke ) . Based previous study , researcher interest learn nicotine affect current smoker ' response psychological test smoking-related cue , study whether certain kind genetic background may affect smoker ' response kind study . Objectives : - To compare effect nicotine versus denicotinized cigarette specific psychological test . - To compare effect smoke cue versus neutral cue crave , mood , autonomic response . - To study effect gene nicotine reinforcement smoking-cue reactivity . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 64 year age current smoker ( least 10 cigarette per day least 1 year ) currently interested reduce smoke seek treatment tobacco dependence . Design : - Pilot session : - Participants practice smoke use measure equipment use study . - After successful practice , participant read listen music 1 hour , allow smoke . - After 1-hour period , participant sample study cigarette different level nicotine , ask guess whether cigarette normal study cigarette denicotinized cigarette . - Baseline session : - Blood , urine , breath sample take start session . - Participants smoke part initial cigarette , read listen music 1 hour , allow smoke . - After 1-hour period , participant give another breath sample complete questionnaire mood concentration level . - Trial session : - Participants smoke study cigarette , ask either respond question perceive nicotine level cigarettes press lever chance reward additional puff cigarette . After session , participant give another breath sample complete questionnaire mood concentration level . - Participants also participate cue-reactivity session test body 's physiological response smoking cue ( pack cigarette ) neutral cue ( pack unsharpened pencil ) . After session , participant complete questionnaire mood concentration 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute session . - At conclusion last experimental session , participant discuss study researcher , may receive referral list smoking treatment program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Reinforcement Smoking-Cue Reactivity : Association With Genetic Polymorphisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 ) compare reinforce efficacy nicotine versus denicotinized cigarette use forced choice operant response procedure , 2 ) compare effect smoke cue versus neutral cue crave , mood , autonomic responsivity , 3 ) explore potential association several genetic polymorphism phenotypic measure nicotine reinforcement smoking-cue reactivity . Study population : 175 adult smoker ( 35 pilot study I , 60 pilot stufy II 80 main study ) . Design : Placebo-controlled , within-subjects design . Pilot study entail 1-2 session . Main study entail one baseline/adaptation session 5-10 experimental session . Outcome Measures : Behavioral Measures During forced-choice session , primary measure percentage nicotine cigarette puff choose take choice trial . During operant response session , primary measure include breakpoint ( final ratio complete ) , total number response , number cigarette puff earn take . During cue-reactivity session , primary measure include crave , mood , autonomic responsivity ( heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance , skin temperature ) . Genetic Measures The following genetic polymorphism assay : 1 ) C/T rs2023239 variant CB1R gene , 2 ) Ser/Gly rs6280 variant DRD3 gene , 3 ) variant CYP2A6 gene . Secondary Measures Secondary study measure include baseline smoke history , FTND , TCQ-SF , mood form , CO , urinary cotinine 3-hydroxycotinine . The ratio 3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine phenotypic biomarker rate nicotine metabolism , show associated CYP2A6 genotype , level nicotine dependence , various smoke behavior , treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
