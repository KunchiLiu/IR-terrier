	<detailed_description>Polyphenols ( plant chemical , produce purple red color fruit ) find strawberry associate reduce risk gum disease . However , much chemical susceptible degradation food processing digestion . Minimally degrade mouth , polyphenols consume fresh fruit retain brief period . Therefore , exposure fresh fruit polyphenols oral tissue may adequate biologic effect occur . At OSU , food scientist develop 6 gram strawberry gummy contain 3 gram freeze-dried strawberry design dissolve relatively slow mouth . The investigator investigate effect strawberry gummy consumption oral health 36 habitually smoke non-smoking healthy adult ( men woman ) . At enrollment visit ( Day-14 ) , subject visit OSU Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) oral brushing ; submit 24-hour urine collection , saliva sample . Subjects start anthocyanin-free ( avoid purple red fruit vegetable ) diet maintain 6 week study . After 2 week , subject first `` washout '' visit CRC . This visit one two `` washout visit '' subject submit sample ( fast blood , urine , saliva , oral brushing ) . At visit , smoker block randomize ( random assignment use computer software ) one two group ( strawberry placebo gummies ) match non-smoker gender age group . A salivary pharmacokinetic ( sPK ) study follow involve collection saliva time point : 5 minute gummy place mouth , 5,10,15,20,25 , 30 minute gummies mouth . Subjects instruct consume 2 piece strawberry , placebo gummy 4 time day 7 day . After 7 day subject return CRC `` treatment visit '' submit fast blood , urine , saliva oral brushing sample . Subjects repeat two-week anthocyanin-free diet return CRC another `` washout visit '' cross study gummy . After 7 day gummy consumption , subject return second treatment visit submit fast blood , oral brushing , saliva , 24 hour urine collection .</detailed_description>
