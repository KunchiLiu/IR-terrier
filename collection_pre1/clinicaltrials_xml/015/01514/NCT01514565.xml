	<brief_title>Tumor Suppressor Status Predictor Chemotherapy Response Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational cohort study , control group direct experimental intervention , patient 's pathological material use examine expression molecular biomarkers believe predict chemotherapy response . Patients locally advanced triple negative breast cancer , candidate neoadjuvant chemotherapy , enrol clinical study . Patients receive standard care , FDA-approved clinically validate chemotherapy regimen . The biopsy specimens take diagnostic phase ( pre-treatment specimen ) use specific biomarker evaluation . Data obtain pre-treatment phase compare surgical specimen ( post-treatment phase ) obtain receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The primary endpoint ass ability specific biomarkers predict treatment response , thus identify patient achieve benefit treatment .</detailed_description>
