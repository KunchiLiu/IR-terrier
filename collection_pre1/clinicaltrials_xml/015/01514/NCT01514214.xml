	<brief_summary>Strictures bile duct cause blockage flow bile . This lead potential problem include jaundice , itch infection bile duct . The usual first step situation would allow flow bile place stent across stricture . This usually do special type endoscopy procedure call endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , ERCP . The commonly use stent make plastic material call polyethylene central lumen bile drain . Health Canada approve sale use another stent wing perimeter ( VIADUCT stent ) placement bile duct stricture use routinely hospital . However , investigator know stent good treat bile duct stricture . In order determine stent would useful , VIADUCT stent usual polyethylene flanged stent must study carefully control circumstance . This do randomized , subject-blinded study . Other trial past look stent way , first time VIADUCT stent look manner . The investigator suspect design VIADUCT stent allow work longer period time compare traditional polyethylene stent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Winged Perimeter Versus Traditional Plastic Biliary Stent Malignant Bile Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary obstruction usually present jaundice , pruritis , cholangitis , steatorrhoea . Strictures common cause biliary obstruction , may secondary benign malignant condition . Common benign condition include chronic pancreatitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , autoimmune pancreatitis , prior surgery recurrent pyogenic cholangitis . Cholangiocarcinomas , ampullary pancreatic tumour common cause malignant biliary obstruction . The principle manage biliary stricture determine underlie cause stricture , whilst achieve drainage biliary tree , initially placement plastic stent via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Strictures sample use biliary brush cytology and/or biliary biopsy ass underlying malignancy . Malignant stricture usually stag resectability compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) and/or endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . The Viaduct stent ( GI Supply , Camp Hill , Pennsylvania , USA ) unique stent design wing perimeter , channel flow bile around stent , rather central lumen . Theoretically may enhance flow biliary drainage , prevent obstruction . Both polyethylene Viaduct plastic stent approve use Health Canada benign malignant biliary condition . It know whether one stent superior maintain symptomatic relief bile duct stricture study date compare two stent . There limited publish data Viaduct stent . A pilot study wing stent design publish 2006 . Five patient wing stent insert follow 2 week . The problem stent insertion symptom obstruction jaundice improve time . One study publish abstract form retrospectively compare 34 Viaduct stent match 240 `` conventional '' stent five year period . There statistical difference stent dysfunction , trend towards patency Viaduct stent . The primary aim study compare stent patency time Viaduct polyethylene stent group subject malignant bile duct stricture . The secondary aim determine etiology stent failure two treatment group , identify compare device-related adverse event two treatment group , identify patient factor associate stent failure , compare survival Viaduct polyethylene stent group .</detailed_description>
