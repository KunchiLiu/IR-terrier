	<criteria>Male female patient age ≥ 18 year old A performance status 0 , 1 , 2 , accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Histologically confirm adrenocortical carcinoma . Metastatic locally advance nonresectable disease . At least one radiologically measurable lesion , accord RECIST 1.1 . Adequate liver function show : serum plasma ALT AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN ( regardless presence absence metastasis ) serum plasma total bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Adequate bone marrow function show : blood absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 109/L hemoglobin ( Hb ) &gt; 9g/dL . Adequate renal function show serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Patients give write informed consent obtain accord local guideline . Prior chemotherapy mitotane ( Patients previously receive mitotane eligible drig withdraw least two week earlier dovitinib first dose administer ) . Patients another primary malignancy within 3 year prior start study drug , exception adequately treat insitu carcinoma uterine cervix , completely excise basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients receive radical radiotherapy ≤4 week prior start study treatment recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . Palliative radiotherapy bone lesion ≤2 week prior start study treatment allow . Patients undergone major surgery ( i.e. , intrathoracic , intrabdominal , intrapelvic ) ≤4 week prior start study treatment recover side effect therapy . Patients history pulmonary embolism ( PE ) within past 6 month untreated deepvenousthrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month . Adequately treated DVT permit provide patient anticoagulation least 2 week . Patients impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : History presence serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia . Clinically significant rest bradycardia . LVEF &lt; 45 % assess 2D echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) . ( No basal cardiac test mandatory ECG ) Any follow within 6 month prior start study treatment : Myocardial infarction ( MI ) , severe/unstable angina , Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) , Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) , Cerebrovascular Accident ( CVA ) , Transient Ischemic Attack TIA ) . Uncontrolled hypertension define SBP ≥160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥100 mm Hg , without antihypertensive medication . Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) allow prior study entry . Patients impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption Dovitinib ( TKI258 ) ( i.e. , severe ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , extensive ( &gt; 1m ) small bowel resection , inability swallow oral medication ) . Prior partial total gastrectomy exclusion criterion . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . HIV test mandatory . Patients currently receive full dose anticoagulation treatment therapeutic dos dicumarinical drug warfarin/acenocoumarol antiplatelet therapy ( i.e. , clopidogrel bisulfate ) . Treatment acetylsalicyclic acid 100mg daily allow , well prophylactic therapeutic lowweightheparin . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Women childbearing potential employ effective method birth control . Effective contraception ( e.g . condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) must use throughout trial 8 week end Dovitinib treatment . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Women childbearing potential define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) , must negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 day prior start study drug . Women childbearing potential employ willing use effective method birth control . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Fertile male willing use contraception state . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
