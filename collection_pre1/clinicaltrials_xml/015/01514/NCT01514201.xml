	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together radiation therapy temozolomide see well work treat young patient newly diagnose diffuse pontine glioma . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell either kill cell stop divide . Giving veliparib radiation therapy temozolomide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum-tolerated dose recommend Phase II dose ABT-888 ( veliparib ) safely administer concurrently radiation therapy , follow maintenance therapy ABT-888 TMZ ( temozolomide ) , patient newly diagnose diffuse pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . ( Phase I ) II . To study plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ABT-888 ABT-888 radiation therapy . ( Phase I ) III . To study feasibility intra-patient dose escalation TMZ maintenance therapy ABT-888 TMZ . ( Phase I ) IV . To describe toxicity associate administer ABT-888 radiation therapy , follow ABT-888 TMZ , patient newly diagnose DIPG . ( Phase I ) V. To estimate proportion newly diagnose DIPG patient treat protocol determine experienced pseudo progression . ( Phase I ) VI . To estimate overall survival distribution newly diagnose patient DIPG treat combination ABT-888 radiation therapy , follow ABT-888 TMZ , compare PBTC historical control . ( Phase II ) VII . To study feasibility intra-patient dose escalation TMZ maintenance therapy ABT-888 TMZ . ( Phase II ) VIII . To estimate proportion newly diagnose DIPG patient treat protocol determine experienced pseudo progression . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) distribution summarize best tumor response observe prior progression recurrence . II . To explore plasma PK ABT-888 ABT-888 radiation therapy . III . To explore peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP ) activity treatment ABT-888 . IV . To explore quantify non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) activity gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) level ( surrogate marker unrepaired double-strand break [ DSBs ] ) PBMC treatment ABT-888 . V. To explore quantify PARP activity deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) -repair protein level biopsied atypical pontine glioma , available . VI . To explore association molecular parameter secondary aim III , IV , V PFS overall survival ( OS ) conclusion clinical trial . VII . To explore quantitative magnetic resonance ( MR ) measure relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) , vascular permeability ( Ktrans , fractional plasma volume [ vp ] , extravascular extracellular space volume fraction [ ] value ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) within first six month initiate protocol treatment correlate disease outcome determine whether metric differentiate patient pseudo progression true early progressive disease . VIII . To explore potential utility urine biomarkers novel , non-invasive method detect track change status pediatric brain stem glioma . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow phase II study . DOSE-ESCALATION : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 5 day week 6-7 week . Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6-7 week . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 3-4 week later , patient receive veliparib PO BID day 1-5 temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
