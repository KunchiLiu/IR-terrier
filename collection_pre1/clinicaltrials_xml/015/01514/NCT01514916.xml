	<brief_summary>The medical device `` Vascular Join '' represent new anastomotic technology reduce inter-surgeons variability anastomosis construction increase performance term result . It allow perfect mechanical anastomosis without suture , avoid disadvantage operation length difficulty act , thrombosis , clamp embolism . The `` Vascular Join '' create automatically connection vein prosthesis end bridge artery prevent passage needle suture vessel wall clamping pressure . This make easy construct vascular anastomosis use endoscopic technique less traumatic patient , lessen pain patient , thereby reduce health care cost reduce length hospital stay . No part device contact patient 's blood whole system remain thickness arterial wall outside vessel . Thus , formation intimal hyperplasia greatly diminish risk occlusion anastomosis less currently available risk suture use . This risk show study animal labs , mean follow 12 month . The Vascular Join create perfect congruence anastomose vessel allows perfect match vascular tunic . The medical device Vascular Join design order : - Reduce suture time ; - Reduce risk occlusion vein surgical process ; - Avoid contact risk external material steel ( surgical needle ) blood ; - Standardize quality anastomosis independently skill surgeon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Anastomotic Device End End Vascular Anastomosis Treatment Peripheral Vascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Vascular Join consist two symmetrical part , call Vessel Rings , fix extremity two conduit join together . A third ring , call Coupler Ring , keep two ring together snap-on system guarantee continuity sever conduit end-to-end configuration . Each ring make within cylinder-type steel AISI 316L . The circular shape Vessel ring , inner part particular , provide natural physiologic vascular reconstruction reduce risk thrombosis myointimal hyperplasia anastomotic site . We propose evaluate ease use , efficiency , security `` Vascular Join '' long-term result ( 6 month ) patient peripheral vascular disease require vascular bypass . Each patient proximal anastomosis distal anastomosis perform `` Vascular Join '' . Next , measure flow bypass ultrasonic flow meter . The objective achieve vascular bypass use mechanical device describe define incidence major minor vascular complication postoperative 7 day ( discharge ) , well primary secondary permeability bypass 6 month . What define major vascular complication death , stroke , acute occlusion , partial occlusion , reoperation redo mechanical anastomosis . We define minor complication residual pain , bleed . In case partial complete failure mechanical suture , surgeon add point suture perform anastomosis traditional technique . After 6 month , Doppler allow u compare patient , morphology anastomosis perform `` Vascular Join , '' permeability bypass . The result compare historical result primary secondary permeability present literature . The 2 main objective study assess device still work 6 month ( call device 's performance ) safe standard technique ( run interrupt suture ) term incidence complication bleed , infection occlusion . Simple size therefore calculate term equivalence risk . In case null hypothesis specify success rate Pc standard treatment high success rate PE vascular join treatment least amount ß . The alternative hypothesis specifies PC - PE &lt; ß , imply 2 therapy equivalent . The following formula provide required number patient trial : Ho : PC &gt; ( = ) PE + ß v H1 : PC &lt; ( = ) PE + ß . Because , take historical data reference , incidence complication peripheral bypass could high 50 % 6 month , number 30 patient select . The post-operative treatment remote monitoring patient remain unchanged ( Aspirin 100 mg/d control angiological 3 6 month ) . Patient 's follow-up patient receive femoral artery bypass , mean physical examination Doppler ultrasound bypass discharge , 1 , 3 6 month procedure . If patient miss schedule control , PI apply procedure use Cardiovascular Surgery Dpt contact , include phone call patient , contact person he/her identified admission GP .</detailed_description>
