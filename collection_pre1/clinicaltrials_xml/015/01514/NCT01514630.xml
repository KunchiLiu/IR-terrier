	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine ( MA ) psychostimulant drug high abuse potential . MA smoke , snort , inject ingest orally produce release high level dopamine brain reduction dopamine uptake . Its use result feeling pleasure , increase energy , great alertness last 12 hour . In 2010 , National Survey Drug Use Health report 353,000 Americans age 12 older report current MA user . Over past decade MA use rate fluctuate current use rate decline ; however , importantly , even though overall use rate decline , use rate among male female approach equal proportion . This use rate pattern unlike drug abuse , typically demonstrate male use female . In state , female male consider MA drug choice . Namely , 2010 report state Utah , female diagnose MA primary substance abuse males upon admission treatment . Depression MA use highly comorbid . The relationship MA use depression likely bidirectional , MA use causing change mood used self-medicating behavior reduce symptom depression . Several study show depression rate higher MA-using female compare male counterpart . It likely neurobiological psychosocial mechanism contribute increase incidence depressive symptom female . No clear treatment model exist suggest comorbidity depression MA use best managed . In study antidepressant treatment MA withdrawal dependence , finding suggest antidepressant ineffective treat depressive symptom . Creatine organic acid occur naturally vertebrate , take part energy homeostasis tissue fluctuate energy demand . Exogenous creatine show increase brain concentration PCr . Neuroimaging study creatine show increased brain phosphocreatine ( PCr ) content creatine administration . Therefore , hypothesize oral creatine administration increase PCr level reduce depressive symptom sample depress female MA user . This hypothesis test within subject design give depressed MA use female oral creatine eight week measure PCr pre- post-treatment magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Moreover , depressive symptom measure administration Hamilton Depression Rating Scale twice weekly course creatine treatment .</brief_summary>
