	<brief_summary>Despite current antipsychotic treatment , majority people schizophrenia continue exhibit persistent positive negative symptom cognitive impairment . An alternative approach use psychotropic agent treatment persistent symptom use anti-inflammatory agent reverse pro-inflammatory state hypothesize underlie symptom sign manifestation illness . The investigator primary hypothesis add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy significant beneficial effect persistent positive symptom cognitive impairment . The investigator secondary hypothesis : 1. add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy associate improvement depressive negative symptom reduction pro-inflammatory cytokine 2. add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy compare placebo associate elevated adverse risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia hypothesize due , part , disruption normal immune system inflammatory response viral bacterial infection stimuli system . Epidemiological clinical study provide extensive evidence perinatal exposure infection contribute etiology schizophrenia . The recent report association marker single nucleotide polymorphisms locate within major histocompatibility complex chromosome 6p22.1 schizophrenia provide support etiological hypothesis immune system dysfunction schizophrenia . There large number report suggest people schizophrenia alter cytokine level , one study report elevated level pro-inflammatory cytokine : IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-12 , CRP , IFN-γ , TNF-α ; reduce level anti-inflammatory cytokine : IL-10 . In study examine use combination anti-inflammatory therapy intervention patient schizophrenia . We use 1 . Salsalate , 4 gm/day . Salsalate potent inhibitor nuclear transcription factor NF-κB activation . NF-κB activated pro-inflammatory cytokine ; 2 . Omega-3-fatty acid eicosapentaenoic ( EPA ; 2 gm/day ) docosahexaenoic ( DHA ; 2 gm/day ) . Omega-3-fatty acid exert anti-inflammatory effect oxygenation resolvins protectins , potent anti-inflammatory agent ; 3 . Fluvastatin , 40 mgs/day . Fluvastatin lipid-lowering drug , act inhibition 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase ( HMG-CoA ) . Fluvastatin may also exert anti-inflammatory effect independent lipid-lowering effect via mechanism involve HMG-CoA inhibition decrease NF-κB activation . We choose use combination therapy three different class anti-inflammatory agent address potential benefit therapeutic approach persistent positive symptom cognitive impairment . The three agent unique anti-inflammatory mechanism action , believe offer robust evaluation therapeutic approach maximize likelihood elicit pronounced therapeutic effect .</detailed_description>
