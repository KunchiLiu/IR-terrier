	<brief_summary>Constructing learn curve ultrasound guide needling Observational study - How many attempt , continuous train feedback , in-plane ultrasound guide needling phantom model require attain competence ? The use ultrasound enable real-time needle visualisation regional anaesthesia ( place local anaesthetic , via needle , near nerve result numb area body operate ) gain popularity recent year . It recognise NICE ( National Institute Clinical Excellence ) guideline train publish , UK equivalents pending . These call training technique model 'phantoms ' prior patient contact . It unknown much experience necessary attain competence phantom , prior proceed patient contact . One study look experiential learning technique find wide range experience need individual . In order study effect change train method learn technique necessary baseline learn curve . The investigator introduce training package anaesthetists new technique meet recommendation initial phantom base training . Alongside investigator aim gather prospective observational data allow investigator generate learn curve technique . This involve make video record ultrasound image approximately 50 sequential attempt perform task phantom , ongoing instruction coaching . The whole training package take approximately 1 hour . These video clip review sequential attempt grade quality needle visualisation task completion . This allow investigator use statistical method , Cumulative Sum ( Cusum ) analysis , determine many attempt require attain proficiency . The investigator hope recruit approximately 20 participant pilot study , determine average amount training necessary attain proficiency . Using Cusum analysis require use acceptable failure rate , usually choose arbitrarily . To add great mean finding investigator also invite anaesthetist experience technique in-plane ultrasound guide needling participate . By measure actual success rate local trainer investigator able make meaningful comparison training require achieve similar level success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION The use ultrasound tool guide regional anaesthesia grow popularity use . The National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) acknowledge role ultrasound regional anaesthesia issue guidance govern incorporation clinical practice . The focus guidance adoption ultrasound properly train practitioner set adequate clinical governance , consent audit . [ 1 ] Trainees anaesthesia expect become familiar regional anaesthetic technique , increasingly involve use ultrasound . Of paramount importance acquisition skill needle visualisation ultrasound guidance real time . There grow consensus trainee undergo period training phantom prior perform technique patient [ 2 , 3 ] . Given increase use ultrasound regional anaesthesia within trust , together recognition requirement adequate formal training use plan introduce program phantom base training ultrasound needle visualisation control trainees prior commence clinical practice . 1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY The amount training require achieve competency , phantom model clinical practice unknown . Some work do use cumulative sum ( CUSUM ) method several different anaesthetic related practical procedure . These show individual learning curve vary greatly , however CUSUM method show promise technique determine acquisition competence . [ 4 , 7 ] Unsurprisingly also suggest provide training , phantom practice , improve success rate skill acquisition [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . In order conduct future work effect intervention train method learn curve regional anaesthesia baseline learn curve need construct . As part plan train program intend collect observational data enable construction baseline learn curve attainment competence ultrasound needle visualisation . One weaknesses previous attempt incorporate CUSUM training analysis need arbitrarily select value acceptable unacceptable failure rate . We hope address study simultaneously determine local failure rate technique amongst proficient practitioner , apply data CUSUM analysis data collect novice training . In order provide pragmatic data applicable average anaesthetic department define proficient practitioner , purpose calculate acceptable failure rate , anaesthetists routinely incorporating in-plane ultrasound guide needle visualisation practice teach others . The investigator suggest provide novice instruction practice process , rather allow 'discovery learn ' approach previously study [ 4 ] , result low total narrow spread attempt require attain competence . By use measure acceptable failure rate add validity data . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective - Determine amount training require ( number attempt ) attain statistical proficiency average anaesthetist . Secondary outcome - Determine effect prior experience demographic factor rate skill acquisition . Determine whether trainer assessment predict statistical outcome . 3 . STUDY DESIGN The propose study prospective observational study . We aim recruit 20 participant pilot study . Methods - Anaesthetists within department invite participate short train observational exercise . Participants ask consent advance ultrasound image practice attempt record anonymously subsequently assess . Refusal consent preclude take part training desire . Participants ask provide background demographic data subject may expect effect rate skill acquisition . This include age , sex , grade anaesthetist , prior experience in-plane ultrasound guide needling ( regional anaesthesia vascular access ) , exposure computer gaming . ( See Appendix ) Participants ask declare level experience 1 . New in-plane ultrasound guide needling . Little experience technique . 2 . Some exposure in-plane ultrasound guide needling . Infrequent use clinical practice . 3 . Regularly incorporate in-plane ultrasound guide needling clinical practice . Teaching technique others . Experience gain Ultrasound Guided Regional Anaesthesia vascular access technique deem valid . All participant , irrespective previous experience , complete training / observational package detail . Training session run one one basis local Fellow Regional Anaesthesia . Participants spend approximately 15 minute view brief powerpoint presentation introduce principle ultrasound follow machine orientation instruction needle handle visualisation technique . The trainer demonstrate technique . Participants spend approximately 45 minute hand practice needle handle visualisation perform task standardise gelatin base phantom . Instruction feedback provide throughout , aim develop demonstrate skill maintain needle tip visualisation time advance towards contact target . It anticipate participant undertake approximately 50 needle pass time . For attempt participant ask advance needle ultrasound guidance toward target , maintain constant needle visualisation best ability . A brief period initial shallow insertion locate needle ultrasound permit , partial withdrawal re-alignment needle . A fresh puncture phantom regard next attempt . Once participant feel optimise needle position contact target trainer ensure optimal needle visualisation exclude tip placement within traverse target . The needle withdrawn participant proceeds next attempt . We use Sonosite M-Turbo ultrasound machine HFL38X 6-13MHz linear probe Sonoplex 80mm 20G needle . Ultrasound image record digitally use `` iGrabber '' USB video capture device onto laptop computer . Recording start immediately prior needle insertion . Once participant optimise needle position attempt image frozen indicate end point , unfrozen visualisation needle optimise trainer ( participant maintain static needle position ) withdrawal needle , record stop . The process repeat subsequent attempt . At end period training participant rating within group 1 trainer record whether feel participant demonstrate competence , later comparison CUSUM analysis . Following period train observation anonymised video recording participant attempt export review two consultant anaesthetist , experience ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia . Each needle pas assess , sequence , grade previously agree criterion base previously publish system [ 4 ] ( appendix ) . Sequential grade information participant collate . Data participant group 3 used calculate actual failure rate anaesthetist within department consider competent enough teach technique . This use acceptable failure rate generate CUSUM chart participant group 1 ass attainment competence . If desire information subsequently feed back participant , play part determine progress training practice . 3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES The outcome indication amount training require attain competence average novice anaesthetist , validate use measure success rate already deem competent work within department . 4 .
