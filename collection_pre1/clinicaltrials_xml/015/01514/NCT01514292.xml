The primary objective characterize System performance respect laboratory reference venous sample measurement . The device performance primarily evaluate term point rate accuracy G4 System reference YSI . Safety G4 System characterize Adverse Device Effects Serious Adverse Device Effects experience study participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Study Dexcom G4â„¢ Continuous Glucose Monitoring System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective characterize System performance respect laboratory reference venous sample measurement . The device performance primarily evaluate term point rate accuracy G4 System reference YSI . The trend accuracy device performance , i.e. , continuous glucose error grid analysis , evaluate well temporal G4 System accuracy different glucose rate change different glucose range ( hypoglycemic , euglycemic , hyperglycemic range ) . The primary matched pair ( Sensor-YSI ) measurement collect multiple in-clinic day .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 18 year old ; Diagnosed diabetes mellitus ; Use one follow diabetes management : intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) nonintensive insulin therapy ( nonIIT ) Intensiveinsulin use ( IIT ) subject During inclinic session , willing blood glucose level manipulate high low glucose level . Subjects IIT observe inclinic session . For subject exercise routinely ( least 3 time per week ) , willing exercise inclinic session , ask ; Willing take minimum 7 fingersticks per day home use day ; Willing refrain use acetaminophen sensor wear period day prior sensor insertion ; Have extensive skin changes/diseases preclude wear require number device normal skin ( e.g. , extensive psoriasis , recent burn severe sunburn , extensive eczema , extensive scarring , extensive tattoo , dermatitis herpetiformis ) propose wear site ; Have know allergy medicalgrade adhesive ; Are pregnant demonstrate positive pregnancy test within 72 hour sensor insertion , Are dialysis ; Have hematocrit less 36 % great 55 % screening visit ; Currently participate another investigational study protocol ( subject recently complete participation another drug study , subject must complete study least 30 day prior enrol study ) ; Have history cardiovascular disease ( include , limited ischemic heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , cardiomyopathy , cerebrovascular disease , congenital heart disease , significant arrhythmia ) , epilepsy , severe migraine past 6 month , adrenal disease , syncope , significant hypoglycemia unawareness , history severe hypoglycemia ( require emergency medical intervention ) within last 6 month ; Have chronic infectious disease intercurrent illness would interfere participation study pose excessive risk study staff handle venous capillary blood sample ( e.g . HIV/AIDS , Hepatitis B C ) ; Have MRI scan , CT scan , diathermy schedule week study . If procedure require urgently study , subject notify study staff , end CGM session , remove sensor .</criteria>
