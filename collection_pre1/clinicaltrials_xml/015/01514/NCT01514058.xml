	<brief_summary>Patients present obstructive jaundice due malignant stricture often undergo battery test diagnosis , treatment option , prognosis . An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) often perform biliary stent placement symptom relief well brush cytology . An endoscopic ultrasound perform well fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) pancreas aid diagnosis . However , since EUS available many center , patient often undergo initial ERCP procedure stent placement ( widely available ) prior referral EUS . It report biliary stent disturb EUS visualization due inflammation , acoustic shadowing , pneumobilia may lessen accuracy diagnosis.1 The cytological yield EUS FNA procedure may also compromise patient biliary stent . As , diagnosis treatment option may delay . One retrospective study 65 subject show significant difference number correctly stag pancreatic head cancer ( mainly T stage ) patient without stent versus biliary stent ( 85 % vs 47 % ) .2 A second retrospective study conclude tissue diagnosis influence patient stent place great 24 hour EUS ; however , patient stent place prior EUS ( less 24 hour ) likely indeterminate results.1 Although finding suggestive , study limit retrospective design question yet address prospective study . Both procedure require anesthesia , perform sequentially set , duration anesthesia prolong . This concern patient since complication may theoretically increase prolonged anesthesia . However , retrospective review tertiary referral center show combined EUS ERCP yield complication rate higher component procedures.3 At institution , current practice sequentially perform EUS ERCP set patient suspect malignant biliary obstruction . Typically , EUS-FNA perform first , follow ERCP . Hypothesis We hypothesize perform ERCP biliary stenting immediately prior EUS-FNA decrease diagnostic yield EUS-FNA diminish ability EUS accurately stage pancreas tumor . Conversely , perform EUS-FNA prior ERCP increase biliary cannulation time increase success rate . The objective study follow : 1 . Determine diagnostic yield EUS-FNA ( diagnosis cancer v benign process ) perform either immediately ERCP biliary stenting ( primary outcome ) 2 . Determine ability EUS accurately stage pancreatic mass ( T N stag ) perform either immediately ERCP biliary stenting ( secondary outcome ) comparison gold standard surgical pathology post resection comparison CT finding ( patient surgical candidate ) 3 . Determine biliary cannulation time ( time take successfully pass wire common bile duct start procedure ) success rate place biliary stent ERCP perform either immediately EUS-FNA ( secondary outcome )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must able review sign informed consent . Subjects must require biliary stenting relief symptom well FNA biopsy proper diagnosis . Suspected mass locate head , uncinate , neck pancreas . Can give sign inform consent . The suspected mass locate body tail pancreas . The patient may candidate palliative biliary stenting ( metal stent would place )</criteria>
