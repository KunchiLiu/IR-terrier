	<brief_title>Trebananib And Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) safety profile AMG 386 ( trebananib ) combination temsirolimus patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect drug administer combination , goal identify potential predictive PD marker need exploration validation future trial . II . To explore preliminary anti-tumor activity drug administer RP2D patient advance endometrial cancer , renal cell carcinoma , carcinoid tumor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study trebananib . Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute temsirolimus IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
