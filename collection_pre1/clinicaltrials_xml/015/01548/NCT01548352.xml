	<brief_summary>Syncope major health problem . In emergency department ( ED ) , management patient syncope still remain clinical challenge underlie disease prognosis extremely various . Structural heart disease primary electrical disorder major risk factor sudden cardiac death mortality patient syncope . In contrast , patient reflex syncope exclusion structural heart disease excellent prognosis . Therefore The investigator test hypothesis use meticulous patient history , clinical examination novel biomarkers improve rapid accurate diagnosis cardiac syncope patient present ED able improve risk stratification regard adverse outcome . The prospective multicenter cohort study design enroll 720 patient present transient loss consciousness within last 12 hour ED . Blood sample measurement novel biomarkers obtain presentation . All patient contact phone 6 , 12 24 month determine major adverse event ( death , resuscitation , recurrence syncope , hospitalization syncope ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAsel Syncope EvaLuation ( BASEL IX ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Management patient syncope serious problem concern 1-2 % emergency department ( ED ) visit . In 6-20 % , syncope due cardiac origin . The rapid accurate identification patient important unmet clinical need . Aim : The aim study evaluate diagnostic value patient 's history , clinical judgement novel biomarkers , alone combination , diagnosis risk stratification patient &gt; 40 year age present syncope ED . Patients Methods : This prospective , observational , international multicenter study initially design enroll 720 adult patient &gt; 40 year present ED syncope within last twelve hour . Patient history standardize use predefined form . Treating physician ask quantify clinical judgment regard presence cardiac syncope . Digital 12-lead ECG record presentation store electronically . Blood sample measurement novel cardiovascular biomarkers ( include copeptin , pro-endothelin-1 , pro-adrenomedullin , natriuretic peptide high-sensitive cardiac troponins ) obtain presentation store anonymized . Patients contact phone 6 , 12 24 month determine major adverse event ( death , resuscitation , recurrence syncope , hospitalization syncope ) result follow-up examination . The final diagnosis adjudicate two independent expert review document pertain individual patient 6 month . The primary endpoint ass performance standardize form patient 's history , clinical judgment biomarkers , alone combination , diagnosis cardiac syncope , adjudicate two independent expert . Secondary endpoint include accuracy cite item prognostic stratification determination cost-effectiveness best approach . Clinical significance : A accurate rapid diagnosis risk stratification cardiac syncope significantly improve patient management therefore reduce patient morbidity treatment cost . Overall , expect study provide novel insight , hold important scientific , clinical economic implication .</detailed_description>
