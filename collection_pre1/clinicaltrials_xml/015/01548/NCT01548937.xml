	<brief_title>Serotonin Transporter Density Late-life Depression With Without Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression dementia two common psychiatric disorder elder subject . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) frequent cause dementia 20 % depression . Depression subject associate rapid cognitive decline , poor response treatment . Post mortem study show close relationship AD disruption serotonergic system , include loss serotnergic neuron brain stem . However , alternation presynaptic serotonin function relative demented non-demented subject remain investigated living subject . In study , investigator collect 40 elder subject ( i.e. , age equal 50 year old ) . The serotonin transporter activity compare subject without dementia use I-123 ADAM image . The single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) compare recent ( within 6 month ) F-18 FDG PET image investigation .</detailed_description>
