	<brief_title>The Role Human Milk Development Breast Fed Child 's Intestinal Microbiota</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal propose study establish link among mother ' nutrition , human milk LCPUFAs composition microbiota potential influence child 's gut microbiota development . Since information mothers´ diet , microbiota fatty acid composition human milk , faecal microbiota infant possible mechanism eventual transfer microorganisms mother child need establish connection . In addition , influence vitamine D level maternal blood bone mineral density neonate determine first year life . The dietary fatty acid composition plasma lipid blood pregnant woman assess . Mothers respective infant recruit maternity hospital three Slovenian region : Ljubljana , Murska Sobota Izola . Pregnant woman invite participate study informative leaflet first visit health care centre gynaecological clinic . All pregnant woman express interest participate fulfil participation criterion invite introductory meeting inform study get 1-hour course , instruction write 4-day weighed dietary protocol . The meeting carry select regional maternity hospital . All volunteer willing participate study get possibility get opinion diet pregnancy well later , lactation period . The volunteer pregnant woman also ask precisely register every probiotic food product food supplement eat last three month pregnancy 4 week delivery . Informed consent : The study describe pregnant woman principal investigator and/or co-investigators . Following explanation , interested pregnant woman give write description study approve informed consent sign . One copy sign document provide mother one copy retain record clinical study . The mother respective infant fulfil participation criterion research receive write instruction especially design health care diary follow child 's first year health performance . The mother give second third day delivery , supervision medical staff , sample colostrum . If available , sample infant´ meconium take time . Both sample subject analysis microbiota . Samples mature human milk take supervision medical staff first visit paediatrician , i.e . 4 week delivery ( determination fatty acids microbiota ) , 12th 14th week delivery . Mothers ask bring also sample child 's faeces . Cooperation researcher respective paediatrician health care centre responsible infant involve study also establish order get insight basic data development health infant . All infant follow birth age 12 month accord : ) growth , b ) feeding regime , c ) development ) bone mineral density e ) health . During first 12 month life examination take part six occasion : - Immediately birth first three day life - At first month ( age 28 38 day ) - At third month ( age 80 100 day ) - At sixth month ( age 110 130 day ) - At ninth month ( age 260 280 day ) - At twelfth month age ( age 355 375 day ) . For follow growth , development health standard paediatrics ' protocol use . Feeding regime annotate : - exclusively breast feed ( BF ) - partially BF ( BF + formula ) - formula . Data gather maternity department medical chart , regular paediatric health care visit dispensary especially design health care diary mother keep end child 's first year . The researcher responsible collect keep record data volunteer involve , diary data obtain paediatrician health care centre . Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCP ) , especially docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , C22:6n-3 ) play important role optimal development maturation nervous system . Adequate supply LCP , especially DHA , play important role period accelerate growth differentiation fetal nervous system last trimester pregnancy first year life . Recently new Consensus recommendation dietary fat intake pregnancy lactation issue . We aim investigate whether dietary intake Slovenian pregnant lactate woman accordance new recommendation well dietary intake healthy . Special attention give consumption LCP probiotic ferment dairy product . The consumption probiotic food supplement register well . Pregnant woman ( n=300 ) three region Slovenia , i.e . Ljubljana surround area ( n=100 ) , Izola surround area ( n=100 ) Murska Sobota surround area ( n=100 ) , include study . Diet examine use 4-day weighed dietary protocol ( 4DP ) do twice : 1. pregnancy : last third pregnancy ( 27th 28th week pregnancy ) 2. breast-feeding : 4 week delivery Objectives : - investigate weather nutrition pregnant lactate Slovenian woman accordance Central European dietary guideline - investigate whether nutrition pregnant lactate Slovenian accordance recent consensus recommendation dietary fat intake pregnancy lactation - evaluate frequency consumption probiotic product ( data important screen breast milk presence commercially important probiotic ) During study mother continue ordinary diet . For participate woman , lecture one-hour course practical example demonstration use balance example food , write 4-day weigh dietary protocol ( 4DP ) organise . After evaluation diary , mother also possibility ask expert opinion diet pregnancy well lactation . At University Medical Centre Ljubljana , Division Paediatrics , collect data evaluate help computer program Prodi 5.2 Expert plus ( Stuttgart , Germany ) . Energy express daily intake kcal MJ . Nutrient intake express ( micro ) grams/day , carbohydrate , protein fat intake also express percentage contribution daily energy intake . The intake sea fish fatty acid , especially DHA well intake probiotic product also precisely evaluate . The nutrition pregnant breast-feeding mother compare Central European reference intake , D-A-CH ( D-German , A-Austrian ; CH-Swiss ) Reference Values Nutrient Intake official Slovenia since 2004 . The intake fat , especially DHA , compare recent consensus recommendation fat intake pregnancy lactation . As D-A-CH Reference Values define maximum amount daily sodium sugar intake , compare sodium sugar intake joint WHO/FAO recommendation ( population nutrient intake goal sodium : &lt; 2 g/day free sugar : &lt; 10 % daily energy intake ) . The proportion n-3 LCP plasma lipid pregnant woman compare diet . The blood obtain pregnant woman analyse content D vitamine fatty acid composition plasma lipid . The purpose additional test - establish whether consumption marine fish well supplement contain fish oil unicellular organism n-3 LCP ( EPA DHA ) ( capsule , syrup ) , pregnancy affect increase n-3 LCP plasma lipid , - ass influence dietary factor bone mineral density woman , influence level vitamin D blood mother bone mineral density neonate . Among pregnant woman include study diet pregnant breast-feeding mother Slovenia , 40 mother region randomly select , evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion , investigation fatty-acid composition microbial composition human milk well analysis faecal microbiota infant . Objectives : - assessment fatty acid composition human milk , emphasis LCPUFAs - investigation correlation dietary DHA intake ( 4DP ) content ( wt . % ) mature human milk - assessment microbial diversity human colostrum milk microbiota , emphasis bifidobacteria lactic acid bacteria - potential probiotic - assessment prevalence bacteriocin produce lactic acid bacteria natural microbiota human colostrum milk - assessment microbial diversity child 's meconium faeces - comparison milk child 's faecal microbiota Statistic evaluation final result perform independent statistician Institute Biostatistics Medical informatics already include preparation protocol clinical study ( WP1 ) .</detailed_description>
