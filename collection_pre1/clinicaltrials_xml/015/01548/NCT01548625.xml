	<brief_summary>Purpose : A grow body epidemiological data suggests increase risk cardiovascular event associate air pollutant . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) implicate potential mechanism adverse effect air pollutant genetic polymorphism glutathione-s-transferases ( GSTs ) show participate antioxidant defense air pollutant . This study examine dose effect diesel exhaust exposure cardiovascular system healthy middle-aged subject . Participants : Six healthy 50-75 year-old male female subject GSTM1 null genotype 3 sequential exposure diesel exhaust concentration approximately 100 µg/m3 , 200 µg/m3 , 300 µg/m3 2 hour 2 week interval exposure .</brief_summary>
