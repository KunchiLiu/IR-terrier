	<brief_summary>Background : Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) rare , complex multisystem genetic disorder arise lack expression paternally inherit imprint gene chromosome 15q11-q13 . The syndrome include severe neonatal hypotonia impair suckle leading failure thrive severe case , subsequently follow early onset morbid obesity insatiable hunger , combine endocrine dysfunction probably due hypothalamic dysfunction . The pathophysiological mechanism occurrence 2 main nutritional phase PWS unknown . A deficit oxytocin ( OT ) -producing neuron paraventricular nucleus brain patient report . In addition well-known anorexigenic effect , OT involve establish maintain social code . Indeed , recently show double blind placebo study , OT administration adult patient PWS significantly decrease depressive mood tendency tantrums increase trust others data trend decrease appetite high satiety . Moreover PWS mouse model generate MAGEL2 KO gene single OT injection 5 hr life prevent early death observe 50 % new born mouse recover normal suckling . Interestingly effect longer observe OT injection take place later . These data , OT deficit PWS , good tolerance OT effect intranasal administration adult patient PWS recent strike data obtain MAGEL2 mouse model , prompt u evaluate tolerance single administration intranasal OT PWS newborns possible effect suckle food intake . Nowadays diagnosis PWS do first month life country . At age , child still present poor suckle suggest OT may still efficient . Moreover adult patient PWS show OT improve typical behavioral trouble . Therefore first want evaluate tolerance intranasal administration OT 6 infant PWS genetically confirm effect suckling , milk intake weight gain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We want evaluate tolerance intranasal administration OT 6 infant PWS genetically confirm effect suckling , milk intake weight gain . The three first patient single nasal administration 2 IU Oxytocin , adverse event observe , 3 follow patient single nasal administration 4 IU Oxytocin . We monitor cardiac pulse , blood pressure , urine emission measure biological safety parameter ( glycemia , natremia kaliemia ) . Video perform 1 day drug administration 3 day order qualify suckle . Quantitative evaluation milk intake feed per day also evaluate . Biological parameter measure OT , ghrelin , others neuroendocrine hormone involve appetite regulation ( leptin , cortisol , insulin , GLP-1 , PYY , pancreatic polypeptide , orexin A , aMSH ) take advantage blood sample safety biological measurement . These infant stay 8 day ( less mean duration hospitalization infant ) data record phone 1 month final visit 3 month .</detailed_description>
