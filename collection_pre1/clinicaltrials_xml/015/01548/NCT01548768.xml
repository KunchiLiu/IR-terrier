	<brief_summary>For aim 1 , propose study perform 150 patient RA 25 subject without RA ( healthy volunteer ) function control . For aim 2 , 25 patient enrol aim 1 ( need treatment due increase RA activity despite current treatment ) recruit continue study additional 24 ( +/- 2 ) week ( 6 month ) . These patient receive TNF inhibitor addition current treatment open label protocol increase disease activity context standard care . The investigator hypothesize anti-TNF agent RA patient without heart disease adversely affect heart ( cause detrimental change heart structure function ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) shorten life expectancy compare general population . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , include heart failure ( HF ) , primary cause extra death RA . HF , general , result failure heart muscle pump adequately . In word heart muscle HF become `` weak '' . In patient without RA , heart muscle get large symptom HF appear . Contrary , patient RA reduce heart size reduce heart strength . This may mean RA pathway heart failure may different compare happen patient without RA . It possible - example - RA heart muscle become small becomes weak ( non-RA patient heart muscle become large becomes weak ) . It possible cell create inflammation joint may also heart muscle make small , thinner eventually weak . Patients RA nowadays treat variety medication joint inflammation . These medication powerful reduce risk permanent joint damage disability . However unknown effect medication heart size strength whether increase decrease risk cardiovascular disease heart failure . Among medication use RA medication call TNF inhibitor . They usually prescribe patient joint inflammation respond treatment first line medication Methotrexate . Data non-RA patient advanced heart failure suggest anti-TNF agent may help heart failure may even harmful . However , effect agent heart RA patient never directly study . Some observational study suggest RA patient treat TNF inhibitor low risk develop heart disease . Overall knowledge regard effect TNF inhibitor RA patient heart function limit .</detailed_description>
