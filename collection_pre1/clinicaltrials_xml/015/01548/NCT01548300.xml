	<detailed_description>In aim 1 , investigator propose establish feasibility effort Beijing , China , effort involve implementation novel exposure assessment methodology simultaneously ability execute key surrogate outcome measure importance cardiovascular risk CM disease . In Aim 2 , association functional cardiovascular risk variable [ insulin sensitivity , Blood Pressure , endothelial function ] acute sub-acute variation personal black carbon ambient particulate matter 2.5 level among 50 individual chronic cardiometabolic syndrome investigate . In Aim 3 , investigator examine potential biologic pathway importance propose functional outcome . Specifically investigator determine association ambient particulate matter 2.5 level alteration adipocytokines/inflammatory variable autonomic nervous system balance .</detailed_description>
