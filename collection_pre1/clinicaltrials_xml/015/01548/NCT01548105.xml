	<brief_summary>Data smoking POP conflicting . In study do Alnaif et al , smoke find associate severe POP . The author ' propose explanation smoke impairs tissue wound heal . Our primary objective document whether smoker pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) different non-smokers POP respect collagen biosynthesis breakdown use systemic marker collagen metabolism Vitamin C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Markers Collagen Metabolism Vitamin C Smokers Non-Smokers With Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue destructive disorder common smoker non-smokers . Alterations wound heal connective tissue turnover suggest mechanism , exact detail remain discovered . The synthesis subcutaneous collagen smoker specifically impede , smoker less collagen compare non-smokers . Jorgensen et al study show smoker tend less procollagen I N-propeptide ( PINP ) level blood , less vitamin C high level matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 ) , finding reverse smoke cessation . Since smoke one promoting modifiable factor development prolapse , understand effect support pelvic organ may help modify course POP condition future . Understanding connective tissue effect smoke use systemic marker collagen metabolism female smoker prolapse may help future management counseling patient . In addition , description marker collagen metabolism POP previously document .</detailed_description>
