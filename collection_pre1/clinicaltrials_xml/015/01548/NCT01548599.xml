	<detailed_description>Food insecurity HIV/AIDS two lead cause morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa inextricably link . Since food insecurity contributes increase HIV transmission risk high HIV-related morbidity mortality , WHO , United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , World Food Programme recommend integrate sustainable food production strategy HIV/AIDS programming . Yet , date study systematically evaluate impact promise food security intervention health , economic behavioral outcome among people live HIV AIDS . To address gap , investigator plan test hypothesis multi-sectoral agricultural intervention deliver Nyanza Province , Kenya prevent highly active antiretroviral ( HAART ) treatment failure , reduce co-morbidities , decrease secondary HIV transmission risk . The intervention include : ) human-powered water pump require farm commodity , b ) micro-finance loan ( ~ $ 75 ) purchase pump agricultural implement , c ) education sustainable farming practice . To develop intervention , th investigator form interdisciplinary collaboration organization healthcare , agriculture , microfinance sector . Our study aim include : 1 . The investigator operationalize pilot test key design elements future cluster randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) aim improve health outcome among HAART-treated patient Western Kenya . In conjunction collaborate partner , investigator develop different component intervention , include : ) randomization procedure cluster RCT use detailed site assessment ; b ) agricultural training protocol ; c ) procedure control group ; ) manual operation . 2 . The investigator conduct pilot study agricultural intervention determine preliminary impact intervention mediate outcome ( food security , household economic indicator ) , primary health outcome interest plan RCT ( HIV treatment outcome , HIV transmission risk woman 's empowerment ) . Up one hundred sixty HIV-infected farmer HAART Western Kenya ( 80 intervention clinic 80 control clinic ) enrol follow 1 year . Impacts intervention mediate primary health outcome investigate separately jointly provide preliminary assessment possible direct indirect intervention effect . 3 . The investigator assess acceptability feasibility intervention control condition , systematically translate lesson learn pilot study design cluster RCT . To accomplish Aim 3 , investigator conduct mixed method process evaluation different intervention component implementation use quantitative , qualitative , observational method . The investigator prepare R01 grant submission base lesson learn . The ultimate goal work contribute sustainable solution tackle intersect challenge food insecurity , poverty , HIV/AIDS sub-Saharan Africa . The ultimate goal work contribute sustainable solution tackle intersect challenge food insecurity , poverty , HIV/AIDS sub-Saharan Africa .</detailed_description>
