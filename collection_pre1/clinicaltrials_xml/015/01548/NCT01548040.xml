	<brief_summary>The study double-blind randomize controlled clinical trial.Approximately 118 patient ( male female ) least 40 year age , schedule total-knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery randomize 1 ) treatment group receive Kneehab XP standard rehabilitation program 2 ) control group receive sham device standard rehabilitation program . Patients track measure function , pain , quality life , physical performance acceptable state status 6 week 1 week surgery 3 , 6 , 12 , 52 week follow surgery . Hypothesis 1 : The effect 12-weeks Kneehab XP ( peri-operative NMES ) combine standard rehabilitation patient undergo TKA surgery lead increase quadriceps strength compare control group 6 week post-operative time point . Hypothesis 2 : The effect 12-weeks Kneehab XP ( peri-operative NMES ) combine standard rehabilitation patient undergo TKA surgery well control group measure PASS post-operative week 6 . The investigator hypothesize significantly large proportion patient indicate positive PASS Kneehab XP group compare control group . Hypothesis 2 : The investigator hypothesize mean change score pain , physical functional performance measure significantly well Kneehab XP group post operative week 6 . Additionally , investigator report baseline correct score outcome , well primary secondary outcome , follow time point .</brief_summary>
