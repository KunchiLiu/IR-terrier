	<brief_title>Drug Therapy Surgery Congenital Heart Disease With Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) complicate factor management congenital heart disease ( CHD ) intracardiac extracardiac communication . In child moderate severe PAH , risk serious complication follow surgical repair shunt ( include right cardiac failure death ) 15-20 % even high , risk late , postoperative residual PAH ~25 % . We therefore intend conduct study aim reduce risk severe immediate postoperative complication risk residual PAH six month follow surgery le 10 % child moderate PAH ( primary objective ) . The study also aim promote statistically significant reduction pulmonary artery pressure pulmonary vascular resistance six month surgery , compare baseline child moderate severe PAH ( secondary objective ) . We hypothesize goal could achieve treat patient preoperatively six month postoperatively sildenafil , either singly combined bosentan . Both drug approve treatment PAH basis randomize clinical trial . Preoperative postoperative ( treatment ) hemodynamic evaluation base noninvasive invasive diagnostic procedure . As additional objective , intend analyze possible abnormality gene show associated PAH-CHD , inflammatory mediator well . The idea investigate whether change marker correlate clinical profile response treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Potentially operable patient congenital cardiac septal defect ( biventricular physiology ) PAH , must least three follow severity criterion : age &gt; 18 month ; absence congestive heart failure ( pulmonary congestion ) ; Down syndrome ; bidirectional shunting across septal defect ; period systemic ( peripheral ) oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % . Patients complex cardiac anomaly possibility complete repair . Patients univentricular physiology .</criteria>
