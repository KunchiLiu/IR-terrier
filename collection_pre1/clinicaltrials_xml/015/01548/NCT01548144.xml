	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Xalkori ( crizotinib ) either Votrient ( pazopanib ) Alimta ( pemetrexed ) combination 3 study drug give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Crizotinib design block protein call ALK , involve cancer cell growth survival . Pazopanib design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient need tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Pemetrexed design block protein may cause tumor grow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study group : Dose escalation : If find eligible take part study , doctor decide receive one follow drug combination : - If Group A , receive crizotinib pazopanib . - If Group B , receive crizotinib pemetrexed . - If Group C , receive pazopanib pemetrexed . - If Group D , receive crizotinib , pazopanib , pemetrexed . Once decided combination receive , assign dose level base join study . Up 8 dose level crizotinib pazopanib test . Up 6 dose level crizotinib pemetrexed test . Up 6 dose level pazopanib pemetrexed test . Up 8 dose level pazopanib pemetrexed crizotinib test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination find . Dose expansion : Once high tolerable dose study drug combination find , 14 participant may enrol study safety combination drug dose . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . Drugs take and/or administer simultaneously . On day pharmacokinetic testing ( agree ) take drug least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If take crizotinib , take mouth time every day consistently either without food . It swallow whole glass water . You take drug every day , 1 2 time day . You tell often take drug . If take pazopanib , take mouth time every day glass water . You take least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If receive pemetrexed : - You receive vein Day 1 cycle 10 minute . - The day first dose pemetrexed , start take folic acid help low risk side effect . Although study drug design prevent body make folic acid could help cancer grow spread , folic acid need prevent side effect non-cancerous tissue . You take folic acid mouth 1 time every day least 30 day receive last dose pemetrexed . - The day first dose pemetrexed , receive vitamin B12 injection . You receive injection Vitamin B12 every 9 week . Vitamin B12 give help reduce risk side effect . - You take dexamethasone mouth 2 time day day , day , day receive pemetrexed . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask drug herbal supplement take side effect may . During Cycles 1 2 , weekly blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history record , include cancer symptom . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , ECG check heart function . Every 6 week , earlier need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . After 6 week every 2-3 cycle , CT scan , x-ray , MRI scan , and/or PET scan check status disease . It may do often study doctor think need . If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test every 2 cycle time study doctor think need . Length Study Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing and/or follow-up visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . If side effect time visit , may follow-up long period time . At visit , follow test procedure may perform : - Your medical history record , include cancer symptom . - You ask side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . - If doctor think need , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , ECG check heart function . This investigational study . Crizotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment locally advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . Pazopanib FDA approve commercially available treatment advance renal cell carcinoma . Pemetrexed FDA approve commercially available treatment non-small cell lung cancer . The combination crizotinib pazopanib , crizotinib pemetrexed , pazopanib pemetrexed , give 3 drug together patient advance cancer investigational . Up 364 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients advanced cancer , either refractory standard therapy effective standard therapy increase survival least 3 month available . 2 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease , define RECIST 1.1 . 3 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 2 . 5 . Adequate organ function : ( Crizotinib plus Pazopanib arm A ) : Neutrophils &gt; 1000/uL ; Platelets â‰¥ 75,000/uL ; Total bilirubin &lt; or= 2 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) ; ALT &lt; = 2.5 x ULN &lt; r= 5 x ULN liver metastasis persist ; Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN ( Crizotinib plus Pemetrexed arm B , Pazopanib plus Pemetrexed arm C , Crizotinib plus Pazopanib plus Pemetrexed arm D ) Neutrophils &gt; 1500/uL ; Platelets &gt; = 100,000/uL ; Total bilirubin &lt; = 2 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) ; ALT &lt; = 2.5 x ULN &lt; = 5 x ULN liver metastasis persist ; Calculated GFR &gt; 45 mL/min . 6 . Creatinine Clearance : The standard Cockcroft Gault formula must use calculate CrCl enrollment dosing . Also include pretreatment baseline text portion protocol , 'On Study Evaluations During Treatment ' every Pemetrexed treatment day , also capture study Schedule Events . No dosage adjustment need patient creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min . Insufficient number patient study creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min give dose recommendation . Therefore , Pemetrexed administer patient whose creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min . 7 .
