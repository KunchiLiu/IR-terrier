	<brief_summary>It know acute stress organism often lead hyperglycemia even nondiabetic patient . It also know pathophysiological mechanism : enhance gluconeogenesis , impaired insulin secretion decrease insulin sensitivity due anti-insulin effect stress hormone proinflammatory cytokine , change glucose excretion renal tubular resorption . Many study prove negative effect hyperglycemia different tissue organ , e.g . hearth ( increase size myocardial necrosis , reduce coronary collateral blood flow , exaggerate ischemia-reperfusion injury , impair ischemic preconditioning ) , vascular ( increase risk thrombosis , endothelial dysfunction , activation systemic inflammation destabilization atherosclerotic plaque ) , kidney association infectious complication . The first Leuven study ( publish 2001 ) demonstrate hyperglycemia critical care patient significantly increase risk organ complication total mortality .

	<detailed_description>It long time well know phenomenon acute stress organism induce instance extensive surgery often lead hyperglycemia , even patient without previous history diabetes . Also well known common pathophysiological mechanism , responsible , enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis , impaired insulin secretion decrease insulin sensitivity due anti-insulin effect stress hormone proinflammatory cytokine , change glucose excretion higher renal tubular resorption . Many study prove negative effect elevate blood glucose level different tissue organ . Even short-term hyperglycemia find markedly impair cardiovascular function ischemic heart , increase size myocardial necrosis , reduce coronary collateral blood flow , exaggerate ischemia-reperfusion cellular injury and/or impair ischemic preconditioning . Also study identify numerous hyperglycemia-induced abnormality increase risk thrombosis , endothelial disfunction activation systemic inflammation , possible destabilization atherosclerotic plaque lead acute ischemic syndrome . Hyperglycemia also effect extent renal injury , e.g . patient cardiac surgery , last least , hyperglycemia associate increase postoperative infectious complication . Despite fact hyperglycemia recently consider `` protective '' mechanism patient critical condition , cell offer supranormal amount easily accessible energy . This approach radically change thanks Leuven study publish prof.Van den Berghe colleague 2001 New England Journal Medicine . This fundamental study prove high level blood glucose intensive care patient significantly increase risk organ complication well overall death rate , , contrary , significantly decrease mortality , well amount organ complication connect critical state intensive insulin therapy aim keep normoglycemia . Such result confirm also another study prof.Van den Berghe colleague ( publish NEJM 2006 ) , time perform non-surgery patient . This fact quickly accept intensivists therefore nowadays commonplace u carefully monitor blood glucose level postoperative ICU , keep normal level . Both above-mentioned study even significant cardiac surgery patient , since population patient first Leuven study ( 2001 ) , result intensive insulinotherapy distinct comparison non-surgery population ( 2006 ) mostly thank 40 % reduced mortality , consist 63 % patient follow cardiac surgery . If normoglycemia commonplace postoperative intensive care , stability glycemia cardiac surgery usually neglect . There clear recommendation regard suitable start intensive control glycemia , whether surgery already surgery . We know postoperative hyperglycemia many negative effect organism , however , know yet whether peroperative rise blood glucose cardiac extensive surgery postoperative maintenance normoglycemia negative benefiting effect organism . Until , yet valid study perform would answer concrete question . THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT : The goal study prove whether full perioperative intensive control glycemia , occurrence organ complication decrease even significantly postoperative normalization hyperglycemia , already prove publish study . This propose study aim complement fundamental Leuven study perioperative data therefore answer question , start control glycemia intensify insulinotherapy patient undergo cardiac surgery . A decisive factor success project also quality protocol glycemia control perioperative care . During previous year number various insulin protocol less successfully tried keep level blood glucose normoglycemia . Thanks European study CLINICIP ( Closed Loop Insulin Infusion Critically Ill Patients ) Department take part clinical partner , investigator possibility evaluate several European protocol compare computer algorithm MPC ( Model Predictive Control ) . The comparison possibility keep level blood glucose normoglycemia end positively favors eMPC algorithm compare standard protocol . Therefore investigator decide use adaptative version also project glycemia control . THE HYPOTHESIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS : The investigator hypothesize , postoperative normalization already start hyperglycemia significantly decrease occurrence postoperative complication , absolute perioperative glycemia control , thanks complete blockage negative influence even short term hyperglycemia , even emphasize reduction postoperative complication . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome - prove , whether full block perioperative blood glucose elevation reach low occurrence postoperative organ complication , patient temporary peroperative rise glycemia . The investigator observe number adverse event ( newly develop organ dysfunction ) cause postoperative hospital stay : cardiovascular ( LCO , postoperatively initiated inotropic support intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation , acute myocardial ischemia , moderate severe arrhythmia , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) , respiratory ( acute pneumonia , fluidothorax &gt; 300 ml , reintubation , acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury ) , neurological ( stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , gastrointestinal ( ileus , gastric ulcer , gastrointestinal bleeding , hepatopathy , acute pancreatitis , need parenteral nutrition ) , renal ( acute kidney injury define RIFLE criterion - stage Injury ) infection define clinical picture need systemic antibiotic therapy Scoring system ( Euroscore , TISS 28 , APACHE II , SAPS3 ) Secondary outcome : in-hospital mortality , ICU time development MPC algorithm TIME SCHEDULE : Year 1- starting project , establishment database , recruitment patient ( 800 ) process partial result Year 2- project review , recruitment patient ( 800 ) process partial result presentation Year 3- project review , recruitment patient ( 800 ) , final result process publication , study end METHODS : Type study : prospective , randomize , control , double blind Inclusion criterion : patient undergo cardiac surgery , men woman age 18-90 year , sign informed consent Exclusion criterion : patient 's dissent , allergy insulin component add insulin solution Reasons exclusion study : repeat ( twice ) major hypoglycemia Randomization : admission OR two equally large group ( A , B ) , sign inform consent A = Group intensive glycemia control : blood glucose level maintain continuous insulin infusion ( Actrapid , Novo Nordisk A/S , Bagsvaerd , Danemark - 50 IU/50 ml FR ) accord actual glycemia keep within normoglycemia limit ( 4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l ) since patient 's admission operating room . Samplings take 1 4 hour interval accordance glycemia stability MPC algorithm suggestion . B = Group standard glycemia control : blood glucose level maintain continuous insulin infusion ( see ) within normoglycemia limit ( 4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l ) patient 's admission ICU cardiac surgery . During surgery hyperglycemia interfere reach level 10 mmol/l , i.v . bolus 1-2 IU rapid-acting insulin administer order keep glucose value threshold . Data collection : demographic clinical characteristic , BMI , standard laboratory finding , perioperative organ complication ( respiratory , renal , hematologic , immunologic , infection , wound heal ) , wean ventilatory support , use catecholamine , in-hospital mortality , score ( Euroscore , TISS 28 , APACHE II , SAPS ) CONCLUSION : The answer question optimal time start glycemia control patient advance know begin acute stress reaction would give u chance , hypothesis confirm , block time negative effect hyperglycemia thereby decrease number postoperative organ complication , would significant importance medical , also socio-economical . Also eMPC improvement base clinical data study give intensivists instrument markedly simpler mainly accurate glycemia normalization glycemia control critically ill patient recent glycemia protocol enable .</detailed_description>
