	<brief_title>Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study safety efficacy single agent Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin ( MylotargÂ® ) induction therapy patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) relapse standard treatment candidate standard consolidation treatment Daunorubicin cytosine arabinoside . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate morbidity mortality use gemtuzumab ( gemtuzumab ozogamicin ) specific subtypes leukemia . II . To correlate gemtuzumab response degree cluster differentiation ( CD ) 33 positivity . III . To correlate FMS-Related Tyrosine Kinase 3 ( FLT 3 ) /nucleophosmin ( NPM ) status CD 33 positivity gemtuzumab response . IV . To document incidence sinusoidal obstruction syndrome use gemtuzumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 15 . Treatment continue 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year .</detailed_description>
