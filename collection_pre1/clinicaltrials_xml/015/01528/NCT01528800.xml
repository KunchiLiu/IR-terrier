	<brief_title>Vitamin K Attenuate Coronary Artery Calcification Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At every stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , lead cause mortality cardiovascular disease . This due , part , vascular calcification coronary artery . The extent VC coronary artery patient CKD commonly determine high resolution CT scan . The total coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) score , measure Agatston unit ( AUs ) , reflect calcium burden 3 major coronary artery current standard determine extent vascular calcification hemodialysis patient . Matrix Gla protein ( MGP ) , vitamin K dependent protein , key inhibitor vascular calcification present arterial wall . It establish MGP become up-regulated adjacent site calcification vitamin K critical function . Therefore vitamin K status may critical extent vascular calcification patient group . However , date , trial examine whether vitamin K supplementation prevents progression coronary artery calcification patient kidney failure , group high risk establish . Therefore , primary research question : Does vitamin K supplementation 10 mg phylloquinone thrice weekly reduce progression coronary artery calcification ( measure CAC score ) 12 month incident hemodialysis patient baseline CAC score &gt; = 30 Agatston Units compare placebo ? Secondary question include : 1 ) Does phylloquinone reduce progression calcification thoracic aorta , aortic valve mitral valve ? 2 ) Does phylloquinone decrease major cardiovascular event acute coronary syndrome , congestive heart failure , stroke , transient ischemic attack , amputation revascularization procedure ?</detailed_description>
