	<brief_title>Talactoferrin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Squamous Cell Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Monitoring immunologic response therapy tumor tissue peripheral blood . Identification potential candidate biomarkers indicate clinical benefit talactoferrin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival ( PFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , overall survival ( OS ) , disease stability , disease stability 7 week . OUTLINE : Patients receive talactoferrin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 12 week . Courses repeat every 14 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly least 12 month .</detailed_description>
