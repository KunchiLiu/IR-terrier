	<brief_summary>This multicentre , open , randomise , control trial conduct sixty ( 60 ) patient diagnose refractory recurrent ascites . Patients randomise ( enrol ) either treatment arm A- implant ALFApump System treatment arm B-standard care evacuation large volume paracentesis . The main aim study determine paracentesis free survival , define time first large volume therapeutic paracentesis &gt; 5 litre . The secondary aim ass non-inferiority cirrhosis-related complication group patient randomize ALFApump system group , well nutritional effect , resource utilisation , patient quality life survival non-inferiority .</brief_summary>

Cirrhosis liver define histological and/or clinical , and/or radiological criterion 3 . Presenting refractory recurrent ascites require periodic large volume paracentesis ( large volume define &gt; 5 L accord teh clinical guidance EASL , European Association Study Liver , recommend withdrawal 5 L precipitate administration albumin ) . 4 . Capable give write informed consent , willing comply study procedure ability operate device 1 . Gastrointestinal haemorrhage last 7 day 2 . Renal failure define serum creatinine high equal 2 mg/dl 3 . Severe coagulopathy define prothrombin time great 40 % upper limit Normal ( determine locally ) . 4 .

Clinical evidence recur urinary infection , define 2 episode last 6 month single episode within last 2 week . 7 . Clinical evidence loculated ascites . 8 . Advanced hepatocarcinoma , define one exceed Milan criterion . 9 . Obstructive uropathy , residual urinary volume exceed 100 ml , bladder anomaly might contraindicate implantation device . 10 .
