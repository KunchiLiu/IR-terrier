	<detailed_description>Every year , thousand people Canada either die permanently disabled suffer stroke . This cost society billion dollar physician service , hospital expense , decrease productivity . Some individual slightly lucky ; instead severe stroke , either mild stroke temporary stroke symptom , also know transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , experience loss ability . However , mild stroke TIA 's precede onset serious , disable stroke . Most significant stroke happen mild stroke TIA occur within day original event ; need early intervention could prevent occurrence . One goal recent research find way prevent major stroke individual sustain minor stroke TIA . Up , stroke doctor focus treat elevate blood pressure cholesterol level , scan blood vessel neck significant narrowing , search irregular heart rhythm , treatable condition put patient risk stroke . Despite research show sleep disorder sleep apnea ( abnormal pause breathe sleep ) restless legs syndrome ( cause involuntary leg movement sleep ) possible risk factor stroke , condition routinely investigate stroke doctor TIA stroke . The investigator hypothesize study patient , receive expedite sleep assessment expedite treatment sleep disorder , 3-month follow-up assessment : ( ) Significantly improve quality life 3 month compare baseline measurement ( primary outcome ) ; ( ii ) Improved outcomes measure sleepiness , psychomotor vigilance , daily function , depressive symptom , cognition , blood pressure 3 month ( secondary outcome ) .</detailed_description>
