	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study investigate clinical feasibility effectiveness off-line Positron-Emission-Tomography ( PET ) quality assurance promote accuracy proton carbon ion beam therapy . One main clinical advantage ion therapy conventional radiation therapy excellent conformation deliver dose tumour volume well spar surround healthy tissue . However , clinical exploitation potential maximum extent require in-vivo validation actual treatment delivery , particular , ion beam range within patient . Since primary ion completely stop target volume oppose photon radiation , conventional quality assurance technique like transmission electronic portal imaging apply monitor ion beam therapy . Hence , ion treatment plan currently rely model experimental data accurately validate tissue-equivalent target , direct verification actual treatment delivery ion beam range within patient possible standard clinical practice . At present , PET offer unique possibility monitor precision ion irradiation in-vivo non-invasively . The method base detection b+-activity form by-product irradiation , i.e . without administration radio-tracers patient . A positive clinical impact in-beam ( i.e . irradiation ) PET monitoring demonstrate carbon ion therapy pilot project GSI Darmstadt , Germany , promise clinical data post-radiation PET/CT imaging recently report passive proton beam delivery USA Japan . Therefore , pilot clinical study hereby propose Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center order 1 ) ass applicability post-radiation PET imaging scan ion beam delivery , 2 ) identify patient population may benefit 3 ) extract population-based information reliability beam range different tumour location ion specie clinically available HIT . The investigated patient expect benefit study , since case detect deviation plan actual treatment delivery proper correction could apply next irradiation fraction , assure overall well treatment without monitoring . Moreover , site-specific patient-population information ion range precision HIT might enable improvement CT-range calibration curve well safe reduction treatment margin promote enhance treatment plan conformality full clinical exploitation promise ion beam therapy .</brief_summary>
