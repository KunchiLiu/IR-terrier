	<brief_summary>The present study randomize , control , multicenter phase III study recurrent metastatic ( R/M ) nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) treat Gemcitabine ( Gemzar , Lilly ) cisplatin regimen ( GP ) 5-Fluorouracil plus cisplatin regimen ( FP ) . The population consist recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) fail radical radiotherapy chemotherapy-naïve advance NPC ( stage IV ) . The effectiveness side effect evaluate accord Standard WHO response criterion NCI-CTC AE V3.0 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) commonly see Southeast Asia , especially southern southeastern China , incidence rate document 10 150 case per 100,000 population per year . NPC radiosensitive tumor , radiotherapy consider treatment choice case . The 5-year survival rate ( stage ) around 50 % .In word , half NPC case eventually fail radiotherapy reason failure local relapse remote metastasis . For advanced metastatic NPC , chemotherapy important therapeutic , relatively responsive chemotherapy compare head neck cancer . The backbone treatment recurrent/metastatic ( R/M ) NPC cisplatin contain regimen , also regard standard regimen squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . The FP regimen widely use R/M NPC patient response rate around 40 % -65 % , response period usually short adverse reaction frequent badly tolerant , influent treatment compliance seriously . What 's , catheter pump necessary continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil , add cost , immobility inconvenience treatment . Preclinical clinical data show synergistic activity gemcitabine cisplatin without overlap toxicity . Several clinical trial enrol minority advance NPC patient suggest GP regimen promise effectiveness well tolerated side effect , indicate potential possibility GP regimen come standard first line choice instead FP regimen</detailed_description>
