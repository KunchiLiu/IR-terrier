	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Treatments Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim evaluate efficacy cabazitaxel patient palliative head neck previously treat platinum-based therapy . The study design non comparative randomize phase II trial : ARM 1 : cabazitaxel ( 20 mg/m2 , every 3 week ) versus ARM 2 methotrexate ( 40 mg/m2 , weekly ) . Cabazitaxel dose increase 25mg/m2 second subsequent cycle , absence non-hematological AE &gt; grade 2 hematological AE &gt; grade 3 first cycle . ( maximum 10 cycle ) . The aim randomization offer valid internal control group avoid possible selection bias . However , result obtain two treatment group formally compare objective phase II study . Tumor check-up perform every 9 week . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity accord patient investigator . A maximum 10 cycle cabazitaxel give .</detailed_description>
