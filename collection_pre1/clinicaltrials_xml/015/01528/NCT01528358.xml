	<brief_summary>Hypotheses : 1 . In acute phase early illness , tissue oxygen saturation vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) important adjunct differentiate severe critical illness require ICU admission patient benefit less aggressive therapy ( non-ICU admission ) . 2 . An early feature severe sepsis abnormal microcirculatory vasoreactivity . 3 . Microvascular reactivity measure mean vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) use non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measure tissue Oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) . 4 . Microvascular reactivity significantly derange patient early severe sepsis quantifiably different non-septic critically ill patient . 5 . Other measure microcirculatory perfusion ie . sublingual orthogonal polarization spectral ( OPS ) video microscopy , abnormal directionally correlate VOT StO2 severe sepsis 6 . In severely septic patient response therapy assess VOT StO2 monitoring correlate prognosis . 7 . A management protocol incorporate VOT StO2 monitor addition conventional hemodynamic biochemical parameter guide therapy result improve outcome severely septic patient . This project investigate use non-invasive near infrared light ( NIR ) device conjunction brief arm compression measure microcirculation critically ill patient . It know patient overwhelming infection , blood vessel respond normally NIR device help measure abnormal blood vessel . This type test non-invasive perform repeatedly without harm patient may provide early way determine whether overwhelm sepsis also may help optimize treatment receive good tailor treatment degree blood vessel abnormality find . If hypothesis correct , simple non-invasive test could provide rapid mean assess patient could do safely quickly current method . This would important effect enhance patient safety improve outcome critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Near InfraRed Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Overview : This project focus early diagnosis management septic shock use tissue near infrared spectroscopy ( tNIRS ) continuous non-invasive assessment microcirculatory vasoreactivity diagnostic prognostic indicator critically ill patient . A novel aspect study point entry patient via Critical Care Outreach Team ( CCOT ) ensure patient assess early phase disease prior co-incident admission Critical Care Unit ( CCU ) . The investigator employ tNIRS assess peripheral tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) patient assess CCOT ( n = 1031 patient 2009 ) addition , investigator employ NIRS vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) use brief episode forearm ischemia quantify microvascular ( dy ) function . All patient admit CCU via CCOT ( n = 230 patient 2009 ) StO2 monitor VOT assessment sequentially throughout course critical illness . Biomarkers assess severity illness , inflammatory process microcirculatory reactivity obtain , subset patient ( n = 30 ) , correlation parameter index microvascular perfusion use sublingual orthogonal polarization spectral ( OPS ) image videomicroscopy sought . As estimate 20-30 % CCOT admission sepsis ( n = 40-60 ) , inclusion critically ill non-septic patient enable discrimination various parameter VOT contrast group determine relative diagnostic prognostic significance . Statement Objectives : 1 . To assess diagnostic utility tNIRS StO2 VOT early assessment critically ill patient . 2 . To determine whether significant pathognomonic difference exist StO2 index VOT septic patient versus non-septic critically ill patient healthy age match volunteer . 3 . To determine whether correlation exist biomarkers inflammation vasoreactivity measure StO2 VOT severely septic patient . 4 . To determine whether incorporation StO2 VOT treatment protocol positively impact clinical outcome critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
