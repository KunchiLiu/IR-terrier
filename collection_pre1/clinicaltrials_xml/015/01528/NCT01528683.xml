	<brief_summary>Treatment standard patient rectal cancer depend initial stag include surgical resection , radiotherapy well chemotherapy . For stage II III tumor , radiochemotherapy perform addition surgery , preferentially preoperative radiochemotherapy short-course hypofractionated radiation . Advances surgical approach , especially establishment total mesorectal excision ( TME ) combination sophisticated radiation chemotherapy reduce local recurrence rate percent . However , due high incidence rectal cancer , still high absolute number patient present recurrent rectal carcinoma , effective treatment therefore need . Carbon ion offer physical biological characteristic . Due invert dose profile high local dose deposition within Bragg peak precise dose application spar normal tissue possible . Moreover , comparison photon , carbon ion offer increase relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) , calculate 2 5 depend cell line well endpoint analyze . Japanese data treatment patient recurrent rectal cancer previously treat radiation therapy show local control rate carbon ion treatment superior surgery . Therefore , treatment concept also evaluate recurrence radiotherapy , dose application use conventional photon limit . Moreover , patient likely benefit enhance biological efficacy carbon ion . In current Phase I/II-PANDORA-01-Study recommend dose carbon ion radiotherapy recurrent rectal cancer determine Phase I part , feasibility progression-free survival assess Phase II part study . Within Phase I part , increase dos 12 x 3 Gy E 18 x 3 Gy E apply . The primary endpoint Phase I part toxicity , primary endpoint Phase II part progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
