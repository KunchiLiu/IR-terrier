	<brief_summary>During coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) , saphenous vein leg use bypass atherosclerotic blockage artery heart . Unfortunately , vein bypass develop blockage time , process term saphenous vein graft disease . By lower cholesterol level blood , statin medication use surgery prevent development atherosclerotic blockage vein bypass . Recently , high dos statin medication introduce , study show effective traditional dos use heart attack patient . Furthermore , laboratory test show high dos statin medication slow development atherosclerosis . Despite benefit , little known regard use high-dose statin therapy bypass surgery human . The goal study see high-dose statin therapy prevent development vein graft occlusion first year bypass surgery . Patients randomize receive either high-dose statin therapy conventional moderate-dose statin therapy start within 4 day surgery continue duration one year operation . The statin medication give capsule form . During course study , neither patient health care team know treatment patient receive . One year bypass surgery , compute tomography ( CT ) coronary angiogram perform evaluate patency vein bypass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aggressive Cholesterol Therapy Inhibit Vein Graft Events After CABG ( ACTIVE Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current clinical guideline recommend treatment achieve LDL level &lt; 100 mg/dL surgical coronary revascularization . However , recent study illustrate even intensive lipid reduction high-dose statin improve cardiovascular outcome . Targeting LDL level 70 mg/dL CABG intensive statin therapy may prevent process postoperative saphenous vein graft disease lead improve graft patency . Therefore , ACTIVE Trial , conduct randomize control trial compare high-dose ( 80 mg atorvastatin ) moderate-dose ( 10 mg atorvastatin ) statin therapy patient undergo CABG saphenous vein graft . The effect aggressive cholesterol therapy process vein graft disease examine compute tomography ( CT ) coronary angiography one year CABG . This study address subject postoperative high-dose statin therapy help determine optimal lipid-lowering strategy follow CABG .</detailed_description>
