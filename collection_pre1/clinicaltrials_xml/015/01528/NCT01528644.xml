	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anaemia affect around two billion people worldwide . Food fortification iron realistic way combat problem . Water soluble form iron consider bioavailable nonsoluble iron compound . However , former often cause sensory problem add food , latter cause few problem generally well absorb therefore ineffective fortificants . A potential strategy overcome problem use water soluble iron compound protected water resistant barrier , prevent potential organoleptic change within fortify food protect iron ( oxidation ) digestion process thus increase availability . The investigator use alginate , form alginate bead , protective barrier soluble iron gluconate . It show alginates bind divalent trivalent cation therefore may useful vehicle soluble iron compound fortify food . The aim project measure effect alginate iron absorption ferrous gluconate ass potential modulating effect calcium iron absorption presence absence alginate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron &amp; Alginate Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomise , single blind , cross-over trial participant randomly allocate two group : A ( n= 8 volunteer ) B ( n=8 volunteer ) . The study include total four arm . By administration test meal # 1 ( iron alginate bead ) # 4 ( iron capsule ) possible protective effect alginate iron absorption investigate . By administration test meal # 2 ( iron alginate bead + calcium capsule ) # 3 ( iron capsule + calcium capsule ) study investigate whether alginates bind calcium ( well-known iron inhibitor ) vivo , thus diminish potential negative effect calcium iron absorption . Only half ( 8 ) volunteer undergo treatment include calcium . Therefore group A undergo 4 test , whereas group B undergo 2 4 test . The four test meal administer week apart follow overnight fast . On occasion blood sample take place period 6h sample take via cannula t=0 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 , 300 360 min . Serum sample analyse iron content allow calculation iron absorption . The assumption make power calculation estimate number volunteer difference 2.5 % iron absorption presence absence alginate ( test meal # 1 test meal # 4 ) nutritionally significant . A minimum 12 volunteer would require complete study detect difference 2.5 % significance level 0.05 80 % power . A minimum 8 volunteer would require detect significant difference iron absorption 3.3 % test meal contain 20mg iron iron gluconate calcium test meal contain 20mg iron iron gluconate calcium alginate bead ( test meal # 2 # 3 ) . This assume power 80 % , level significance 0.05 standard deviation difference ( within pair ) 2.8 %</detailed_description>
