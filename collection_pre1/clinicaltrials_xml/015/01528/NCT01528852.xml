	<brief_summary>In community-based controlled trial among child evaluate use 4 % Chlorhexidine cleanse solution umbilical cord infant first 10 day life result - Reduction neonatal mortality ( death first 28 day life ) - Reduction umbilical cord infection ( define moderate severe redness cord ) first 28 day life - Reduction umbilical cord infection ( define pu formation degree redness ) first 28 day life . The double blind part study use control preparation without chlorhexidine ( CHX ) control group sub-study dry cord care group also evaluate second control . Hypothesis CHX group lower mortality umbilical cord infection control group dry cord group similar show previous study Nepal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Goal : The purpose trial evaluate efficacy cord cleanse Chlorhexidine first 10 day life reduce neonatal mortality morbidity . The study would provide proof principle intervention could easily scale . Objectives formative phase : - Using TIPS ( Trials Improved Practices ) methodology evaluate acceptance impediment practice use liquid solution cord clean include wash hand soap use . - To compare 3 mode ( 3 different packaging application use cotton ball , dropper bottle squeeze tube ) delivery cord cleaning term acceptance , ease use effectiveness cover target area . Objectives main Trial : Primary Objectives : In double-blind community-based randomize controlled trial among 24,000 child evaluate efficacy application 4 % Chlorhexidine cleanse solution umbilical cord infant first 10 day life compare infant cleanse similar control solution without Chlorhexidine : - Reduction neonatal mortality ( death first 28 day life ) . - Reduction umbilical cord infection ( define moderate severe redness cord ) first 28 day life . - Reduction umbilical cord infection ( define pu formation degree redness ) first 28 day life . Secondary Objectives : In nested sub-study among 12,000 birth ( 8000 24,000 double blind main study 4000 additional birth ) randomize three group : Chlorhexidine cord care ( n=4000 ) , control solution cord care ( n=4000 ) dry cord care ( n=4000 ) : - To evaluate sensitivity specificity traditionally use `` field definition omphalitis '' base combination sign symptom comparison culture result use state art sample collection/transport , culture bacterial identification . - To evaluate reduction bacterial colonization rate ) umbilical cord tip , b ) stump base area Chlorhexidine Control Solution group compare currently recommend dry cord care .</detailed_description>
