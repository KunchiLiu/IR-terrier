	<brief_summary>Therapy non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) evolution new molecular pathway target therapy identify . Although NHLs respond currently available therapy , majority patient relapse many never complete response therapy . In investigator attempt understand pathogenesis NHLs , investigator identify characterized expression human endogenous retrovirus ( HERVs ) DNA , RNA protein level association presence NHLs ( neoplastic disease ) . The investigator preclinical evidence suggest correlation level HERV-K ( particular family HERVs ) expression NHL disease activity , lead u hypothesize HERV-K expression may contribute development disease and/or recurrence . If hypothesis correct , drug inhibit HERV-K expression may prevent recurrence disease and/or may provide novel therapeutic approach NHLs . To test hypothesis , investigator eventually intend study use anti-retroviral therapy patient NHL . The investigator vitro study demonstrate HERV-K expression decrease response currently FDA-approved available , anti-HIV drug , Lamivudine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( tenofovir ) . These medication tolerate well HIV patient , unknown combination Lamivudine Tenofovir tolerate patient NHL . To test investigator hypothesis , investigator propose follow Specific Aims current study : ( 1 ) To evaluate tolerability , toxicity safety administer Lamivudine Tenofovir combination patient relapse refractory NHL ; ( 2 ) To evaluate effect combination lamivudine tenofovir HERV-K plasma viral RNA load ; ( 3 ) To monitor response rate NHL treatment combination lamivudine tenofovir . The investigator study recruit adult patient relapse refractory NHL investigator identify expression HERV-K. Volunteer participant administer combination lamivudine tenofovir monitor tolerability , toxicity , compliance , change viral RNA load disease response .</brief_summary>
