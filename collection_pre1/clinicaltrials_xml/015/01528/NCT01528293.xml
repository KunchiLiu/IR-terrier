	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , comparative interventional human subject trial . Patients chronic venous ulceration lower extremity enrol study . These wound must recalcitrant standard treatment regimen . There total two arm study . One group randomly assign receive Vacuum Assisted Closure ( V.A.C . VAC ) mean ActiV.A.C . + Compression therapy group consist application device along compression therapy . The group randomly assign compression therapy group . A total 60 subject enrol 6 week study . There 2 week run-in period ( prior onset intervention ) ensure wound heal great 35 % prior intervention randomization . Wounds heal within 6 week trial period additional confirmatory visit 2 week heal identify . If within 6 week intervention period wound bed determine ready Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) , surgery clinic application schedule within 4 week . Subjects deem surgical candidate , Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) application clinic . This include patient medically unstable receive medical clearance surgery otherwise candidate Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) surgery ( e.g . donor site skin compromise ) . During period schedule STSG surgery BAT application , subject continue within assign treatment group . A confirmatory visit also occur 2 week application Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) . Patients diagnose chronic venous ulceration assess study eligibility initial clinical evaluation . Patients meet eligibility requirement ask enroll study ( see Subject Recruitment ) . Subjects ask sign inform consent form receive copy inform consent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose chronic venous ulceration assess study eligibility initial clinical evaluation . Patients meet eligibility requirement ask enroll study ( see Subject Recruitment ) . Subjects ask sign inform consent form receive copy inform consent . The study conduct follow manner : Prescreening , Screening , Enrollment - Obtain informed consent - Assess patient eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion - Initial quality life questionnaire complete - Target ulcer • If 1 wound present either leg ; target ulcer one large overall dimension . All ulcer treat per Standard Care . - Photo/wound measurement - Venous study ( necessary confirm diagnosis ) - Case Record Form ( CRF ) complete - Subjects continue Standard Care treatment initiation visit - If patient currently undergo pump pneumatic compression therapy , must discontinue treatment least 2 week treatment initiation visit Treatment Initiation Visit Randomization - Begin 2 week enrollment visit - Confirm continue eligibility : - Photo/wound measurement ( perform debridement ) - Exclude wound size decrease &gt; 35 % - Randomization 2 treatment group 1 . ActiV.A.C . System Negative Pressure Therapy + Compression Therapy 2 . Compression Therapy - Quality life questionnaire complete - CRF complete Subjects 1 visit clinic 1 visit home nurse change dress Acti V.A.C ( applicable ) weekly Weekly Follow-Up - Visits must ± 2 day schedule appointment - Photo/wound measurement ( perform debridement ) - Change ActiV.A.C . System+ Compression Therapy Compression Therapy - Quality life questionnaire complete week 4 , 6 - CRF complete - If subject heal heal , wind ready Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) 6 week time point , patient exit study ( see Close-Out ) - If subject heal within 6 week interventional phase , wound ready Split Thickness Skin Graft Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) , schedule Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) Close-Out - If subject heal , exit study 6 week time point - Photo/wound measurement ( perform debridement ) - Close-out specific CRF complete - Complete quality life questionnaires - Follow-up treatment plan individual investigator Confirmatory Visit - If target wound heal within 6 week interventional period , subject schedule confirmatory visit 2 week wound deem heal - Photo/wound measurement ( perform debridement ) - Close-out specific CRF complete - Complete quality life questionnaires - Follow-up treatment plan individual investigator Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) - If wound deem ready Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) subject either : - Be schedule surgery application Split Thickness Skin Graft within 4 week - Have Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) apply clinic within 4 week - Subject continue intervention date surgery - After Split Thickness Skin Graft , subject receive Standard Care ( SOC ) utilize ActiV.A.C . ™ + Compression Therapy - After Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) , subject receive Standard Care utilize compression therapy - Photo/Wound Measurements ( perform debridement ) - CRF complete - Subjects f/u visit within 5-7 day dress change per Standard Care Close-Out/Confirmatory Visit Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) *2 week date surgery ( Split Thickness Skin Graft ) clinic application ( Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ) - Regardless target wound heal , subject exit study - Photo/Wound measurement - Percent adherence subject receive Split Thickness Skin Graft - Close-out specific CRF complete - Complete quality life questionnaires - Follow-up treatment plan individual investigator Application Devices/Dressing The usual consent form part Standard Care utilized per Center Wound Healing Georgetown University Hospital . All cost associate clinic visit consistent Standard Care bill customary fashion . Standard Care Wound Therapy ( Debridement , Infection Control ) The surface venous wound wash rinse wound cleanser every visit per Standard Care . The need debridement ( utilizing scalpel and/or curette ) dependent amount nonviable tissue and/or biofilm detect surface wound . The decision debride make individual investigator visit . The use topical enzymatic debriding agent discretion investigator . Further , investigator may use topical antimicrobial need . The use oral antibiotic also discretion individual investigator . No wound heal modality include topically apply treatment allow . ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System The ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System FDA approve device treatment venous ulceration . The ActiV.A.C.® System apply customary manner per manufacturer 's recommendation . Acticoat Flex 7™ apply contact layer wind surface . Acticoat Flex 7™ fenestrated , silver-coated ( anti-microbial ) , knit polyester material routinely use contact layer dress chronic wound . The open cell foam apply top Acticoat Flex 7™ ( cut shape wound ) . The adherent transparent occlusive material apply open cell foam . The tube attach cut small aperture occlusive material . Negative pressure set 125 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) continuous suction . The sponge canister replace 2 time per week . This dressing change take place clinic visiting home nurse . These nurse in-service train proper application negative pressure therapy experience use . Compression Therapy Profore™ multi-layered compression bandage system utilized . This include application contact layer dress use Acticoat Flex 7™ . The compression bandage apply per manufacturer 's recommendation . The dressing change 2 time per week . This dressing change take place clinic visiting home nurse . These nurse in-service train proper application compressive dress experience use . Standard Care Post Split-Thickness Skin Graft Application Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) - The application Split Thickness Skin Graft ( STSG ) Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) follow Standard Care . This Standard Care apply interventional group . Split Thickness Skin Grafts apply operating room debridement venous wound conduct per Standard Of Care . After placement Split Thickness Skin Graft onto wound surface , nonadherent dressing place onto graft follow silver impregnate dress layer . The ActiV.A.C.™ open celled foam place silver impregnated dress customary fashion . Compressive dressing place ActiV.A.C.™ occlusive material . The postoperative dressing remove within 5-7 day . The wound site redress nonadherent dress contact layer , silver impregnated dressing , Profore™ . The application BAT take place outpatient clinic . This include debridement wound application Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue ( BAT ) onto wound surface . The dressing include nonadherent contact layer , follow silver impregnate dressing , finally Profore™ compressive dressing .</detailed_description>
