	<brief_summary>This large pragmatic , randomize control trial compare pre-hospital initiation therapeutic hypothermia Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) providers conventional post-resuscitation care . The goal trial increase proportion cardiac arrest patient appropriately treat in-hospital therapeutic hypothermia reach target body temperature within 6 hour hospital arrival . The investigator believe EMS-initiation cool powerful reminder in-hospital clinician continue therapeutic hypothermia , lead care improvement across health system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This large pragmatic , randomize control trial compare pre-hospital initiation therapeutic hypothermia Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) providers conventional post-resuscitation care . The goal trial increase proportion cardiac arrest patient appropriately treat in-hospital therapeutic hypothermia reach target body temperature within 6 hour hospital arrival . The investigator believe EMS-initiation cool powerful reminder in-hospital clinician continue therapeutic hypothermia , lead care improvement across health system . This study build previous work use large hospital network hospital improve delivery evidence-based practice . The primary research question follow : Does pre-hospital initiation therapeutic hypothermia EMS provider increase proportion comatose hospital cardiac arrest patient return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) successfully cool target temperature 32 34 degree Celsius within 6 hour emergency department arrival , compare usual post-resuscitation care provide field ? The primary outcome proportion include patient successfully cool reach target temperature 32 34 degree Celsius within 6 hour emergency department arrival .</detailed_description>
