	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Pain Relief Patch , shine light limited wavelength painful area back , relieve chronic musculoskeletal back pain . At time , study gather information side effect associate use Pain Relief Patch . The study compare Pain Relief Patch patch similar appearance , shine different , presumed nontherapeutic , wavelength light .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blue Light Device Pain Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test Pain Relief Patch ( PRP ) , new device contain LEDs worn skin painful area , see effective relieve chronic musculoskeletal back pain . It also test safety patch . The LEDs PRP emit certain kind light ( peak wavelength 453 nm ) stimulate production nitric oxide ( NO ) skin . NO show induce number action contribute pain relief , include relaxation smooth muscle cell , dilation blood vessel , increase concentration oxygen cell washout metabolic byproduct toxin cause cell injury death . Participants one treatment group treat 5 time 2 week 30 minute PRP patch clinic . Participants control arm treat length time similar device contains LEDs emit another wavelength light induce production NO . To prevent influence expectation result , neither participant medical staff directly responsible treatment tell test patch participant treat . Other clinic staff responsible activity could identify treatment arm , include put device remove , examine condition participant ' skin treatment . To get accurate measure effective device , participant score pain several time treatment period begin , well treatment . They also complete several pain questionnaire study .</detailed_description>
