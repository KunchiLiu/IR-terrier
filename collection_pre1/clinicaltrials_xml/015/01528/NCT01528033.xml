	<brief_summary>The Institute Research Operative Medicine part Private University Witten /Herdecke Kinetic Concepts Incorporated perform clinical study evaluate efficacy Vacuum Assisted Closure® ( V.A.C.® ) Therapy treatment postsurgical abdominal wound heal impairment surgery . Therefore underlie layer fibrous tissue permeate internal organ must intact . Background study decision german authority , responsible reimbursement medical therapy , ( Joint Federal Committee Germany ) Vacuum assist closure therapy inadmissible standard benefit health insurance company Germany . Basis decision report Institute Quality Economic Efficiency Healthcare System , show insufficient state evidence regard efficacy negative pressure wound therapy treatment acute chronic wound . This study perform several hospital country compare efficacy Vacuum Assisted Closure®-therapy method standard conventional wound therapy accord exist hospital standard . Main outcome measure time need achieve complete stabile wound closure . Furthermore therapy option examine regard several clinical , safety , patient report economic parameter . Patients assign equally chance treatment group . Study participant well attend doctor nurse informed assignment respective treatment arm . The primary outcome measure ( time complete confirm wound closure ) secondary parameter like reappearance wound development wound size time , examine within active study treatment time 42 day , photograph analyse use central computer system . The central analyse personal informed patient detail therapy allocation . Based already perform study experience clinical practise V.A.C.®-therapy suspect faster achieve complete stabile wound closure standard conventional wound therapy use treatment postsurgical abdominal wound heal impairment surgery . Furthermore Vacuum Assisted Closure®-therapy believe effective safe treatment option abdominal wound heal impairment surgery inpatient well outpatient care . belly wound Patients first close belly wound wound heal disorder postoperative course surgery without open underlie layer fibrous tissue eligible include trial diagnosis wound heal impairment postoperative course manifest wound spontaneous dehiscence , wound require active reopen suture treat physician wound close primary intention require treatment achieve permanent closure . Study participant select enrol within clinical surgical department provide respective personal , structural scientific background conduction trial project . Trial therapy start in-hospital may continue ambulatory care . It important examine therapy option also ambulant care set thus study participant good health able continue specific wound treatment ambulant transfer ambulant service soon possible . The result study provide end 2014 make contribution final decision Joint Federal Committee Vacuum Assisted Closure® ( V.A.C.® ) Therapy standard benefit health insurance company Germany inpatient / outpatient care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Study Vacuum Assisted Closure Postsurgical Subcutaneous Abdominal Wound Healing Impairments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Institute Research Operative Medicine part Private University Witten /Herdecke plan perform clinical trial project evaluate efficacy Vacuum Assisted Closure® ( V.A.C.® ) Therapy treatment postsurgical abdominal wound heal impairment surgery without fascial dehiscence . The clinical trial project fully finance Kinetic Concepts Incorporated ( KCI ) . The V.A.C.® Therapy device use study include ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System , InfoV.A.C.® Therapy System , V.A.C . Freedom® Therapy System . All V.A.C.® Therapy device utilize study bear CE mark operate within normal condition use accord manufacturer 's specification . Background clinical trial project decision Joint Federal Committee Germany ( Gemeinsamer Bundesausschusses ( G-BA ) ) Vacuum assist closure therapy inadmissible standard benefit health insurance company Germany . This decision base systematic review &amp; meta-analysis existing trial perform Institute Quality Economic Efficiency Healthcare System ( Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen ( IQWiG ) ) show insufficient state evidence regard efficacy negative pressure wound therapy treatment acute chronic wound . This study project compare Vacuum Assisted Closure® standard conventional wound therapy treatment acute abdominal wound surgery without fascial dehiscence conduct abdominal surgical hospital department require structural , manpower , scientific qualification . Patients stratify accord hospital wound size . Trial therapy start in-hospital may continue ambulatory care . The study design multinational , multicentre , prospective randomize control , adaptive design , clinical superiority trial , blind photographic analysis primary endpoint . The primary objective compare clinical , safety , economic outcome V.A.C.® Therapy SCWT postsurgical abdominal wound heal impairment without fascial dehiscence . The primary outcome observe study time complete abdominal wound closure closure observe day 42 confirm sustained period least 14 consecutive day . This study design also allow detailed description specific covariates determine effect response variable ( heal ) . This study 's hypothesis use V.A.C.® Therapy System , compare SCWT management post-surgical abdominal wound heal impairment intact fascia , result decrease time achieve complete wound closure confirmation subsequent 14 day . Using V.A.C.® Therapy effective safe treatment option hospital well outpatient care treatment subcutaneous abdominal wound wound heal impairment postoperative course . Randomisation treatment arm perform 1:1 ratio . Randomisation perform via centralized system Internet-based tool . To address issue blind , wound photo documentation obtain trial confirmation wound closure assess via blinded photographic analysis , serve method primary endpoint analysis . Primary close abdominal wound wound heal disorder postoperative course surgical intervention without fascial dehiscence eligible include trial diagnosis wound heal impairment postoperative course manifest wound spontaneous dehiscence , wound require active reopen suture treat physician wound close primary intention require treatment achieve permanent closure . During active recruitment phase , pre-trial estimate indicate approximately 600 patient required yield target 552 evaluable participant . Using adaptive design study sample-size calculation re-estimated upon plan interim analysis study data 250 patient . Patients enrol approximately 25 centre Germany , United Kingdom , Belgium Netherlands . The evaluation primary Endpoint define time ( number day ) achieve complete wound closure verify photo documentation blind , computer-based wound quality assessment well wound closure confirmation 14 consecutive day secondary endpoint include clinical endpoint like recurrence , safety endpoint , patient report outcome parameter economic-based outcome measure provide data regard efficacy efficiency NPWT therapy treatment acute post-surgical abdominal wound heal impairment hospital well ambulant setting . The result study provide end 2014 make contribution final decision Joint Federal Committee NPWT standard benefit health insurance company Germany inpatient / outpatient care .</detailed_description>
