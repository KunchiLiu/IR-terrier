	<brief_title>Treatment Fecal Incontinence After Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstetric anal sphincter injury ( OASIS ) common cause fecal incontinence ( FI ) woman . Obstetric-related FI may occur early childbirth . Previous obstetric injury also major cause FI old woman , risk FI increase time childbirth . FI involuntary loss solid liquid stool . Symptoms range fecal urgency , soil , daily passive urge fecal incontinence . FI stigmatize condition . It distress impact restriction quality life , include isolation depression . Tears delivery classify ( Sultan ) first degree tear include vaginal epithelium , second degree tear perineal muscle , third degree involve anal sphincter complex fourth degree include sphincter complex anorectal epithelium . OASIS include third fourth degree tear . First line therapy FI conservative treatment include drug therapy `` biofeedback '' . If conservative treatment fails , surgery may option . Traditionally elective secondary sphincter repair perform least . Sphincter repair may improve symptom short time , efficacy deteriorates time . Other minimal invasive surgical alternative include sacral nerve modulation ( SNM ) anal bulking injection . Sacral nerve modulation involve stimulate sacral nerve , usually S3 S4 . Step one trial period temporary stimulation ( PNE test ) . If test successful , patient implantable stimulator ( step 2 ) modulate sacral nerve function . SNM also beneficial treat FI OASIS , SNM alternative secondary sphincter repair . SNM possibly prefer second line treatment also sphincter tear related FI . Transanal submucosal bulk injection collagen also possible treatment option effective treatment anal fecal incontinence . The purpose study compare efficacy sacral nerve modulation anal bulking injection woman fecal incontinence OASIS Scandinavian multicenter single-blinded , randomize control trial . To answer research question , include 66-86 woman FI OASIS . Sphincter defect classify use three dimensional endoanal ultrasonography . Pelvic floor function include FI register use validated questionnaire . All woman eligible inclusion PNE-tested three week . The purpose cohort analysis , examine possible effect SNM woman sphincter defect , hypothesis relation sphincter defect classify use tree dimensional ultrasound efficacy SNM . Women 50 % symptom reduction PNE test ( positive PNE test ) , randomize allocate 1:1 one two arm 28 participant . One group allocate implantation permanent impulse generator , Interstim II-3058 group allocate anal sub mucosal bulk injection collagen , Permacol . The purpose study compare efficacy SNM anal bulking injection . The hypothesis SNM provide mean change improvement St Marks Incontinence score 4 compare anal bulking group . This study design multicenter single-blinded , randomize control trial . Women less 50 % symptom reduction ( 15-28 , negative PNE test ) , treated third arm anal bulking injection . The purpose cohort study , examine efficacy anal bulking injection woman suffer FI sphincter tear , exclude treatment SNM .</detailed_description>
