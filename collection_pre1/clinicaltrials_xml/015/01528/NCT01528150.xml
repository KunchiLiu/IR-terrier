	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Tendril MRI™ Leads Standard Bradycardia Pacing Indication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diagnostic method view high quality two three dimensional image body . However , magnetic resonance image system generate three electromagnetic field use produce image . These include static magnetic field , time vary gradient magnetic field , radiofrequency field . All three field interact implanted device could create hazard device , patient , . Due issue , currently market pacemaker system may contraindicate use MRI environment . St. Jude Medical develop system , Accent MRI™ system , comprise Accent MRI™ device Tendril MRI™ lead , investigational MRI Activator™ , design mitigate interaction .</detailed_description>
