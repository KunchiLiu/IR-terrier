	<brief_summary>This open-label , phase II trial evaluate antitumor activity safety oral Histone Deacetylase ( HDAC ) -Inhibitor LBH589 . The treatment consist 20 mg LBH589 three time week patient chemo-refractory HDAC overexpressing . metastatic adenocarcinoma stomach , esophagogastric junction lower esophagus ( Barrett carcinoma ) . One cycle last 21 day . A total 28 patient enrolled trial . In patient experience LBH589-related toxicity require treatment rest dose reduction dose may reduce . Subsequent dose adjustment permit base outcome . Treatment continue disease progression intolerable adverse event . Subsequently , patient followed-up one year .</brief_summary>
