	<brief_title>Effect Tai Chi Osteoarthritic Knee Pain Elders With Mild Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 33 % elder 40 % elder age 70 experience knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , lead cause pain disability . Further , 15.3 % elder age 65 CI , prevalence cognitive impairment ( CI ) double every 5 year age 65 . The prevalence OA elder CI comparable elder without CI . Cognitive impairment limit elder ' ability perform daily activity , functional capacity decline rapidly elder without CI . Having knee OA pain addition CI limit elder ' activity . Without proper treatment knee OA pain , elder CI may avoid basic daily activity , rise , walk , stand , climb stair aggravate pain . By avoid basic activity , gradually lose muscle strength , range motion , mobility , lead physical deconditioning social isolation . With age baby boomer advance health care , number elder CI OA increase fourfold 2050 . Alleviating knee pain elder CI knee OA could preserve functioning , perhaps delay institutionalization , save healthcare dollar . Since pharmacological intervention produce serious side effect inadequately reduce pain , especially elder CI , adjuncts Tai Chi ( TC ) need . A low-impact aerobic exercise , TC involve slowly stretching limb trunk ultimately re-establishes normal mechanic knee joint , reduces knee OA pain . The United States Arthritis Foundation American Geriatrics Society endorse TC reduce knee OA pain ; study investigate effect TC knee OA pain elder CI . The primary aim study : 1 . To test efficacy modify TC program reduce knee OA pain community-dwelling elder mild CI . 2 . To test efficacy modify TC program improve physical function quadriceps strength . 3 . To investigate feasibility compliance issue conduct TC . 4 . To estimate clinical significance TC pain reduction community dwell elder mild CI . The result study help u design full-scale RCT precise estimate sample size dosage TC need reduce knee OA pain community-dwelling elder mild CI .</detailed_description>
