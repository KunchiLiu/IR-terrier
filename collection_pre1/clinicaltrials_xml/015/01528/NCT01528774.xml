	<detailed_description>A strong correlation establish CTC progression breast , colon prostate cancer . The number CTC appear act prognostic marker relapse survival number epithelial cancer . Unfortunately , current CTC assay effective reliably detect circulate melanoma cell assay procedure damage cell prohibit study . This study design evaluate sensitivity specificity TrueCells assay , novel approach isolate preserve cell research . Primary Objectives : - Evaluate feasibility reproducibility isolation CTC use TrueCells technology . - Optimize quantitative CTC recovery - Provide preliminary data concern correlation measurement method CTC recovery immunofluorescence , lipid-based staining . Secondary Objectives : - Explore correlation immunofluorescent CTC assay TrueCells CTC culture response treatment objective immune response criterion , progression free survival , 1 2-year survival landmark , overall survival cancer patient . - Attempt isolate long-term tumor cell line evaluation somatic gene mutation , gene protein expression pattern relate individual tumor ( intend identify familial inherited mutation ) , test drug biologic sensitivity . - Isolate plasma RNA DNA assess expression tumor-specific marker ( e.g. , tyrosinase , B-FRAF , V600E , etc . ) metastasis-associated gene ( e.g. , MSH-1 , thymidylate synthase , etc. ) . - Perform ongoing developmental testing continue develop optimize novel technical approach facilitate isolation intact CTC . Methods : Blood sample collect patient melanoma ( 200 ) , prostate cancer ( 200 ) , solid tumor cancer ( 400 ) , benign hematologic condition ( 100 ) , healthy volunteer ( 100 ) . Sequential sample obtain select patient disease progression treatment response allow exploration potential correlation CTC response treatment , progression-free survival overall survival . Samples immediately de-identified assigned numerical code , date sent TrueCells , LLC . Once donate , sample ownership pass TrueCells , LLC . Research study include : - CTC independently count use immunofluorescent stain thick smear prepared entire buffy coat two tube blood ( tube 1 &amp; 2 ) , stain appropriate primary pan-tumor monoclonal antibody lipid marker confirmatory secondary antibody exclude inadvertent inclusion leukocyte endothelial subset verify recognition patient 's cancer . - Leukocytes ( contain CTC ) isolate density gradient centrifugation . The buffy coat plat TrueCells proprietary cell culture medium tumor cell grow propagate ( tube 3 &amp; 4 ) . Cell colony enumerate compare number colony identify immunofluorescent staining . - In case CTC may able grow long-term cell line . These cell may subject analysis evaluation somatic gene mutation well gene protein expression pattern identify characteristic individual tumor well drug biologic agent sensitivity . There may additional future vitro experimental application de-identified early-passage cell line yet identify anticipated application . - Plasma ( byproduct leukocyte isolation process tube 3 &amp; 4 ) collect temporarily frozen DNA RNA isolation molecular assay melanoma molecular marker metastatic gene expression . These sample consume assay procedure . Clinical information abstract medical record de-identified store password-protected spreadsheet . Information collect include age , gender , T , N , M status , health condition , serum LDH , specific tumor marker ( e.g . PSA ) , circulate tumor cell ( analyzed commercial assay ) , somatic genetic mutation present cancer ( e.g . B-RAF V600E melanoma patient ) mitotic rate tumor , date tumor diagnosis , treatment history , date regional metastatic progression date death ( applicable ) .</detailed_description>
