	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Treatment Method Pain Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia ( FIM ) chronic pain condition high prevalence . Studies involve neuroimaging technique identify functional difference cerebral pain processing patient FIM , compare healthy control . This may support FIM functional CNS component . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive safe method inducing change cortical excitability . Previous study show anodal stimulation M1 may change pain perception , possibly modulate functional anomaly FIM brain . The present study two main goal : 1 . To investigate tDCS may provide FIM patient symptom relief due reduction pain . 2 . To investigate tDCS induce functional change brain use fMRI .</detailed_description>
