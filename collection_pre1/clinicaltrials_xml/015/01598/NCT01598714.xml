	<brief_title>Comparison Patient Satisfaction Between 3 Types Dressing Shoes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology : This randomise trial three arm : 1 . Darco , 2 . Podalux , 3 . Standard dress shoe . Design : A randomised control trial ensure shoe distribute without surgeon bias , perform prior surgery principle investigator . Baseline difference assess administration pre-operative MOXFQ score prior randomisation . Primary outcome measure difference score group post-operatively , however also analyse absolute change score group , although feel primary outcome measure major reason change MOXFQ pre post operation surgery . Blinding randomisation : Randomisation achieve computer generate randomisation table . As two main type surgery use study outline ( namely 1st metatarsal osteotomy 1st MTP joint fusion ) , two separate randomisation group ensure number operation evenly distribute three type shoe . This improve heterogeneity group . We decide use two type surgery research question relevant perform secondary analysis look group closely detailed . For practical purpose blind trial surgeon patient aware shoe provide . Analysis : We seek opinion statistician . The data MOXFQ ( primary outcome measure ) subdivide 3 domain , walking/standing , pain social demain , raw score treat laid original paper Dawson et al . ( 2011 ) [ 2 ] . The score 3 domain convert metric 0-100 scale analysis . The Surgical Show Questionnaire score ( secondary outcome measure ) total give score 50 . The data analyse normality , comparison make use ANOVA Kruskall-Wallis test unpaired continuous data advise statistician , significance level set P &lt; 0.05 . We advise perform secondary analysis use linear regression look effect difference within group outcome , example difference operation type shoe . Statsdirect statistical software use . There question ( Q1 ) Surgical Shoe Questionnaire ask patient long wore shoe . This question include scoring include assess patient use , use secondary outcome measure . The study necessarily require strict patient compliance discontinuation shoe valuable information right . This look within secondary analysis use linear regression well . The primary analysis intention treat analysis . Outcome Measures : The MOXFQ widely validate foot score use assessment foot 3 specified domain ; walking/standing , pain , social interaction ( Appendix 1 ) . The MOXFQ ( Manchester-Oxford foot Questionnaire ) walking/standing domain use primary outcome measure include question relevant ease shoe use . However 2 domain analyse although likely confound factor affect . Secondary outcome measure include 11 question related wear shoe form separate questionnaire . ( Appendix 2 ) . Setting : The setting study clinical . Out-patients clinic recruitment follow-up theatre randomisation post-surgical shoe provision . Participants : Patients recruit outpatient clinic directly clinical care team , recruit list forefoot surgery . Patients undergo forefoot surgery meet inclusion criterion invite participate trial provide write information within clinic set [ see Patient Information Sheet ver 1.0 ] . Those wish participate ask provide write consent day surgery [ see Patient Consent Form ver 1.0 ] undertaken principle investigator . Inclusion exclusion criterion choose include majority patient undergo straightforward forefoot surgery would normally manage current post-operative shoe ( Darco ) , capacity consent surgery . Inclusions : Patients 18 year age Patients normally independently mobile Patients significant co-morbidities would expect affect normal ambulation Patients undergo straightforward 1st ray surgery eg . 1st MTPJ arthrodesis , 1st metatarsal osteotomy , ( combination 2nd ray procedure allow ) Patients able understand complete questionnaire Exclusions : Patients 18 year age Patients independently mobile Patients significant co-morbidities effect normal ambulation ( eg hip arthritis ) Patients undergo complicate forefoot reconstructive surgery surgery ray 1st 2nd . Patients unable understand complete self-administered questionnaire Sampling : Sample size determine base power calculation use MOXFQ ( Manchester-Oxford foot Questionnaire ) primary outcome measure . The MOXFQ widely validate foot score use assessment foot 3 specified domain ; walking/standing , pain , social interaction ( Appendix 1 ) . It walking/standing domain provide u data power calculation ( 1,2 ) . The walking/standing domain score 35 transform score 100 , approximate multiple 3 . We calculate standardise difference 15 100 , equate raw score 30 35 , one point drop 5 7 question , minimum difference wish detect . Using significance level 0.05 power level 0.8 calculate arm trial consist 29 patient ( standardise difference mean =15 , standard deviation =20 ) . This agree statistician . In total 90 patient require . We estimate approximately 6 8 procedure carry Foot ankle unit per week , therefore estimate study take around 12 16 week complete . Subject with-drawl : Subjects free with-draw time study , include intention treat analysis assign questionnaire score identical low score participant randomisation group . For example Darco group score 65 95 MOXFQ , subject withdraws assign value 65 . Due short nature study anticipate infrequent . Those patient change surgical footwear include intention treat analysis original randomise group agree statistician . Intervention : Once patient consent complete pre-operative MOXFQ score , follow surgery , patient randomly assign one three treatment arm wear shoe 6 week follow surgery . The participant advise withdrawal study stage possible data collect point use , although due timeframe nature study believe unlikely occur . Patients attend routine follow-up 2 week post-surgery wound review removal suture use nurse-led dressing clinic . Patients attend routine 6 week post-surgery follow-up appointment consultant ask complete questionnaire assessment . This mark end study . Safety assessment : Whilst anticipate adverse event , problem shoe monitor clinic visit document study . Quality control : The study overseen principle investigator . All questionnaire look soon complete clinic , ensure completeness . Project management The study straightforward , minimum man-power requirement , therefore conducted principle co-investigators . Progress monitor regular meeting foot ankle research group hold every 2 month . Data hold within secure office foot ankle fellow , store anonymously use participant number assign consent . The master patient log participant detail hold paper copy within foot ankle office . Expertise As study involve administration simple questionnaire , specialist involvement require . Ethical Issues The patient information leaflet provide patient list surgery clinic allow time consider participate trial . Patients happy participate trial consent day surgery lead co-investigators . Patients allocate particpant number hold master log locked office , throughout trial questionnaire use number maintain confidentiality per Caldicott guideline . Costing Schedule No additional cost incur . The Darco standard dress shoe already use hospital , Podalux shoe provide free trial basis Donjoy Int . Basic cost photocopy questionnaire provide foot ankle research unit . Funding arrangements The additional funding anticipate provision questionnaire estimate around Â£36.00 ( base price photocopy 5p per sheet ) . This include 90 consent form ( 1 page ) , 90 ( 4 page ) , 180 MOXFQ 's ( 1 page ) , 90 Surgical shoe questionnaire ( 1page ) . We anticipate role research nurse negligible questionnaire paperwork administed out-patients clinic prior surgery clinician .</detailed_description>
