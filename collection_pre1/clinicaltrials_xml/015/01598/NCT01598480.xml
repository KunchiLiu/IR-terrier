	<brief_summary>Background : Bio-medical Carbon Technology ( BCT ) Antimicrobial Dressing , novel advance wound dress invented Bio-medical Carbon Technology Co. , Ltd. , Taiwan , consist principally activate carbon fiber impregnate silver particle . The highly porous nature large specific surface area activate carbon fiber provide tremendous adsorptive capacity toxin , wound degradation product , odor . Furthermore , far infrared ray emit activated carbon fiber accelerate blood circulation stimulate tissue regeneration . Silver ion efficiently eliminate broad spectrum bacteria penetrate cell wall bacteria denature essential protein . This clinical trial investigates wound heal effect BCT Antimicrobial Dressing superficial dermal burn patient . Aim : To investigate wound heal effect BCT Antimicrobial Dressing superficial dermal burn . Methods : This trial expect recruit 30 eligible subject . After hospitalized patient diagnose superficial dermal burn , procedure Informed Consent conduct project investigator . As long patient agree join clinical trial sign Informed Consent , two separate area 25 cm2 anatomic site choose distribute control research group respectively coin flip . The wound research group first cleanse normal saline apply BCT Antimicrobial Dressing cover sterile gauze , dressing change every 3 day ( count day apply BCT dressing : Day0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15……etc . ) wound heal . Flamazine apply wound control group instead cover sterile gauze , frequency dress change daily wound recover . The healed non-healed area wound record photograph every 3 day , wound color infection also evaluate . On Day 12 Day 21 , compare ratio heal non-healed area control research group , end point set 21st day . Statistics Analysis : Paired Student 's t-test perform analyze clinical data compare difference healing percentage , heal rate , infection rate , frequency dress change . It statistically significant P &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>
