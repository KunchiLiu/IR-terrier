	<brief_summary>This study explore alter heparin responsiveness ( AHR ) cardiac surgical patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) require systemic anticoagulation heparin . The investigator evaluate hypothesis AHR may directly relate , modulate mediate interaction heparin , antithrombin ( AT ) , heparin-AT complex , one acute phase protein . The investigator particularly interested identifying patient `` true heparin resistance '' , , patient demonstrate AHR even antithrombin-replenishment presence adequate systemic dose heparin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study use prospective , randomize , open-label cross-over design evaluate response recombinant human AT ( rhAT ) and/or supplemental heparin restoration heparin-responsiveness presence biomarkers acute inflammation , call acute phase reactant . Our ultimate goal , course , apply knowledge optimize perioperative management anticoagulation patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass . We first identify enrolled patient alter heparin responsiveness ( AHR ) define ACT &lt; 450 second ( MGH standard target ACT initial dose heparin CPB ) . Patients achieve ACT &gt; 450 sec enter randomization phase study , participation study complete routine clinical care continue unaltered . Those AHR ( post-heparin ACT &lt; 450 sec ) randomize receive either supplemental heparin supplemental AT . Those fail achieve adequate ACT first supplementation cross-over receive alternate supplement . Blood sample ( total 20 ml ) take step measure heparin level , AT level , AT activity . Once patient place onto cardiopulmonary bypass participation study complete . By design , study replicates routine clinical management heparin anticoagulation cardiopulmonary bypass MGH . Most patient ( 80 % ) come cardiac surgery undergo CPB respond adequately routine initial bolus dose heparin ( ACT &gt; 450 350 U/kg ) ; note , subject study achieve target ACT manage accord routine clinical practice without test intervention . Under routine care , patient inadequate initial response heparin receive either supplemental heparin ( 150 U/kg ) pool human antithrombin ( 1000 Units ) , . In study , subject inadequate heparin response ( ACT &lt; 450 ) initial heparin bolus , randomly assign two comparison group ; half receive supplemental heparin ( 150 U/kg ) half receive AT ( 1000 IU ) . Subjects fail respond assign first intervention cross-over receive alternate intervention . Some subject may achieve target ACT despite receive supplemental heparin AT comprise group patient `` true heparin resistance '' whose coagulation profile characterize well understand mechanism resistance . These subject consider complete study even though yet cardiopulmonary bypass manage accord best clinical judgment physician . They may receive additional heparin , additional AT , fresh-frozen plasma , combination . These patient may risk thrombotic complication post-operative period . Accordingly , clinically appropriate , individual may refer evaluation coagulation status , evaluation do part study . This pathophysiological risk-factor association study seek good understand phenomenon alter heparin responsiveness . Accordingly , specific study endpoint apart achieve ACT &gt; 450 sec . In enrolled subject measure level three acute phase reactant , Factor VIII , fibrinogen CRP , heparin level ( anti Xa ) , AT level ( immunofixation ) AT activity initial heparin dose . For subject achieve ACT &gt; 450 also measure additional heparin level ( anti Xa ) , AT level ( immunofixation ) , AT activity intervention randomization/crossover phase . The total amount blood take research-specific laboratory test le 20 ml .</detailed_description>
