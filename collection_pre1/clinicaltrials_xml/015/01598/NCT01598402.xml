	<brief_summary>Patients locally advanced head neck cancer treat chemo-radiotherapy ( shortly treatment ) high risk develop pneumonia aspiration . This pneumonia often associate hospital admission affect quality life . The purpose study , determine whether prophylactic antibiotic may decrease development pneumonia . Prophylactic antibiotic mean sign pneumonia already</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Prophylactic Treatment With Antibiotics During Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy Patients With Head Neck Cancer Prevent Aspiration Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concomitant chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) use locally advanced head neck cancer ( LAHNC ) . It administer patient unresectable disease organ preservation primary treatment . Furthermore , use postoperative treatment case high risk recurrent disease present . This treatment induce high rate acute toxicity , mucositis , dermatitis , dysphagia , anorexia , pain . Swallowing dysfunction aspiration see high proportion ( 30 % -100 % ) patient immense impact Quality life ( QoL ) . Around half patient develop aspiration pneumonia shortly treatment . Patients , develop fever concomitant chemoradiotherapy , time admitted hospital . In differential diagnosis pneumonia first place patient . The standard diagnostic procedure consist chest X-ray culture sputum blood . Pneumonia lead mortality frail patient group . The treatment patient treat chemoradiotherapy develop fever definite suspect pneumonia , administration antibiotic , frequently intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid . LAHNC patient smoke and/or malnutrition high risk get pneumonia radiotherapy . Because smoke one risk factor develop head neck cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) frequently present group . Also , COPD know risk factor develop pneumonia . Aspiration see primary site head neck cancer , sometimes see frequently patient cancer larynx hypopharynx . No data prophylactic administration antibiotic available LAHNC patient . However , Cochrane review publish assess effect prophylactic antibiotic regimen prevention respiratory tract infection ( RTIs ) overall mortality adult receive intensive care .</detailed_description>
