	<brief_summary>It investigators intention investigate whether specially design vaccine , base genetically modify strain bacterium Listeria monocytogenes call ADXS11-001 safe use able boost immune system patient present Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) associate oropharyngeal cancer ( OPSCC ) . It hop vaccine boost immune system immune cell cell kill property able attack cancer cell remain patient treat . However , vaccine novel investigator sure whether able answer question large group patient need make sure vaccine safe use effect immune system patient intend ultimate use . In previous study , patient incurable cervix cancer cause virus , vaccinate ADXS11-001 . Although patient vaccinate experienced flu-like symptom , patient tolerate vaccine well patient suffer long term adverse effect vaccination . However , patient cancer type different early study , investigator need test whether ADXS11-001 also safe patient HPV associate OPSCC . That say , early study guide dose schedule current study patient enter REALISTIC trial receive low dos administer patient earlier cervix cancer study . It hop , patient experience few side effect vaccination without reduce chance stimulate immune system .</brief_summary>
