	<brief_summary>The purpose study verify whether difference exist cyclosporine level sample collect peripheral venous access , catheter line use infuse drug line use infusion immediately interrupt drug infusion five minute interruption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclosporine ( CSA ) Level Blood Samples Collected From Different Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclosporine immunosuppressant prevents graft-versus-host disease , narrow therapeutic window , cause nephrotoxicity . For cyclosporine infusion , tunneled central venous access device use ; however due lipophilic property drug , adsorb catheter surface falsely raise cyclosporine concentration blood specimen . Some author recommend sample collection peripheral access . Others , however , show collected catheter line use infuse drug . Controversies still exist , though , regard best time blood volume discard collect sample . The hypothesis adopt drug adsorption occur line use infusion . Therefore , statistical clinical difference blood sample collect peripheral venous access line use cyclosporine infusion . Additionally , difference becomes small wait five minute interruption infusion drug collection blood sample .</detailed_description>
