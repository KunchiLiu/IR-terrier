	<brief_title>Intervention With Lupin Protein-enriched Foods Hypercholesterolemic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study base previous find daily dosage 25 g lupin protein isolate , administer protein drink , capable influence plasma lipid positively . Consequently , physiological effect mixed diet contain 25 g lupin protein isolate per day investigate compare 1 ) diet contain 25 g milk protein well 2 ) diet 25 g milk protein additionally amino acid arginine supplement daily . A double-blinded , control , randomize cross-over trial perform . Altogether 75 volunteer hypercholesterolemia divide three group 25 subject . After run-in period ( baseline ) , first group consume food lupin protein isolate ( group A ) , second group receive food milk protein isolate ( group B ) third group consume food milk protein 1,6 g arginine per day period four week . After wash-out period six week , diet cross within three group second intervention period four week . After another wash-out period , diet cross within three group . Arginine provide capsule ( 1,6 g per day = four capsule per day ) one two group receive food milk protein . In group ( receive food lupin protein milk protein ) four placebo capsule serve , contain mannitol .</detailed_description>
