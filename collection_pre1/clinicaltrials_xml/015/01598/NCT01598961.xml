	<brief_summary>There report monitor LSR MVD surgery help predict clinical outcome MVD.However , evidence degree partial neuromuscular blockade perform neuromuscular blockade could perform LSR monitoring . Therefore , perform randomize control trial evaluate effect different degree partial neuromuscular blockade , include neuromuscular blockade LSR monitoring MVD surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Target Adequate Partial Neuromuscular Blockade Electrophysiologic Monitoring During Microvascular Decompression Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemifacial spasm develop vascular compression facial nerve root exit zone brain stem . Microvascular decompression ( MVD ) know curative treatment . Lateral spread response ( LSR ) kind pathologic electromyographic ( EMG ) wave form develop facial nerve compress vessel . There report monitoring LSR MVD surgery help predict clinical outcome MVD . As neuromuscular blockade LSR monitoring decrease amplitude EMG , partial neuromuscular blockade usually maintain general anesthesia MVD . However , evidence degree partial neuromuscular blockade perform neuromuscular blockade could perform LSR monitoring . Therefore , perform randomize control trial evaluate effect different degree partial neuromuscular blockade , include neuromuscular blockade LSR monitoring MVD surgery .</detailed_description>
