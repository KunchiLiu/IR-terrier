	<brief_title>Error Based Learning Restoring Gait Symmetry Post-Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walking stroke characterize reduced gait speed presence interlimb spatiotemporal asymmetry . These step length stance time asymmetry energy inefficient , challenge balance control , increase risk fall injury , limit functional mobility . Current rehabilitation improve gait base one two compete motor learn strategy : minimize augment symmetry error train . Conventional rehabilitation often involve walk treadmill therapist attempt minimize symmetry error train . Although approach successfully improve gait speed , produce long-term change symmetry . Conversely , augment amplify symmetry error produce walk split belt treadmill belt set different fixed speed . While approach produce 'after-effect ' result step length symmetry short period time , evidence long term learn people stroke , influence stance time asymmetry . The investigator propose patient need real-time proprioceptive feedback symmetry error actively engage learning process . For project , investigator develop validate novel , responsive , 'closed loop ' control system , use split-belt instrumented treadmill continuously adjust difference belt speed proportional patient 's current asymmetry . Using system , investigator either augment minimize asymmetry step-by-step basis determine motor learn strategy produce large improvement overground spatiotemporal symmetry .</detailed_description>
