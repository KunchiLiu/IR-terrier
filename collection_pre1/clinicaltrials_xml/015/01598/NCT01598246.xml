	<detailed_description>Description project- This prospective chart review identify factor influence successful extubation event . Hypothesis- Successful extubation pediatric intensive care unit dependent variable , identify chance success predict . A clinical practice base upon prediction model , improve quality care provide patient . Type- Prospective chart review . Procedure- Over 1 year period , plan extubations intensive care unit record designate form standard variable chart . All extubation decision make cover attend physician time , study protocol affect/influence alter standard patient care . All data collect retrospectively extubation event . All include patient assign unique identification number ( UID ) investigator , secure patient identifier encrypt electronic file . Extubation failure define reintubation within 72 hour plan extubation classify early ( &lt; 12 hour ) late ( 12-72 hour ) extubation failure . The cause extubation failure record ( identify attend physician service , involve study ) . Data collection statistical analysis- The data collect standard form . The data collect periodically log electronic data base analyze . Investigators perform interim analysis end 6 month final analysis data end 1 year period . Since observational study , extubations time period , include . Based 2010 data collect , monitor unplanned extubations ( 300 extubations ) consider recent expansion unit , investigator expect 500 extubations time period . For statistical analysis , group fail extubation , compare , group extubation success . Standard demographic ( age , sex ) , patient disease relate factor ( diagnosis , duration intubation , secretion , sedation level ) , care factor ( CPAP trial , cuff leak test , use pre-extubation decadron , p/f ratio prior extubation ) , post extubation care ( post extubation respiratory support , stridor , blood gas ) along complication extubation reintubation reason reintubation collect compare . As two group compare , bivariate analysis utilize Chi-square test univariate logistic regression categorical variable Student -tests interval variable , do . Based 9.9 % extubation failure rate 2010 , investigator expect ~50 extubation failure time frame . From preliminary data , investigator also expect 40 % difference primary variable comparison ( age , secretion , sedation level ) . For statistical analysis 95 % confidence interval 80 % power , investigator able detect difference group proportion approximately 20 % expect sample size difference 25 % 99 % CI . The investigator also conduct multivariate logistic regression analysis use extubation failure dependent variable calculate independent odds ratio significant predictor variable . Early Vs late extubation failure , also compare . From literature , investigator assume 80 % extubation failure early ( estimate , 40 early extubation failure 10 late extubation failure , 1 year period ) . They expect statistically significant result number present trial period , however expect get trend plan study .</detailed_description>
