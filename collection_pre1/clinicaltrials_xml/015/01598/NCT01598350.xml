	<brief_summary>On average , Down syndrome ( DS ) occur every 700 live birth result life-long disability increase risk comorbidities.1 Individuals DS also susceptible secondary physical impairment limitation result complication associate joint hypermobility , hypotonicity , increase ligamentous laxity . Secondary impairment pe planus ( flat foot ) , weaken muscle , bony abnormality arthritis may lead painful joint foot . Additionally , child DS often manifest deviation gait result physical limitation impose orthopedic muscular deficiency may lead decreased postural stability . These secondary loss function , exacerbate disability , may preventable use appropriate early intervention aim correct abnormal joint alignment . Research explore effective physical therapy intervention adult child DS currently limit . However , use orthotic device support lax ligament hypotonic muscle , common manifestation DS , one accept method intervention child within population . Orthoses variable structure degree support provide foot ankle also differ foot orthoses ( FOs ) supramalleolar orthoses ( SMOs ) . Previous study support effectiveness orthoses improve ankle foot alignment , well gait parameter . However , disagreement currently exist concern type orthotic device beneficial population child DS . Children DS express variable degree joint laxity hypotonicity , well difference severity specific alignment abnormality excessive pronation calcaneal eversion.6 Current literature insufficient explain difference benefit provide FOs SMOs specific indication use child DS unclear . Study Aims This study demonstrate difference structural outcome provide FOs SMOs develop specific criterion matching individual differ orthopedic impairment beneficial orthotic device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study demonstrate difference functional outcome provide supramalleolar orthoses foot orthoses , well develop specific criterion matching individual Down syndrome ( DS ) differ orthopedic impairment beneficial orthotic device . Participants must able walk independently assistive device , walker , 50 foot one time , least six month walk experience . Participants must also able follow simple verbal instruction . Both male female include study , child race may participate long meet inclusion criterion three ten year age time data collection . Exclusion criterion include history uncorrected visual inner ear impairment , low extremity orthopedic surgical correction . There cost associate participation study , subject pay participation . Participants study fit appropriate size orthoses either physical therapist participant ' school district , one researcher prior data collection . The correct fitting orthotic size use size guide provide Cascade . These footplates various size provide length child 's foot inch orthosis width fit child . Measurements height , weight , leg length , medial longitudinal arch height , tibial torsion , calcaneal eversion take subject . Weight measure kilogram use scale , height , leg length , medial longitudinal arch height measure use metric tape measure . Tibial torsion measure participant lie prone ( stomach ) plinth one knee flex 90 degree . The angle tibial torsion form line perpendicular line medial lateral malleoli ankle , line parallel femur . This angle measure use goniometer , instrument use measure joint angle range motion , angle measure side . Finally , stand , calcaneal eversion measure determine angle neutral calcaneal alignment rest stance . Neutral calcaneal alignment find palpate position talus , talus bone felt equally side foot . Once neutral alignment determine line drawn washable marker posterior talus midline calf . The participant ask stand normal position goniometer use measure angle neutral alignment rest alignment ankle . In addition measurement , hypermobility screen perform mobility finger , wrist , elbow , knee , spine score . The screen score use point system one point give ability perform task screen . These task include ability actively extend little finger 90 degree metacarpophalangeal joint , passively touch thumb volar surface forearm , extend wrists 90 degree , extend elbow knee 10 degree , ability bend spine reach floor palm flat ground . Gait participant assess condition shoe , foot orthoses , supramalleolar orthoses . This order determine select condition random hat , first condition chosen perform assess first . Gait parameter include step length , step width , walk speed , percentage time spend single leg support , variability gait measure use GAITRite mat . The GAITRite measurement system include electronic walkway contain sensor pad , similar roll-out carpet . The GAITRite mat link computer , collect information gait participant walk across mat . The GAITRite mat , 20 foot long , set-up one segment circular track total walk distance loop 50 foot . Participants give accommodation period ten minute type orthoses prior gait assessment instruct walk around room GAITRite mat order get comfortable wearing orthoses walk along track . Once accommodation period complete one orthosis , participant walk around track three time . This procedure accommodation data collection repeat condition . Participants give verbal encouragement researcher walk track mean motivation . Rest period give participant request , behavioral cue display discomfort , pain , frustration occur . Data collection stop altogether participant 's request behavioral cue discomfort persist . Trials involve supramalleolar foot orthoses hypothesize increase step length , walk speed , time spend single leg support control trial shoe condition . Both orthoses also expect decrease step width , variability gait parameter . Supramalleolar orthoses , provide above-ankle support , expect improve gait parameter great magnitude foot orthoses participant score high hypermobility screen great tibial torsion ankle eversion cohort . Conversely , foot orthoses expect provide great improvement gait parameter supramalleolar orthoses participant score low hypermobility screen less tibial torsion ankle eversion cohort due need less external foot ankle support . An increase step length , walk speed , time spend single leg support , decrease step width variability gait indicate positive result orthoses use . Students physical therapy University Puget Sound Physical Therapy Program perform measurement , exception orthotic size case . One researcher perform anthropometric measurement hypermobility screen participant . A second researcher operate GAITRite mat , third researcher guide instruct participant along GAITRite mat course .</detailed_description>
