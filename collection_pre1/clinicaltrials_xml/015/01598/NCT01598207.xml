	<brief_summary>Background : Noncardiac chest pain ( NCCP ) affect 200,000 new case annually USA . It associate poor quality life high health care expenditure 8 Billion Dollars year . Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) , esophageal motility disorder , psychological issue may cause NCCP . The mechanism ( ) pain continue explore include central peripheral hypersensitivity , mechanophysical abnormality . Treatment NCCP focus relieve visceral hypersensitivity pain modulators , tricyclic , trazodone , adenosine receptor antagonist , theophylline . Typically , 40-50 % respond clearly large unmet therapeutic need . Cannabis felt beneficial vomiting , diarrhea intestinal pain . The main component Cannabis act specific receptor , locate primarily central peripheral neuron ( include enteric nervous system ) myenteric plexus modulate neurotransmitter release . Activation receptor reduce excitatory enteric transmission may improve esophageal hyperreactivity hypersensitivity , hallmarks NCCP . STUDY PROTOCOL : The investigator randomize 40 subject non-cardiac , non-reflux chest pain receive dronabinol ( 5 mg Bid ) , placebo 4 week . Chest pain symptom esophageal sensorimotor property assess baseline 4 week use symptom diary impedance planimetry . The primary outcome measure frequency chest pain episode . Secondary outcome measure include improvement esophageal sensory threshold , reduce reactive contraction , frequency , amplitude , area curve , global improvement symptom . HYPOTHESIS : Cannabinoids decrease esophageal hypersensitivity ameliorate chest pain NCCP patient , compare placebo . AIM : To perform randomize double blind study investigate effect Dronabinol , CB1 CB2 agonist , treatment patient NCCP examine mechanism action .</brief_summary>
