	<brief_summary>Elevated LDL-cholesterol major risk factor heart disease . In patient heart disease LDL-cholesterol lower level 70 mg/dl prevent progression disease . In patient life style modification together lipid lower drug therapy sufficient achieve goal . In patient severe form hypercholesterolemia , may sufficient reach goal regular lipid apheresis ( costly time intensive form therapy ) may perform . Mipomersen new drug ( apoB antisense oligonucleotide ) low LDL-cholesterol even severe form LDL-hypercholesterolemia 25-47 % . It unknown whether extent mipomersen decrease LDL-cholesterol patient treat regular apheresis . Phase 1 study test 6 month weekly therapy mipomersen affect LDL-cholesterol patient severe LDL-hypercholesterolemia treat regular apheresis . Phase 2 test many patient result meaningful reduction apheresis time , apheresis frequency apheresis stop completely .</brief_summary>
