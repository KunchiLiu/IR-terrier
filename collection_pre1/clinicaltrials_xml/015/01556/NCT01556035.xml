	<brief_summary>In spite high initial response rate first line treatment R-polychemotherapy , cutaneous also extra-cutaneous recurrence occur 2 year half patient PCBCL-LT . Thereafter consensus concern patient care : radiotherapy palliative effect , advanced age often limit use aggressive chemotherapy treatment demonstrate prolonged efficacy relapse case . Therefore new alternative therapeutic option need . Lenalidomide antineoplastic pro-apoptotic effect also immunomodulatory , antiangiogenic property . Preliminary result suggest efficacy relapse refractory diffuse large B-cells lymphoma , especially nongerminal cell phenotype . By analogy result , lenalidomide appear attractive candidate PCLBCL-LT , specially manageable toxicity even advance age patient . If lenalidomide efficacy confirm relapse PCLBCL-LT , plead evaluation maintenance therapy R-chemotherapy order avoid recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To assess benefit safety lenalidomide patient refractory relapse primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma leg type ( PCBCL-LT ) first line treatment Rituximab polychemotherapy . The primary endpoint overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) 6 month . Response assess accord clinical isotopic criterion . Optional biological study : A biological collection ( skin blood sample ) establish . Predictive biological marker response aggressiveness resistance treatment investigate skin biopsy phenotypic genetic analysis . The recent discovery BLIMP1 inactivation deletion 6q21 activate B-cell like type diffuse large B-cell systemic lymphoma point need global genetic analysis Array-CGH Single Nucleotide Polymorphism study specific investigation status gene CDKN2A , BCL2 , BCL6 BLIMP1 FISH analysis and/or gene dosage . Xenograft perform skin biopsy order develop animal model PCLBCL-LT. Lenalidomide stimulate NK cell immunity enhance anti-tumor response . It also seem modify phenotype NK cell decrease expression Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors NKp46 . The expression NK receptor blood cell analyzed order evidence modification phenotypical functional change treatment , search correlation clinical response treatment .</detailed_description>
