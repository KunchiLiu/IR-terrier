	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability 4 dos lomitapide ( AEGR-733 ; BMS-201038 ) give initial low dose escalate additional 3 dose level 16-week period . The secondary objective study include evaluation pharmacodynamics lomitapide base : - Percent change low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDL-C ) concentration end 4-week dosing period compare Baseline value parameter end previous dose phase ( ) . - Changes plasma lipoprotein : apolipoproteins ( apo B , apo AI , apo AII , apo CIII , apo E ) lipoprotein [ Lp ( ) ] .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label , Phase 2 clinical trial design evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamics lomitapide treatment patient homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) . Patients required stop lipid-lowering therapy , include apheresis , within 4 week prior Baseline visit throughout study . Patients place rigorous low-fat diet ( &lt; 10 % energy total dietary fat ) Screening assessment ; dietary counseling register dietitian initiated Screening continue subsequent study visit . Patients initially receive 0.03 mg/kg lomitapide orally every day 4 week . Intra-patient dose escalation 0.1 mg/kg , 0.3 mg/kg/day 1.0 mg/kg/day occur every 4 week specific protocol-defined stopping rule relate Grade 3 4 toxicity serious adverse event ( SAEs ) apply . The study include 15 study visit 22 week : Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) conduct within 2 week prior dose , Baseline visit ( Visit 2 ) conduct Day 1 prior first dose , 12 visit conduct treatment period ( Visits 3 14 ) , Follow-up visit ( Visit 15 ) conduct approximately 4 week last dose lomitapide . Screening Baseline procedure include medical medication history , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) , safety laboratory test , fat soluble vitamin level fatty acid profile . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMRS ) liver conduct Baseline , end dosing period , follow visit ass hepatic fat content . Baseline efficacy assessment include fast lipid profile ( TC , LDL-C [ directly measure ] , VLDL-C , high density lipoprotein-cholesterol [ HDL-C ] , triglyceride , apolipoproteins [ apo B , apo AI , apo AII , apo CIII , apo E ] Lp ( ) ) . Safety lipid profile assessment repeat treatment period Follow-up visit conduct 28 day last dose lomitapide .</detailed_description>
