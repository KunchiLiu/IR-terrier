	<brief_summary>This project first comprehensive prospective study clinically non-functioning pituitary adenoma ( CNFAs ) . Two group subject study : Group I consist 100 patient clinically non-functioning ( CNF ) pituitary lesion asymptomatic require surgery ; Group II consist 250 patient pituitary lesion symptomatic require surgery . Patients follow series endocrine laboratory testing , physical examination , test quality life neurocognitive function serially time either non-surgical management surgery patient radiotherapy ( RT ) . Data pituitary magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study visual field test do time follow part clinical care collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL I : Prospective Study outcome conservative non-surgical management patient asymptomatic , clinically non-functioning ( CNF ) pituitary lesion . This protocol evaluate prospectively outcome non-surgical management clinically non-functioning pituitary lesion appear need surgery initial therapy . The overall design consist initial baseline evaluation serial prospective follow study time 5 year follow . The study evaluate laboratory testing , clinical examination , quality life neurocognitive function patient . We also collect data visual field MRI study pituitary tumor do prospectively part clinical care evaluate patient . Data collect include prevalence pituitary dysfunction presentation , safety conservative non-surgical management patient asymptomatic , clinically nonfunctioning pituitary lesion respect development symptomatic tumor enlargement pituitary dysfunction , prevalence silent corticotroph tumor type characterize elevate plasma level adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) precursor , pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) , associate increase tumor recurrence rate prospectively assess quality life neurocognitive function patient clinically non-functioning pituitary lesion treat without surgery . PROTOCOL II : Prospective study outcome patient symptomatic , clinically non-functioning pituitary tumor treat transsphenoidal surgery case also radiotherapy . This protocol evaluate prospectively outcome surgical management asymptomatic clinically nonfunctioning pituitary lesion . The overall design consist initial baseline evaluation serial prospective follow study time 5 year follow . The study evaluate laboratory testing , clinical examination , quality life neurocognitive function patient . We also collect data visual field MRI study pituitary tumor do prospectively part clinical care evaluate patient . Data collect analyzed determine safety observation alone follow surgery patient clinically significant tumor remnant , silent corticotroph tumor type characterize elevate plasma level ACTH precursor , POMC , associate increased tumor recurrence rate . A group patient plan RT also study procedure RT order determine outcomes patient receive RT treatment tumor re-growth receive RT respect tumor growth , endocrine neurological dysfunction . We also prospectively assess quality life neurocognitive function patient clinically non-functioning pituitary lesion treat surgery alone also receive radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
