	<brief_title>A Study Lenalidomide Maintenance High-risk Patients With CLL Following First-line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLLM1 phase 3 multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study design evaluate efficacy safety lenalidomide administer maintenance treatment subject CLL respond first-line therapy ( induction ) achieve response least PR high risk early progression . This study compare efficacy lenalidomide maintenance treatment versus placebo prolong progression free survival ( PFS ) ; secondary endpoint ass overall survival , safety lenalidomide treatment evaluate Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) kinetics peripheral blood whilst subject maintenance . Although maintenance therapy establish recent year treatment subset subject Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) , novel concept management CLL . It regularly use limited number small study conduct evaluate consolidation/maintenance therapy limit period time alemtuzumab rituximab . Based limited amount available data , appear maintenance therapy may improve quality remission CLL subject prolong progression-free survival ( PFS ) . A large phase 3 trial investigate lenalidomide maintenance follow response second line therapy ongoing . However , large well-controlled study conduct investigate beneficial effect maintenance therapy follow front line therapy ; specifically subject aggressive disease . This phase 3 study evaluate whether lenalidomide maintenance therapy prolong PFS CLL subject high risk early progression follow first line treatment .</detailed_description>
