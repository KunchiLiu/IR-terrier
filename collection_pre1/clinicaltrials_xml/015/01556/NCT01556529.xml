	<brief_title>CDRM Study : Computer-assisted Diabetes Risk Management-for Secondary Tertiary Prevention T2DM Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study determine effect computer-assisted diabetes risk management ( CDRM ) system compliance outcome . All subject Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) patient enrol National T2DM Disease Management Programme ( DMP ) offer German National Health Insurance System . Of people live Germany 90 % insure ; 60 % T2DM patient insure - voluntarily - enrol T2DM-DMP . As DMP , rationale regular visit attend physician , strict application National Guidelines keep patient narrow corridor optimal biomedical parameter ( SBP , DBP , BMI , specific lab parameter ) , probability complication , hospitalization functional impairment minimize . The rationale study information individual risk profile change course care lead patient empowerment add effective prevent manifestation risk . The Intervention Group , addition receive T2DM care standard accord National Guidelines issue AWMF , within framework National T2DM Disease Management Programme , receive individualize report show personal risk characteristic T2DM complication . Reports send attend general practitioner ( GP ) communicate explain patient . The CDRM system entail combination several telematic instrument use patient , GP medical specialist . Key functionalities network support care approach software integration GP practice automate data record via digital device blood glucose meter . Furthermore , CDRM-Tool , Accu-Chek Mellibase client server application Roche Diagnostics GmbH connect system . It generate report - one physician one patient - current health status , describe 10 year risk develop characteristic complication ( separately myocardial infarction , stroke , kidney failure , blindness , amputation ) potential reduce risk . These report shall use consultation help doctor patient communicate diabetes associated risk individual potential . The GP report shall ease doctor 's therapy decision . The patient report shall inform patient improve compliance , strengthen empowerment . The CDRM system gain information correlate basic patient data plus data recent medical finding recent diabetes research evidence . GPs intervention group get advice concern use CDRM system properly , ( extra ) intervention measure permit . In particular , therapy recommendation research team GPs decide individual therapy medication . The control group receive T2DM care standard accord National Guidelines issue AWMF , within framework National T2DM Disease Management Programme .</detailed_description>
