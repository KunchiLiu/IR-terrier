	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Breast-conserving surgery less invasive type surgery breast cancer may fewer side effect improve recovery . Radiation therapy use high-energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well breast-conserving surgery radiation therapy work treat patient multiple ipsilateral breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast-Conserving Surgery Radiation Therapy Patients With Multiple Ipsilateral Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess local recurrence ( LR ) rate breast-conservation patient multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer ( MIBC ) . Secondary - To examine conversion rate mastectomy secondary persistent positive margin ; poor cosmesis within first year attempt breast-conservation surgery ( BCS ) inability satisfy radiation dose constraint boost lumpectomy bed site disease . - To assess whether patient undergo re-excision close margin ( &lt; 2 mm ) high local recurrence ( LR ) rate patient negative margin achieve . - To assess patient 's perception cosmesis incidence breast lymphedema . - To assess incidence breast lymphedema - To examine type severity adverse effect breast conserve surgery radiation woman multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer ( MIBC ) . - To examine radiation-related side effect whole-breast radiation boost 1 large &gt; 1 lumpectomy site . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) lesion resect negative margin use 1 lumpectomy 2-3 separate lumpectomy incision discretion surgeon . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy discretion treat medical oncologist base tumor characteristic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Registration 1 . Age ≥ 40 year per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) recommendation breast conservation . 2 . Life Expectancy least 5 year , exclude diagnosis breast cancer ( Comorbid condition take consideration , breast cancer diagnosis consideration ) 3 . Female Gender Men exclude study . Male breast cancer rare event . Men rarely candidate breast conservation surgery due small breast size . Men less likely candidate breast conservation surgery find MIBC . Men rarely candidate breast conservation surgery due small breast size . Men less likely candidate breast conservation surgery find MIBC . 4 . Foci Breast Cancer 4.1 Upon clinical exam preoperative imaging mammogram +/ MRI , two three focus biopsy proven breast cancer separate &gt; 2 cm normal breast tissue . 4.2 Foci must include least one focus invasive breast carcinoma another focus either invasive breast carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . No 2 quadrant biopsy proven breast cancer . 4.3 Note : The short distance lesion must report mammogram +/ MRI eligibility criterion must meet , obtain . 4.4 Note : Patient eligible study lesion visualize image modality ( i.e. , lesion ( ) is/are visualize MRI mammogram OR visualize mammogram MRI ) . 4.5 Ultrasound use determine patient eligibility ; eligibility determine bilateral mammogram +/ MRI . 4.6 Fine needle aspirate second third lesion document malignancy allow first focus show invasive core needle biopsy . 4.7 Patient may remain study , upon pathological assessment , two three lesion identify preoperative image represent one contiguous lesion . 5 . Patients may register AFTER surgery PRIOR TO radiation therapy either criterion meet : 5.1 An area atypia &gt; 2cm index lesion excise time cancer operation upgrade DCIS invasive carcinoma thereby identify MIBC . OR 5.2 Patient underwent resection two three focus malignancy breast conservation surgery minimum one invasive focus breast cancer minimum 2 cm normal breast tissue lesion final pathology . 6 . Mammogram Imaging Bilateral mammogram ≤ 90 day prior date surgery . 6.1 Note : For patient undergo 1 breast operation , date first breast surgery breast cancer treatment . 7 . Staging Cancer cN0 cN1 disease 8 . ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 , 1 , 2 . 9 . Ability Complete Questionnaires Ability complete questionnaire ( ) assistance 10 . Ability Provide Written Informed Consent 11 . Willing Return Enrolling Institution Willing return enrol institution followup Active Monitoring Phase ( active treatment observation portion ) study . Patients encourage return enrol institution ; however , patient may receive radiation therapy different institution enrol institution . Registration 1 . Pregnancy , Nursing Requirement Contraception Pregnant woman , nurse woman woman childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception ( determined treat physician ) exclude participation . This study involve radiation therapy ( WBI ) know genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect . 2 . Size Single Focus Disease Preoperative Imaging Largest single focus disease &gt; 5 centimeter either mammogram MRI . Note : Measurement large single focus include satellite lesion within 1 centimeter index lesion . 3 . Prior Staging Procedure Surgical axillary staging procedure prior first definitive breast operation . Note : FNA core needle biopsy axillary node permit . 4 . Evidence Metastatic Disease Clinical radiographic evidence metastatic disease 5 . Prior History Breast Cancer Prior history ipsilateral breast cancer [ DCIS , LCIS ( lobular cancer situ ) invasive ] 6 . Staging Cancer cNX , cN2 , cN3 disease 7 . Breast Implants Breast implant time diagnosis . Note : Patients implant previously remove prior diagnosis eligible . 8 . Systemic Illnesses Concurrent Disease Comorbid systemic illness severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would interfere significantly whole breast irradiation ( connective tissue disorder , lupus , scleroderma ) . 9 . Uncontrolled Intercurrent Illness Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Bilateral Breast Cancer Prior current LCIS , DCIS invasive breast cancer opposite breast ( i.e. , bilateral disease allow ) . 11 . Disallowed Prior Treatments Treatment include radiation therapy , chemotherapy , biotherapy , hormonal therapy cancer prior surgery ( i.e. , neoadjuvant chemotherapy endocrine therapy allow ) . Patients undergo surgical resection breast conservation treat adjuvant systemic therapy eligible enroll prior start radiotherapy . 12 . Partial Breast Radiation Planned partial breast radiation . 13 . Known BRCA Mutations Patients know BRCA mutation . Patients test whose test result return time registration exclude register study . 14 . Other Active Malignancies Other active malignancy ≤ 5 year prior registration . 14.1 Exceptions : Nonmelanotic skin cancer carcinomainsitu cervix . 14.2 Note : If history prior malignancy , must receive specific treatment cancer .</criteria>
