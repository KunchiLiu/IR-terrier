	<brief_summary>Lung Cancer become first cause death related cancer France 's already case United States . At Present , Lung Cancer woman men treat similarly . Nevertheless , numerous study show lung cancer woman specificity : time diagnosis female patient young , less clinical sign , clinical stage earlier , histology often adenocarcinoma . The link tabagism weaker . Sensitivity tabagism high ( cancer woman tabagism ) . Response rate chemotherapy well . Prognosis well Numerous hypothesis put forward account specific characteristic female lung cancer describe . - One hypothesis different genetic anomaly woman . Some study show increase EGFR mutation HER2 expression decrease expression repair enzyme ( ERCC1 , RRM1 , BRCA ) explain increase sensitivity tabagism chemotherapy . - Another hypothesis hormone play role oncogenesis . Indeed , lung cancer present hormonal risk factor : pre-menopause , less 3 kid , short menstrual cycle , hormone replacement therapy . Estrogens would deleterious effect cancer incidence survival lung cancer woman . Cellular animal model show ER pathway activate lung cancer participate oncogenesis . - Moreover interaction RE EGFR pathway demonstrate lung cancer cell line mouse model . EGFR-TKI show benefit woman wild type EGFR unknown status ( erlotinib ) woman EGFR mutation ( gefitinib ) . In study , use two treatment accordance market authorisation . The objective study test addition anti-estrogen ( fulvestrant ) EGFR-TKI . Fulvestrant pure anti-oestrogen bind ER , block accelerates breakdown . It market authorisation breast cancer . Furthermore association EGFR-TKI anti-estrogen could synergetic effect due interaction RE EGFR pathway .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm predominant nonsquamous , nonsmall cell lung cancer The presence analysable tissue research EGFR activate mutation . Analysis must perform INCalabelled laboratory platforms accord validate technique Not suitable radiation , inoperable stage III stage IV Patients EGFR mutation must never take chemotherapy must progression one previous line chemotherapy ( include maintenance ) . Patients without EGFR mutation must receive one two line chemotherapy beforehand . Maintenance chemotherapy consider treatment line . Adjuvant chemotherapy consider first line treatment date back year Female Menopausal : old 60 year age history ovariectomy young 60 year old amenorrhoea 12 month FSH rate corresponds postmenopausal rate ( accord laboratory ) History cancer except skin cancer cancer date five year ago consider cure Known suspect Cerebral metastasis spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic without treatment stable treat surgery and/or radiation therapy . Corticosteroid treatment symptom must discontinue four week Pregnancy breastfeed Patient take hormone replacement therapy menopause stop two week start trial treatment A change bone marrow , kidney liver function inconsistent treatment</criteria>
