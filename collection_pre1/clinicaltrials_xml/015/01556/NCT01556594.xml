	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia common people type 1 diabetes . Mild moderate hypoglycaemia normally treat consume oral carbohydrate . During episode severe hypoglycaemia however , person diabetes unable consume carbohydrates require help another person . The current standard treatment severe hypoglycemia intravenous glucose injection glucagon , cause increase blood glucose , allow person diabetes recover sufficiently consume carbohydrate . AMG Medical investigate novel formulation glucagon may easier administer currently available glucagon formulation . In study , patient Type 1 diabetes receive inject insulin reduce blood glucose , receive one three dose new glucagon formulation dose glucagon injection , blood glucose measure 3 hour . The study hypothesis new glucagon formulation effective current inject formulation raise blood glucose level within 15 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On study day patient admit clinical site least 10 hour prior glucagon administration . Each patient weigh hospital gown even prior glucagon administration adjust insulin infusion rate individually . Blood glucose value measure use bedside rapid glucose analyzer . Blood glucose level control overnight prior dose . On morning dosing supervise overnight fast , hypoglycemia induce IV insulin infusion prior dose . Glucose level measure throughout IV insulin infusion process value ≤3.6 mmol/L observe , insulin infusion stop within 5 minute , subject treat one four treatment . Serial blood sample PK ( glucagon ) PD ( glucose ) assessment perform glucagon administration . In addition blood sample schedule glucose PD measurement , glucose level also measure regularly throughout procedure beside glucose analyzer safety monitoring patient . Minimally , measurement perform PK/PD blood draw . For study period administration sit closely evaluated tolerability . Before departure 6 hour glucagon administration , glucose insulin dose stabilization evaluate physician ensure safety patient . These procedure apply period study . Drug Administration Procedure In study period , single dose glucagon administer morning 10-hour overnight fast follow insulin-induced hypoglycemia , use either new glucagon formulation glucagon injection . Treatments 1 2 3 - New formulation : Treatment 4 - Subcutaneous administration : The approved dose level 1 mg glucagon inject skin A nurse clinical site overnight glucagon administration ensure safety patient . In addition , physician charge remain clinical site start insulin infusion morning least first 6 hour follow glucagon administration ensure patient re-stabilized regular insulin medication departure . The physician charge also remain available time entire period study . End study The following post-study test perform collection last blood sample study . - Physical examination - Laboratory test - Biochemistry - Hematology - Urinalysis - HCG beta serum pregnancy test ( female patient ) . - 12-lead ECG</detailed_description>
