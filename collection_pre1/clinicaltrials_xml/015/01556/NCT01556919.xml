	<brief_title>Esophageal Monitoring Device Assessing Mucosal Impedance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) , consent study participant series three ( 3 ) custom mucosal impedance ( MI ) catheters axial array sensor position along mucosal wall directly measure mucosal impedance various interval . Each catheter manually guide physician work channel endoscope sensored tip visible scope camera . The physician place sensored ring directly mucosa along lumen . To obtain evaluable data , sensor must remain contact mucosa point 5 second stable impedance reading capture . This process repeat three prototype catheter consent patient order determine optimal catheter/sensor design . The catheter attach channeled feed record measurement dedicate computer .</detailed_description>
