	<detailed_description>This study design proof concept MEK162 NS HCM patient . The purpose present study determine whether ability MEK162 antagonize MEK activation NS HCM patient , usually upstream mutation Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway lead MEK activation , would beneficial 6 month treatment period cause hypertrophy regression . Such regression might result cardiovascular clinical benefit long term treatment . The information gain study three fold : 1. safety/tolerability treatment MEK162 6 month NS HCM patient population 2. pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics MEK162 target patient population 3. proof therapeutic concept MEK inhibition reduce cardiac hypertrophy target NS HCM patient population</detailed_description>
