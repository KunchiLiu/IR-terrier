	<brief_summary>This study determine prevalence small bowel lesion suggestive Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patient moderate severe plaque psoriasis use capsule endoscopy . The study also aim determine treatment psoriasis adalimumab effect heal small bowel patient lesion suggestive CD . Patients psoriasis increase risk develop Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , exact prevalence CD patient psoriasis time unknown many patient probably undiagnosed disease early sign often cause symptom . CD therefore receive little attention dermatologist treat patient psoriasis . For example , dermatologists actively question patient psoriasis symptoms CD . This lack knowledge may induce delay diagnosis . By time diagnosis make patient receive first treatment , may already significant fibrosis stenosis intestine . Current treatment , include adalimumab , reverse small bowel anomaly normal presence fibrosis . Therefore , many patient late diagnosis still symptoms eventually require surgery despite good control inflammation . Treatment CD start early possible , early treatment associate increased rate complete healing . Complete control disease early stage may prevent complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , phase IV , 24-week study recruit total 100 patient moderate severe plaque psoriasis without diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease . All patient undergo capsule endoscopy begin study detect presence small bowel lesion suggestive CD erosion ulcer . All patient receive adalimumab 80 mg follow 40 mg week 1 40 mg every week ( EOW ) thereafter . Patients small bowel lesion suggestive CD detect remain study adalimumab therapy week 12 . A second capsule endoscopy perform 24 week initiation adalimumab patient small bowel lesion suggestive CD evaluate change bowel inflammation .</detailed_description>
