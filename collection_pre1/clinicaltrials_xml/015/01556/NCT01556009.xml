	<detailed_description>This Phase II , 28 month , randomize , two arm multicenter clinical study design . During initial 7 month study , 24 subject receive vismodegib , 150mg/day . They randomize 1:1 ratio receive intermittent vismodegib , 150 mg/day , month 10-13 , 16-19 , 22-25 receive treatment PDT month 10 three month interval thereafter . The safety efficacy intermittent vismodegib PDT assess time subject ' visit Study Center time telephone contact . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review result interim analysis 12 subject complete 28 month . The DSMB review focus adverse event efficacy result .
