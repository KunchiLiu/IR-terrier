	<brief_title>The Activity TroVax® Versus Placebo Relapsed Asymptomatic Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant number patient advanced ovarian cancer develop `` CA-125 relapse '' without clinical symptom low volume disease CT scan . For group patient , survival benefit demonstrate early chemotherapy treatment , average , time start chemotherapy 5 month . Such patient could benefit immunotherapy time chemotherapy could potentially prolong . Multiple immunotherapy agent , anti-CA-125 antibody various vaccine , test , although plenty evidence immune response , translate definitive clinical benefit recommend clinical practice 5T4 appear highly express ovarian cancer correlate advance stage disease poorly differentiate tumour . TroVax® , vaccine target 5T4 , extensive record safety efficacy human vaccination patient colorectal , renal , prostate cancer result immune cellular humoral response sign clinical benefit . We propose trial TroVax® vaccination patient CA-125-relapsed asymptomatic ovarian cancer ass clinical efficacy immunological response outline protocol . To allow capture delay response immunotherapy , patient progress RECIST 1.1 criterion experience toxicity treatment continue vaccine/placebo injection repeat image 8 week order immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) evaluate addition RECIST 1.1 criterion ( patient standard care would receive therapeutic intervention ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged ≥18 year histologically cytologically proven advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma , fallopian tube carcinoma primary peritoneal carcinoma Stage IC1 III Stage IVA ( pleural effusion ) diagnosis . ( According new FIGO stag effective 01/01/2014 ) Completed cytoreductive surgery phase firstline therapy include removal bulky tumour mass adequate surgical stag include minimum bilateral salpingooophorectomy , hysterectomy omentectomy Completed first line platinumbased chemotherapy OR Completed first line platinumbased chemotherapy second line chemotherapy type complete response second line treatment accord RECIST 1.1 Have develop relapse ≥6 month platinumbased chemotherapy ( case second relapse , disease free interval also ≥6 month ) Normal CA125 follow platinumbased chemotherapy Have develop asymptomatic relapse define : 1 . CA125 ≥ 2xULN OR 2 . Low volume radiological disease CA125 &gt; ULN Low volume radiological disease define radiologically visible disease exclude intrahepatic ( parenchymal ) liver splenic metastasis , ascites pleural effusion think require drainage within next 2 month . The follow acceptable : Subcapsular liver splenic lesion , benign lesion cyst , suspicious lesion may represent metastasis confirm image nonmetastatic . Currently asymptomatic require chemotherapy . Subject assume clinically immunocompetent free clinically apparent/active autoimmune disease ( i.e . prior confirmed diagnosis treatment autoimmune disease include Systemic Lupus Erythematosis , Grave 's disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis ) . Note : subject type I type II diabetes mellitus include , subject control rarely flare rheumatoid disease ( defined recent flare within 6 month prior randomisation ) Subject adequate bone marrow function define Haemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L , white cell count ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L , Absolute Lymphocyte Count ( ALC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L , Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelet Count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L &lt; 400 x 10^9/L , Monocytes &lt; 0.8 x 10^9/L ( patient undergone previous splenectomy monocyte count &lt; 1.2 x 10^9/L ) Adequate endorgan function : plasma creatinine ≤ 2x upper limit normal , AST and/or ALT ≤ 2x upper limit normal , Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ECOG performance status 01 Life expectancy ≥6 month willing available attend clinic visit treatment followup Ability give write informed consent To treat later 14 day randomisation Carcinosarcoma/MMMT Cancer relate symptom , disease recurrence require immediate treatment Patients low volume radiological disease follow site trial entry : Accumulating ascites think require drainage within next 2 month Pleural effusion think require drainage within next 2 month Intraparenchymal Liver and/or splenic metastasis CT scan showing bulky disease require chemotherapy , judge investigator Major surgery/radiation therapy , immunotherapy chemotherapy complete &lt; 4 week prior randomisation Patients deem immunosuppressed , receive &gt; 4 week parenteral oral steroid , ( nasal spray inhaler permit ) , receive immunosuppressive therapy follow transplant Chronic ( ≥ 6 month ) oral corticosteroid use except prescribed replacement therapy case adrenal insufficiency . If previously use ≥6 month must discontinue ≥3 month prior randomisation . `` Currently active '' second malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer . Subjects consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy ≥3 year previously know evidence residual recurrent disease Concomitant use complementary medicines/botanicals .
