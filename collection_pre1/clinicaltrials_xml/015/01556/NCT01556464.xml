	<brief_summary>This study test follow hypothesis : 1 . Treatment newly diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) acutely ill patient auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) would result few in-hospital complication , compare treatment ( primary outcome ) . 2 . Treatment newly identify OSA acutely ill patient auto-adjusting CPAP would result short length stay , low re-admission rate , good blood pressure ( BP ) control , good long term compliance OSA treatment , compare treatment ( secondary outcome ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study perform randomize control prospective study patient admit general medical floor MetroHealth Medical Center ( MHMC ) . This study add-on investigation original fund study : `` Evaluation Screening Tools Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Hospitalized Medical Patients : A Validation Study '' ( STOMP study ) . In STOMP study , patient admit Sunday Thursday ( day night ) MHMC meet inclusion/exclusion criterion willing participate study complete STOMP study undergo in-hospital PSG ( within 48 hour admission medical floor ) . Those 's PSG show clinically significant OSA ( apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 5 ) approach participation study . It anticipate least 50 patient STOMP study eligible randomization study . Participants randomize auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( ACPAP ) ( ResMed S9 ) arm standard therapy arm ( control - specific therapy OSA possibly supplemental nocturnal oxygen deem necessary clinician care patient ) . Those randomized ACPAP continue therapy undergo repeat diagnostic sleep study ( PSG ) , indicate , titration PSG outpatient . Those standard therapy arm receive specific treatment OSA undergo repeat diagnostic study , indicate , full night titration PSG outpatient . Once titration PSG take place , subject change fix CPAP follow additional 6-8 week ass compliance therapy .</detailed_description>
