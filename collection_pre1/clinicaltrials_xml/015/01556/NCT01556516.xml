	<detailed_description>Pompe disease ( glycogen storage disease type II ) lysosomal storage disorder result deficiency enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase . Similar many lysosomal storage disease , phenotypic spectrum Pompe disease vary , exist infantile , late-onset form . In classic infantile form , patient develop cardiomyopathy , result premature death . In later-onset form , proximal muscle weakness similar limb-girdle muscular dystrophy , associate progressive weakness different muscle group . The primary morbidity Pompe disease associate progressive respiratory insufficiency . Events act metabolic stressor , general , pregnancy may act modifier lysosomal storage disorder . In much study Gaucher disease , pregnancy increase risk acute bone crisis , even otherwise asymptomatic patient . However , similar study lack Pompe disease . Most data use counsel patient Pompe disease derive muscular dystrophy , obstetric risk complication . This retrospective case review study female subject age 18years . This study investigate effect acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency pregnancy , pregnancy disease outcomes patient adult-onset Pompe disease . The study define immediate effect enzyme replacement therapy Lumizyme/Myozyme outcomes pregnancy fetus . Subjects invited participate initial mail phone contact . If patient interested , agree participate study study questionnaire provide . The patient , need complete questionnaire , sign date mail back along release medical information form . The returned sign dated questionnaire patient serve indication consent participate study . Alternatively , study PI coordinator may review questionnaire subject phone interview . However , subject 's signature still require attest participate study .</detailed_description>
