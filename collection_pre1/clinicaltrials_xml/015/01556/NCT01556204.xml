	<brief_title>Laparoscopy vs. Robotic Surgery Endometriosis ( LAROSE ) : Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize control trial . Study subject recruit patient present Department Gynecology surgery endometriosis Cleveland Clinic . Patient require bowel resection and/or ureteral reanastomosis include due fact event impact operating time significantly commonly perform part endometriosis surgery ( subject may equally distribute among arm ) . Eligible patient agree participate provide write informed consent administer collaborator list Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) clinic location . In addition standardize evaluation include history physical examination , patient complete validate health-related quality life questionnaires SF-12 Endometriosis Health Profile-30 ( EHP-30 ) additional question determine baseline pain activity scale well daily pain medication use . Surgeries perform two board certify gynecologic surgeon ( TF JG ) . JG participate laparoscopic arm study ( Beachwood Family Health Surgery Center ) TF participate arm ( Cleveland Clinic main campus ) . The patient JG randomize robotic surgery perform TF Cleveland Clinic main campus . Additionally , surgery , patient complete questionnaire well diary address narcotic use quality life 6 week 6 month . Completion questionnaires diary additional assessment specific participation study usually include part standard care treatment endometriosis . It take 10 minute complete questionnaire le 5 minute day complete diary . The study subject expose additional risk participate study except inconvenience complete questionnaire daily diary . The participant randomize preoperatively ( time surgery scheduling ) accord computer-generated randomization schedule random block size use SAS statistical software package ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . All patient blind assignment . Intraoperative randomization patient feasible due fact operate room staff operate room assign give case different robotic traditional laparoscopic case . Patients choose participate study still offer standard evaluation management include laparoscopic treatment endometriosis deem appropriate primary surgeon . Robotic-assisted laparoscopic treatment endometriosis routinely perform institution however , thus consider part standard care . Laparoscopic assist resection endometriosis perform use five 5mm . port . An umbilical port place laparoscope additional port dictate individual surgery . The robotic-assisted resection endometriosis perform use da Vinci Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) use five port need . An umbilical port place laparoscope ( 10/12mm ) , 5mm assistant port place right low quadrant two three 8 mm robotic port place low quadrant bilaterally . The technique resection superficial deep endometriosis perform standard fashion . All superficial lesion suspicious endometriosis ( pigmented non-pigmented ) completely resect non-diseased peritoneal margin visualize around defect fulgurized use bipolar energy ; deep lesion suspicious endometriosis completely resect non-diseased margin visualize tissue surround defect . Cystectomy ( y ) perform endometrioma ( ) . The fascia port great equal 10mm reapproximated . Cystoscopy would perform deemed appropriate surgeon ( e.g. , assess low urinary tract injury case require extensive ureterolysis ) . Patients find endometriosis time surgery exclude study . The robot dock case assign arm irrespective amount disease encounter ( include mild endometriosis ) . Data point record procedure include : operating room time entry exit time incision closure . From information , operating room cost anesthesia cost , i.e. , amount provider must pay good service , calculate . Estimated blood loss , perioperative post-operative complication , number day hospital ( case warrant admission ) calculate . The standard American Society Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM ) intraoperative endometriosis score system document end surgery . Procedure inpatient hospital cost ( applicable ) also determine . All operating room data ( include primary outcome ) collect research nurse coordinator assign task ( optimize reliability measurement ) . Patients complete daily narcotic use , include oral well patient-controlled analgesia IV narcotic use hospital applicable well quality life diary . Patients return clinic two week post-operative visit . Prior surgery , patient undergo physical examination physician blind patient 's surgical group assignment . Additionally , patient fill SF-12 health survey , EHP-30 activity assessment questionnaire , pain scale daily pain medication / narcotic use baseline . At 2 week postoperative visit , routine physical exam perform , daily pain medication diary retrieve questionnaire surgical pain activity assessment apply . At 6 week 6 month , nurse physician repeat questionnaire email ( use Redcap ) , mail questionnaire telephone ( SF-12 , EHP-30 , pain scale , daily pain medication / narcotic use activity assessment questionnaire ) . The physician nurse also collect intraoperative inpatient data project well review medical record possible admission postoperative complication . All data point demographic information record secure , password protect database Gynresearch drive assess collaborator IRB . Subjects identify Cleveland Clinic medical record number . It necessary identify patient manner clinical progress ( e.g . postoperative complication , emergency room visit ) locate recorded database .</detailed_description>
