	<detailed_description>The purpose current study propose prospectively validate BrainScope Ahead速 M-100 device design , performance , label respect device 's target intend use indication use : - Primary Endpoint : - Structural Injury Assessment - There four co-primary endpoint study : two set sensitivity specificity divide data three class . - Using BrainScope classification algorithm , Ahead速 M100 identify subject show sensitivity among 3 class : Green-normal , nonhead injured control , Yellow-head injured subject exhibit brain electrical activity consistent structural brain injury observable CT CT deem necessary , Red-head injured subject exhibit brain electrical activity consistent structural brain injury observable CT. - Secondary Endpoint : - Functional Injury Assessment - There two co-secondary endpoint secondary objective , sensitivity specificity split Yellow primary endpoint two sub group depend degree brain functional impairment observable evaluation clinical finding clinical charter use assessment truth .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female age 18 80 ( entire age range ) , admit Emergency Department ( ED ) , suspect traumatically induced structural brain injury and/or clinical manifestation functional brain injury , result insult head external force , e.g. , head strike object , head strike object , head expose force generate blast explosion , and/or brain undergoing acceleration/deceleration movement without direct external trauma head Glasgow Coma Scale &gt; 8 . The acute , suspect traumatically induced structural brain injury and/or clinical manifestation functional brain injury occur within past 24 hour upon admission ED . The ED normal control group males female age 18 80 ( entire age range ) , admit ED present complaint involve head neck ( trauma clavicle ) history MVA require ED visit TBI within past one ( 1 ) year , primary complaint syncope Subjects exclude forehead , scalp , skull abnormality condition would prevent correct application electrode headset skin . In addition , subject dementia , Parkinson 's Disease , multiple sclerosis , seizure disorder , brain tumor , history brain surgery , mentally retarded , psychiatric disorder prescribe psychiatric medication take daily basis , substance dependence , history TIA stroke within last year , currently receive dialysis endstage renal disease , active fever define great 100oF 37.7oC , current condition list `` critical '' opinion investigator , subject suffer open head injury , subject require advanced airway management ( i.e . mechanical ventilation ) , currently receive procedural sedation medication ( e.g . benzodiazepine , anesthetic , NMDA receptor antagonist , opioid agonist ) , subject age 18 year , pregnant woman , prisoner eligible study . ED normal control subject exclude suspected neck injury trauma clavicle , primary complaint generalize weakness , primary complaint headache migraine</criteria>
