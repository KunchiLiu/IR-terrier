	<brief_title>The Separate Combined Effects Vivitrol Opiate Abstinence Reinforcement Treatment Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injection heroin use chronic problem fuel transmission HIV/AIDS risky injection behavior . Methadone buprenorphine reduce heroin use risky injection behavior ; however , abuse potential , produce physical dependence , produce lethal overdose , highly regulate , patient simply want agonist treatment . Opiate detoxification serve alternative agonist treatment , many injection drug user relapse heroin use resume risky injection behavior detoxification . Vivitrol® , extend release formulation naltrexone , recently approve FDA treatment opioid dependence , clinical utility uncertain give reluctance many opioid-dependent adult maintain long-term use , fact patient continue use opiate naltrexone blockade . The investigator research first period grant show employment-based reinforcement highly effective promote long-term adherence Vivitrol® . Employment-based reinforcement may ideally suit address limitation extend release naltrexone capitalize potential simultaneously reinforce naltrexone adherence opiate abstinence . This grant evaluate effectiveness employment-based reinforcement simultaneously promote high rate Vivitrol® adherence increase opiate abstinence . After opioid detoxification induction onto oral naltrexone , participant invite attend Therapeutic Workplace 24 week ( work earn wage ) randomly assign one four group differ whether receive Vivitrol® , employment-based opiate abstinence reinforcement , neither . Participants Vivitrol® condition require take schedule injection work earn wage . Participants expose opiate abstinence reinforcement receive temporary decrease workplace pay fail provide opiate-free urine sample . The study assess effect intervention weekly opiate urinalysis result , measure injection drug use cocaine use . If study show combine use Vivitrol® employment-based reinforcement adherence opiate abstinence effective maintain long-term opiate abstinence , model employment-based addiction pharmacotherapy could integrate community workplace disseminate effective use Vivitrol® ; could use enhance utility new antagonist-like addiction medication ; could provide effective mean reduce injection drug use individual persist inject heroin expose others risk acquire transmit HIV infection due continue injection drug use risky injection behavior .</detailed_description>
