	<detailed_description>Transplant candidate HLA alloantibody high risk antibody mediate rejection ( AMR ) , graft failure , acute rejection ( 1,2 ) . In heart transplantation , complication lead death . The 50 % CPRA threshold choose consensus statement International Society Heart Lung Transplantation ( 3 ) . This value admittedly arbitrary represent consensus accept opinion amongst experience reputable heart transplant center . The alloantibody prevent patient transplant result adaptive immune system immunologic memory . Immunologic memory define ability immune system provide fast , strong specific response second exposure antigen , antigen completely eliminate organism prior exposure . There three major cell line involve immunologic memory : memory T cell , memory B cell plasma cell , survive antigen eliminate ( 4 ) . B cell mount response small soluble antigen large antigen ( 5 ) . Once B cell becomes activate , become short lived plasma cell produce IgM antibody enter germinal center undergo somatic hypermutation affinity maturation isotype switching . The B cell differentiate long live plasma cell compete bone marrow niche become memory B cell ( 4-8 ) . Memory T cell last lifetime recirculate secondary lymphoid organ ( SLO ) central memory T cell ( TCM ) peripheral tissue effector memory T cell ( TEM ) ( 4,9 ) . Upon encounter cognate antigen , rapidly proliferate differentiate effector T cell . Memory B cell slowly proliferate recirculate SLOs , last decade memory B cell vaccinia ( smallpox ) note survive 50 year ( 9 ) . They commonly identify presence CD27 upon second antigenic challenge ; memory B cell rapidly proliferate differentiate new plasma cell ( 10 ) . This phenomenon provide redundant system `` array '' replenish plasma cell produce antibody give antigen . Plasma cell highly differentiate specific cell actively produce alloantibody . There two population plasma cell , short-lived long-lived ( 8 ) . Long-lived plasma cell last life appear within less 1 week antigenic stimulation ( 6,7 ) . In core biopsy kidney transplant recipient , B cell , memory B cell , plasmablast plasma cell identify acute rejection ( 11 ) . The plasma cell end differentiate therefore proliferate . In bone marrow , finite number survival niche ( 109 ) dependent number stromal cell present support . Plasma cell n't find sanctuary marrow lose sanctuary last day , probably owe intense metabolic demand cell produce 10,000 20,000 copy antibody per second ( 12 ) . Plasma cell currently think without negative feedback loop suppress antibody synthesis . Plasma cell demonstrate FcγRIIB receptor couple immunoreceptor tyrosine base inhibitory motif ( ITIM ) ( 13 ) . The FcγRIIB receptor low affinity receptor bind monomeric IgG . The homeostasis immunoglobulin think mainly responsibility endothelial cell ( 14 ) . Once antibody produce , endothelial cell eliminate circulate antibody lysosomal degradation recycle antibody FcRn ( Fc receptor neonatal ) receptor dependent mechanism back plasma . A successful plan eliminate memory give antigenic encounter must address three separate system `` array . '' The elimination immunologic memory deleterious antibody could remove new favorable antibody create would significant advance field transplantation autoimmunity . A review medication use IND 110875 elucidate protocol may successful others fail . RATG anti-T-cell property , particular , activity memory T-cell surface antigen , thereby cause complement mediate T-cell death peripheral blood apoptosis spleen lymph node ( 15 ) . RATG antibodies CD27 , CD38 , HLA-DR demonstrate anti-memory B cell property vitro vivo ( 15-17 ) . The combination rATG rituximab decrease CD27 positive B cell spleen patient desensitization trial otherwise unsuccessful significant observation ( 16 ) . Rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , strong activity B-cells deplete B cell circulation 5-7 month . But B-cells differentiate plasma cell , CD20 surface marker regulate , concomitant loss sensitivity rituximab ( 18 ) . Rituximab use variety autoimmune disease ( 19,20 ) . Many antibody affect others decreased period time . Short live plasma cell may decrease since ready supply B cell replace short three day half-life . In study systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) use rituximab ; flow cytometry autoantibody specificity study reveal antibody Ro52 La44 measles decrease antibody dsDNA C1q decrease ( 19 ) . The overall amount immunoglobulin change . Plasma cell affect anti-CD20 , antibody production long live plasma cell continue unabated . Memory B-cells CD 27+ variable expression CD20 . A study desensitize kidney transplant candidate show rituximab decrease number CD27+ memory B cell plasma cell spleen ( 16 ) . In ( SLE ) patient treat rituximab cell return depletion largely naïve B cell plasmablasts 2.3 time high baseline ( 19 ) . While memory B cell circulate blood low rituximab therapy , memory B cell spleen appear unaffected transform plasmablasts secrete soluble antibody . This observation explain antibody disappear , least temporarily rituximab others . If antibody come primarily short live plasma cell plasmablast , rituximab likely effect ; antibody produce cell short half-life dependent upon continuous proliferation B cell . Antibodies produce long-lived plasma cell affect rituximab . Rituximab affect memory B cell spleen , rapidly reform plasmablast plasma cell reconstitute cell line produce certain clone antibody . Since memory B-cells become antibody secrete plasma cell , advantageous remove transplantation highly sensitized patient . The combination rATG rituximab show human reduce memory B cell spleen ( 16 ) . This finding yet incorporate desensitization protocol protocol autoimmune therapy review literature . No therapy effectively reduce memory B cell human represent novel aspect IND 110875 . No agent previously use transplantation , include rATG rituximab , ability inhibit mature plasma cell find refuge bone marrow , therefore little effect reduce antibody production . However , bortezomib , proteasome inhibitor use treatment multiple myeloma , ability deplete plasma cell via many mechanism . Proteasome inhibition represent novel treatment strategy provide mean deplete plasma cell within bone marrow ( 21,22 ) . Bortezomib approve use treatment multiple myeloma sensitivity myeloma cell proteasome inhibitor proportional immunoglobulin synthesis rate ( 22 ) . Plasma cell know high immunoglobulin synthesis rate treatment bortezomib deplete short long-lived plasma cell 60 % spleen 95 % bone marrow 48 hour treatment BALB/c mouse model . Bortezomib activate unfolded protein response ( UPR ) document increase expression chaperone BiP Chop marker UPR . The author also conclude late inhibition anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB also contribute cell death . In lupus nephritis mouse model ( NZB/W F1 mouse ) treat bortezomib , dsDNA-specific antibody decrease range non-autoimmune mouse . Total serum IgG , IgG2a , IgG3 , IgM , IgA concentration strongly reduce concentration IgG1 IgG2 alter slightly alter ( 21 ) . Total IgG concentration reduce 50 % . The author note newly form plasma cell could return 48 hour bortezomib injection . These finding support conclusion bortezomib kill plasma cell , salutary clinical effect , memory B cell deplete plasma cell quickly recover produce unwanted antibody . The ability bortezomib kill non-malignant plasma cell represent major find potential therapeutic efficacy transplantation autoimmune disease , incapable long lasting reduction antibody . The clinical finding variable reduction antibody level bortezomib explain finding basic science literature . Bortezomib use rescue strategy treatment refractory antibody mediate rejection ( 23-25 ) . An vitro study reveal bortezomib able induce apoptosis plasma cell aspirate renal transplant recipient whereas rATG , rituximab IVIG fail cause apoptosis ( 25 ) . Treatment bortezomib concentration block antibody production vitro show significantly decrease 20S proteasome chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity . Two patient bone marrow biopsy acute humoral rejection , one week bortezomib one year later reveal total number plasma cell allospecificities decrease total percentage plasma cell ( 25 ) . Not antibody reduce bortezomib two patient total IgG level unchanged , yet study show bortezomib could decrease plasma cell bone marrow . Bortezomib indicate multiple myeloma wherein malignant plasma cell aggressive produce antibody . The productive myeloma cell line make antibody , susceptible proteasome inhibition ( 22 ) . The literature non-malignant plasma cell also reveal susceptible proteasome inhibition bortezomib , number study , certain immunoglobulin fraction decrease overall amount immunoglobulin unchanged . Perhaps plasma cell metabolically active malignant counterpart . There evidence plasma cell may able decrease immunoglobulin synthesis turn would make less susceptible proteasomal inhibition ( 26 ) . A reexamination immunoglobulin homeostasis reveal potential therapy increase sensitivity bortezomib . Immunoglobulin homeostasis largely felt result plasma cell production FcRn mediate recycle endothelial cell . Antibody combine FcRn endosome endothelial cell degrade antibody combine recycle back interstitial space ( 27 ) . The concept IgG negative feedback loop plasma cell support data experimental animal human ( 28,29 ) . However , clinician observe patient `` rebound '' plasmapheresis level antibody high high plasmapheresis lead conclusion negative feedback loop ( 30,31 ) . The rebound phenomenon explain away return antibody periphery increase recycle FcRn receptor ( 28 ) . The regulation protein synthesis plasma cell receive new attention control complex system feedback loop involve endoplasmic reticulum stress mTOR signal ( 32 ) . Recent investigation mechanism IVIG function offer insight possible explanation negative feedback loop plasma cell . IVIG clinical literature think work number pathway include anti-idiotypic antibody , inhibition cytokine gene activation , anti-T cell receptor activity , anti CD4 activity , stimulation cytokine receptor antagonist , inhibition complement activity Fc mediate interaction antigen present cell block T cell activation ( 33 ) . Recent work reveals mechanisms possibly erroneous . Studies child ITP 1993 reveal infusion Fc fragment provide anti-inflammatory property ( 34 ) . The anti-inflammatory property IVIG attribute Fc sialylation IgG ( 35-37 ) . Immunoglobulins glycoprotein single N-linked glycan find Asn297 Fc domain . This covalently link complex glycan compose biantennary heptapolysaccharide contain N-acetylglucosamine mannose two terminal sialic acid residue ( 35 ) . Further modification carbohydrate structure common 30 different glycans identify one site glycosylation IgG mandatory FcγR binding . The total anti-inflammatory activity IVIG depend sialylation IgG Fc fragment represent 5 % IgG pool . The small amount sialylated IgG IVIG explain large dos require anti-inflammatory effect much low dos require treat hypogammaglobulinemia . Plasmapheresis , decrease sialylated IgG , may lead up-regulation antibody synthesis plasma cell make susceptible bortezomib . The index patient treat protocol similar one , patient effective deletion ( &lt; 5000MFI ) antibody detect LABScreen , include Class II antibodies prior difficult remove . Using much stringent criterion &lt; 1000 MFI , index patient one remain antibody 1000 end 3 cycle bortezomib treatment phase . The patient unique amongst case report therapy antibody mediated rejection desensitization therapy patient 's antibody dramatically decline total amount soluble antibody decrease point patient require IVIG replacement therapy . If result reproducible protocol sufficient safety , result could important ramification field transplantation autoimmune disease . Autoantibody mediate disease may potential cure immunologic memory incite epitope erase . It impossible study medication usual one-drug-at-a-time methodology give redundant nature immunologic memory . The potential risk protocol acceptable need develop effective therapy life-threatening situation . This protocol line criterion elucidate FDA recent New England Journal Medicine article , `` Development Novel Combination Therapies '' ( 38 ) . The article mainly describe combination therapy cancer trial ; however , thematic component document apply IND 110875 .</detailed_description>
