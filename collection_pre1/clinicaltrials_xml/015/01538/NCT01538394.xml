	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Efficacy Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seven first-line pharmacotherapies currently available recommend clinical practice guideline treat tobacco dependence , proven effective increase tobacco abstinence rate use monotherapy . However , smoker able quit monotherapy . Some smoker may benefit combination therapy include simultaneous use different nicotine replacement therapy ( NRTs ) medication different mechanism action ( e.g . NRT bupropion ) . Combination therapy different drug may provide therapeutic advantage increase serum nicotine concentration , may capitalize synergy obtain two different mechanism action . This controversy exist regard approach cost effectiveness approach clearly demonstrate neither genetic profile determine different treatment response . Data varenicline pharmacokinetic study document among smoker instruct quit continue smoke treatment , varenicline associate 60-80 % reduction number cigarette , hand , diminution plasmatic nicotine cotinine concentration . ( See study trial Background Information ) . This , lead hypothesis : ) varenicline saturate completely acetylcholinergic receptor incomplete response ; b ) varenicline replace incompletely dopaminergic effect smoking , continuous craving . The investigator consider smoker may need NRT addition varenicline reduce withdrawal craving smoke . Finally , available data suggest combination therapy may increase abstinence rate compare monotherapy [ OR : 2.4 ( 2.1- 2.7 ) ] without significant increase adverse event . So periodicity , regimen/dose , period combine treatment may consider safe monotherapy even off-label indication .</detailed_description>
