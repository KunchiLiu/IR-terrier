	<brief_title>Trebananib Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors , Including Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) trebananib ( AMG 386 ) administer weekly intravenous infusion child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . To determine tolerability solid tumor MTD and/or RP2D AMG 386 child central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . III . To define describe toxicity AMG 386 administered schedule . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics immunogenicity AMG 386 child refractory cancer . V. To measure change vascular permeability relative baseline , evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perfusion , follow AMG 386 administration pediatric patient CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity AMG 386 within confines Phase 1 study . II . To measure biologic marker angiogenesis potential correlation disease response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ( part 1 ) follow safety imaging study ( part 2 ) . Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
