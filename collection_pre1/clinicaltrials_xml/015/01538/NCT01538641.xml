	<brief_summary>Study Proposal : Other drug synergy Gemcitabine observe Cisplatinum , Taxol , Taxotere , Etoposide alkylating agent . However view Oxaliplatin 's superior activity single agent lymphoma , combination Gemcitabine Oxaliplatin attractive explore group disorder . Based data consider advantage favorable toxicity profile , propose phase II study patient either refractory relapse aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma include peripheral T-cell lymphoma know poor outcome compare equivalent aggressive B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
