	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different therapy actinic keratoses organ transplant recipient regard efficacy tolerability . The investiagtors plan examine treatment Imiquimod 5 % cream versus treatment Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16 % cream subsequent irradiation red light , so-called photodynamic therapy , patient ' group . A secondary objective study investigate reduction field cancerisation treatment use fluorescence diagnostic method digital imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imiquimod Versus Photodynamic Therapy Actinic Keratoses Organ Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Organ transplant patient ( OTP ) require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy consequently prone develop skin tumor , i.e skin cancer frequent malignancy organ transplant recipient . OTP frequently develop extensive area actinic damage , epidermal dysplasia , wich account increase risk aggressive skin cancer development susceptible patient , refer `` field cancerisation '' . Therefore whole area field cancerisation treat . In study treat area two different method single visible lesion actinic keratoses.In open prospective randomize intraindividual study one half patient ' scalp face treat Imiquimod 5 % cream 4 week , 3 time week , half Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16 % cream photodynamic therapy , two application two week interval . The pre- post treatment extension field cancerisation assess mean highly sensitive digital fluorescence imaging system .</detailed_description>
