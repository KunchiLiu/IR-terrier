	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-escalating Phase I study ON 01910.Na patient advanced cancer , satisfied inclusion/exclusion criterion enumerate protocol . Patients receive ON 01910.Na intravenously 24 hour continuous infusion every week ( 3 week per cycle ) , evidence disease progression , intolerable adverse event , withdrawal patient consent . Safety monitor do least 3 week escalation next dose level . As Amendment 7 , 6 patient gynecological malignancy enrol 2400 mg/m2 dose level determine appropriateness dose Recommended Phase Two Dose ( RPTD ) .</detailed_description>
