	<brief_title>Molecular Markers Neuroplasticity During Exercise People With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) know promote cell survival , improve synaptic function , induce neuronal morphological change . Consequently , BDNF play major role neuroplasticity ability central nervous system adapt recover follow injury . Regardless molecular mechanism occurs ( poorly understood ) , potentiate expression BDNF follow spinal cord injury show improve functional outcome animal . ( 1 , 2 ) It well document animal human literature production BDNF increase physical exercise healthy population individual chronic disease disability . ( 3 ) The literature suggest increase proportional intensity exercise , though parameter exercise maximize effect poorly understood . ( 2 , 4-6 ) From animal research , postulate serotonin ( 5HT ) play role mechanism increase BDNF expression , ( 7-9 ) finding specifically demonstrate potentiation exercise-induced expression antidepressant treatment ( 10 ) blunt response monoaminergic signal block . ( 11 ) A specific genetic variation BDNF gene , find approximately 30 % population also note important factor proper release BDNF associate deficit motor learning . ( 12 , 13 ) Initial evidence also suggest polymorphism may impact relationship exercise BDNF . ( 14 , 15 ) The objective study evaluate response serum concentration brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( [ BDNF ] ) acute bout exercise ambulatory people incomplete spinal cord injury ; additionally , examine effect pharmacological agent alter serotonergic ( 5HT ) transmission exercise-induced change [ BDNF ] s. To achieve objective investigate [ BDNF ] treadmill test alone combination two commonly used medication ; escitalopram oxalate , selective-5HT reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) cyproheptadine ( CYPRO ) , 5HT antagonist . Studies also show relationship BDNF mood , particular , depression . A secondary study perform parallel primary study purpose examine mood correlate molecular marker neuroplasticity individual participate repeat exercise state intervention . As subject progress course study time mood may change may impact relationship BDNF primary intervention .</detailed_description>

Women pregnant consider become pregnant exclude due trunk pelvis restraint require use locomotion , secondary unknown effect pharmacological agent develop fetus Exhibiting symptom suggestive depression accord Personal health Questionaire ( PHQ9 ) Subjects exhibit hemoglobin level consistent anemia ( &lt; 13g/dL men &lt; 12g/dL woman ) exclude study . Currently take prescribe antidepressant medication , include specific monoaminergic agent , precursor agonist , antipsychotic , medication know prolong QT interval , medication know interaction SSRIs . All subject exclude participation unless attend physician patient agree cease medication evaluation train period . A 14day washout period SSRIs 72 hour washout Tizanidine utilized . Subjects financially responsible physician visit necessary wean medication . Completion appropriate safe weaning confirm patient ' physician . Currently take prescribe antispastic medication . Specific agent exclude include baclofen ( Lioresal® ) benzodiazepine ( Diazepam® ) . Selected agent use pain modulation evaluate per subject ascertain potential interaction test agent . All subject exclude participation unless attend physician patient agree cease medication evaluation train period . A 72hour minimum washout period medication utilized .
