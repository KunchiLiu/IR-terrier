	<brief_summary>Recent advance understand biology genetics renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) lead major therapeutic implication . Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene inactivation , present majority sporadic form RCC , lead defective VHL protein , follow active transcription hypoxia-inducible gene , include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , c-kit , others . However , concept VHL inactivation RCC subsequent malignant phenotype almost exclusively see patient clear cell histology . The data efficacy VEGF receptor inhibitor non-clear cell RCC ( NCRCC ) rare . Recently , however , sunitinib sorafenib show worth NCRCC extend access programs.1-3 Although certain , underlying mechanism action might lie papillary , chromophobe , sarcomatoid type overexpress c-kit , also target drug could therefore provide therapeutic target non-clear cell subtypes.4-7 Pazopanib also potent selective , orally available , small molecule inhibitor VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , PDGF-α , PDGF-β , c-kit tyrosine kinase . It validate licensed advanced clear cell RCC ( CCRCC ) .8 However , data efficacy NCRCC . In study , try evaluate efficacy pazopanib metastatic NCRCC .</brief_summary>
