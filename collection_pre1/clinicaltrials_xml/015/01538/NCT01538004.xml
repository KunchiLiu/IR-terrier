	<brief_summary>The use automate blood pressure measurement ( ABPM ) device office set increasingly recognize superior manual BP measurement . Current guideline recommend patient alone quiet room , interaction health care professional reading ; practice , mean use exam room . However , find evidence support location ABPM . Furthermore , exam room constantly use primary care office , may practical routine care . For study , fifty consecutive consenting patient age 18 seven community base primary care office randomly allocate either ABPM exam room , non-private area clinic . After test first location test second location device . The main outcome mean value last five systolic blood pressure location within office . Secondary measure include blood pressure patient without hypertension , comparison initial second set blood pressure effect office noise decibel BP reading . New technology readily adopt barrier use minimize . If find difference BP reading office location , clinician option use additional office area implement automate BP measurement device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following design pilot study , patient consent two set blood pressure reading randomly allocate use random number table either automate blood pressure measurement use BpTRU device exam room ( private area without traffic staff ) door close , BpTRU open ( non-private area ) clinic routine office traffic noise level . Patients randomized private area first subsequently test non-private area randomize non-private area first test private area . A single portable BpTRU machine use recording . A research assistant train use equipment least five supervised training reading . The BpTRU device place patient 's arm reading record research assistant . The first reading do research assistant present ensure proper placement recording . The patient leave alone subsequent five measurement separate one minute interval . This immediately followed second set reading alternate location . During set reading patient seat comfortably chair arm instruct talk cross leg . The arm use set measurement blood pressure cuff heart level . The research assistant record average last five six blood pressure reading office location , accordance manufacturer 's recommendation previous study . The research assistant record decibel level location BP reading use Reed Sound Level Meter C-322 ( Reed Instruments , Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue , Quebec , Canada ) . The sound level meter include data logger , mean decibel level per location set reading record . The assistant train use sound meter logger use five supervised BP training reading . The research assistant also measure record patient 's weight kg , height cm , collect information patient 's gender self report history hypertension . Planned sample size analysis Our sample size base equivalence BpTRU measurement do non private office area compare measurement do private office area , use result pilot study . We consider difference le 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure clinically equivalent . In order demonstrate equivalence primary outcome , account cluster effect primary care office , use power 80 % two side alpha level 0.05 conclude equivalency difference 5 mm Hg le , need recruit 350 patient . Our planned recruitment therefore fifty patient per office seven office location . 175 patient ( 25 per office location ) randomly allocate BpTRU measurement private exam room first 175 allocate open area first . Following analytic method use pilot study , use random effect regression model account repeat measure within participant analyze data . Regression analysis undertaken compare measure result adjust cluster effect . All test two-sided use alpha level 0.05 .</detailed_description>
