	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Needling Versus Ultrasound Guided Corticosteroid Injection Alone , Randomized Controlled Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcifying tendinitis shoulder common cause shoulder pain incidence range 2.7 % 6.8 % . This disease rotator cuff tendon characterise calcification tendon , commonly supraspinatus tendon 82 % . The aetiology remain unclear . Calcifying tendinitis regard self-healing condition usually spontaneous resolution calcification . But patient chronic recurrent pain disability shoulder require treatment . The treatment minimally invasive effective short long term . Symptomatic treatment indicate first use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , therapeutic exercise non ultrasound guide subacromial corticosteroid injection . The role corticosteroid injection unknown due lack good study . Family doctor orthopaedic surgeon inject corticosteroid shoulder without guidance ultrasound ; method accurate needle placement subacromial bursa possible . When treatment fail therapeutical method use . Ultrasound guide needle percutaneous technique fragmentation extraction calcification rotator cuff tendon . Literature show favourable result randomize controlled trial execute . Randomised controlled trial need give insight effectiveness u guide needle . Comparing two group patient treat u guide corticosteroid injection one group combine u guide needle provide information usefulness u guide needling .</detailed_description>
