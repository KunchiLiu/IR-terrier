	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Afatinib Window Study Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , multicenter early phase II trial explore pre-operative activity afatinib vs. nontreatment . The study include early monitoring surgical co-morbidities patient treat afatinib accrual may stop prematurely accord pre-defined safety stopping rule . Patients randomize 5:1 ratio , two arm : afatinib 'no treatment ' . It intend include total 30 eligible patient 25 patient randomize afatinib arm . Patients allocate 'no treatment ' arm mainly serve reference interpret result translational research part study although formal comparison afatinib arm 'no treatment ' arm intend . Patients first register EORTC system sign informed consent form . The site complete study relate procedure within 4 week prior randomization eligibility criterion meet patient randomize study . The registration patient proceed slots patient open close base randomization patient afatinib arm . Starting 3 free slot , additional slot become available patient randomize 'no treatment ' arm . Registration pause three completes 4 week observation period surgery . Similar action do next 3 patient enter afatinib arm . Once first 6 patient afatinib arm observe surgical toxicity grade ≥ 3 4 week follow surgery , slot system cease operate .</detailed_description>

In general , decision appropriate method prevent pregnancy determine discussion investigator study subject . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Females breast feed . Post menopause define : amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause woman irregular menstrual period hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . Women child bear potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start investigational product . Female patient within one year enter menopause must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception treatment period least 6 month last study treatment . Males must agree use effective method contraception treatment period least 6 month last study treatment .
