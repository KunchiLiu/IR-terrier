	<brief_title>Safety ON 01910.Na 3-day Infusion Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-center , dose-escalating Phase I study determine Dose-Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RPTD ) ON 01910.Na ( rigosertib sodium ) administer 3 day continuous intravenous ( CIV ) infusion every 2 week ( 2-week cycle ) 28 patient advanced cancer ( 12 16 dose escalation phase 12 additional patient dose confirmation phase ) . The dose rigosertib base body surface area ( BSA ) , start dose 50 mg/m2/24 hour 3 consecutive day . In absence toxicity least 3-week observation period , rigosertib dos escalate follow Fibonacci scheme initial accelerate dose-escalation phase 1-patient cohort receive rigosertib 3 week drug-related Grade 2 toxicity ( accord Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] v.3 ) , exclude alopecia , occur , time 2 additional patient add subsequent cohort . If none 3 patient cohort experience DLTs , dose escalate half-Fibonacci step . If DLT see first patient cohort , dose go back half-step . The next dose level occur DLT report 3 patient 1 DLT occur expand cohort 6 patient . If DLT see 1 3 patient , 3 additional patient enrol cohort . If DLTs see 2 6 patient cohort , dose escalation stop . Once maximum administer dose ( MAD ) attain RPTD determine , dose escalation phase consider complete . Up 12 additional patient histologically confirm malignant tumor test RPTD dose confirm appropriateness . Secondary objective determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity rigosertib administer fashion ; investigate clinical pharmacology rigosertib administer fashion , include plasma pharmacokinetics dose level ; confirm appropriateness RPTD ; document observe antitumor activity rigosertib ; , evaluate biological effect rigosertib biomarkers serum and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</detailed_description>
