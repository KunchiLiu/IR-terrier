	<detailed_description>15,000 Americans die suddenly year rupture aneurysm aorta , ninth lead cause death men age 55 . Aortic aneurysms four time common men woman usually occur age 50 . Approximately one percent men age 55 64 significant aneurysm , likelihood increase four six percent men age 75 . In recent population-based study Medicare beneficiary , 83.2 % patient undergoing endovascular repair aortic aneurysm male . Furthermore , 11.9 % patient 67 69 year age , 26.8 % 70 74 , 35.7 % 75 79 , 15.8 % 80 84 9.8 % &gt; 85 year age . Ninety-six percent patient White , 3 % Black rest either Hispanic `` Other '' . We reason believe current population patient Pacific Northwest harbor abdominal aortic aneurysm match statistic . Thus , woman minority definitely under-represented study primarily due epidemiology disease process . Our institution treat large number patient aortic pathology include large number patient symptomatic rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm . We recently publish result implementation protocol manage patient endovascular technique able reduce mortality rate half first time 30 year . Unfortunately , patient present symptomatic rupture aortic aneurysm candidate endovascular repair . Reasons exclusion predominantly involve lack suitable proximal aortic neck . Solutions problem involve multi-branched `` fenestrated '' endografts assess clinical trial . However , grafts trial require 6 12 week manufacture deliver investigational site . On-site physician modification also describe currently consider outside Instructions For Use intend device . Our institution 's quality improvement department recently perform objective review 47 consecutive PMEG case patient present asymptomatic , symptomatic rupture aortic aneurysm highly encouraging result ( See Many patient region access clinical trial involve emerge aortic endovascular therapy , option due urgent presentation poor open surgical candidacy . For important reason , seek evaluate safety efficacy PMEG use FDA-approved , off-the-shelf device order increase applicability technologies patient thus save life .</detailed_description>
