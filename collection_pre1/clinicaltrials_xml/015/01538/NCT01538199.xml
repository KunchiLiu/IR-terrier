	<brief_summary>The purpose study see use Transcranial LED Therapy ( TLT ) use PhotoMedex 's Omnilux NEw-U LED help improve symptom major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . TLT work briefly deliver near-infrared ( non-visible ) radiation forehead . The radiation penetrate brain stimulate cell &amp; metabolism . Our goal - To assess antidepressant effect TLT depress subject . - To assess safety tolerability TLT depress subject - To assess acceptability TLT depress subject - To pilot test impact cognition TLT depress subject ( Ancillary Study )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TLT previously evaluate two large study people stroke . To date , TLT administer 550 people stroke . TLT also use 10 people MDD take part research study . During study , TLT show relieve MDD symptom without cause many side effect . The -Infrared Radiation ( NIR ) device also market wrinkle treatment , however experimental use depression . An experimental device mean one approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . During study , investigator hope good find NIR TLT helpful treat depression . The investigator compare effect TLT ( `` active treatment '' ) NIR device sham treatment ( inactive `` pretend '' treatment ) device . The sham ( `` pretend '' ) device look exactly like NIR device use near-infrared radiation study visit . There two set identical device use study , produce active sham treatment , respectively . The device work exactly receive active treatment sham treatment , except device produce therapeutic transcranial LED energy active treatment session produce LED energy sham treatment session . The investigator hope enroll 30 subject study Massachusetts General Hospital Depression Clinical Research Program .</detailed_description>
