	<brief_summary>The investigator study use advance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique measure blood flow brain tumor . This technique use radioactive tracer , provide high quality image obtain standard MRI scanner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Flow MRI Monitoring Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal : 1 . To compare blood flow measure technique measure tumor blood vessel density piece tumor surgically remove normal part clinical treatment . This confirm relationship image measurement microscopic characteristic tumor . 2 . To compare blood flow tumor therapy concentration choline , indicator cell proliferation . This choline concentration measure another MRI technique . This information demonstrate relationship cell proliferation blood supply also determine whether choline measurement add additional information clinically necessary . 3 . To determine reproducibility blood flow measurement tumor . This necessary good understand sensitivity technique change flow cause treatment change tumor vascularity . 4 . To monitor change blood flow initial treatment . Since sometimes tumor reappear , repeat measure help determine useful new imaging technique detect recur tumor .</detailed_description>
