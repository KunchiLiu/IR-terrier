To take part study , need opioid analgesia must indicate treat physician addition patient meeting study criterion . The patient randomize one two treatment arm . Prior receive either study medication ( ketamine ) active control ( morphine ) patient ask rate pain numeric rating scale ( NRS ) 0 pain 10 bad pain possible . Their baseline vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate oxygen saturation ) also document . These vital sign NRS reassess 5 , 10 20 minute post medication dosage . At 20 minute also document Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) score ask patient require additional pain medication . If patient denies need second dose medication continue re-assessed every 20 minute ( vital sign , NRS , RASS ) either inpatient admission , discharge home , transfer operating room total 120 minute initial dosing . If time study patient require second dose pain medication , follow administration med , assess vital sign 5,10 20 minute dose . At 20 minute , RASS score NRS score also document . They re-assessed every 20 minute ( vital sign , NRS , RASS ) either inpatient admission , discharge home , transfer operating room total 120 minute initial dosing . If require third dose pain medication time study , consider treatment failure treat physician contact provide pain control . The second phase study observational .
