	<detailed_description>Overview Systemic Sclerosis Scleroderma , also know systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , multisystem disease affect skin , variably , tissue , commonly include joint , muscle , lung , gastrointestinal tract kidney . It one group diseases fibrosis associate organ dysfunction . Fibrosis involve liver ( Lefton et al. , 2009 ; Pinzani et al. , 2005 ) , lung ( Frankel Schwarz , 2009 ) , kidney ( Schnaper , 2005 ) , less commonly organ , represent final common pathway organ dysfunction . In SSc tissue fibrosis widespread , variably involve skin , lungs gastrointestinal tract . Although SSc affect almost part body , skin disease consistent clinical manifestation . Skin disease typically start hand edematous phase hand swell last one several month . The skin progressively thicken tether underlie tissue . In diffuse cutaneous SSc ( dcSSc ) , skin thickening , induration tether typically extend proximally arm involve torso , abdomen , face leg . Patients limit cutaneous SSc ( lcSSc ) skin disease limit elbow face neck well characteristic clinical feature . SSc skin pathology ( diffuse limit cutaneous SSc ) show fibrosis variable perivascular lymphocyte infiltration deep reticular dermis . SSc affect multiple body system . Most severe complication see frequently dcSSc considerable morbidity mortality ( Steen Medsger , 2000 ) . Lung disease manifest interstitial fibrosis pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH , common lcSSc ) . Lung disease remain leading cause death among SSc patient . Gastrointestinal disease primarily result dysmotility . In esophagus stomach commonly lead esophagitis . In small large bowel commonly lead constipation , bowel obstruction and/or malnutrition . Renal disease primarily manifest accelerated hypertension renal insufficiency . Angiotension convert enzyme inhibitor generally though uniformly effective treating manifestation , previously lead significant mortality . Other important clinical manifestation include cold-induced vasospastic disease extremity ( Raynaud 's phenomenon ) digital ulcer . SSc also cardiac manifestation . Pericarditis frequent cardiac manifestation . Subclinical pericarditis common large effusion develop occasionally . Myocardial involvement low-grade myocardial fibrosis relatively common , frequently clinical importance ( Follansbee et al. , 1985 ) . Fibrosis commonly manifest appearance septal infarction pattern EKG patient normal coronary artery , ventricular conduction delay . Occasionally myocardial fibrosis lead heart failure . Cardiac arrhythmia see ~5 % patient SSc . Most common atrial ventricular ectopy , generally associate serious rhythm disturbance . However , thallium perfusion defect associate sudden cardiac death ( Steen et al. , 1996 ) . Current treatment SSc limit ( Steen , 2001 ) . For disease manifestation treatment primarily symptomatic generally inadequate . The exception renal disease , scleroderma renal crisis , major cause mortality SSc patient , often treat successfully angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor . Pulmonary complication represent major cause mortality . Cyclophosphamide provide benefit patient interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , lethal complication SSc . However , effect agent SSc-associated ILD modest transient ( Tashkin et al. , 2006 ; Tashkin et al. , 2007 ) . Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) also lead considerable mortality SSc patient . PAH may respond vasodilator epoprostanol bosentan , frequently responses incomplete mortality still high ( Badesch et al. , 2009 ) . Bowel hypomotility also lead considerable morbidity sometimes mortality . Esophageal hypomotility treat , frequently without success , pro-motility acid-blocking agent . Dysmotility low bowel complication even difficult treat pro-motility agent provide modest relief patient antibiotic help case small bowel overgrowth . Thus limited therapeutic alternative SSc patient face progressive lung bowel disease . Skin fibrosis , hallmark feature SSc remain without effective treatment . Although skin change SSc cause mortality , cause considerable morbidity , may reflect similar pathological process occur bowel lung , correlate highly prognosis disease progression organ system , reproducibly assess skin score testing . Skin disease particular interest evaluation clinical trial since easily biopsied thus repeatedly assessed pathological change clinical trial ( Lafyatis et al. , 2009 ) . Part difficulty find effective treatment SSc continue uncertainty regard initiate pathogenesis . The cause disease manifestation SSc remain obscure , although three major pathophysiologic explanation advance . Prominent pathologic change dermal pulmonary tissue show fibrosis , suggest abnormality matrix deposition . Vascular disease , result scleroderma renal crisis , digital ischemia pulmonary hypertension suggest dysfunction vascular endothelium . Autoantibodies SSc patient serum suggest immune dysfunction autoimmunity may contribute cause disease . The different pathological feature different organ provide support mechanism , clarify important overall pathogenesis . Background : IL-1 Rationale block IL-1 Systemic Sclerosis : The inflammasome fibrosis Several observation implicate IL-1 fibrotic disease SSc . Environmental occupational exposure silica dust lead fibrosis ( Cohen et al. , 2008 ) associate SSc ( Rustin et al. , 1990 ) . Recently , several group show murine model silica dust activates inflammation fibrosis inflammasome ( Cassel et al. , 2008 ; Hornung et al. , 2008 ) . Activation inflammasome also contribute bleomycin-induced lung injury ( Gasse et al. , 2007 ) . Rilonacept block IL-1β signal act soluble decoy receptor bind IL-1β prevents interaction cell surface receptor . Rilonacept also bind IL-1α IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) reduce affinity . Rationale Rilonacept In This Study SSc present special problem develop therapy due heterogeneous clinical presentation , variability disease progression difficulty quantify extent disease . The variability disease progression present particular challenge decide treat , leading overtreatment patient well misinterpretation open label trial . This heterogeneity disease progression also require recruitment relatively large patient number clinical trial , many skin disease go stabilize improve spontaneously ( Amjadi et al. , 2009 ) . Purpose/Objectives This study utilize 4-gene biomarker skin disease primary efficacy outcome short duration , placebo-controlled clinical trial rilonacept , design provide preliminary data large trial . The change 4-gene SSc biomarker skin score day 0 day 42 last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) measure rilanocept-treated patient well placebo patient score compare . These gene biomarkers provide strong surrogate trial future , IL-1 indeed cytokine lead fibrosis disease , provide highly significant start find therapeutic SSc first time might dramatically affect fibrosis . A central hypothesis study IL-1 inhibition downregulate 4-gene biomarker relatively short period time , much short historically think necessary see change MRSS . Entry criterion include recent onset dcSSc population likely show progressive skin disease also population examine previous study show correlation MRSS 4-gene biomarker . Secondary outcome include validated measure SSc disease activity . MRSS , SSc health assessment questionnaire ( SHAQ ) , include health assessment questionnaire ( HAQ ) SSc specific , patient visual analogue scale ( VAS ) organ specific involvement follow trial . Several study suggest SHAQ accurately measure disease activity may detect small change health status . This study also test effect rilonacept global skin gene expression use microarray analysis skin biopsy . In addition , serum biomarkers SSc disease activity ( COMP , THS-1 IFI44 ) biomarker inflammasome activation ( CRP ) test treatment . The change MRSS score , SHAQ score , skin myofibroblast score , gene expression , CRP serum biomarkers day 0 day 52 compare rilanocept-treated patient placebo-treated patient .</detailed_description>
