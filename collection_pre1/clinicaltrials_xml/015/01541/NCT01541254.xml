	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety probable benefit Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support ( LVIS™ LVIS™ Jr. ) device MicroVention , Inc. use facilitate endovascular coiling unruptured wide-neck intracranial aneurysm bare platinum embolization coil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study LVIS™ ( Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support ) Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With stent-assisted technique treat wide neck intracranial aneurysm , neurovascular stent place across aneurysm neck , act bridge prevent coil protrude parent artery . Stenting may allow safely achieve high pack density coil . These effect may improve rate complete aneurysm occlusion enhance durability coil treatment.The LVIS™ device manufacture MicroVention , Inc. braid design may provide superior conformability parent artery apposition , well reliable continuous uniform neck bridge neurovascular stent .</detailed_description>
