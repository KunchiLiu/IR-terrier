	<brief_summary>Patients require use artificial ventilation ( also call mechanical ventilation ) 21 day account 37 % ICU cost . As , patient transfer center specialize wean patient respirator ; unit refer long-term acute care ( LTAC ) facility . Despite increase LTAC facility , research fast method disconnect patient respirator lack . In addition , little information available regard long-term survival quality life prolong course artificial ventilation . The purpose study determine fast method disconnect patient respirator LTAC facility effect long-term survival quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weaning From Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation ( defined 21 day ) account 37 % ICU cost . As , patient transfer center specialize wean mechanical ventilation , call long-term acute care ( LTAC ) facility . Despite proliferation LTAC facility , research method expedite wean lack . In addition , little information available regard long-term survival patient 's perception quality life prolong course mechanical ventilation . In patient receive mechanical ventilation ICU , randomize trial reveal ventilator duration significantly influence wean method . The two common wean method pressure support spontaneous breathing trial . Unlike ICU , relative efficacy two technique wean patient require prolonged ventilation LTAC facility largely unknown . The aim proposal determine whether length time require wean prolonged ventilation differs pressure support versus spontaneous breathing trial . The second aim determine long-term impact prolong ventilation survival , functional status quality life .</detailed_description>
