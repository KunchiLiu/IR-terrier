	<brief_summary>The broad objective improve zinc status old infant young child risk zinc deficiency combination inadequate dietary zinc intake high rate diarrhea . As sub-study within large RCT use zinc fortify Sprinkles , propose study measure amount zinc absorb test meal typical unfortified complementary food consume Pakistani infant , complementary food fortify addition Zn-containing Sprinkle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exchangeable Zinc Pool Size Zn Absorption From Sprinkles Traditional Foods Pakistani Infants /Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In nest study aim measure subgroup recruit child main study , amount zinc absorb typical unfortified complementary food consume Pakistani infant , compare complementary food fortify addition Zn-containing Sprinkles multi vitamin . Since EZP Exchangeable Zinc Pool consider gold standard estimation actual concentration zinc plasma readily available cellular function , would also calculate EZP subset sample . The specific aim nest study : 1 . Determine absorption zinc ( Zn ) test meal consist typical local food addition multiple-micronutrient Sprinkles product containing ( 10 mg Zn ) v absorption meal without zinc supplementation micronutrient fortification . 2 . Compare size exchangeable Zn pool ( EZP ) subject randomized receive multi-micronutrient Sprinkle ( MN ) randomize ( MN+Zn ) control group . 3 . Children follow growth monitoring least 2 year . 4 . Plasma zinc phytates level wean diet also assess .</detailed_description>
