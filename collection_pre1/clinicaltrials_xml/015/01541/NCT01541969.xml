	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether new device deliver sound-based intervention ( term acoustic coordinated reset neuromodulation ) significant clinical benefit people intrusive tinnitus . It hypothesise particular pattern sound stimulation deliver device act break pattern synchronous nerve fire brain may responsible sensation tinnitus . We also measure brain activity subset participant determine intervention result change brainwave activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tinnitus affect large number people UK population poorly understood disorder form treatment benefit everyone . One theory tinnitus cause altered pattern synchronous nerve firing brain hear centre . It believe condition hear loss lead change area brain responsible hearing 'wired ' cause large area brain fire time ; believe mechanism responsible sensation tinnitus . Research suggest type synchronous activity may interrupt present specific sequence sound ears several month . If sound stimulation use break pattern synchronous activity hearing brain , argue also effective treat tinnitus . The German company ANM patent specific algorithm sound simulation deliver via headphone pocket-sized device . This treatment currently market private healthcare sector Germany recently UK . The purpose study independently test effect new therapy tinnitus severity relate brain activity . We gather information use questionnaire listen test , make record electrical brain activity use electroencephalography ( EEG ) .</detailed_description>
