	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate procedural safety effectiveness Phoenix Atherectomy™ System treatment de novo restenotic atherosclerotic lesion locate native peripheral artery . The Phoenix Atherectomy™ System intend use atherectomy peripheral vasculature . The intended peripheral vessel include Superficial Femoral , Popliteal , Infrapopliteal artery . The system intend use coronary , carotid , iliac renal vasculature . The result study used support 510 ( k ) submission Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>
