	<detailed_description>Protein turnover cyclic process net loss protein fast state net gain fed state contribute nitrogen balance . These physiologic process impacted infection ; whole-body protein catabolism exceed protein synthesis , result net loss whole-body protein . Patients urea cycle disorder suffer episode periodic hyperammonemic crisis , often association intercurrent infection . The immediate cause decompensation increase endogenous protein catabolism endpoint cascade trigger intercurrent illness . This increase protein catabolism lead elevation serum amino acid ammonia production , eliminate dysfunctional urea cycle . It well know infectious illness play significant role precipitate metabolic crisis urea cycle defect , presumably trigger cascade event involve release inflammatory cytokine lead increase protein catabolism . Cytokines also implicate distant mediator oxidative stress . However , correlation oxidative stress , cytokine level , severity crisis currently unclear . The primary purpose propose study characterize oxidative stress inflammatory cytokine status UCD baseline decompensated state . The investigator undertake measurement select marker oxidative stress cytokine serum urine baseline decompensated state subject UCD order establish prognostic value biomarkers disease severity and/or predictor metabolic decompensation .</detailed_description>
