	<detailed_description>Purpose : To identify biomarkers subset autism patient , design protein base assay system screen serum biomarkers confirm serum antibody still present one year 's time . Rationale : Autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , increasingly important public health concern . Estimates prevalence ASDs range 1/500 1/150 child . Retrospective data point immune dysfunction child increase frequency familial autoimmune history ( FAH ) report child autism . Behavioral response immune modulate therapy , though uncontrolled study , indicate role autoimmunity pathogenesis . Preliminary prospective work suggest immune etiology autism base high frequency brain endothelial antibody ( BEA ) child language regression , 2/3 autistic spectrum autism without language regression . Follow study small number patient show persistence BEA least year . The specific nervous system epitopes identify . Population : Approximately 15 child clinically diagnose autism first degree relative ( parent , brother , sister , child ) autoimmune disorder list questionnaire . Children autism spectrum without autoimmune history sibling match control without ASD Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative ( SFARI ) deidentified data SFARI database match age , sex ethnicity . Plasma sample psychometric data database provide database analysis laboratory Dr. Reiter . Design : The investigator seek identify protein biomarkers serum child carefully characterize autism familial autoimmune history first degree relative ( FAH ) . Cognitive defect mouse model autism spectrum disorder tuberous sclerosis complex ameliorate rapamycin , immune suppressant drug indicate likelihood auto-immunity play role autism pathogenesis . To expedite identification biomarkers investigator use proteomic profiling Drosophila melanogaster . The Drosophila ( fly ) nervous system highly homologous human molecular level genetic pathway synaptic development function highly conserve . Several human neurogenetic disease include Huntington , Alzheimer , fragile X , spinal cerebellar ataxia Parkinson disease successfully study use fly genetic model . Monoclonal antibody generate total fly brain homogenate cross react human neuronal tissue highly specific recognition particular subset neuron human nervous system . Our goal identify biomarkers group autism patient , design protein base assay system screen serum biomarkers confirm serum antibody persistent . A similar approach take Dr. Levin identify central nervous system ( CNS ) autoantigen human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 disease associate myelopathy/tropical spastic . Dr. Reiter 's group currently use proteomic profile Drosophila identify protein target Angelman syndrome gene , UBE3A .</detailed_description>
