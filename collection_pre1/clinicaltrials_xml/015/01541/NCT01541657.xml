	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect 3 type sensory-targeted rehabilitation intervention subjective objective measure function chronic ankle instability . If potential participant deem eligible participation consent participate , he/she undergo pretest session balance , gait , range motion assess . The participant randomize one 4 treatment group undergo first treatment take approximately 5 minute . After completion first treatment , participant immediately retested balance , gait , range motion measure . Upon completion test first day , participant treatment group ask return 5 treatment course 2 week . Upon completion treatment , participant test balance , gait , range motion . Then , 1 month , participant contact self-reported function follow-up visit he/she ask report stable functional his/her ankle past month .</detailed_description>
