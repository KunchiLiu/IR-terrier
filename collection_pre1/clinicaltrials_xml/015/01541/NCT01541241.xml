	<detailed_description>Intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUD ) one frequently use method birth control around world . IUD induce irregular uterine bleed one main problem many woman use method . In first year insertion IUDs , 5 15 % woman IUDs remove bleeding . The use IUD unfortunately associate functional failure one hand , medical complication hand . Despite increase use intrauterine device , dissemination limit high expulsion rate withdrawal use medical reason , mainly bleed pain . Following insertion modern copper IUD , menstrual blood loss increase 55 % , level bleeding continue duration IUD use . These change occur rapidly , iron supplementation recommend . There several possible mechanism explain cause excessive bleeding patient use IUD . Several study report IUD insertion increase production prostaglandins endometrium cause increase vascularity , vascular permeability , inhibit platelet activity therefore increase menstrual bleeding . Recent study report IUD cause cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) expression , subsequent elevate prostanoid biosynthesis signal promote expression pro-angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , angioprotein-1 ( Ang-1 ) angioprotein-2 ( Ang-2 ) down-regulate expression anti-angiogenic gene cathepsin-D . There several mechanism explain association pulsatility index ( PI ) resistance index ( RI ) uterine artery menstrual blood loss . It suggest menorrhagia , may cause increased uterine secretion prostanoids lead impaired haemostasis . Temporary post-insertion rise prostaglandin concentration coincide phase increase bleed pain . There expression mRNA protein COX-2 enzyme lead overproduction prostaglandin endometrium insertion copper intrauterine device ( CIUD ) . Other vasoactive substance may also involve , include nitric oxide ( NO ) potent vasodilator produce vascular endothelium . NO present human endometrium myometrium . There evidence NO may play part acute chronic inflammation . The introduction intrauterine device uterine cavity induces foreign body reaction surround endometrium . NO present foreign body inflammatory reaction around loosen joint replacement implant . Thus , possible IUD also induce NO synthesis surround tissue . There also connection NO synthesis prostaglandin synthesis . NO directly interact COX , responsible prostaglandin synthesis cause increase enzymatic activity . There also possible mechanism explain association PI uterine artery menstrual blood loss . Women menorrhagia show significant increase endothelial cell proliferation , reflect disturb angiogenesis . It possible also vascular abnormality result disturbed angiogenesis . In abnormal vessel , poor contractibility dysfunction haemostatic system may cause menorrhagia decrease impedance . The expression VEGF receptor , kinase insert domain-containing receptor ( KDR ) microvessel density ( MVD ) increase endometrium use CIUD . Based finding , uterine artery Doppler indices RI , PI widely investigate order identify uterine hemodynamic change patient IUD induce bleeding . The protocol study approve local ethic committee , informed consent obtain patient . Every woman subject follow : - Complete history take include age , parity , duration CIUD use , time insertion CIUD , history contraception method insertion CIUD , menstrual history CIUD insertion include duration amount menstrual flow , regularity length cycle , history drug intake , blood disease medical disorder consider . - Clinical examination include general , abdominal , pelvic examination . - Ultrasound examination do .After instruct patient empty bladder , transvaginal ultrasound do woman supine position leg semi-flexed abducted allow easy manipulation vaginal probe different angle application push-pull technique . A couple gel apply vaginal probe introduce rubber glove another layer couple gel apply glove . The probe introduce vagina systematic scanning . Ultrasound examination do cycle day 2-5 unless continual bleeding , use 7.5 MHz transvaginal transducer color Doppler facility . All ultrasound measurement measure 9:00 11:00 eliminate diurnal variation . The uterus ovary first visualize use conventional B-mode ultrasound check uterine size , dimension wall , presence uterine mass accurate placement device inside uterus . Blood flow index uterine artery calculate obtain pulsatility index ( PI ) resistance index ( RI ) accord follow equation : PI = ( A - B ) /mean , RI = ( A - B ) /A , A peak systolic , B end-diastolic Doppler shift , mean maximum Doppler shift frequency take cardiac cycle . The mean PI RI calculate combine three waveform leave right uterine artery use subsequent statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
