	<brief_summary>It show intravenous fatty acid give normal volunteer form heparin lipid emulsion cause insulin resistance matter hour . It known phenomenon demonstrate oral fat . The investigator specifically interested whether difference induction insulin resistance 3 main class fatty acid ( saturate , monounsaturated polyunsaturated ) . The investigator also plan evaluate endothelial dysfunction blood pressure ; frequently accompany insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Class Dietary Fat Affect Insulin Resistance ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 Diabetes cardiovascular disease closely link . A common abnormality condition insulin resistance . The primary cause insulin resistance know . A significant question dietary component contribute development insulin resistance . Based epidemiologic data , seem type dietary fat significant contributor development insulin resistance . However , researcher argue main determinant total amount fat , composition . This study intend determine main type fat ( saturate , monounsaturated polyunsaturated ) ingest short time cause insulin resistance lean , healthy people . It demonstrate 6 hour intravenous fat infuse lean , healthy subject result insulin resistance , well blood pressure elevation endothelial dysfunction . Whether oral fat know . The question important debate whether type fat important quantity fat person 's daily diet . Settling debate enhance ability health care personnel determine optimal dietary recommendation . This study make use high fat diet consist vegetable oil high 3 main fatty acid plasma ( palmitate , oleate linoleate ) . Because large fat load cause intestinal discomfort , feed tube use bypass stomach . The 3 oil assign randomly follow base line study saline 2 week prior intervention . Our primary endpoint insulin resistance , measure euglycemic , hyperinsulinemic clamp . Secondary measure include change blood pressure vascular reactivity measure ultrasound brief occlusion forearm vessel . The change compare baseline 2 group .</detailed_description>
