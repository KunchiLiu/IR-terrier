	<brief_title>Evaluation Vascutek Hybrid Graft Use Replacement Aortic Arch Concomitant Treatment Aneurysm/Dissection Descending Aorta Frozen Elephant Trunk Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Vascutek Hybrid device design use frozen elephant trunk procedure . Each system comprise fully seal traditional prosthesis stented distal end . A minimum 10 maximum 30 patient aneurysmal disease ascend aorta , arch proximal descend aorta receive hybrid prosthesis implant without use delivery system minimum 10 patient maximum 20 patient implanted hybrid device use delivery system . The traditional prosthesis component representative current Gelweave™ product . It woven polyester graft , crimp maintain lumen gel coat ensure seal immediately . The stented section graft self-expanding endoprosthesis construct thin wall woven polyester Nitinol ring stent , attach fabric braid polyester suture . The delivery system central catheter comprise stainless steel braid , Isoplast-Pebax co-extrusion locally strengthen provide adequate guidewire lumen sufficient stiffness deploy device . The out sheath 24Fr extrude PTFE groove provide localise splitting deployment . The handle component mould K-Resin &amp; thermoplastic polyurethane fulfil functional requirement product . The compacted endoprosthesis place open aortic arch deploy leave stented section position inside descend aorta . The device release delivery system handle component remove leave full graft situ correctly position . This allow surgeon complete aortic arch repair require . The material endoprosthesis section , traditional prosthesis section Hybrid Device identical current Vascutek product ( Anaconda™ Stent Graft System - endoprosthesis ; Gelweave™ - standard vascular graft ) . All material use delivery system well establish medical application . The Vascutek Ltd . Hybrid Device produce use establish manufacture Quality Control methodologies ISO 9001 ISO 13485 certify system . The Hybrid Device provide sterile single use . The method sterilisation ethylene oxide .</detailed_description>
