	<brief_summary>Since clinical study available compare gold standard ( autogenous bone graft plus resorbable membrane ) promise combination xenogenic bone graft load rhBMP-2 combination collagen membrane localize ridge augmentation , present exploratory study design . The aim present study therefore test whether application xenogenic bone block load rhBMP-2 result clinically , radiographically histologically similar outcome gold standard ( autogenous bone block ) regeneration chronic ridge defect . The investigator expect difference bone quantity quality two method use test treatment user patient friendly accord patient perception/acceptance since second surgical site necessary well cause less complication .</brief_summary>
