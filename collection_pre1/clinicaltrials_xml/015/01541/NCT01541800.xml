	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs small molecule recently discover cell . They know responsible normal development cell disrupt contribute development cancer . Many previous study do evaluate expression microRNAs normal tissue well wide variety cancer . Recently , microRNAs tumor cell detect circulate blood patient cancer . This present novel opportunity use microRNAs blood early predictor cancer well marker response therapy . No previous study perform evaluate microRNAs blood cerebrospinal fluid patient childhood cancer . We propose feasibility study evaluate presence microRNAs blood cerebrospinal fluid patient central nervous system tumor , leukemia lymphoma currently chemotherapy undergo blood draw , lumbar puncture and/or reservoir tap routine clinical care . If 're able identify circulate microRNAs population pediatric patient , build upon data propose future study .</brief_summary>
