	<brief_summary>This research do pain significant problem patient variety medical problem follow surgery traumatic injury . Currently available pain medication may relieve type pain may relieve pain dos produce side effect potential complication . Although Remote Ischemic Preconditioning ( RIPC ) appear promising , remain several unanswered question work . This research trial help determine RIPC may activate body natural pain control system . The goal study see RIPC effect 1 ) small area skin expose small amount UV- B radiation ( mild sunburn ) , 2 ) acute thermal heat temperature apply skin , 3 ) sunburn-like sensation light touch put capsaicin cream ( active ingredient hot chili pepper ) skin . Remote ischemic precondition do inflate balloon ( similar blood pressure cuff ) leg block blood flow minute . The cuff deflate blood flow resume . The process repeat three time . This procedure cause body increase natural pain relief system may help decrease amount postsurgical pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study determine whether RIPC effect peripheral sensitization , central sensitization determine effect size since data regard presumed effect . These issue easily sort patient experience postoperative pain hypersensitivity , since surgery affect component . In order address purpose investigator examine , healthy volunteer , effect RIPC manipulation generate hypersensitivity exclusive peripheral mechanism ( ultraviolet B ( UV-B ) burn ) manipulation generate hypersensitivity exclusive central mechanism ( topical capsaicin ) . Understanding site RIPC reduce amplification pain injury useful determine would logically apply clinically guide preclinical mechanistic study .</detailed_description>
