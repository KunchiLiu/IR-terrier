	<brief_title>Study Chokeberry Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk Former Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 31 % Connecticut adult former smoker , may contribute high CVD risk state . Atherosclerosis , hallmark CVD , progressive life-long process . Chronic cigarette smoking increase atherosclerosis CVD risk . While smoke cessation may lower CVD risk , former smoker still high CVD risk . The mechanisms smoking accelerate atherosclerosis formation fully understood . This knowledge gap prevents development inform intervention reduce CVD risk former smoker . Previous work suggest smoke increase oxidative stress lead elevate CVD risk . Former smoker also decrease antioxidant marker vascular function circulation , suggest despite cessation , smoke linger adverse effect CVD protective mechanism . Chokeberry ( Aronia melanocarpa ) native Connecticut plant rich polyphenol antioxidant promise intervention reduce CVD risk former smoker . Chokeberries diverse polyphenols anthocyanins , proanthocyanidins , resveratrol , quercetin , chlorogenic acid . Chokeberry consumption improve dyslipidemia , inhibit inflammation , reduces oxidative stress human animal , could contribute prevention CVD former smoker . Therefore , central hypothesis dietary chokeberry polyphenols reduce CVD risk former smoker improve lipid profile inhibit inflammation oxidative stress . Our long-term goal define mechanism polyphenol antioxidant mitigate CVD risk . The overall goal project conduct randomize placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate cardio-protective effect dietary chokeberry polyphenols former smoker . Our objective determine 1 ) effect chokeberry polyphenols plasma cholesterol triglyceride level gene expression involve cholesterol metabolism ; 2 ) extent chokeberry improve antioxidant vascular function former smoker ; 3 ) association bioavailability chokeberry polyphenols change biomarkers CVD risk . Successful completion work result improve understanding role dietary berry polyphenols regulate lipid metabolism , inflammation oxidative stress . Thus , study important step develop dietary recommendation individual predispose CVD risk , particularly former smoker .</detailed_description>
