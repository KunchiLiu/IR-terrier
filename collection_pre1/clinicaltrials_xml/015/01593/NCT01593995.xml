	<brief_summary>Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosin kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI , Erlotinib ) demonstrate efficacy patient non-small cell lung cancer pancreatic cancer . But , use associate dermatologic reaction vary severity . Incidence Erlotinib related skin effect ( ERSE ) report ~75 % NSCLC pancreatic cancer phase III trial . Even though dermatologic reaction could surrogated marker , may cause dose modification . Also , could give significant physical psycho-social discomfort patient . However , still wide variety drug used- include , steroid , antibiotic , vitamin D without clear evidence base management recommendation . The role epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) extensively investigate normal pathological wound healing . It implicate keratinocyte migration , fibroblast function formation granulation tissue . The first growth factor isolate growth factor therapy progress clinical practice treatment wound . Therefore , investigator propose epidermal growth factor ointment apply patient Erlotinib related skin effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Erlotinib Advances knowledge tumor biology mechanism oncogenesis grant single several molecular target NSCLC treatment . Among target , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , HER1 , receive particular attention lung cancer treatment . EGFR transmembrane receptor find primarily cell epithelial origin . Autophosphorylation intracellular domain initiate cascade event lead cell proliferation . EGFR commonly express high level variety solid tumor implicate control cell survival , proliferation , metastasis angiogenesis . The main pharmacological strategy clinical development therapeutic inhibition EGFR monoclonal antibody antagonize ligand-receptor binding , small-molecules inhibit tyrosine kinase domain activation . The main EGFR inhibitor cetuximab , anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody , Erlotinib EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor . The key indication clinical use colorectal cancer head neck cancer cetuximab NSCLC Erlotinib . Erlotinib , quinazolin-4-amine , highly potent , orally available , reversible inhibitor EGFR tyrosine kinase . Erlotinib , phase III randomize placebo-controlled trial , proven prolong survival ( 6.7 month versus 4.7 month Erlotinib placebo respectively , p = 0.001 ) NSCLC patient first second line chemotherapy . The analysis quality life time deterioration patient report symptom show statistically clinically meaningful benefit patient randomize Erlotinib . Moreover , Erlotinib result active ( response rate 8.9 % ) safe ( 5 % patient discontinue treatment toxicity ) . Following trial , Erlotinib approve Food Drug Administration Committee Medicinal Products Human use chemotherapy-pretreated advanced NSCLC . Skin rash common side-effect HER1/EGFR inhibitor . EGF ointment Rash affect skin waist , common adverse event associate Erlotinib , generally develop within 7-10 day start treatment . Skin rash may spontaneously resolve reappear reversible follow drug discontinuation . However , develops , chronic side-effect distressing patient . The increase use EGFR-targeted agent specifically Erlotinib NSCLC treatment , simultaneously lack clinical trial topic , make rash management etiology investigation high priority . It report repeated treatment EGF increase epithelial cell proliferation dose dependent manner accelerate wound heal process , whereas single EGF treatment noticeable effect wound-healing rate . There many study aim develop topical formulation sustain stable pharmacological property recombinant human EGF ( rhEGF ) . And rh-EGF concentration 1 5 ug/g see ideal concentration achieve efficient result acute wound partial thickness defect .</detailed_description>
