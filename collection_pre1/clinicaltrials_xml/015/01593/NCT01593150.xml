	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia present 1 % population 60 year age reach 15 % 80 year . AF associate reduce quality life , increased morbidity , mortality health economic cost . Presentation AF differs substantially among patient range self-limiting short episode ( paroxysmal AF ) , longstanding episode ( persistent AF ) direct current ( DC ) cardioversion need , chronic atrial fibrillation . Treatment AF individually tailor accordance symptom , type AF thromboembolic risk . The standard treatment symptomatic persistent AF DC-cardioversion precede anticoagulant treatment Warfarin . According guideline DC-cardioversion perform anticoagulation treatment therapeutic range least 4 week . However introduction Pradaxa ( Dabigatran ) enable early DC cardioversion , reduce time cardioversion 3 week period . During anticoagulation treatment persistence AF contribute leave atrial remodeling increase inflammatory neurohumoral biomarkers . The prolonged duration AF remodeling leave atrium increase risk AF recurrence DC-cardioversion . Early cardioversion patient persistent AF possible precede transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) . The TEE guide DC- cardioversion , demonstrate ACUTE study , safe efficient alternative conventional treatment . This treatment regime routinely use clinical practice . The aim study compare early DC-cardioversion ( within 72 hour ) conventional treatment ( Pradaxa prior DC-cardioversion ) . 140 patient persistent AF randomize early cardioversion precede TEE accordance guideline conventional treatment Pradaxa 4 week prior DC-cardioversion . The investigator determine outcome two group regard : - Left atrial function size assess leave atrial strain , leave atrial ejection fraction leave atrial volume . - Inflammatory neurohumoral biomarkers include ANP , BNP , IL6 CRP . - Time recurrence AF ( AF document ECG Holter monitoring ) Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography , 12 lead ECG , biomarkers Holter monitor perform time randomization , 4 week , 3 month 6 month post DC-cardioversion .

	<detailed_description>Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia , present 1 % population 60 year age significantly high among old population , reach 15 % patient 80 year . Worldwide , proportion people age 60 year grow faster age group . This inevitably result increase prevalence AF overall population . This support fact incidence AF increase past two decade . Furthermore number disease associate high prevalence AF , ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , valvular heart disease , diabetes hypertension also expect increase prevalence due age population . This contribute increase incidence AF . Atrial fibrillation associate significant increase mortality , morbidity reduction quality life . The mechanism behind AF include proliferation fibroblast , enhance connective tissue deposition fibrosis , play important part structural remodeling leave atrium . The structural remodel lead electrical deterioration fundamental initiation AF . The persistence AF induce electrophysiological remodeling , shorten atrial refractoriness end persistence AF . The vicious cycle , reverse restoration sinus rhythm . The treatment available today range DC cardioversion , pharmacological rhythm rate control , radiofrequency ablation anticoagulation treatment . If rhythm control desire , cardioversion sinus rhythm achievable DC-cardioversion . If AF present less 48 hour DC-cardioversion perform without precaution . If AF present 48 hour , DC cardioversion precede anticoagulation treatment Warfarin minimum 4 week alternatively Pradaxa 3 week prior DC-cardioversion . Early cardioversion patient persistent AF &gt; 48 hour possible preceded transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) exclusion thrombus demonstrate ACUTE trial . Discrepancy result limitation early study lead inconclusive result . Tendencies favour early DC-cardioversion increase haemorrhages conventional treatment group underline need randomize study primary aim ass ' difference effect conventional vs. early DC-cardioversion treatment . To investigator knowledge randomise study assess effect early versus late DC-cardioversion patient persistent AF . Hypothesis : Early DC-cardioversion persistent AF improve leave atrial function remodeling , decrease inflammatory /neurohumoral marker increase time recurrence AF compare conventional treatment . Aims : 1 . To determine , difference function size leave atrium , prior post cardioversion compare early cardioversion conventional treatment group . The data comparison acquire echocardiographically . 2 . To determine , difference level inflammatory ( IL-6 &amp; CRP ) neurohumoral marker ( ANP &amp; BNP ) prior post cardioversion , compare early cardioversion conventional treatment group . 3 . To determine , difference time recurrence , ECG Holter verify AF , compare early cardioversion conventional treatment . Descriptive aim : 1 . To determine whether difference correlation leave atrial size function neurohumoral inflammatory biomarker level pre/post cardioversion , compare early cardioversion conventional treatment group . 2 . To determine , whether difference strain analyze TEE versus transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) image leave atrium , patient 's receive early cardioversion . Methods : Inclusion criterion Patients admit department cardiology OUH Svendborg Hospital refer outpatient clinic symptomatic persistent AF , duration 48 hour indication DC cardioversion . Atrial fibrillation must verify 12 lead ECG . All patient must 18 year age , must provide write informed consent prior inclusion . Exclusion criterion Reversible cause AF ( thyrotoxicosis , infection , pulmonary embolism ) , acute coronary syndrome absolute contraindication TEE ( oesophageal spasm , stricture , perforation diverticulum ) . Patients diminish mental capability include . Study design The patient undergo unblinded randomization two group PROBE design include blinded analysis echocardiography , Holter monitor biomarker result . Group one receive conventional treatment Pradaxa period minimum 3 week prior DC cardioversion . Group two undergo TEE follow early DC cardioversion within 72 hour . Post cardioversion treatment Pradaxa apply accord guideline minimum 4 week . Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography , 12 lead ECG , biomarkers Holter monitor perform time randomization , 4 week , 3 month 6 month post DC-cardioversion . Furthermore patient follow symptomatic AF recurrence period one year , AF recurrence document 12 lead ECG . Procedures : Transesophageal echocardiography Patients examine fast state , application topical pharyngeal anaesthesia . Left atrium leave atrial appendage view order exclude thrombus dynamic spontaneous echo contrast . Tissue Doppler 2D image leave atrium 0,30,60 90 degree acquire offline strain analysis . Transthoracic echocardiography Two dimensional image tissue doppler image ( TDI ) leave atrium leave ventricle acquire offline strain analysis . Standard evaluation systolic function ( EF , WMSI ) ; diastolic function ( E/a , DT , e ' , ' , atrial volume ) evaluation mitral aortic valve perform . Blinded offline strain analysis perform commercially available software . `` Time peak standard deviation '' ( TPSD ) reliable measurement overall leave atrial dyssynchrony , peak strain global atrial strain compute offline analysis . Blood specimen Will draw prior cardioversion 4 week post cardioversion . The blood sample store immediately collection - 80°C refrigerator . Neurohumoral inflammatory marker ( IL 6 , ANP , BNP , CRP , ect . ) analyze en bloc . Holter monitor /12 lead ECG 48 hour Holter monitoring 12 lead ECG take place 4 week , 3 month 6 month post cardioversion . A recurrence AF define AF period minimum 30 second Holter AF verify 12 lead ECG . Sample size Based previous study change peak strain follow DC cardioversion investigator expect mean change peak strain 5.8 control group . The investigator expect minimum relevant difference ( MIREDIF ) two group ½ standard deviation ( 4.05 % ) . With α 0.05 β 0.80 investigator must include minimum 63 patient treatment group . With expect dropout 10 % total sample size 140 patient include . A thorough review medical record period 01/01/2010 - 01/10/2010 show DC-cardioversions perform 121 time OUH , Svendborg Hospital period 10 month . Based number previous DC-cardioversions investigator expect inclusion period approximately 18 month . Data Analysis Outcome explanatory variable test normality transform appropriate . Univariate analyse change atrial strain neurohumeral response two group perform use unpaired t-test simple regression . Multivariate regression analysis use analyze significant covariates . Analysis repeat measure perform Mixed Model approach . Time recurrence analyse use log-rank test Cox Proportional Hazards Model . Ethical Considerations This clinical trial perform accordance ethical principle base Declaration Helsinki approve ethic comity . Prior inclusion patient receive thorough explanation trial nature ; participation base signing informed consent . The patient may , give time withdraw trial . The trial approve ethical scientific counsel . Furthermore patient group receive already establish approve treatment , patient therefore submit experimental treatment and/or risk treatment may present .</detailed_description>
