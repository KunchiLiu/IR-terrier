	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone Chinese subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Even though efficacy safety lenalidomide already well-demonstrated population include Asians , study ass efficacy safety well pharmacokinetics lenalidomide Chinese subject . In addition , study generate clinically meaningful information guide therapeutic use lenalidomide Chinese subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Low-Dose Dexamethasone Chinese Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , multicenter , single arm , open-label trial enroll Chinese subject China relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ass efficacy safety lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone regimen ( Rd ) give progressive disease ( PD ) discontinuation lenalidomide reason . There two cohort protocol , Pharmacokinetic Assessment Treatment Cohort Treatment Cohort without Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Assessment . The first 10 subject ≤ 75 year old baseline Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min participate pharmacokinetic assessment first 8 day Cycle 1 . During cohort , subject receive 25mg oral lenalidomide daily day 1 -21 28-day cycle . During first cycle cohort , subject also receive 40mg oral dexamethasone daily Days 8 , 15 , 22 ( dexamethasone day 1 ) . Beginning Cycle 2 , subject receive 25mg oral lenalidomide daily day 1 -21 28-day cycle 40mg oral dexamethasone daily Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle . Once 10 subject enrol PK Assessment Treatment Cohort , Treatment Cohort without PK Assessment begin . During cohort , subject receive lenalidomide 25 mg p.o . daily Days 1-21 dexamethasone 40 mg p.o . daily Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . In cohort , subject continue Rd therapy documentation PD discontinuation study therapy due reason include intolerable toxicity . For primary analysis , response assess accord European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation EBMT ( Bladé ) criteria Independent Response Adjudication Committee ( IRAC ) . Response also assess accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion use exploratory analysis .</detailed_description>
