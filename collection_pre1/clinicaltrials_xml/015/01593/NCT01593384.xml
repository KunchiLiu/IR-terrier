	<brief_summary>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) technology develop improve lesion detection dense breast woman . Even though DBT regard study dense breast woman , may also improve lesion detection earlier stage small size woman less dense breast tissue . The overlap tissue standard care 2D mammogram lead decrease cancer detection , also contribute pseudo lesion mimic cancer . This lead patient ask come back additional imaging include mammogram and/or ultrasound image . DBT show decrease call back rate 43 % reader study . Even though result promise do realistic clinical setting.The purpose study evaluate FDA-approved combination standard digital mammography ( DM ) DBT technology impact clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Chart-Review : Impact Combination - Digital Breast Tomosynthesis + Digital Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator would like prospectively measure impact recall rate , compare DM ( digital mammography ) DM+DBT , practice impact cancer detection screen population . This two-site study asymptomatic subject undergo FDA-approved combination standard care Digital Mammogram Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DM+DBT ) exam eligible trial . Each subject control.Only radiologists go 8 hour Tomosynthesis training interpret DM DBT image . These radiologist categorize case either dense ( BI-RADS density score 3 4 ) fatty ( BI-RADS density score 1 2 ) . The radiologist initially read standard care DM part study first record interpretation final BIRADs category . The radiologist interpret DM+DBT combination study record final interpretation BIRADs category . Prior mammogram study use comparison read DM DM+DBT study .</detailed_description>
