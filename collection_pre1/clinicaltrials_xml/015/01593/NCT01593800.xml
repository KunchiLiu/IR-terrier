	<brief_summary>Lactose intolerance ( LI ) , also know lactose malabsorption common type carbohydrate malabsorption . It associate inability digest lactose constituent , glucose galactose , due low level lactase enzyme activity ( 1-2 ) . At birth , lactase activity high decline wean ( 1-2 ) . The unabsorbed lactose metabolize colonic bacteria produce gas ( hydrogen ( H2 ) methane ( CH4 ) ) short chain fatty acid . Symptoms related LI appear 30 minute 2 hour consumption food product contain lactose . Related symptom include : bloating , cramp , flatulence loose stool ( 1-2 , 17-18 ) . Highest rate LI find Asian population , Native Americans African Americans ( 60-100 % ) , low rate find people northern European origin ( include northern Americans ) ( 3-4 ) . The diagnosis LI base patient ' symptom sometimes problematic , since symptom specific may differ one patient another . Breath hydrogen test advocate best diagnostic tool assessment LI ( 15-16 ) . During test , subject sample hydrogen level breath sample base line every 30 minute administration 50 gram oral lactose , total period 180 minute . A breath sample &gt; 20 ppm baseline consider positive LI ( 15-16 ) . There establish treatment LI , almost complete avoidance lactose rich dairy product . Avoidance dairy product major concern since outcome may result dietary calcium intake well recommend dose 1,000 mg per day men woman 1,300 mg adolescent ( 8-10 ) . For reason different course action need consider instead complete exclusion dairy product LI patient . Two possible intervention case LI supplement commercially available lactase ( tablet ) addition probiotic . The consumption lactase enzyme food supplement may assist restore adequate level enzyme need hydrolysis lactose , especially patient low , non existent level lactase . On hand , lactase product problematic since lactase preparation concentration . Moreover , difficult ass amount lactase tablet need order fully hydrolyze lactose dairy mill ( 14 ) . Probiotics live microorganism commonly use order prevent treat disease . The current definition Food Drug Administration World Health Organization `` Live microorganism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host . '' These microorganism heterogeneous group , nonpathogenic produce beta- galactosidase lactase intracellularly may assist digestion lactose ( 11 ) . Studies show people lactose intolerance tolerate lactose yogurt well amount lactose milk . The assumption presence lactase produce bacteria yogurt , especially Lactobacillus acidophilus , contribute digestion absorption lactose ( 5-6 , 13 ) . It also find presence Lactobacillus bulgaricus Streptococcus thermophilus alleviate lactose intolerance ability produce lactase enzyme ( 7 ) . Finally , another study find consumption milk contain Bifidobacterium longum result significantly less hydrogen production flatulence compare consumption control pasteurize milk ( 12 ) . Based mention data , investigator speculate administration probiotic may assist consumption dairy product contain lactose . Therefore , aim study evaluate effect probiotic patient LI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Probiotics Lactose Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>lactose hydrogen breath test ( LHBT ) perform base line visit ( total 7 breath sample patient ) . All subject present lactose hydrogen breath test 8 hour fast . At initial stage , subject take base reading time 0 . Subjects receive 50 g lactose dissolve 100 ml plain water perform breath test sample every 30 minute 3 h. All breath sample end-expiratory analyzed immediately Portable Breath Hydrogen Monitor ( Gastro+ gastrolyzer , Bedfont Instruments , Holywell Lane , Upchurch , Kent , England ) . The concentration breath hydrogen measure part per million ( ppm ) . The measurement plot graphically analyze . The effect probiotic LI treatment measure follow criterion : 1 . If hydrogen level measure 6 month treatment low level measure time 0 and/or patient report decrease symptom , treatment LI Probiotics consider successful . 2 . If hydrogen level measure 6 month treatment high level measure time 0 and/or patient report unchanged state increase symptom , treatment LI probiotic consider unsuccessful .</detailed_description>
