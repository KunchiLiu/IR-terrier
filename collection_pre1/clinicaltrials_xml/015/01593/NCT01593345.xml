The RCT component pilot recently discharge community dwell senior 70 year old . A sample 400 senior recently discharge adult , general , hospital site MUHC contact need assessment . From pool , investigator anticipate 100 eligible 60 randomize , 30 mentor intervention 30 control group . Participants followed-up 6 month assessment perform 2 time point ( baseline 6 month ) . The main outcome standardize response ratio ( SRR ) estimate across person measure . SRRs calculate three group response variable : impairment/mobility measure , quality life indicator , health service outcomes . In parallel , determine cancer survivor need , investigator contact 600 cancer survivor ; investigator anticipate 400 answer survey .
