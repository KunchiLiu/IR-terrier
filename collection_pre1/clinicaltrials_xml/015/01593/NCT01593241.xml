	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1 . Disease background Testicular cancer common malignancy men age 18-35 year . Of , seminoma frequent account half testicular cancer . Seminoma classify accord involvement degree spread lymph node lung organ . Around 10 % seminoma patient diagnose stage IIA/B disease . Stage IIA patient one enlarge regional lymph node , 2 cm less great dimension , without evidence distant disease ( cN1 cM0 ) . Stage IIB patient one enlarge regional lymph node 2 cm 5 cm great dimension , without evidence distant disease ( cN2 cM0 ) . Paraaortic , interaortocaval , para-/pre-/retrocaval pre-/retroaortic lymph node consider regional . Intrapelvic , external iliac inguinal lymph node consider regional scrotal inguinal surgery . Seminoma stage IIA/B highly responsive chemotherapy radiation therapy progression free survival 5 6 year treatments 87-95 % . Supra-diaphragmatic lymph node usual site tumor recurrence radiation therapy , local failure tumor persistence paraaortic lymph node predominant chemotherapy . 2 . Therapy background Current standard therapy patient stage IIA/B seminoma involve either large volume paraaortic ipsilateral pelvic radiation therapy ( `` dogleg field '' ) three cycle chemotherapy BEP ( Bleomycin , Etoposide , Cisplatin ) . While treatment modality offer high rate progression free survival overall survival , also potentially bear risk unwanted event follow treatment . Large volume radiation therapy associate fatigue , nausea vomit treatment . BEP chemotherapy cause transient fatigue , cytopenia hair loss . In term late adverse event , radiotherapy increase risk permanent kidney bowel damage , BEP chemotherapy may harm kidney , lung , heart inner ear . Both therapy modality may also lead secondary tumor . Data late undesirable effect large field radiation therapy intensive chemotherapy become available future conclusion long term follow-up analysis recent trial . Thus , current research seminoma focus minimize short long term treatment-related morbidity . 3 . Previous trial Therapy de-escalation test proven effective stage I testicular seminoma patient . For many year , standard care patient paraaortic radiation therapy . The trial Oliver et al . demonstrate non-inferiority single dose carboplatin chemotherapy comparison paraaortic irradiation term tumor control patient stage I seminoma . Although trial present long term data demonstration low toxicity profile carboplatin compare paraaortic irradiation still lack , many clinician already switch treatment strategy carboplatin chemotherapy seminoma stage I patient , hope treatment produce less negative late effect radiation therapy . Based result , think similar therapy de-escalation approach could attractive patient stage II disease . 4 . Rationale perform trial Therapy de-escalation stage IIA/B seminoma recently test prospective phase II trial use 3 cycle ( stage IIA ) 4 cycle ( stage IIB ) carboplatin chemotherapy . However , regime actually consider acceptable treatment relapse rate 18 % three year . In trial , relapse patient experienced tumor recurrence lymph node initially involve within 3 year follow treatment . Thus , chemotherapy de-escalation carboplatin lead good systemic disease 's control , local control involve node remain problem . On hand , relapse occur initially involved lymph node seminoma IIA/B patient treat large volume irradiation , although 5 % patient develop distant relapse . Therefore , one possible way raise progression free survival involve lymph node area acceptable level therapy de-escalation protocol would combine suboptimal carboplatin chemotherapy ( 1 cycle ) limit volume radiation therapy target involve node ( 30 36 Gy stage IIA IIB , respectively ) . It expect combination trigger less side effect standard therapy . Previous trial demonstrate single agent carboplatin associate increase number adverse event 9 year post chemotherapy . The application small volume , involved node radiation therapy avoid damage viscera kidney . Furthermore , risk secondary malignancy likely reduce low-intensity chemotherapy dramatically shrunk irradiation field . This single arm trial , stage IIA IIB patient include , since current international treatment recommendation valid disease stage . Selecting exclusively one disease stage trial inclusion would greatly hamper feasibility trial . The trial design , trial treatment trial specific consensus among Swiss Urogenital Tumors Project Group , Swiss Radio-oncology Section German Testicular Cancer Study Group . If propose therapy scheme prof effective safe , provide significantly relevant treatment alternative large volume radiotherapy intense chemotherapy , may become new standard care patient seminoma stage IIA/B .</detailed_description>
