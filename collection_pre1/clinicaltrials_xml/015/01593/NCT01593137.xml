	<brief_summary>The process atherosclerosis multifactorial involve many mechanism . The majority publish work identify endothelial dysfunction first step cascade event culminate plaque formation . Among various mechanism occur follow attack vessel wall , thought stem cell form endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) endothelial protection mechanism . Factors identify cardiovascular risk factor , rather condition suppose threat vessel wall , therefore associate low level EPCs . To date link show hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidaemia , smoking . Furthermore , lack wall protection situation low level EPCs clearly biomarker cardiovascular morbidity mortality . On hand , correction risk factor allow recuperation EPCs therefore show promise tool measure therapeutic efficacy . The tool correct EPC level clearly define . The effect statins level EPC show , low level EPCs diabetes seem susceptible treatment statin . The role glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) slowly elucidate actual mechanism potential endothelial protection unknown , effect EPCs study . Liraglutide , long-acting GLP-1 analogue , could also interest option long-term vessel wall protection , date ability correct cardiovascular biomarkers EPCs study .</brief_summary>
