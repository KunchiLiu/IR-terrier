	<brief_summary>Background : - Although progress make treat child B-cell cancer leukemia lymphoma , many child respond standard treatment . One possible treatment involve collect white blood cell call T cell person cancer modify cell attack B-cell cancer . The cell give back participant . This study use T cell modify attack CD19 protein , find surface B-cell cancer . Objectives : - To see anti-CD19 modify white blood cell safe effective treatment child young adult advance B-cell cancer . Eligibility : - Children young adult 1 30 year age B-cell cancer ( leukemia lymphoma ) respond standard treatment . - The leukemia lymphoma must CD19 protein . - There must adequate organ function . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study bone marrow biopsy may perform depend type cancer . - Participants undergo process white blood cell collect , call apheresis . These cell modify contain anti-CD19 gene . - Participants 3 day chemotherapy prepare immune system accept modified cell . - Participants receive infusion modify white blood cell . They remain hospital recovered treatment . - Participants frequent follow-up visit monitor outcome treatment . - If participant benefit treatment , he/she may option another round treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) recognize CD19 antigen construct clinical trial several institution . In trial , POB utilize chimeric receptor contain signal domain CD28 CD3-zeta , currently study CCR adult , child young adult CD19 express malignancy . In co-cultures CD19-expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell , anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell show robust killing , xenograft model , rapidly clear CD19- express ALL cell line . Objectives : 1 . Primary : To determine safety feasibility administer escalate dos anti-CD19-CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte two stratum ( prior allogeneic stem cell transplant [ SCT ] vs. prior SCT ) child young adult B cell malignancy follow cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen . COMPLETED March 2014 . 2 . Primary : To determine safety administer cell two group child young adult B-cell malignancy express CD19 : - Arm 1 - Patients without high-burden disease patient chemotherapy toxicity concern receive standard preparative regimen . - Arm 2 - Patients high-burden disease receive standard chemotherapy reduce burden , ( define patient ALL M3 bone marrow blast and/or presence peripheral blood blast routine CBC , patient lymphoma ) . 3 . Primary : To determine feasibility administer anti-CD19 CAR transduce T cell within 21 day target date child young adult B-cell malignancy express CD19 enrol arm 2 : Patients high-burden disease receive standard chemotherapy reduce burden . 1 ) Secondary : 1 ) To determine administration anti-CD19-CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte mediate antitumor effect child B cell high-burden disease standard chemotherapy , patient without high-burden disease receive standard preparative regimen . 2 ) To evaluate ability CRS treatment algorithm reduce incidence Grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome ( CRS ) less equal 10 % patient . 3 ) To measure persistence adoptively-transferred anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell blood , bone marrow CSF patient . 4 ) To describe toxicity administration anti-CD19-CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte child young adult CNS disease . Eligibility : Patients 1-30 year age , least 15 kg , CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy recur respond one standard chemotherapy-containing regimen malignancy deem incurable standard therapy . Patients history allogeneic stem cell transplant meet eligibility criterion eligible participate . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis . Anti-CD19 CAR T cell manufacture fresh frozen PBMCs . On Day -7 , PBMC enrich CD3+ cell culture presence anti-CD3/-CD28 bead follow retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-CD19 CAR . Total culture time approximately 7-14 day . - Patients divide 2 group list . Arm 1 : Patients begin preparative regimen comprise fludarabine 25 mg/m ( 2 ) Days -4 , -3 -2 cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m ( 2 ) day -2 . Arm 2 : Patients high-disease burden treat intensive standard care chemotherapy decrease disease burden cell manufacturing . - All patient : The CD19-CAR cell infuse Day 0 , 72h delay allow fresh cell 21 day delay cell cryopreserved , need resolution clinical toxicity generate adequate cell number . - The previously determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 1 X 10 ( 6 ) administer intravenously . - Patients monitored toxicity , response T cell persistence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patient must CD19expressing B cell ALL lymphoma must relapse refractory disease least one standard chemotherapy one salvage regimen . In view PI primary oncologist , must available alternative curative therapy subject must either ineligible allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) , refuse SCT , disease activity prohibit SCT time . CD19 expression must detect great 15 % malignant cell immunohistochemistry great 30 % flow cytometry CLIA approve test Laboratory Pathology , CCR , NCI , NIH refer institution reference laboratory . The choice whether use flow cytometry immunohistochemistry determine easily available tissue sample patient . In general immunohistochemistry use lymph node biopsy , flow cytometry use peripheral blood bone marrow sample . Patients must measurable evaluable disease time enrollment , may include evidence disease include minimal residual disease detect flow cytometry , cytogenetics , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis . Greater equal 1 year age ( least 15 kg ) less equal 30 year age . Adequate absolute CD3 count estimate require obtain target cell dose base discussion DTM apheresis Cell Processing Section , DTM . Subjects follow CNS status eligible absence neurologic symptom suggestive CNS leukemia , cranial nerve palsy : CNS 1 , define absence blast cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) cytospin preparation , regardless number WBCs ; CNS 2 , define presence &lt; 5/uL WBCs CSF cytospin positive blast , &gt; 5/uL WBCs negative Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 marrow disease fail salvage systemic intensive IT chemotherapy ( therefore eligible radiation ) Patients isolated CNS relapse eligible previously treat cranial radiation ( least 1800 cGy ) . Ability give inform consent . For subject &lt; 18 year old legal guardian must give informed consent .
