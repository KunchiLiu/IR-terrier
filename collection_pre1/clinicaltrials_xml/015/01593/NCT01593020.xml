	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn well eribulin , give combination standard chemotherapy , treat early-stage breast cancer compare paclitaxel give combination standard chemotherapy . In study , standard chemotherapy give either 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ( call FEC ) 5-fluorouracil , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ( call FAC ) . Eribulin change version structure natural substance sea sponge . It design block cell divide , may cause cancer cell die . Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . 5-fluorouracil designed block cancer cell grow dividing , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Epirubicin design block way cancer cell grow divide , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Doxorubicin design stop growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth and/or keep spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign either group . If Group 1 , receive paclitaxel 4 cycle . You also treat FAC FEC 4 cycle . Your treat doctor decide whether receive FEC FAC . If Group 2 , receive eribulin 4 cycle . You also treat FAC FEC 4 cycle . Your treat doctor decide whether receive FEC FAC . Each cycle 21 day . Study Drug Administration Group 1 : You receive paclitaxel vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 21-day study cycle . Before infusion , give drug vein , help decrease risk allergic reaction . If severe side effect , future treatment may delay , dose may decrease , may take study . Once receive 4 cycle paclitaxel , receive either FEC FAC chemotherapy 4 cycle . Your treat doctor decide whether receive FEC FAC . Study Drug Administration Group 2 : You receive eribulin vein 2-5 minute Days 1 8 21-day study cycle . Once receive 4 cycle eribulin , receive FEC FAC chemotherapy 4 cycle . Your treat doctor decide whether receive FEC FAC . FEC FAC Treatment : After receive 4 cycle either paclitaxel eribulin , receive FEC FAC . If give FEC chemotherapy , receive 5-Fluorouracil vein 15 minute , epirubicin vein 30 minute , cyclophosphamide vein 30-60 minute Day 1 every 21-day cycle . If give FAC chemotherapy , receive 5-Fluorouracil vein 15 minute , doxorubicin vein 15 minute , cyclophosphamide vein 30-60 minute Day 1 21-day cycle . Before FEC FAC chemotherapy , give drug vein help decrease risk allergic reaction . These drug include dexamethasone zofran . Study Visits During Paclitaxel Eribulin : On Day 1 cycle : If test within 10 day Day 1 Cycle 1 , may need repeat . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1-4 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . At Week 12 , core biopsy . At end Cycle 4 : - You ultrasound breast check status disease . - You ECHO MUGA scan . - You core biopsy fine needle aspiration tumor . A small needle insert tumor safe easy location withdraw cancer cell . This use learn tumor marker may predict may best respond therapy . Study Visits During FEC FAC Chemotherapy : On Day 1 every third week : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . After finish FEC FAC treatment , may surgery . At end chemotherapy treatment , refer breast surgeon discus surgery . There small possibility ( le 3 % ) tumor gotten bad treatment , additional chemotherapy may necessary . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Paclitaxel , doxorubicin , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . Eribulin FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic breast cancer patient receive least 2 chemotherapy regimen treatment metastatic disease . The use eribulin FEC/FAC regimens investigational neoadjuvant treatment . Up 162 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
