	<detailed_description>EPIDEMIOLOGY Neisseria meningitidis globally important cause meningitis septicaemia . The polysaccharide capsule important virulence factor cause invasive disease . The serogroup meningococcal strain determine biochemical composition polysaccharide capsule . There 13 diverse polysaccharide capsule A , B , C , W Y commonly cause invasive infection . In particular serogroups A , C , W , &amp; Y account &gt; 70 % meningococcal disease North America , serogroups B &amp; C responsible vast majority disease Europe Serogroup A cause cyclical meningitis epidemic African meningitis belt , include recent outbreak 2009/2010 . Given rapid progression serious sequelae meningococcal disease , primary prevention vital effectively achieve vaccination . In absence serogroup B vaccine , quadrivalent vaccine serogroups ACW &amp; Y represent broad mechanism control meningococcal disease worldwide . Protection induce vaccine relies anti-capsular polysaccharide antibody . MENINGOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE AND CONJUGATE VACCINES Polysaccharide ACWY vaccine consist pure capsular polysaccharide four serogroups widespread use since late 1970 's . However , common polysaccharide vaccine encapsulate bacteria , meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine poorly immunogenic young child , provoke long lasting immune response [ 5 ] may reduce nasopharyngeal carriage . Newer conjugate vaccine consist capsular oligosaccharide chemically link protein carrier . Conjugation polysaccharide protein carrier allow recruitment cognate T cell help subsequent exposure antigen provoke potentiate antibody response immunological memory . This study aim investigate novel aspect B cell immune responses meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine . To achieve , administer quadrivalent ACWY polysaccharide vaccine ( MenACWY-PS ) , quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine ( MenACWY-CRM ) contain capsular oligosaccharide serogroups A , C , W-135 &amp; Y conjugate CRM197 mutant diphtheria toxoid carrier adult volunteer . Each vaccine contain different amount capsular antigen ( see Table 1 ) . The polysaccharide vaccine 50µg polysaccharide 4 serogroups , conjugate 10µg A 5µg C , W &amp; Y . A recent trial use MenACWY-PS MenACWY-CRM conduct Oxford Vaccine Group ( Understanding Immune Response Meningitis Vaccines , OXREC 09/H0606/20 , Eudract 2007-001349-17 ) show preliminary evidence difference B cell response polysaccharide conjugate meningococcal vaccine . However , confound factor interpret data trial difference amount capsular antigen contain two type vaccine use study . Full dose MenACWY-PS Polysaccharide vaccine 50µg MenA , MenC , MenW MenY capsular antigen . MenACWY-CRM Conjugate vaccine contain 10µg MenA capsular antigen 5µg MenC , MenW MenY . The current study design compare full dose MenACWY-PS 1/5th dose MenACWY-PS ( contain 10µg serogroup ) full dose MenACWY-CRM . This differentiate polysaccharide dose-dependent response true polysaccharide vaccine vs. conjugate vaccine response . In particular , aim investigate thymus dependent thymus independent nature immune response polysaccharide conjugate meningococcal vaccine respectively . THYMUS INDEPENDENT AND THYMUS DEPENDENT IMMUNE RESPONSES Thymus independent ( TI ) antigens defined ability induce immune response T-cell deficient athymic mouse . In common high molecular weight molecule repetitive structure , polysaccharide vaccine antigen classify Type 2 TI antigen . The repetitive polysaccharide epitopes cross-link BCR antigen specific B cell , trigger activation signal stimulate proliferation differentiation antibody-secreting plasma cell . The absence T cell help preclude generation memory B cell . TI responses think largely mediated marginal zone B cell ( MZB ) , mature marginal zone spleen . This compartment poorly developed child two year age , result ineffective anti-polysaccharide immune response age group . Murine study reveal important role subset mature B cell , B1b cell , adaptive immunity . Unlike development conventional B cell memory , require formation germinal centre T cell , development B1b cell-mediated long-lasting antibody response occur independently T cell- help . In contrast , conjugate vaccine act thymus dependent ( TD ) antigens . Binding polysaccharide moiety antigen specific B cell receptor allow uptake polysaccharide protein conjugate processing via classical MHC class II pathway . Peptides derive carrier protein present cognate CD4+ T helper cell , provide signal B cell differentiation . TD responses mediate follicular B cell ( FOB ) , generation antibody secrete plasma cell memory B cell , capable respond specific antigenic challenge [ 10 ] . Recent work conduct Oxford Vaccine Group suggest pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine induce B1b FOB cell , respectively . This study investigate whether also hold true meningococcal conjugate polysaccharide vaccine . This do analyse different population B cell produce response full dose polysaccharide vaccine , 1/5th polysaccharide vaccine conjugate vaccine use novel immunological technique develop laboratory . HYPORESPONSIVENESS Vaccine-induced hyporesponsiveness inability mount booster response least magnitude produce prim dose . Previous vaccination meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine show impair antibody responses subsequent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine . The design study allow investigation phenomenon polysaccharide induce hyporesponsiveness quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine level memory B cell plasma cell response . SEROGROUP A Unlike sialic acid base polysaccharide capsule serogroups B , C , W-135 &amp; Y , serogroup A meningococcal capsule compose N-acetyl mannosamine phosphate . Plain serogroup A polysaccharide vaccine show unexpected immunogenicity young infants.These result suggest perhaps due chemical structure , group A polysaccharide may handle immune system classic TI antigen . This study test hypothesis follicular B cell produce response serogroup A component MenACWY-PS , contrast , marginal zone B1b cell produce response serogroup C component vaccine . This study also test hypothesis follicular B cell produce response serogroups A C components MenACWY-CRM . ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE The human humoral response anticipatory ; potential specific antibody exist prior encounter extensive collection antigen encounter lifetime individual . The basis diverse repertoire multiple gene segment comprise variable region antibody molecule . The potential V D &amp; J segment combine randomly introduces combinatorial diversity repertoire . During rearrangement , nucleotide may add remove junction gene segment , term junctional diversity . Furthermore , maturation antibody response , somatic hypermutation variable region occur B cell proliferation germinal centre . This underlies increase antibody affinity secondary response antigen . These mechanism help create potential repertoire 1016 antibody molecule . Previous study show human humoral response specific antigen restrict diversity within individual across population limited number antibody encode variable region gene utilise . These study rely traditional vector clone Sanger sequence rearrange heavy chain loci single cell , limited scope analysis potential repertoire . Massive parallel sequence emulsion PCR powerful new tool enable large scale DNA sequence potential simultaneously sequence one million read per run . These technique apply look potential antibody repertoire zebrafish , human antibody repertoire specific B cell subset [ 20 ] ass clonality leukaemoid cell . This study aim compare VDJ repertoire memory B cell population polysaccharide conjugate ACWY vaccination . ANALYSIS OF GENETIC INFLUENCES ON THE IMMUNE RESPONSE A aspect assess study impact genetic factor response immunisation . Twin study several vaccine include measles , mumps rubella , show high heritability vaccine antibody response . Some genetic association already identify gene adaptive innate immune response vaccine , example human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) alleles measles antibody responses IL-1β polymorphism hepatitis B vaccine response . These study small scale base single candidate gene extent genetic variation contributes vaccine response remain poorly understood . Insight genetic variant affect response specific vaccine help identify critical immune pathway lead protection vaccination lead production effective vaccine . In addition , identification gene may play important role wild-type infection allow good understanding disease pathogenesis , turn may lead development novel therapy The blood sample obtain study provide source DNA contribute DNA bank pool sample multiple different Oxford Vaccine Group study . These DNA sample use genome wide analysis genetic factor influence host response vaccine receive relevant study . This DNA extraction storage occur specific consent participant , DNA analyse purpose assess factor influence immune response vaccine . Serum leave separation cellular plug DNA extraction also store immunological assay quantification functional antibody serum bactericidal activity may also perform . SUMMARY This study aim investigate detail aspect B cell response conjugate polysaccharide quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine healthy adult use variety novel laboratory method .</detailed_description>
