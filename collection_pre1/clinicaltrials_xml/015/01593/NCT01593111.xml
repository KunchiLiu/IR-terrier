	<brief_summary>Exposure household allergens major contributor asthma symptom . Aggressive measure reduce household allergens potential reduce asthma symptom need medication control asthma . The investigator plan enroll patient age 6 single blind , randomize study compare intensive environmental intervention usual asthma care 48 week study period . All subject asthma treatment optimize accord guideline base care . Subjects randomize aggressive environmental remediation arm versus distribution write material regard allergen reduction ( `` usual care '' ) . Primary outcome measure ability reduce asthma step therapy . Secondary outcome include measure lung function , asthma biomarkers quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research question ( ) : In individual atopic asthma treat inhaled corticosteroid without long act beta agonist ( 1 6 possible step treatment ) , aggressive environmental intervention reduce exposure home allergen likely lead one step reduction asthma controller therapy , improve asthma control improve biomarkers airway inflammation usual care . Scientific abstract : Environmental exposure indoor allergens major contributor asthma impairment risk , particularly among asthmatic patient reside inner city . The investigator plan randomize controlled trial ass effect individualize , comprehensive , multifaceted indoor allergen avoidance measure ability step asthma controller therapy adult child great 6 year mild severe persistent asthma . Specifically , 1 . To determine via randomize , control trial allergen sensitize asthma patient whether environmental intervention aim reduce exposure indoor allergens irritant effective reduce National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) step base therapy usual care 48 week study period . 2a . To determine environmental intervention lead reduction indoor allergen level , allergen specific serum IgE level , airway hyper-responsiveness , fractional excretion nitric oxide , asthma symptom score , asthma exacerbation , treatment failure improve lung function compare usual care 48 week study period . 2b . ( Exploratory ) : To determine association reduction allergen specific IgE level reduction NAEPP step level require asthma control among subject randomize environmental intervention compare usual care .</detailed_description>
