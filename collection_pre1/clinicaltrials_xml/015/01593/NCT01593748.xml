	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Comparing Gemcitabine Pazopanib Versus Gemcitabine Docetaxel Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test effectiveness safety Gemcitabine Pazopanib compare Gemcitabine Docetaxel participant soft tissue sarcoma . Screening test do ensure subject eligible participate study . If exams , test procedures show subject study , choose take part , `` randomize '' one two study group : Group 1 Group 2 . Subjects Group 1 receive Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously ( directly vein ) Day 1 Day 8 Pazopanib 800mg mouth daily . Subjects Group 2 receive Gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1 Day 8 Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously Day 8 . Both group 21 day cycle . Both group ask complete `` quality life '' questionnaire , first visit , 6 week ( 2nd cycle ) , 18 week ( 6th cycle ) end study treatment . Subjects follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
