	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy ultrasound image compare MRE ( Magnetic Resonance Enterography ) form magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) accurately diagnose follow Small Bowel Crohn Disease ( SBCD ) child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness MR Enterography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed Tomography ( CT ) image tool expose patient radiation , recently commonly use image method evaluate small bowel Crohn disease . Recently , Magnetic Resonance Enterography ( MRE ) form magnetic resonance image provide detailed image bowel less frequently , Ultrasound ( US ) replace CT standard care image tool institution . The investigator would like determine effective US imaging compare MRI image accurately diagnose follow SBCD child . Along enteric ultrasound ( EnUS ) also compare new ultrasound technology call Ultrasound Elastography Imaging ( UEI ) study use second form UEI call Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ( ARFI ) . This technique use sound wave asses stiffness property soft tissue . The study compare cost , patient preference , image accuracy .</detailed_description>
