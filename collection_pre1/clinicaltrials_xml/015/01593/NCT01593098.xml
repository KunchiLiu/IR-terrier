	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Into Risk Colorectal Neoplasms Individuals With Family History Advanced Adenomas ( Sibling AN Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence colorectal cancer ( CRC ) rise rapidly Hong Kong . It second common cancer Hong Kong 4000 new case diagnosed 2007 , also second commonest cause cancer death accounting approximately 1,700 death per year . It estimate 1 20 ( 5 % ) 1 33 ( 3 % ) Hong Kong male female , respectively , develop CRC life time . ( 1 ) Data Hong Kong cancer registry show almost half cancer case stage III IV disease diagnosis associate bad prognosis ( 1 ) , suggest early detection CRC important . Genetic factor play important role development CRC . Approximately one fifth CRC associate familial clustering ( 2 ) , whilst hereditary syndrome include hereditary non- polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) account approximately six percent CRC case ( 3 ; 4 ) Individuals family history CRC increase risk develop colonic neoplasm ( cancer adenoma ) . Meta-analyses epidemiological study show FDR patient CRC approximately two three-fold increase risk develop CRC compare general population ( 5-9 ) . [ Table 1 ] . The frequency adenoma ( 12-69 % ) also high relatives patient CRC although early data derive cohort study ( 10-16 ) . In recent two case-control study , choice control population questionable ( 17 ; 18 ) [ Table 2 ] . Our case-control study screen colonoscopy FDR CRC , compare FDR patient normal colonoscopy ( publish abstract form ) show prevalence colonic adenoma significantly high case compare control ( 25.3 % versus 15.6 % ) ( 19 ) . Colorectal adenomas precursor CRC , FDR individual colonic adenoma also increase risk CRC well colonic adenoma ( 20 ; 21 ) The risk develop colorectal neoplasia FDR patient adenoma likely influenced characteristic adenoma index case . Colonic adenoma high malignancy potential great 10mm size , / contains villous component severe dysplasia ( 22 ) . In one study , relative risk CRC FDR high relatives patient large adenoma ( &gt; 10mm ) small adenoma ( OR 2.1 1.2 respectively ) ( 23 ) . These finding reproduce recent study France , addition show risk particularly high index case young 60 year diagnosis large adenoma , male large adenoma leave colon ( 24 ) . In separate study , relatives patient advanced neoplasm ( OR1.62 ) , small tubular adenoma ( OR 1.26 ) , increase risk CRC ( 25 ) . Little known prevalence CRC adenoma among siblings individual advance neoplasm Hong Kong . Furthermore screening procedure relatives patient high risk adenomas well establish screen strategy relatives patient CRC . This information important relevance formulation effective CRC screening strategy Hong Kong ( 26 ) . In pilot screening project 2001 among asymptomatic subject great 50 year old , investigator demonstrate approximately 12 % rate advance neoplasm use colonoscopy tool . Since 2008 , asymptomatic subject great 50 year old invite undergo colonoscopy screen CRC PWH AHNH hospital . To date 1800 asymptomatic subject complete colonoscopy screening . This project provide investigator opportunity use original design determine prevalence colorectal neoplasia sibling patient advance neoplasm , compare sibling asymptomatic individual negative screen colonoscopy period time . The molecular pathway lead tumour development familial colorectal neoplasm likely different sporadic case . Development new molecular base method early detection , prevention treatment relies heavily understand difference sporadic familial neoplasm . Identification genetic mutation also improve genetic diagnosis screen protocol risk population . The investigator hypothesize sibling patient advanced neoplasm increase risk CRC adenoma . The investigator aim quantify risk , identify individual patient neoplasm characteristic may contribute increase risk . In addition , investigator aim determine molecular alteration profile colonic adenoma sibling patient advance neoplasm . Investigator 's preliminary data show rate advance adenoma control ( sibling normal colonoscopy ) 2 % . Earlier study show odds ratio colorectal neoplasm close relative subject adenomas varies 2.5 4.7 . Using conservative calculation , assume prevalence advance adenoma control 3 % estimate 2.5-fold increase risk advance adenomas sibling individual advance adenoma . Accordingly recruitment minimum 293 case 586 control require achieve 80 % power detect difference 5 % significance level . For project , investigator aim screen 300 sibling patient advance adenomas 600 matched control .</detailed_description>
