	<brief_summary>Background : - Loa loa small worm infects people West Central Africa . It spread bite fly . Adult worm live skin cause swell arm , leg , face . Some people serious infection heart , kidney , brain . Most people Loa loa infection symptom . The standard treatment Loa loa infection medicine call diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) . Some people bad reaction DEC , include itching , muscle pain , severe case coma death . - Another drug , ivermectin , use mass drug treatment program prevent spread worm infection cause blindness massive swelling ( elephantiasis ) . However , people also Loa loa serious bad reaction ivermectin . Researchers want study DEC ivermectin find reaction occur . If prevent , mass drug treatment program able used area Africa Loa loa exists . Objectives : - To study side effect DEC ivermectin treatment Loa loa infection . Eligibility : - Individuals live 4 village Cameroon Loa loa infection know exist , 20 60 year age , pregnant breastfeed low level Loa loa parasite blood , otherwise healthy . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect check Loa loa infection . Participants also eye exam provide skin sample check worm infection may interfere study treatment . - Participants admit hospital 4 day ( treatment ) . They receive single dose either DEC ivermectin . - After treatment , regular blood sample collect . Participants ask question feel treatment . Physical exam perform . If side effect develop , participant treat hospital . - After leave hospital , participant followup visit . These visit happen day 5 , 7 , 9 , 14 receiving study medicine . They involve short physical exam collection blood sample . - At end study , participant offer full 21-day DEC treatment cure Loa loa infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ivermectin currently use mass drug distribution control onchocerciasis elimination lymphatic filariasis Africa . Due occurrence severe neurologic adverse event individual concomitant Loa loa infection high level circulate microfilariae , drug distribution halt many area Cameroon , Democratic Republic Congo Loa-endemic country . Diethylcarbamazine citrate ( DEC ) treatment choice Loa loa infection United States non-endemic country , also associate development severe adverse reaction , include fatal encephalopathy , correlate number circulate microfilariae blood . The cause reaction unknown , know post-treatment reaction DEC ivermectin underlie mechanism . Post-treatment reaction medication accompany dramatic interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) -dependent increase eosinophilia evidence eosinophil activation . Preliminary data suggests , unlike post-treatment response Wolbachia-containing filariae , inflammatory mediator commonly see bacterial infection malaria , include tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha IL-1-beta , increase post-treatment DEC . The aim study characterize immunologic mechanism ivermectin DEC posttreatment reaction establish whether posttreatment reaction underlie mechanism . An understanding pathophysiology post-treatment reaction necessary order develop strategy prevent reaction future . We plan randomize 20 subject low- to- moderate number circulate Loa loa microfilariae receive single oral dose either ivermectin ( 200 mcg/kg ) DEC ( 8 mg/kg ) inpatient set Cameroon . Signs symptom , blood microfilarial level , complete blood count , intracellular serum cytokine level marker eosinophil activation assess baseline , 4 8 hour , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 14 day post-treatment compare two treatment group . Subjects receive ivermectin treat single dose DEC ( 8 mg/kg ) day 14 . All subject follow 6 12 month post-hospitalization determine whether experienced Loa-specific symptom ( eyeworm Calabar swelling ) . Mf count complete blood count ( CBC ) differential obtain follow-up visit . Subjects Loa-specific symptom mf count &gt; 100 mf/mL 6 month time point offer full treatment course . If &gt; 50 % subject meet criterion full DEC treatment 6 , month time point , subject treat study enter follow-up phase visit 12 month ( 6 month full treatment course ) .</detailed_description>
