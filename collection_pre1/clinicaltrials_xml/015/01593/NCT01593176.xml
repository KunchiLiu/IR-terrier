	<brief_summary>The investigator research study look distal femoral fracture ( knee bone break ) heal . In study , investigator use Radiostereometric Analysis ( RSA ) look piece femur bone move bone heals . RSA special x-ray us radiographs measure small movement bone time . The question answer study whether RSA use tool monitor fracture healing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiostereometric Analysis Fracture Healing Distal Femur Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determining fracture united difficult . Plain radiographs easy obtain notoriously inaccurate determine union . CT scan helpful , costly inconvenient . Artifacts metal implant often mask visibility bone structure . In addition , accuracy CT scan determine non-unions know . CT scan identify nonunion clear persistent fracture line separate fragment . Unfortunately , scan often reveal area bone bridged fracture , area fracture line remain . Ultimately , one know amount bridge necessary stop motion fragment . Often best indication fracture heal resolution pain . However , patient ' pain tolerance varies greatly . It clear specialty need well technique determine fracture union . This particularly important since market introduce many new drug purport increase rate fracture healing . If standard evaluate fracture healing , way determine drug efficacy . Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) highly accurate , precise , safe objective technique use radiographs measure small displacement relative motion time . It use successfully time evaluate small change position prosthetic joint . There indication technique also use evaluate healing determine motion fragment stop . A limited number phantom model RSA in-vitro study prove useful measure rigidity different type osteosyntheses method . However , RSA far apply in-vivo study evaluate fracture healing . Osteosynthesis distal femur fracture challenge . Fractures reduce large skin incision often patient face non-union union varus valgus deformity long convalescence . That say , increase fracture fixation achievable newly invent lock angle screw plate system . The Synthes product , Less Invasive Stabilization System ( LISS ) plate one example new system . The exact time fracture healing , however , remain uncertain . No RSA in-vivo study publish among patient distal femur fracture - one RSA in-vitro study 18 phantom distal femur demonstrate RSA relatively simple way collect analyze relative motion fragment fix LISS.8 Given , possible evaluate fragment motion distal femur fracture stabilize use LISS plate order evaluate healing . At time surgery , set 9 RSA bead implant side main fracture line use inserter instrument image intensifier . In AO/OTA type 33A fracture , two set implant - one femoral shaft one distal femoral epiphysis . In AO/OTA type 33C fracture extra fracture line epiphysis , three set implant - one femoral shaft , one main lateral condyle segment one main medial condyle segment . No bead plant comminuted bone fragment . Patients evaluated outpatient follow-up visit standard fracture ( 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 1 year surgery . ) The purpose study use RSA evaluate fracture heal distal femoral fracture osteosynthezed use LISS .</detailed_description>
