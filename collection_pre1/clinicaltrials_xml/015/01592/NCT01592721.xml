	<brief_summary>The incorporation novel target therapy radiation therapy particular interest head neck cancer may improve efficacy without significantly increase toxicity . The investigator hypothesize addition second EGFR-targeted agent inhibits EGFR intracellular level improve antitumor effect standard radiation cetuximab . The goal study evaluate safety , efficacy , biologic effect patient locally advance SCCHN antisense gene target EGFR combination standard therapy radiation cetuximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Cetuximab Plus Intratumoral EGFR Antisense DNA Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) highly express SCCHN overexpression associate poor patient outcome . EGFR promise target anticancer therapy . The investigator develop EGFR antisense DNA safe potentially efficacious treatment SCCHN show previous phase I study conduct University Pittsburgh . Cetuximab ( Erbitux C225 ) chimerized EGFR monoclonal antibody produce positive result phase III trial SCCHN add radiation therapy approve FDA treatment locally advance SCCHN . Radiation plus cetuximab consider standard treatment , especially patient good candidate chemotherapy . In current study , investigator plan evaluate addition intratumoral EGFR antisense DNA ( EGFR AS ) standard radiation concurrent cetuximab patient . Objectives - To evaluate safety combination intratumoral EGFS AS DNA standard cetuximab radiation . - To evaluate locoregional progression-free survival select patient locally advance SCCHN treat intratumoral EGFR AS DNA combine standard radiation plus cetuximab . - To evaluate efficacy parameter , include objective response rate , distant control overall progression-free survival , overall survival . - To determine effect EGFR antisense therapy EGFR-related biomarkers . The investigator use reverse phase protein microarrays ( RPPA ) immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis tissue microarrays ( TMA ) baseline post-treatment tumor tissue determine expression level modulation panel EGFR EGFR-pathway related biomarkers , include ( necessarily limit ) EGFR , pEGFR , Src , pMAPK , STAT3 , pSTAT3 , pSTAT5 , pSTAT1 , pAKT , p38 , p21 , p27 , PARP , E-cadherin , p-ErbB3 , Ki67 . - To examine transfection EGFR antisense gene therapy vivo . Subject population The investigator enroll patient SCCHN suitable intratumoral injection EGFR antisense . Treatment plan EGFR AS administer direct intratumoral injection use direct visualization , endoscopy , imaging-guidance ( ultrasound ) clinically determine ( see protocol ) . Patients receive total 4 weekly intratumoral injection EGFR antisense ( less identifiable tumor ) start 2 week prior radiation ( study schema protocol ) . Patients receive standard radiation 70 Gy/200 cGy/daily , 5 days/week , concurrent cetuximab 250 mg/m2 , load dose 400 mg/m2 2 week prior start radiation . Statistical Design Sample Size The study conduct two-stages . In first stage , 11 patient stage IVA-C recurrent disease evaluate safety . If regimen deem safe , total 31 patient stage III IVA-B , previously untreated SCCHN enrol second stage study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>First stage Patients AJCC 7th edition stage IVAIVC recurrent metastatic head neck cancer eligible . Patients M1 disease must asymptomatic low volume distant metastasis require palliation local regional disease . Second stage ( phase II part ) Patients AJCC 7th edition stage IIIIVB ( T1T4 , N13M0 ) head neck cancer , except WHO type II III nasopharyngeal cancer , include unknown primary tumor . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma variant poorly differentiate carcinoma . Unidimensionally measurable disease ( RECIST criterion ) . ECOG performance status 02 In second stage study , therapy administer curative intent patient recurrent disease distant metastasis . Primary tumor and/or lymphadenopathy technically suitable intratumoral injection . The Otolaryngologist specialist head neck team determine feasibility . Participating patient agree undergo tumor biopsy baseline well approximately 2 week later specify study schema . Prior treatment First stage : prior treatment , except prior therapy , specifically directly target EGFR pathway , administer within last 6 month . No prior radiation therapy head neck . Second stage : prior chemotherapy , biologic/molecular target therapy ( include prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway ) , radiotherapy head neck cancer . Prior surgical therapy consist incisional excisional biopsy , include tonsillectomy , organ spar procedure , include neck dissection . Any nonbiopsy surgical procedure head neck cancer must take place least one month initiate protocol treatment , treat physician 's discretion . Patients must organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count above/equal 1,000/µL Platelets above/equal 75,000/µL Hemoglobin above/ equal 10 g/dL Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x upper normal institutional limit Creatinine clearance &gt; 20 mL/min Age 18 year old Because radiation therapy know teratogenic EFGR inhibitor may teratogenic potential , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation , 3 month complete study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Informed consent must obtain patient prior begin therapy . Patients ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min ) Treatment anticoagulant , except use maintain patency central venous line , INR &gt; 1.5 , PTT ratio &gt; 1.5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Patients may receive investigational agent . No history prior malignancy , exception curatively treat squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , DCIS LCIS breast , localize early stage prostate cancer , malignancy treat curative intent 3year diseasefree survival . Pregnant woman exclude study cetuximab , EGFR AS , radiation potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother cetuximab EGFR AS , breastfeed discontinue mother treated cetuximab . The effect cetuximab EGFR AS develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant study , inform treat physician immediately . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible drug interaction cetuximab . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . HIV status patient obtain patient 's history via discussion investigator . HIV test require . Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . Patients inform willing comply investigational nature study sign write informed consent accordance institutional good clinical practice guideline . Phase 2 ONLY ( second stage ) Subjects M1 disease exclude .</criteria>
