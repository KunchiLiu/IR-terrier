	<brief_summary>The antibiotic lock technique ( ALT ) use local treatment Catheter-Related Bacteremia ( CRB ) . It consist administration concentrate antimicrobial solution calculate volume fill lumen catheter . The lock solution indwell within catheter define period hour day remove . Currently , Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) Guidelines treatment management CRB , recommend change antibiotic solution every 24 hour . The investigator expect determine stability concentration vancomycin , teicoplanin , linezolid , daptomycin tigecycline use lock solution , thus assay optimal timeframe concentration antibiotic use lock solution keep vivo antimicrobial activity . Study Hypothesis : An antibiotic lock solution maintain vivo concentration antimicrobial activity least 10 day infusion inside subcutaneous port catheter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Assess antimicrobial concentration catheter-lock solution end port indwelling time . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) Assess bioactivity antimicrobial lock solution end port indwelling time . 2 ) Assess anticoagulant activity antimicrobial-lock solution end port indwelling time . Methods : Randomized , open , block allocation accord time indwell antimicrobial-lock within port , unicentric , clinical trial patient older 18 year old venous port implant Clínica Universidad de Navarra . Intevention : Randomization 5 patient one five antimicrobial-lock solution arm 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 10 day accord HPLC correct urea gradient . Any study arm stop time day 1 day 10 , case antimicrobial concentration would less 1 mg/mL . At end antimicrobial lock time frame port ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 10 day ) , antimicrobial concentration determine high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) correct urea gradient . The cut-off median antimicrobial concentration 1 mg/mL .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Intravenous access port recently insert ( ≤ 3 day insertion ) . Intravenous access port insert 3 day inform consent form signing patient . In case , blood sample catheter draw blood culture administration antibiotic lock solution . Informed Consent Form Signed . Patients confirm suspected local systemic infection relate catheter . Reported allergy intolerance antibiotic employ study lock solution . Patients receive oral , intravenous intramuscular antibiotic treatment moment inclusion clinical trial . Patients receive oral , intravenous subcutaneous anticoagulant treatment , high dose one use venous thrombosis prophylaxis moment inclusion clinical trial . Patients young 18 year old . Pregnant woman woman nurse period . Personal incapacity subscribe inform consent participate clinical trial . Patient Replacement Criteria : All patient and/or legal representative inform leave clinical trial whenever wish , without prejudice medical attention . Also , accord criterion principal investigator , patient could separate clinical trial . The reason separate patient study replace him/her : Severe adverse reaction could threat life patient . Resolution patient his/her legal representative abandon study . No attend extraction visit date . Development clinical inconvenience may indicate abandon study behalf patient . While antibiotic lock solution within port , manipulation use port administration kind medication fluid . Impossibility extract 4 ml antibiotic lock solution port . Impossibility extract 5 ml peripheral blood sample moment extraction antibiotic lock solution . Use prohibit medication antibiotic lock solution inside port . Intentionally wish patient abandon study antibiotic lock solution administer , antibiotic lock solution inside port . All patient abandon study would separate study expose reason , replace new candidate fulfil inclusion criterion sign informed consent form .</criteria>
