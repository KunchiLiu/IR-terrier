	<brief_summary>Patients ask part study liver transplant recipient Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) . Current routine treatment HCV liver transplant patient include take two medication call pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys® ) ribavirin . Patients Pegasys ribavirin FDA approve treatment HCV . This study evaluate safety efficacy add third drug call telaprevir experimental treatment HCV liver transplant patient . The combination Pegasys , ribavirin telaprevir currently FDA approve treatment HCV , specifically FDA approve HCV patient liver transplant . This information need possible drug interaction telaprevir cyclosporine , telaprevir tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive drug , typically part routine care transplant patient . Studies show addition telaprevir greatly increase efficacy Pegasys ribavirin treatment HCV . However , study include adequate information transplant patient due potential drug interaction . The investigator hope gather information safety efficacy telaprevir give combination Pegasys ribavirin liver transplant patient HCV well control Pegasys ribavirin alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cirrhosis HCV common indication OLT . Unfortunately , disease recurrence allograft virtually universal . The spectrum disease recurrence range minimal inflammation severe cholestasis well cirrhosis , lead allograft failure . Previous report indicate comparable survival rate patient receive OLT HCV receive OLT indication . More recent data , however , suggest HCV-positive recipient significantly impair patient allograft survival follow OLT compare HCV-negative recipient . Approximately 20 % patient recurrent HCV cirrhosis 5 year post-OLT . Attempts treat HCV recurrence OLT recipient limit success . Sustained virologic response ( SVR ) see 30 % patient genotype 1 infection , whereas SVR high 42-46 % non-transplant counterpart . Most recently , addition telaprevir pegylated interferon ribavirin comprise triple therapy nontransplant HCV-infected population lead significantly high sustain virologic response rate ( SVR ) 75 % compare 44 % observe control arm receive pegylated interferon ribavirin . Its side effect profile acceptable allow FDA approve drug May 23 , 2011 . However , data efficacy safety telaprevir OLT recipient . In fact , use population greatly hinder significant drug-drug interaction major immunosuppressive agent use OLT , namely tacrolimus cyclosporine . Telaprevir increase cyslosporine exposure 4.6 fold half-life 3.5 fold . It increase tacrolimus exposure 70 fold half-life 4.9 fold . Clearly , dose immunosuppressive agent need adjust start end telaprevir therapy . The primary aim study determine safety efficacy pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys® ) , ribavirin , telaprevir therapy liver transplant recipient hepatitis C recurrence maintain cyclosporine tacrolimus-based immunosuppression . We hypothesize triple therapy well sustain virologic response rate current standard care , pegylated interferon ribavirin , acceptable side-effect profile . STUDY DESIGN : Prospective , open-label , single center pilot study . All patient receive study drug along standard regimen pegylated interferon ribavirin . DRUG DOSE AND TREATMENT DURATION : Patients treat pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys® ) 180 mcg SQ per week , ribavirin 800-1200 mg PO per day ( weight-based ) 48 week . Telaprevir 750 mg PO tid administer first 12 week . Following completion therapy , patient follow another 24 week determine sustain response . *Doses low 800 mg/day may use investigator patient renal insufficiency ( ribavirin renally excrete ) , investigator 's discretion . RESEARCH PROTOCOL : This prospective study include patient histologic evidence recurrent HCV infection maintain cyclosporine-based immunosuppression . Patients qualify study identify Liver Transplant Clinic . Patients treat pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys® ) 180 mcg SQ per week , ribavirin 600-1200 mg PO per day , telaprevir 750 mg tid ( Incivek® ) 12 week , follow pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys® ) ribavirin another 36 week . Patients assess periodic interval safety adverse effect delineate Schedule Assessments ( Appendix A ) . Growth factor erythropoietin filgastrim allow event signficiant anemia thrombocytopenia develop therapy , discretion investigator . The HCV RNA measure baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 therapy well follow-up . Response therapy define HCV RNA &lt; 1000 IU/ml week 4 , 8 , 12 therapy , allow continuation treatment . Telaprevir discontinue HCV RNA &gt; 1000 IU/ml week 4 8 therapy , pegylated interferon ribavirin discontinue HCV RNA still detectable week 24 therapy . Cyclosporine tacrolimus trough level draw baseline , day 1,2 , 3 , 4,5 , 8 , continue every 2-3 day . The cyclosporine tacrolimus dose cut 50 % baseline cyclosporine tacrolimus dose adjustment make maintain level within target therapeutic range . Once two consecutive level within target therapeutic range achieve , level draw weekly first month biweekly end telaprevir treatment . After last dose telaprevir , cyclosporine tacrolimus level draw day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 continue every day , cyclosporine tacrolimus dose adjustment make maintain level within target therapeutic range . Once two consecutive level within target therapeutic range achieve , level draw week monthly week 24 therapy . Patients complete therapy continue follow 24 week determine sustain virologic response . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : This pilot , single arm study evaluate efficacy safety triple therapy recurrent HCV . All clinical laboratory data enter computer database . Categorical variable express proportion continuous variable express mean value .</detailed_description>
