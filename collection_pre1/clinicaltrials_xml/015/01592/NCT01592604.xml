	<brief_summary>Avulsion fracture base ( tuberosity ) fifth metatarsal bone common fracture foot , frequently treat fracture clinic involve significant resource . At present method treatment follow vary widely active treatment surgery , depend entirely treat doctor preference . There agreement simple , safe reliable method treatment . The investigator believe vast majority injury heal well without specific treatment . By compare two commonly use treatment investigator aim establish one simple , safe reliable mode treatment . The investigator go evaluate functional result two treatment short long time prospective , use best available scientific tool . The investigator believe result investigator study eventually lead change practise efficient NHS care patient . It reduce unnecessary treatment clinic appointment , bring substantial saving NHS long prospective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Optimal Treatment Avulsion Fractures Base Fith Metatarsal Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomised prospective control trial . Patients fracture normally first come Emergency Department ( ED ) , foot radiograph confirm fracture , initial treatment . This treatment arbitrary , depend assess clinician preference usually vary supportive tight bandage supportive plaster cast crutch . All patient normally refer orthopaedic fracture clinic . It orthopaedic trauma clinician fracture clinic determines take responsibility definitive management patient injury may decide change treatment initiate ED staff . The investigator inform clinical staff ED trial.The investigator provide ED clinicians patient information sheet . Patients information sheet provide ED hour 24 hour `` cool '' period consider information depend next fracture clinic availability . Then recruit fracture clinic wish participate . The investigator must stress , however , due nature ED service - high staff turn around , time pressure reason beyond control possible guarantee patient relevant injury receive information sheet ED `` cool '' period consider participation . In situation patient offer information sheet , counsel recruit , wish , first presentation fracture clinic . The investigator believe due practical issue relate ED service likely situation significant proportion patient . The investigator think unavoidable situation . Patients recruit first presentation fracture clinic consent . Using centralised electronic remote randomisation method patient allocate either group A ( symptomatic treatment ) - double tubigrip crutch recommendation weight bear comfortable normal footwear , group B ( active treatment ) - knee walk plaster cast crutch recommendation weight bear comfortable . This mean many patient initial treatment receive ED change often happen normal current practice . Two treatment mode use study - supportive bandage walk cast one commonly use normally . Patients decline participate study treat follow accord patient treat clinician preference also reflect current practice . This study therefore deviate little current common practice . Patients group B evaluate venous thrombo-embolism ( VTE ) risk accord Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust policy . Those whose risk high offer anti-thrombotic prophylaxis accord Trust policy duration cast immobilization ( 4 week ) . Those patient counsel benefit risk anti-thrombotic prophylaxis . On whole anticipate many patient require anti-thrombotic prophylaxis . Outcome measure : Primary outcome - foot functional outcome . We use Visual -Analogue-Scale Foot Ankle ( VAS FA ) score . This validated functional foot ankle score . Secondary outcome - A ) Health status functional outcome , - Euroqol ( EQ- 5D ) - standardise instrument use measure health outcome B ) - foot function - American Foot Ankle Society Foot Ankle functional ( AOFAS ) score . This foot ankle score validate , frequently use research literature . Additional outcome record unexpected return problem , change treatment modality , re-injury foot complication treatment . The investigator evaluate outcomes four time point . Firstly , patient complete baseline VAS FA , AOFAS , EQ-5D questinnaires provide level functional impairment/disability prior treatment . Patients group see clinic 4 week - stage cast remove group B . At point VAS FA , AOFAS , EQ-5D questionnaire fill patient group clinic . To see whether method treatment effect longer prospective investigator evaluate outcome 3 6 month . We anticipate time fracture heal uneventfully vast majority patient . We believe majority patient unlikely return clinic long time . For reason investigator post questionnaire patient group fill home post back u confidential prepay envelope one week respective 3 6 month follow . If patient decide withdraw , response , - attempt contact make . The investigator believe save unnecessary follow appointment , also yield result . In case problem patient able return fracture clinic help . The investigator ask patient group stop use crutch whenever feel like .</detailed_description>
