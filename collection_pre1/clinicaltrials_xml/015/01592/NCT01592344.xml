	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether StimRouter ( SR ) electrical stimulation therapy lead clinically important pain relief patient chronic intractable pain peripheral nerve origin three month treatment . At time , study gather information side effect associate StimRouter electrical stimulation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioness® StimRouter™ Neuromodulation System Chronic Pain Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety ( minimum ) one hundred twenty-six ( 126 ) adult ( ≥ 22 year ) subject severe intractable chronic pain peripheral nerve origin associate post traumatic/post surgical neuralgia persist 3 month long average chronic pain level least 5 0-10 numeric rating scale , pain attributable lesion disease somatosensory nervous system , recruit U.S. outpatient physical medicine rehabilitation clinic . After screen , subject confirm eligible study provide informed consent pain level assessment period approximately one week come back Baseline/Implantation visit . Subjects train required complete patient diary pain intensity level least 7 consecutive day prior baseline . The randomization program take place approximately two week implantation . Subjects treatment group receive electrical stimulation pain medication . In contrast , subject parallel control group receive control stimulation pain medication . The plan parallel portion study run approximately 12 week ( 3 month ) randomization efficacy analysis . Subjects control group allow cross treatment group nine month electrical stimulation ; subject treatment group nine additional month stimulation treatment safety data collect throughout full twelve month period available subject . While end study approximately 12 month randomization , previously state , efficacy analysis base data collect end 3-month follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
