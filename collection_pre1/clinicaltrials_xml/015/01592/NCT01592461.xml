This study information supplement ( electronic ) medical administrative record , available . An intent-to-treat design adopt include 1,269 study participant enrol START . Figure 1 present summary timeline conduct project activity . There three participant interview five year project . After receive IRB approval conduct study , START community treatment provider ( CTP ) Node staff contact START participant , obtain participant consent take part follow-up study , conduct initial assessment . This assessment take place clinic possible phone participant able come person . By agree take part study participant agree : 1 . Updating locator information initially throughout duration study ; 2 . Sharing clinic survey data lead research team ( UCLA ) ; 3 . Completing various assessment provide urine oral fluid/blood specimen lab assessment ; 4 . Providing access administrative record ( e.g. , medical record , criminal justice record ) ; 5 . Being contact study staff 2 interview person phone ( consent prior interview ) . Local CTP Node staff conduct Visit 1 interview Years 1-2 START follow-up study .

The Lead Node staff conduct Visit 2 interview telephone approximately 12 month completion Visit 1 . The Lead Node and/or CTP staff conduct another participant interview approximately 12-18 month Visit 2 complete . If study participant find late study progress Visit 1 , follow visit , 2 3 occur sooner originally plan , far apart possible . All assessment complete end Year 5 START follow-up study .</detailed_description>
