	<brief_summary>Motor vehicle collision lead cause death young people . The investigator recently find drive use cannabis common among young Canadian driver drive drinking . While observation raise concern , effect cannabis driving-related skill age group well understood . As well , evidence suggest residual effect cannabis driving-related skill may observe 24 hour later . These residual effect may important implication effect cannabis use collision risk , little evidence available . This study examine effect single dose cannabis ( marijuana ) driving-related skill immediately follow consumption , 24 hour later , 48 hour later . To date , residual effect 48 hour examine . A total 142 subject age 19 25 year old randomly assign smoke either placebo active cannabis cigarette ( 12.5 % THC potency ) . Following eligibility screen practice session , participant attend 3 testing day ; drug-administration , 24-hour follow-up 48-hour follow-up . The effect cannabis/placebo performance driving-related skill use high-fidelity driving simulator assess test day . The effect cannabis mood , cognition , memory complex reaction time also assess . Identifying factor affect collision risk experience young driver public health priority . While many young people believe cannabis impair driving , recent study suggest may dangerous belief . This study provide important information cannabis may affect drive skill young driver , inform effort understand address cannabis-related collision age group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test prediction residual effect acute dose cannabis driving-related skill observe group young driver 48 hour follow single dose smoke cannabis , also examine effect acute dose cannabis skill use drive simulator technology . Study Objectives 1 . Examine residual effect moderate dose cannabis ( 12.5 % THC ) drive simulator performance young driver . Simulated driving performance , test cognition , verbal memory , mood measure concurrently level cannabinoids biological fluid approximately 24 48 hour follow acute drug exposure male female driver age 19 25 . We test hypothesis performance high-fidelity drive simulator task significantly impair approximately 24 hour follow dose cannabis comparison placebo condition . 2 . Examine acute effect moderate dose cannabis ( 12.5 % THC ) drive simulator performance young driver . Simulated driving performance , test cognition , verbal memory , mood measure concurrently level cannabinoids biological fluid drug administration . Cannabinoid level biological fluid measure 6 hour period follow drug exposure . We examine relationship cannabinoid level performance measure time frame . 3 . Explore effect drive history , drive attitude , individual difference measure ( e.g. , demographic , drug alcohol use , etc . ) acute residual effect cannabis drive simulator performance young driver . Exploratory analysis undertaken determine acute residual effect cannabis drive simulator task influence measure . 4 . Determine relationship exist genetics THC response . As ancillary aim , blood sample may collect future research determine relationship exist genetic polymorphism pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic response cannabis . Study Design Duration The study double-blind , placebo-controlled mixed-design study , include randomize between-subjects comparison effect smoke cannabis between- within-subjects examination residual effect 24 48 hour follow one-time drug administration . Although placebo condition part study , treatment study . Initial contact potential subject make via telephone , study personnel conduct telephone screen eligibility . Upon eligibility confirmation telephone , participant ask attend CAMH eligibility assessment . The study consist 5 session subject ( eligibility assessment , practice day , three subsequent test day ) . Participants ask use cannabis 48 hour prior attend practice day ( Session 2 ) . Although Session 1 complete time prior remain study session , Sessions 2 - 5 must perform consecutive day . In certain instance , Qualified Investigator may ask participant return re-screening , e.g . repeat urine test assessment perform eligibility assessment . Also , case unforeseen delay schedule study participation , Qualified Investigator determine need ask participant repeat assessment , e.g. , physical examination .</detailed_description>
