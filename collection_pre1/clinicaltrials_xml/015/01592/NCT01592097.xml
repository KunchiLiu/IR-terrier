	<brief_summary>Gilenya ( fingolimod ) approve multiple sclerosis . However , unclear clinical effect Hispanics MS give clinical study limit representation population . It also unclear Gilenya would effective individual disease predominantly affect optic nerve spinal cord ( OSMS ) commonly see Asian population . Objectives : To compare clinical response Gilenya® ( fingolimod ) relapse remit OSMS MS Hispanic descent use ancestral marker biomarker treatment response clinical disease state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Assess Clinical Response Gilenya® ( Fingolimod ) Hispanics With RRMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine success Gilenya® ( fingolimod ) treatment patient MS Hispanic descent relative ancestral background . Therapeutic success determine annualized relapse rate ( ARR ; define number relapse divide person year follow ) initiation treatment Gilenya® ( fingolimod ) comparison relapse rate previous 12 month . This determine base medical chart extraction , in-person assessment regular clinical follow-up . A secondary objective study investigate whether efficacy Gilenya® ( fingolimod ) superior equal HW high load Amerindian versus Caucasian background opticospinal MS ( OSMS-NMO neg ) versus classical MS ( CMS ) first 12 month use radiological clinical parameter . The following measure obtain : 1 . Number relapse-free patient investigational period 2 . Site relapse define brain spinal cord . 3 . Sustained Disability progression define one point ( 1 ) increase baseline patient baseline EDSS score 0 5.0 ; half point ( 0.5 ) increase patient baseline EDSS score 5-5.5 3 month . 4 . MRI change describe number new T2 lesion number Gd-enhancing lesion 12 month baseline .</detailed_description>
