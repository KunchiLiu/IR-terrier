	<brief_summary>Stimulation arterial inflow lower limb important obtain functional improvement peripheral artery diseased ( PAD ) patient claudication . The clinical effect muscle stimulation increase arterial inflow direct evaluation regional blood flow impairment ( RBFI ) area stimulation , evaluate PAD patient . Fifteen adult patient stable arterial claudication participate . Recruitment perform among patient refer exercise oxymetry ( treadmill : 3.2km.h-1 , 10 % slope ) After two minute rest , gastrocnemius stimulate 20 minute increase frequency rate 5 min step ( 1 Hz , 1.25 Hz , 1.5 Hz 1.75 Hz ) symptomatic side . The investigator record tcpo2 value , arterial blood inflow ultrasound femoral artery , near infra-red spectrometry ( NIRS ) side . Patients instructed report eventual contraction-induced pain stimulate calf .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arterial Inflow Muscle Ischemia During Calf Stimulation With Veinoplus Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigations conduct air-conditioned 22+/-2 °C room , patient comfortably seat armchair . Measured ware start rest perform throughout period pf stimulation 10 minute end stimulation Muscle stimulation : We apply series 20 minute stimulation Veinoplus® device . The device delivers stimulation incremental rate 5 minute interval , 1 Hz , 1.25 Hz , 1.5 Hz 1.75 Hz stop automatically . Ultrasound measurement The Diameter superficial femoral artery measure rest side study . The VTI 3 cardiac cycle ( three peak systolic velocity ) measure duplex ultrasound image , calculate arterial inflow leg . Results express l /min . Tcpo2 record TcpO2 measure chest calf TCM 400 ( Radiometer , DK ) . Results express DROP index ( mmHg ) value . Near Infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) We use ARTinis NIRS device ( ARTinis ; NL ) estimate tissue saturation ( StO2 ) gastrocnemius muscle leg . Systemic hemodynamic parameter Systemic diastolic arterial pressure heart rate record every two minute use Dinamap V100 ( GE france ) .</detailed_description>
