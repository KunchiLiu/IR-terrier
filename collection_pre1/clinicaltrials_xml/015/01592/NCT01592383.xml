	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) erlotinib malignant peritoneal mesothelioma ( MPeM ) patient epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine percentage patient MPeM EGFR mutation . II . To characterize asbestos exposure history clinical parameter patient MPeM EGFR mutation . III . To determine disease control rate ( CR + PR + stable disease [ SD ] ) MPeM patient EGFR mutation treat erlotinib . IV . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) MPeM patient EGFR mutation treat erlotinib . V. To determine median overall survival ( OS ) MPeM patient EGFR mutation treat erlotinib . VI . To evaluate toxicity MPeM patient EGFR mutation treat erlotinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize specific EGFR mutation observe MPeM patient . II . To correlate tumor marker ( cancer antigen [ CA ] 125 soluble mesothelin-related peptide [ SMRP ] ) response rate , PFS , OS MPeM patient treat erlotinib . III . To correlate immunohistochemical stain EGFR , phosphorylated ( p ) -EGFR , MET ( Metastasis ) , E-cadherin , vimentin , CBL ( Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma ) EGFR mutational status , present , particular EGFR mutation note . IV . To correlate immunohistochemical stain EGFR , p-EGFR , MET , E-cadherin , vimentin , CBL response rate , PFS , OS MPeM patient treat erlotinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma ; epithelial , sarcomatoid , biphasic , welldifferentiated papillary subtypes allow . A tumor block 10 unstained slide must available determine EGFR mutational status ; patient mutation EGFR tyrosine kinase domain able enroll study . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . No prior use EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor monoclonal antibody ; prior treatment allow &gt; = 4 week since treatment complete , include chemotherapy ( systemic intraperitoneal ) , radiation therapy , and/or surgery ; limit number previous treatment allow . Life expectancy great 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . Leukocytes &gt; = 2,000/mcL . Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL . Platelets &gt; = 100,000/mcL . Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) = &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN . Creatinine = &lt; 2 X institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance &gt; = 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect erlotinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown ; reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed screen treatment consent . Chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop . progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition erlotinib . EGFRmutation negative tumor tissue determine sequencing ; individual tissue test result inconclusive ( unable determine ) , consider negative study eligibility purpose . History previous malignancy exclude nonmelanoma skin lesion insitu cervical cancer ; patient malignancy eligible disease free &gt; = 3 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study unknown erlotinib pose potential teratogenic abortifacient effect ; unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother erlotinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated erlotinib . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib ; addition , patient increase risk lethal infection ; appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Inability tolerate absorb oral medication due cause , include limited malabsorption syndrome .</criteria>
