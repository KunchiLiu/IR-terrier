	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare stereotactic radiosurgery whole brain radiation therapy patient 4-10 non-melanoma brain tumor . Stereotactic radiosurgery delivery focus , high-dose radiation give single session tumor minimal dose give uninvolved area brain . Whole brain radiation delivery low dose radiation entire brain give daily 2 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Phase III Trial Compare Stereotactic Radiosurgery Versus Whole Brain Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . You equal chance assign either group : - If Group 1 , receive whole brain radiation treatment . - If Group 2 , receive stereotactic radiosurgery . Study Procedures : If Group 1 , receive whole brain radiation treatment day , Monday-Friday start Day 1 . If inpatient , may receive radiation treatment weekend well . You continue receive radiation treatment Day 14 . If Group 2 , receive stereotactic radiosurgery Day 1 . As part stereotactic radiosurgery procedure , receive accurate kind MRI scan morning procedure . If MRI scan identifies tumor , may still continue participate study 15 tumor . If 15 tumor find treatment planning MRI scan day SRS treatment , eligible participate study . In case , study doctor discus treatment option study , may include stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiation therapy . No matter group , sign separate consent form whole brain radiation stereotactic radiosurgery explain procedure risk detail . Study Visits : At 1 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month ( +/- 14 day ) assign treatment , return clinic : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug may take . - You MRI scan check status disease . - You complete 7 cognitive function test . - You complete 3 questionnaire ask quality life symptom may . Length Study Participation : Your active participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : If study doctor think need , return clinic follow-up visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug may take . - You MRI check status disease . This investigational study . It consider investigational compare stereotactic radiosurgery whole brain radiation therapy patient 4-10 non-melanoma brain tumor . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient must histological proof malignant cancer , metastatic . Histological proof may obtain primary tumor another metastatic site . However , cytology alone acceptable method diagnosis . 2 . All patient must great 3 less equal 10 metastatic lesion see contrast enhance MRI scan obtain less one month prior study enrollment . Patients find 1115 metastatic lesion time treatment planning ( volumetric MRI head frame place ) may still participate trial . 3 . All patient must &gt; /= 18 year age . 4 . All patient must sign informed consent verify aware investigational nature study keep rule policy M.D . Anderson Cancer Center . The acceptable consent form one attached end protocol , must approve amended M.D . Anderson IRB . 5 . All patient must eligible lesion treat SRS ( i.e . maximum diameter large lesion &lt; 3.5cm ) determine radiation oncologist . 6 . All patient must adequate liver , renal , hematologic function define Aspartate Amino Transferase ( AST ) /Alanine Amino Transferase ( ALT ) /Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 2.5 time normal , calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30ml/min , platelet count &gt; 50,000 . 7 . All patient normal coagulation , international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.3 able withhold anticoagulation medication minimum 24 hour prior radiosurgery ( INR normalizes ) , day treatment 24 hour radiosurgery conclude . Those patient get WBRT may continue medication . 8 . Patients undergoing concurrent systemic therapy , temozolomide , discretion treat oncologist . 1 . Patients exclude trial melanoma , small cell carcinoma , lymphoma/leukemia , germ cell histology ( note , melanoma patient eligible sister trial trial open simultaneously ) . 2 . Patients exclude prior surgical resection metastatic cancer brain . 3 . Patients exclude radiographic CSF cytological evidence leptomeningeal disease . 4 . Patients exclude prior Whole Brain Radiotherapy ( WBRT ) prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) . Prior SRS Gamma Knife radiosurgery 13 metastasis minimum ( 6 ) week recent scan allow protocol . 5 . Female patient childbearing age exclude pregnant assessed serum bHCG urine pregnancy test . A serum bHCG test urine pregnancy test perform great 14 day prior study registration . 6 . Patients exclude unable obtain MRI scan . 7 . Patients exclude &lt; 4 lesion , &gt; 10 lesion enrollment &gt; 15 lesion time treatment ( note : patient qualify enrollment base 410 lesion , discover 1115 lesion volumetric MRI use treatment planning allow continue study ) .</criteria>
