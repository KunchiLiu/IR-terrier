	<brief_summary>The role maintenance therapy management Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) confirm . Many treatment modality like chemotherapy , interferon biological agent test maintenance therapy SCLC , result disappoint . A marginal survival advantage see maintenance chemotherapy interferon-alpha , however , function status immune system may get bad , subsequently negative impact patient 's quality-of-life . Immunotherapy autologous cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell activate antitumor defense mechanism stimulate immune response alter interaction tumor host . This effect may result improved tumor control survival , well good quality life . To test hypothesis , randomize control study conduct compare CIK cell best supportive care maintenance therapy SCLC .</brief_summary>
