Local anesthetic block nerve describe show effective immediate postoperative pain control . Recently , use On-Q pain relief system catheter place within TAP evaluate . Published result show significant improvement pain control ( Forastiere ) . The idea place pain catheter TAP plane seem coherent anatomical distribution sensory nerve trunk . Due lack prospective trial investigate effectiveness continuous wound infusion local anesthetic general surgery procedures investigator seek determine efficacy technique laparoscopic colon resection procedure .</brief_summary>
