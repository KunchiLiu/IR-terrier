	<brief_title>Study Anesthesia Techniques Reduce Nausea Vomiting After Jaw Corrective Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative post-discharge nausea vomiting ( PONV PDNV ) plague post-anesthesia surgical care . This fact remain especially true orthognathic surgery ( OS ) population undergo procedure involve maxilla . Current data estimate incidence PONV OS patient undergo surgery involve maxilla 44 % 68 % compare 8 % 30 % general surgical population , despite application conventional therapy . No one account addressed difference clinical outcome . The implication PONV individual health overall health care system function considerable . For individual patient , PONV result dehydration , wound dehiscence , intra-oral bleeding continue swallow blood , significant anxiety agitation ( particularly OS patient often heavy elastic close jaw together surgery ) , , extreme case , esophageal damage risk pulmonary aspiration . Evidence show fear PONV overshadow concern pain surgical patient . At health care system level , evidence suggest PONV significantly increase health care cost prolong post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) stay unplanned hospital admission follow outpatient procedure . In one seminal study odds ratio unplanned admission due vomit intended outpatient surgery 3.4 , alarmingly high figure exceed odds ratio readmission due pain bleeding . Established patient-related risk factor PONV include female gender , tobacco abstinence , history prior PONV motion sickness ; additional patient factor may include young age , low American Society Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System status , anxiety , migraine headache history . Known anesthesia technique-related risk factor include volatile anesthetic nitrous oxide use well excessive IV opioid administration . High dose neuromuscular blockade reversal agent also implicate . Surgery-related factor include duration surgery type surgery , OS rank among high-risk type . Because PONV ( PDNV ) prevention treatment OS population remain under-investigated domain clinical care , investigator seek address deficiency multi-modal prophylactic therapy . As OS procedure perform , many ambulatory basis , tactic reduce high incidence PONV surgical population become important maximize patient safety satisfaction contain cost . The investigator ' protocol synthesize several recommendation reduce risk PONV . Volatile anesthetic nitrous oxide avoid favor total intravenous ( IV ) anesthetic involve propofol , neostigmine minimize , hydration goal set , opioid spar analgesic utilized . It recommend patient high risk PONV receive combination therapy prophylactic agent multiple class . Among show reduce PONV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ( ondansetron ) , droperidol , dexamethasone . Transdermal ( TD ) scopolamine another effective adjunctive therapy reduce PONV . Additionally , investigator posit constant swallow small amount ooze blood retention stomach follow OS contribute high incidence PONV PDNV OS population . Thus sub-bacteriostatic dos erythromycin , capitalize erythromycin 's establish property motilin agonist thus pro-kinetic , add evidence-based multi-modal regimen . Erythromycin chosen metoclopramide due safety profile well-characterized impact gastric motility even PONV . Rescue anti-nausea anti-emetic therapy choose several option discretion treat physician . Options work several mechanism select base Society Ambulatory Anesthesia Guidelines data randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study 2000 subject . Anesthesia variables well post-operative analgesic regimen primary target investigator ' multimodal regimen . Multimodal therapy show superior single agent therapy . One particularly compelling example show 98 % response rate ( PONV ) vs 76 % among receive mono-therapy 59 % receive routine anesthesia placebo . Despite report success , PONV remain major problem patient undergo OS many procedure . This study represent one step towards understand address significant peri-operative problem . This propose study compare cohort receive multimodal regimen retrospective control cohort review IRB-approved study institution . The investigator ' re-use data add risk harm disclosure control subject . Utilization retrospective control important advantage concurrent control : It allow comparison group treat institution without potential introduction bias alert practitioner extent PONV problem OS . The investigator believe , under-recognition OS group high-risk likely contribute high rate PONV patient experience , education anesthesia community introduce potential confound variable . Further , compare practice `` '' propose protocol maximize generalizability institution . If , anticipate , significant reduction PONV PDNV experience find , prospective randomize trial tease nuance contribute factor could undertake . Potential influence patient- surgery-related variable collect allow comparison two cohort use logistic regression analysis . Even less well understood PONV PDNV ; additional study need deepen understanding risk factor treatment option PDNV . A prior study investigator ' institution demonstrate high incidence PDNV OS population - 43 % experience nausea 23 % vomited discharge contrast general report rate 17 % PDN 8 % PDV . This study offer additional insight PONV 's less understood counterpart diary review patient 's self-reported experience PDNV follow discharge direct medical supervision .</detailed_description>
