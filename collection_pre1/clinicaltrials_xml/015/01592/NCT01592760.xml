	<brief_summary>The air-Q Self-Pressurizing Intubating Laryngeal Airway ( aILA SP ) modification air-Q Intubating Laryngeal Airway ( aILA ) . Besides i-gel , breathe tube sits vocal cord require inflation cuff air . The purpose study compare ability aILA-SP maintain patency patient 's airway general anesthesia aILA i-gel device . As measure ability , hypothesize airway seal pressure equal aILA-SP aILA , superior compare aILA-SP i-gel ( i-gel low ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laryngeal mask airway ( LMAs ) group airway device , alternatively refer supraglottic airway ( SGAs ) , use anesthesia position back throat ( pharynx ) ( supra ) glottis ( windpipe opening ) vocal cord . This contradistinction tracheal tube , airway device place vocal cord extend position glottis ( infraglottic ) reside trachea ( windpipe ) . Since first approval use United States US Food Drug Administration early 1990s , application SGAs become widespread . Initially , use anesthetized patient breathe ( i.e. , spontaneously ventilate ) . This , large part , due relatively low airway seal pressure , pressure device seal throat , thereby , keep air push breathe machine ( ventilator ) get stomach leak around device mouth - either case , go patient 's lung . The relatively low airway seal pressure ( 18 - 20 cmH2O ) allow use muscle relaxant ( paralyze ) drug positive pressure ventilation . Successive generation SGAs variety manufacturer overcome continue attempt overcome limitation earlier device . In addition , accumulate clinical experience make anesthesia provider comfortable use . No SGA , however , yet ideal , incremental change continue appear improve airway management reduce airway morbidity ( e.g. , sore throat , jaw pain , etc. ) . The air-Q® Intubating Laryngeal Airway ( aILA , Mercury Medical , Clearwater , FL ) new , commercially-available , SGA design use primary airway intubation conduit . It available polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) -based , single use silicone-based , reusable model . Information safety effectiveness randomize , control trial adult , undergo general anesthesia , compare silicone-based , reusable aILA versus LMA-Proseal™ ( pLMA , North America , San Diego , CA ) , current `` gold standard '' SGA airway seal pressure , available . The air-Q® Self-Pressurizing ( SP ) Intubating Laryngeal Airway ( aILA-SP , Mercury Medical , Clearwater , FL ) commercially-available , modification silicone-based , reusable aILA . Its overall design identical aILA , incorporate communication orifice air tube cuff , regulate airflow cuff period positive pressure spontaneous ventilation . As , incorporate self-pressurizing cuff require manual inflation . Such cuff may advantageous insofar dynamically adjust intra-cuff pressure fit patient 's pharyngeal periglottic anatomy , may lead reduction airway morbidity , still provide high seal pressure afford aILA design . Lastly , i-gel ( Intersurgical Inc. , Liverpool , NY ) commercially-available SGA use thermoplastic elastomer create non-inflating , anatomically-conforming , periglottic cuff . Studies show easily insert , effective airway device low incidence sore throat neck complaint . With exception aILA-SP , commercially-available SGA require cuff inflation . To date , report available clinical performance aILA-SP relation SGAs . Thus , primary purpose study compare airway seal pressure ( ASP ) aILA-SP aILA i-gel adult undergo general anesthesia . Airway seal pressure common surrogate ventilatory capacity use SGA study .</detailed_description>
