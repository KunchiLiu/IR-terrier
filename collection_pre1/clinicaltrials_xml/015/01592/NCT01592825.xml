	<brief_summary>The improvement heal rate breast cancer base important part consistent use so-called adjuvant ( `` support `` ) medicamentous therapy , include chemotherapy . However success price due still inaccurate knowledge individual risk relapse : high number unnecessary therapy apply ( over-therapy ! ) . The invasion factor uPA ( plasminogen activator urokinase type ) PAI-1 ( uPA inhibitor ) describe extensively strong independent prognosis factor high clinical relevance patient node negative breast cancer . Compared clinical pathological factor ( : `` traditional factor `` ) show good estimation relapse risk lead avoidance redundant adjuvant chemotherapy may thus essentially contribute improvement quality life woman . In study aim evaluate , large portion patient early , operable , node negative breast cancer , , improve low-risk identification uPA/PAI-1 , adjuvant chemotherapy omit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The determination prognostic factor uPA/PAI-1 ( : `` biological '' ) establish recommend recent guideline . However , far data show independent strong prognostic influence . The absolute proportion patient , profit improve risk assessment , estimate old trial different patient population . Depending upon assessment , proportion low risk patient traditional risk assessment 20 - 40 % , biological assessment 35 - 55 % node negative patient . The data investigation historic population reproducible small tumor size presentation due diagnostic procedure ( Screening , good public promotion ) . The effectiveness clinical relevance risk assessment already confirm biological prognostic factor uPA/PAI-1 node negative breast cancer several retrospective prospective trial well meta-analysis . Still biological factor ( others ! ) yet establish nationwide clinical routine Germany . This due high expenditure method primary therapy ( uPA/PAI-1 determine shock-frozen tissue ) , hand due absence reimbursement . Therefore presently many centre risk estimation associate therapy decision do traditional assessment . In order justify high expenditure additional cost uPA/PAI-1-determination , clear proof advantage individual patient , also estimation extent advantage applicable patient necessary . A first goal project compare respective proportion patient allocate high- low-risk mean biological also traditional prognosis factor define consecutive patient cohort . The determination uPA/PAI-1 establish standard procedure future . So far , question discuss refer mainly patient node negative breast cancer . In group , large effect save chemotherapy expect . Due previous result assume also node positive patient adjuvant chemotherapy may save sub-group small risk recurrence . Therefore determination uPA/PAI-1 group patient also do end study . A second goal project collect data risk assessment node positive patient able offer assistance future perhaps give good estimation individual risk recurrence . Practically fresh frozen tissue take , shock-frozen store consecutive patient operate five participate hospital . The determination uPA/PAI-1 perform research laboratory department Gynaecology University Hospital Halle ( Saale ) . A third goal provide biological risk assessment give result uPA/PAI-1 test promptly participate node negative patient . This information crucial decision chemotherapy .

The list gene submit Ethics sommittee . B ) Eplorative analysis factor concern response therapy do . C ) Follow-up information collect minimum observation time 2.5 year patient ( October 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
