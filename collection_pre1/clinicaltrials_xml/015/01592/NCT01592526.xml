	<brief_summary>Critical illness , severe infection , extensive trauma tissue damage cause inflammatory ( irritative ) reaction body . This reaction affect whole body cause malaise , circulatory cardiac change , fever , increase number white blood cell blood stream prompt release signal protein . This reaction contribute development considerable organ damage possibly organ failure . These serious complication critical illness associate high mortality . This inflammatory reaction affect autonomic nervous system . This part nervous system , beyond control free , part regulate circulation , breathe digestive function . The autonomic nervous system work via so-called sympathetic signal , set body state alertness overcome immediate challenge , parasympathetic ( vagal ) signal , especially active restitution rest . It known , balanced activity autonomic nervous system affect body 's inflammatory response critical illness . A study mice show parasympathetic ( vagal ) signal block mortality critical illness increase . Reversely , autonomic nervous system medically stimulate towards parasympathetic signaling , magnitude inflammatory response decrease . Nicotine exert stimulatory effect . Also , know individual good physical shape increase parasympathetic tone compare less trained individual . However , study never address whether shift balance autonomic nervous system affect inflammatory response relate critical illness . Over last 30 year experimental model mimic inflammatory response use study . Inflammation may simulate inject drug E.Coli LPS , induces control , fully reversible , harmless reaction duration hour . Influenza-like symptom occur change circulatory parameter concentration signal protein measure . Using experimental model , investigator wish study whether shift balance autonomic nervous system individual good physical shape affect body 's reaction critical illness . Investigators also want determine nicotine ( use nicotine patch ) affect reaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autonomic Nervous Activity During Systemic Inflammatory Response Trained Untrained Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim The investigator wish study inflammatory response well-trained relatively untrained healthy volunteer use human endotoxemia model . Also , investigator wish study effect nicotine inflammatory response.. Background 1 . Systemic inflammation endotoxin model Inflammation organisms response invasion microorganism , trauma , endogenic exogenic tissue damage . Systemic inflammation generalize response affect entire organism present symptom ( malaise , shiver , dizziness , nausea ) , clinical manifestation ( fever , tachypnea hypocapnia , tachycardia ) biochemical finding alter number relative composition leucocytes blood increase concentration acute phase reactant cytokine . Systemic inflammation , activate cascade microcirculatory disruption consider important pathogenic element ind development organ dysfunction , frequent serious complication critical illness regardless underlying cause . Over last 30 year human endotoxemia model u experimental platform study systemic inflammation . Since year 1998 study use model conduct Center Inflammation Metabolism ( CIM ) , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital . An IV-bolus infusion E.Coli-lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , isolated component outer cell wall Gram-negative bacteria , also refer endotoxin , administer healthy volunteer . A dose-dependent , fully reversible response evoke duration hour flu-like symptom production pro- anti-inflammatory marker , e.g tumor-necrosis-factor-α ( TNF ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1β , IL-6 , IL-1ra IL-10 . Serious adverse event observe . The model accurate replication acute infection , sepsis critical illness , however , evokes reproducible , inter-individually comparable fully reversible inflammatory response , allow experimental study early stage acute systemic inflammation interplay different aspect critical illness complicate systemic inflammation . 2 . The autonomic nervous system inflammatory response Activity autonomic nervous system affect inflammatory response . Vagal stimulation inhibits release pro-inflammatory cytokine , TNF-α , IL-1 , IL-6 high mobility group box protein-1 ( HMGB-1 ) , macrophage activate endotoxin , however , inhibit anti-inflammatory IL-10 . Cytologic study document , effect mediate via nicotinergic α7-subtype acetylcholine-receptor ( α7nAchR ) . In murine model peripheral vagal stimulation vivo decrease mortality endotoxemia sepsis cecal ligation . Kox et al find , GTS-21 - specific α7nAchR-agonist - generally associate altered inflammatory response human endotoxemia , however , identify negative correlation plasma concentration GTS-21 intervention group maximal TNF-concentration . In another study , transdermally administer nicotine healthy volunteer reduce clinical , inflammatory response reduce change body temperature heart rate increase plasma concentration cortisol anti-inflammatory IL-10 . No difference TNF-α , IL-1 IL-6 expression detect . 3 . Heart rate variability Heart rate variability ( HRV ) variation interval successive heart beat time . It well-described phenomenon believe reflect cardiac balance sympathetic- vagal activity , thus change HRV may interpret indirect marker change autonomic nervous activity . Physiological pathological change autonomic nervous activity observe performance standardize valsalva maneuver monitoring blood pressure , heart rate subsequent calculation HRV blood pressure variability . Reduced HRV present critical illness believe reflect shift autonomic nervous balance towards increase sympathetic activity vagal withdrawal . This phenomenon well document predictor poor outcome . Equally , reduce heart rate variability observe human endotoxemia healthy volunteer . However , magnitude reduction HRV correspond severity inflammatory response determine plasma concentration pro-inflammatory cytokine . Individuals excellent training status present alter activity autonomic nervous system increase vagal activity low rest heart rate increase HRV . Whether alter autonomic activity still present critical illness unknown , possibility certain positive effect physical activity may part due increased vagal activity alteration systemic inflammatory response mediate vagal activity . 4 . Exercise inflammatory response No previous vivo study address impact increase vagal activity well-trained individual inflammatory response comparison see untrained individual . In mentioned study Jan et al analysis baseline HRV find HRV component traditionally consider proportional sympathetic activity ( LF/HF ) correlate inversely maximal TNF-α concentration plasma . Furthermore , study find heart rate baseline correlate HRV characteristic neither baseline endotoxemia . However , physical training condition participant report . Likewise , mention physical training status make mention study concern experimental use nicotinergic agonist endotoxemia ( transdermally administer nicotine29 orally administer GTS-21 ) . Two vitro trial perform whole blood stimulation LPS find baseline HRV inversely proportional TNF IL-6 production , inflammatory response vitro reduce previously untrained individual period regular aerobic exercise . No vivo study address conduct . The investigator aim study inflammatory response endotoxemia well-trained untrained healthy volunteer determine whether transdermally administer nicotine alters response . A cross-over study design apply volunteer act control . This increase chance demonstrate statistically significant effect . Due risk LPS-tolerance two study day need least 4 week apart . Hypotheses 1 . Healthy well-trained individual produce reduce inflammatory response experimental endotoxemia compare untrained individual . 2 . Healthy , well-trained individual display increase HRV baseline experience small reduction HRV endotoxemia compare untrained individual . 3 . Transdermally administer nicotine endotoxemia reduces clinical preclinical feature inflammatory response endotoxemia well-trained well untrained individual . 4 . Endotoxemia induce transitory state hyperalgesia well-trained well untrained volunteer .</detailed_description>
