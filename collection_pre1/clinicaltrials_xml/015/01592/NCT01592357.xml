	<brief_summary>Cardiac exercise rehabilitation consist walk bicycle activity . As population require rehabilitation age , form exercise may useful well tolerate . Tai Chi use century , easy perform even debilitated individual , promotes improvement blood pressure , fitness , relaxation . Tai Chi may beneficial frail cardiac patient especially suit unfit elderly , practice anywhere . Further study require assess form exercise cardiac patient . The objective randomized control study compare effect Tai Chi `` sham exercise '' train 200 frail cardiac patient complete six month cardiac rehabilitation 60 year age old . Participants randomize Tai Chi `` sham exercise '' training gait speed , blood pressure , heart rate , exercise capacity , balance , quality life cognitive function assess 24 week training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Tai Chi Older Patients With Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role exercise training well establish cardiac patient improve fitness clinical outcome . Many old cardiac patient even initially participate maintain regular exercise number reason . As population age need evaluate form exercise training may use alone conjunction standard approach . Tai Chi potentially beneficial exercise old cardiac patient low-intensity exercise especially suit unfit elderly patient . There little rigorous evaluation , especially cardiac population , Tai Chi . The main objective study assess effect Tai Chi compare `` sham exercise '' cardiac patient complete program cardiac rehabilitation . The investigator hope show six month Tai Chi training compare `` sham exercise '' ( participant instruct maintain standard exercise program ) , improve gait speed , exercise capacity , health relate quality life , cognitive function balance . This single blind randomize control trial 200 cardiac patient , great equal 60 year age , complete six month cardiac rehabilitation Hamilton Health Science Cardiac Health Rehabilitation Centre . Participants randomize receive either short simple 8-forms Tai Chi routine `` sham exercise '' . The participant study train period six month .</detailed_description>
