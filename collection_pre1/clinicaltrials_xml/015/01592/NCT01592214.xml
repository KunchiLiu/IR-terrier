	<detailed_description>This Phase I , multi-center , clinical study XF-73 evaluate local ( nasal ) safety tolerability modify , thinner , low viscosity formulation intranasal XF-73 healthy male female subject . In addition , potential systemic absorption XF-73 modify , thinner , low viscosity previously investigate thicker , high viscosity formulation decolonization efficacy comparison placebo evaluate . Both part study double-blinded , Part 2 also placebo-controlled . Study subject healthy volunteer , male female , age 18 - 45 year . The study conduct two distinct part . In Part 1 study 8 healthy male female subject , age 18 45 year , two group four per formulation study duration 36 day . All subject receive intranasal application 5,15-bis- [ 4- ( 3-Trimethylammonio-propyloxy ) -phenyl ] -porphyrin dichloride ( XF-73 ) . In Part 2 , subject also need confirm persistent nasal SA carrier ( n = 48 ) . ( Persistent SA carriage define 3 separate , SA positive culture nasal swab : first take Pre-Screening 12 week ( 84 day ) . Administration last five day , three time day Day 1 , twice day thereafter . Primary objective establish safety tolerability two concentration modify thinner , low viscosity nasal formulation XF-73 compare previously investigate , thicker , high viscosity formulation . Secondary objective establish whether potential systemic exposure follow administration two nasal formulation XF-73 evaluate anti-staphylococcal efficacy two concentration low one thicker , high viscosity nasal formulation XF-73 .</detailed_description>
