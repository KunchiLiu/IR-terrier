	<brief_summary>Patients HER2/neu express solid tumor progress standard therapy treat call trifunctional antibody ( Ertumaxomab ) . The main objective trial find maximum tolerate dose . Tolerability Safety assess well efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label , Dose Escalating Study With Ertumaxomab In Patients With HER-2/Neu Expressing Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase I/II study dose escalate study investigate safety , tolerability , preliminary efficacy trifunctional anti-HER2/neu x anti-CD3 antibody ertumaxomab patient HER2/neu ( 1+/SISH positive , 2+ 3+ ) express solid tumor progress standard therapy . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability ertumaxomab order determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish recommend dose ( RD ) development . A maximum ten infusion applicated . Patients see baseline/screening , weekly infusion safety assessment break 3 week 5th dose . Radiological tumor assessment perform every 6 week . Post-study follow-up complete every 8 week one year .</detailed_description>
