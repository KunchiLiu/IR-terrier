	<brief_title>Minerva Pivotal Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Aurora Endometrial Ablation System Compared Hysteroscopic Rollerball Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menorrhagia define menstrual bleeding ovulatory woman exceed 80 ml per month . Approximately 20-25 % healthy premenopausal woman abnormal uterine bleeding . Menorrhagia negative impact woman 's lifestyle self-perception , often lead seek definitive treatment . Pharmacologic treatment menorrhagia always successful , dilatation curettage typically provide relief menstrual cycle . Traditionally hysterectomy definitive treatment menorrhagia . This clinical study evaluate safety effectiveness Aurora Endometrial Ablation System provide therapeutic treatment menorrhagia due benign cause ablate endometrial line uterus pre-menopausal woman childbearing complete . Subjects randomize control group receive hysteroscopic rollerball/resection ablation . Subjects randomized test arm treat Aurora Endometrial Ablation System .</detailed_description>
