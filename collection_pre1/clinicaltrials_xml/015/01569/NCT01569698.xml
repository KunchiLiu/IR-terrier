	<brief_summary>Limited prospective data available compare morbidity mortality renal replacement modality pediatric acute renal failure . In absence clear standard care , choice extra renal replacement therapy modality subject clinical judgement , practical aspect , cost . This study supply important data usual modality pediatric acute extra renal replacement therapy impact patient outcome renal recovery . An obvious next step conduct randomize control trial compare different strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In child , limit data extra renal replacement therapy . Pediatric study often retrospective , often limit specific disease process specific extra renal therapy . The lack large study include different usual modality pediatrics limit formal recommendation use relation patient outcome , include renal recovery mortality . Some issue need consideration choice dialysis modality ( include Intermittent Hemodialysis , Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies , Peritoneal Dialysis ) , indication time dialysis intervention , dose dialysis effect outcomes acute kidney injury child . This study supply important data pediatric acute extra renal replacement therapy , include epidemiology pediatric acute kidney injury lead extra renal replacement therapy , variety treatment modality , effect course disease .</detailed_description>
