	<brief_title>Low Intensity Physical Activity Leads Improvement Brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity Hemiplegics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurement aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) noninvasive method assess arterial stiffen atherosclerosis . In hemiplegic , disuse affect limb associate muscle waste lead development local atherosclerosis . The brachial-ankle aortic PWV ( baPWV ) indicator early stage disuse syndrome , measured device particularly useful elderly hemiplegic . The LIPA regime design result increase 3.3 % ( 40 kcal/day ) daily energy consumption compare individual baseline value . This include aerobic exercise half squat ( 70Â° knee flexion ) altogether 20 minute , daily . In addition , subject perform passive ankle dorsiflexion-plantar flexion , 30 times/minute 10 min , daily . The LIPA aim affect passive range motion ankle , knee , hip , weight bearing affected leg stand position .</detailed_description>
