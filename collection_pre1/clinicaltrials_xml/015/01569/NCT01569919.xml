	<brief_summary>This study patient malignant mesothelioma lung lining ( call pleura ) plan pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy . We investigate whether give vaccine call TroVax® pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy safe potentially beneficial patient mesothelioma . This vaccine use combination chemotherapy type cancer show safe . Cancer vaccines work stimulate person 's immune system fight disease , similar way immune system fight infection . In laboratory experiment , vaccine show stimulate immune response particular protein widely find mesothelioma cell call 5T4 . In patient mesothelioma hoped vaccine stimulate immune system attack mesothelioma cell carry 5T4 protein . Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy currently see best treatment patient mesothelioma , plan combine vaccine . It hop combination TroVax® vaccine chemotherapy beneficial chemotherapy alone . Pemetrexed-cisplatin give vein arm ( intravenously ) every 3 week . The TroVax® vaccine give injection shoulder muscle ( intramuscularly ) 3 week chemotherapy start , one week chemotherapy start , every 3 week . Each participant receive 4 chemotherapy 9 vaccine treatment complete plan trial schedule . We aim recruit 26 patient trial two year period . If study show pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy plus TroVax® vaccine safe beneficial term stimulate immune system , combination test large clinical trial .</brief_summary>
