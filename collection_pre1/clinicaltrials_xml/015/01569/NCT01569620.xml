	<detailed_description>CRC 2nd lead cause cancer death among Hispanic woman men . Hispanics likely diagnose advanced disease stage compare non-Hispanic white low probability survival . A key way decrease mortality CRC among Hispanics increase rate CRC screen thereby early detection CRC . To address low screen rate , thereby increase prevention early detection CRC , propose research seek increase CRC colonoscopy screen among Hispanics . The primary aim investigate impact culturally target print educational intervention design increase CRC screen via colonoscopy diverse group Hispanics 50 year age older . Our long standing ( since 1999 ) research platform include significant community input ongoing meeting Community Advisory Board ( CAB ) solicit viewpoint concern . In addition , consult key community member ongoing basis additional input . A Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) conduct 400 Hispanics within context best clinical practice currently provide Mount Sinai . There three study arm : 1 ) best clinical practice plus culturally relevant print material , 2 ) best clinical practice plus standard print material 3 ) best clinical practice alone . These three arm allow investigation addition print material comparison culturally relevant standard print material assess differential impact print format . This comparison control possible benefit add standard print material best clinical practice allow investigation additional benefit culturally target relevant material standard material . Further , include feedback community , able clearly understand benefit , able disseminate culturally targeted material among rapidly grow minority group . If , hypothesize , addition culturally target print material lead high rate colonoscopy , easily disseminate among health care setting treat Hispanics .</detailed_description>
