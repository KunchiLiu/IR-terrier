	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause morbidity U.S. identification treatment strategy improve outcome limited incomplete understand mechanisms recovery . M1 reorganization play major-role recovery motor deficits post-stroke ; hence importance development rehabilitative strategy utilize potential recovery . Non-invasive cortical stimulation enhance beneficial effect motor training performance functional plasticity motor cortex . Among different approach use study , Hebbian-type M1 stimulation particularly intriguing , seem effective compare random M1 stimulation . There emerge evidence motor train cortical stimulation relate improvement function associate increase grey matter target brain area . While therefore evidence support structural reorganization human M1 response motor learn cortical stimulation , mechanism underlying change relationship functional plasticity know . A good understanding sequence event critical development optimal therapeutic intervention improve recovery follow stroke . In Specific Aim 1 , determine repeat exposure training combine Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhance functional M1 reorganization lesioned M1 stroke patient . In Specific Aim 2 , determine repeat exposure training combine Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhance structural cortical reorganization lesioned M1 stroke patient explore whether structural change relate training induced functional cortical reorganization . At completion project , expectation determine effect Hebbian- type stimulation , functional structural brain reorganization , thereby obtain indirect evidence neuronal substrate underlie training related improvement maintenance motor function stroke patient . This knowledge would expect substantial positive impact treatment stroke patient significantly improve recovery would move field neurorehabilitation forward .</brief_summary>
