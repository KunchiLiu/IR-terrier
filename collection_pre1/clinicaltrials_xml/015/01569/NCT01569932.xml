	<brief_summary>This study document cognitive ( mental ) functional ability newly diagnose cancer patient . The study also examine change cognitive functional ability chemotherapy ( cancer treatment ) . A comprehensive set questionnaire task , assessment , put together order doctor nurse learn day day function newly diagnose adult cancer patient . The investigator would also like follow adult patient , follow completion cancer treatment , learn kind treatment receive cognitive status level participation activity daily live change . With follow-up assessment , doctor nurse learn complication health problem adult patient may experience result undergo cancer therapy . This study involve two visit . The first visit occurs within two week start cancer therapy , specifically chemotherapy . The second visit occurs within two week complete chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy increasingly use management various cancer . There report literature chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment range deficit memory attention slow information-processing deficiency executive function , include plan problem-solving . These deficit show affect work-place productivity social role-functioning present significant public health risk era increase chemotherapy usage . However , previous study investigate cognitive deficit chemotherapy mainly use neurocognitive assessment , limited utility clinical diagnosis due likelihood practice effect low sensitivity detect subtle cognitive change may functionally relevant patient . Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ( fcMRI ) sensitive test measure resting-state neural network connectivity , reflect integrity functionally-related brain region . fcMRI use delineate cortical neural network involve variety cognitive domain , include memory , attention . The investigator believe fcMRI sensitive neurocognitive test alone investigate chemotherapy-induced cognitive change . The goal novel study use fcMRI investigate cognitive change chemotherapy attempt understand currently unknown neurobiological mechanism associate phenomenon . This prospective study investigate presence cognitive deficit chemotherapy cancer patient assess change three fcMRI-defined neural network involve cognition . The three network include ( 1 ) Dorsal Frontal Attention network ( 2 ) `` Default '' network ( 3 ) Cognition `` Core '' control network . Sixteen cancer patient schedule chemotherapy undergo fcMRI brain neurocognitive test within two week chemotherapy . Comparisons time-points establish effect chemotherapy cognition . Results obtain study cancer patient provide insight mechanism underlie development chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficit . Knowledge development chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficit enhance positive outcome allow practitioner patient well informed potential cognitive consequence anticipate . With patient equip information start cancer treatment , well able manage affair daily activity way allow maintain productive living course cancer treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must 40 year age old Subjects must able read , write speak English fluently Treatment chemotherapy regimen contain 5fluorouracil platinumbased drug . Breast cancer subject must newly diagnose invasive lobular ductal cancer ( stage II III ) Head Neck cancer subject must newly diagnose locallyadvanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck oropharyngeal , hypopharyngeal laryngeal site ( stage III IV ) Ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer subject must newly diagnose epithelial ovarian cancer ( stage II IV ) , fallopian tube cancer pelvic extension ( stage IIIV ) , primary peritoneal cancer ( stage IIIIV ) Bladder , renal pelvis , ureteral cancer subject must newlydiagnosed muscleinvasive cancer ( stage II IV ) . Urethral cancer subject must newly diagnose cancer invade corpus spongiosum , prostate , periurethral muscle ( stage IIIV ) Subjects must anticipate receive chemotherapy without concomitant treatment use hormonal therapy immunomodulators . Subjects prior cancer diagnose evidence active disease Subjects receive chemotherapy radiation treatment within past year ( disease state ) Subjects melanoma nonsquamous cell carcinoma head neck Subjects nasopharyngeal , sinonasal lateral skull base tumor . Unintentional cranial irradiation occur treatment site could therefore completely eliminate associate cognitive deficit observe . Subjects implant nonMRI compatible metal object , electrode , pacemaker , intracardiac line , medication pump Subjects weight 350 pound ( weight limit MRI machine ) Subjects history claustrophobia Subjects inability lie flat 20 minute ( fcMRI scan ) Life expectancy le 6 month Any medical condition Principal Investigator ( PI ) determines would make study safe best interest potential subject participate . Subjects receive hormonal therapy therapy immunomodulators part cancer therapy .</criteria>
