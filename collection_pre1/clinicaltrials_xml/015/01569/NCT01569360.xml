	<brief_summary>Corsets often use management patient spinal cord injury . They may help rigidify patient ' trunk might help patient sit upright ; use may also reduce sensation dyspnea patient sit upright . Due spinal cord injury , abdominal muscle weaken contribute alter respiratory function patient . But corset rigidify abdominal wall improve efficiency respiratory muscle patient reduce dyspnea sit position patient . However , patient spinal cord injury follow time , one observe patient discontinue corset use . The investigator observe patient pursue corset use still significant improvement respiratory function corset patient discontinue use improved respiratory function upright position ( without corset ) . As , investigator know whether use corset discontinue spontaneous improvement respiratory function whether discontinue use corset may help develop abdominal spasticity therefore improve respiratory function . The investigator seek investigate issue order optimize management patient present spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Impact Use Corset Respiratory Function Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corsets widely use management spinal cord injury ( SCI ) patient . Their use provide certain amount rigidity trunk may help patient maintain posture ; also may contribute use combination contention reduce orthostatic hypotension . Last , may reduce dyspnea improve respiratory tolerance sit . Indeed , patient recent SCI worsen respiratory function sit position secondary hypotonia abdominal muscle place diaphragm low less efficient position . The use corset rigidifies abdominal wall therefore improve diaphragm contraction 's efficiency lead improvement vital capacity ( VC ) reduction dyspnea sit position . But although patient continue use corset overtime , others discontinue use . We recently observe corset user present improvement VC corset use proportional improvement VC observe supine position patient discontinue use exhibit reduction VC supine upright position suggest presented rigid abdominal wall . It know whether corset use discontinuation result spontaneous improvement respiratory function upright position lead appearance abdominal spasticity improvement respiratory function . Therefore , aim study effect long term corset use SCI patient ' respiratory function . We conduct monocentric prospective open study 56 SCI patient ( SCI level range C5 T8 ASIA A B ) recent lesion ( &lt; 4 month ) . The evolution respiratory function dyspnea without corset use study 2 year period . An evaluation spasticity overtime also conduct . After randomization ( corset use ) evaluation conduct 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year include : pulmonary function test without corset upright position supine position , blood gas , dyspnea score different position spasticity assessment .</detailed_description>
