	<brief_summary>The primary aim study examine physical activity level patient bronchiectasis . Subsidiary aim : 1 . To examine whether relationship physical activity level patient bronchiectasis clinical phenotype ( disease severity , exercise capacity , quality life symptom disease ) . The investigator also want explore relationship physical activity level readiness change physical activity behaviour ( stage change , self-efficacy , decisional balance process change ) . 2 . To assess feasibility acceptability physical activity assessment tool : ActiGraph , ActivPAL , pedometer International Physical Activity Questionnaire . Hypothesis : Patients bronchiectasis low level physical activity , related clinical phenotype ( disease severity , exercise capacity , quality life symptom disease ) also readiness change physical activity behaviour ( stage change , self-efficacy , process change decisional balance ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis presence abnormal , irreversibly dilate , thick wall bronchus cause cystic fibrosis . Promoting physical activity decrease inactivity ( e.g . sedentary period activity sitting/lying ) propose key component care chronic disease research physical activity bronchiectasis . There research describe physical activity respiratory population , however , disease trajectory demographic profile bronchiectasis sufficiently different warrant propose research specifically bronchiectasis The investigator need explore physical activity bronchiectasis also provide specific information instrument use measure physical activity . There several method could use assess physical activity include subjective method ( e.g . questionnaire ) , objective method ( e.g . motion sensor ) . In study investigator use range assessment tool help determine usefulness ( feasibility acceptability health professional patient perspective ) quantify physical activity bronchiectasis . This study also assess patient ' readiness change ( stage change , self efficacy , decisional balance process change ) . Understanding patient bronchiectasis readiness change physical activity behaviour link important outcome measure help inform future physical activity intervention specifically patient bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
