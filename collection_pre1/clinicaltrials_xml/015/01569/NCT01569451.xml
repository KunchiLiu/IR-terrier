	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) determine rituximab induction therapy follow glatiramer acetate ( GA ) substantially superior placebo induction follow GA treatment clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) relapse form multiple sclerosis ( RMS ) ( 2 ) explore change lymphocyte population CNS consequence treatment rituximab follow chronic GA therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double blind , active comparator ; single-center study involve 90 subject qualify CIS RMS . Subjects screen-failures must randomize within 60 day sign informed consent document . Subjects randomize within 60 day must re-screened enrollment study . Patients stratify base diagnosis CIS RMS ( Relapsing Remitting Secondary Progressive ) randomly assign 1:1 ratio either rituximab induction follow standard GA therapy ( R-GA arm ) , placebo induction follow standard GA therapy ( GA arm ) . Subjects receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion 1000 mg rituximab placebo ( normal saline ) study day 1 ( baseline visit ) 15 accord rituximab infusion protocol ( Appendix C ) . On study day 28 , subject initiate standard GA therapy , 20 mg inject subcutaneously daily . Study visit include screen , baseline/randomization ( day 1 ) , day 15 , day 28 visit every 3 month 2.5 year . A month define 28 day . On study day 15 , patient receive second dose either rituximab placebo ; study day 28 patient begin treatment GA therapy . Study day 15 28 acceptable window +/- 4 day . Follow-up phone call conduct every month assess adverse event relapse . All monthly phone call quarterly visit must occur +/- 7 day window . Unscheduled office visit evaluation symptom suggestive relapse schedule need may prompt question elicit monthly safety relapse assessment phone call , basis phone call initiate patient . In either case , handle phone call interview patient accord question describe Appendix D PDDS administer . If subject report new worsen symptoms one point change PDDS score , unscheduled visit necessary . The examine clinician administer Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) blind PDDS score type visit ( unscheduled schedule ) . The treat clinician determine neurological change consider relapse base EDSS score provide EDSS evaluator clinical presentation , make decision whether corticosteroid administer treatment relapse . In addition , patient whose EDSS score change sufficiently qualify SAD either schedule unscheduled visit , ask come additional visit , 12 week later , determine whether change sustain . A sub-group patient provide informed consent enrol Lumbar Puncture procedure . The procedure perform begin study 6 month visit . The objective examine change CSF T B cell correlate evidence disease activity relapse , new MRI lesion and/or SAD . This procedure optional patient impact overall study . Patients decide participate sign Addendum Optional Procedure Consent Form The primary endpoint number disease-free patient , define patient without new lesion brain MRI use combine unique lesion approach ( CUL ) , without sustain change EDSS score 3-month period without relapse . Once last patient randomize complete final study visit year 1 study , data lock analysis perform data collect point . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meet initiation study every 6 month thereafter end study . Members DSMB may unblind discretion DSMB include statistician directly involve study . If induction therapy fail show superiority point , study stop . Standardized brain MRIs without gadolinium contrast obtain baseline , month 6 , 12 , 18 24 month ( patient reach point prior last enrolled patient reach 12 month follow-up visit ) UCD Anschutz Medical Campus . The treat clinician access MRI discus result openly subject . Standardized MRIs obtain interpret locally physician blind subject treatment record endpoints describe . Assessments perform accord schedule event section 4.1 . Blinded examiner utilized EDSS , MSFC low contrast visual acuity assessment . Lab result B cell CD19+ count collect blind study coordinator review monthly basis qualify member DSMB safety assessment . But CD19 B cell count available treat clinician unless need safety . The treat clinician study coordinator manage clinical care study relate procedure . Complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) liver function test ( LFT ) obtain year Standard Care , often deem necessary treating clinician . Complete blood count ( CBC ) differential CD19+ lab collect Baseline , month 1 every 3 month baseline monitor B cell recovery . The examine clinician primary study coordinator blind CD19 lab result .</detailed_description>
