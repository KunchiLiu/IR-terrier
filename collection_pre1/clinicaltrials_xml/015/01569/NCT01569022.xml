	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance cardinal feature Veterans post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . In particular , obstructive sleep apnea report occur frequently patient PTSD compare without PTSD contribute worsen cognitive behavioral function . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) consider treatment choice OSA adherence CPAP Veterans PTSD poor compare general population . The propose study aim compare efficacy , tolerability , adherence oral appliances-an alternative therapy OSA- CPAP . The study instrumental identify optimal OSA therapy Veterans PTSD OSA phenotype would predict oral appliance response</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Cross Over Trial Two Treatments Sleep Apnea Veterans With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent disorder associate poor neurocognitive performance organ system dysfunction due intermittent hypoxia repeat arousal . The repetitive hemodynamic stress implicate increased incidence systemic hypertension cardiovascular disease . Insufficient disrupt sleep similar negative impact mood , attention , cognition , behavior . In Veterans post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , disturbed sleep worsen cognitive-behavioral manifestation PTSD contribute poor mental physical health outcome . Recent epidemiologic study largely support association high rate OSA patient PTSD compare general population . Treatment underlie obstructive sleep disturbance continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) result restoration sleep architecture , decrease daytime sleepiness , reduction nightmare frequency intensity . However , adherence treatment CPAP le optimal Veterans PTSD . Mandibular advance device ( MADs ) consider non surgical alternative CPAP prefer head head comparison CPAP OSA subject without PTSD . However , study investigator ' knowledge assess MAD term clinical efficacy , compliance , quality sleep compare CPAP OSA patient PTSD . Therefore , investigator hypothesize MAD inferior CPAP treat OSA effectively Veterans PTSD OSA . To end , investigator propose conduct feasibility study use randomize crossover trial 12 week CPAP MAD 42 consecutive outpatient PTSD newly diagnose OSA separate 2 week washout period . The primary endpoint trial compare treatment efficacy CPAP MAD Veterans PTSD OSA . Secondary endpoint aim : 1 ) compare change Epworth Sleepiness Scale , SF-36 , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index end treatment follow use CPAP versus MAD , 2 ) compare adherence short-term side effect use CPAP MAD PTSD patient OSA , 3 ) determine anthropomorphic , polysomnographic , cephalometric predictor successful MDA response . Assessments end limbs comprise evaluation quality sleep , daytime sleepiness , quality life , side effect treatment . Compliance therapy measure end treatment period . The result trial pivotal determine efficacy , tolerability , adherence MAD compare CPAP Veterans PTSD OSA . This feasibility study would form basis future trial examine effectiveness various therapeutic modality OSA PTSD symptomatology progression .</detailed_description>
