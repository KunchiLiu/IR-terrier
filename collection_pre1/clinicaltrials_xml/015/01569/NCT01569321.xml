	<brief_summary>Breast cancer first cancer woman , second etiology death cancer first cause woman 35 55 year . Diagnostic tool large screen realize positive impact recent review 31 % le likely die breast cancer nearly 30 year compare woman n't get regular screening mammogram . Diagnostic tool treatment also improve continuously . However , woman , breast cancer diagnosis difficult , case high density breast , breast modification surgery… In case , breast MRI currently best image tool , high sensitivity 90 % low specificity 60 % , lead futile biopsy . Recently , molecular image PET-CT scan 18FDG permit widely modify cancer treatment . However , PET-CT scan good imaging tool initial diagnostic breast tumor lack spatial resolution 8mm . So , researcher develop dedicate PET scan breast , call Positron Emission Mammography . Our project field view name CLEARPEMSONIC . First clinical study PEM show good performance image modality initial evaluation breast tumor . PEM performance affect breast density , hormonal status . Spatial resolution less 3mm . PEM seem complementary MRI , add good specificity value . In field CERIMED , ClearPemSonic Project aim evaluate new image tool combine PEM scan ultrasonography . Technologic evaluation make . Now feasibility study first step clinical application . The main objective project confirm feasibility PEM scan ClearPEmSonic . Secondary objective compare result conventional imaging modality MRI . The gold standard histology breast tumor .</brief_summary>
