	<brief_summary>Background : The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) cause number cancer , include cervical throat cancer . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 200 patient melanoma . Researchers want know TIL shrink tumor people human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -related cancer . In study , select specific subset white blood cell tumor think effective fighting tumor use cell make tumor fight cell . Objective : The purpose study see specifically select tumor fight cell cause HPV-related cancer shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-66 HPV-related cancer tumor safely remove . Design : Work stage : Patients see outpatient National Institutes Health ( NIH ) clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need . Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Metastatic locally advance refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -associated malignancy ( cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal , oropharyngeal ) incurable poorly palliate standard therapy . - Administration autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) generate resect metastatic melanoma induce objective long-term tumor response . - Young TIL generate HPV-associated tumor . Objectives : - To determine autologous Young TIL infused conjunction high dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen mediate tumor regression patient metastatic locally advanced refractory/recurrent HPV-associated cancer . - To study immunologic correlate associate Young TIL therapy HPV-associated cancer . - To determine toxicity treatment regimen . Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm diagnosis metastatic locally advanced refractory/recurrent HIPV-16+ HPV-18+ human papillomavirus-associated cancer . Design : - Patients undergo biopsy resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture autologous cancer cell line . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day intravenous ( IV ) ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV ) day -5 -1 . - On day 0 patient receive 1 time 10 ( 9 ) 2 time 10 ( 11 ) young TIL begin high dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . - Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . - Initially , 18 evaluable patient enrol two cohort ; patient cervical cancer non- cervical cancer . For cohort , 0 2 18 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol . If 3 first 18 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 35 evaluable patient enrol cohort . Up 73 patient may enrol approximately 3-4 year .</detailed_description>
