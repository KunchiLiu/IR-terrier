	<brief_summary>This project compare Family History Positive ( FHP ) alcoholism subject match Family History Negative ( FHN ) subject derive project Principal Investigator 's National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism-funded longitudinal study drink behavior 2000 college freshman population ( know Brain Alcohol Research College Students study ( BARCS ) ) . The age subject valuable one capture transition harmful use abuse/dependence . This project explore effect memantine double-blind , randomize , counterbalance manner alcoholism risk-relevant task . More specifically , project study functional MRI task related different aspect reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior different context , compare underlie neural circuitry across task , use pharmacologic probe glutamatergic system examine NMDA/DA interaction . The combined measure provide opportunity advance understand specific aspect brain function relate familial alcoholism vulnerability already well-characterized population member evolve alcohol abuse . In addition conventional within-task analysis , functional network connectivity ally approach use examine brain network across task . The investigator study adult male female subject equal number either offspring alcoholic parent FHN match control . The investigator recruit assess total 84 ( 42 FHP 42 match FHN ) subject ages 18-21 year initial BARCS contact . The investigator use 4 cognitive task functional MRI ( fMRI ) include : 1 ) Monetary Incentive Delay Task distinguish network engage motivational ( anticipation ) consummatory ( outcome ) components reward processing ; 2 ) Go/No-Go Task measure ability inhibit response pre-potent stimulus ; 3 ) Alcohol Cue Reactivity Task examine Nucleus Accumbens response alcohol-related versus match soft drink stimulus ; 4 ) Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer ( PIT ) Task dissect component Monetary Incentive Delay ( MID ) Task , provide image assay transfer-like process relate real-world drinking behavior , thus inform upon extend key finding CTNA-2 .</brief_summary>
