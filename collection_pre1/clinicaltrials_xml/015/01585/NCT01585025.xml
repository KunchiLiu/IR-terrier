	<brief_summary>The investigator propose develop study obeticholic acid ( OCA ) patient bile acid diarrhoea . OCA semisynthetic bile acid , also know 6αethylchenodeoxycholic acid INT747 , potent farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) agonist . Preliminary data suggest patient bile acid diarrhoea impaired production ileal hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 ( FGF19 ) . FGF19 stimulate FXR agonist , regulates bile acid synthesis . This study pilot , proof-of-concept , open-label study investigate whether OCA stimulate FGF19 bile acid diarrhoea patient provide safe effective treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bile acid diarrhoea ( BAD ) under-recognised common condition chronic watery diarrhoea . BAD may secondary ileal disease affect reabsorption enterohepatic circulation bile acid ( bile acid malabsorption ) idiopathic , primary BAD ( PBAD ) . In work publish 2009 , describe new mechanism explain syndrome primary BAD . Blood level hormone fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) reduce primary secondary BAD , produce impaired feedback inhibition bile acid synthesis , lead excess faecal bile acid , produce diarrhoea stimulate colonic secretion . FGF19 synthesise ileum show transcription markedly induce farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) agonists chenodeoxycholic acid , abundant natural bile acid . More potent FXR agonists logical diagnostic therapeutic agent condition , obeticholic acid ( OCA ) , 100x potent chenodeoxycholic acid , recently develop . It use phase II study primary biliary cirrhosis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis relatively common side-effect constipation . We aim investigate effect OCA patient primary secondary BAD determine whether FGF19 able stimulate condition . We compare response control patient chronic diarrhoea without evidence BAD . It possible BAD defect FGF19 level due inability respond FXR stimulation ( particularly likely secondary BAD ileal resection ) . Patients primary BAD may able respond benefit increase FGF19 level . This study aim obtain pilot data effect OCA FGF19 , marker bile acid metabolism patient symptom include diarrhoea . These early phase II , proof concept study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients age 18 80 present routine Gastrointestinal Outpatient Clinics Hammersmith Charing Cross Hospitals chronic diarrhoea , define average stool frequency least three per day , Bristol Stool Type 6 7 , least 3 month . Previous routine SeHCAT test establish presence absence bile acid diarrhoea ( BAD ) unless evidence TI disease/ resection . BAD define SeHCAT 7day retention less 15 % diarrhoea presence TI disease/ resection . Study subject group secondary BAD , due ileal resection Crohn 's disease , primary BAD , obvious cause . The third , control group chronic diarrhoea normal SeHCAT retention ( great 15 % ) . Female patient must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , premenopausal , prepare use ≥ 1 effective ( ≤ 1 % failure rate ) method contraception trial 15 day last dose OCA . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must use ≥ 1 effective method contraception . Effective method contraception consider : 1 . Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . 4 . Male sterilisation ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . 5 . True abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Exclusion Criteria Patients diagnose lead diarrhoea , include colorectal neoplasia , ulcerative colitis , coeliac disease , chronic pancreatitis , druginduced diarrhoea active infection . Patients investigated standard clinical assessment exclude disorder . Treatment bile acid sequestrants ( colestyramine , colestipol , colesevelam ) 2 week first dose OCA . Loperamide use allow 16mg/d divided dos . Previous biliary surgery , exclude cholecystectomy . Abnormal bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase 1 occasion . Chronic liver disease Chronic kidney disease Active , serious medical disease likely life expectancy le 5 year Active substance abuse include inhale injection drug year prior screen Allergy obeticholic acid . Pregnancy , plan pregnancy , potential pregnancy unwillingness use effective birth control trial , breast feeding . Pregnancy assess urinary βhCG pregnancy test . Participation investigational new drug trial 30 day randomisation Any condition , opinion investigator , would impede compliance hinder completion study Failure give inform consent</criteria>
