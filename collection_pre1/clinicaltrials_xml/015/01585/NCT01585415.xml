	<brief_summary>Background : - One possible treatment advance melanoma involves collect white blood cell person cancer grow laboratory . The cell give back donor . This study use white blood cell treatment cancer treatment drug vemurafenib . Vemurafenib target melanoma cell mutation B-raf gene , may able make shrink . Objectives : - To see vemurafenib white blood cell therapy safe effective treatment advance melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year less equal 66 year age advance melanoma contains B-raf genetic mutation . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - White blood cell collect tumor cell . These cell collect surgery tumor biopsy . - Participants leukapheresis collect additional white blood cell procedure . - Participants take vemurafenib twice day , start 3 week receive white blood cell . - Participants 1 week chemotherapy prepare immune system accept white blood cell . - Participants receive infusion collect white blood cell . They also receive aldesleukin 5 day boost immune system response white blood cell . They remain hospital recovered treatment . - Participants frequent follow-up visit monitor outcome treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer autologous patient along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . Vemurafenib ( VEM ) administration show mediate objective response 50-60 percent patient metastatic melanoma bear BRAF mutation though many response transient . There several reason suggest combination ACT VEM synergize destruction melanoma include 1 ) rapid tumor destruction VEM may provide vaccine-like stimulus transfer TIL ; 2 ) VEM show upregulate expression melanoma antigens ; 3 ) VEM may make residual melanoma cell sensitive immune damage . Objectives : The primary objective determine safety administration vemurafenib conjunction ACT consist autologous TIL infuse along high dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen . The secondary objective : - To gain preliminary information concern ability combination therapy mediate clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - To study immunologic impact VEM administration lymphoid infiltrate melanoma deposit . Eligibility : Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm diagnosis metastatic melanoma express VtoE BRAF mutation VtoK BRAF mutation . Patients measurable disease , absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . No serious comorbid condition active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system . Design : Patients undergo biopsy resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture . When cryopreserved TIL available patient begin administration VEM 960 mg ( day 1 ) twice daily disease progression patient take protocol . On day -7 , patient begin non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day IV ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m2/day IV ) day -5 -1 . On day 0 , patient receive 1x109 2x1011 young TIL begin high dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week last dose aldesleukin . This pilot trial accrue 25 patient .</detailed_description>

Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl Platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) 11 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , hepatitis C antibody antigen . 12 . Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less three time upper limit normal . Calculated creatinine clearance ( eGFR ) &gt; 50 ml/min . Total bilirubin less equal 2 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3 mg/dl . 13 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time treatment , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must stable progress disease prior treatment . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion Section 2.1.1 . 14 . Six week must elapse time antibody therapy could affect anti cancer immune response , include antiCTLA4 antibody therapy time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . Note : Patients previously receive ipilimumab document GI toxicity must normal colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . 15 . EKG mean QTc interval &lt; 450 msec . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Prior cell transfer therapy include myeloablative chemotherapy regimen ( i.e . 1200 TBI 200 TBI plus chemotherapy ) . 2 . Previous treatment Vemurafenib . 3 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 4 . Systemic steroid therapy requirement . 5 .
