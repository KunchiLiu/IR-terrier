	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial design compare susceptibility naive pre-immune volunteer infectious challenge viable Plasmodium vivax sporozoite . The term preimmune hereafter denote previous experience infection parasite definite state immunity malaria infection . The study hypothesis pre-immune volunteer present delayed onset malaria clinical parasitological manifestation compare naive individual . The development study establish protocol evaluate effectiveness vaccine candidate P. vivax subsequent Phases IIa IIb clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exposure Naive Pre-immune Subjects P. Vivax Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective control , blind clinical trial , design establish difference infectivity infectious challenge P. vivax sporozoites human volunteer without history malaria . Study subject This study require involvement two type volunteer : - Parasite donor : 5-15 P. vivax-infected patient serve parasite donor experimental infection mosquito , enrol endemic area . - Volunteers infectious challenge Two group volunteer expose mosquito infect P. vivax sporozoite . A group 7 people without previous exposure malaria ( naive ) another 12 people history previous malaria infection ( pre-immune ) . Methodology - Recruitment infected patient Parasite donor recruit among P. vivax infect patient attend diagnostic center endemic area . - Infection mosquito Blood donor use feed three day old mosquito artificial membrane feeding technique . At day 7 sample mosquito examine determine degree infection dissection mosquito gut . On day 14 , small amount mosquito good degree infectivity use infect challenge volunteer . - Recruitment pre-immune naive volunteer Volunteers challenge recruit city Cali , non-endemic region , Buenaventura , malaria endemic region , various activity conference , meeting mean approved IRB like poster flyer . Infection volunteer The `` feeding cage '' place forearm volunteer 10 minute , allow feed window , wich cover mesh surface place volunteer 's skin . Follow Up Volunteers educate sign symptom malaria daily telephone contact first 6 day . Between day 7 23 volunteer ask go Clinical Trials Unit daily order establish presence absence disease thick blood smear sample collect retrospective real time PCR P. vivax . From day 23 day 31 , volunteer receive physical laboratory evaluation every day daily telephone contact . Once patient present sign symptom disease curative treatment immediately provide , 15 ml blood drawn , use immune response assessment . If volunteer develop disease follow-up period , day 31 give antimalarial treatment . Treatment Volunteers treat antimalarial drug approve Colombian Ministry Social Protection : chloroquine ( three ( 3 ) dos : 600 mg initially , follow 450mg 24 , 48 hour ) , associate primaquine ( 30mg/d√≠a ) 14 day . All volunteer ask return two week start treatment thick blood smear test ensure cure malaria .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Step 1 : Age 15 60 year . Hemoglobin level &gt; 9g/dL . Presence Current P. vivax infection . Absence Plasmodium specie determine thick blood smear PCR . Blood parasite count 0.1 % . Absence acute chronic disease . Being able sign inform consent form . 2 . Step 2 : Healthy 18 45 year old man nonpregnant woman . To capacity sign inform consent free voluntary way . To acceptable understanding clinical trial approval questionnaire regard information give consent process . Obligatory use adequate contraceptive method begin recruitment screening time three month last immunization . Do chronic acute disease . These condition determine clinical history , physical exam laboratory test . To accept travel malaria endemic area clinical trial To telephone home mobile phone permit permanent contact follow Being willing participate step clinical trial . 1 . Step 1 : history blood transfusion last six month . Pregnancy woman . Have receive antimalarial treatment diagnosis . 2 . Step 2 : Pregnant nursing woman . History moderate severe insect , food allergy . G6PD deficiency Hb genetic defect . Symptoms , sign data laboratory test suggest systemic disorder like renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , pulmonary , psychiatric disorder illness could interfere result clinical trial could compromise health volunteer . To antibody hepatitis C , VIH , hepatitis B superficial antigen and/or hepatitis B core antibody . To abnormality parameter assess blood laboratory test Presence history autoimmune disease . History surgical removal spleen ( splenectomy ) . Use medical treatment know alter immune system 3 month recruitment .</criteria>
