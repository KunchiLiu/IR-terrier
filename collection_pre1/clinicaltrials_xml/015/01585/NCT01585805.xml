	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well veliparib together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin work compare gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin alone treat patient pancreatic cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) spread primary site ( place start ) place body ( metastatic ) . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give veliparib together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin effective treatment pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To optimize dose veliparib combine fixed dos gemcitabine hydrochloride ( gemcitabine ) cisplatin ( non-randomized , lead-in portion Part I ) . II . To evaluate response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) gemcitabine , cisplatin , veliparib ( Arm A ) gemcitabine , cisplatin ( Arm B ) BRCA PALB2 mutation carrier advance pancreas adenocarcinoma . ( Part I ) III . To evaluate response rate ( RECIST criterion ) single-agent veliparib ( Arm C ) BRCA PALB2 carrier previously treat pancreas adenocarcinoma . ( Part II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival patient study Arm A Arm B . ( Part I ) II . To describe safety tolerability gemcitabine , cisplatin , veliparib gemcitabine cisplatin BRCA PALB2 carrier advance pancreas adenocarcinoma . ( Part I ) III . To determine disease control rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) duration response study Arm A Arm B . ( Part I ) IV . To evaluate overall survival study Arm A Arm B . ( Part I ) V. To evaluate progression-free survival single-agent veliparib BRCA PALB2 mutation carrier previously treat pancreas adenocarcinoma ( Arm C ) . ( Part II ) VI . To describe safety tolerability single-agent veliparib BRCA PALB2 mutation carrier previously treat pancreas adenocarcinoma . ( Part II ) VII . To determine disease control rate ( CR + PR + SD ) duration response Arm C. ( Part II ) VIII . To evaluate overall survival Arm C. ( Part II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine genotype BRCA1 , BRCA2 PALB2-mutated pancreas adenocarcinoma . II . To assess pre post therapy biopsy novel persistent genetic alteration gene identify aim I. III . To quantify level PAR peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor tissue sequential time point follow therapy veliparib . IV . To quantify level gammaH2AX RAD51 foci PBMCs tumor tissue ( available ) sequential time point assess formation double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) break , stalled/collapsed replication fork evaluate homologous recombination competence . V. To correlate result genotyping gene expression provide functional information mutation identify . ( Exploratory ) VI . An exploratory assessment differential expression gene involve DNA repair pathway pre post treatment identify candidate gene predictive response resistance therapy study preclinical model disease . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib follow randomize , open-label study . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-12 1-21 . Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute cisplatin IV 30 minute day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ( CLOSED AS OF 12/13/13 ) PART I : Once maximum-tolerated dose veliparib establish , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( prior therapy &gt; = 6 month since adjuvant therapy ) : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-12 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute cisplatin IV 30 minute day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( prior therapy &gt; = 6 month since adjuvant therapy ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV cisplatin IV patient arm A . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II : Patients eligible receive treatment Arm C. ARM C ( prior therapy ) : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
