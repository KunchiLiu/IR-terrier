	<brief_summary>The purpose trial assess effect two Intensive Outpatient Management Strategies ( IOMS ) versus Routine Care ( RC ) outcomes patient Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) treat adalimumab . This multi-center , randomize , control , parallel group , single ( patient ) blind trial . A total 300 patient ( 100 per group ) RA recruit approximately 40 site across Canada .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic systemic inflammatory disease often leading damage disability ( Lee DM , et al. ) . RA associate short life expectancy ( Pincus T , et al . ) , untreated , lead significantly low quality life functional impairment ( Bradley EM , et al. ) . The concept tight control , involve treatment patient specify target close monitor treatment adjustment necessary , trialed early RA . Many target study demonstrate improved outcome faster target achievement early RA . The TICORA trial , study group patient active disease progress multiple DMARDs biologic therapy , demonstrate usage intensive outpatient management strategy ( IOMS ) RA improve clinical outcome measure ( Grigor C , et al. ) . Indeed , result clinical trial show strict control intense follow , base titration treatment accordance standardize protocol , improved disease activity , physical function quality life patient without additional cost . The propose study evaluate application two type IOMS . The first IOMS consist titration treatment base attainment DAS28 score 2.4 ( DAS28-IOMS ) . The second IOMS consist titration treatment base attainment zero swollen joint ( 0SJ-IOMS ) ( 28 joint evaluate ) . Investigators aim achieve target within reasonable period time , i.e . first six month treatment adalimumab . In addition , investigator aim attain target within reasonable limit individual patient . The clinical impact two IOMS compare routine care ( RC ) . The result study significant implication individual subject also societal perspective since may enhance overall real-life effectiveness treatment identify best approach maximize benefit treatment HUMIRA® . Primary Objective : In patient RA initiate treatment adalimumab : - The primary aim current study assess effect two IOMS versus RC outcomes patient RA treat adalimumab . The secondary aim assess differential effect DAS28-IOMS 0SJ-IOMS patient population . Secondary Objectives : In patient RA initiate treatment adalimumab : - To compare therapeutic effectiveness DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC measure proportion subject achieve target score DAS28 . - To compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC patient subjective assessment functional status measure Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) . - To compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC patient ' perception disease evaluate Work Limitation Questionnaire ( WLQ ) . - To compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC patient ' satisfaction care evaluate change patient ' satisfaction measure Likert scale . - To compare therapeutic effectiveness DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC measure proportion subject achieve good moderate European League Rheumatism ( EULAR ) responses . - To compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC frequency serious adverse event protocol-specified adverse event . Tertiary Study Objectives : In patient RA initiate treatment adalimumab : - To compare therapeutic effectiveness DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC measure proportion subject achieve target score CDAI SDAI . - To describe impact individual component DAS28 clinical decision regard patient management . - To describe impact CDAI clinical decision regard patient management . - To describe impact SDAI clinical decision regard patient management . - To describe impact HAQ clinical decision regard patient management . - To describe compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC patient ' compliance treatment . - To describe compare impact DAS28-IOMS , 0SJ-IOMS RC change concomitant anti-rheumatic medication use .</detailed_description>
