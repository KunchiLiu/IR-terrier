	<detailed_description>Clinical Decision rule safely successfully allow clinician reduce total number radiograph order , detect patient important pathology injury . The Ottawa Ankle Knee Rules develop series study , successfully reduce number radiograph order physician without miss serious ankle fracture ( 1-4 ) . Likewise , NEXUS group develop clinical decision rule selection blunt trauma patient appropriate imaging , base clinical feature ( 5 ) . Drs . Hendey Emond separately develop similar algorithm selective radiography patient suspect shoulder dislocation ( 6-10 ) . The goal current study compare validate two clinical algorithm . Both approach examine clinical feature readily accessible physician time ED evaluation . In pre-reduction assessment , algorithm include mechanism injury whether patient experience previous shoulder dislocation . Hendey additionally assess whether physician clinically confident dislocation ( 8 ) . Emond additionally include age patient , presence absence humeral ecchymosis ( 9 ) . In post-reduction assessment , algorithms emphasize importance clinical certainty reduction , well presence fracture dislocation .</detailed_description>
