	<brief_summary>This phase IIIb study intend implement consistent treatment way switch Exelon transdermal patch oral formulation rivastigmine stress importance ( 1 ) advantage transdermal patch conventional oral therapy : smooth drug delivery reduce side effect ; ( 2 ) encourage treatment compliance Alzheimer 's dementia setting . This study single-arm , treatment-switched design . Eligible patient , Exelon capsule 3 mg b.i.d . treatment 4 week Visit 2 , recruit , follow treatment switch oral capsule patch 48 week maintenance treatment . During maintenance period , treatment initiate Exelon Patch 4.6 mg/24 hour ( Exelon Patch 5 cm^2 ) first 24 week dose escalate Exelon Patch 9.5 mg/24 hour ( Exelon Patch 10 cm^2 ) another 24 week well tolerate . Visits assess safety schedule baseline , 3 day , 1 week 2 week first treatment switch , every 4 week Week 40 , end study ( Week 52 ) . The assessment address primary objective focus safety treatment switch ( Week 0~28 ) ; however safety assessment perform whole study period .</brief_summary>

A clinical diagnosis probable AD accord NINCDS/ADRDA criterion . The brain scan ( magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) use establish criterion meet must available source document within one year prior study participation . Patients currently take plan receive Exelon 3 mg capsule twicedaily treatment . Written informed consent must obtain assessment perform . If female , must surgically sterile least one year postmenopausal . Sufficient education read , write , communicate effectively . Capable complying requirement study Any advance , severe unstable disease could interfere study evaluation completion put patient special risk .
