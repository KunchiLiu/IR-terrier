	<brief_title>Phase I Study AT13148 , Novel AGC Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AT13148 new drug look promise laboratory study . We wish find useful treat patient cancer . AT13148 type drug call protein kinase inhibitor . It block several different chemical messenger ( enzyme ) call AGC kinase protein . These chemical messenger part signal process within cell make cell produce chemical trigger control cell growth cell death . In type cancer chemical messenger 'switched ' 'switched ' permanently due change gene cell call `` gene mutation '' lead uncontrolled cancer cell growth . AT13148 target multiple protein kinase three family kinases unlike many protein kinase inhibitor currently test target one two kinase . This may mean work well wider group cancer patient . Patients select take part base gene mutation first trial want learn mutation important would hope future trial . The patient population anticipate benefit drug include certain type breast , prostate ovarian cancer commonly gene mutation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven advance solid tumour , refractory conventional treatment , conventional therapy exists decline patient . Paraffinembedded tumour tissue must available genetic mutation status test . 2 . Life expectancy least 12 week 3 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 , 1 2 4 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within 7 day first dose AT13148 take Day 7 4 . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 /L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Fasting glucose ≤ 7 mmol/L Either : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Or : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ( ULN ) unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Either : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Or : Isotope clearance measurement ≥ 50mL/min ( uncorrected ) 5 . Adequate lung function indicate rest oxygen saturation level ( air ) ≥ 94 % , COtransfer factor &gt; 60 % 6 . 18 year 7 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup 1 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy ( except luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists prostate cancer ) , immunotherapy chemotherapy previous four week ( six week nitrosoureas , MitomycinC ) 4 week investigational medicinal product ) treatment . 2 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator Drug Development Office ( DDO ) exclude patient . 3 . Symptomatic brain metastasis ( present must stable &gt; 3 month ) . 4 . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) study six month afterwards consider eligible . 5 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] study six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( e.g . condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 6 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 7 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 8 . Known serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . 9 . History autoimmune disease know allergy peanut . 10 . Concurrent hypotension define baseline supine blood pressure ( BP ) systolic &lt; 90 mmHg . 11 . Patients receive antihypertensive treatment treatment beta blocker ratelimiting calcium agent . A washout period 5 x half life drug apply follow withdrawal treatment . 12 . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] ) , prior history cardiac ischaemia prior history cardiac arrhythmia . Coronary angioplasty stenting previous 12 month . 13 . Patients know leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % . A multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) must perform patient . 14 . Concurrent diabetes require treatment ( dietcontrolled diabetes would acceptable ) . 15 . Prior bone marrow transplant extensive radiotherapy great 25 % bone marrow within eight week . 16 . A history underlie interstitial lung disease . 17 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical study . 18 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical study whilst take part study . Participation observational study would acceptable .</criteria>
