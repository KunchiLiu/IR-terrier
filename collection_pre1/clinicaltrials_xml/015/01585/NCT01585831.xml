	<brief_title>Study Psychological Motor Effects Testosterone Adolescents With XXY/Klinefelter Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Klinefelter syndrome ( 47 , XXY ) common chromosomal abnormality human occur approximately 1 650 male . Testosterone deficiency develop adolescence majority individual XXY . However , previous study evaluate psychological motor effect testosterone replacement therapy adolescent XXY . The study researcher interested learn testosterone therapy initiate early puberty XXY ( KS ) lead improvement psychological and/or motor skill . They also interest learning genetic variation androgen receptor gene parent-of-origin extra X chromosome influence response testosterone therapy . Specific psychological factor study include verbal nonverbal cognitive skill , attention , executive function ( organization , problem-solving skill , inhibition ) , anxiety , language , self-esteem , behavioral factor . Motor skill study include gross fine motor skill , motor coordination , motor planning . Participants study randomized one two treatment group , receive either testosterone gel placebo , 12 month . 60 % study group receive testosterone , 40 % receive placebo . The research participant , parents/caregivers , member study team blind treatment group , know whether receive testosterone gel placebo treatment . The supervise endocrinologist study blind know patient testosterone placebo group . This allow monitor result determine participant placebo group may develop significant need testosterone therapy study period . If occurs , patient switch testosterone group continue monitor study . All participant evaluate begin study 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Travel cost include . Evaluations include combination psychological motor skill test , questionnaire complete parent/caregiver study participant , physical examination , blood draw safety monitoring genetic study . Participation trial last one year include 5 clinic visit eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic Children 's Hospital Colorado Denver .</detailed_description>
