	<brief_summary>Background : - Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) disease cause fluid collect retina . It affect macula , center retina need sharp , clear vision . In many case , CSC resolve need treatment . However , case go away come back treatment . This know chronic CSC . - Chronic CSC may cause hormone call androgen . Finasteride drug alter effect certain androgen . Researchers want compare finasteride placebo see safe effective treatment chronic CSC . Objectives : - To see finasteride safe effective treatment chronic CSC . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age chronic CSC one eye . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . A full eye exam perform . Blood urine sample also collect . - Some participant may photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , standard treatment CSC . PDT help reduce amount fluid eye . Participants need wait 3 month PDT start finasteride study . - Participants separate two group . One group take finasteride 5 mg ( formulated capsule ) ; group take placebo capsule . All participant take capsule 3 month . - After 3 month assign capsule ( finasteride placebo ) , participants opportunity take finasteride least another 4 year 9 month . This phase study optional . - Participants regular study visit . At visit , physical exam eye exam . They also provide blood urine sample . - During first 3 month , participant 2 study visit . After 3 month , participant continue optional ( need ) phase protocol , visit occur Month 6 , Month 12 every 12 month thereafter . However , additional visit may need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) chorioretinal disorder characterize accumulation serous fluid retina . Although acute CSC tend resolve spontaneously minimal sequela , chronic CSC tend persist lead irreversible visual loss . The pathogenesis CSC complex . However , systemic androgen implicate . Finasteride anti-androgen medication widely use treatment various condition . A previous study perform NEI demonstrate reduction amount subretinal fluid among participant treat 5 mg finasteride . The objective study investigate efficacy oral finasteride treatment chronic CSC . Study Population : Thirty-eight participant chronic CSC eligible . Up additional four participant may enrol account participant withdraw study prior Month 3 . Design : In Phase II , single-center , placebo-controlled , double-masked , randomized trial , investigational product administer two different group . Half participant randomize 5 mg oral finasteride initial three month . The half participant randomize placebo first three month . At end three month treatment , participant may follow least four year nine month . During follow-up period , participant able receive finasteride therapy pro nata ( PRN ) subretinal fluid re-emerges . The PRN phase last last participant complete five year follow-up . Other standard care treatment , photodynamic therapy , also permit primary outcome three month . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome regulatory filing proportion participant improvement best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) ≥ 15 letter three month compare baseline study eye . The primary outcome publication study result proportion participant subretinal fluid volume decrease ≥ 50 % three month compare baseline study eye . Secondary efficacy outcome include change BCVA , change maximum retinal volume measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , change central retinal thickness OCT , change leakage see fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , change size exist plaque ( ) indocyanine green ( ICG ) angiography , change autofluorescence pattern see fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) imaging , change mean macular sensitivity assess microperimetry , change serum level testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , well change urine level cortisol study period . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse reaction investigational product number withdrawal .</detailed_description>
