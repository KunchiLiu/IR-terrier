	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Extreme low birth weight infant ( ELBW , &lt; 1000 gram birth weight ) typically dependent parenteral nutrition ( PN ) prolong period time . This put risk development liver complication PN , namely parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis ( PNAC ) . Intravenous lipid emulsion ( ILE ) base soy bean oil standard care preterm infant , might implicate pathogenesis PNAC . Fish oil rich omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LC-PUFA ) particularly accumulate liver brain fetus last trim pregnancy . In pediatric patient , ILEs base pure fish oil propose rescue therapy PNAC . Recently mixed lipid emulsion contain 15 % fish oil together soy bean , olive MCT oil become available PN Europe . Such balanced lipid emulsion might favourable standard soy bean oil emulsion ( Intralipid® ) concern development PNAC . Furthermore ILEs contain fish oil might exert positive effect neurodevelopment . However data far . AIM : To evaluate fish oil contain ILE ( SMOFlipid® ) prophylactic effect PNAC ELBW infant compare soy bean base ILE ( Intralipid® ) . STUDY DESIGN : Double blind prospective randomize trial . - Primary Outcome : PNAC define two conjugated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dl measurement two consecutive occasion . - Secondary Outcome : The important secondary outcome neurodevelopment 12 24 month correct age . - Exploratory Outcomes : Brain maturation measure amplitude integrate EEG ( aEEG ) flash visual evoked potential available clinical routine examination HYPOTHESIS : The use mixed lipid emulsion contain fish oil ( SMOFLIPID® ) reduce incidence PNAC compare standard soy bean oil base lipid emulsion .</detailed_description>
