	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn ipilimumab nivolumab help control uveal melanoma . Ipilimumab design increase immune system 's ability fight cancer . Nivolumab antibody ( protein attack foreign cell ) design allow body 's immune system work tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Nivolumab Combination With Ipilimumab Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute ( +/- 15 minute ) time . You receive nivolumab vein 60 minute ( +/- 15 minute ) time . You receive ipilimumab nivolumab every 3 week ( +/- 7 day ) total 4 dos ( Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 ) . You continue receive nivolumab every 2 week . Study Visits : At Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , every 6 week : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . If screening visit occur within 14 day first on-study visit , need repeat Day 1 Cycle 1 . - You ask symptom side effect may drug may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check liver thyroid function . - At Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Sometime Cycles 2-4 , core excisional biopsy tumor biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . To perform core biopsy , sample tissue remove use hollow core needle cut edge . To perform excisional biopsy , area abnormal skin , include portion normal skin area remove cut . You may receive stitch excisional biopsy . At Week 12 every 6 week , scan CT scan check status disease . Length Treatment : You may receive 4 dos ipilimumab may continue take nivolumab long doctor think best interest . You may longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit , follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish take study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask symptom side effect may side drug may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check liver thyroid function . Follow-Up : For least 60 day finish take study drug , follow-up phone clinic . You ask . This investigational study . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic melanoma , include uveal melanoma . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic melanoma , include uveal melanoma , gotten bad take ipilimumab . Combining 2 drug treat uveal melanoma investigational . Up 52 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
