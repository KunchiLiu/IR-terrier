Consumption low glycaemic index ( GI ) meal show improve glycaemic control , lipid profile reduce systemic inflammation . However , study international evidence-based nutritional recommendation principally base people European ethnicity consume fairly typical `` western '' diet . There publish control dietary intervention study attempt determine appropriate dietary pattern treatment diabetes amongst population consume rice-based diet . HYPOTHESIS 1 . The glycaemic response 6 day measure CGMS low mean glucose level postprandial increase individual consume LGI compare SDI meal plan . 2 . A LGI meal plan acceptable participant adhere comply diet level receive SDI meal plan . 3 . Glycaemic metabolic parameter measure integrated area curve ( IAUC ) glucose insulin low single meal comprise LGI compare SDI meal . 4 . The effect single meal LGI reduce appetite increase satiety compare meal SDI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study build information collect phase 1 involve documentation clinical metabolic characteristic dietary practice Chinese individual T2DM . In addition information separate study GI test locally consume carbohydrate contain food , formulate meal plan comprise low GI carbohydrate . Participants randomise low GI ( LGI ) intervention arm standard dietary intervention ( SDI ) arm receive counsel advice dietitian , embark two week protocol test recommend diet , review dietitian , undergo 3 6 day continuous glucose monitoring period LGI SDI diet . In addition , undergo 2 separate single day test meal comprise low GI high GI food . Participants group give resource include detailed instruction meal plan comparable two arm term contact research personnel , instruction meal plan isocaloric similar macronutrient composition appropriate energy requirement . Participants advise continue meal plan diet 22 week . At second month , telephone call make participant review compliance . At month 3 month 6 , participant ask attend overnight fast 10pm , blood sample , return food diary/ recall , measurement anthropometry blood pressure .
