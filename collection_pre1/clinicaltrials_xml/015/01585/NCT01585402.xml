	<brief_summary>Background : - Arterial Calcifications due Deficiency CD73 ( ACDC ) rare genetic disease . People ACDC develop calcium deposit arteries joint finger , wrist , ankle foot . These deposit cause severe pain hand foot , even person rest , may lead loss affected hand foot . Currently , standard treatment ACDC . - Etidronate drug help slow stop natural process dissolve bone tissue . It approve treat Paget disease , condition bone soft weak may deform , painful , easily break . It also use treat high blood calcium level . Researchers want see use treat symptom ACDC improve pain blood flow hand foot . Objectives : - To see etridronate safe effective treatment ACDC . Eligibility : - People 18 80 year age diagnose ACDC . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also image study , include x-rays DEXA bone scan , start treatment . Blood urine sample collect . An exercise tolerance test also give . - Participants take etridronate mouth day 14 day every 3 month . They assign individualized 6-month drug schedule follow . Participants eat food high calcium least 2 hour take study drug . - Participants regular study visit throughout treatment period . These visit involve image study , full dental exam , blood urine test . Participants also exercise tolerance test arm leg blood pressure test measure pain blood flow . - Participants may also provide tissue sample study . - Treatment continue 3 year long side effect severe condition become worse . Participants final follow-up visit stop treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We recently identify novel genetic disease affect nine know adult de novo vascular calcification develop low extremity artery juxta-articular joint capsule finger , wrist , ankle foot . This rare disease result bi-allelic mutation gene ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase ( NT5E ) , encode CD73 protein . CD73 , enzyme involved extracellular ATP metabolic pathway , convert extracellular AMP adenosine inorganic phosphate . The clinical symptom rare disease , term ACDC ( Arterial Calcifications due Deficiency CD73 ) , include claudication calf , thigh , buttock , chronic ischemic pain foot rest threat potential limb loss , debilitate rheumatoid pain wrist hand . Radiological histological evaluation resemble classic atherosclerotic vascular calcification , since calcification dysplasia ACDC occur medial portion arterial blood vessel wall . Data patient-specific cell line indicate increase activity tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase ( TNAP ) , key mediator pathological ectopic tissue calcification , thus reveal potential therapeutic target . To date , effective therapy exist ACDC patient . However , since bisphosphonates potent competitive inhibitor TNAP activity widely use modulate bone metabolism , may beneficially alter vascular calcification . In addition , preliminary vitro study demonstrate effectiveness etidronate , nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate , lower TNAP activity cell isolate ACDC patient . Etidronate , bisphophonates general , proven safe well tolerated patient . This protocol provide administration etidronate ACDC patient , alternative treatment available . Patients examine NIH Clinical Center bi-annually 3 year . The primary objective clinical study test effectiveness etidronate attenuate progression low extremity arterial calcification vascular blood flow base CT calcium score Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) .</detailed_description>
