	<brief_title>MARCH Vascular Endothelium Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease increasingly recognise complication HIV +/- therapy treat . Blood vessel elasticity , compliance , depict ability vessel convert intermittent blood flow ( cardiac ejection systole ) continuous blood flow throughout cardiac cycle . The compliance , ability vessel accept energy , subdivide elasticity large small vessel . Pulse wave tonometry non-invasive technique perform use hand-held tonometer generates two index correspond large artery elasticity ( LAE ) small artery elasticity ( SAE ) . LAE SAE estimate pulse waveform analysis previously show great correlation Framingham risk directly compare technique flow-mediated diltation , LAE SAE associate traditional cardiovascular risk factor ( smoking , insulin resistance , hypertension ) . It unclear net effect maraviroc , chemokine-receptor blocker cardiovascular function . The aim substudy : - To compare change vascular endothelium control arm ( ( N ( ) RTI ) plus PI/r ) maraviroc switch arm 48 week follow-up . - To compare change biomarkers select immunological marker control arm ( ( N ( ) RTI ) plus PI/r ) maraviroc switch arm 48 week follow-up .</detailed_description>
