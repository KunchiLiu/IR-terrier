	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study follow : 1 . There significant muscle activity difference muscle patient pre post operation . 2 . There significant forward reach distance/average velocity difference patient pre post operation . 3 . There significant standard deviation center pressure ( COP ) along x axis , speed COP along axis task COP path 3-sec hold phase difference patient pre post operation . 4 . There significant muscle activity difference muscle side post operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trunk Forward Ability Patients With Lumbar Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 healthy adult 30 patient go undergo lumbar fusion surgery recruit study . The assessment held surgery , two month , three month six month surgery . Visual pain scale passive range motion lumbar , hip , knee , ankle joint subject record . Then maximum voluntary contraction lower extremity measure electromyography . Finally , subject ask forward reach dominant upper limb/bilateral upper limbs/arm cross front chest three time stand sit position five practice . The motion data collect 3-dimension video muscle activity electromyography .</detailed_description>
