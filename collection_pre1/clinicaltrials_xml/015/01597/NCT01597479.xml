	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Distal Peripheral Nerve Blocks Postoperative Pain .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We design prospective randomize controlled trial , nursing blind evaluation . We enrol 52 patient schedule elective ambulatory TRA . 2 patient excluded randomization . Patients randomize two group : A . Group A= distal peripheral nerve block ( dPNBs group ; n = 24 ) : We perform usual anesthetic technique surgery : AXILLARY BRAQUIAL PLEXUS BLOCK use SHORT ACTING local anesthetic ( mepivacaine 1 % ) . Patients allocate group n't receive additional intervention postoperative period . B . Group B ( dPNBs group ; n = 26 ) : We perform anesthetic technique surgery ( AXILLARY BLOCK 1 % mepivacaine ) additional intervention . Patients allocate group receive postoperatively dPNBs target nerve . Based surgical approach technique evaluate radial median nerve responsible innervation surgical area , therefore responsible postoperative pain . We perform dPNBs ON RADIAL AND MEDIAN NERVES ( TARGET NERVES ) WITH LONG ACTING AND LOW CONCENTRATION LOCAL ANESTHETIC ( 0,125 % levobupivacaine 5ml/nerve ) . All block perform ultrasound guidance . Analgesic regime prescribe discharge group : dexketoprofen tramadol rescue analgesia . The primary outcome evaluate proportion patient experience moderate severe pain first second day postoperatively , mesured use numerical visual scale ( NVS ) 0 10 ( 0= pain 10= bad pain imaginable ) . We define mild pain ( NVS 0-3 ) , moderate pain ( NVS 7-10 ) severe pain ( NVS 7-10 ) . We consider dPNBs effective patient experience mild pain ( NVS 0-3 ) least 6 hour dPNBs puncture . Secondary outcome include : 1 . Maximum pain intensity first second day postoperatively . 2 . Duration dPNBs , define interval dPNBs performance occurrence first pain . 3 . Time discharge , define interval since patient arrive postoperative care unit ( PACU ) discharge home . 4 . Presence distal hand motor block dPNBs puncture . 5 . Needed rescue analgesia total consumption tramadol first second day postoperatively 6 . Incidence postoperative nausea vomit 1st 2nd day postoperatively 7 . Needed rescue antiemetic therapy , total consumption ondansetron effectiveness treatment 1st 2nd day postoperatively . Patients contact phone first second day postoperatively blind PACU nursing staff ( outcome data collect PACU nursing staff blind group allocation ) .</detailed_description>
