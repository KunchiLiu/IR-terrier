	<brief_summary>The propose study 1-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , trial evaluate efficacy IV infusion magnesium sulfate symptom treatment resistant mild moderate depression 20 male female ( 21-70 year age ) . Participants assess screening/baseline , day 1 , day 2 , day 7 , day 8 . Each subject randomize double-blind fashion receive either IV infusion magnesium sulfate 5 % dextrose follow washout period 5 day crossover receive either IV infusion 5 % dextrose magnesium sulfate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnesium Sulfate Versus 5 % Dextrose With Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : 1 . To determine magnesium deficient status treatment-resistant mild moderate depression patient via 24-hour urine magnesium assessment IV magnesium infusion . 2 . Correlation intracellular magnesium ( EXATEST ) , urine magnesium , serum magnesium well sensitivity IV magnesium infusion . 3 . To assess effectiveness magnesium sulfate infusion treatment resistant mild moderate depression patient . Objectives : Primary : 1 . To investigate magnesium deficient status treatment-resistant mild moderate depression patient via assay 24-hour urine magnesium , blood magnesium , EXATEST intracellular magnesium epithelial cell IV infusion . 2 . To assess effectiveness magnesium sulfate infusion mean change score Hamilton Rating Scale Depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) depression . Secondary : 1 . To correlate level magnesium score Hamilton Rating Scale Depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) depression .</detailed_description>
