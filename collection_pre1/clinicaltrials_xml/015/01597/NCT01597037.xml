	<brief_title>Aphasia Rehabilitation : Modulating Cues , Feedback &amp; Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death common cause disability United States . According American Stroke Association , prevalence stroke U.S. approximately 4.8 million approximately 700,000 additional stroke occur annually . Approximately 150,000 250,000 stroke survivor become severely permanently disabled year . A common neurological deficit among stroke survivor , thus substantial contributor post-stroke disability , aphasia . The loss , difficulty language extremely debilitate . Recently , emphasis need intensive aphasia treatment order make long-term neuroplastic change associate recovery . However , specific information regard effective learning parameter limit . A number variables practice condition , derive motor learn theory , potentially impact rehabilitation process . Several variable begin addressed literature , conflict scant evidence date . Variables include type degree external cueing , low versus high feedback condition , task complexity , practice distribution schedule . The purpose study : - Modulate variable cue , feedback script complexity potentially affect treatment outcome , measure effect acquisition , maintenance generalization script learning . These investigation conduct separate study , first study cross-over study investigate cue second study 2x2 factorial design investigate feedback complexity . - Modify optimize AphasiaScripts—an exist treatment program experimental support efficacy—by incorporating finding . - Conduct clinical trial , incorporate optimized AphasiaScripts program , order measure effect mass v distribute practice , block vs random practice schedule , acquisition , maintenance generalization script learning . Measures include independent pre-and post assessment acquisition , maintenance generalization script learn well dependent item/cue level measure progress . Results computational model acquisition , maintenance generalization contribute new evidence support efficacy delivery AphasiaScripts , also application practice principle aphasia treatment general . The first part study - cross-over study evaluate error-free versus error-reducing script training do . Below description second part study evaluate feedback script complexity .</detailed_description>
