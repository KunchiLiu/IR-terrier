	<brief_summary>This study healthy adult subject evaluate bioequivalence Combined Formulated Tablet compare maraviroc Combivir administer concurrently versus maraviroc + Combivir . 42 subject enrol study 40 subject complete dose critical assessment . The total duration subject 's participation approximately 33 35 day , include screen period ( Day −21 Day −1 ) , 2 treatment period ( Days 1-3 ) , least 7-day washout Period 1 Period 2 , follow-up visit 7 14 day last dose study drug Period 2 . Each dose period begin even prior dose extend 48 hour ( Day 3 ) dosing . Subjects randomly assign receive 1 follow 2 treatment Period 1 crossover receive alternate treatment Period 2 : In Sequence 1 ( N=21 ) subject receive Treatment A follow 7 day washout Treatment B . In Sequence 2 ( N=21 ) subject receive Treatment B follow 7 day washout Treatment A . Treatment A consist 1 tablet maraviroc 300 mg , lamivudine 150 mg , zidovudine 300 mg combine formulation overnight fast . Treatment B consist 1 tablet maraviroc 300 mg + 1 tablet Combivir take concurrently overnight fast . On Day 1 treatment period , subject receive study drug morning overnight fast least 8 hour . Study drug administer 240 mL water . Dosing treatment period separate minimum washout period least 7 day dos . All subject undergo safety assessment . Subjects may discharge study procedure complete morning Day 3 , instruction return next study period follow-up visit , appropriate . The follow-up visit occur 7 14 day last dose study drug Period 2 . Pharmacokinetic blood sample collect treatment period evaluation maraviroc , lamivudine , zidovudine dose 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 hour dose ( total 16 PK time point per treatment period ) . Protocol waiver exemption allow , exception immediate safety concern . Therefore , adherence study protocol requirement , include specified Time Events Table , essential require study conduct .</brief_summary>
