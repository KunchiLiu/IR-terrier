	<brief_summary>This early phase ( phase IIa ) , randomize , multi-center study subject acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . The purpose study investigate safety GSK2586881 determine effect people Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . The study two part : Part A open-label investigation five subject . Part B double-blind , placebo control investigation involve approximately 60 subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) form severe acute lung injury ( ALI ) characterize hypoxemic respiratory failure ( lung unable absorb oxygen arterial blood ) non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( accumulation fluid lung ) . The syndrome may cause direct indirect injury lung . It associate mortality rate 40-50 % . There market pharmacologic therapy devastate syndrome . This study aim assess safety , tolerability pharmacodynamics GSK2586881 , recombinant human angiotensin convert enzyme type 2 ( rhACE2 ) . ACE2 involve Renin-Angiotensin System ( RAS ) , control blood pressure , electrolytes intravascular fluid volume . A key function rhACE2 believe cleavage Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) Ang ( 1-7 ) , oppose physiological role . Elevated level Ang II associate vasoconstriction , inflammation , fibrosis , vascular leak , sodium absorption . Ang ( 1-7 ) appear counterregulatory protein RAS ; associate vasodilation , anti-proliferation , antiinflammation , reduce vascular leak . It observe level Ang II increase human ALI/ ARDS . It expect reduction Ang II positive impact ALI ARDS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , 18 80 year age ( inclusive ) Diagnosis ALI acute onset PaO2/FiO2 ratio less equal 300 , bilateral infiltrates consistent pulmonary edema frontal chest radiograph . The infiltrates may patchy , diffuse , homogeneous , asymmetric , requirement positive pressure ventilation via endotracheal tube , clinical evidence leave atrial hypertension Cause ALI think associate infection , sepsis , pneumonia , aspiration , similar judge PI and/or medical monitor The subject must randomize study within 48 hour time diagnosis ALI Period hemodynamic stability ( e.g . 46 hour ) prior initiation study treatment require resuscitative measure stable pressor requirement . In study lowdose arginine vasopressin consider pressor , permit Parts A B . If mechanically ventilate , duration mechanical ventilation must less 72 hour dose begin BMI within range 19.0 38.0 kg/m2 inclusive The subject legal decision maker capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . QTcB QTcF le 450 msec ; QTc le 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less 5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; bilirubin less equal 1.5 x ULN . Subjects whose clinical condition deteriorate rapidly subject investigator consider reasonable expectation able complete study . Known positive Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C antibody HIV antibody Current chronic history liver disease ( Child Pugh score great equal 10 ) , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Known history substance abuse alcohol abuse , within 6 month study cause chronic liver disease cirrhosis , chronic ascites portal hypertension , know evidence withdrawal syndrome within past 6 month . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Inability discontinue use Angiotensin convert enzyme type 1 inhibitor Angiotensin receptor blocker . Patients require high dos loop diuretic significant intravascular volume depletion , assess clinically History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation Pregnant female determine positive serum urine hCG test prior dose Lactating female Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol Subject legally incapacitate ( e.g . prisoner ) History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia Unstable Hemoglobin ( Hb less 7 ) time drug infusion Malignancy irreversible condition 6 month mortality estimate great 50 % Arterial blood pH le 7.1 serum HCO3 le 15 ( ABG available ) infusion start Known severe chronic respiratory disease : know Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) / Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) less 45 % predict , know chronic hypercapnia ( PaCO2 great 45 mmHg ) chronic hypoxemia ( PaO2 le 55 mmHg ) FiO2 =0.21 , know FEV1 le 15 ml/kg ( e.g . 1L 70 kg person ) , know radiographic evidence chronic interstitial infiltration , know hospitalization within past six month respiratory failure ( PaCO2 great 50 mmHg PaO2 le 55 mmHg , oxygen saturation le 88 % FiO2 = 0.21 ) , know chronic restrictive , obstructive , neuromuscular , chest wall , pulmonary vascular disease result severe exercise restriction Known history neuromuscular disease would affect time mechanical ventilation impairs ability ventilate spontaneously Vasculitis diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Lung transplantation Preexisting renal failure hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis require renal replacement therapy A patient exclude judgement Principle Investigator GSK medical monitor participation could jeopardize health subject integrity study .</criteria>
