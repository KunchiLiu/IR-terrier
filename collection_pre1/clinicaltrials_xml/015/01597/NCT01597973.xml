	<brief_summary>Approximately 444 subject great equal 18 95 year age , non-pregnant , inpatient set one study sit evaluate treatment efficacy . Analysis include subject bloodstream infection ( BSI ) pneumonia due least one follow gram-negative bacilli organism : Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella spp , Escherichia coli , Enterbactor spp . and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrate vitro non-susceptibility define extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacillus ( XDR-GNB ) include XDR-AB , XDR-PA CRE . If subject BSI pneumonia time study enrollment , include subject pneumonia . Objectives : Primary : •Determine whether treatment regimen Colistimethate sodium ( colistin ) combine carbapenem ( imipenem meropenem ) associate decrease risk mortality compare colistin alone subject bloodstream infection ( BSI ) and/or pneumonia due XDR-GNB . Secondary : •Determine treatment regimen ( colistin monotherapy colistin combine carbapenem ( imipenem meropenem ) likely reduce emergence colistin resistance among XDR-GNB isolates therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Gram-negative bacillus organism Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella spp. , Escherichia coli , Enterbactor spp . Pseudomonas aeruginosa become frequent cause bloodstream infection pneumonia hospital healthcare setting . Among pathogen , antimicrobial resistance emerge many class antimicrobial agent . Most concerning , emergence resistance group 2 carbapenems ( imipenem ) . In several region world , include Southeastern Michigan , strain extensively-drug resistant Gram-negative bacillus ( XDR-GNB ) exhibit resistance , case type available antimicrobial agent , include group 2 carbapenems , emerge disseminate . Treatment option XDR-GNB typically include Colistimethate sodium ( refer colistin study ) , use alone ( monotherapy ) combination agent . Unfortunately , resistance colistin begin emerge strain XDR-GNB , truly concern development , since colistin one last remain treatment option XDR-GNB . No prospective , randomize control trial conduct evaluate clinical efficacy colistin monotherapy versus colistin-containing combination therapy impact therapeutic modality emergence colistin resistance among XDR-GNB . We plan conduct double-blind randomize controlled trial include patient pneumonia bloodstream infection due XDR-GNB . After enrollment , subject randomize receive 14 day either colistin monotherapy colistin plus meropenem . In Detroit metro area , infection due XDR-GNB develop regional challenge common problem . We assemble multi-disciplinary team include Infectious Diseases researcher , clinician , infectious disease pharmacist , microbiologist , epidemiologists statistical expert address critically important question challenge regard management bloodstream infection pneumonia due XDR-GNB . Specifically , hypothesize combination colistin imipenem provide superior efficacy treatment XDR-GNB pneumonia bloodstream infection prevent emergence decrease susceptibility colistin among XDR-GNB strain . We also aim analyze tool could use `` real time '' aid clinician treat patient infection due XDR-GNB . For example , aim analyze association presence vitro synergy colistin carbapenem ( imipenem meropenem ) combination ( determined E-test ) clinical outcome ; association colistin plasma level clinical outcome development nephrotoxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized Adults ( &gt; 18 year 95 year age ) , one study sit . Diagnosis BSI and/or pneumonia due preliminary result gramnegative nonlactose fermenter oxidase negative ; final result XDRA . baumannii ; carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaciae ; XDR P. aeruginosa and/or patient suspect BSI and/or HAP prior history ( within last 6 month ) XDRGNB susceptible colistin . If final result indicate pathogen XDRGNB , identifies alternative treatment option , patient would eligible study subject allergic alternative treatment option . Patients polymicrobial respiratory blood infection , include XDRGNB one pathogen , include study , long XDRGNB determine true pathogen ( AB , CRE PA ) . Other pathogen treat antimicrobial agent determine treat physician . If one XDRGNB study pathogen identify study pathogen cause BSI and/or pneumonia , first study pathogen recover consider primary study pathogen . If one study pathogen recover culture , infection categorize cause multiple study pathogen . Patients life expectancy &gt; 24 hour Signed write informed consent HIPAA Authorization form ( US sit ) Female patient pregnant Female patient nurse Patients prisoner Patients le 18 year age great equal 96 year age Patients neutropenia ( WBC &lt; 500 cells/mm3 ) The presence follow know clinical syndrome involve XDRGNB pathogen necessitate duration antimicrobial therapy great 14 day : endocarditis , osteomyelitis , prosthetic joint infection , meningitis and/or central nervous system infection . Patients receive valproic acid ( without know seizure disorder ) . Patients receive 72 hour polymyxin treatment ( intravenous inhale [ pneumonia ] ) within 96 hour enrollment . Patients endstage renal disease require hemodialysis , exclude evaluation pertain nephrotoxicity per protocol population . Patients know Type 1 severe drug allergy either study drug βlactams .</criteria>
