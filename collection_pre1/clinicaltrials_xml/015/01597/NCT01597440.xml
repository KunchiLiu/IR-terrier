	<brief_summary>Background : Very drug exist treat hyperammonemia , specifically PA MMA . Diet restriction alternate pathway agent current primary treatment , frequently fail prohibit brain damage . Orthotopic liver transplantation cure hyperammonemia urea cycle disorder , organ availability limited procedure highly invasive require life-long immunosuppression . A drug could repair stimulate dysfunctional urea cycle would several advantage current therapy . A drug call N-carbamyl-L-glutamate , Carglumic acid ( NCG Carbaglu ) recently find virtually curative another urea cycle defect call NAGS deficiency . In disorder , treatment NCG alone normalize ureagenesis , blood ammonia glutamine level , allow normal protein tolerance restore health . Knowledge study apply acquire hyperammonemia , specifically patient propionic PA MMA , try improve neurodevelopmental outcome improve hyperammonemia . Aims : The overall objective project determine whether treatment acute hyperammonemia Carglumic acid propionic acidemia ( PA ) , methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA ) change long-term outcome disease determine effective restore urine ammonia level normal level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Outcome N-Carbamylglutamate Treatment Propionic Acidemia Methylmalonic Acidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods/Design This 5-year , Phase II , double-blind study aim recruit enroll 34 PA MMA patient acute episode hyperammonemia . The primary aim circumvent long-term neurodevelopmental decline due prolonged level ammonia crisis blood urine . After treatment crisis resolution Carbaglu placebo standard care therapy , measure neurodevelopmental outcome ( Bayley II Functional Status Scale ) measure 9 , 15,21 30 month post-discharge hospital . Safety NCG treatment also monitor measure close examination adverse event laboratory blood test . To test effectiveness NCG , longitudinal model evaluate groupwise difference ( NCG v . Placebo ) trajectory change neurodevelopmental outcome safety analyse drug placebo patient . Subsequent Episodes At time initial episode , participant may present hospital PA- MMA-associated symptom . If plasma ammonia level verify bonafide episode HA ( plasma ammonia ≥ 100 µmol/l ) , participant receive study medication receive initial episode double-blinded fashion , ( i.e . If participant receive NCG time initial randomization , he/she continue receive NCG subsequent HA episode . If participant receive PLBO time initial randomization , he/she continue receive PLBO subsequent HA episode ) . Only pharmacist know participant receives NCG PLBO . The study assessment ( previously state ) conduct qualify HSA episode .</detailed_description>
