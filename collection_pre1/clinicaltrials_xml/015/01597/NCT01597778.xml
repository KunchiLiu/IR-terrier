	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) one treatment option people leukemia lymphoma . Family member , unrelated donor bank umbilical cordblood unit similar tissue type use HCT . This study compare effectiveness two new type bone marrow transplant people leukemia lymphoma : one use bone marrow donate family member partially match bone marrow ; , one use two partially match cord blood unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Cord Versus Haploidentical ( BMT CTN 1101 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced intensity conditioning ( RIC ) blood marrow transplantation ( BMT ) allow old less clinically fit patient receive potentially curative treatment allogeneic HCT high risk advance hematological malignancy . Patients lack HLA-matched sibling may receive graft suitably HLA-matched unrelated donor . However , third patient HLA-matched sibling suitably match adult unrelated donor ( i.e. , mismatch single locus ) . Even suitably match unrelated donor identify , data National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) indicate median four month require complete search result transplantation ; thus , number patient succumb disease await identification evaluation suitably match adult unrelated donor . Single dual center study show partially HLA-mismatched related bone marrow ( haplo-BM ) unrelated double umbilical cord blood ( dUCB ) valuable source donor cell RIC HCT , thus extend treatment modality patient lack donor . In order study reproducibility , thus , wide applicability two alternative donor strategy , The Blood Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials Network ( BMT CTN ) conduct two parallel multicenter prospective Phase II clinical trial . These two study evaluate safety efficacy relate haplo-BM ( BMT CTN 0603 ) dUCB ( BMT CTN 0604 ) transplantation RIC . Both alternative donor approach produce early result similar report unrelated donor , even HLA-matched sibling , HCT . These data demonstrate efficacy approach , also safely export single center setting . Both haplo-BM dUCB graft obtain rapidly great 90 % patient lack HLA-matched donor . This study test hypothesis progression free survival two year RIC haplo-BM transplantation similar progression free survival RIC dUCB transplantation .</detailed_description>
