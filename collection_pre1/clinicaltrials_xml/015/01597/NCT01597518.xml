	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate efficacy safety riluzole treatment patient acute SCI . The primary objective evaluate superiority riluzole , dose 2 x 100 mg first 24 hour follow 2 x 50 mg follow 13 day injury , compare placebo , change 180 day baseline motor outcome measure International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury Examination ( ISNCSCI ) Motor Score , patient acute traumatic SCI , present hospital le 12 hour injury . Secondary objective evaluate effect riluzole overall neurologic recovery , sensory recovery , functional outcome , quality life outcome , health utility , mortality , adverse event . The work hypothesis riluzole treat subject experience superior motor , sensory , functional , quality life outcome compare receive placebo , acceptable safety profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present 1 million people live Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) North America alone , annual cost acute treatment chronic care patient total four billion dollar USD . The worldwide prevalence SCI unknown , estimate range 250 million individual . The incidence SCI develop country estimate 10 - 40 case per million inhabitant . In spite immense impact SCI personal societal level , effective safe pharmacologic treatment SCI , show improve neurological functional outcome long-term follow-up , remain absent . The final degree neurological tissue destruction occur traumatic SCI product primary secondary injury mechanism . The primary mechanical injury cord initiate subsequent signal cascade deleterious down-stream event , know collectively secondary injury mechanism . These secondary injury mechanism include ischemia , interstitial cellular ionic imbalance , free radical formation , glutamatergic excitotoxicity , lipid peroxidation generation arachidonic acid metabolite . Although little do therapeutic standpoint correct damage sustain primary injury , mitigate evolution secondary injury event opportunity preserve remnant viable neurological tissue improve neurologic outcome . There convince evidence preclinical realm pharmacologic agent riluzole attenuate certain aspect secondary injury cascade lead diminished neurological tissue destruction animal SCI model . Riluzole , sodium channel block benzothiazole anticonvulsant , specifically exert neuroprotective effect help maintain neuronal cellular ionic balance reduce release excitotoxic glutamate post-SCI setting . Several preclinical study rodent SCI model associate administration riluzole increase neural tissue preservation site injury , addition improve behavioral outcome , comparison administration placebo sodium channel block drug . In clinical realm , riluzole study extensively context SCI , widely use treatment amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . A 2007 Cochrane review , summarize finding 4 placebo-controlled randomized trial , conclude dose 100 mg daily , riluzole safe improve median survival 2-3 month patient ALS . In regard adverse event ( AEs ) , riluzole well tolerate , although treated patient 2.6 time likely experience three-fold increase serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) compare patient treat placebo . However , effect find uniformly reversible cessation riluzole therapy report several month medication administration . Recently , clinical safety pharmacokinetic profile riluzole study multi-center pilot study context traumatic SCI . A total 36 patient receive oral dose riluzole 50 mg twice daily 2 week , treatment initiate within 12 hour injury patient . The 12 hour dose window , well 2 week duration therapy , choose match period medication administration know period glutamatergic excitotoxicity SCI ( several minute injury 2 week injury ) . With final analysis currently undergo peer review , completion study confirm acceptable safety profile riluzole administration previously document ALS literature , establish feasibility conduct large-scale efficacy trial investigate therapy . At present , specific pharmacological therapy give uniformly patient traumatic SCI . As result , placebo-controlled comparison group ethical justifiable . The aim current trial evaluate efficacy safety riluzole treatment patient acute SCI . The primary objective current Phase II/III trial evaluate superiority riluzole , dose 2 x 100 mg first 24 hour follow 2 x 50 mg follow 13 day injury , compare placebo , change 180 day baseline motor outcome measure International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury Examination ( ISNCSCI ) Motor Score , patient acute traumatic SCI , present hospital le 12 hour injury .</detailed_description>
