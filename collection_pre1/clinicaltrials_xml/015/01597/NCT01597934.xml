	<brief_summary>Switching Entecavir ( ETV ) plus Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF ) combination result faster great antiviral activity lower rate resistance emergence maintain Lamivudine ( LAM ) /Telbivudine ( LdT ) +Adefovir ( ADV ) combination partial responder LAM/LdT+ADV rescue therapy . Earlier switch combination potent regimen effective achieve virologic response ( VR ) prevent resistance emergence . All subject orally take assigned drug daily 48 week . All subject assess baseline every three month thereafter . Evaluations visit include vital sign , physical examination , laboratory test , HBV DNA level adverse event . At baseline every six month thereafter , serum assay HBV serology . Genotypic analysis perform baseline 48 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiviral Efficacy Switching ETV Plus TDF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . As TDF approve yet Korea , current KASL practice guideline generally recommend add ADV LAM-resistant LdT-resistant patient . 2 . However , several local literature report substantial proportion patient treat LAM plus ADV combination therapy show persistently inadequate partial virologic response ( 'VR ' ) YMDDm still maintain spite rescue combination therapy . 3 . Due unavailability TDF Korea , ETV plus ADV combination consider good salvage therapy non-overlapping cross-resistance profile pt fail LAM plus ADV rescue therapy local report demonstrate rate VR significantly high ETV+ADV switch group LAM+ADV continuation group partial responder LAM plus ADV combination rescue therapy LAM resistance . 4 . Hence , early combination therapy potent Nucleoside Nucleotide analogue would promise salvage treatment previous NA treatment failure comparative prospective trial limit . 5 . Therefore , study investigate great effectiveness safety switch potent combination versus maintain LAM ( LdT ) plus ADV also compare rate VR base HBV DNA cut-off level switch - le 20,000 IU/mL . All subject orally take assigned drug daily 48 week . All subject assess baseline every three month thereafter . Evaluations visit include vital sign , physical examination , laboratory test , HBV DNA level adverse event . At baseline every six month thereafter , serum assay HBV serology . Genotypic analysis perform baseline 48 week .</detailed_description>
