	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize many parturients , fact , spontaneously micturate low dose combine spinal epidural analgesic dos give labor Foley catheterization unnecessary majority parturients . At Prentice Women 's Hospital , almost 9000 woman annually receive neuraxial labor analgesia 98 % receive Foley catheter . By potentially reduce necessity Foley catheter , investigator able ultimately reduce rate bacteriuria , urinary tract infection urethritis lead unnecessary treatment antibiotic , well reduce cost place unnecessary Foley catheter.The hypothesis parturients receive low dose combine spinal epidural analgesia analgesia induction labor randomize spontaneous micturition protocol require few Foley catheter placement demonstrate low incidence positive urine culture postpartum undergo standard Foley catheter placement .</brief_summary>
