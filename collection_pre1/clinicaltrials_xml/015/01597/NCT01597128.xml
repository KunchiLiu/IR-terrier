	<brief_title>Feasibility Study The Use FLEX HD® Surgical Implant STRATTICE® Reconstructive Tissue Matrix The Closure Abdominal Wall Defects With Component Separation Clean Contaminated Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At least 100,000 ventral hernia repair perform U.S. year . Recently , biologically-based implant derive acellular human dermis , porcine small intestinal submucosa , porcine dermis report variety complex abdominal wall repair procedure . A variety surgical technique implant placement method describe , one standard technique achieve precedence . Biologic implant reinforcement myofascial closure mean component separation , minimum , three-layer fascial approximation possible , sublay placement ( i.e. , closure posterior rectus sheath implant ) describe strategy . These technique allow placement implant intact fascial layer may improve implant incorporation host tissue . The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation ( MTF ) manufacture process Flex HD Acellular Hydrated Dermis . This acellular dermis derive human skin . In complicated ventral hernia repair , type graft tissue necessary . Flex HD show reduce operative time , low operative cost provide minimal elasticity . The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation ( MTF ) non-profit service organization dedicate provide quality allograft tissue commitment excellence education , research , recovery care recipient , donor family . MTF national consortium comprise academic medical institution , organ procurement organization tissue recovery organization . From inception , donor-focused surgeon-driven . Since inception 1987 , MTF recover 60,000 donor distribute 3 million graft transplantation . The Foundation establish surgeon teach institution meet need high quality consistent allograft supply .</detailed_description>
