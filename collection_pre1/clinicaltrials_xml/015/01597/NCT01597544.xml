	<brief_summary>This study divide two part . The first part prospective observational study patient undergo pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) surgery . The goal determine patient preference 3 different method bladder drainage case post-operative voiding dysfunction ( POVD ) : transurethral indwell catheterization ( TIC ) , clean intermittent self-catheterization ( CISC ) , suprapubic tube ( SPT ) . The second part study choose CISC prefer method , whereby patient randomize receive CISC instruction either pre- post-operatively determine whether difference overall patient satisfaction base timing teaching . The investigator hypothesize patient receive informed consent pre-operatively favour use SPT TIC CISC manage potential POVD . Among patient opt CISC management post-operative voiding dysfunction , patient teach perform CISC pre-operatively clinic high level satisfaction compare taught post-operatively hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-operative Voiding Dysfunction : Preferred Method Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method PART 1 For first part study , patient preference TIC , CISC , SPT assess face-to-face interview patient sufficient time read information sheet three option available opportunity ask question . This ensure every patient receive information . The face-to-face interview perform patient 's physician one two urogynecology nurse work St. Michael 's Hospital Women 's Health Care Centre . The patient 's choice record pre-operative record study database one study personnel . Other data collect include patient demographic ( age , education level , level home support , current past occupation ) , clinical characteristic ( BMI , parity , International Continence Society ( ICS ) stage prolapse , pre-operative urinary diagnosis ) ( Appendix 4 ) . Peri-operatively , data collect include surgery perform , length hospital stay , occurrence peri-operative complication . At institution define normal void function void volume &gt; 200 mL post-voided residual ( PVR ) &lt; 100 mL void volume &gt; 400 mL PVR &lt; 33 % ( 1/3 ) total voided volume . Patients meet criterion two separate void hospital classify post-operative voiding dysfunction . Once meet criterion void dysfunction , method bladder drainage use ( TIC , CISC SPT ) length time use record . To reduce rate bacteriuria sign bladder infection [ 25 ] , antibiotic prophylaxis administer usual patient require bladder drainage 24 hour . The antibiotic regimen consist : Macrodantin 100 mg PO daily time bladder drainage , Trimethoprim 100 mg PO daily allergic . This regimen currently use department . For patient underwent catheterization post-operative period , satisfaction regard catheter management assess use visual analog scale base previously publish questionnaire . This questionnaire administer day discharge , post-operative day seven , six week surgery . Post-operative bladder function require catheterization assess post-operative day seven six week surgery use uroflowmetry testing , PVR measurement , specimen urine culture . PART 2 Women consent second part study randomize either pre-operative CISC teach clinic post-operative CISC teaching hospital . A computer-generated list random number use allocate participant 2 group equal size . To ensure consistency teach patient CISC , nurse clinic hospital use protocol instruction CISC . Patients allocate pre-operative CISC teach group teach perform CISC one urogynecology nurse work Women 's Health Care Centre . Patients allow practice feel comfortable technique . This take approximately 30 minute . The session take place day pre-operative medical appointment ( PAF ) , normally occur less month surgery . If patient see PAF see month surgery , separate appointment CISC teach month precede surgery organize . Post-operatively , nurse hospital gynecology unit review technique make sure patient still comfortable perform CISC . Patients allocate post-operative CISC teach group instruct CISC surgery , start post-operative day one . One nurse hospital gynecology unit teach supervise patient feel comfortable technique catheterization longer require ( e.g . patient pass void trial two separate occasion ) . This protocol currently use institution . Patients group comfortable independent perform CISC prior discharge hospital . Following discharge , nurse Women 's Health Care Centre available answer question telephone . For group , satisfaction assess questionnaire administer day discharge , post-operative day seven , six week surgery . Assessment post-operative bladder function require catheterization occur post-operative day seven six week surgery use uroflowmetry testing , PVR measurement , specimen urine culture . Patients post-operative void dysfunction withdrawn study . Since impossible predict experience post-operative voiding dysfunction , essential recruit potential participant prior surgery receive pre-operative CISC teaching allocate group . Pre-operative data , however , keep recruited patient purose study analysis . Data analysis PART 1 Demographic measure , catheterization choice , clinical data summarize use descriptive statistic . Patient satisfaction assess use questionnaire review score . The questionnaire 6 item item consist 10 cm line visual analogue scale . Patients ask put `` X '' line 2 extreme . The distance begin line patient 's X measure score obtain . Scores calculate add score 6 item ( range 0 60 ) , divide 6 multiply 10 . Missing item deal use sum answer item , divide number item answer . Patient answer few 4 question consider analysis . PART 2 As , demographic measure clinical data summarize use descriptive statistic . Each questionnaire review score . For part study , questionnaire modify addition three item response scale score 0 10 . Scores calculate add score 9 item ( range 0 90 ) , divide 9 multiply 10 . Missing item deal use Sum answer item , divide number item answer . Patient answer few 6 question consider analysis . Each questionnaire review score . Satisfaction score two group ( pre-operative post-operative teaching ) compare use two-sided Student 's t-test . For part study , continuous variable summarize mean ( standard deviation ) median ( minimum , maximum ) compare group use Student 's t-tests Kruskal Wallis test . Categorical variable summarize count ( percent ) compare group use Fisher 's exact test . Sample Size Calculation For first part study , aim survey minimum 150 patient . The power calculation second part study base previous study [ 11 ] . Based finding , define minimal relevant difference patient satisfaction regard CISC teach 30 % standard deviation +/- 30 . With power 0.8 alpha 0.05 , minimum number patient require group eight . We anticipate 10 % drop rate consent expect 65 % patient require form outpatient catheterization surgery . Therefore , require 25 patient per arm second part study . Recruitment first part study cease recruit patient require second part recruit 150 patient , whichever come first . Timeline completion Based operative hospital data 2010 , need approximately 24 month recruit patient collect data . Three month require data analysis manuscript preparation .</detailed_description>
