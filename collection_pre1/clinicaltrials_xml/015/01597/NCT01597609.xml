	<brief_summary>Approximately 60 obese , otherwise healthy , subject assess benchmark study investigate physiological change associate weight loss regain . The aim estimate change body composition three intervention ( ) calorie restrict diet + market anti-obesity drug ( sibutramine ) ( ii ) calorie restrict diet + sibutramine placebo , ( iii ) calorie restrict diet + moderate exercise . The intervention last 12 week , 12 week observation period subject return normal lifestyle expect regain weight . Additionally , range biomarkers may evaluate determine whether correlation early late time point weight fat loss weight fat regain . The change body composition biomarkers use determine whether mathematical model build predict weight loss regain individual subject . In addition , usefulness tool may aid physiological characterisation weight loss/regain assess , particular method measure energy expenditure energy intake ambulatory activity meter , Sussex Ingestion Pattern Monitor ™ ( SIPM ) , hunger-satiety VAS , indirect calorimetry , available , Theranos in-home graphical user interface ( GUI ) portal . Knowledge body composition change result typical weight loss intervention predictive marker response would facilitate design future study novel anti-obesity agent allow early , inform triaging NCEs .</brief_summary>
