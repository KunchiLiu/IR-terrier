	<brief_summary>Heart failure common condition debilitate symptom poor prognosis . Patients heart failure massively overactive sympathetic nervous system attempt compensate poorly functioning heart . This ultimately detrimental effect . One principle mediator sympathetic response find nerve cell kidney . Whilst significant proportion medication use treat heart failure act harmful pathway , none target kidney sympathetic-nerve cell specifically . Additionally , multiple site action drug side effect . A new procedure recently develop treatment high blood pressure renal denervation . This involve insert small catheter femoral artery pass kidney artery x-ray guidance . From , use radiofrequency wave , sympathetic nerve within kidney destroy . The investigator anticipate procedure significant positive effect patient heart failure aim perform pilot safety study 7 individual advanced heart failure ass safety effectiveness . The investigator hypothesise renal artery denervation lead significant clinical biochemical improvement patient mark heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One key physiological change see heart failure patient overactivity sympathetic nervous system . This homeostatic response produce body attempt compensate poorly functioning heart resultant underperfused tissue . In acute heart failure positive effect chronic heart failure , long stand sympathetic overactivity cause multiple undesirable side effect include profound vasoconstriction , increase sodium reabsorption kidney , renin release decrease renal blood flow . Afferent efferent sympathetic chain renal artery play important role mediation response . Current management heart failure principally hinge drug attempt attenuate interrupt response via renin angiotensin system , adrenoreceptors renal tubule . These drug multiple side effect , partly multiple site action . None directly target sympathetic discharge source . The development renal artery denervation open unique opportunity potentially longlasting relief intense renal sympathetic over-activity . The technique current role management resistant hypertension show favourable result minimal side effect . The investigator envisage technique could also highly beneficial patient heart failure directly interrupt sympathetic overactivity . This initial study involve 7 patient pilot safety study assess potential .</detailed_description>
