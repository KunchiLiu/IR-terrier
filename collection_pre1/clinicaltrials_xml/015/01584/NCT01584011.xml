	<brief_summary>Objectives To evaluate impact taste disturbance different type chronic middle ear disease middle ear surgery . Hypothesis That patient chronic otitis medium cholesteatoma taste disturbance already surgery due disease , course depend degree disease . That patient otosclerosis , normal nerve function surgery . That patient normal taste surgery likely notice taste disturbance . That nerve continuity surgery , even maltreat , give less taste disturbance divide nerve . Methods A clinical study launch measure taste function two different method taste measurement , electrogustometry ( EGM ) filter paper disc method ( FPD ) middle ear surgery patient operate middle ear surgery otosclerosis , chronic otitis medium cholesteatoma . The investigator plan include 120 patient study . A parallel study patient experience symptom also launch patient answer questionary quality life document . The investigator plan include 300 patient study . A histological study specimen CTN healthy ear ears chronic disease investigate electron microscopy also start .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Taste sensation provide three different nerve chorda tympani nerve ( CTN ) major taste nerve . It innervate taste bud two anterior third tongue . The CTN location middle ear predisposes trauma nerve . In various form middle ear pathology , chronic otitis cholesteatoma nerve affect pathologic process per se , since nerve may become exposed bacteria toxin , enzymes mechanical damage . During middle ear surgery , cut , stretch , touch dry heat microscope light beam . The nerve function situation clarify . Is example well cut nerve leave traumatize surgery . Therefore previous report objective CTN function pre- postoperatively unfortunate suffer inadequate description ear disease study . In order elucidate question give surgeon deep knowledge handle CTN surgery prospective study initiate patient operated primary middle ear surgery . We believe patient chronic otitis medium cholesteatoma taste disturbance already surgery due disease , course depend degree disease , patient otosclerosis normal nerve function surgery . We also believe patient normal taste surgery likely notice taste disturbance nerve continuity surgery , even maltreat , give less taste disturbance divide nerve . Two method taste measure use study , Electrogustometry ( EGM ) Filter Paper Disc method ( FPD ) . We evaluate EGM regard possible bias artifact well correlation regard result two method . The study contain three substudies arm . 1 . A clinical prospective trial 100 patient undergoes primary middle ear surgery chronic otitis , cholesteatoma otosclerosis evaluate EGM FPD surgery . They also answer questionnaire subjective taste disturbance questionnaire quality life . 2 . A clinical multi center study 200 patient undergoes primary surgery otosclerosis . These patient answer questionnaire subjective taste disturbance questionnaire quality life . 3 . A histological study electron microscopy CTN healthy ear ears whit chronic otitis cholesteatoma . We plan investigate sample five healthy five sick ear EM .</detailed_description>
