	<brief_summary>Background : - Lymphoma rate Asia low West , rate rise recent year . Most study lymphoma patient conduct West . Less information available factor might contribute rise lymphoma Asia . Researchers want collect medical personal history sample people recently diagnose lymphoma . This information help study possible reason increase . Objectives : - To collect sample history part introductory study lymphoma Asia . Eligibility : - People 18 79 year age enter study hospital Hong Kong , Taiwan , mainland China treatment type lymphoma . - Healthy volunteer 18 79 never lymphoma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - They provide blood sample cheek cell sample test . - Participants complete questionnaire personal health history . They answer question exposure chemical like pesticide . They also ask family medical history work residential history . Finally answer question lifestyle factor like diet exercise . - They give permission researcher see medical record . Researchers also access tumor sample collect part treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The contribution environmental , occupational genetic factor lymphoma generate series novel finding study Caucasians . However , none chemical association conclusively establish identification key , functional allele gene region associate risk NHL require elucidation . Further , ability follow-up , confirm , extend observation limit low prevalence limit range several important chemical exposure high complete linkage disequilibrium among key candidate genetic locus Western population . To optimize ability build clarify finding , necessary investigate population differ Caucasians exposure pattern underlying genetic structure . A multidisciplinary case-control study lymphoma Asia provide opportunity replicate extend recent novel observation make study among Caucasians population distinctly different regard pattern key risk factor , include range exposure , prevalence exposure , correlation exposure , variation gene region particular interest . Thus , hospital-based case-control study lymphoma Eastern Asia ( i.e. , AsiaLymph ) 4,200 case 4,200 control enrol three-year period conduct . In addition , 2,000 case myeloid leukemias additional 2,400 case less common lymphoma subtypes enrol well . The major postulate risk factor evaluation study chemical exposure ( i.e. , organochlorines , trichloroethylene , benzene ) genetic susceptibility . Other factor potentially related NHL , viral infection , UV exposure , medical condition , lifestyle factor also explore . A particularly noteworthy aspect AsiaLymph central pathology review immunophenotyping two world lead lymphoma pathologist , enable accurate analysis finding molecular histologic subtypes . AsiaLymph represent optimal next step DCEG lymphoma portfolio . AsiaLymph confirm extend previous finding , yield novel insight cause lymphoma leukemia Asia West .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Eligible case patient participate hospital 18 79 year age time initial diagnosis admit treated incident diagnosis lymphoid myeloid neoplasm include NHL Hodgkin disease . Although important understand etiology lymphoma child well , undertake would require additional hospital , instrument , expertise , fund currently available research team . Adults age 80 generally among sick patient hospital often multiple comorbidities , may preclude participation interview length . Cases permanent resident general geographic region serve hospital time diagnosis . Cases include chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma , Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia , plasmacytoma , multiple myeloma , aggressive NK cell leukemia , cutaneous lymphoma , myeloid neoplasm , immunosuppressionassociated case ( HIV , post transplant , Methotrexate use ) . 2,400 lymphoid neoplasm case enrol less common subtypes Asian population include Hodgkin disease , multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , NK/T , T , follicular marginal zone lymphoma , order increase statistical power study risk factor tumor . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Cases previous diagnosis lymphoma , acute lymphoblastic lymphoma , multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , nonHodgkin lymphoma , ineligible .</criteria>
