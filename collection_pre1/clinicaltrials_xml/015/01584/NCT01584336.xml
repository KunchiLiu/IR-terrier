	<brief_title>Laparoscopy-assisted Total Gastrectomy Clinical Stage I Gastric Cancer ( KLASS-03 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer remain one common neoplasms Asia western country , although incidence decrease worldwide . Recently , rate detection early gastric cancer increase surgical technique develop , laparoscopic procedure introduce tried treatment early-stage gastric cancer . Already prospective , randomized trial safety oncologic outcomes laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy gastric cancer try , large-scaled , prospective study laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy ( LATG ) seldom . One reason low popularity LATG require dissection lymph nod splenic hilum along short gastric artery reason reconstruction total gastrectomy also complicate . The third reason chance total gastrectomy less frequent distal gastrectomy low incidence upper gastric cancer . This KLASS-03 trial prospective , multicenter trial LATG early upper gastric cancer . The primary purpose study evaluate incidence postoperative morbidity mortality second purpose evaluate surgical outcome several method reconstruction laparoscopic total gastrectomy postoperative course LATG patient .</detailed_description>
