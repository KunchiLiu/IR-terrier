	<brief_title>Single Ascending Dose Safety Study Oxfendazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase I study propose randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled evaluation safety pharmacokinetics escalate single oral dos oxfendazole ( 0.3 30 mg/kg ) healthy volunteer . The dose increase approximately three-fold ( one-half log ) increment , cohort comprise ten volunteer ( eight drug , two placebo ) . Subjects monitor three week dose , include monitoring pharmacokinetics metabolism oxfendazole blood urine . Each new cohort dose three week safety data precede group analyze . If clinically significant adverse event observe , event possibly drug-related , additional ( final ) cohort volunteer repeat high tolerate dose oxfendazole . Up 70 volunteer ( 56 drug , 14 placebo ) complete study .</detailed_description>
