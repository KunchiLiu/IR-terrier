	<brief_summary>Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) preterm infant one many devastate consequence prematurity acute long-term sequela . Turning preterm infant 's head one side may increase intracranial pressure occlude major ipsilateral vein neck , could increase cerebral venous pressure decrease cerebral venous drainage . Keeping preterm infant ' head slightly elevate midline position ( side supine ) first 168 hour ( HOL ) recommend one 10 potentially good practice reduce incidence IVH preterm infant . To best knowledge , systematically collect clinical data quantify relationship IVH head position preterm infant . However , midline head position may challenge well-known right neonatal head position preference . This preference continue 3-6 month age , preterm neonate keep head mainly midline . The best head position preterm neonate still determine . Therefore , investigator aim conduct large scale multicenter randomize control trial order answer follow research question : Does keep head preterm infant le 30 week gestation flat midline ( FM ) throughout first 168 HOL reduce risk IVH compare right flat lateral ( rFL ) ? We hypothesize keep head preterm infant le 30 week gestation FM throughout first 168 HOL would reduce risk IVH compare rFL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Risk Intraventricular Hemorrhage With Flat Midline Versus Right-Tilted Flat Lateral Head Positions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators randomly assign infant lie flat ( zero degree ) bed care either supine FM supine rFL head position throughout first 168 HOL . Investigators mount sign incubator indicate assign head position maintain first 168 HOL . The goal keep neonate ' head assign position throughout first 168 HOL unless medical indication require change position . The left flat lateral head position back-up position whenever medical condition study neonate preclude maintain assign head position . The bedside nurse check correctness infant ' head position every 4 hour use built-in spirit ( bubble ) level open-bed incubator L-shaped ruler . Investigators go use elbow connector HUDSON RCI circuit ( adult circuit ) case SENSORMEDICS require neonate FM group . Investigators watch record pressure ulcer technical difficulty arise use high-frequency ventilation ( HFV ) infants FM position . After first 168 HOL , study infant give routine nursing care provide NICU , include change head position every 6-12 hour need slightly elevate bed . For obvious reason , medical team unmask assign head position . It leave physician discretion controversial/diversity issue ( ) neonatal care record . Timing HUS examination 1 . All study neonates two screen head ultrasound ( HUS ) follow : 1 . Within first 12 HOL . 2 . At 168 HOL . 2 . Otherwise , investigator carry HUS accord establish IVH diagnosis guideline : 1 . As early clinical suspicion IVH raise . 2 . When IVH detect , follow HUS repeat within 5-7 day later . Diagnosis IVH : Ultrasound technician physician train perform HUS perform standard set HUS view anterior fontanel high-quality modern real-time portable ultrasound machine appropriate transducer . They capture least six coronal five sagittal plane . Investigators send similar digital format copy image earlier image ( ) three study pediatric radiologist blind head position assignment . They independently report absence presence , lateralization ( right , left bilateral ) , extension , grade IVH accord Papile 's grading criterion . They send report principal investigator via email . If report inconsistent , diagnosis grade IVH base majority consensus among majority reach . Analysis strategy withdrawal , drop out , protocol violation follow appropriate : 1 . Intention treat analysis . 2 . Per protocol analysis : Including neonate normal first 12 hour life HUS , complete study develop IVH study period , head keep assigned head position throughout study period ( first 168 HOL ) time IVH diagnosis .</detailed_description>
