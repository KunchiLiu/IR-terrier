	<brief_title>Effects Su-Huang Antitussive Capsule Cough Variant Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study group : 60 patient diagnosed CVA randomise two group follow : Group 1 : Su-Huang antitussive capsule The patient cough variant asthma receive Su-Huang antitussive capsule ( 0.45g ) 3 capsule Tid 2 week ( swallow warm water 0.5-1h meal ) . Group 2 : placebo The patient cough variant asthma receive placebo 3 capsule Tid 2 week ( swallow warm water 0.5-1h meal ) . The study divide follow phase : 1 . First Visit ( Visit , day -14 ) : A full medical history physical examination undertaken determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . After informed consent sign , follow sample obtain patient : blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology , biochemistry electrocardiogram , chest x-ray ) . A urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential . Spirometry methacholine bronchial provocation test perform determine presence bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness . 2 . Screening Period ( day -14 day 0 , 14 Days ) Patients take medication corticosteroid , β2 agonist , inhaled sodium cromoglycate . 3 . Second Visit ( Visit 1 , Week 0 ) : Patients give Diary Card . A physical examination perform . All laboratory test result obtain determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Concurrent medication record . Capsaicin challenge test FENO perform hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take enrolled patient . Enrolled patient randomize different group , study medication dispense . 4 . During Treatment 1 ( Week 0 Week 1 , 7 day ) : Patients take study medication 14 day complete Diary Card 7 day Week 0 Week 1 . 5 . Third Visit ( Visit 2 , Week 1 ) : A physical examination perform . The Diary Card collect review . Adverse event , secondary complication , concurrent medication record . The Diary Card collect , review assessed whether treatment efficient cough symptom ( symptom score improve 1 least ) . 6 . During Treatment 2 ( Week 1 Week 2 , 7 day ) : Patients take study medication 14 day complete Diary Card 7 day Week 1 Week 2 . Spirometry bronchial provocation test methacholine inhalation , electro-cardiogram , capsaicin challenge test FENO perform hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take enrolled patient . Blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology biochemistry ) obtain , clinically significant laboratory abnormal result note visit 2 , AE follow-up visit would consider .</detailed_description>
