	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation program improve mortality , functional capacity , quality life , variety patient heart disease . It stand reason patient LVADs might therefore also benefit structured exercise training , education , clinical surveillance . One potential benefit cardiac rehabilitation patient population reversal skeletal muscle atrophy occur due extend period poor peripheral perfusion ( i.e . implantation ) prolong sedentary behavior . Purpose : The purpose propose study examine effect 6-week exercise program cardiorespiratory fitness , quality life , device flow rate patient recently implant LVADs . Methods : 30 patient recently implant LVADs refer Henry Ford Hospital Advanced Heart Failure Program patient deem appropriate exercise . Before enrollment cardiac rehabilitation patient undergo six minute walk test grade exercise stress test treadmill determine exercise capacity . Additionally , quality life questionnaire give . Following stress test , patient randomize ( 2 1 ratio ) either cardiac rehabilitation control . Those chosen control group encourage maintain daily activity ; rehabilitation group partake 6 week standard cardiac rehabilitation program . This consist 3 day week supervise exercise well education regard diet lifestyle modification . At 6 week randomization group undergo fitness assessment retake quality life questionnaire .</brief_summary>
