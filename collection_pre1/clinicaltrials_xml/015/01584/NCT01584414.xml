	<brief_summary>Zetiq introduce histochemical stain claim tinctorially identify cancer neoplastic cell . Because potential importance capability , investigator undertake investigate Zetiq 's CellDetect® stain technology apply culture cell line well initial sample clinical case . This goal pursue investigate four type comparison : 1 ) cancer cell line differentiation ; 2 ) cervical squamous-cell carcinoma ( SCC ) biopsies non-neoplastic squamous epithelium ; 3 ) SCCs neoplastic , nonmalignant squamous epithelium ; 4 ) neoplastic squamous cell non-neoplastic squamous cell cytological preparation . The clinical material also stain hematoxylin eosin ( biopsy ) Pap ( cytology ) diagnostic purpose . The investigator find CellDetect®-stained cell exhibit one two tinctorial outcome . Cell line malignant phenotype uniformly red/purple cytoplasm , whereas differentiate phenotype change color blue/green .</brief_summary>
