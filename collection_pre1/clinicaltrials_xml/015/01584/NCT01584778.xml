	<brief_title>Behçet 's Disease Eosinophil Cationic Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behçet 's disease ( BD ) systemic vasculitis , characterize recurrent oral aphthae , genital ulcer , uveitis , skin lesion , arthritis , gastrointestinal neurologic manifestation . There grow interest research pathogenesis disease . Eosinophils implicate vascular injury associate several vasculitis syndrome like Churg Strauss syndrome , temporal arteritis Henoch-Schonlein purpura . In Behçet patient , serum IgE eosinophil report comparable control eosinophil activity study extensively . Eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) matrix protein specific granule eosinophils considerable capacity damage tissue cell report reflect eosinophil activity . Increased serum level ECP report patient seasonal allergic rhinitis . Several immunomodulatory feature ECP report , inhibition proliferative T-lymphocyte response antigen , immunoglobulin production , proliferation plasma cell line upregulation ICAM-1 . Procoagulant effect ECP also report . The present study conduct patient without usage confound drug effect serum ECP level . The purpose study investigate serum ECP level BD relation clinical activity . Forty-seven consecutive patient BD ( 22 active , 25 inactive ) meeting International Study Group Criteria , 21 age sex match patient allergic rhinitis 21 apparently healthy control evaluate prospectively Rheumatology-Immunology Outpatient Clinic . Clinical activity define accord criterion propose `` Behcet 's Disease Research Committee Japan '' . Activity score make accord `` Behçet 's Disease Research Committee Japan '' propose 1994 . Organ involvement patient summarize . Patients corticosteroids immunosuppressive exclude . Colchicine stop 10 day prior blood collection inactive patient . Blood drawn active patient start treatment . Cases allergy history parasitosis exclude .</detailed_description>
