	<brief_summary>Despite advance treatment heart attack complication death rate failure heart pump properly treatment remain high . A heart attack occur one artery supply blood heart become block , cause heart starve oxygen nutrient . This result damage heart heart pump less well . The main treatment heart attack balloon treatment open block artery ( call primary angioplasty ) . Whilst re-opening artery essential allow blood flow area heart starve oxygen , process also cause damage ( call reperfusion injury ) increase size heart attack . Currently treatments available reduce reperfusion injury . The investigator others show substance call sodium nitrite reduces reperfusion injury experimental model heart attack . The aim research perform trial investigate whether heart attack , infusion sodium nitrite damage artery protect reperfusion injury reduces heart attack size patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Intra-coronary Nitrite Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease still common cause death UK ( main consequence acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ) . Presently , timely effective reperfusion primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) remain effective treatment strategy limit infarct size , preserve leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , improve clinical outcome patient . However , substantial mortality morbidity rate still persist respect long term outcome . One main determinant prognosis AMI size infarct . Thus , identification additional strategy might decrease infarct size desirable . Evidence pre-clinical study suggest inorganic nitrite administration reduces infarct size animal model AMI . In study aim translate finding man . We test hypothesis patient STEMI undergo PPCI , intra-coronary injection nitrite , initiate prior establishment full reperfusion reduces infarct size prevention ischemia-reperfusion injury .</detailed_description>
