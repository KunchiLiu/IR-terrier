	<brief_title>Pomegranate Reduce Maternal Fetal Oxidative Stress Improve Outcome Pregnancies Complicated With Preterm Premature Rupture Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm premature rupture membranes rupture membrane pregnancy 37 week ' gestation . It occur 3 percent pregnancy cause approximately one third preterm delivery . It lead significant perinatal morbidity , include respiratory distress syndrome , neonatal sepsis , umbilical cord prolapse , placental abruption , fetal death . ( ref ) It increase risk prematurity lead number perinatal neonatal complication , include 1 2 percent risk fetal death . ( 2 ) The latent period , time membrane rupture delivery , generally inversely proportional gestational age PROM occur . For example , one large study ( 3 ) patient term reveal 95 percent patient deliver within approximately one day PROM , whereas analysis study ( 4 ) evaluate patient preterm PROM 16 26 week ' gestation determine 57 percent patient deliver within one week , 22 percent latent period four week Numerous risk factor associate preterm premature rupture membrane , low socioeconomic status , smoker , history sexually transmitted infection , previous preterm delivery , vaginal bleeding , uterine distension ( e.g. , polyhydramnios , choriodecidual infection , many case PPROM associate inflammatory process increase oxidative stress . Intrauterine inflammation may associate , fetal injury preterm birth , low birth weight , cerebral palsy ( 5,6,7,8,9 ) . While treatment PPROM Includes antibiotic aim cope increase oxidative stress inflammation associate PPROM think play important role fetal injury Pomegranate juice contains high concentration vitamin ( C , B1 , B2 , B3 , B5 ) , potassium , Magnesium , Zinc good source polyphenols ( 10 ) . Polyphenols molecules find posse antioxidant property well effect gene expression ( 11 ) . Recent study indicate among food contain polyphenols , juice extract pomegranate high concentration measurable polyphenols ( 12,13 ) . Pomegranates show activity cytokine NF-κB MAP kinases JNK ERK , critical step cascade event lead inflammatory response The NF- κB pathway activate response bacterial infection , may explain effect bacterial infection ( 14 ) . Juice consumption may also inhibit viral infection ( 15 ) . In rat animal model pomegranate juice give dams pregnancy lactation period find neuroprotective agent neonatal mouse brain. ( 16 ) . Recently Tuuli et al publish abstract annual meeting society maternal fetal medicine 2011 , demonstrate pomefranate juice ( 8 oz day ) supplement last two week pregnancy , reduce significantly placental oxidative stress associate delivery compare control . Enhancing activity availability antioxidant may modulate inflammatory response associate PPROM , thereby reduce oxidative stress risk fetus . In study seek determine effect Pomegranate 1. maternal fetal oxidative stress inflammation associate PPROM 2 . On time interval PPROM delivery fetal Ph apger score . Study protocol : All woman admit PPROM receive usual protocol department ( Penibrin two day Erythromycin five day ) After sign approval participate study , blood drawn determine oxidative stress marker ( analyzed delivery ) . The patient continue department routine PPROM protocol . After admission woman divide two group . One group receive The POMx pomegranate 1,000 mg capsule day . The group receive placebo . Both group receive regiment maximum two week deliver occur beforehand . The POMx pomegranate 1,000 mg capsule contain least 800 mg natural polyphenol use pomegranate polyphenol standard comparable mg/8 oz juice . ( attached confirmation Similarity Pomegranate Juice POMx Polyphenols ) The palecbo capsule contain gelatin lactose . The capsuls manufacture hospital pharmacy.All component medically approve fot use pregnancy . During pregnancy : The patient continue usual PPROM protocol . After delivery After delivery baby 1.umbilical blood drawn umbilical cord maternal serum oxidative stress marker Ph C-reactive protein 2 . Histological evaluation placenta inflammation</detailed_description>
