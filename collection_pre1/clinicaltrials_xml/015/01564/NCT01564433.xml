	<detailed_description>Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) describe group chronic condition affect body movement muscle coordination cause damage one area brain , usually occur fetal development infancy . The motor disorder CP often accompany disturbance sensation , cognition , communication , perception , behavior , and/or seizure disorder . One disable mobility impairment CP gait impairment , clinically characterize reduce speed endurance , well reduced step , stride length toe clearance gait . Recently , gait rehabilitation method patient neurological impairment rely technological device , drive patient 's gait body-weight support condition emphasize beneficial role repetitive practice . The rationale approach originate animal study show repetition gait movement may enhance spinal supraspinal locomotor circuit . Early study gait rehabilitation patient CP carry use partial body-weight support treadmill training ( PBWSTT ) robotic-assisted treadmill therapy . The majority study consist single case , small unselected patient sample and/or uncontrolled trial . In recent randomize control trial study , Willoughby et al . show PBWSTT effective overground walk improve walk speed endurance child CP . They conclude progressive reduction body weight support along add concurrent overground walk practice treadmill train protocol may increase intensity train assist carry improvement overground walk . Despite potential , technology practical limitation routine application : PBWSTT require assistance one two physiotherapist control patient 's weight shift lower limb position train proper placement patient onto machine ( Lokomat , Hokoma Inc. , Volketswill , Switzerland ) robotic-assisted treadmill train time-consuming . More recently , several study focus use new electromechanical gait trainer ( Gait Trainer GT I ; Reha-Stim , Berlin , Germany ) adult patient experience stroke . They show train device may significantly improve gait performance . Despite clinical impact new rehabilitative procedure , date , study conduct use child CP . The primary aim present randomize control trial evaluate whether repetitive locomotor train Gait Trainer GT I improve endurance tetra- diplegic ambulatory child CP . The secondary aim ass whether training also positive impact spatiotemporal gait parameter quality life . Study Design Randomised control , blind clinical trial . Materials method Twenty CP patient enrol study . The inclusion criterion : bilateral low limb ( diplegic tetraplegic ) CP , 10 18 year age , GMFCS level II IV , walk use assistance device least 10 meter , maintain sit position without assistance follow instruction participate rehabilitative program . The exclusion criterion : low limb spasticity &gt; 2 Modified Ashworth Scale , severe low limb contracture , cardiovascular disease , orthopedic surgery neurosurgery past 12 month Botulinum toxin injection within 6 month begin study . At moment recruitment ( treatment ) , end treatment ( 6 week ) one month two month end treatment ( FU ) patient test follow clinical instrumental procedure . Clinical assessment procedure : 6-minute Walking Test , Ten Meter Walking Test , Gross Motor Classification System , Child Health Questionnaire ( CHQ-PF50 ) Italian version , Wee FIM Energy Expenditure Index . Instrumental assessment procedure : Gait analysis mean GAITRite® System measure energy cost COSMED K4b2 . As primary outcome measure consider 6-minute Walking Distance Test . As secondary outcome measure consider Ten Meter Walking Test , Gross Motor Classification System , Child Health Questionnaire ( CHQ-PF50 ) Italian version , Wee FIM Energy Expenditure Index , Spatio-temporal parameter GAITRite® System measure energy cost COSMED K4b2 . The allocation two group do simple randomisation . Patients randomize two group . The first group ( experimental group ) subject 12 treatment session ( 3 sessions/week ) Gait Trainer machine one month . The second group ( control group ) undergo conventional treatment duration frequency experimental group . Data analyse mean parametric non-parametric test . Both , within group comparison perform . Data analyze use SPSS software ( ver 11.0 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .</detailed_description>
