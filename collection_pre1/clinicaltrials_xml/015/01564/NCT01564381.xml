	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause morbidity mortality United States . To reduce risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) associate health care cost , nutrition health recommendation strongly advocate consumption diet rich fruit vegetable . In addition essential vitamin mineral , fruit vegetable contain number bioactive compound may involve vascular function . The `` French Paradox '' refers diet pattern , despite high saturate fat , associate relatively low cardiovascular risk . An important aspect many diet identify French Paradox study significant intake wine , particularly red wine , contain array phytochemical postulate improve cardiovascular health . A polyphenolic receive particular attention regard resveratrol . The stilbene resveratrol find predominately red grape , red wine , peanuts berry , tout popular press potential health-promoting benefit . Emerging evidence suggest role resveratrol protection numerous degenerative health problem include CVD certain cancer , diabetes form neurodegeneration . The amount resveratrol food low ; thus obtain amount compound associate improved health animal model difficult human . ResA product produce use patented technology physically bind resveratrol arginine , create novel conjugate . In preliminary study ResA conjugate produce high peak plasma level , well total plasma level persist long period time fed rat . Whether similar result would occur human , extent increase blood resveratrol concentration associate positive cardiovascular effect at-risk population subject project .</detailed_description>
