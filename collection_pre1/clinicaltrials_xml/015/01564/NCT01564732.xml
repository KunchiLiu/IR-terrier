	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare plicate laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( PLAGB ) standard laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( SLAGB ) prospective randomize clinical trial . We hypothesize plicated procedure provide great short- long-term excess weight loss standard procedure . There exist little prospective randomize data regard topic recent position statement American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( ASMBS ) encourage type study . Further information background design study provide detailed description .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morbid obesity major problem affect life million US . As 2008 , overall prevalence obesity define body mass index ( BMI ) great 30 kg/m2 33.8 % .1 Obesity adversely affect life million Americans increase risk co-morbid condition diabetes mellitus , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , even certain cancers.2-4 The laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) procedure safe , effective , durable treatment option refractory morbid obesity relate health consequences.5 This minimally invasive technique popular approach bariatric surgery , offer obvious advantage decrease operating time , short hospital stay ( often day surgery ) , favorable complication rate compare bariatric procedures.4,5 One big drawback LAGB [ compare 'gold standard ' bariatric surgery : Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ] patient tend slow , less dramatic weight loss first month surgery.5-7 In addition , LAGB procedure associate approximate 3 % chance `` band slippage '' complications.8 In order address issue modification technique LAGB surgery make . Techniques `` pars-flaccida approach '' tissue dissection placement plication suture `` anchor '' redundant stomach around newly place band device introduce show positive result reduce band complication rates.8 More recently , sleeve gastrostomy procedure ( great curvature significant portion body stomach resect size bougie ; leave narrow 'sleeve ' stomach ) also become popular treating patient morbid obesity.9 Combining concept , modify technique plicate LAGB introduce . At time LAGB placement , plication suture place along body &amp; great curvature stomach `` tighten '' `` cinch '' stomach sleeve-like orientation . It recently report modified technique plicate LAGB could result low band slippage complication rate faster , early weight loss.8 However , today exists prospective , randomize study compare outcomes modified surgical technique standard procedure ( SLAGB ) . This prospective randomized clinical trial compare PLAGB versus SLAGB . All adult ( age old 18 year ) morbidly obese patient meet NIH criterion bariatric surgery ( BMI &gt; 35 + co-morbid disease BMI &gt; 40 ) undergo bariatric surgery Duke Metabolic Weight Loss Surgery Center University Pittsburgh Medical Center recruit . All enrol patient randomly assign either SLAGB ( control ) group PLAGB ( study ) group . Variables study include patient age , gender , ethnicity , co-morbid disease condition , height , weight , BMI , intra-operative data operative time blood loss , post-operative outcome include length hospital stay , complication rate , weight loss , co-morbid disease resolution . In addition , patient complete standardize survey rating satisfaction surgery , quality life ( OWL-QOL-17 ) , sleepiness ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) three distinct time interval : pre-operatively week 24 &amp; 48 . Each subject follow data collect accord follow schedule visit : Study Visit Schedule : Year 1 : Visit 1 : Screening Visit Visit 2 : Day 0 ( surgery ) Visit 3 : Week 2 ( +/- 2 day ) Visit 4 : Week 4 ( 1 month ) Visit 5 : Week 8 ( 2 month ) Visit 6 : Week 12 ( 3 month ) Visit 7 : Week 16 ( 4 month ) Visit 8 : Week 20 ( 5 month ) Visit 9 : Week 24 ( 6 month ) Visit 10 : Week 30 Visit 11 : Week 36 Visit 12 : Week 42 Visit 13 : Week 48 Year 2 : Visit 14 : Week 60 Visit 15 : Week 72 Visit 16 : Week 84 Visit 17 : Week 96 Year 3 : Visit 18 : Week 128 ( 2.5 yr ) Visit 19 : Week 156 ( 3 yr ) Data gather PLAGB subject compare SLAGB control . Pre- post-operative care deliver consistent establish protocol standard practice ; without regard surgical approach . This include standard preoperative evaluation patient education period follow surgery . After surgery , patient usually discharge hospital within first 24 hour . Follow-up patient include initial post-discharge clinic visit within first 2 week , subsequent visit schedule time interval list . Subjects follow period approximately 12 month . This study compare modify bariatric surgical approach . PLAGB study compare SLAGB procedure prospective randomize clinical trial . Please note : Per FDA approve modification 6/18/2014 , study specific test eliminate , safety assessment complete surgical office 6 month 1 year surgery .</detailed_description>
