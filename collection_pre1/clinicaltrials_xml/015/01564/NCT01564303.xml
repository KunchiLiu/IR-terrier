	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : More study focus strategy preserve tissue mitochondrion subsequently maintain normal organ function [ 62 ] . One strategy use Carnitine . Carnitine first describe early beginning 20th century . In human , 75 % carnitine obtain diet [ 63 ] , whereas rest synthesize two essential amino acid , lysine methionine kidney , liver brain [ 64 ] . Carnitine transport long-chain acyl group fatty acid mitochondrial matrix , broken β-oxidation acytl-coenzyme-A obtain energy balance across cell membrane tissue derive much energy fatty acid oxidation cardiac skeletal muscle [ 66,67 ] . Plasma concentration free carnitine dynamic balance acylcarnitines acyl free carnitine ratio ≤ 0.4 consider normal [ 65 ] , however , uremic patient , balance disrupt , ratio alter large amount free carnitine esterify acyl-carnitine `` buffer '' excess acyl group , modulate bound CoA free CoA [ 68 ] . This may cause several metabolic disturbance cellular level , include impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation energy production , accumulation toxic acyl moiety , inhibition key enzymes metabolic pathway [ 69 ] . These metabolic abnormality may lead several clinical alteration often observe patient , muscle weakness myopathy , loss body protein cachexia , insulin resistance glucose intolerance , plasma lipid abnormality , anemia refractory erythropoietin ( EPO ) treatment , cardiomyopathy , intradialytic symptom [ 70,71,72 ] . Thus , imbalanced acyl/free carnitine ratio may explain high risk patient chronic renal failure CIAKI . However , Carnitine supplementation may contribute regeneration sequestrate free CoA maintain normal metabolic process [ 66,67 ] . Experimental study show L-propionylcarnitine , propionyl ester L-carnitine , able prevent cyclosporine ( immunosuppressive agent follow organ transplantation ) induce acute nephrotoxicity , reduce lipid peroxidation significantly lower blood pressure . L-propionylcarnitine prevented decline creatinine clearance cyclosporine chronically treat animal [ 73 ] . Patients treat carnitine display improved physical performance treatment-related chronic fatigue , cardiovascular disease , cancer , diabetes , chronic syndrome , cause impaired carnitine production kidney disease [ 36-38 ] . In last decade increase report describe beneficial use carnitine well energy metabolism ( mitochondrial metabolism ) . Carnitine increase albumin protein level , restore antioxidant defense , improve nutritional status , cardiac , vascular smooth muscle , muscular function [ 39-42 ] . The postulated beneficial effect carnitine treatment direct lipid towards oxidation ATP production . Another possible protective effect carnitine contrast medium induce lesion ability suppress development oxidative stress free radical generation [ 74 ] . Free radical , particular hydroxyl radical , lead lipid peroxidation cell membrane , cause degradation phospholipid , result increase production renal vasoconstrictor [ 75 ] . It emphasize carnitine available medication approve FDA treat secondary deficiency due metabolic disease . Intravenous administration carnitine safe , pharmacokinetics analyze know pre-dose level plasma [ 76 ] . Further , single-dose intravenous administration ( 0.5 g ) acetyl-L-carnitine , rapidly , completely hydrolyze , acetyl-L-carnitine L-carnitine concentration return baseline within 12 hour . Even high dos ; intravenous dos high 300 mg/kg administer apparent toxicity . However , commonly report adverse effect nonserious include gastritis , diarrhea , body odor . The beneficial carnitine supply extensively evaluated animal human last 20 year . As result , several expert already aim revise clinical evidence support therapeutic use . In Addition light grow experimental evidence beneficial effect carnitine antioxidant beneficial modulator mitochondrial energy expenditure , tempt explore possibility carnitine may exert nephroprotective effect CIAKI . Hypothesis 2 : Another new upraising strategy use attenuate renal injury experimental study use phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitor agent [ 77 , 78 ] . PDE5 inhibitor approve FDA erectile dysfunction pulmonary hypertension . The latter find exert significant antiapoptotic effect renal tubular cell expose partial unilateral ureteral obstruction [ 79 ] . Part physiological process PDE5 inhibition involve release nitric oxide ( NO ) . Brando et al . link increase available pool cyclic 3,5 guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) phosphodiesterases inhibitor prevention ameliorate chronic renal damage mainly attenuate hypertension retard progression renal disease [ 80 ] . Furthermore PDE 5 inhibitor demonstrate able ameliorate nephrotoxicity . Noami H. et al . show FR226807 , selective PDE5 inhibitor , ameliorate cyclosporine A nephrotoxicity increase cGMP content [ 81 ] . These observation may relevance contrast medium induce renal injury suggest PDE5 inhibition potential therapeutic approach clinical entity . In sum , CIAKI common iatrogenic . Up date suggest treatment CIAKI partially effective approve Food Drug Administration yet . The lack effective nephroprotective drug CIAKI , emphasize need additional new drug also new strategy might also clarify CIAKI pathophysiology . To best knowledge , potentially beneficial effect carnitine PDE5 inhibitor CIAKI prevention examine , far .</detailed_description>
