	<detailed_description>About 20 percent woman diagnose uterine cancer spread outside uterus , mainly lymph node . If metastasis recognize woman still cure chemotherapy radiation . Unfortunately different kind image sensitive identifying patient lymph node metastasis currently complete removal lymph node pelvis around aorta gold standard diagnostic test . Sentinel node biopsy ( SLNB ) surgical technique aim identify node drain specifically area tumor locate . A tracer inject around tumor locoregional lymph node test presence tracer ( blue dye radioactive substance ) . If sentinel lymph node contain cancer , high likelihood cancer spread area body.The benefit sentinel node biopsy decrease potential complication associate removal lymph node . This technique standard treatment cancer breast cancer melanoma emerge promising technique gynecological cancer . There agreement regard best technique SLNB woman uterine cancer procedure still stage determine feasibility . Since 1996 , publication aim determine appropriate way sentinel node uterine cancer . As uterus reach preoperatively tracer injection , standard approach tumor sit preoperative peritumoral injection Technetium 99 follow intraoperative injection blue dye need modify . Blue dye without radiocolloid administer either subserously ( uterus outer layer ) , cervically , dually , hysteroscopically wide range result term identification rate sentinel node . Certain factor site injection , volume number injection , interval time since injection identification sentinel nod surgical approach laparotomy versus laparoscopy associate likelihood identify node . This study plan determine pattern lymphatic drainage cervix corpus uterus inject different tracer 2 site also incorporate factor prove associated good identification rate sentinel node protocol order determine technique feasible reliable .</detailed_description>
