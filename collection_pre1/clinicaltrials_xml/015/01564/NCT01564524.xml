	<brief_summary>Traumatic facial injury , especially sustained military combat , characterize destruction bone soft tissue . While bony structure face reconstruct , difficult return soft tissue back original form . Many time , fat grafting , common cosmetic reconstructive procedure , use hope improve soft tissue deformity . Fat graft procedure person 's fat take area throughout body , usually thighs abdomen , small liposuction tube . The fat transferred area lose volume fullness . The fullness soft tissue area may decrease time transfer fat reabsorb body . Altering current fat grafting procedure , slightly , could lead less reabsorption last fullness soft tissue area outcome fat graft procedure . We conduct research study help u improve surgical treatment people suffer facial soft tissue loss result trauma . The goal research study see person 's fat graft maintain fat time measure quality life 9 month post-surgical follow-up period . The total duration participation approximately 11 month . In study , concentrate fat fat grafting procedure determine whether process maintain fat time . The area treat enhanced fat graft compare area treat standard care fat graft . At least two area face treat fat graft , ( standard care fat graft concentrate fat graft ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Craniofacial injury serious psychosocial sequele affect quality life . Many individual suffer significant facial disfigurement injury experience psychological distress impairment function limited acute phase injury , long term period treatment , recovery , adjustment . Until recently , treatment disfigure craniofacial injury mostly limit surgical flap procedure , microsurgical tissue transfer , implantable prosthesis . However , method leave conspicuous scar face donor site , case implant lead complication associate foreign material . Autologous fat graft minimally invasive cannula procedure use decade common plastic surgery practice facial aesthetic procedure . This technique also promise treatment soft tissue reconstruction craniofacial trauma graft harvest injection minimally invasive . The treatment perform use small liposuction cannula aspirate fat tissue donor site , re-injecting fat recipient site specialize injection cannula . After harvest , prior injection , fat graft subject mechanical process step separate aqueous layer concentrate adipocytes . This often take form centrifugation filtering . The main problem autologous fat graft variable resorption graft volume time . As much 30-60 % graft volume diminish time . Many variable may influence behavior clinical fat graft , include harvest site , harvest technique , graft preparation , injection technique . In current IRB approve study fat grafting ( IRB # PRO09060101 ) , seek accurately quantify fat graft resorption time follow highly standardized surgical technique . Evaluation method include 3D surface imaging , high resolution CT scanning , quality life measure . This study enrol treated patient without adverse event , evaluation method perform successfully . In proposed study , plan use essentially surgical procedure evaluation method , modify preparation fat graft . This modified preparation involve concentrate endogenous stromal cell graft material effort increase graft retention time . The aspirated fat material use fat graft consist mature adipocytes , small amount fibrous tissue , immature adipose stromal cell . These adipose stromal cell ( ASCs ) mixed population non-lipid laden cell serve turn mature adipocytes vascular element . `` Preadipocytes , '' well endothelial precursor cell multilineage progenitor cell , find . Of note , ASCs show stimulate angiogenesis stress hypoxic condition cell may instrumental healing volume retention fat graft . Yoshimura , et . al . ( 1 ) find fat aspirate liposuction cannula ( i.e . method fat harvest fat graft ) deficient ASCs compare whole fat . This due fact major portion ASCs locate around large blood vessel leave intact donor site liposuction blunt cannula .</detailed_description>
