	<detailed_description>Background Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) common chronic disable disease central nervous system young adult . Gait disorder represent one great cause disability patient MS . Thus , gait restoration patient MS one primary objective rehabilitation often influence whether patient return home work . Despite significant progress development disease-modifying drug , pharmacologic therapy alone warrant optimal care MS . Exercise recognize feasible form self-management person disease . Regular exercise improve daily activity , cardiovascular fitness , muscle strength , health perception , reduce fatigue patient MS. To restore gait , modern concept rehabilitation support repetitive task-specific approach . In recent year also show high intensity walk practice ( result repetition train ) result well outcome patient stroke . Recently , introduction robotic device gait rehabilitation show feasible approach order improve gait ability patient stroke spinal cord lesion . These device allow train patient graduate body weight support condition guide patient 's step reproduce physiologic gait pattern long clinical condition allow . This activity execute require supervision physiotherapist absolutely safety condition patient . Repetitive locomotor training innovative approach gait disturbance patient multiple sclerosis . Only scant data issue available study perform mean conventional physiotherapy treadmill train approach . Nowadays effectiveness robotic device gait rehabilitation yet evaluate patient multiple sclerosis . Aim study The aim study evaluate effect repetitive locomotor train electromechanical gait trainer gait endurance , fatigue activity daily life patient MS. Study Design Randomised control , blind clinical trial . Materials method Fifty patient definite diagnosis MS accord McDonald criterion , EDSS score equal 7 enrol study . Patients disease recurrence worsen significantly 8 week recruitment exclude . At moment recruitment ( treatment ) , end treatment ( 6 week ) one month end treatment ( FU ) patient test follow clinical instrumental procedure . Clinical assessment procedure : 6-minute Walking Test , 10-meter Walking Test , Fatigue Severity Scale , Multiple Sclerosis Quality Of Life-54 , Hamilton Rating Scale Depression , Falls Efficacy Scale . Instrumental assessment procedure : GAITRite® System , Stabilometric Assessment measure energy cost COSMED K4b2 . As primary outcome measure consider 6-minute Walking Distance Test . As secondary outcome measure consider 10-meter Walking Test , Fatigue Severity Scale Multiple Sclerosis Quality Of Life-54 , Hamilton Rating Scale Depression , Falls Efficacy Scale , Spatio-temporal parameter GAITRite® System , Stabilometric Assessment measure energy cost COSMED K4b2 . The allocation two group do simple randomisation . Patients randomize two group . The first group ( experimental group ) subject 12 treatment session ( 2 sessions/week ) Gait Trainer machine . The second group ( control group ) undergo conventional treatment duration frequency experimental group . Data analyse mean parametric non-parametric test . Both , within group comparison perform . Data analyze use SPSS software ( ver 11.0 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Expected result : could hypothesize training performed experimental group could improve gait endurance daily life disability patient MS .</detailed_description>
