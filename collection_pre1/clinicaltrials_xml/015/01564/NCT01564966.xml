	<brief_title>Cardiovascular-Renal Consequences Reducing Renal Mass After Living Kidney Donation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal dysfunction associate accelerate cardiovascular disease even kidney function mildly impair . Besides , even level urinary albumin excretion accept threshold microalbuminuria associate increase cardiovascular risk , risk increase degree proteinuria rise . - Live-donor kidney transplantation generally consider best choice patient renal failure await transplantation , kidney function good kidney decease donor , wait time deceased-donor transplant long . Although several study show kidney donation low short-term morbidity mortality , data long-term outcomes much less complete . The short long term renal function donor kidney donation much study still remain uncertain , cardiovascular effect reduction renal mass kidney donor also clearly know . - Endothelial dysfunction ( ED ) first step subsequent development atherosclerosis , help u assess cardiovascular change kidney donation . Prospectively examine endothelial consequence uninephrectomy donor may provide useful insight existence pathophysiology cardiovascular disease donor , therefore , cardiovascular disease risk associate renal impairment might eventually reduce .</detailed_description>
