	<brief_summary>The giant cell tumor ( GTC ) aggressive benign bone tumor , grow metaphyseal-epiphyseal region long bone , especially around knee distal radius.It responsible bony destruction para-articular zone fracture lead breakdown destruction underlie joint . Histologically , tumor cell contain contingent monocytic cell round , contingent giant type cell type osteoclastic responsible bone resorption accompany tumor contingent lengthen cell fibroblast-like consider contingent tumor . The treatment exclusively surgical ; resection lesion take away tumour environment , solution , prevent local recurrence , impose important bony articular reconstruction , always limit deteriorate rapidly time young patient ; curettage lesion , `` hollowing-out '' bone , create hole necessary fill bony graft substitute bone ( cement ) . This last solution , preserve good function , expose risk local recurrence , put play prognosis articulation near , often knee.Despite different local adjuvant treatment use surgical operation , curetted cavity filling , recidivism rate vary 12 % 41 % ( average 25 % ) literature . The beneficial effect adjuvant therapeutic suggest concept broadly accept tumoral microscopic residual origin local recidivism .Biphosphonates ( BP ) molecules settle vivo hydroxyapatite bone ; inhibit recruitment osteoclast forerunner activity mature osteoclast . Besides , biphosphonates contain nitrogen ( N-BP ) , lead apoptose mature osteoclast . These molecule also direct effect tumor cell , cause apoptosis neoplastic cell myeloma , breast cancer . Clinical control study confirm experimental data N-BP . Two work also show effect osteoclast stroma cell tumour giant cell clinical study assess potential prevention local recurrence . The investigator offer study phase 2 effectiveness N-BP ( acid zoledronique ) prevention local recurrence tumour primary huge cell surgical treatment curettage - filing surgeon referent oncologic orthopedic surgery .

	<detailed_description>Outcome Measures : - Main : occurrence recurrence detectable Reasonable Magnetic Imaging ( IRM ) / standardize radiography . Local recurrence discuss presence appearance radiographic IRM monitoring osteolysis periphery cavity curetted , exist radio post-operative IRM signal abnormality location , take gadolinium . If doubt , new surgical biopsy confirm diagnosis local recurrence secondary : - clinical : patient interview , clinical examination - biological Complete blood count , creatinine , serum calcium , phosphate , magnesium</detailed_description>
