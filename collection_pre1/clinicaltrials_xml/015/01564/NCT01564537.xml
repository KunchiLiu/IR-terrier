	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether addition oral ixazomib background therapy lenalidomide dexamethasone improve progression free survival ( PFS ) participant relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Comparing Oral Ixazomib Plus Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Versus Placebo Plus Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Adult Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Ixazomib . Ixazomib test treat people relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) . This study look progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) safety participant take ixazomib addition lenalidomide dexamethasone compare placebo addition lenalidomide dexamethasone . The study enrol 722 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Ixazomib 4 mg + lenalidomide + dexamethasone - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient + lenalidomide + dexamethasone All participant receive treatment 28 day cycle disease progression unacceptable toxicity . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study approximately 80 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact every 4 week PFS every 12 week OS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female participant 18 year age old . 2 . Multiple myeloma diagnose accord standard criterion either currently time initial diagnosis . NOTE : The initial diagnosis must symptomatic multiple myeloma , although relapse disease need symptomatic . 3 . Must measurable disease , define least 1 follow 3 measurement : Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L ) . Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hour . Serum free light chain ( FLC ) assay : involve FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dL ( ≥ 100 mg/L ) , provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . 4 . Participants relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) receive 1 3 prior therapy . NOTE : population include follow 3 category participant : Participants relapse previous treatment ( ) refractory previous treatment . Participants refractory line previous treatment ( ) ( ie , participant never respond therapy receive ) . Participants relapse least 1 previous treatment AND additionally refractory least 1 previous treatment . For purpose study , refractory disease define disease progression treatment progression within 60 day last dose give therapy . A line therapy define 1 cycle plan treatment program . This may consist 1 planned cycle singleagent therapy combination therapy , well sequence treatment administer planned manner . For example , plan treatment approach induction therapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation , follow maintenance consider 1 line therapy . Autologous allogenic transplant permit . 5 . Must meet follow clinical laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm^3 platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^3 . Platelet transfusion help participant meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day prior randomization . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 x ULN . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min NOTE : Participants low creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min ( ≤ 50 mL/min , accord lenalidomide prescribing information/local practice ) receive reduce lenalidomide dose 10 mg daily ( QD ) Days 1 21 28day cycle . The lenalidomide dose may escalate 15 mg QD 2 cycle participant respond treatment tolerate treatment . If renal function normalize ( ie , creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min &gt; 50 mL/min , accord lenalidomide prescribing information/local practice ) participant continue tolerate treatment , lenalidomide may escalate 25 mg QD . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 7 . Participants receive prior allogenic transplant must active graftversushost disease . 8 . Female participant : Were postmenopausal least 24 month screen visit , OR Were surgically sterile , OR If childbearing potential must : negative pregnancy test sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior start Cycle 1 lenalidomide ; either agree practice true abstinence , line prefer usual lifestyle participant . ( Periodic abstinence [ eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) OR begin 2 reliable method birth control ( 1 highly effective method 1 additional effective method ) time , least 28 day start study treatment 90 day last dose study treatment ; agree ongoing pregnancy test AND must also adhere guideline RevAssist program ( US participant ) , RevAid program ( Canadian participant ) , iAccess program ( Australian participant ) , RevMate program ( Japanese participant ) The Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan outline Study Manual ( participant use commercial supply ) . Male patient , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status postvasectomy ) , : Agreed practice true abstinence , line prefer usual lifestyle participant . ( Periodic abstinence [ eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) OR Agreed practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 90 day last dose study treatment partner childbearing potential , even successful vasectomy , AND Must also adhere guideline RevAssist program ( US participant ) , RevAid program ( Canadian participant ) , iAccess program ( Australian participant ) , RevMate program ( Japanese participant ) The Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan outline study Manual ( participant use commercial supply ) 9 . Must able take concurrent aspirin 81 325 mg daily ( enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily [ equivalent ] allergic aspirin ) , per publish standard institutional standard care , prophylactic anticoagulation . NOTE : For participant prior history deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , lowmolecularweight heparin ( LMWH ) mandatory . 10 . Voluntary write consent must give performance study relate procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw participant time without prejudice future medical care . 11 . Was willing able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 1 . Was refractory lenalidomide proteasome inhibitorbased therapy line . NOTE : Refractory disease define disease progression treatment progression within 60 day last dose give therapy . Participants progress 60 day last dose give therapy consider relapse eligible inclusion study . Participants refractory thalidomidebased therapy eligible . 2 . Female participant breast feed pregnant . 3 . Failure fully recover ( ie , Grade 1 toxicity ) effect prior chemotherapy ( except alopecia ) regardless interval since last treatment . 4 . Major surgery within 14 day randomization . 5 . Radiotherapy within 14 day randomization . 6 . Central nervous system involvement . 7 .
