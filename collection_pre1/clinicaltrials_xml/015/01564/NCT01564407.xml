	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety ICX-RHY-013 treatment stable , restrictive scar subject suffer burn injury . Evaluation achieve regular assessment adverse event , vital sign , blood work monitor laboratory analysis cellular property scar biopsy . The secondary objective study evaluate improvement symptom scar include reduced pain , discomfort itching , improvement mobility daily function , improvement appearance scar texture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Allogeneic Human Dermal Fibroblasts Remodeling Scar Contractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restrictive scar contracture ( condition tissue thicken tightens , pull surround healthy skin toward damage area ) due serious burn injury result long term aesthetic physical consequence . Skin contractures adjacent joint lead joint deformity severely restrict range motion ( ROM ) affect joint . Skin contractures also often accompany crippling level chronic pain result high level dependency pain medication . These isolated combine factor lead significant disruption social professional life , lead marked impact individual 's quality life . The current standard care restrictive scar contracture involve surgical excision contracture and/ skin grafting . These standard therapy require extensive often repeated surgery . Physicians continually seek less invasive therapy treat patient burn contracture . ICX‐RHY‐013 investigational medicinal product comprise viable allogeneic human dermal fibroblast ( HDFs ) cell suspend HypoThermosol®-FRS . HDFs isolate neonatal foreskin , cryopreserved , thaw expanded culture good manufacturing practice Intercytex Ltd. , United Kingdom . The drug formulation 20 million cell per 1 milliliter HypoThermosol® administer subject via intradermal injection maximum dose 0.25 ml ( 5 million cell ) per cm² tissue . If determine safe effective , believe therapy could , future , deliver series superficial injection carry doctor 's office . This treatment could represent new less invasive therapy choice patient burn contracture , current recourse would surgery . This advance could significant positive benefit patient term : - side-effects surgery - treatment give outpatient environment without need expensive hospitalization - enhance quality life - low cost Cohort 1 consist 4 participant schedule elective body contour surgery consist removal abdominal incision scar . The investigational drug inject exist surgical incision ( scar ) investigational drug , ICX-RHY-013 . The purpose cohort evaluate initial safety investigational drug ( ICX-RHY-013 ) series dose surgical scar surgically remove . Cohorts 2 5 consist 4 participant burn scar restrictive scar contracture . The purpose cohort evaluate ongoing safety investigational drug ( ICX-RHY-013 ) post burn scar restrictive scar contracture . The investigational drug inject directly scar contracture . Each cohort unique dose frequency investigational drug receive different . We evaluate safety drug cohort assess side effect participant may experience .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects male female , military civilian , age 18 65 year age able provide inform consent 2 . Subjects suffer injury occur less 6 week prior screen date result stable restrictive scar contracture 1 . Stable restrictive scar contracture result abdominal surgical incision transverse joint ( Cohort 1 ) . 2 . Stable restrictive scar contracture result burn injury may transverse joint ( Cohorts 25 ) 3 . Subjects minimum scar length 7 cm maximum scar area size 80cm² ( Cohort 1 ) 4 . Subjects minimum scar area size 1cm² maximum scar area size 80cm² ( Cohort 25 ) . 5 . Subjects , opinion Investigator , able understand study , comply study design willing return clinic research require followup visit 1 . Subjects previous use cellular therapy ( e.g . Isolagen ) treatment area 2 . Subjects know history keloid 3 . Subjects know history bleed disorder 4 . Subjects facial restrictive scar deficit , exclude neck area . 5 . Subjects contracturerelease procedure treatment area within previous six month 6 . Subjects know allergy constituent HypoThermosolFRS 7 . Subjects take immunosuppressive therapy include systemic steroid exclude receive dose &gt; 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent/day one week within 90 day first treatment plan immunosuppressive therapy time study ( Intranasal/inhaled steroid acceptable ) 8 . Diagnosis cancer within last 12 month /or actively receive chemotherapy radiation treatment 9 . Subjects life expectancy &lt; 9 month , terminal condition factor make followup difficult ( e.g . fix address , telephone etc ) 10 . Subjects history hypersensitivity additional studyassociated drugs/therapies ( e.g . isopropyl alcohol , EMLA cream , adrenaline , lidocaine , etc ) 11 . Subjects plan major surgical intervention course study . 12 . Subjects know idiopathic drugassociated coagulopathy 13 . Subjects take medicinal product know reduce hemostasis ( e.g . heparin , Coumadin , etc . ) 2 week prior commence treatment plan take medicinal product know reduce hemostasis 12 week study period 14 . Subjects take investigational product within 30 day prior screen plan use investigational product study period . 15 . Subjects pregnant , lactating , plan pregnancy woman childbearing potential abstinent practice acceptable mean contraception , determine Investigator , duration treatment phase 16 . Subjects abnormal blood biochemistry abnormal laboratory find consider clinically significant would deem subject inappropriate surgical procedure , determine investigator ( i.e . CBC Differential , platelet , comprehensive metabolic panel include electrolyte , bun/creatinine , liver function test coagulation test ) . 17 . Subjects , determine investigator history clinical manifestation significant renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , metabolic , neurologic , psychiatric , condition would preclude participation study ( i.e . Type 1 Type 2 diabetic patient ) condition within last 14 day require hospitalization surgical intervention . 18 . Subjects evidence past present clinically significant medical condition would impair wound heal 19 . Subjects know hypersensitivity gentamycin , amphotericin B , Bovine serum porcine product . 20 . Subjects know alcohol narcotic drug dependency 21 . Subjects diagnose autoimmune disorder know affect wound healing , Systemic Lupus Erythematosis ( SLE ) , psoriasis , infection inflammation ( seborrheic dermatitis ) . 22 . Subjects receive immunosuppressive medication regime include transplant antirejection agent . 23 . Subjects Axis II diagnosis DSMIV ( e.g. , Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder ) . Subjects find stable medication receive psychiatric clearance could eligible study participation per Physician 's discretion</criteria>
