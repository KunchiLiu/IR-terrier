	<brief_title>AgION Catheter Preventing Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , silver zeolite-impregnated catheter commercialize . This material , namely patent silver compound AgIONâ„¢ , release antimicrobially active silver ion may help prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection CRBSIs frequent preterm infant . The investigator hypothesize use AgION-impregnated umbilical catheter could decrease occurrence CRBSIs preterm infant . To assess hypothesis investigator carry randomize control study preterm infant need umbilical vein catheter would receive either AgION catheter traditional non-impregnated polyurethane catheter . Infants gestational age &lt; 30 week randomize receive AgION- impregnate non-impregnated polyurethane umbilical venous catheter ( UVC ) open seal opaque envelope . The primary end point incidence CRBSIs time UVC place . The investigator study 86 infant , 41 receive AgION catheter 45 non-impregnated catheter . During umbilical venous catheterization 2 % infant AgION group develop CRBSI comparison 22 % infant control group ( p=0.005 ) . The incidence density CRBSIs study period low infant receive AgION catheter compare control group ( 2.1/1000 catheter day versus 25.8/1000 catheter day ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . The occurrence UVC colonization similar group . The Kaplan-Meier estimate cumulative likelihood free CRBSI day UVC placement demonstrate statistically significant ( p=0.004 ) protective effect AgION impregnate catheter . Moreover , infant AgION group short hospital stay ( p=0.04 ) , low case fatality rate due BSI ( p=0.01 ) infant control group . AgION catheter well tolerate none patient show sign attributable silver toxicity . Multivariate analysis demonstrate non-impregnated catheter use ( OR 12.5 , 95 % C.l . 2.06-75.9 ) catheter placement 7 day ( OR 5.1 , 95 % C.l . 1.13-23.6 ) increase risk develop CRBSI population . Conclusions . The AgION-impregnated UVCs effective decreasing development CRBSIs preterm infant compare non-impregnated polyurethane UVCs .</detailed_description>
