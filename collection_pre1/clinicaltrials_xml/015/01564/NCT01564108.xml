	<brief_summary>Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) treatments show great promise treatment variety retinal disease . This study address condition affect large number patient investigator face difficult management decision . These patient uveitis severely disabled visual loss relate cystoid macular oedema ( CMO ) option remain standard treatment either fail contraindicate . The concentration VEGF increase eye patient uveitis . Our hypothesis series injection Ranibizumab may effective treatment CMO . It hop anti-VEGF therapy few side-effects exist therapy effective improve quality life reduce macular thicken restore visual function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The LIMO Study , Lucentis Treatment Uveitic Patients With Refractory Cystoid Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design open label , prospective non-randomised interventional case series . Clinical staff ask briefly discus option enrol study potentially suitable patient . If patient express interest finding study , doctor contact member study team , provide patient patient information leaflet . This outline detail purpose study , intend benefit intravitreal treatment potential hazard ( include unlicensed use Ranibizumab indication ) . The intravitreal injection procedure discuss . The follow-up schedule outline . There opportunity patient ask question least 24 hour patient think enter study . Only 1 eye patient , bad eye , enrol . Comprehensive pre- post- therapy longitudinal series structure function test perform 20 enrolled patient . All patient receive intravitreal injection perform designated clean room . The injection ( Ranibizumab 0.5 mg 0.05 ml ) administer 4-5 weekly , three injection accord clinical need total 12 month follow-up . A maximum 5 intravitreal Ranibizumab injection administer patient demonstrate positive clinical response . The patient see baseline screen 2 day period , first treatment Ranibizumab administer second day ( maximum 10 work day first baseline screen day ) . Subsequent first 3 injection , investigator ass whether re-treatment warrant ( clinical / OCT criterion set re-treatment protocol ) . Re-treatment , indicate , perform day follow-up visit sooner 4 week later 5 week time last treatment . If re-treatment IVI Ranibizumab defer patient give sham injection . Should relapse ocular inflammation occur , might difficult differentiate whether drug underlie disease . A mild flare , Lucentis-related , may observe treated topical therapy ( patient remain study ) . A moderate severe recurrence , regardless cause necessitate extensive therapy , namely change addition systemic therapy , result patient exit study-this would end point .</detailed_description>
