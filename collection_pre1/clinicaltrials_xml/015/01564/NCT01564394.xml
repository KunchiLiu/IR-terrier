Weekly measure fatigue quality life physical activity log also administer . Biometric assessment , include balance mobility , flexibility , blood pressure , rest heart rate , body mass index , waist-hip-ratio , do baseline ( randomization ) one week post-intervention . Significant others undergo survey measure prostate cancer survivor , except measure specific prostate cancer ( e.g. , EPIC-26-short form ) . Participants recruit two cohort , one begin early March early June , 2012 . The twice-weekly exercise class 60 minute duration , run 12 week .
