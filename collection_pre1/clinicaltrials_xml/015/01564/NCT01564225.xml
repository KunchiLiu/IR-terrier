	<brief_summary>Following discussion FDA , Phase 1 safety study initiate X-Linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia ( XLHED ) -affected adult develop safety exposure data EDI200 anticipation dose XLHED-affected neonate . Selecting XLHED-affected adult study provide genetic match biologic relevance XLHED-affected neonate . Both male female enrol , provide safety experience EDI200 inform plan neonate study well supportive data potential future trial antenatal EDI200 administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 , Open-label , Multicenter , Safety Pharmacokinetic Study EDI200</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 study enroll two cohort 3 XLHED-affected adult , total 6 subject . The size scope study design consistent drug development program ultra-rare disease support absence safety concern GLP non-human primate toxicology study . All subject must meet entry criterion include documentation EDA mutation . Mirroring condition use anticipate XLHED-affected newborn study , adult cohort study incorporate multiple-dose regimen associate maximal efficacy newborn canine model . Primary outcome measure safety , tolerability , immunogenicity pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . While current data support likelihood clinical benefit XLHED-affected adult subject , assay pharmacodynamic/biologic activity incorporate study design exploratory objective .</detailed_description>
