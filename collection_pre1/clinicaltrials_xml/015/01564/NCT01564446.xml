	<brief_summary>Background Significance : Adverse drug event ( ADE ) common healthcare associate adverse event . Transitions inpatient ambulatory care lead ADE avoidable healthcare utilization affect 20 % patient . Insufficient monitoring identify particularly common cause preventable ameliorable ADE . The Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) call process `` accurately completely reconcile medication across continuum care . '' Inpatient computerize medication reconciliation tool show great potential , little know successful medication reconciliation strategy immediately post-discharge . One promising solution outpatient medication reconciliation use secure electronic communication ( SEC ) patient , access personal health record via web portal , provider within electronic health record . Surveys consistently find patient want communicate primary care provider via SEC , SEC rapidly become standard feature electronic health record . A SEC-based approach outpatient medication reconciliation follow hospital discharge potential improve patient safety , important question must address , include : What information need include SEC ? What elements SEC essential design ? How SEC best incorporate workflow primary care office practice ? Will patient physician find approach acceptable ? To address question , propose one-year pilot study VA Boston follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To evaluate primary care environment 's receptivity secure electronic communication ( SEC ) medication reconciliation design prototype SEC . We use qualitative method characterize primary care clinic environment - physical space facility , workflow , resource , well knowledge , attitude skills staff , importantly , patient . Specific approach include in-depth interview , direct ethnographic observation , visualization method Aim 2 . To develop prototype SEC medication reconciliation participatory design process , involve primary care clinician , staff patient work collaboratively research team , test usability acceptability prototype SEC among sample patient primary care clinician . Research Development Plan : With extensive experience design evaluate health care informatics innovation , assemble multi-disciplinary team expertise primary care internal medicine , clinical informatics , health service research , qualitative research , clinical pharmacy , nurse industrial engineering . This team carry formative evaluation develop prototype secure electronic message facilitate medication reconciliation follow hospital discharge . The proposed CIMIT project leverage resource expertise e-Health QUERI ( national VA program innovation evaluation VA 's e-Health program ) VA Boston participate VA facility nationwide . The figure show rough conceptualization SEC guide qualitative research participatory design prototype . This project lay foundation future rigorous evaluation approach medication reconciliation improve patient safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adverse drug event ( ADE ) common healthcare-associated adverse events1 commonly occur hospitalization multiple change medication regimen take place context poor patient education , inadequate information transfer delay continuity care . Medication reconciliation - i.e. , intentional process resolve discrepancy medication patient take medication health care team think patient take - designate `` National Patient Safety Goal '' since 2005.2-6 Recent study examine inpatient computerized medication reconciliation tool pharmacist-facilitated medication reconciliation program hospital discharge show promising result . However , little know successful medication reconciliation strategy follow discharge , represent untapped point leverage improve medication safety . With recently award seed funding , collaboration Department Veterans ' Affairs ( VA ) nationwide Medication Reconciliation Initiative , develop informatics-based tool medication reconciliation follow hospital discharge secure , e-mail-like communication : Secure Messaging Medication Reconciliation Tool ( SMMRT ) . In proposed study , plan pilot SMMRT prototype My HealtheVet ( MHV ) , VA 's secure personal health record web portal , among 50 Veterans VA Boston , follow two Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : Refine exist SMMRT prototype integrate MHV 's secure message web-interface , authentication secure two-way communication patient primary healthcare team . We use participatory patient-centered process involve primary care clinician , pharmacist , nurse , staff member Veterans work collaboratively research team establish usability acceptability prototype SMMRT . Specific Aim 2 : Pilot SMMRT prototype , refine Specific Aim 1 , among 50 Veterans primary care relationship hospitalize facility . Veterans recruit prior hospital discharge , enrol MHV necessary , trained use secure message specifically SMMRT tool . This study benefit recently fund preliminary study ( Veterans ' Engineering Resource Center seed funding , $ 25,000 ) , enable u analyze primary care environment 's receptivity SMMRT-based post-discharge medication reconciliation , focus staff activation education , workflow optimization incorporate staff clinician manage SMMRT 's incoming outgoing message , coordination MHV staff ensure continue successful software integration . This propose CIMIT-funded study lead refine strengthen intervention enhance preliminary use SMMRT , well qualitative result constitute foundation investigator-initiated research proposal alongside full-scale implementation SMMRT MHV Veterans nationwide .</detailed_description>
