	<brief_summary>This study design compare infection rate wound irrigated sterile normal saline irrigate chlorinated tap water . The hypothesis wound infection rate subsequent irrigation tap water significantly different infection rate wound irrigate sterile normal saline . Inclusion criteria patient old 1-year age present emergency department soft-tissue laceration require repair . Exclusion criterion include patient underlie immunocompromising illness , current use antibiotic , puncture bite wound , underlie tendon bone involvement , wound nine hour old . Patients randomized wound irrigate either tap water sterile normal saline prior closure , control volume irrigation method use . Structured follow-up complete 48 hour 30 day determine presence infection . The primary outcome measure difference wound infection rate two randomized group .</brief_summary>
