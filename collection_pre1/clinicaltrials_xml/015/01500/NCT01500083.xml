	<brief_summary>The purpose current study evaluate additional safety data bendamustine 100 patient Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( iNHL ) relapse rituximab regimen Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Patients receive 6 8 cycle bendamustine treatment use dose regimen TREANDAÂ® ( bendamustine ) approve several country , show reasonably well tolerate . The study protocol include safety monitoring ( i.e. , adverse event , concomitant medication , supportive care , clinical safety laboratory test , clinical disease status monitoring ) . It interventional , multicentre , prospective , open-label expand access study , addition allow investigator Canada , patient , access bendamustine pending Canadian marketing approval . Although treatment option available patient iNHL CLL induce substantial response , curative treatment . One potential drug candidate treatment CLL iNHL bendamustine . Bendamustine widely use Germany 30 year market United States treatment CLL treatment iNHL progress within 6 month treatment rituximab rituximab-containing regimen . In October 2010 , European Medicines Agency formally approve bendamustine number Member States European Union treatment patient iNHL , CLL , multiple myeloma . The drug 's safety profile patient population extensively characterize unexpected safety concern anticipate .</brief_summary>
