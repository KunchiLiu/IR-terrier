	<brief_summary>The study design investigate effect investigational drug vibegron ( MK-4618 ) compare placebo maximum urinary bladder capacity woman overactive bladder . The study also evaluate safety tolerability multiple oral dos vibegron woman overactive bladder . Overactive bladder best described urgency frequency urination , without involuntary urination and/or need awaken night urinate . The primary efficacy hypothesis vibegron superior placebo respect change baseline maximum cystometric capacity 2 hour postdose Day 7 ( i.e. , steady state ) participant overactive bladder . A true mean increase ( vibegron/placebo ) 25 % bladder volume expect . The primary safety hypothesis administration multiple oral dos vibegron sufficiently well-tolerated participant overactive bladder , base assessment clinical laboratory adverse experience , permit continued clinical investigation .</brief_summary>
