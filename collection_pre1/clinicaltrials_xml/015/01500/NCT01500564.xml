	<brief_summary>Previous research utilise single session transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) demonstrate functional improvement . However improvement usually short-lived , last less one hour patient 's performance return baseline . In study , tDCS typically applied goal adaptively enhance functional activation pathologically under-active tissue suppress pathologically over-active tissue . Interestingly , small body evidence emerge indicate tDCS improve learning/memory function healthy control . The goal study test application tDCS could enhance learn and/or memory physiotherapy rehabilitation , may turn lead correspondingly great motor improvement . Patients subacute stage ( 1 6 month post stroke ) attend 10 consecutive daily session tDCS . This research important implication ; previous study suggest approach potential facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke establish tDCS clinically viable rehabilitative tool . Recovery motor skill may take many month acquire therefore strategy potential enhance acquisition skill practical scientific interest .</brief_summary>
