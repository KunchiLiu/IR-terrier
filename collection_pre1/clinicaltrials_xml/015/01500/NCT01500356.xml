This study involve recruitment 390 overweight obese adult randomly assign one condition ( Diet Only , MOD-PA , HIGH-PA ) period 12 month . The primary outcome LVM measure cardiac MRI . Secondary outcome include additional cardiac MRI measure ( aortic pulse wave velocity , end diastolic volume , aortic distensibility ) , inflammatory marker ( CRP TNFα ) select adipocytokines ( adiponectin ) biomarkers risk relate vascular outcome , body weight , body composition , cardiorespiratory fitness , traditional CVD risk factor ( lipid , glucose , insulin , blood pressure ) .

	<detailed_description>Current estimate indicate excess 65 percent adult United States overweight ( BMI &gt; 25.0 kg/m2 ) least 30 percent adult classify obese ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) . Overweight obesity link numerous chronic condition include cardiovascular disease . The application cardiac MRI ( CMRI ) allow direct measurement cardiac structure , leave ventricular mass ( LVM ) assess CMRI show predictive cardiovascular disease . Recent study show LVM decrease weight loss ; however , lack information add benefit physical activity weight loss direct measure cardiovascular structure function . Thus , consistent PA-09-243 , study examine effect two recommend dos physical activity combine dietary intervention change propose outcomes cardiovascular disease risk overweight adult . The primary aim study examine effect consensus public health recommend level physical activity [ moderate physical activity ( MOD-PA ) = 150 min/wk ] versus high dose physical activity [ high physical activity ( HIGH-PA ) = 250 min/wk ] context comprehensive behavioral weight loss program include reduction energy intake measure cardiovascular function use cardiac MRI biomarkers vascular disease risk .
