	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , parallel-group , double-blind , active-controlled study rolapitant subject receive HEC ( ≥60 mg/m2 cisplatin-based chemotherapy ) . Study drug administer 1 - 2 hour prior initiation chemotherapy Day 1 . Granisetron dexamethasone administer approximately 30 minute initiation chemotherapy Day 1 , except patient receive taxanes part cisplatin-based chemotherapy . Subjects record event emesis use rescue medication establish nausea and/or vomit indicate severity nausea experience previous 24 hour NV Subject Diary prior HEC administration Day 6 Cycle 1 . Dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily ( part study regimen ) Days 2 4 NOT consider rescue therapy . Health-related quality life measure FLIE Questionnaire Day 6 Cycle 1 . Safety tolerability assess clinical review AEs , physical examination include complete neurological assessment , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , safety laboratory value include BUN andcreatinine . All subject expect complete Cycle 1 option participate five additional cycle . The study investigate efficacy rolapitant treatment CINV initial chemotherapy cycle ( Cycle 1 ) . Safety analyse include data Cycle 1 subsequent cycle . At Screening Visit , blood sample may collect store study maybe analyzed future biomarker research relate safety efficacy . Analysis sample may include DNA , RNA , protein marker . The biomarker blood sample store 2 year post study completion . In addition , PK sample collect subject enrol select site .</detailed_description>
