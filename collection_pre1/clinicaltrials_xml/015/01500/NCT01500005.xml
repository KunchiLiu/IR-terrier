	<detailed_description>Background : The incidence type 2 Diabetes Mellitus increase alarm rate worldwide , 1 million new case per year diagnose United States alone . [ 1 ] Diabetes fifth lead cause death United States , also major cause significant morbidity . Cardiovascular disease lead cause death patient type 2 diabetes . The risk Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality type 2 diabetic patient double compare age-matched subject . [ 2 ] Therefore , reduce cardiovascular risk diabetic patient great importance . Vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) , powerful form vitamin D , synthesize skin 7-dehydrocholesterol action sunlight ( ultraviolet B radiation ) . Vitamin D3 biologically inert . In hepatic parenchyma , vitamin D3 convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 25OHD3 ) must convert active hormone 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D ( calcitriol ) . 25OHD plentiful stable metabolite vitamin D. As , 25OHD level serum best indicator vitamin D level . [ 3 ] The major well know function Vitamin D maintain calcium phosphorus homeostasis promote bone mineralization . It well understood vitamin D deficiency lead osteomalacia osteoporosis adult . [ 4 ] However , recently , increase amount evidence suggest vitamin D may also influence various nonskeletal medical condition , include cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes , cancer , autoimmune disorder [ 4 , 5 ] An evolve data indicates vitamin D deficiency much prevalent previously recognize . In United States , well part world , mean population serum 25OHD level decrease last decade . The best example drop come National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) population show near double number subject American population 1994 2004 25OHD level less 30 ng/ml . [ 6 ] The possible explanation dramatic decrease vitamin D level : downward milk consumption , upward sun protection upward obesity . [ 7 ] All cause cardiovascular mortality : The NHANES III database clearly show increase adjust cause mortality serum 25OHD level fall less 30 ng/ml , especially woman , peak protection death 25OHD level 35-40 ng/ml range . The prevalence coronary artery disease , heart failure , peripheral artery disease significantly increase stepwise fashion serum 25OHD level drop le 30 20 ng/ml ( insufficiency deficiency , respectively ) . [ 8 ] A recent meta-analysis 18 trial comprise 57,311 randomly assigned participant , find vitamin D supplementation &gt; 500 IU/day reduce cause mortality 7 % , part decrease CV death . [ 9 ] Deficient insufficient serum 25 ( OH ) D level document patient myocardial infarction . [ 10 ] A correlation vitamin D deficiency subsequent major adverse CV event find among 1739 Framingham Offspring Study participant free CV disease baseline . In prospective observational study , 25 ( OH ) D level measure baseline subject follow mean 5.4 year . The rate composite CV end point ( fatal nonfatal MI , ischemia , stroke , heart failure ) 53 % 80 % high people low vitamin D level . [ 11 ] The reason association cause mortality , CVD vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency unclear . It also unclear whether vitamin D supplementation normalize CVD risk patient . In recent systemic review Wang et al find complete trial test effect vitamin D calcium supplementation CVD primary end point . [ 12 ] Vitamin D diabetes Inspection recent vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency epidemiological literature bring light strike inverse correlation the25OHDlevel cardiovascular disease also essentially elements human metabolic syndrome : hypertension ; obesity ; insulin resistance glucose Intolerance [ 3 ] Likewise , cross sectional study , inverse association serum 25 ( OH ) D presence type 2 diabetes report variety cohort . [ 13-15 ] One example analysis data participant attend morning examination Third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( 1988-1994 ) show inverse association vitamin D status diabetes . [ 13 ] This observation regard high prevalence vitamin D deficiency among type 2 DM patient establish causative relationship two . In woman 's Health Study , intake 511 IU/d vitamin D associate low risk incidence type 2 DM compare low intake [ 16 ] Vitamin D Arterial stiffness Augmentation pressure , reflect pulsatile component blood pressure thus arterial stiffness , well-known risk factor cardiovascular disease outcome . [ 17-21 ] Augmentation index ( AIx ) , non invasive measure arterial stiffness , show predict coronary artery disease ( CAD ) general population patient type 2 diabetes [ 20 , 22 , 23 ] The differential effect arterial stiffness may responsible different impact diverse antihypertensive drug/treatments CAD . [ 21 ] Different drug prove improve arterial stiffness . One example beneficial effect statins AIx , result independent cholesterol lower effect . [ 24 ] Andrade et al find Lower 1,25-OH2D3 level associate high Aix 131 outpatient identify individual cardiac kidney disease clinic . [ 25 ] Vitamin D regulate renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) experimental animal . Recently data human suggest low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level may result upregulation RAS otherwise healthy human . [ 26 ] No study date examine effect vitamin D supplementation blood pressure arterial stiffness primary end point . The purpose trial investigate effect vitamin D supplementation 24 hour blood pressure monitoring , arterial stiffness , oxidative stress inflammation vitamin D deficient diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
