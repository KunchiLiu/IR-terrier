	<brief_summary>Background : Periurethral Pro-ACT balloon retrourethral AdvanceXP ( TM ) male sling present efficient treatment management stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) follow radical prostatectomy ( RP ) , comparative study two technique publish . The investigator aim compare efficacy two device provide data cost effectiveness . Hypothesis : The study base superiority hypothesis AdvanceXP male sling efficacious Pro-ACT balloon one year follow-up . Primary objective : The primary objective study compare efficacy AdvanceXP retrourethral male sling periurethral Pro-ACT balloon management SUI RP one year follow-up . Secondary objective : - Comprehensive comparative medical evaluation two device term efficacy - Complete evaluation side effect two technique - Evaluation quality life - Evaluation patient satisfaction - Cost-effectiveness study device ( total cost one year two technique , differential cost-effectiveness ratio ( cost adjust QALY ) , differential cost-effectiveness ratio term adjust success rate , recommendation make assess potential coverage French healthcare system ) Population : Patients history RP without cancer recurrence , present pure SUI urodynamics ( without detrusor overactivity ) , mild moderate degree ( 24hour pad-test &lt; 300g ) .

	<brief_title>Periurethral Pro-ACTTM Balloons v Retrourethral AdvanceXP ( TM ) Male Sling Post-prostatectomy Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) common adverse event radical prostatectomy ( RP ) localize prostate cancer dramatically impact quality life . Management SUI RP base conservative measure pelvic floor muscle training . In case failure first line therapy , surgical treatment require . In recent year , periurethral Pro-ACT balloon retrourethral AdvanceXP male sling proven efficient manage SUI RP case mild moderate symptom . Pro-ACT balloon place general anesthesia via perineal approach , laterally membranous urethra bladder neck . This device result external compression urethra . Further adjustment compression possible local anesthesia since balloon link subcutaneous titanium port . AdvanceXP male sling place general anesthesia via perineal approach , transobturator route , result suspension membranous urethra relocate bladder neck . If multiple report claim efficacy two device , never compare prospective comparative trial . Our aim compare efficacy two device provide data cost effectiveness . Hypothesis : The study base superiority hypothesis Advance male sling efficacious Pro-ACT balloon one year follow-up . Objectives : The primary objective study compare efficacy Advance retrourethral male sling periurethral Pro-ACT balloon post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) management . The secondary objective work : - Comprehensive medical evaluation two emerge device term efficiency use usual criterion field urinary incontinence - Complete evaluation side effect two technique - Evaluation quality life - Cost-effectiveness study device ( Total cost one year two technique , differential cost-effectiveness ratio ( cost adjust QALY ) , differential cost-effectiveness ratio term adjust success rate , recommendation make assess potential coverage French healthcare system Population : The study concern patient present SUI follow radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . Patients must older 18 , without cancer recurrence , must present pure SUI urodynamics ( without detrusor overactivity ) , mild moderate incontinence ( 24hour pad-test &lt; 300g ) . Every patient show urethral stricture preoperative cystoscopy exclude study . Study design : This prospective , randomize , multicentric ( 9 tertiary reference center ) , comparative trial two device ( superiority hypothesis ) . The study begin 12 month inclusion period . The total number subject require 240 . At end inclusion process , randomization two arm carry . Follow-up consist 4 visit 1 , 3 , 6 12 month , data collection ( pad use , uroflowmetry , quality life validate questionnaire ICIQ-SF EQ-5D , 24-hr pad test , patient satisfaction PGI-I report secondary effect ) . Statistical evaluation carry end follow-up , intent treat . Medical evaluation : The main criterion study failure treatment , define reduction le 50 % incontinence 24-hr pad test , explantation device implantation new surgical device SUI management year operation . Secondary criterion focus efficacy tolerance evaluate follow-up 1 , 3 , 6 12 month follow criterion : - pad usage per day - quantitative reduction 24hr-pad test - complication ( infection , erosion , hematoma , acute urinary retention ) - number re-interventions re-admissions follow-up - quality life measure ICIQ-SF questionnaire - patient satisfaction PGI-I questionnaire The statistical evaluation main criterion carry chi-square test . Variables know predictive value efficiency ( radiation therapy , severity incontinence ) study logistic regression multivariate analysis . The result adjust center ( multicentric study ) . The quantitative variable compare Mann-Whitney test . Economic evaluation : The economic evaluation carry accord follow manner : - A study total cost one year device , base data collect clinical trial include event require medical care ( visit , complication , reinterventions , readmission ) , also cost pad ( support healthcare system , support patient ) . - From study lead cost collection quality life data , cost device adjust quality life ( QALY evaluation ) - A cost effectiveness study also lead , adjust cost success rate technique - Proposals make state level two device cover healthcare system .</detailed_description>
