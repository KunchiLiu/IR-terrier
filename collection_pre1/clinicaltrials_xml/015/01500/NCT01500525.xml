	<brief_summary>Objectives : Our goal try identify ideal BDR cutoff point Chinese controller-naïve asthmatic child . In order achieve , several step need take . 1 . To observe BDR distribution curve Chinese non-asthmatic child 4-12 year 2 . To observe BDR distribution curve Chinese controller-naïve asthmatic child 4-12 year 3 . To compare BDR value non-asthmatic group controller-naïve asthmatic group , analyze appropriate cut-off point value Hypothesis : 1 . Publications clinical experience indicate BDR value affect ethnicity , child less respond bronchodilator compare adult patient . From aspect , data Chinese child may different data include guideline mostly determined study adults 2 . Reversible bronchospasm characteristic asthma patient . Between asthmatic non-asthmatics , different response BDR test would observe , would cutoff point good sensitivity specificity differentiate asthmatic non-asthmatics Background rationale : According guideline global initiative asthma , global strategy asthma management prevention ( GINA ) guideline United States National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guideline spirometry , include baseline force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) bronchodilator response ( BDR ) short act beta agonist ( SABA ) , use child objective measure establish diagnosis severity bronchial asthma . Spirometry necessary every child come clinic typical symptom objective measurement improve diagnosis confidence . Baseline FEV1 , call `` gold standard '' evaluate airway obstruction adult , usually normal range ( great 80 % predict ) child , regardless asthma severity . This substantially limit value diagnosis assessment response treatment . Because , several objective measure suggest diagnosis treatment child , include response bronchodilator , reflect airway reversibility , also marker airway inflammation . The current definition positive BDR &gt; 12 % reversibility &gt; 200 ml increase initial FEV1 short act beta-agonist ( SABA ) use . However , recent report clinical observation reveal , significant part Chinese asthmatic child , BDR value achieve 12 % evaluation . It suggest cutoff point 12 % conservative pediatric patient . In study carry Galant et al among 51 non-asthmatic child 346 controller naïve asthmatic child 4-17 year , BDR value could achieve 12 % 30.6 % asthmatic child , across severity . Meanwhile , observe BDR value study , result 2.2 % ( 95 % CI , 0.2-4.3 ) non-asthmatic group compare 8.6 % ( 95 % CI , 7.5-9.8 ) asthmatic group . The range see 7.6 % ( 95 % CI , 5.8-9.5 ) mild asthma 10.1 % ( 95 % CI , 7.6-12.6 ) severe persistent group . Also , study among 142 child 5-10 year UK , 9 % increase FEV1 bronchodilator use suggest cutoff point good sensitivity specificity . Moreover , study carry among 3052 child rural area 8-15 year Anhui Province China , result show BDR 3 +/- 5 % non-asthmatic child , 7 +/- 9 % asthmatic child . Difference propose study carry hospital one Anhui Province subject propose study 4-12 year old , large patient segment clinic include preschool school student . And importantly , main purpose study Anhui observe BDR range non-asthmatic child asthmatic child , study , besides objective , tentatively calculate BDR cutoff point use receiver operate characteristic ( ROC curve ) . And cutoff point use reference indicator asthma diagnosis long-term management . The current BDR cutoff point 12 % ideal child also reflect clinical management . It show persistent BDR value , even less 12 % , asthmatic child suggest poor clinical outcome . In 4 year study among 1041 asthmatic child America carry Sharma et al , show compare individual BDR 12 % 200ml , individual BDR 10 % similar poor clinical outcome ( e.g . hospital visit , prednisone burst , increase nocturnal awakening , miss day school ) . Same result also obtain Galant et al study among 679 asthmatic child among 5-18 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchodilator Response 4-12 Years Chinese Controller Naive Asthmatic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational non-interventional clinical study . 1 . Patient population : Three hundred non-asthmatic 300 asthmatic child recruit . 1 . Non-asthmatic group : healthy child 4-12 year recruit Capital Institute Pediatrics nearby school Inclusion criterion : 1 . Willingly attend investigation 2 . Chest physical test normal Exclusion criterion : 1 . The child hospitalize severe respiratory condition 2 . A physician ever state child asthma , reactive airway disease , child take antiasthma medication symptoms 3 . The child diagnose congenital heart disease require surgery medication management 4 . There positive response concern serious chest problem , chest surgery , chronic productive cough , recurrent intractable wheezing , shortness breath 5 . The child finish test meet American Thoracic Society criterion preschool child maximum 6 attempt unable successfully complete post-bronchodilator ( BD ) spirometry 2 . Asthmatic group : 4-12 year old asthmatic child recruit asthma clinic Capital Institute Pediatrics Inclusion criterion : 1 . Diagnose asthma specialist asthma ( base symptom ) : criterion diagnosis asthma make asthma specialist include history recurrent coughing , wheeze , shortness breath rest exercise , symptomatic improvement bronchodilator use , exclusion diagnose 2 . Asymptomatic mild symptomatic physical sign wheeze time test 3 . Not receive controller medication 6 week prior initial evaluation 4 . Willing attend investigation Exclusion criterion : 1 ) Using short β2 agonist within 6 hour 2 ) Using long act β2 agonist within 24 hour 3 ) Can finish test meet American Thoracic Society criterion preschool child maximum 6 attempt unable successfully complete post-bronchodilator spirometry . 2 . Preparation test 1 ) Sign consent form . 2 ) Fill asthma severity form accord NEAPP guideline ( asthmatic group ) . 3 ) Chest physical test , record form test . 4 ) Standing height weight measure . 5 ) Calculation age : The date test subtracts date birth . 3 . Pulmonary function test Standardized pulmonary function test conduct . Contents test : Pre post flow volume : forced volume vital capacity ( FVC ) , FEV0.5 , FEV1 , FEV1/FVC ratio , PEF , force expiratory flow 25 ( FEF25 ) , FEF50 , FEF75 , FEF25-75 , force expiratory time ( FET ) , back-extrapolated volume ( VBE ) , VBE/FVC . The BDR base pulmonary function measurement administration 2.5 mg albuterol nebulizer . BDR calculate [ ( postbronchodilator FEV1- baseline FEV1 ) /baseline FEV1 ] x 100 % . Study Procedures : 1 . Spirometry preparation The spirometry purchase VIASYS Healthcare , Hochberg Germany ( MasterScope ) . 1 . Check : Before switch , check conjunction flow sensor hand knob , ensure black compact tightness . 2 . Calibration : Before calibration , room temperature , pressure , humidity test recorded parameter reconcile BTPS condition . Using 2 liter scalar calibrate flow . Every day even flow calibration . Every week flow linear calibration , include high , medium low flow three different flow calibration . The variety le 3 % . The record calibration print , technician sign save . 2 . Test method The training process Eigen H. et al ( ref 8 ) . The entire instruction test session child strictly limit 15 min , time child instruct technique spirometry perform least three forced vital capacity maneuver . A highly experienced child 's pulmonary function technologist instruction child . At time test , child give explanation test procedure individually test use coach technique use pulmonary function laboratory evaluate young child . 3 . Criteria accept Data ( ATS/ERS 2005 ) The principle spirometry quality control preschool child adult . 1 . It necessary visually inspect flow-volume volume-time trace , exclude maneuver visibly inadequate . Maneuvers exclude flow-volume curve demonstrate rapid rise peak flow , smooth descend limb , evidence cough glottis closure . 2 . The start test quantify calculate VBE . Some investigator report 80 % studied preschool population achieve VBE le equal 80 ml less 12.5 % FVC . Alternative criterion present , view guide assist visual inspection , rather exclusion criterion . 3 . The end test quantify report point cessation flow . It know many preschool child sustain forced expiration 1 second , let alone 6 second previously stipulate adult ( ref 9 ) , force expired time report used exclude maneuver . This pattern misinterpret early termination ( ref 10 ) .</detailed_description>
