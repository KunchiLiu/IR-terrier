	<brief_title>American Ginseng Improve HIV-Associated Fatigue : A Randomized , Placebo-Controlled , Parallel Design , Multiple-Dose Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Chronic fatigue major problem HIV-infected patient contributes decrease quality life physical functioning , high level psychological distress , antiretroviral non-adherence . The etiology fatigue HIV-infected patient unknown , change systemic inflammation may play contribute role . The mechanism action ginseng treatment fatigue also clear , role purport `` adaptogen , '' may decrease fatigue alter systemic inflammation . Ginseng one popular botanical product US market improve fatigue vitality . Our preliminary data suggest American ginseng 1000-2000 mg/day may decrease fatigue cancer patient . HIV-infected patient frequently use ginseng , part perceive therapy safer conventional therapy . We hypothesize standardized American ginseng formulation improve HIV-related fatigue . To test hypothesis propose 6-week double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , parallel study four week treatment involve two dos American ginseng placebo ( 1000mg/day 3000 mg/day ) 120 HIV-infected patient clinically significant fatigue , define score Fatigue Severity Scale . Patients treated American ginseng placebo every morning total two dos 1000 mg/day 3000 mg/day . A small cohort 12 120 subject enrol initially monitor closely confirm virologic failure , If confirm virologic failure observe , enrollment continue propose 120 subject . Virologic failure define two consecutive plasma viral load &gt; 200 cell accord 2012 Department Health Humans Services Guidelines use antiretroviral agent HIV-1 infect adult adolescents The propose dos American ginseng use previous trial . American ginseng 1000 mg/day show efficacy ameliorate fatigue cancer patient . The high dose American ginseng ( 3000 mg/day ) select study derive previous American ginseng trial . Change score Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) American ginseng placebo group baseline , treatment week 2 , 4 , 6 ( last safety visit two week complete 4-week treatment period American ginseng placebo ) calculate . The primary comparison interest involve primary endpoint average change FSS scale score baseline end treatment . Other instrument supplement FSS ass fatigue modify version Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) , The Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) , Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey ( MOS-HIV ) , Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Change Scale , PROMIS fatigue . To elucidate mechanism HIV-related fatigue , evaluate effect American ginseng placebo marker systemic inflammation IL-6 soluble receptor TNF α 1 2 ( sTNFR1 sTNFR2 ) , baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 . CD4 cell count , plasma HIV RNA level , adverse event ( AEs ) also assess safety purpose . DURATION : The total duration study 6 week . Participants receive American ginseng placebo first 4 week study . On week 6 participant complete final post treatment safety study visit . POPULATION AND SAMPLE SIZE : 120 HIV-infected subject ( 40 American ginseng 1000 mg/day arm , 40 American ginseng 3000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo 1000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo 3000 mg/day arm ) . REGIMEN : This randomize , placebo-controlled , longitudinal , parallel study two dos American ginseng . As show study schematic figure , two dos American ginseng placebo ( 1000 3000 mg/day ) give 120 HIV-infected patient ( 40 American ginseng 1000 mg/day arm , 40 American ginseng 3000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo 1000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo 3000 mg/day arm ) clinically significant fatigue . Participants receive American ginseng placebo total 4 week follow total 6 week ( week 6 last safety visit 2 week complete 4-week treatment period American ginseng placebo ) . American ginseng continue Grades 1 2 toxicity discretion investigator . Treatment discontinued subject experience grade ≥3 study drug toxicity . Evaluations early termination visit complete subject . Participants discontinue treatment secondary toxicity follow resolution , return baseline value , adequate explanation give condition . Subjects require dose modifications/reductions/interruptions American ginseng/placebo manage toxicity follow study drug . The total number patient accrue hence 120 patient ( 40 American ginseng 1000 mg/day arm , 40 American ginseng 3000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo 1000 mg/day arm , 20 placebo American ginseng 3000 mg/day arm ) . STUDY DURATION The total duration study six week . Participants receive American ginseng placebo first 4 week study . On week 6 participant complete final post treatment safety study visit . STUDY AGENT/INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION Two dos American ginseng placebo ( 1000 mg/day 3000 mg/day ) every morning mouth 4-week period . PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OBJECTIVES The overall objective study determine effect American ginseng fatigue HIV-infected subject . HIV-infected subject fatigue randomize receive two dos ( 1000 mg/day 3000 mg/day ) standardize American ginseng placebo , level fatigue quality life assess . We also quantify proinflammatory cytokine placebo American ginseng-treated group elucidate mechanism HIV-related fatigue , effect American ginseng marker . ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoint : Change FSS total score baseline end four week treatment . Secondary Endpoints : Change baseline value observe 2 , 4 , 6 week post-baseline following measure : BFI-global assessment score ESS score PHQ-9 total score ISI score MOS-HIV scale total score GIC score PROMIS fatigue scale score Serum cytokine ( IL-6 , sTNFR1 , sTNFR2 ) CD4 cell count , proportion detectable plasma HIV RNA , AEs measure use Division AIDS Table Grading Severity Adults Adverse event .</detailed_description>
