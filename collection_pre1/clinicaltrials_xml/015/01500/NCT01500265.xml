	<brief_summary>Nucleotide analogue associate long term risk proximal tubular nephropathy ( PT ) loss phosphate , , compensatory mechanism overwhelm , osteopenia osteoporosis . This toxicity particularly document tenofovir ( TDF ) HIV disease , prevalence varies widely literature mainly associate comorbidities : average prevalence 0.39 % 48 week exceptional case Fanconi syndrome described . In HBV monoinfection 60 month treatment TDF , 11 % decrease creatinine clearance ( CreatCl ) observe . A single study show significant increase creatinine level entecavir ( ETV ) therapy , second-generation nucleoside , hitherto describe nephrotoxic . Furthermore , direct renal toxic effect characteristic HIV kidney well know , role HBV less clear . Thus , HBV treatment appear renal protective effect . The monitoring tool recommend SPC , CreatCl plasma phosphorus level late marker tubular damage . The threshold phosphate tubular reabsorption ( TmPi/GFR ) fractional excretion uric acid ( FEUA ) unexpensive early screening tool . However , long-term evolution subclinical tubular involvement HBV monoinfection know .</brief_summary>
