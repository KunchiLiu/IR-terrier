	<brief_summary>Background : Despite excellent result total knee replacement , also know total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) persistent controversy whether replace surface kneecap . Anterior knee pain , occur variable unpredictable frequency , continue problem subset TKA patient . Some clinician replace surface kneecap TKA avoid repeat surgery , occur approximately 10 % case . However , others cite complication attribute replace surface kneecap reason avoid procedure . This study prospectively randomize patient receive TKA two group , receive replacement kneecap surface leave without replacement kneecap surface determine clinical outcome revision first 5-10 postoperative year . Objectives : The primary objective work compare pain , stiffness function group five year postoperatively . Secondarily , compare pain , stiffness function one 10 year postoperatively . Finally , examine number reoperations follow TKR 10 year 2 group subject . The investigator hypothesize would difference two group subject measure outcomes . Methods : Patients receive TKA prospectively enrol surgery randomize intraoperatively either receive replacement kneecap surface kneecap intervention . The Smith Nephew Profix TKA system implanted case ; post-operative regimen standardize . Subjects assess pre-operatively 1 5 year postoperatively pain , function , stiffness use disease-specific ( Western Ontario MacMaster Osteoarthritis Index [ WOMAC ] ) generic health status ( Short Form 36 [ SF-36 ] ) questionnaire . At end five year follow-up , study extend 10-year followup outcome assess . The revision rate also compare two group end 10-year follow-up .</brief_summary>
