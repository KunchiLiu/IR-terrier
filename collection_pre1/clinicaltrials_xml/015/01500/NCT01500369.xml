	<brief_title>Effect Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Incidence Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common arrhythmic complication coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) ( 1 ) . It remain challenging prevent , treat , cure ( 2 ) . It contribute increase mortality ( 3 ) , heart failure ( 4 ) , stroke ( 5 ) , increase length hospital stay , intensive care unit readmission , treatment cost ( 6 ) . The pathogenesis atrial fibrillation ( AF ) cardiac surgery consider multifactorial . Some factor include patient 's preoperative status , age , preexist electrocardiogram abnormality ( 7 ) . Intra-operative stress also play key role due occurrence reperfusion , inflammation , oxidative stress , hemostasis ( 8 , 9 ) . Post operatively , almost AF episode occur within first 6 day follow cardiac surgery , peak incidence second third post-operative day coincides peak systemic inflammation cause surgery atrial stretch ( 10 ) . Despite improvement medical therapy , surgical technique , anesthesia AF occur 25-40 % patient undergoing CABG ( 1 , 11 ) . However recent meta-analysis demonstrate pharmacological therapy reduce post-operative AF , reduce length stay , cost hospitalization , potential stroke ( 12 ) . Therefore , great interest establish strategy prevent arrhythmia . Ischemic preconditioning among strategy show myocardial protective effect CABG ( 13 ) . It first describe 1986 dog provide protective effect myocardium later subject sustain bout ischemia ( 14 ) . Subsequently , various clinical setting demonstrate ischemic preconditioning reduces incidence cardiac arrhythmia ( 15 ) . In addition efficacy precondition cardiac surgery percutaneous coronary intervention demonstrate human ( 16 ) . The exact cellular mechanism precondition still controversial . Among mediator NO˙ , ˙OH , ONOO− may play role ischemia/reperfusion injury development cardio-protective effect precondition ( 17 ) ; NO˙ consider attenuate oxidative stress mediate cell injury ischemia/ reperfusion . However , whether NO˙ play protective detrimental role myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury preconditioning remain controversial ( 18 , 19 ) . In recent study , Jannati et al . demonstrate myocardial ischemic preconditioning aortic cross clamp patient undergo CABG reduce incidence post operative AF ( 20 ) . Currently clinical precondition protocol tool utilized CABG . Additionally , aortic cross clamping may increase risk embolic stroke , particularly elderly patient ( 21 ) . Therefore , conduct prospective single-blinded randomize control study demonstrate whether remote ischemic preconditioning reduces incidence post operative AF . IV . RESEARCH DESIGN OBJECTIVE : To investigate remote ischemic preconditioning reduce risk post operative atrial fibrillation patient undergo elective CABG . Study Population This prospective randomized control study patient older 18 year old undergoing elective CABG without valve surgery Baystate Medical Center . Exclusion criterion include preoperative rhythm sinus , history atrial fibrillation , New York Hear Association ( NYHA ) IV congestive heart failure , cardiogenic shock , emergent CABG and/or valve surgery , bleed diathesis , woman child-bearing potential . Eligible patient participate obtain consent . Patients blindly randomize patient two group : Study Groups 1 . Treatment Group : Patients treatment group receive three sequential sphygmomanometer cuff inflation right upper arm induction anesthesia operating room . The cuff inflate OR nurse 200 mmHg five minute occasion , five minute deflation inflation . Following `` pre-conditioning '' phase , routine anesthesia procedure implement . The entire pre-conditioning phase last 30 minute . 2 . Control Group : Patients control group sphygmomanometer cuff place right upper arm , cuff inflate . Similar patient treatment group , patient control group undergo 30 minute delay induction anesthesia surgery . Data Collection After completion surgery , telemetry monitor atrial fibrillation review daily 12-lead electrocardiography obtain need . All episodes atrial fibrillation telemetry collect , review , enter data sheet . The data sheet available chart patient enrol study ( study control group ) . These data transfer kept data set cod study ID number . The identifier include age , sex , medical record number ( MRN ) , date admission , date discharge , length post operative hospital stay . We collect baseline characteristic include age , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , myocardial infarction , leave ventricular ejection fraction , concomitant valvular disease , history heart surgery , medication , type surgery , post-operation atrial fibrillation . Data collection close end one-year present publication presentation , patient identify . Subject Confidentiality To maintain patient confidentiality , collect data password protect computer paper file kept locked cabinet PIs office . All data enter spreadsheet immediately de-identified create study ID number . The master list contain patient ID code password protect computer . Outcome Events The primary outcome atrial fibrillation last five minute longer first seven day surgery . Secondary outcome include length hospital stay , incidence myocardial infraction , stroke , postoperative day arrhythmic event . EKG record Twelve-lead electrocardiogram record preoperatively , follow surgery return intensive care unit , daily first seven day hospital stay . Also arrhythmic event record telemetry hospital stay . Randomization Procedure Once eligibility establish consent obtain , patient randomize accord computer generate randomization procedure . Patients randomize block size 4 6 . Permuted block randomization insure study group remain balanced completion block unbalance study group minimize study terminate block interval . Data analysis Treatment control group compare baseline characteristic identify patient clinical factor may adequately balance randomization procedure . Continuous variable compare use 2-sample t-tests non-parametric equivalent ( Wilcoxon rank-sum test ) , categorical variable compare use Pearson chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Differences baseline characteristic achieve p-value .15 le include subsequent multivariable analysis . Multivariable analysis conduct use logistic regression . The dependent variable dichotomous variable presence absence atrial fibrillation time 7-day follow-up period . Independent variable include dichotomous variable represent study group , well baseline characteristic require adjustment . Data analyze intention-to-treat basis . Sample Size The sample size calculate estimate 35 % incidence atrial fibrillation 7-day period control patient undergoing CABG . To detect absolute reduction 13 percentage point ( i.e. , 35 % control group vs. 22 % treatment group ) 5 % significance 80 % power , study require randomization 205 patient per study group . Early Termination Study To determine whether early termination trial necessary due large expect benefit large expect harm , plan one interim look data 50 % patient complete follow-up . We use Obrien-Fleming ( 1979 ) spending function adjust alpha comparison interim analysis final analysis order maintain overall critical level 5 % ( overall p-value 5 % ) . Thus , trial terminate early interim analysis absolute difference proportion atrial fibrillation study group achieve significance level p ≤ 0.003 . For final analysis study completion , significance test conduct p ≤ 0.047 . This adjustment insure comparison conduct overall significance level 5 % . Budget No expense anticipate . Disclosures Patient confidentiality ensure cod data . No direct patient contact . No active intervention affect patient care health propose . No vulnerable group include study . Patient consent would require inclusion study . None investigator vest interest outcome/s study may affect objectivity data gathering/analysis recommendation make base result study . Risk benefit ratio Minimal risk involve study . However , demonstrate benefit non-invasive remote ischemic preconditioning reduce incident post operative atrial fibrillation add new information literature . More importantly , another preventive option available reduce incidence post operative atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
