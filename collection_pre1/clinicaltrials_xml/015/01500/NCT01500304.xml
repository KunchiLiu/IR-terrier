	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , Phase 1 clinical trial determine safety feasibility minimally invasive inguinal lymph node dissection patient melanoma . Licensed surgeon undergo special training , include course Mayo Clinic Rochester minimally invasive lymph node dissection ( MILND ) perform new procedure home institution . The study characterize learn curve MILND clinical setting , evaluate safety new operative technique . The hypothesis study : 1 ) minimally invasive groin dissection safe procedure . 2 ) structure educational training program feasible effective method train practice surgeon novel procedure 3 ) pre-course generic laparoscopic technical skill correlate minimally invasive superficial groin dissection performance clinical setting , include operative oncologic standard safety metric .</detailed_description>
