	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) type blood lymph node cancer mostly affect elderly . CLL/SLL create abnormal white blood cell hurt immune system make difficult fight infection . These cancer usually diagnose age 50 ; half people CLL/SLL age 70 . Elderly people often respond well standard chemotherapy CLL/SLL . They may health problem make chemotherapy difficult . In addition , individual genetic abnormality call 17p deletion also respond well standard treatment CLL/SLL . Researchers want test new cancer treatment drug , PCI-32765 , see treat CLL/SLL hard-to-treat group . Objectives : - To see PCI-32765 safe effective treatment CLL/SLL old people people 17p deletion . Eligibility : - Individuals 65 year age CLL/SLL . - Individuals least 18 year age CLL/SLL 17p deletion . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , image study . Blood urine sample take . Optional bone marrow lymph node biopsy may also take . - Participants take PCI-32765 capsule every day 28 day ( one cycle treatment ) . Treatment monitor frequent blood test clinic visit . - PCI-32765 give six cycle treatment . Those benefit drug continue take long side effect disease progress . Those benefit stop treatment regular followup exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CLL/SLL malignancy B cell predominantly affect elderly population . Diagnosis typically make adult age 50 half people CLL/SLL age 70 . Elderly patient particular comorbidities limit tolerability standard CLL/SLL chemoimmunotherapy regimen often inferior response particular regimen . In addition , patient 17p deletion also inferior outcome due rapid progression disease well refractoriness standard treatment regimens . It still unclear lead development CLL/SLL . However , recent study indicate B cell receptor ( BCR ) signal important contributor disease could target therapy . Bruton Tyrosine Kinase ( Btk ) enzyme require BCR signal . Ibrutinib potent selective inhibitor Bruton Tyrosine Kinase ( Btk ) . In vitro lymphoma model demonstrate ibrutinib inhibits Btk . Inhibition Btk block downstream BCR signal pathway thus prevents B cell proliferation . A phase 1 study ibrutinib show activity multiple lymphoma include CLL/SLL . This study investigate efficacy ibrutinib patient CLL/SLL patient older 65 need therapy.This protocol intend patient untreated undergone therapy .</detailed_description>
