	<brief_summary>Neck pain related problem occur frequently modern society considerable impact individual society . Cervical radiculopathy ( CR ) generally present pain , numbness , weakness dermatomal distribution . CR result impingement nerve root either spondylotic narrowing neural foramen lateral intervertebral disc herniation . Various study show nonoperative management CR effective , medication , physical therapy , Spinal manipulation , traction , acupuncture , collar immobilization epidural steroid injection . Spinal manipulation one manual technique treat mechanical neck pain . No high-quality evidence prove effectiveness manipulative therapy treatment cervical radiculopathy . However , limited evidence suggest manipulation may provide short-term benefit treatment neck pain , cervicogenic headache radicular symptom . Few complication , worsen radiculopathy , myelopathy , spinal cord injury , may occur . Spinal massage manipulation use century China . Many patient cervical disc disease increasingly turn manipulation alleviate symptom reduce side effect medication . The goal study determine efficacy spinal manipulation , three step nine manipulation , treat cervical radiculopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiculopathy generally present pain , numbness , weakness dermatomal distribution . Causative factor include acute nucleus pulposus herniation , spondylitic change around foramen cause nerve compression , combination . Cervical radiculopathy result impingement nerve root either spondylotic narrowing neural foramen lateral intervertebral disc herniation . Frequent complaint include painful neck movement , radicular pain , paraspinal muscle spasm , muscle weakness , diminish deep tendon reflex ( Radhakrishnan K , 1994 ) . Radiculopathy tend produce substantial limitation movement head neck . The goal treatment plan well define . Specifically , goal treat physician relieve pain , improve function , prevent recurrence . Although symptomatic patient meet surgical criterion , patient clearly candidate nonoperative treatment . Treatment modalities radiculopathy include rest , medication , physical therapy , manipulation , injection , patient education . Various study show nonoperative management cervical radiculopathy leave substantial minority patient persistently troublesome symptom ( Lees F , 1963,41 , 42 ) . Lees Turner find two third patient , symptom tend persist absence surgical treatment ( Lees F , 1963 ) . DePalma Subin find 255 patient treat nonoperatively , 29 % experience complete symptom relief ( Radhakrishnan K , 1994,41 ) . Better outcomes nonoperative management , however , observed study base physiotherapy center surgical series ( Radhakrishnan K , 1994 ) . Spinal balance way Professor Shi Qi `` Arthralgia theory '' `` The theory muscle imbalance `` theory guidance mix martial art , Wang Shi expertise Traumatology , combine clinical experience experimental research . Rub , take , roll , put , loose , pull , friction , shake , pinching , call `` nine manipulation . '' It adjust qi blood , phlegm stasis , Dredge meridian , spasm pain , support organ , alleviate , correct cervical dynamic static imbalance . Three step nine manipulation common method treatment Professor Shi Qi cervical disease .</detailed_description>
