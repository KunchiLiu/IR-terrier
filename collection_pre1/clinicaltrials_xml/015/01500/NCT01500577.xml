	<brief_title>A Prevention Trial Subjects High Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer ( BC ) one four `` big killer '' . The reduction incidence mortality top priority . Early diagnosis screen modified average prognosis , nonetheless significant proportion BCs ultimately elude control . Recently BC prevention greatly improve chemopreventive efficacy various compound , particularly SERMs recently AIs ( aromatase inhibitor ) , repeatedly document . However drug show effective almost exclusively hormone-responsive ( ER positive ) BCs . At least one-third BCs influence hormonal intervention absence ER expression since begin another number cancer subsequently `` escape '' hormonal control become resistant tamoxifen AIs . Unfortunately , ER negativity frequently combine characteristic biological aggressiveness ( high grade proliferation , overexpression HER2/neu ) , result bad prognosis . Furthermore , woman family history breast ovarian cancer high risk develop ER negative BC compare general population . In particular BRCA-1 mutation carrier approximately 90 % ER negative tumour , display characteristic gene expression profile . For reason , method well select subject high risk ER negative BC strategy prevent actively seek . Women BRCA-1 mutation ERnegative DCIS high risk develop ER negative tumor . Very importantly , many subject onset BC occurs often early lifetime one represent clinical , also major social issue . Thus , suitable candidate phase II chemoprevention trial novel agent target important molecular pathway . An important potential molecular target ER negative BC prevention Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 gene ( COX-2 ) overexpression , strongly correlate breast carcinogenesis . Other important target include inhibition proteasome cholesterol pathway . Agents positively interfere pathway , like COX-2 inhibitor statin , may offer new chance prevent form serious breast disease affect large number subject worldwide . Importantly , drug propose trial add extensive background safety promise BC prevention effect . This research relevant follow issue clinical/epidemiological cancer research : 1. acceptability feasibility cancer chemoprevention population increase risk breast cancer ; 2. efficacy administration two target-oriented drug reduce BC development relatively early phase carcinogenesis ; 3. safety low dose drug , special emphasis development gastrointestinal side effect nimesulide , hepatologic side effect simvastatin ; 4. study relationship tissue biomarkers carcinogenesis , presence intraepithelial neoplasia ( include cancer precursor pre-malignant lesion ) , onset breast cancer placebo arm ; 5. study association computer-assisted cytometric , morphometric markovian parameter ( nuclear area , DNA index configurable run length ) development breast cancer surrogate effect intervention nimesulide simvastatin ; 6. study BC association insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , IGF bind protein , hormone circulate biomarkers , development breast cancer surrogate effect study intervention . The propose study lead 3-year time period well understanding issue . Moreover , may benefit well-known advantage phase II study intermediate biomarkers upon large phase III trial : combination lower cost , relatively short time show result , possibility avoid take `` false step '' , concomitant validation establish novel surrogate biomarkers .</detailed_description>
