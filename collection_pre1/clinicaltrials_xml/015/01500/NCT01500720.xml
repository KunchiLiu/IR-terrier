	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To demonstrate progression free survival ( PFS ) improvement cabazitaxel compare topotecan participant sensitive resistant/refractory small cell lung cancer follow first line platinum base chemotherapy . Secondary Objectives : - To assess disease progression free rate 12 week - To assess Response Rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) duration response - To assess Overall Survival ( OS ) - To assess Safety ( National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria [ NCI-CTC ] version 4.03 ) - To assess Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQoL )</brief_summary>
