	<brief_summary>Background : - During puberty , child begin develop adult . Problems hormone release puberty affect reproductive system . Some people low hormone level severely delay prevent puberty . Others start puberty abnormally early . Other people may normal puberty develop reproductive disorder later life . Researchers want study people reproductive disorder learn disorder may inherit . Objectives : - To learn reproductive system disorder may inherit . Eligibility : - People one follow problem : - Abnormally early puberty - Abnormally late puberty - Normal puberty hormonal problem develop later life - People yet puberty symptom indicate low hormone level . Design : - Participants provide blood sample test . They complete questionnaire symptom . They also scratch-and-sniff test study problem ability smell . - Participant medical record review . Participants also provide family medical history . - Family member study may invite participate . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The key initiating factor reproductive development remain among great mystery pediatric reproductive endocrinology . The onset puberty initiate pulsatile secretion gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) hypothalamus . The neuroendocrine event lead increase GnRH secretion resultant onset puberty remain largely unknown . Isolated deficiency GnRH result rare clinical syndrome idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( IHH ) , decrease secretion GnRH result impair gonadotropin secretion . The resultant hypogonadism present delay , incomplete , absent sexual maturation . Human animal model identify number gene responsible IHH , half patient clinical evidence disorder detectable mutation . In addition , significant clinical heterogeneity among affected individual , include member family harbor mutation . Careful human phenotyping patient family expand understanding spectrum disorder include oligo-digenic inheritence , well reversibility condition , provide insight developmental pathway involve ontogeny GnRH neuron . Genetic analysis subject unknown mutation likely yield important insight additional pathway involve regulation GnRH secretion . Here , propose genetic investigation subject IHH characterize phenotypic effect previously describe genetic variant , well identify novel gene involve congenital GnRH deficiency . In collaboration Reproductive Endocrine Unit Massachusetts General Hospital , use candidate gene whole exome approach , well linkage analysis . The collaboration allow sufficient statistical power conduct investigation . This protocol utilize disease model IHH increase understand physiology GnRH secretion , include neuroendocrine regulation GnRH pulsatility . Examining genetic characteristic subject isolate GnRH deficiency reveal insight mechanisms underlie reawaken hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis puberty , provide opportunity new diagnostic capability therapeutic intervention disorder puberty fertility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The essential inclusion criterion include : 1. failure go normal , ageappropriate , spontaneous puberty low sex steroid level set low/normal gonadotropin , 2. abnormally early development puberty , 3. normal puberty subsequent development low gonadotropin level , 4. prepubertal individual feature suggestive hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . 5 . Family member : affect unaffected family member strongly encourage participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism rare condition , protocol remain open enrollment may study subject qualify interested participating . Because HH represent spectrum , associate clinical finding may provide phenotypic clue assessment inheritability underlie physiology , exclusion criterion limit : Patients additional pituitary deficiency , effectively rule isolate GnRH deficiency , whether deficiency congenital acquire ( e.g . secondary malignancy , infection , irradiation ) .</criteria>
