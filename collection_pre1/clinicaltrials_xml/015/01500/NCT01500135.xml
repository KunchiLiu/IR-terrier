	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Safety TachoSil® Versus Surgicel® Original Secondary Hemostatic Treatment Needle Hole Bleeding Vascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TachoSil® . TachoSil® use treat people undergo schedule subacute vascular surgery . This study look well TachoSil® patch stop bleed surgical site compare Surgicel® Original patch . The study enrol 150 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two open label treatment group 2:1 ratio : - TachoSil® - Surgicel® Original This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study approximately 6 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic , include safety follow-up visit 1 , 3 6 month surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Planned elective subacute procedure polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft include least one expect endtoside anastomosis PTFE graft femoral artery ( e.g . femoralfemoral crossover , aorto ( bi ) femoral , axillo ( bi ) femoral , femoropopliteal , femorocrural bypass grafting ) , PTFE patch angioplasty femoral artery , endtoside anastomosis PTFE graft upper extremity artery connection arteriovenous bypass graft dialysis access . The evaluation site plan femoral anastomosis must de novo site . The participant must heparinized surgery . Intraoperatively ( randomization ) The participant need secondary hemostatic treatment Verification evaluation site de novo site Verification surgical procedure perform either endtoside PTFE patch angioplasty . Main Thrombolytic therapy administer within 12 hour surgery ( e.g . recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) Alteplase ) . Liver cirrhosis . Intraoperatively ( randomization ) Severe bleed anastomosis arterial bypass use PTFE graft prosthesis PTFE patch angioplasty No bleeding ( dry surgical field ) target application area Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( DIC ) Application topical hemostatic material include fibrin sealant/glue evaluation site .</criteria>
