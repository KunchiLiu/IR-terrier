	<detailed_description>This randomize , partial double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 1 study design evaluate whether sterile protective immunity P. falciparum induce wild-type ( non-attenuated ) sporozoite immunization exposure limit sporozoite early liver stage parasite life cycle low dose sporozoite inoculum relative whole parasite vaccination model use live attenuate P. falciparum parasite ( e.g . irradiated sporozoite ) . A secondary objective study evaluate newly identify antigens potential target immune response preferentially induced individual protect whole sporozoite vaccination . Once identify immune target , antigen prioritize subunit vaccine development . Subjects closely monitor sign symptom malaria and/or drug toxicity throughout study . A total 36 healthy , malaria-naive adult subject enrol study . Six subject randomize Pilot Phase ( Arm 1 ) , 24 Main ITV Phase ( Arms 2 , 3 , 4 ) , six subject randomize challenge control ( Arm 5 ) start day challenge Challenge Phase . Subjects Arms 1-4 receive three episode ITV immunization subsequent challenge homologous P. falciparum sporozoites absence chemoprophylaxis . The ITV immunization study consist : 1 . Experimental infection wild-type ( non-attenuated ) NF54 strain P. falciparum sporozoite deliver bite 12 - 15 infected A. stephensi mosquito ( ITV infection ) administer conjunction 2 . Causal prophylaxis PQ placebo , time eliminate parasite early liver stage development , hepatocyte invasion prior maturation release bloodstream , 3 . Continuous suppressive prophylaxis blood-stage antimalarial drug CQ prevent development patent parasitemia clinical malaria . The study include Pilot Phase time PQ dose relative parasite exposure critical efficacy PQ causal prophylaxis yet still allow maximize antigenic exposure liver-stage parasite . The Pilot Phase compare prevention blood-stage parasitemia PQ administer two day vs. three day single ITV infection . Based protection data Pilot Phase , dose algorithm use determine timing PQ dose Main ITV Phase . In Challenge phase , occur three ITV event , sterile protective immunity assess challenge homologous P. falciparum sporozoites absence chemoprophylactic drug . Five week stop chemoprophylaxis , subject undergo experimental P. falciparum infection bite five infective mosquito closely monitor sign symptom malaria hotel set . Subjects develop patent parasitemia immediately treat standard dose Malarone withdrawn study . Treated subject continue monitor daily blood smear three consecutive daily blood smear negative residual symptom malaria mild resolve . Subjects closely monitor throughout study solicit unsolicited adverse event related part ITV immunization . The study expect last 4 9 month depend subject assign , may 64 schedule study visit time period . Subjects follow clinic 35 day challenge follow phone call conduct six month challenge . In effort evaluate duration immune response ITV , subject invited return optional evaluation three six month post challenge .</detailed_description>
