	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose schedule sirolimus give together vaccine therapy treat patient stage II-IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer . Sirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together sirolimus may effective treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine sirolimus vary dose schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness sirolimus enhance vaccine efficacy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity : peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ CD4+ T-cells ; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibody ; peripheral blood frequency CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) + regulatory T-cells . II . Explore time disease progression . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sirolimus . Patients receive ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC day 1-4 . Patients also receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 OR 15-28 OR 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive additional course ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine follow ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-I ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine SC 8 week completion course 4 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
