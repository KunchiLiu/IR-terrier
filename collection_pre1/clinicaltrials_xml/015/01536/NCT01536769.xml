	<brief_summary>The cause Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) unknown reliable biomarker identify PD patient early possible urgently need . Nerve cell near nose gut become first affected PD patient frequently suffer loss smell constipation . The nose gut harbor high amount bacteria influence body function many way , even brain . The investigator examine possible role bacteria nose gut pathogenesis PD . This may lead good understand PD cause may open new possibility diagnosis treatment . The investigator recruit 100 PD patient 100 control subject . The investigator characterize subject carefully respect clinical symptom . The investigator collect bacterial sample nose , mouth stool subject . Using modern genomic technique investigator read genetic code bacteria contain sample able identify specie bacteria present sample . Using complex cluster compute investigator compare pattern bacterial specie PD patient control look specific abnormality PD patient . If investigator detect specific difference bacterial community PD patient control may point role bacteria cause PD . Since many way influence bacterial community pharmacologically ( antibiotic , probiotic ) possible investigate whether therapy could alleviate even reverse PD symptom . Furthermore , investigator would able use difference biomarker would enable u develop quick screen test bacterial sample may reveal whether person PD . By study investigator learn whether bacteria play role development PD whether investigator use biomarker therapeutic target . So hopefully investigator able future good understand cause PD , investigator diagnose early possible cure patient PD .</brief_summary>
