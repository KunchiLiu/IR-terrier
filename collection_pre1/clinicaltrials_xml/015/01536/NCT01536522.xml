	<detailed_description>More 20 million Americans suffer asthma , nearly half asthma sufferer asthma control . Although commonly diagnose use physiological measure airflow bronchial hyperreactivity , asthma pathophysiology relate chronic inflammation airway . Current diagnostic evaluation monitoring inadequate propose practice guideline . The commonly used test evaluation asthma measurement airflow obstruction spirometry . The National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) Expert Panel Reports set forth grade asthma severity base frequency symptom , airflow , need inhale beta-agonists . Practice guideline outline goal therapy asthma : maintain normal activity near normal parameter lung function , prevent exacerbation lead tissue injury , avoid medication toxicity . In order facilitate goal , NAEPP define key component management include disease monitoring step care pharmacotherapy . Unfortunately , optimal plan monitor inflammation , cause u fail key component management asthma . Limited option anti-inflammatory treatment control asthma likewise often lead substantial morbidity due treatment high dos corticosteroid . Our AIR program plan develop novel asthma monitor test design target therapeutic , altogether may reduce toxicity improve long-term health patient . Impact broad scientific advancement . Our cumulative study provide fundamental information molecular mechanism contribute unresolving excessive inflammation lead tissue remodel . This mechanistic knowledge broad scientific importance nearly chronic human disease define prolonged active inflammation , tissue destruction , fail attempt heal . Thus , investigation provide comprehensive knowledge consequent translational deliverable may widely applicable diagnostic strategy therapies chronic inflammatory disease .</detailed_description>
