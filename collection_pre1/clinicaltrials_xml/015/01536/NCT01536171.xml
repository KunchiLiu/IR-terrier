	<brief_summary>This experimental study compare impact force metabolic cost runner ( N=20 ; age 18-45 year , already use forefoot strike run gait ) two treadmill run test session ( shod v barefoot run )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peak Impact Forces Metabolic Cost During Mid-Forefoot Striking Shod Versus Barefoot Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To identify difference metabolic cost exist barefoot versus cushion shod FM striker acute bout run exercise . Hypothesis : The metabolic cost high cushion shod runner forefoot midfoot strike compare barefoot runner . Specific Aim 2 : To identify difference peak impact force exist barefoot versus cushion shod runner forefoot-midfoot ( FM ) striker . Hypothesis : Peak impact force higher barefoot runner forefoot midfoot strike run style compare cushion shod runner forefoot midfoot strike run style .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>trained runner run foot strike style either initial forefoot midfoot strike . run average least 20 miles/week able run least 20 minute one session free orthopedic limitation history low extremity injury within last 6 month prior test rearfoot strike run style run cushion shoe occasion run average &lt; 20 miles/week unable run 20 minute great presence open wound deformity foot would prevent participant run barefoot neurologic injury would preclude normal run activity .</criteria>
