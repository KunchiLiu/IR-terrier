	<detailed_description>This 4-week non-randomized , partially blind , single-arm monocentre study subject COPD GOLD class II III aim demonstrate inhale therapy salmeterol reduce sympathetic activity evaluate microneurography . A maximum 32 subject plan enrol . During complex data registration period comprise continuous record muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) respiration various measurement Visit 1 , placebo 50 μg salmeterol via Diskus™ inhaler administer sequential design . Following Visit 1 , subject treat salmeterol 50 μg twice daily via Diskus inhaler 4 week . At Final Visit ( Visit 2 ) data registration period Visit 1 repeat difference placebo administer . Further endpoint , besides evaluation MSNA , include heart rate variability ( HRV ) , spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity lung function parameter . Study enrolment stop valid MSNA data immediate effect inhalation ( manoeuvre Visit 1 ) available 24 subject .</detailed_description>
