	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open-label study determine safety effectiveness ( well work ) two standardized treatment call `` mesalamine '' ( Pentasa® ) `` prednisone '' child newly diagnose UC . Standardized treatment type treatment agree upon use many qualified doctor . The medication use study consider `` standard care '' . Currently way medicine use ( dos , frequency dose ) may vary site site . This study determine response standardized way give medicine . This study also identify biomarkers ulcerative colitis . Biomarkers thing doctor find blood , stool , bowel tissue indicate much inflammation bowel , inflammation produce , whether inflammation respond treatment . Collecting response remission ( free symptom ) information standardize treatment `` biomarkers '' possibly help doctor create model , plan know child UC may respond quickly , child may develop complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) denote phenotype chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , inflammation localize colonic mucosa , extend rectum proximally vary extent . The disorder think result inappropriate activation mucosal immune system antigens derive host epithelium enteric flora , genetically susceptible individual . UC strikingly heterogeneous respect age onset , anatomical extent disease course , experience chronically active severe disease , others intermittent period clinical remission disease exacerbation . Patients ' therapeutic response vary . The reason underlie variability well understood . Although widely hypothesize several gene may influence development UC , modify phenotypic expression severity , date confirm example relationship . It postulate 5-aminosalicylate drug exert anti-inflammatory effect locally intestinal mucosa . Mechanisms likely include inhibition 5-lipoxygenase resulting decrease production leukotriene B4 , scavenge reactive oxygen metabolite , prevention up-regulation leukocyte adhesion molecule , inhibition IL-1 synthesis . Though multiple study show efficacy aminosalicylates induce maintain remission adult UC , data child . Corticosteroids mainstay treatment severe UC since efficacy first demonstrate 1955 randomized control trial Truelove Witts . Recent practice guideline develop adult support use rapid onset action significant efficacy though CS dependency note . Though control data use report child frequently use population . A recent report investigator lead prospective Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry describe 97 subject diagnosis UC minimum 1 year follow-up ; 79 % receive CS . At diagnosis 81 % CS treat patient moderate/severe disease , 81 % pancolitis . Clinically inactive disease , determine physician global assessment , note 60 % 3 month follow CS therapy , one year 45 % consider CS dependent despite frequent use IM . Among child initially moderate severe disease clinical remission 3 month , two-thirds stop CS one year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 4years ≤17 year initiation therapy ( achieve 4th birthday , yet 18th ) Weight ≥15 kg New diagnosis ulcerative colitis establish standard clinical , endoscopic , histologic feature PROTECT study site Colitis extend beyond rectosigmoid ( Paris classification E2 , E3 , E4 ) [ 144 ] . If patient seriously ill clinician advance colonoscope beyond sigmoid colon clinical condition patient highly suggest extensive disease patient eligible study . Disease activity PUCAI ≥10 diagnosis No therapy previously initiate treat newly diagnose ulcerative colitis Stool culture negative routine enteric pathogen ( Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , E. coli 0157 : H7 ) Clostridium difficile toxin . Recent successful treatment Clostridium difficile exclude patient toxin absent . However , patient must minimum 5 week time treatment start time toxin absent . Stool study negative enteric parasite ( ova parasite ) Parent/guardian consent patient assent Ability remain followup minimum one year diagnosis Female patient child bear age must negative urine pregnancy test practice acceptable contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , intramuscular hormonal contraception , two barrier method ( e.g. , condom , diaphragm , spermicide ) , intrauterine device , verbal report partner history vasectomy , surgically sterile ) . All female patient childbearing potential ( postmenarche ) undergo urine pregnancy test screen must lactate . Clinical , endoscopic , radiologic , histologic evidence suggest CD consistent Paris NASPGHAN criterion [ 144 , 145 ] A previous diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease treatment give Evidence active enteric infection time study entryUse oral CS nongastrointestinal indication within past 4 week ( e.g. , asthma ) . Use inhale CS exclude patient . History use IM antiTNFα agent medical condition ( e.g. , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ) within past 6 month Use Accutane within past 4 week Use investigational drug within past four week Use 5aminosalicylate within past 4 week Pregnancy Subjects poorly control medical condition ( e.g . diabetes , congestive heart failure ) Proctitis proctosigmoiditis ( Paris classification E1 ) colonoscopic evaluation Chronic renal disease ( BUN serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time upper normal limit ) Hepatic disease ( AST ALP great 3 time upper normal limit absence concomitant liver disease associate IBD follow full evaluation ) History allergy hypersensitivity salicylate , aminosalicylates , component Pentasa capsule . History coexist chronic illness evidence significant organic psychiatric disease medical history physical examination , , Investigator 's opinion , would prevent participation study History presence condition cause malabsorption effect gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility , history extensive small bowel resection ( great half length small intestine ) . The finding Helicobacter pylorus time evaluation exclude patient study . Whether treat patient Helicobacter pylorus leave discretion site .</criteria>
