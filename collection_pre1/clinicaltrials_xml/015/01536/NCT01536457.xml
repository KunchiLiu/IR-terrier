	<brief_summary>There number study attribute causality reflux disease asthma . In addition , clinician typically treat chronic asthmatic high dose acid suppress medication ( e.g . lansoprazole ) . However , clinical trial recently shed light dilemma , recent study suggest association clear . This `` retrospective '' analysis prospective study treat mod-severe asthmatic lansoprazole placebo enter collect raw data database , perform statistical analysis determine child asthma treat acid suppression improve asthma compare receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) common disorder , usually non-lethal high morbidity healthcare cost . Asthma occur 4 % - 7 % US population , one-third active asthmatic child . There universally accept definition asthma ; may regard diffuse , obstructive lung disease 1 ) hyper-reactivity airway variety stimulus ( e.g. , acid refluxate via direct exposure indirect mechanism ; i.e. , vagal innervation pathway ) 2 ) high degree reversibility obstructive process , may occur either spontaneously result treatment . Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) symptom , often result GERD , occur daily approximately 7 % - 20 % United States adult population ; yet population-based study define prevalence GERD ambulatory pediatric population exist . Conversely , recent hospital-based data demonstrate GERD , intra- supra-esophageal disease occur result GER , common pediatric condition result 4 % pediatric hospital discharge across country . Therefore , asthma GERD common disease often appear co-exist . Moreover , co-existence asthma GERD far frequent chance association . GERD symptom , although usually mild , occur 65 % - 77 % asthmatic . In addition , GERD common asthmatic , often `` silent '' , i.e . lack typical symptom heartburn . Thus , study characterize relationship two condition importantly , intervention may impact positively critically need . Moreover , data suggest GERD asthma life-long condition may childhood origin . A major unanswered question whether severity frequency asthma related response anti-reflux treatment . It also know acute intermittent reflux , meet establish criterion pathologic GER , precipitate cough presumably bronchospasm . Although 1 5 asthmatic use bronchodilator treat symptom interpret episode heartburn , clear treat bronchospasm esophageal symptom . Therefore , one aim trial see could demonstrate significant response acid-suppression therapy group poorly control childhood asthmatic use number asthma exacerbation outcome variable . If causal link GERD poor asthma control , one would expect treatment GERD would improve asthma . The Cochrane review evidence-based medicine conclude follow : `` In subject asthma GER 51 , treatment GER produce consistent improvement asthma symptom A subgroup subject report gain benefit appear difficult predict responder . At present possible recommend medical treatment GER mean control asthma . The Cochrane database analysis go recommend `` …future research warrant examine effect therapy GER asthma control . Additionally , `` …a parallel group , randomize placebo control trial ( RCT ) use proton pump inhibitor 6 month would appropriate . Such trial include assessment standardized reporting asthma symptom , quality life , lung function , symptom asthma medication diary , assessment effect therapy GER '' . Moreover , GERD asthma lifelong condition , one might speculate overall improvement health outcome adulthood achieve successful detection intervention pediatric age group . Therefore , result randomize placebo , control treatment trial one complete yet analyze surely achieve major health benefit child adult suffer asthma GERD , ultimately change clinical practice result reduction overall public health burden incur chronic human condition . It important Institutional Review Board Committee recognize actual `` clinical trial '' part study complete . This IRB proposal submit perform perhaps critical aspect study ; data entry raw data secure electronic database , statistical analysis interpretation - final step feel patient parent eager complete , one hope significant impact scientific community - advancing science behind understand relationship asthma GERD . More importantly , feel complete objective new concept proposal - analyze interpret data obtain clinical trial , prove hypothesis - treatment GERD moderate severe childhood asthmatic actually help asthma outcome - thereby demonstrate childhood critical period intervene modify successfully alter natural history two devastating , chronic disease life-long morbidity healthcare impact ( i.e . asthma GERD ) . The actual clinical trial complete first investigator initiate trial principal investigator co-investigators . After IRB approval obtain IRB # 1107-2005 , study enrol first patient March 2006 last patient December 2008 . The study also register www.clinical trials.gov October 11 , 2005 . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) charter form meet total 2 time one final meeting arrange . An external study monitor perform monitor visit first year study order assure proper protocol compliance , regulatory compliance study procedure conductance . The study complete largely due incredible effort GPPA coordinator Co-investigator . At present , study close , patient enrol , mention , patient either complete study , withdrawn ( early termination ) drop study due lack ability follow . The study currently retain `` blind '' raw data collect , data remains source document ( i.e . CRFs ) data enter secure electronic database , subsequently , thus , data analysis occur , interpretation provide study conclusion draw .</detailed_description>
