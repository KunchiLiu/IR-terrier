	<detailed_description>The LION-HEART study ( Levosimendan® Intermittent administration Outpatients : effect Natriuretic peptide advance chronic HEART failure ) multicenter , double-blind , randomize , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety intravenous administration intermittent dose levosimendan outpatient advance chronic heart failure . Study Design Oversight Between November 2010 December 2012,69 patient fulfil inclusion criterion enrol 12 recruiting center Spain ( Figure 1 ) . The study protocol approve institutional review board participate center conduct accordance principle Declaration Helsinki ( 1996 ) , International Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice , local national regulation . All enrol patient provide write informed consentbefore study-related procedure undertaken . The study register website www.ClinicalTrials.gov ( unique identifier : NCT01536132 ) EudraCT database ( 2009-014242-28 ) . The trial design , implement overseen Steering Committee . On-site monitoring study , data collection data management perform Clinical Research Organization ( CRO , 3DHealth ) . The manuscript write submit Steering Committee member . All contribute author full access study data analysis . Study population , eligibility recruitment The study divide three different part : 1 ) screening ( 1 week ) , 2 ) treatment ( 12 week ) 3 ) follow-up ( 12 week ) . An additional vital status assessment plan 12 month enrolment ( Figure 2 , design study ) . Eligibility assess screen phase , write informed consent obtain . Inclusion criterion study : age 18 year , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less 35 % measure previous 6 month clinical diagnosis advance chronic HF ( Metra M et al . Eur J Heart Fail 2007 ; 9 ( 6-7 ) :684-694 ) accord follow criterion : ) presence &gt; 3 month typical sign symptom HF b ) persistent ambulatory NYHA functional class III IV last 4 week , c ) sign congestion low cardiac output time enrolment , ) episodes pulmonary and/or systemic congestion require intravenous administration diuretic ( either hospitalize ambulatory basis ) previous 12 month , e ) previous criterion present despite optimal medical management ( include use diuretic , antagonists renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system beta-blockers ) device therapy ( include implantable cardioverter defibrillator-ICD and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy-CRT ) attempt optimize . Major exclusion criterion : concurrent inclusion another study , presence leave ventricular tract obstruction , uncorrected significant primary valve disease , recent acute coronary syndrome stroke , hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy , administration amrinone , milrinone , enoximone , dopamine dobutamine previous 3 day , administration levosimendan previous 31 day , serum potassium 3.5mmol/L , estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30ml/min/m2 ( MDRD-4 formula ) , systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg orheart rate &gt; 110 bpm screening , plan ongoing evaluation follow procedure : CRT , ICD , coronary revascularization , heart transplant leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) implant , acute chronic condition would make patient unsuitable study accord investigator 's judgement , anticipate poor compliance inability unwillingness give inform consent . Randomization Blinding Eligible patient sign informed consent randomize 2:1 ratio receive either Levosimendan placebo . Randomization centrally conduct supervised CRO . The computer-generated randomization scheme use random permuted block stratify per center . Once patient allocate Levosimendan placebo , CRO communicate exact treatment number local hospital pharmacy hand treatment local investigator infusion cycle . Levosimendan placebo appearance thus treatment conceal investigator study patient ( double blind ) . Therapy Patients randomize 2:1 ratio receive either Levosimendan placebo ( i.e . two patient assign Levosimendan every one patient assign placebo ) intermittent dosing ( every two week ) 6-hour intravenous infusion ( 0.2 μg / kg / min without bolus ) period 12 week ( 6 cycle ) study patient advance chronic heart failure.In case hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg &lt; 100 mmHg symptom ) clinical intolerance drug , dose could reduce 0.01 μg /kg/min . Furtherreduction 0.05μg/kg/min discontinuation drug waspossible adverse effect persisted.Study treatment administer maximum 12 week ambulatory administration set allow non-invasive monitoring vital sign . During first infusion , 24-hour ECG monitoring ( either ambulatory Holter monitoring telemetry ) require safety evaluation . After treatment period , patient follow every 4 week 12 additional week . At end study , patient follow maximum 12 month - i.e . last visit ( vital status assessment ) perform 9 month last administration study treatment . Data collection Baseline information obtain stable patient without sign fluid overload low-cardiac output write informed consent . These data include medical history , hospitalization , relevant clinical demographic information physical examination mean direct interview , examination medical record review include NYHA class , recent LVEF , medical therapy 12-lead ECG . These data , include occurrence adverse event hospitalization re-evaluated every two week first 3 month every 4 week next 3 month . Additional evaluation baseline include self-assessment patient report outcome ( PRO , include health-related quality life-HR-QoL- evaluate mean generic EQ-5D HF specific Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , KCCQ ) , local laboratory measurement , distance walk 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . PRO 6 MWT re-evaluated week 13 week 25 . Vital status assessment also perform 12 month inclusion study . Measurements serum amino-terminal B-type pro-natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP , pg/mL ) perform locally immunoassay base chemiluminescence use Elecsys System ( Roche® ) 24 h initiation study drug infusion ( either Levosimendan placebo ) . Follow-up Evaluation end-points The primary end-point efficacy LION-HEART study determine , relative placebo , effect 6 cycle ambulatory 6-hour intravenous infusion levosimendan every two week concentration NT-proBNP throughout 12-week treatment period patient advance chronic heart failure . Secondary End-points safety efficacy The secondary objective efficacy include evaluation effect drug compare placebo functional variable include NYHA class , patient center outcome include HR-QoL , relative change value NT-proBNP baseline end treatment unplanned hospitalization ( HF , cardiovascular reason all-cause ) . As additional pre-specified efficacy end-points report combine all-cause death terminal event ( urgent LVAD heart transplant ) hospitalization plan . The safety objective aim evaluate effect study drug compare placebo all-cause mortality , change renal liver function . The impact administration study drug heart rate risk development life-threatening arrhythmia investigate patient study . All adverse event , serious non-serious prospectively evaluate record . Data safety regularly review medical personnel CRO without contact investigator patient ongoing basis accord qualification major event ( death , readmission ) adverse event . Since allocation patient study drug placebo conceal , adjudication adverse event secondary efficacy end-points ( include death hospitalization ) undertake local principal investigator recruit center . For efficacy , safety tolerability evaluation , intention treat analysis undertaken patient receive least one study drug infusion . Adverse event report follow Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MeDRA ) definition .</detailed_description>
