	<brief_title>Safety Study Assess Whether Proinsulin Peptide Injections Can Slow Stop Body Damaging Its Own Insulin-making Cells Pancreas Patients Newly Diagnosed With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Diabetes ( also know insulin−dependent diabetes ) cause destruction insulin produce cell ( Beta Cells ) pancreas . Our group interested destruction could stop reverse , may lead development new generation diabetes treatment prevent slow damage , reduce possibly even remove need insulin injection . In previous study examine safety novel approach problem , proinsulin ( PI ) peptide immunotherapy , longstanding diabetes patient ( diagnose 5 year ) , find well tolerate free major hypersensitivity reaction . However , remain theoretically possible form immunotherapy could make immune reaction insulin make cell bad rather well . This study directly longstanding patient almost insulin make cell leave . So , principle objective current study address safety issue whether , patient newly−diagnosed diabetes still make insulin , proinsulin peptide therapy adversely affect rate damage insulin make cell .</detailed_description>
