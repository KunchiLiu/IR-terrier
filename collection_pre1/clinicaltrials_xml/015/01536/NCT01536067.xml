	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give ofatumumab together bortezomib work treat patient previously untreated Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia . Monoclonal antibody , ofatumumab bortezomib , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving ofatumumab together bortezomib may better way block cancer growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Bortezomib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + minor response [ MR ] ) ofatumumab combination bortezomib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete remission ( CR ) rate , near ( n ) CR rate , good partial response ( VGPR ) rate PR rate per new criterion . II . Determine 5 year progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . Determine time progression duration response ofatumumab conjunction bortezomib . IV . Determine safety ofatumumab combination bortezomib . V. Conduct laboratory correlate . OUTLINE : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) day 8 15 . Beginning course 2 , patient receive ofatumumab IV day 1 15 bortezomib SC day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Beginning 8 week course 4 induction phase , patient receive ofatumumab IV day 1 bortezomib SC day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
