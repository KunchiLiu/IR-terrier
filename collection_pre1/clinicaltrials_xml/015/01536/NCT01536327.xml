	<detailed_description>Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) one group genetic disorder call leukodystrophies . These disease impair growth development myelin sheath , fatty cover act insulator around nerve fiber . Myelin , lend color white matter brain , complex substance make vary lipid ( 75 % ) proteins ( 25 % ) . The leukodystrophies cause genetic defect myelin production metabolization compound myelin sheath . Each leukodystrophies result defect gene control one ( one ) enzymes responsible create degrade part myelin . MLD cause deficiency enzyme arylsulfatase A. MLD one several lipid storage disease , result toxic build-up fatty material ( lipid ) cell nervous system , liver , kidney . There three form MLD : late infantile , juvenile , adult . Onset late infantile form ( common MLD ) typically 12 20 month follow birth . Affected child difficulty walk first year life . Symptoms include muscle waste weakness , muscle rigidity , developmental delay , progressive loss vision lead blindness , convulsion , impair swallowing , paralysis , dementia . Children may become comatose . Most child form MLD die age 5 . The juvenile form MLD ( 3-10 year age ) usually begin impaired school performance , mental deterioration , dementia develop symptom similar infantile form slow progression . The adult form commonly begin age 16 psychiatric disorder progressive dementia . Symptoms include impaired concentration , ataxia , seizure , dementia , tremor . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study develop new biochemical marker plasma affected patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
