	<brief_summary>GSK market drug call levothyroxine T4 use treat patient hypothyroidism . Till date , active drug substance active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) levothyroxine tablet market India obtain particular source . GSK India propose change source API exist source new source . Some patient may experience change clinical effect switch one formulation another . Therefore study do understand whether change API levothyroxine tablet impact clinical effect drug . The purpose study : See quickly levothyroxine tablet new source ( single dose 600mcg ) enters bloodstream , distribute body , break remove compare levothyroxine tablet exist source ( single dose 600mcg ) . Study effect single 600mcg dos levothyroxine tablet new source levothyroxine tablet exist source TSH level blood . Study safety side effect single 600mcg dos levothyroxine tablet new source levothyroxine tablet exist source .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Levothyroxine ( T4 ) use treat patient hypothyroidism may often result lifelong therapy . Its physiologically active metabolite tri-iodothyronine ( T3 ) . Levothyroxine also endogenously produce body . Since small change levothyroxine administration ( e.g . change brand formulation ) cause significant change serum thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) concentration , precise accurate TSH control critical avoid potential adverse iatrogenic effect . Till date , active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) levothyroxine tablet market India source company 1 . GSK India propose change source API exist source ( company 1 ) new source ( company 2 ) . In view change source API , essential determine whether impact drug product performance base pharmacokinetic ( PK ) measure total serum T4 total serum T3 to-be-marketed formulation levothyroxine ( test formulation company 2 , Treatment A ) relative formulation currently market ( reference formulation company 1 , Treatment B ) . This single-center , open-label , two-period , two-treatment , two-sequence , randomize , single-dose , crossover study . 26 healthy adult male randomize receive single dose ( 6 x 100mcg tablet = 600mcg ) test formulation levothyroxine reference formulation levothyroxine separately treatment period . There two treatment sequence ( AB , BA ) 35 day washout two treatment period . The study conduct BA/BE facility approval independent ethic committee . Subjects screen visit within 21 day prior first dose study drug , two treatment period contain single dose study drug , follow 48 hour serial PK sample collection . Subjects check unit Day 3 ( 7am ) collection 48 hour PK sample . The subject instruct return next treatment period final follow-up visit , appropriate . The final follow-up visit occur 35 day last dose study drug . Subjects assign two treatment randomly per randomization schedule .</detailed_description>
