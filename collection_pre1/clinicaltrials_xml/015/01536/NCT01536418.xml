	<brief_title>An Active Treatment Study Induce Clinical Response and/or Remission With GSK1605786A Subjects With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , double-blind , randomise , active treatment , parallel group study design induce clinical response and/or clinical remission two oral dos GSK1605786A ( 500 milligram daily , 500 milligram twice daily ) 12-week treatment period subject moderately-to-severely active Crohn 's disease . The primary objective study qualify subject enrolment follow 52 week maintenance study CCX114157 . Subjects achieve induction clinical response ( CDAI decrease baseline least 100 point ) remission ( CDAI score less 150 ) Week 12 follow treatment GSK1605786A eligible enrolment maintenance study CCX114157 . Secondary objective include assessment safety evaluation efficacy induction clinical response remission . The study plan randomise approximately 900 subject ( 450 subject per group ) active Crohn 's disease diagnose least 4 month , document history disease small and/or large intestine , characterise CDAI score 220 450 ( inclusive ) . Subjects require evidence current active inflammation elevate C-reactive protein ( great upper limit normal highly sensitive C-reactive protein test ) OR elevate level faecal calprotectin . Subjects allow participate study continue stable dos agent typically use treat Crohn 's disease . Inclusion subject receive prior treatment anti-tumor necrosis factor agent discontinue due loss lack efficacy limit approximately 50 percent study population . Following 3-week screening period , subject randomise baseline receive blind treatment one two dos GSK1605786A ( 500 milligram daily twice daily ) 12 week . All subject meet definition responder ( CDAI decrease baseline least 100 point ) remission ( CDAI score less 150 point ) Week 12 eligible randomisation ongoing maintenance study ( CCX114157 ) . Subjects meet definition responder remission Week 12 eligible participate study CCX114157 . For subject complete study minimum duration participation 15 week maximum duration 19 week .</detailed_description>
