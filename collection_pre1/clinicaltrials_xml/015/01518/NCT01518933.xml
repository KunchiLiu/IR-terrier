	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -related liver disease continue common indication liver transplantation ( LT ) United States Europe . However , LT cure infection , re-infection liver allograft universally occur . Recurrent HCV hepatitis often follow accelerated course LT , histological recurrence occur approximately 50 % patient within 1 year LT ; 15-30 % develop cirrhosis within 5 year . In context , peculiar feature represent rapid course liver fibrosis . Therapeutic strategy manage primary cause liver damage , i.e . HCV infection , irrespective application pre- , peri- , and/or post-LT period result limited efficacy tolerability LT recipient . In view postulate safety profile , Silibinin seem ideal drug use set HCV recurrent patient liver transplantation . Silibinin , flavonolignan represent main component ( 60 % ) Silymarin propose anti-hepatotoxic agent treatment various liver disease recently report beneficially modulate pro-fibrogenic potential HSC , thus represent attractive possibility transplant population . Besides anti-inflammatory property , Silibinin able inhibit Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) . This proinflammatory cytokine major role acute chronic viral , bacterial fungal infection . The primary objective determine effect post-transplant treatment Legalon SIL HCV viral load 30 day begin treatment . 44 stable liver transplanted patient HCV recurrence randomize 3:1 receive Legalon-SIL Placebo . Randomized patient treat 14 consecutive day Legalon-SIL Placebo . Patients dropping-out end treatment period replace . Patients follow 1 year monitor effect treatment liver fibrosis , liver functional state , lymphocyte activation , viral load .</detailed_description>
