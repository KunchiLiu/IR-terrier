	<brief_summary>This multicenter open label non randomize phase II clinical trial Weekly Cabazitaxel Advanced Prostate Cancer Hormone-Refractory Patients Previously Treated Docetaxel . The purpose study evaluate activity weekly administration cabazitaxel time progression PSA week 12 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Weekly Cabazitaxel Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy three-weekly cabazitaxel accompany appreciable rate serious side effect toxic death . The toxicity rate observe , include grade III-IV neutropenia , febrile neutropenia diarrhea , could obstacle use management drug , hand , demonstrate great activity . In treatment patient prostate cancer , large number morbidity patient breast cancer , assume risk transition clinical trial clinical practice drug use much risk side effect , cost , discomfort derive routine use G-CSF lack patient compliance type regimens . Rates neuropathy , nail conjunctive toxicity new taxane relevant , suggest weekly administration produce relevant toxicity problem . Weekly administration taxanes improve hematologic tolerance along well therapeutic range case , increase dose intensity activity without increase associate toxicity . Phase I study report study weekly administration cabazitaxel , recommend dose 10 mg/m2 , administer day 1 , 8 , 15 22 every 5 week 1-hour infusion , diarrhea dose-limiting toxicity observe study . Given pharmacokinetic characteristic taxane activity toxicity profile , cabazitaxel might good candidate study weekly administration regimen patient prostate cancer great risk toxicity associate treatment every 3 week , patient receive previous pelvic radiation therapy affect 25 % bone marrow reserve , patient 75 year bad performance status ( ECOG 2 ) already experience important hematologic toxicity previous treatment docetaxel .</detailed_description>
