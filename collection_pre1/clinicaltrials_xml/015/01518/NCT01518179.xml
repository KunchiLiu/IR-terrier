	<brief_summary>Distal Radius Fractures among common orthopedic injury . Rehabilitation may characterize pain , stiffness , swell , decrease range motion ( hand finger ) , grip strength . Compression glove use enhance rehabilitation various clinical condition injury . However , report effect compression glove follow Distal Radius Fracture ( DRF ) . This study aim assess incremental effect wear Made-to-Measure Compression Gloves rehabilitation follow DRF . Working Hypothesis : The addition Made-to-Measure Compression Gloves routine follow treatment enhance rehabilitation , compare routine follow treatment , patient follow Distal Radius Fracture . ICD 10 , Version 2010 , condition include study ( define jointly Distal Radius Fractures ) : S52.5 Fracture low end radius ( Colles ' fracture , Smith 's fracture ) S52.6 Fracture low end ulna radius S52.7 Multiple fracture forearm Excl . : fracture ulna radius : low end ( S52.6 ) , shaft ( S52.4 ) . S52.8 Fracture part forearm ( Lower end ulna , Head ulna )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals refer rehabilitation follow DRF invited participate study . After obtain informed consent individual randomize receive routine follow treatment without compression glove . Individuals randomize make measure compression glove receive within week enrolment . All participate individual assess occupational therapist enrolment 2 , 4 , 8 week enrolment . Additional telephone interview , assess long term effect , conduct 3 , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
