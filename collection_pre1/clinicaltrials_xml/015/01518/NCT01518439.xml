	<brief_summary>Inefficient cough responsible respiratory complication neuromuscular patient lead hospitalisation life threaten . Techniques enhance cough efficiency successful improve clearance bronchial secretion help non invasive ventilation efficiency especially case acute respiratory failure . Combining mechanical exsufflation manual technique physiotherapy might enhance efficiency . Therefore investigator want compare cough efficiency different technique instrumental manual cough assistance order determine best combination optimize cough flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Cough inefficiency neuromuscular patient increase morbidity mortality case airway infection may lead invasive ventilation . The use technique enhance cough successful improve success non invasive ventilation . We want determine whether add manual physiotherapist technique mechanical exsufflation improve cough efficiency ability clear bronchial secretion . Objectives : To compare cough flow obtain different combination use increase inspiratory capacity technique , mechanical insufflation-exsufflation technique manually applied pressure technique . Method : open monocentric cross-over study ( patient control ) . Five combination cough increase technique compare Inclusion criterion : adult neuromuscular patient cough inefficiency stable state upon inclusion . As pilot study , 20 patient home ventilation unit intensive care Raymond Poincare teach hospital ( Garches , France ) include usual follow-up chronic respiratory failure .</detailed_description>
