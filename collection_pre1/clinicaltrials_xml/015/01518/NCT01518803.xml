	<detailed_description>Excess body weight lead World Health Organization call global epidemic . Obesity major impact development cardiovascular disease related condition particular concern child . The prevalence childhood overweight obesity Spain among high European continent . The health consequence obesity child evident adult , childhood obesity associate disease think apply adult , metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance important risk factor subject severe obesity , together visceral obesity , exacerbate postprandial triglyceridemia , increase cardiovascular risk . However , appropriately studied child moment . The excellent result previous project carry research group show beneficial property olive oil health , main ingredient Mediterranean Diet , include improve postprandial lipid pattern . In context , hypothesis postprandial lipid metabolism also impaired obese pre-adolescents , obese adult . This include exacerbated postprandial triglyceridemia , also impaired level inflammation marker . In addition , hypothesize lipid protein composition postprandial chylomicron chylomicron remnant also alter obese child compare normal-weight counterpart , postprandial lipoprotein induce foam cell formation differently , well different release inflammation marker macrophage . However , also part hypothesis , Mediterranean-style meal , administrate breakfast help normalize altered postprandial lipid metabolism obese child . With aim , carry dietary intervention study randomize , crossover design single meal , order measure change postprandial lipid metabolism pre-adolescents adult affect obesity compare effect Mediterranean-style breakfast . Chylomicron remnant isolate blood serum fully characterize . These particle incubate monocyte cell line determine effect cellular lipid metabolism production inflammatory factor . In addition , influence obesity composition structure plasma membrane also assess . The result generate knowledge pathophysiology obesity child contribute dietary recommendation weight maintenance population . Furthermore , provide information development atherosclerosis postprandial period , may begin young age .</detailed_description>
