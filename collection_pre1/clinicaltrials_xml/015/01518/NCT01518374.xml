	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enroll study : 1 . Male female subject least 18 year age ; 2 . Subjects sign IRB approve informed consent prior study procedure . Where subject deem incapable informed consent , legally authorize representative may provide consent , subject 's documented assent ; 3 . Subjects opinion investigator tolerate PET scan procedure . Subjects exclude enrollment : 1 . Have clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic , endocrine disturbance indicate history , opinion investigator might pose potential safety risk subject ; 2 . Have current clinically significant cardiovascular disease . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease usually include one following : cardiac surgery myocardial infarction within last 4 week ; unstable angina ; acute decompensated congestive heart failure class IV heart failure ; current significant cardiac arrhythmia conduction disturbance , particularly result ventricular fibrillation , cause syncope , near syncope ; uncontrolled high blood pressure ; QTc &gt; 450 msec ( history patient cardiac disease screen evaluation companion study ) Before enrol patient condition , investigator must perform cardiac evaluation obtain permission sponsor . 3 . Have history drug alcohol abuse within last year , prior prolonged history abuse ; 4 . Women childbearing potential surgically sterile , refrain sexual activity use reliable method contraception . Women childbearing potential must pregnant ( negative urine betahCG time screen negative urine betahCG day image ) breastfeed screen . Women must avoid become pregnant , must agree refrain sexual activity use reliable contraceptive method 24 hour follow administration Florbetapir F 18 Injection ( oral contraceptive least three month IUD least two month prior start screen visit , various barrier method , e.g. , diaphragm combination condom spermicide ) ; 5 . Have history relevant severe drug allergy hypersensitivity ( Relevant severe drug allergy determine PI , question subject 's eligibility direct Avid . If subject history severe drug allergy , may dangerous participate study ) ; 6 . Are patient receive investigational medication FDA IND protocol within last 30 day . Additionally , time last dose previous experimental medication enrollment ( completion screen assessment ) must least equal 5 time terminal halflife previous experimental medication . Patients ever participate experimental study amyloid target therapy ( e.g. , immunotherapy , secretase inhibitor ) may enrol without prior sponsor approval unless demonstrated patient receive placebo course trial ; 7 . Are patient current clinically significant unstable medical comorbidities , indicate history physical exam , pose potential safety risk subject . 8 . Are patient receive radiopharmaceutical imaging therapy within past 24 hour prior image session study . If another radiotracer require companion protocol , patient may able receive radiopharmaceutical imaging therapy within 24 hour prior image session prior sponsor approval discretion investigator . ; 9 . Are patient , opinion investigator , otherwise unsuitable study type . If time enrollment subject meet eligibility criterion , subject may still enrol documentation provide demonstrate subject meet criterion time first imaging procedure .</criteria>
