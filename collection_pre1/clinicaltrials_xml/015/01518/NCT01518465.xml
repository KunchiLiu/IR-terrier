	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase II trial study well give dalteparin , lenalidomide , low-dose dexamethasone together work treat patient previously untreated multiple myeloma . Anticoagulants , dalteparin , may help prevent blood clot form patient treat lenalidomide dexamethasone multiple myeloma . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving dalteparin , lenalidomide , dexamethasone together may effective treatment multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dalteparin , Lenalidomide , Low-Dose Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To select dose Dalteparin use Lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone future trial patient previously untreated multiple myeloma ( MM ) , base toxicity , select biomarkers ( M-spike , interleukin [ IL ] -6 ) relate response marker coagulation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR = complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) , time progression ( TTP ) regimen two Dalteparin dos . II . To evaluate safety profile regimen untreated MM patient , two Dalteparin dos . III . To study effect Dalteparin alone , combination lenalidomide/dexamethasone serum biomarkers multiple myeloma ( MM ) thrombosis . IV . To explore possible association ORR incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) serial syndecan-1 , IL-6 , tyrosine aminotransferase ( TAT ) , D-dimer , P-selectin level . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive prophylactic dose dalteparin subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-28 ; lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 ; low-dose dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . ARM II : Patients receive therapeutic dose dalteparin SC day 1-21 lenalidomide PO low-dose dexamethasone PO Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients residual respond disease may receive 2 additional course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
