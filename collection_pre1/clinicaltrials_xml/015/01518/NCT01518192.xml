	<brief_summary>Background : - While doxycycline standard antibiotic treatment erythema migrans Europe well USA , effectiveness cefuroxime axetil treatment adult patient erythema migrans assess USA causative agent Lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi , Europe main etiologic agent B. afzelii B. garinii . - Controversy exist significance even existence post-Lyme disease symptom high rate similar background symptom general population . Purpose : The two main purpose European , prospective clinical trial doxycycline cefuroxime axetil compare treatment adult patient erythema migrans include control group address significance post-Lyme disease symptom : - To assess compare effectiveness doxycycline cefuroxime axetil treatment erythema migrans use clinical bacteriological criterion ( noninferiority test approach ) , - compare frequency post-Lyme disease symptom adult patient treat EM antibiotic frequency similar symptom control subject without Lyme disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Doxycycline Cefuroxime Axetil Treatment Erythema Migrans : Clinical Microbiological Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample size Decisions base following : 1 . Number patient erythema migrans treat doxycycline cefuroxime axetil determine assume difference treatment outcome detect ( non-inferiority testing ) . 2 . The decision large sample size need 1. do intention evaluate secondary outcome measure , i.e. , assess difference frequency new increase symptom patient treat early Lyme disease occurrence symptom control subject . 1 . We assume outcomes two treatment group comparable patient could combine analysis . 2 . To obtain control group geographical area , patient ask family member friend within 5 year age without history Lyme borreliosis . These person approach short write explanation investigation , contain also request participation . We assume able get correspond control person approximately 80-90 % patient . 3 . Under assumption approximately 15 % estimate 200 patient would new increase symptom &gt; 6 month enrollment study , control group 165 subject would sufficient detect &gt; 10 percentage point low rate new increase symptom control compare patient 0.05 level ( 2-sided ) &gt; 90 % power . To comply drop out different time point assess 280 patient 230 control include baseline .</detailed_description>
