	<brief_title>Breathing-swallowing Interaction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients - Impact Non Invasive Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In healthy subject previous study show swallow start expiration follow expiration , pattern believe contribute airway protection swallow . However In healthy individual , occurrence inspiration swallow increase hypercapnia application inspiratory elastic load . In previous study investigator demonstrate patient neuromuscular disorder exhibit piecemeal deglutition lead increase time need swallow water bolus , well occurrence inspiration nearly half swallow . These abnormality increase decrease respiratory muscle performance may explain feed difficulty . However tracheostomized patient could breathe spontaneously , piecemeal deglutition swallow time per bolus diminish use mechanical ventilation . In investigator ' knowledge data impact non invasive mechanical ventilation breathing-swallowing interaction . The investigator ' main objective evaluate breathing-swallowing interaction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient hospitalize intensive care unit acute exacerbation , evaluate impact use non invasive mechanical ventilation ( NIV )</detailed_description>
