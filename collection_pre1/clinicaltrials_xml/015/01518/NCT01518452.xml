	<brief_title>Computerized Working Memory Training Very-low-birth-weight Children Preschool Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children born preterm increase risk neurological disability due perinatal brain damage . During last ten year increase number especially extremely low birth weight ( ELBW : BW ≤ 1000g ) child survive , one might wonder whether lead increase amount brain pathology impairment among survivor . Major impairment include cerebral palsy , mental retardation impair vision hearing common child bear extremely preterm ( gestational age 28 week ) . In addition , large part survivor preterm birth experience motor problem , cognitive dysfunction , psychiatric behavioural problem vary severity . In previous research find significant deficit work memory preterm born child , seem strong influence cognitive functioning . During last year , several study show work memory skill train , train work memory improve cognition executive function regard one major step forward neuroscience recent year . The work memory train program version preschooler , Cogmed JM , recently launch . Healthy preschooler train work memory improve significantly trained task also non-trained test spatial verbal work memory , well transfer effect attention . The preschool version program yet administer preterm bear neurologic high risk child age group . The main aim prospective interventional study compare quantitative EEG finding cognitive neuropsychological test result train Cogmed JM program group very-low-birth-weight child preschool age , i.e . age 5-6 year . We hypothesise child study may respond positively computerized training improve work memory , probably different degree depend underlying neurological condition . We also hypothesise training may benefit additional executive function . The child study divide two subgroup ( 15/15 child ) . Subgroup A start training , subgroup B wait first training period . Subgroup B therefore act control group . After 8 week subgroup B start training . This agreement so-called Stepped Wedge design ( Brown Lilford 2006 ) .</detailed_description>
