	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Sorafenib Irinotecan Combination Therapy Pediatric Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib , multi-kinase inhibitor several target felt important tumor growth angiogenesis , well study show promising clinical result adult cancer patient Maximum Tolerated Dose MTD determine pediatric patient . Irinotecan know effective widely use pediatric malignancy . The combination sorafenib irinotecan interest agent different mechanisms action . In addition , combination evaluate adult patient deem tolerable without alteration pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile MTD . The trial proposing also offer advantage completely oral regimen , add convenience cost effectiveness . Given consideration , sorafenib/irinotecan combination prove tolerable phase I study show efficacy phase II study , would attractive combination incorporate exist chemotherapy regimen pediatric cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AGE : &gt; =2 year &lt; 22 year age . DIAGNOSIS : solid tumor , may include limited rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor , osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma , Wilms ' tumor , hepatic tumor , germ cell tumor brain tumor . MEASURABLE/EVALUABLE DISEASE : Patients must measurable evaluable disease . THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS : The patient 's cancer must relapse failed respond frontline curative therapy must potentially curative treatment option available . Curative therapy may include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , combination modality . • PRIOR THERAPY : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enrol study . No limitation number prior chemotherapy regimen patient may receive prior study enrollment . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : The last dose myelosuppressive anticancer drug must least 3 week prior study entry . Immunotherapy : The last dose immunotherapy ( monoclonal antibody vaccine ) must least 4 week prior study entry . Biologic ( anticancer agent ) : The last dose biologic agent treatment patient 's cancer ( retinoids tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) must least 7 day prior study entry . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss study chair . Investigational anticancer agent : The last dose investigational agent must least 30 day prior study entry . Radiation therapy : The last dose radiation 25 % marrow contain bone ( pelvis , spine , skull ) must least 4 week prior study entry . The last dose local palliative ( limited port ) radiation must least 2 week prior study entry . Stem Cell Transplantation . At least 2 month postautologous stem cell transplant least 3 month postallogeneic transplant recover toxicity without evidence graft versus host disease . Prior camptothecins : Patients previously receive irinotecan front line treatment adjuvant set eligible experience severe toxicity ( define grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity failure recover nonhematologic hematologic toxicity within 6 week receive drug ) possibly , probably definitely related agent , experience tumor progression time receive agent . Patients previously receive topotecan eligible . Growth Factors . The last dose colony stimulate factor , filgrastim , sargramostim , erythropoietin , must least 1 week prior study entry , last dose longacting colony stimulate factor , pegfilgrastim , must least 2 week prior study entry . • CONCURRENT THERAPIES : No anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy ) permit . • PERFORMANCE STATUS : Patients &gt; 10 year old must Karnofsky performance level &gt; = 50 % , child &lt; = 10 year old must Lansky performance level &gt; = 50 % . Patients unable walk paralysis motor weakness , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . • HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; =750/mcL Platelet count &gt; =75,000/mcL without administration platelet • HEPATIC FUNCTION : Total bilirubin must gender SGPT ( ALT ) must Serum albumin &gt; /= 2 g/dL RENAL FUNCTION : Ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( see table ) OR creatinine clearance &gt; =60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( Years ) ( mg/dl ) Male Female 2 less 6 year 0.8 0.8 6 less 10 year 1 1 10 less 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 year less 16 year 1.5 1.4 Greater equal 16 year 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine value table derive Schwartz formula estimate GFR ( Schwartz et.al . J Peds 106:522 , 1985 ) utilize child length stature data publish CDC . ADEQUATE PULMONARY FUNCTION : Defined dyspnea rest , exercise intolerance , pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % room air clinical indication determination ( cough , etc ) . Normal serum amylase lipase PT PTT &lt; = 1.5 time upper limit normal age ( include patient prophylactic anticoagulation ) . Prophylactic anticoagulation describe permit : Low dose warfarin PTINR &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . For subject receive warfarin , PTINR measure prior initiation trial drug monitor least weekly , define local standard care , stable . Lowdose aspirin ( &lt; = 100 mg daily ) . Prophylactic dos heparin . Blood pressure ( BP ) &lt; = 95th percentile age , height gender receive antihypertensive medication well control antihypertensive medication one week . Blood pressure record average 2 measurement separate least 2 minute . If second value 5 mmHg different first , continue measurement make every 2 minute stable value attain . The recorded value average last two measurement obtain . Blood pressure measure preferably right arm appropriate size cuff , take seated position 3 minute rest . Oscillometric blood pressure measurement exceed 95th percentile confirm auscultation . BIRTH CONTROL : Patients childbearing childfathering potential require must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection , hepatic , renal organ dysfunction , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate agent use trial likely interfere study procedure result . Patients know intraaxial metastatic central nervous system lesion . Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude potential harmful effect sorafenib irinotecan develop fetus nursing child . Patients currently receive anticancer agent radiation therapy . Patients currently receive investigational agent . Prior treatment sorafenib contain regimen . Inability swallow pill . Evidence bleed diathesis and/or therapeutic anticoagulation medication . Patients know Gilbert syndrome . Patients take cytochrome P450 enzymeinducing antiepileptic agent ( phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbitol ) , rifampin , erythromycin , azithromycin , azole antifungal , grape fruit juice St. Johns Wort . Patients must discontinue medication least 7 day prior enrollment trial . Patients baseline hypertension ( &gt; =95th BP percentile age , height gender ) control antihypertensive medication .
