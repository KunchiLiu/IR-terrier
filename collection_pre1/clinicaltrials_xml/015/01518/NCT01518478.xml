	<brief_summary>A new flu vaccine inject skin instead muscle recently approve Food Drug Administration vaccination general population include patient atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . This new vaccine show work well vaccine inject muscle test people without atopic dermatitis . The primary endpoint study estimate variance log fold change baseline HAI antibody titer non-atopic control participant atopic dermatitis without history eczema herpeticum ( ADEH- ) , follow administration single dose seasonal 2011-2012 Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atopic Dermatitis Research Network ( ADRN ) Influenza Vaccine Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label , mechanistic study design determine variance antibody response non-atopic ADEH- participant receive single dose 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administer per label . Twenty non-atopic 20 ADEH- ( mild severe AD ) adult age 18 64 year enrol . Enrollment closely monitor ensure similar distribution non-atopic ADEH- participant gender , age , race/ethnicity . Eligible study participant provide pre-vaccination blood sample ( Day 0 ) assessment baseline HAI antibody titer , cellular immune response , total IgE , allergen sensitization , receive single injection 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administer per label . A subset participant also provide blood microarray analysis Baseline ( Day 0 ) return clinic 3 7 day post-vaccination provide additional blood microarray analysis . All participant return study site 28 day post-vaccination blood draw HAI antibody titer cellular immune response assay . Study participant follow safety , include serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , throughout entire duration study ask record solicit AEs diary card ( Days 0-7 ) .</detailed_description>
