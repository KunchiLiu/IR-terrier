	<brief_summary>This research project aim find multiplayer online video game provide therapeutic benefit people survive brain injury . Video game provide therapeutic benefit many context ( Griffiths , 2005 ) . Players online multiplayer game behave altruistically form friendship ( Wang Wang , 2008 ) . These positive emotional effect may enhance cognitive rehabilitation , cognitive emotional side rehabilitation connect ( Mateer , 2005 ) . The hypothesis thus : play multiplayer online game useful form cognitive rehabilitation brain-injured people . This research identify whether multi-player online video game may use complementary therapeutic tool .

	<detailed_description>Purpose design This research aim find massively multi-player online game ( MMOs ) , relatively new type video game , use form therapy people survive acquired brain injury . Numerous previous study show video game use therapy many context . However , evidence video game effective form cognitive rehabilitation brain injury survivor ( Malec et al. , 1984 ) . The difference research MMOs incorporate social interaction game play experience . It propose strengthen social bond beneficial similar single-player game . Due narrow focus research anticipate number potential participant small , order ten participant . It recognise small sample size compatible randomise control trial . Instead , research employ single-subject research design , high number participant strengthen external validity result . The research question design develop primarily Chief Investigator ( PhD student ) , critique supervisory team . Feedback also receive healthcare professional contact C.I . Participants ask feedback video game user interface . This ensure video game suitable participant , participant able play . This stage expect consist three four session 30 min duration , every 2 week . Participants ask play video game number session . The number session 21 . The duration session one hour . The session hold per week . Null/alternative hypotheses The null hypotheses single-player video game improve cognitive skill ; multi-player online video game improve cognitive skill . The alternative hypothesis single-player game improve cognitive skill , multi-player online game provide improvement . Study design The first stage research design refine prototype online multi-player video game , work collaboration participant , firstly able-bodied , disabled . The researcher work participant develop user interface enables play video game . The study employ single-case research design disable participant . An RCT would valid give expected number participant . Time-series data collect three phase : obtain baseline ; measure effect single-player video game ; measure effect multi-player online game . Each phase seven session . The session one hour , weekly . During baseline phase , The participant engage non-game task use interface define pre-trial phase . This phase may compensate researcher effect . For next phase , participant engage single-player version video game . For final phase , participant engage multi-player online game . Player activity single- multi-player game log analysis . Interviews participant use build thick narrative participant ' experience course study . Recruitment Participants recruit contact head injury unit , day care centre , organisation Headway ARNI Trust . The C.I . meet potential participant express interest study . A cornerstone rehabilitation goal relevant client 's everyday life . Therefore detail individual 's cognitive improvement measure must base dialogue individual . Consent Informed consent must give participant involvement study . A participant information sheet provide . The C.I . present talk issue participant . The NHS guideline write clear information sheet follow . Due nature participant ' injury , particular care emphasis place establish capacity give consent . The Department Health give guideline gauge capacity family member care worker key source guidance . It expect participant provide write signature consent form , due nature participant 's injury may possible . In case verbal consent participant would record witness ( e ) would sign form . Risks , burden benefit The main medical risk play video game possibility epileptic seizure due photosensitive epilepsy , ( PSE ) . Minor risk : possibility ache pain ; eye strain ; stress cause extend period vigilance . These risk mitigate conduct research day care centre medical staff hand , limit play one hour per week , break small play session ( e.g . 3 * 20 min ) . Additionally , minimise risk photosensitive seizure , screen luminance keep minimum . Other issue consider use video game therapy : video game `` addiction '' ; violent content ; offensive nature game . The issue potential addiction mitigate short playing time ; issue game suitability manage preview discuss game content participant , family member carers appropriate . Potential benefit participant : Playing suitable game provide feeling well-being improve self esteem . With added social aspect multi-player online game , participant could also feel less isolated . These improvement emotional health may beneficial effect cognitive skill communication . Confidentiality Participant personal detail keep confidential . When data report , random numeric IDs use refer individual . Guidelines issue Office National Statistics follow tabulate data contains cell zero extremely low number , potential identification participant prevent .</detailed_description>
