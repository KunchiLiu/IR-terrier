	<brief_title>Impact FeNO Measured With NIOX MINO® Device Identifying Asthma Among Patients With Prolonged Respiratory Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Overview : The measurement exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) clinical test measure airway inflammation perform consistently accurately clinical practice point-of-care . Airway inflammation recognize central mechanism pathogenesis asthma symptom . The measurement FeNO NIOX MINO® device provide rapid , noninvasive , inexpensive tool ass airway inflammation asthma . The test easy perform require minimal training operator conduct test . Burden Disease : The burden asthma U.S. significant grow . In May 2011 , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report prevalence asthma increase 12.3 % 2001 2009 affect approximately 24.6 million Americans , include 9.6 % pediatric population . In 2008 , least one half ( 52.6 % ) person asthma U.S. report asthma attack precede 12 month . In 2007 , 1.75 million asthma-related emergency department visit 456,000 asthma hospitalization . Initial assessment diagnosis asthma ongoing management asthma patient remain key challenge . The traditional approach diagnose management asthma include family history evaluation , symptom assessment airflow measure ( e.g . spirometry ) . However , approach effectively incorporate measurement inflammation diagnosis management approach . Role Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) : FeNO evolve predictive prognostic biomarker airway inflammation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas produce epithelial cell bronchial wall intrinsic part inflammatory process . Measuring amount FeNO useful initial assessment patient chronic cough symptom suggestive asthma , management patient corticosteroid treatment . Exhaled nitric oxide increase eosinophilic airway inflammation . Changes FeNO precede change symptoms observe increase decreased airway inflammation . The measurement FeNO easily rapidly accomplish , provide objective , interpretable value influence patient effort variation clinician 's test technique . FeNO measurement well-established scientifically document procedure 2000 publication use . Intended Use : NIOX MINO® measure Nitric Oxide ( NO ) human breath . Nitric Oxide frequently increase inflammatory process asthma . The fractional NO concentration expire breath ( FeNO ) , measure NIOX MINO assurance measurement repeatable accord guideline NO measurement establish American Thoracic Society . Measurement FeNO NIOX MINO quantitative , non-invasive , simple safe method measure decrease FeNO concentration asthma patient often occur treatment anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy , indication therapeutic effect patient elevate FeNO level . NIOX MINO suitable child , approximately 7 - 17 year , adults 18 year old . Rationale Study : The current study generate information characterize patient seek health care Primary Care Clinic present non-specific low respiratory symptom cough , wheeze , and/or shortness breath associate asthma may label acute respiratory condition , e.g . infection . Results study may use estimate number patient required demonstrate meaningful change non-specific low respiratory symptom future study may also support usefulness FeNO Primary Care set . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES : Overall Aim : To good understand diagnostic process prolong respiratory event determine potential role FeNO assess possibility asthma symptom etiology . Study Objectives : The specific objective study : - Determine frequency ICS prescription treatment non-specific low respiratory symptom . - Determine frequency asthma diagnosis etiology non-specific low respiratory symptom . - Explore value FeNO identify asthma etiology non-specific low respiratory symptom . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN : Overall Clinical Investigation Design Plan-Description : An observational , multicenter , single-visit study collect information patient utilize Primary Care Clinic seek health care assessment , treatment , management non-specific low respiratory symptom cough , wheeze , and/or shortness breath . All patient seek care clinic medical condition ask complete brief screen questionnaire design capture self-assessment non-specific low respiratory symptom . Patients non-specific low respiratory symptom cough , wheeze , and/or shortness breath meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study may invite participate study . Visit Procedures : Subjects meet Inclusion Exclusion Criteria express interest study participation ask provide follow documentation information : Informed Consent/Assent ; Baseline Characteristics ; Medical History FeNO Measurement : A single blind FeNO measurement obtain . Patient Discharge Study : Once information collect procedure perform , patient discharge clinic study participation complete . Medical Record Review : Patient 's medical record administrative data review study close-out ass number previous similar episode patient previous two ( 2 ) year . Selection Population : Population Characteristics : Males female , seven ( 7 ) 65 year age . It anticipate approximately 3,000 patient multiple primary care clinic complete brief screen questionnaire use identify approximately 280 eligible patient meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion ( approximately ) 4 6 week study enrollment period . Medical Device : The NIOX MINO® clear FDA March 4 , 2008 new hand-held device measurement exhale Nitric Oxide , marker eosinophilic airway inflammation . The NIOX MINO® 10 second test base exhale breath measure 50 ml/second flow rate . In study result display , remain blinded investigator . PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT : Clinical performance assessment : Investigators use judgment determine study candidate able successfully perform assessment FeNO use NIOX MINO® . Clinical safety assessment : The Investigator responsible detection , reporting , documentation event meet definition Adverse Event ( AE ) and/or Serious Injury provide clinical investigation plan time informed consent/assent study period . Adverse event : - Adverse event : Any incident use medical device ( include vitro diagnostics ) suspect resulted adverse outcome patient . - Serious injury : mean injury illness : 1 . Is life-threatening , 2 . Results permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure , 3 . Necessitates medical surgical intervention preclude permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure . - Malfunction : failure device meet performance specification otherwise perform intend . - Caused contributed : death serious injury may attribute medical device , medical device may factor death serious injury , include event occur result : 1 . Failure 2 . Malfunction 3 . Improper inadequate design 4 . Manufacture 5 . Labeling 6 . User error</detailed_description>
