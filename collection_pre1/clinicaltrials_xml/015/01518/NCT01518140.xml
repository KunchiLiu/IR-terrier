	<detailed_description>Device A design get air lung without use much effort regular breathing . The air give mask , amount air set different level . Device B design deliver air lung . The air warm , filter bacteria , deliver nose use tube nostril . Device C design deliver air lung . The air give mask , amount air set different level . Study Groups Device Use : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 group : - If Group 1 , receive air Device A 1 hour , `` need '' basis 4 hour . Then receive air Device B 30 minute , follow 30 minute use Device C. - If Group 2 , receive air Device B 1 hour , need basis 4 hour . Then receive air Device A 30 minute , follow 30 minute use Device C. - If Group 3 , receive air Device C 1 hour , need basis 4 hour . Then receive air Device A 30 minute , follow 30 minute use Device B . The study staff help use device . The maximum time allow use 3 device 6 hour total . During `` need '' use period ( 4 hour ) , switch device assign air delivery device oxygen level use start study . Study Visit : During study visit , follow test procedure perform : - From medical record , study staff collect information age , sex , race , disease type , well able perform normal activity daily live , drug take , possible cause shortness breath . - You complete 2 questionnaire . The first ask breathing symptom , second asks symptom may . It take 15 minute complete questionnaire . - Your heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure record . - The level air breathe record use measure device chest . - Before use device , ask hard catch breath side effect may . - At end visit , fill questionnaire asks device prefer . It take 5 minute complete questionnaire . Length Study : You study 6 hour . You take study device stop intolerable side effect occur use study device . This investigational study . The 3 breathing device commercially available FDA approve deliver oxygen medically need , include cancer patient . It investigational collect information patient rate well study device may affect shortness breath . Up 90 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
