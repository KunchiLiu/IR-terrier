	<brief_summary>Prognosis many carcinoma , include ovarian carcinoma , dependent complete surgical resection , also know R0 resection . At present , ability perform complete resection negative margin limit surgeon 's ability palpate visualize tumor margin . Therefore , order reduce operative morbidity cost maintain improve surgical oncologic outcome , investigator must develop technology improve visualization primary tumor occult metastasis , real time , surgery . Recent research demonstrate use fluorescent probe recognize cancer specific antigen use purpose visualized use prototype near-infrared multispectral imaging system . This investigation determine folate-FITC , fluorescent probe recognize folate receptor ( present &gt; 90 % ovarian cancer ) facilitate surgical resection detect tumor nodule visible naked eye .</brief_summary>
