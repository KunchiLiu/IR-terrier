	<brief_summary>Background : - The body produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) every 2 hour . GnRH travel bloodstream pituitary gland , stimulates gland produce hormone call gonadotropin . These hormone stimulate testicle ovary . The testicle produce testosterone develop sperm . The ovary produce estrogen prepare ovulation . Normal estrogen testosterone level require puberty . Some people , however , either low level total lack GnRH . This cause problem puberty fertility . Researchers want study people low GnRH good understand affect puberty fertility . Objectives : - To study disorder GnRH production . Eligibility : - Adult men woman least 18 year age low gonadotropin level . - Adolescents 14 18 year age low gonadotropin level . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants test look hormone level . Blood sample may collect take different drug , include insulin cortisone . A 24-hour urine sample collect . - Participants image study look bone brain development . They also ultrasounds kidney , abdomen , reproductive organ . - Tests smell hear use look abnormalities sens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The key initiating factor reproductive development remain among great mystery pediatric reproductive endocrinology . The onset puberty initiate pulsatile secretion gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) hypothalamus . GnRH secretion fully active neonatal period , quiescent throughout childhood , reactivate time puberty induce sexual maturation subsequent fertility . The neuroendocrine event lead increase GnRH secretion resultant onset puberty remain largely unknown . Isolated deficiency GnRH result rare clinical syndrome idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( IHH ) , decrease secretion GnRH result impair gonadotropin secretion . The resultant hypogonadism present delay , incomplete , absent sexual maturation . In addition , non-reproductive phenotype spectrum identify individual , include anosmia , auditory defect , skeletal renal anomaly . Defining physiology GnRH critical understanding clinical heterogeneity isolate GnRH deficiency , particularly light emerge gene discovery elucidate genotype-phenotype correlation . Careful human phenotyping patient mutation gene know cause IHH provide insight developmental pathway involve ontogeny GnRH neuron , neuroendocrine regulation system well understood . Here , propose addition NIH second site exist protocol Massachusetts General Hospital phenotypically characterize subject IHH . We plan admit male females 14 year age old clinical sign suggestive IHH comprehensive phenotyping include neuroendocrine profile via LH pulsatility study , well identification non-reproductive finding . Combining effort establish protocol recruitment mechanism MGH allow u maximize number subject rare disorder evaluate . This protocol utilize disease model IHH increase understand physiology GnRH secretion , include neuroendocrine regulation GnRH pulsatility , well unknown aspect GnRH biology , may illuminate non-reproductive characteristic patient . Examining baseline characteristic subject isolate GnRH deficiency reveal insight mechanisms underlie reawaken hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis puberty , provide opportunity new diagnostic capability therapeutic intervention disorder puberty fertility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism rare condition , incidence 1/10,000 1/86,000 isolated GnRH deficiency ( 34 , 35 ) , protocol remain open enrollment may study subject qualify interested participating . Males female great equal 14 year old clinical finding HH outline include . In certain circumstance , patient age 14 year may consider baseline evaluation sufficient evidence suggestive HH , two following : anosmia , history cryptorchidism microphallus . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because HH represent spectrum , associate clinical finding may provide phenotypic clue assessment inheritability underlie physiology , exclusion criterion limit : Patients additional pituitary deficiency , effectively rule isolate GnRH deficiency , whether deficiency congenital acquire ( e.g . secondary malignancy , infection , irradiation ) . Patients take medication know cause HH , corticosteroids continuous opiate administration . Pregnancy lactation</criteria>
