	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All Participants must : Be age 1855 . Be righthanded . Assessment tool ( ) : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Be good health . Justification : Many illness may alter fMRI signal well cognitive process neural functioning . Assessment tool ( ) : Participants provide brief health history phone screening , undergo medical history physical examination qualify IRP clinician . Be free active DSMIV dependence , dependence partial remission , alcohol drug except nicotine . Past active dependence acceptable provide least five year past total time active dependence exceed 4 year . Those past dependence substance alcohol marijuana may current use ( past 6 month ) substance dependent . For individual past alcohol marijuana dependence , current use previously dependent substance allow provide meet current DSMIV criterion substance dependence , exception tolerance . Justification : Dependence substance ( drug alcohol ) may result unique CNS deficit could confound result introduce excessive variance . Assessment tool ( ) : The computerized SCID clinical substance abuse/dependence assessment . While recreational/intermittent use alcohol and/or marijuana tolerate participant group , individual exclude meet current recent ( within 5 year ) DSMIV diagnostic criterion dependence substance . A positive drug test marijuana exclusionary long participant use 24hrs precede image visit . In event positive drug test marijuana , selfreports current marijuana use use differentiate intermittent/infrequent chronic/frequent user . Given possible link marijuana use psychosis ( Ben Amar Potvin , 2007 ) frequent user , define use twice per week within last month , exclude participation . Be able abstain alcohol 24hrs imaging session able moderate caffeine intake 12hrs session . Justification : Alcohol caffeine modulate neural functioning way would complicate data interpretation . Assessment tool ( ) : Selfreport breathalyzer . Must urine cotinine ( NicAlert ) level 4 high smoking consistently least one year . For light smoker ( less 10 cpd ) , define smoke current level least past year ( exclude quit attempt last year ) . For heavy smoker ( 10 cpd ) , must smoke least average 10 cpd least past year ( exclude quit attempt ) . Be able abstain smoke 36hrs two occasion study . Justification : The present protocol investigate effect acute nicotine withdrawal affective , inhibitory control decision making process neurobiological correlate . Previous research suggest 36hrs deprivation period appropriate produce robust effect across domain ( Kozink et al. , 2010a ; McClernon et al. , 2009b ; VanderVeen , Cohen , Cukrowicz , &amp; Trotter , 2008 ) . To isolate effect nicotinewithdrawal ( oppose tobacco withdrawal ) , participant require abstain smoke prior scan session . They deliver nicotine one abstinence period ( nondeprived ) via dosematched transdermal patch , wear placebo patch abstinence period ( nicotinedeprived ) . Assessment tool ( ) : video record measurement expire CO level plasma nicotine level . Agree also participate NIDAIRP protocol 10DAN457 . Treatmentseeking smoker also meet follow inclusion criterion : Be actively seek treatment smoke cessation willing engage 12weeks treatment involve daily administration Varenicline weekly counseling session , well followup assessment 1 , 6 12 month follow treatment onset . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant exclude : suitable undergo fMRI experiment due certain implanted device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) , body morphology , claustrophobia . Justification : MR scan one primary measurement tool use protocol . Assessment tool ( ) : Prospective participant fill MRI screen questionnaire undergo interview MR technologist . Questions concern suitability scanning refer MR Medical Safety Officer . Prospective participant question symptom claustrophobia place mock scanner first visit ass possible difficulty tolerate confinement scanner ability fit scanner . coagulopathies , history , current superficial , deep vein thrombosis , musculoskeletal abnormality restrict individual ability lie flat extend period time . Justification : MR scan session require participant lie flat back remain perfectly still approximately two hour . Therefore , condition would make difficult ( e.g . chronic back pain , significant scoliosis ) dangerous ( e.g . familial hypercoagulability syndrome , history thrombosis ) exclusionary . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , supplement trial lie mock scanner assess comfort issue . HIV Syphilis . Justification : HIV Syphilis central nervous system ( CNS ) sequela , thus introduce unnecessary variability data . Assessment tool ( ) : Oral HIV follow blood test oral test + STS+ without adequate prior treatment regularly use prescription ( e.g. , antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , barbiturate ) , overthecounter ( e.g. , cold medicine ) herbal medication ( e.g. , Kava , Gingko biloba , St. John wort ) may alter CNS function , cardiovascular function , neuronalvascular coupling . Justification : The use substance may alter fMRI signal and/or neural function interest current study . Assessment tool ( ) : History comprehensive urine drug screen detect antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , barbiturate . current neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , frequent migraine prophylaxis , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history significant head trauma , CNS tumor . Justification : Neurological disease alter CNS function , possibly , neuronalvascular coupling form basis fMRI signal . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , urine drug screening anticonvulsant disclose history . History head trauma loss consciousness 30 minute postconcussive sequelae last two day , regardless loss consciousness , exclusionary . The MAI also retain discretion exclude base history neurological illness may compromise data integrity . current major psychiatric disorder include , limited , mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder , current suicidal ideation history suicide attempt currently antidepressant antipsychotic medication treatment . The MAI reserve right exclude basis psychiatric history explicitly describe criterion Justification : Psychiatric disorder involve central neural system ( CNS ) , therefore , expect alter fMRI measure use study . A recent FDA communication ( 2/1/2008 ) indicate may association varenicline worsen current psychiatric illness even illness currently control . Assessment tool ( ) : Computerized SCID , Beck Depression Inventory , Beck Anxiety Inventory , Adult ADHD SelfReport Scales clinical interview confirmation clinician . cognitively impaired learning disable . Justification : Cognitive impairment learn disability may associate alter brain functioning region recruit laboratory task performance . Cognitive impairment may affect one ability give inform consent . Assessment tool ( ) : History placement specialeducation class consequence serious learn problem solely consequence behavioral problem , assess History Physical screening assessment . significant cardiovascular cerebrovascular condition . Justification : Such condition may alter blood flow , fMRI signal autonomic signal , increase risk associated nicotine patch use . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical exam , include 12lead EKG . major medical condition view investigator would compromise safety individual participation . Justification : Many illness explicitly cover may increase risk alter important outcome measure . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician CBC , urinalysis , NIDA chemistry panel ( liver function test , electrolyte , kidney function ) . The following lab value result exclusion study : Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl White Blood Cell Count &lt; 2400/ ( micro ) l Liver Function Tests &gt; 3X normal Serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl Urine protein &gt; 2+ Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60ml/min The MAI retain discretion exclude base less extreme lab result . After screen process complete , MAI take account data collect order decide exist medical illness would compromise participation research . pregnant , plan become pregnant , breastfeed . Females instruct consent use effective form birth control study period . Justification : study procedure drug use current protocol may complicate pregnancy transfer nursing child . Assessment tool ( ) : Urine and/or serum pregnancy test , clinical interview . Urine pregnancy test conduct begin image visit . Treatmentseeking smoker also exclude : moderate severe renal impairment . Justification . Given renal secretion varenicline major route clearance , kidney impairment may result high systemic level drug intend . Per Pfizer chantix insert , varenicline pharmacokinetics unchanged subject mild renal impairment comparison normal renal function , whereas individual moderate severe impairment present varenicline level 1.5 2.1fold high , respectively . Assessment tool ( ) : Estimated glomerular filtration rate . Renal insufficiency estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min calculate CockcroftGault equation exclude . diabetic . Justification . A recent case report describe multiple episode severe hypoglycemia experience 51 year old TypeI diabetic begin varenicline treatment ( Kristensen et al. , 2008 ) . The discontinuation varenicline resolve hypoglycemic episode . The safety varenicline investigate patient diabetes . Assessment tool ( ) : Casual plasma glucose testing . Individuals glucose level 200 mg/dl may evaluate diabetes use fast glucose test exclude .</criteria>
