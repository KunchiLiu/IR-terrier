	<brief_summary>The investigator study whether , young child acute otitis medium ( AOM ) , shorten length antibiotic treatment strategy reduce antimicrobial resistance provide satisfactory clinical outcome . This Phase 2b multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial 600 child age 6 23 month compare efficacy consistent reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment ( 5 day ) consistent standard-duration treatment ( 10 day ) episode AOM develop single respiratory season ( October 1 May 31 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Short-Course Antimicrobial Treatment Children With Acute Otitis Media Impact Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject randomize enrollment visit telephone call course therapy , subsequent visit end therapy . Thereafter , follow end respiratory season , parent encourage bring child concern potential recurrence AOM . At recurrence subject receive treatment regimen ( either standard- reduced-duration ) randomize study entry ( consistent treatment strategy ) . The recruitment eligible child AOM vary degree severity various primary care practice 2 separate geographic region , i.e . Western Pennsylvania Kentucky , represent urban , suburban rural demographic enhance generalizability study finding encourage translation clinical practice .</detailed_description>

Inpatient hospitalization 3 . Clinical anatomical characteristic might obscure response treatment ( tympanostomy tube place , cleft palate , Down syndrome ) 4 . Sensorineural hearing loss ( unilateral bilateral ) 5 . Serious underlie systemic problem might obscure response infection ( cystic fibrosis , neoplasm , juvenile diabetes ) 6 . Concomitant infection would preclude evaluation response child 's AOM study product ( pneumonia , periorbital cellulitis ) 7 . Acute wheeze exacerbation may require treatment systemic corticosteroid 8 . Known renal hepatic dysfunction insufficiency 9 . History amoxicillinclavulanateassociated cholestatic jaundice 10 . Immune dysfunction receipt immunosuppressive therapy ; chronic gastrointestinal condition ( i.e. , malabsorption , inflammatory bowel disease ) 11 .
