	<brief_title>An Active Surveillance Program Cases Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This active surveillance program monitor signal indicating possible association treatment long-acting GLP-1 RAs development MTC United States population . Given low incidence MTC general population , expect rate exposure long-acting GLP-1 RAs , anticipate long latency potential outcome study limit data underlie risk factor development MTC RET proto-oncogene mutation , active surveillance program efficient mean identify possible association MTC product long-acting GLP-1 RAs class . Given uncertainty association MTC human treat drug , study duration least fifteen year time market introduction first long-acting GLP-1 RA think provide evidence association , one exist . If association identify , case-control study initiate quantify association . The MTC registry Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) post-marketing requirement long-acting GLP-1 RA product . Because rarity MTC order minimize inconvenience patient , physician , state cancer registry , FDA encourage sponsor long-acting GLP-1 RAs work collaboratively conduct registry . Consequently , MTC Registry Consortium form purpose . The MTC Registry Consortium refer Sponsors approve long-acting GLP-1 RAs contractual agreement participate MTC Registry . This active surveillance program case MTC conduct assistance North American Association Central Cancer Registries ( NAACCR ) . NAACCR collaborative umbrella organization cancer registry , government agency , professional organization , private group North America interested improve quality use cancer registry data . All central cancer registry U.S. Canada member NAACCR , include participate SEER .</detailed_description>
