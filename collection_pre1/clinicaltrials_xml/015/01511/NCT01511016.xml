	<brief_summary>`` HIV lipodystrophy syndrome '' ( HLS ) characterize loss fat arm leg , increase fat abdomen , abnormal blood lipid level . Persons HLS high risk cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome . The investigator previously show abnormal lipid level lipodystrophy HLS associate defective regulation lipid metabolic rate , specifically , accelerate lipolysis ( breakdown store fat ) , decrease fat oxidation ( utilization fat energy ) . Patients HLS also low level hormone leptin . The investigator hypothesize treatment patient leptin improve fat oxidation may slow rate lipolysis . Hence , investigator propose study effect leptin therapy lipid metabolic rate lipid glucose level adult HLS . The investigator use state art stable isotope tracer technique gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GCMS ) measure lipolysis , fat oxidation , fat re-esterification adipose tissue liver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HIV lipodystrophy syndrome ( HLS ) characterize peripheral fat waste central obesity , hyperlipidemia ( mainly hypertriglyceridemia ) , result insulin resistance . HLS patient high risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome . The investigator previously show alteration lipid metabolism so-called mixed form HLS due dysregulation lipid kinetics two level . First , appear acceleration lipid kinetics , high total net lipolysis despite high intra-adipocyte re-esterification . However , percentage fatty acid flux oxidize remains , lead increase hepatic recycle fatty acid triglyceride ( TG ) , export TG-rich VLDL circulation . Second , reduce clearance chylomicron VLDL-TG plasma , result strike hypertriglyceridemia associate syndrome . The investigator propose alteration lipid kinetics account phenotypic change characteristic syndrome : increase lipolysis would facilitate peripheral lipoatrophy , increase intra-adipocyte re-esterification ( selective intrabdominal depot ) would contribute central obesity , increase hepatic re-esterification together impaired VLDL- chylomicron-TG clearance would lead hypertriglyceridemia . Rational treatment HLS target fundamental kinetic defect . Leptin many way ideal agent , since increase fat oxidation , shift ratio utilization free fatty acid derive lipolysis towards oxidation away re-esterification , decrease plasma triglyceride level . HLS patient lipoatrophy low circulating level leptin . Moreover , leptin show effective correcting similar defect fat redistribution circulate lipid non-HIV form lipodystrophy . Hence , investigator propose study ( use blind , placebo-controlled , dose escalate design ) effect leptin therapy lipid kinetics fat distribution adult subject lipoatrophic mixed ( peripheral lipoatrophy central adiposity ) form HLS . The investigator use state art stable isotope tracer technique gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GCMS ) measure whole body lipolysis , lipid oxidation , lipid re-esterification hepatic lipid recycling .</detailed_description>
