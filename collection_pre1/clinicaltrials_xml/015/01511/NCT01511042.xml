	<brief_summary>The investigator excite National Institutes Health sponsor u investigate patient diabetes likely develop high blood pressure , atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) , heart disease . There two part research program . The first part screen visit . At visit give brief physical exam ask question concern medical history . During visit blood drawn routine screening prepare DNA genetic testing . You also ask collect urine sample routine screening . If doctor find healthy candidate invite participate second part study . During Phase II investigator perform physiologic test place low salt diet place high salt diet . All food eat two diet provide hospital . If blood pressure medication , may necessary discontinue take present medication three month begin study . Patients discontinue current blood pressure medication may place different blood pressure medication washout period necessary maintain blood pressure pre-study level . The investigator take medication , except cholesterol medication two week prior schedule in-patient study . However , currently medication control diabetes remain throughout entire study . Once blood pressure medication discontinue , closely monitored make sure encounter difficulty . If home blood pressure monitor , investigator provide one use study keep daily record blood pressure reading . The investigator ask call u every three day report blood pressure reading . Less 20 % patient hypertension significant increase blood pressure short time therapy . After medication nine day dietician give low salt meal eat home six day . On sixth day low salt diet , ask begin 24-hour urine collection . You also require come Ambulatory Clinical Center ( 221 Longwood Ave. ) one-hour test . You return even inpatient Clinical Research Center admit first study occur next morning . On morning low salt study three naturally occur hormone administer blood sample draw intravenous needle . The investigator also take ultrasound picture heart see salt hormone affect way heart function . These test last approximately five hour discharge around 12:00 p.m . The dietician give meal next week take home . Each meal high salt content . After six day high salt diet , morning second admission hospital , ask begin final 24-hour urine collection . The study do low salt study repeat high salt study . You discharge around 3:00 p.m . This study determine salt-sensitive . A high salt diet find lead high blood pressure weight gain . In addition , investigator hope learn hormone regulate blood pressure gene responsible regulate hormone . You place back initial blood pressure medication ( ) return regular physician care .
