	<brief_title>Safety Trial Live Attenuated Influenza ( H7N3 ) Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , double-blind , individually-randomized ( 3:1 , vaccine : placebo ) , control trial two group , LAIV H7N3 match placebo . Healthy male female adult 18 49 year age invite participate . For feasibility reason order independent Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) review safety data small group subject initially , total cohort 40 subject enrol two sub-cohorts : one cohort 12 subject , randomize 3:1 ( 9 vaccine 3 placebo ) , follow two week later second cohort 28 subject randomize 3:1 ( 21 vaccine 7 placebo ) . After 12 volunteer first sub-cohort observe first isolation period ( Day 1 Day 7 ) , interim safety review perform SMC . The SMC review AEs , include clinical laboratory evaluation ( pre- post-vaccination ) shed data , subject advise volunteer first sub-cohort may receive dose two study vaccine placebo additional 28 volunteer second sub-cohort may enrol study . As first sub-cohort , SMC also review safety data second sub-cohort entire participant population trial . For sub-cohort , procedure timeline summarize . On day first screen , 7 day ( 4 14 day ) prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo , subject screen eligibility medical history review , physical examination , test serologic evidence chronic viral infection [ human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , proper pre- post-test counseling ] , routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick . Subject screen eligibility continue complete second screening day ( S2 ) . This second screening day occur day schedule admission isolation unit administration study vaccine placebo ( Day 0 ) . Women undergo pregnancy test use urine sample . All subject undergo ear , nose throat ( ENT ) examination . Fully eligible subject admit isolation unit . At time , nasal swab , nasal wick , blood specimen collect virologic immunological test prior administration study vaccine placebo . Blood urine specimen collect routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick ; result serve define baseline status subject prior receipt study vaccine placebo use screening purpose . Subjects unaware allocation , LAIV H7N3 match placebo , receive ; study vaccine placebo mask . Subjects carefully monitor adverse reaction isolation unit . All subject remain isolation unit least 7 day receipt study vaccine placebo . Nasal swabs collect daily subject isolation test presence influenza virus shed nasal passage . Any subject exhibiting conjunctivitis also conjunctival swab collect day appearance sign . Any subject exhibiting influenza A virus shed , determine real-time RT-PCR positivity nasal swab specimen , 2 day prior plan discharge day dose ( Days 6 7 Days 34 35 ) keep isolation PCR-diagnosis result confirm influenza virus present test clinical specimen least two consecutive day . Any subject still exhibit evidence influenza virus shed nasal swab Days 6 7 Days 34 35 post-administration dose might place influenza antiviral ( oseltamivir ) treatment standard dose treatment 75 milligram ( mg ) twice day course 5 day . After discharge isolation unit , subject complete diary card AEs use concomitant medication . Subjects return isolation unit four week ( Day 28 ) administration dose one study vaccine placebo . At time , similar procedure use admittance isolation unit , receipt dose two study vaccine placebo isolation follow-up , additional procedure review interim history ( diary card ) since first discharge dose one . After second discharge isolation unit , subject complete diary card AEs use concomitant medication . Subjects return study center four week ( Day 56 ) administration dose two study vaccine placebo final study visit . Interim history ( diary card ) review final blood nasal wick specimen collect . Women also undergo final pregnancy screen . Subjects complete study time . For assessment safety , subject observe two hour administration study vaccine placebo . Twice daily ( early morning late afternoon ) examination also use assess reaction 7 day administration study vaccine placebo . ENT examination also occur per day Days 7 , 28 , 35 56 . Subjects complete diary card unsolicited AEs day discharge return isolation unit dose two ( Day 28 ) return study center final study visit four week post dose two ( Day 56 ) . To assess safety , blood urine specimen also collect day 7 , 28 ( prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo ) , 35 56 , test routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick . For evaluation mucosal IgA antibody , nasal wick specimen collect Day 0 ( prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo ) , Day 28 ( prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo ) Day 56 . For evaluation serum antibody ( HAI , microneutralization IgA IgG EIA ) , serum specimen collect Day 0 ( prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo ) , Day 28 ( prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo ) Day 56 . To study virus infectivity ( isolation chicken embryo ) stability ( molecular sequencing isolated virus ) , nasal swab specimen take Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 29 , 31 . To assess prim stimulation cytotoxic T lymphocytes cytokine indicator , whole blood isolation PBMCs collect Days 0 ( prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo ) , Day 28 ( prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo ) Day 56 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Legal male female adult 18 49 year age enrollment visit . Literate willing provide write informed consent . Free obvious health problem , establish medical history screening evaluation , include physical examination . Capable willing complete diary card willing return followup visit Willing comply rule isolation unit ( include willing able take oseltamivir influenza antiviral medication , recommend study physician ) . For female , willing take reliable birth control measure throughout entire period participation study . Participation another clinical trial involve therapy within previous three month plan enrollment trial period study . Receipt nonstudy vaccine within four week prior enrollment refusal postpone receipt vaccine four week study completion . Practice nasal irrigation regular basis within past six month engage nasal irrigation within two week prior enrollment . Recent history frequent nose bleeds ( &gt; 5 within past year ) . Clinically relevant abnormal paranasal anatomy . Recent history ( within past month ) rhino sinus surgery , surgery traumatic injury nose . Current recent ( within two week enrollment ) acute respiratory illness without fever . Other acute illness time study enrollment . Receipt immune globulin blood product within three month prior study enrollment plan receipt product period subject participation study . Chronic administration ( define 14 consecutivelyprescribed day ) immunosuppressant immunemodulating therapy within six month prior study enrollment . ( For corticosteroid , mean prednisone equivalent , &gt; =0.5 mg per kg per day ; topical steroid allow , exclusive nasal . ) Participation previous trial H5 H7 contain influenza vaccine . History asthma . Hypersensitivity previous administration influenza vaccine . History wheeze past receipt live influenza vaccine . Other AE follow immunization , least possibly relate previous receipt influenza vaccine . Suspected known hypersensitivity study vaccine component , include chicken egg protein . Seasonal ( autumnal ) hypersensitivity natural environment . Acute chronic clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic , metabolic , neurologic , psychiatric renal functional abnormality , determine medical history , physical examination clinical laboratory screening test , opinion investigator , might interfere study objective . Subjects physical examination finding clinical laboratory screening result would grade 2 high AE severity grade scale exclude entry study exclude receipt dose two study vaccine placebo . History leukemia blood solid organ cancer . History thrombocytopenic purpura know bleed disorder . History seizure . Known suspect immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition kind , include HIV infection . Known chronic HBV HCV infection . Known tuberculosis infection evidence previous tuberculosis exposure . History chronic alcohol abuse and/or illegal drug use . Claustrophobia sociophobia . Pregnancy lactation . ( A negative pregnancy test require administration study vaccine placebo woman childbearing potential . ) Any condition , opinion investigator , would increase health risk subject he/she participates study would interfere evaluation study objective .</criteria>
