	<brief_summary>Extensively multi-drug resistant A. baumannii ( AB ) represent emerge threat hospital locally worldwide . There lack prospective comparative clinical data guide optimal strategy treat infection . Since remains unclear treat bacteremia cause AB , present study aim enroll patient multiple site extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter specie bacteremia receive different combination therapy ass treatment outcomes analyze risk factor associate mortality .</brief_summary>
