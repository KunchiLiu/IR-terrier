	<brief_summary>Physical inactivity overweight two accepted risk factor breast cancer . However , correlation clear relevant risk . The investigator set study whether physical activity addition weight loss diet , affect sex hormone level , know related breast cancer risk . In SHAPE-2 study 250 healthy overweight/obese physically inactive woman randomly allocate diet-induced weight loss group , combine exercise- diet-induced weight loss group control group . The aim first two intervention group loose 5-6 kg bodyweight , either diet mainly increased physical activity . Measurements perform baseline 21 week , end study period . The aim study provide insight effect weight loss mainly driven exercise compare equivalent weight loss due nutritional calorie restriction breast cancer biomarkers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Equivalent Weight Loss With Without Exercise Training Breast Cancer Risk ( SHAPE-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmenopausal woman sedentary overweight , increase breast cancer risk . It suggest two factor mediate breast cancer risk mainly sex hormone-related pathway . However , inactive lifestyle obesity highly correlate clear relevant risk . Literature show weight loss/ fat loss reduces postmenopausal sex hormone level , question additional beneficial effect hormone reach weight loss physical activity instead nutritional intervention . In three-armed , two-center intervention study , 250 sedentary postmenopausal woman age 50-69 year first enter run-in period 5 week . During period , participant get diet , adapted guideline healthy nutrition , meet energy expenditure maintain stable weight . After run-in phase randomly allocate ( 1 ) diet induced weight loss group , ( 2 ) combine exercise diet induce weight loss group ( 3 ) control group . Participants allocate dietgroup get calorie restrict diet -500 kCal/day , remain habitual exercise pattern . Participants combine group follow exercise programme ( combine endurance strength ) 4 hour sport per week average energy expenditure 350 kCal/day , less strict . And calorie restrict diet -250 kCal/day . The aim intervention group loose 5-6 kg body weight 14 week intervention period . Participants control group request retain baseline diet habitual exercise pattern . Primary study parameter measure baseline 21 week : serum concentration endogenous estrogen , endogenous androgen sex hormone bind globulin . Other study parameter include : body fat distribution , amount total abdominal fat , weight , BMI , physical fitness , blood pressure lifestyle factor . The aim study provide insight effect weight loss mainly driven exercise compare equivalent weight loss due nutritional calorie restriction breast cancer biomarkers . Furthermore , specifically interested whether weight loss mainly due physical exercise induces great amount fat loss ( total abdominal ) subsequently result favourable effect hormone compare equivalent diet-induced weight loss .</detailed_description>
