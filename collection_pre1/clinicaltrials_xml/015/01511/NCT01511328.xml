	<detailed_description>Primary HPV screen method high sensitivity cytology detection high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , precursor cervical cancer . In particular , HPV test well test reveal adenocarcinoma , since cancer often show normal cytology . Cervical cancer screen age 60 : Cytology less effective old woman , screen cytology woman 60 documented effect . Today large part cervical cancer develop woman old 60 , screen offer . The prevalence HPV around 4 % age group . Since know test negative HPV give good long-term protection cervical cancer compare cytology , primary screen HPV 60-year old woman would give long last protection high-risk group compare today . Cervical cancer screen age 30-40 : HPV screen cost effective 35 year age . The reason HPV le prevalent age 35 young woman also cervical cancer seldom develop age . Since HPV test negative predictive value ( NPV ) almost 100 % could lead long screen interval , would improve cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
