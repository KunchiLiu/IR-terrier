	<brief_summary>The need certain component food ( i.e . protein ) critically ill child clear . It important critically ill child feed adequately prevent condition become bad recovery take longer . Research method use past investigate need protein ( Nitrogen Balance calculation ) , sensitive enough severely ill child . The purpose study develop new research method determine need protein severely ill child . In order develop new method , information need way body child use protein 24-hours . In present study 24-hours 8 child age less 18 year admit either Pediatric ICU Cardiovascular ICU . Subjects receive standard nutrition , provide age specific amount protein ( age ≤ 3 : 2.52 protein g/kg BW.d ; age 4-6 : 1.8 protein g/kg BW.d ; age &gt; 10 : 1.44 protein g/kg BW.d ) via tube feed . They also receive mixture stable isotope amino investigate protein behavior body ( protein kinetics ) infusion blood together nutrition . Blood drawn every 60 minute 24-hour period behavior protein concentration blood amino acid urea measure . Urine collect measure nitrogen balance . The investigator compare result nitrogen balance method result stable isotope method . PIM2 , PRISM , SIRS criterion use get information severity illness subject . Also body weight length well body composition subject measure start 24-hour period . Body composition measure Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy . Endpoints study net whole-body protein synthesis ( protein balance ) , 24-hour pattern protein balance , 24-hour urea production , 24-hour nitrogen balance , 24-hour contribution arginine kinetics whole body protein breakdown , 24-hour muscle protein breakdown , splanchnic amino acid extraction plasma amino acid concentration .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Critically ill child age less 18 year time enrollment 2 . Admitted Pediatric ICU Cardiovascular ICU , expect stay &gt; 72 hour 3 . One arterial line ( umbilical arterial line ) one multilumen central venous line ( two peripheral venous catheter ) place . 4 . Continuous total parenteral nutrition continuous enteral feeding ( e.g . via nasogastric , nasoduodenal , gastric , jejunal tube ) standard nutrition appropriate age weight expect admission . 5 . No planned major change intervention ( surgery ) treatment care patient enrollment completion study period ( end 24hour stable isotope infusion protocol ) . 6 . Hemodynamic stable condition ( without continuous inotropic medication ) define ≤1 bolus volume resuscitation hypotension 24 hour . 7 . No significant loss plasma/blood wound drain , may influence result study , chylothorax . 8 . Informed consent parent ( ) LAR . 1 . Congenital/acquired metabolic endocrine disorder hepatic renal failure anuria oliguria . 2 . Gastrointestinal obstruction condition cause malabsorption . 3 . Active gastrointestinal bleeding . 4 . Fluid restriction ( &lt; 100 ml/kg BW.day ) make administration intravenous enteral stable isotope impossible . 5 . Any condition accord Principal Investigator study physician would interfere collect study sample ( example isolation due MRSA infection ) .</criteria>
