Phase III clinical study conduct Jintan City , Jiangsu Province May , 2006 . Trial result show vaccine good safety immunogenicity . Hualan Bio Influenza Vaccine obtain production approval ( China Drug Approval No . : S20083016 ) marketing April 3rd , 2008 . In order monitor evaluate safety protective effect influenza administer age 3 old population , therefore conduct phase IV clinical trial license Influenza Vaccine ( split virion ) , Inactivated ( 15ug HA/subtype/0.5ml ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Select three site conduct study Henan , china . In principle informed consent voluntary participation , adopt randomize control design include 6000 healthy subject , among , trial group 3000 person , blank control group 3000 person respectively randomize divide 4 age group . The evaluation safety : For vaccinated subject , monitor general reaction post-vaccination AEFI mean active solicit passive report . The evaluation safety data mainly include summary clinical reaction endpoint , local systemic adverse event subject observation period incidence rate relevant ADR/AE . The evaluation immunogenicity : Respectively randomly sample 600 person vaccination group blank control group . Collect venous blood first day 28 day vaccination . Adopt international universal HI test method ( SRID ) carry serology test . The criterion HI antibody test result : - Take 1:10 serum low dilutability . For subject whose HI antibody &lt; 1:10 immunization , calculate 1:5 post-vaccination HI antibody titer≥1:40 seroconversion . For subject HI antibody ≥1:10 vaccination , take post-vaccination HI antibody titer increase 4 time seroconversion ; - Take HI antibody titer≥1:40 threshold positive protection ; - Take statistic subject number whose serum HI antibody titer reach protective level ( HI antibody titer≥1:40 ) . Calculate protection rate vaccine 95 % CI ; - GMT titer 95 % CI . Evaluation immune protective effect : Monitor Influenza Like Illness ( ILI ) subject monitoring place conduct epidemiological survey ILI . Collect nasopharyngeal swab blood specimen acute recovery period laboratory test . ILI refers fever ( body temperature≥38℃ ) cough pharyngalgia . Test influenza virus nucleic acid nasopharyngeal swab . Isolate serum blood specimen carry test serum antibody . Evaluation indicator : - Statistics ILI incidence rate immune population - Statistics incidence rate monitoring place</detailed_description>
