	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare 2 type radiotherapy , stereotactic body photon radiotherapy ( SBRT ) stereotactic body proton radiotherapy ( SBPT ) . Researchers would like compare side effect , quality life , cancer control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Versus Stereotactic Body Proton Therapy ( SBPT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SBRT SBPT : Both SBRT SBPT affect tumor cell way . SBRT common radiation technique two study show effective . However , SBRT may cause side effect tumor close normal organ photon stop totally hits tumor cell . SBPT type radiation use charged-up particle . This beam particles target like laser hit tumor . When beam travel tissue , start slow . Doctors control deep radiation particle go , make sure enough radiation hit tumor target avoids surround normal organ . Both form radiation plan radiologist ( radiation doctor ) decide dosage radiation give . Radiation technician follow doctor 's instruction deliver dose radiation . Because body move radiation , photon proton beam sometimes may trouble stay target . Proton radiation affect motion body photon radiation . However , doctor use many method reduce motion . Study Groups/Therapy : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance either group . - If Group 1 , receive SBRT . - If Group 2 , receive SBPT . You receive 4 treatment SBRT SBPT . During treatment , lie still table 30-45 minute per day position 4 day row . You feel , see , smell anything photon proton beam delivery . If randomly assign SBPT , member radiation therapy staff place 1-5 tiny metal pellet ( call fiducial marker ) around tumor help radiation doctor locate tumor daily proton therapy . The procedure could do bronchoscopy use CT-guided needle placement chest wall . Study Visits : Once week treatment : - You ask side effect may . - You physical exam . - Your medical history record . Length Study : You finish study treatment 4th treatment SBRT SBPT . You longer able continue SBRT SBPT lesion disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction procedure . However , still receive alternative treatment . Follow-up Visits : After treatment , 6 week , every 3 month ( +/-1 month ) 2 year , every 6 month ( +/-1 month ) 3 year , year rest life follow-up . This follow-up schedule standard care . - You physical exam . - Your medical history record . - You chest CT PET scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Between 6 week 6 month treatment 1 time year 2 year , lung function test . On 3rd 4th follow-up visit 1 time year 2 year , ECG . A SPECT scan may perform 3rd 4th visit doctor think need . Your participation study complete follow-up visit 2 year . After 2 year follow , follow accord standard care describe . If follow-up another hospital , information medical history , physical exam , lung function , PET CT scan sent MD Anderson review . This investigational study . SBRT SBPT FDA approve treatment lung cancer . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histological confirmation ( biopsy cytology ) clinically diagnose primary nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The following primary cancer type eligible : squamous cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , large cell carcinoma , bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma , nonsmall cell carcinoma otherwise specify 2 . Centrally locate , define locate within 2 cm central bronchial tree ( carina , right leave main bronchus , right leave upper lobe bronchus , bronchus intermedius , right middle lobe bronchus , lingular bronchus , right leave low lobe bronchus ) , major vessel ( aorta , pulmonary artery trunk , left/right pulmonary artery/vein main branch , superior/inferior vena cava , brachiocephalic artery trunk left/right brachiocephalic vein , left/right subclavian artery/vein ) , esophagus , heart , tracheal , pericardium , mediastinal pleural brachial plexus , chest wall vertebral body , direct invasion , Stage I ( T1T2a &lt; = 5 cm without main bronchus involvement ) , selective stage II ( selective T3 involvement mediastinal pleura , parietal pericardium , ) base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : 3. continue criterion # 2 ) History/physical examination include weight assessment Zubrod performance status within 2 month prior registration ; Evaluation experience thoracic cancer clinician within 2 month prior registration ; compute tomography ( CT ) scan intravenous contrast ( unless medically contraindicate ) entirety lung mediastinum , part liver , adrenal gland acquire within 2 month prior registration must available . The primary tumor dimension measure CT lung window . If PET/CT perform within 2 month prior registration , CT chest recommend require . Whole body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDGPET ) within 3 month prior registration adequate visualization primary tumor drain lymph node basin hilar mediastinal region adrenal gland ; Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) : 4. continued inclusion # 3 ) Routine spirometry , lung volume , diffusion capacity ( within 3 month prior registration ) . Patients hilar mediastinal lymph node &lt; /= 1cm abnormal hilar mediastinal uptake PET consider N0 . Patients &gt; 1 cm hilar mediastinal lymph node CT abnormal PET ( include suspicious nondiagnostic uptake ) may still eligible directed tissue biopsy abnormally identify area negative cancer . The primary tumor consider medically inoperable experienced thoracic cancer clinician standard lobectomy mediastinal lymph node dissection/sampling procedure patient refuse surgery . The patient may underlie physiological medical problem would prohibit surgery due low probability tolerate general anesthesia , operation , postoperative recovery period , removal adjacent functioning lung . 5. continued inclusion # 4 ) These type patient severe underlie health problem deem `` medically inoperable . '' Standard justification deem patient medically inoperable base pulmonary function surgical resection NSCLC may include follow : Baseline force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) &lt; 50 % predict , postoperative FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict , severely reduced diffusion capacity , baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia , exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50 % predict , severe pulmonary hypertension , diabetes mellitus severe end organ damage , severe cerebral , cardiac , peripheral vascular disease , severe chronic heart disease . If patient medically resectable/operable disease decline surgery consult thoracic surgeon , he/she consider eligible . 6 .
