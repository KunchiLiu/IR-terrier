	<brief_summary>The investigator undertake multi-center , 6000 subject validation study several biomarkers early detection colon cancer . There 2 stool base biomarkers ( one panel ) 1 serum base biomarker validate study . The biomarkers compare colonoscopy FIT ( fecal immunohistochemistry ) test current standard colon cancer screen . This NCI-early Detection Research Network fund project . The population target study person undergo colonoscopy screen routine surveillance . Prior colonoscopy even prepping colonoscopy , subject provide blood stool sample well specific data regard GI general medical history concomitant medication . If subject interested participating , arrangement make see . The informed consent process take place , blood obtain , data obtain , stool kit describe give subject take home . Stool sample send back University Michigan sit use prepay UPS mail label .</brief_summary>
