	<brief_summary>Interventional Allocation : Randomized Endpoint Classification : Safety/Efficacy Study combine chelation therapy Masking : Open Label Primary Purpose : Treatment transfusional iron overload Primary Outcome Measures : • The primary outcome measure ass efficacy lower serum ferritin level ( change serum ferritin compare baseline ) combine DFP deferasirox compare combined DFP DFO condition severe chronic iron overload ; show up-trend SF previous 12 month single chelator . Secondary Outcome Measures : • The secondary outcome measure determine number patient develop adverse event order ass safety upon administer drug combination ( DFP DFX ) compare combination DFO DFP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population : 1 . Beta-thalassemia major patient ; Patients high iron store Serum ferritin consistently &gt; 2500 mcg/l increase trend previous 12 month Liver iron &gt; 14 mg/g dry weight- R2 MRI 2 . Other cause transfusional hemosiderosis Estimated Enrollment : 30 patient arm Study Start Date : January 1st ; 2011 enrollment period 8 week Estimated Study Completion Date : End February 1212 Arms Assigned Interventions Arm 1 : Patients treat combined DFP deferasirox . Drug : Ferriprox It give orally morning Other Name : DFP Initial dose 25/mg/kg 3 divide dos ( well tolerate start built 4 week ) . Dose may increase 100mg/kg/day guided serum ferritin . Agranulocytosis risk 1-2 % . Monitor TLC granulocytic count / 2weeks . Patients need continually educate risk , know must stop DFP fever infection . Drug : Deferasirox orally administer dose 20 mg/kg daily even 5 day . Other Name : ICL670 Arm 2 : Patients treat 6 day combination deferoxamine DFP . Interventions : - Drug : Deferoxamine - Drug : DFP Drug : Deferoxamine Deferoxamine administer subcutaneously 8 hour 5 day dose 40 mg/kg . Other Name : Desferal , DFO Drug : DFP DFP : orally administer dose 75mg/kg orally 3 divide dos 7 day Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 6 18Years Genders Eligible Study : Both Inclusion Criteria : - Subjects transfusional iron overload Approval Ethical committee give write informed consent . - Subjects must serum ferritin great &gt; 2500 ng/mL , platelet count great 100,000/mm3 , serum creatinine within normal range . - A woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening .
