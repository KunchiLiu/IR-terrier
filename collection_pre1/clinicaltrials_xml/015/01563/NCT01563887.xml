	<detailed_description>The investigator demonstrate driver Type 1 diabetes least twice many collision non-diabetic spouse , half driver Type 1 diabetes least one hypoglycemic driving mishap year , 5 % least six event year . However , point investigator accurately predict individual hypoglycemia drive mishap , one goal study . The investigator also demonstrate face-to-face behavioral intervention focus reduce occurrence hypoglycemia lead significantly few vehicular collision citation . The question arise whether behavioral intervention , specifically focus reduce hypoglycemia driving , effectively deliver internet . Participants first complete Interest form . This questionnaire use determine individual 's presume risk category ( high low risk ) . Research staff use risk category randomly assign participant one four group accord randomization scheme . The four group include : 1 ) Routine Care - low risk , 2 ) Routine Care - high risk , 3 ) DiabetesDriving.com ( DD.com ) participate Internet intervention , 4 ) DiabetesDriving.com + Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) subject receive Internet intervention two 60 minute MI session telephone .
