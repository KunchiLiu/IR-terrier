	<criteria>The patient histologic cytologic confirmation ( upon local review ) small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . The patient extensivestage small cell lung cancer ( ESSCLC ) , define National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline . The patient measurable disease assess Response Evaluation Criteria Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1 ) . The patient receive prior chemotherapy , biological agent , investigational drug SCLC . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The patient 18 year age old time inform consent obtain . The patient must accessible study treatment followup . Patients enrol study must treat participate study center 3 day study drug administration either treatment group . The patient normal organ function . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test 72 hour prior study enrollment . Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception throughout entire study 8 week last dose study drug ( include obatoclax maintenance ) . Effective contraception birth control define low failure rate ( le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Women must breastfeed . Written inform consent obtain . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis may enrol clinically indicate , may treat steroid taper tolerated patient . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis eligible study receive therapeutic whole brain irradiation ( WBI ) , must complete least 7 day day first treatment study drug . Since patient also treat steroid recommend steroid taper clinically indicate tolerated patient . The use chronic , lowdose steroid contraindicate patient ( patient ) . Stereotactic radiation allow 1 3 brain metastatic lesion meet appropriate criterion procedure ; however , must discuss study monitor prior consideration enrollment study . The patient must willing able comply study restriction remain study center require duration study period willing return study center followup evaluation specify protocol . The patient prior systemic therapy ESSCLC radiation therapy surgery . The patient history prior malignancy exception cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , localized malignancy undergone potentially curative therapy deem treat physician low risk recurrence 5 year . The patient history hypersensitivity allergic reaction attribute component obatoclax mesylate formulation ( ie , polysorbate 20 polyethylene glycol [ PEG ] 300 ) carboplatin etoposide . The patient currently leptomeningeal disease paraneoplastic syndrome . The patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic neurologic illness ; active , uncontrolled systemic infection consider opportunistic , lifethreatening , clinically significant time treatment ; symptomatic congestive heart failure ; unstable angina pectoris ; clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ; significant pulmonary disease hypoxia ; psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement . The patient pregnant lactate woman . ( Any woman become pregnant study withdrawn study monitor safety . ) The patient positive test result hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) antibodies hepatitis C virus ( HCV Ab ) know positive history antibody human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) receive combination antiretroviral therapy .</criteria>
