	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor find good way treat cancer . PURPOSE : This research trial study gene sample patient limit advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9704-S0014-S0313A Studying Genes Samples From Patients With Limited Advanced Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine proportion cell origin subtypes ( germinal center B-cell-like [ GCB ] v non-GCB ) expression level prognostic gene previously identify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient biopsy sample SWOG trial limited- advanced-stage DLBCL , assess association result progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - To assess association marker result overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue analyze gene expression profile quantitative nuclease protection assay ( qNPA ) immunohistochemical analysis . Results compare patient 's progression-free survival overall survival .</detailed_description>
