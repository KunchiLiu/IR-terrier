	<brief_summary>Central venous catheter infection common preventable adverse event among hospital patient . Microbes may enter catheter hub , also know needleless connector , result downstream contamination . This study aim compare alcohol disinfection catheter hub disinfection chlorhexidine gluconate alcohol , proven superior disinfectant site central venous catheter insertion . Scrub duration central venous catheter hub also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hub Cleansing Prevent Hub Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized blind crossover clinical trial perform medical intensive care unit Rush University Medical Center . The intensive care unit divide two region ( A &amp; B ) . Hub disinfectant duration disinfection randomly assign region . After 1/2 study period , agent crossover , duration scrub remain , analogous 2 2 factorial design . Our primary endpoint internal contamination hub catheter . In February 2012 determine supplier chlorhexidine alcohol pad could completely blind pad . It decide plain white sticker would affix front pad , safety information back pad would remain visible . 3/27/12-Internal hub contamination ( yes/no ) clarify primary outcome . On 5/10/12 new sample size calculation adjust hub sample size need power main effect base accurate information regard expect hub contamination rate . The expected hub contamination rate change sensitive hub culture method adopt study begin . This sensitive method also allow new secondary outcome number microbial colony form unit per hub . The first crossover time select 6/11/12 , prior midpoint study . This do try improve large imbalance group size . On 6/11/12 hold place catheter tip component study , inability collect tip . On 8/7/12 catheter tip outcome drop inability collect tip . On 1/11/13 second crossover implement effort balance size study group .</detailed_description>
