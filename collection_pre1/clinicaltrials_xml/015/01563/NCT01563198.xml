	<brief_title>Reduction Claustrophobia Patient Motion After Training MRI Personnel Comfort TalkTM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Claustrophobia disruptive patient motion common impediment MRI examination , may prevent ameliorate non-pharmacologic behavioral intervention administer trained staff . The potential benefit intervention highly significant , consider alternative cancel study administer sedation . Inability complete MRI scan adversely affect estimate 700,000 patient every year US . These patient either deprived diagnosis , subject diagnostic delay , expose risk pharmacologic sedation , include death . The imaging facility turn , typically fill suddenly vacate examination slot time next scheduled patient thus incur considerable lose revenue efficiency . The long-term goal provide validate , clinically feasible mean non-pharmacologic amelioration claustrophobia disruptive patient motion , achieve training MRI staff use advance rapport skill comfort language help patient . Phase I design perform formative evaluation Comfort TalkTM Training intervention definitive test hypothesize benefit intervention accomplish Phase II . In Specific Aim 1 Comfort TalkTM intervention sequence design include train advanced rapport skill , use basic comforting language avoid negative language facility staff ( include receptionist , technologist , nurse , physician ) . A core license healthcare professional teach guide patient self-hypnotic relaxation technique , use script , find safe effective radiology department . Techniques design easily integrate normal workflow without add time . Training include 2x8 hrs live three test site . Acceptance , observation staff behavior , qualitative feedback , rate noncompletion use assess efficacy training , guide prototype development , develop train-the-trainer material . Using in-market piloting technique , niche application metric explore develop situationâ€”specific supplemental material . In Aim 2 interactive web-based electronic platform develop supplement training provide post-training support . It provide scenario practice application , guide dialogue option , function online live interactive class , interface Smartphones . The prototype beta-tested 20 expert hypnosis refine user input test site . Aim 3 conduct formative evaluation entire Comfort TalkTM intervention . Effects evaluate 3-months interval compare baseline performance . Criteria include acceptance , qualitative feedback , content mastery , staff behavior , rate noncompletion , patient recall satisfaction . Additional metric identify in-market exploration analyze potential economic driver evaluation instrument .</detailed_description>
