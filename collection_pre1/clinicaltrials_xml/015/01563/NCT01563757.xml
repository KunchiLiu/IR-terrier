	<brief_title>Plastic Bronchitis Protein Losing Enteropathy Children With Single Ventricle Physiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protein lose enteropathy ( PLE ) emerge increasingly common complication single ventricle palliation child bear cyanotic congenital heart disease . This entity become manifest month year modify Fontan operation think affect 5-15 % patient Fontan physiology . Patients PLE often suffer symptom relate severe hypoproteinemia intestinal malabsorption , include edema , ascites , pleural pericardial effusion , chronic diarrhea poor growth . Mortality strikingly high , 50 % patient survive 5 year follow diagnosis . The pathophysiology poorly understood several theory present possible mechanism include : 1 ) chronic low cardiac output intestinal injury lead loss intestinal integrity , 2 ) chronic intestinal inflammation lead loss intestinal integrity , 3 ) chronic elevate portal venous pressure intestinal injury lead loss intestinal integrity . Treatment sporadically successful include 1 ) create fenestration Fontan pathway pulmonary venous atrium decrease Fontan pressure increase cardiac output , 2 ) chronic use unfractionated low molecular weight heparin reconstitute intestinal basement membrane , 3 ) Use oral steroid reduce intestinal inflammation , 4 ) Use pulmonary vasodilator reduce Fontan pressure increase cardiac output 5 ) implantation pacemaker treat sinus node dysfunction improve cardiac output , 6 ) heart transplantation . Short cardiac transplantation , treatment PLE , include effort change systemic and/or gastrointestinal hemodynamics , routinely successful . Thus , appear etiology PLE complex simply `` high venous pressure gut '' previously believe . A second entity see patient modify Fontan procedure `` plastic bronchitis '' ( PB ) . This highly morbid clinical picture persistent production high mucoprotein-containing airway secretion cause severe airway obstruction lead increased work breathing , V/Q mismatch progressive respiratory failure lead death . The etiology plastic bronchitis understood beyond supportive , palliative measure lung lavage , current treatment plastic bronchitis . VIP Substance P small peptide significant autocrine paracrine signal ability . The role VIP control gut protein solute secretion understand approximately 20 year . The clinical entity best describe rare `` VIP-omas '' chromophore secrete gut tumor massive amount VIP secrete tumor overwhelm body 's normal ability clear VIP cleavage neutral endopeptidases pulmonary endothelium . Until recently , Substance P know primarily role peptidogenic signal sensory pathway . As described , important previously understood role Substance P control human airway mucus secretion recently describe . Scientific Basis Proposed Research : The basis proposal arise three , independent streams research . 1 . First , extensive investigation patient increase portal venous pressure , usually cirrhosis , show increased portal venous pressure lead significant increase excretion wide variety small peptide signal molecule . Included molecule VIP , 5-HT Substance P.As patient Fontan physiology always increase portal gut venous pressure direct consequence anatomic palliation , stand reason likewise increase GI production signal peptide . 2 . Second , clearance gut-derived signal peptide VIP , Substance P , angiotensin , brandykinin others occur primarily lung via peptide cleavage catalyze neutral endopeptidases , class enzyme heavily resident pulmonary circulation . The role neutral endopeptidases cleave thus inactivate small peptide 'protect '' systemic circulation plethora vasoactive peptide come systemic circulation . With respect potential role VIP and/or Substance P etiology PLE PB , important note patient Fontan physiology current practice fenestrate Fontan shunt allow portion systemic venous blood flow bypass lung . Thus , vasoactive / signal peptide return low body systemic venous circulation bypass pulmonary clearance mechanism proportion degree fenestration shunt moment . This pulmonary clearance bypass physiology relative unique medicine old patient Fontan-palliated congenital heart disease thus may , part , basis PLE PB see almost uniquely Fontan patient . Further implicate derangement active peptide clearance physiology etiology PLE PB fact classic member neutral endopeptidase class ( misname ) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) , actually cleave number small peptide signal molecule include VIP Substance P. Virtually patient Fontan physiology large dose ACE-inhibitors low systemic afterload . Captopril-induced inhibition VIP Substance P inactivation would significantly increase already elevated systemic level signal peptide potentiate etiology PLE PB Fontan-palliated patient . Variations neutral endopeptidase inhibitor ( `` ACE inhibitor '' ) drug dosage and/or genotype variation ACE cause dramatically alter activity part explain variable incidence PLE PB Fontan physiology patient . In study , use dose ACE inhibitor patient record see correlation ACE inhibitor dose measure VIP Substance P level . There wide variation ACE gene genomics describe decade . Intriguingly , approximately 10-15 % person newly describe genomic variation ACE gene lead profoundly reduce circulating level ACE increase susceptibility ACE inhibition 10-15 % patient Fontans develop PB PLE . 3 . Lastly , recent work completely change understanding control normal , basal mucus solute secretion human airways gut . Here-to-fore believe cholinergic mechanism control airway mucus secretion . This recent still emerge work show fact VIP Substance P act individually synergistically control normal basal human airway mucus production regulate gut secretion . This new work give unifying hypothesis seemingly disparate entity PLE PB : since Substance P VIP control normal basal human airway secretion stimulate human gut protein secretion , increase pulmonary venous and/or gut arterial level peptide basis PLE PB . The GI , cardiac pulmonary physiology pharmacologic treatment patient fenestrated Fontans perfect set interaction occur . Taken totality , three streams independent research give strong basis hypothesis palliative physiology pharmacologic treatment Fontan patient lead increased level VIP , Substance P , may causal pathophysiology PB PLE . Rationale Current Study Design Subject Recruitment : Consistent Aims Hypotheses , four patient group study : ) Fontan Physiology Patients PLE PB Patients ii ) Fontan Physiology Patients without PLE PB iii ) Patients Glenn Physiology Congenital Heart Disease iv ) Patients 2 ventricle physiology atrial septal defect serve Control group . Measurement mixed venous arterial level substance P VIP 4 group subject allow u determine effect elevate portal venous pressure production clearance substance P VIP well effect alter hepatic-pulmonary blood flow clearance substance P VIP . This allow u determine 1 ) systemic arterial level substance P VIP level elevate Fontan patient compare control , elevate , 2 ) whether due increase hepatic production , reduce pulmonary clearance . The rationale inclusion patient group summarize . Subjects Fontan physiology ( Group I II ) unique physiology superior vena cava ( SVC ) inferior vena cava ( IVC ) connect directly pulmonary artery thereby bypass heart . This palliation scheme allow separation pulmonary systemic circulation patient univentricular heart essentially eliminate cyanosis . These patient non-pulsitile pulmonary artery flow elevate central venous portal venous pressure . Therefore , suspect patient increased production substance P VIP . In addition , fenestration ( hole ) , create Fontan conduit atrium time Fontan surgery order lower central venous pressure increase cardiac output create right left intracardiac shunt . It suspect patient elevated systemic venous arterial level vasoactive peptide result 1 ) increase hepatic/gut production , 2 ) decrease pulmonary vascular clearance , and/or 3 ) intracardiac right leave shunt . Studying subject allow u determine systemic venous systemic arterial level Substance P VIP alter Fontan circulation . By compare systemic arterial venous level vasoactive peptide among control , Glenn physiology Fontan physiology group hope measure difference vasoactive peptide level could responsible development PLE PB Fontan physiology patient . Subjects Glenn physiology ( Group III ) unique physiology hepatic venous low body venous blood return heart enters systemic ventricle recirculated body combine pulmonary venous blood . There direct connection thru heart hepatic venous blood enter pulmonary artery . Therefore , suspect patient likely elevated systemic arterial circulating level Substance P VIP due intracardiac right left shunt reduce pulmonary clearance . However , since patient typically normal portal venous pressure , think increase production vasoactive peptide . In addition , patient historically risk develop PLE PB . Studying subject allow u determine systemic venous systemic arterial level Substance P VIP alter Glenn circulation . By compare systemic arterial venous level vasoactive peptide among control , Glenn physiology Fontan physiology group hope measure difference vasoactive peptide level could responsible development PLE PB Fontan physiology patient . Control group subject ( Group IV ) normal hepatic-pulmonary blood flow normal portal venous pressure . An atrial septal defect allow leave right shunt blood thru heart typically result elevate pulmonary artery right ventricular pressure . These subject normal flow hepatic venous blood pulmonary capillary bed . Therefore normal hepatic production pulmonary clearance substance P VIP .</detailed_description>
