	<brief_title>A Phase I/II , Open-label Study Ofatumumab Added Chlorambucil Previously Untreated Japanese Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study evaluate tolerability , safety , efficacy pharmacokinetic profile ofatumumab combination chlorambucil Japanese patient previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Ofatumumab infuse intravenously Day 1 ( 300 mg ) Day 8 ( 1000 mg ) first 28-day cycle , follow infusion 1000 mg first day 28-day cycle . Chlorambucil give 10 mg/m2 Day 1-7 28-day cycle . The primary objective evaluate tolerability overall response rate ( ORR ) ofatumumab chlorambucil previously untreated ( frontline ) CLL . Secondary objective include evaluate complete remission ( CR ) rate , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , time response , duration response , time next therapy , incidence severity adverse event serious adverse event , incidence grade 3 4 infection myelosuppression ( anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ) , pharmacokinetics ofatumumab chlorambucil .</detailed_description>
