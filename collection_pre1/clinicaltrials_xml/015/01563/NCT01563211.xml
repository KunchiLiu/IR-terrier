	<brief_summary>Patients breast cancer , treat curative intent , combination surgery ( excision tumor ) course medical therapy ( chemotherapy endocrine treatment ) . Both treatment associate significant side effect . Chemotherapy associate nausea , vomit , hair loss bone marrow suppression , whereas endocrine therapy associate arthritis menopausal symptom . Patients take either chemotherapy endocrine treatment may experience range side effect . The range severity side effect experience vary patient patient . Little nothing know reason difference . The aim investigator proposal develop pretreatment test identify patient likely undergo moderate severe side effect , therefore help doctor patient plan optimize medical therapy . The pretreatment test base identify metabolic profile differentiate patient likely severe moderate side effect either mild side effect . To , investigator take urine blood sample patient administration endocrine treatment chemotherapy generate metabolic profile . Furthermore , investigator aim gain understanding side effect experience different patient variable . To investigator plan perform cytokine analysis , target genetic analysis pharmaokinetic analysis blood sample collect patient treatment commence . Patients plan surgical excision tumor recommend receive medical therapy surgery would invite join study . Each patient require make additional visit hospital complete questionnaire regard side effect experience sample ( urine blood ) collection . The investigator plan recruit 168 patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients breast cancer treat combination surgery medical treatment ( either ( neoadjuvant ) ( adjuvant ) surgery ) . Eligible patient identify oncologist multidisciplinary meeting . Once eligible patient identify informed study oncologist , approach research team give patient information leaflet , discus study , answer question ask patient sign consent form would like participate study . The consent form must sign study relate procedure perform . Patients surgery prior receive medical treatment ( i.e . patient plan receive adjuvant treatment , patient sentinel lymph node biopsy prior start neoadjuvant treatment ) blood urine sample take surgery , preassessment surgical appointment . The week patient start medical therapy ( either chemotherapy endocrine treatment ) patient need attend Charing Cross Hospital follow procedure ( may extra visit , depend hospital appointment ) : - To see study doctor medical history physical examination - Pulse blood pressure measurement - BMI ( body mass index ) body fat assessment - To fill quality life ( QOL ) questionnaire research staff - Routine blood test ( haematology biochemistry ) - Blood sample metabolic profile cytokine analysis - Urine sample metabolic profile - The blood take additionally test target genetic analysis patient consent ( optional ) The patient ask return Charing Cross Hospital 24 hour later overnight fast ( extra visit ) : • Fasted blood urine sample metabolic profiling . It important get fast sample patient , diet influence metabolic profile . Therefore try eliminate diet confounder important get fast sample . Additionally , time collection blood urine sample metabolic profile analysis patient ask last ate , last ate specific dietary preferences/requirements ( i.e . vegetarian , gluten free diet ) . Further test differ depend whether patient receive chemotherapy endocrine treatment . Patients receive chemotherapy 6 cycle , cycle last 21 day . There two type chemotherapy give breast cancer FEC ( 6 cycle 5fluorouracil , epirubicin cyclophosphamide ) FECD ( 3 cycle 5fluorouracil , epirubicin cyclophosphamide follow 3 cycle docetaxel ) . Patients receive type chemotherapy ( FEC FECD ) patient require attend following time procedure explain : - Cycle 1 , day 2 24 hour patient receive chemotherapy treatment take urine blood sample metabolic profiling , blood sample routine blood test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . - At time patient also ask fill 2 questionnaire research staff - first adverse effect experience ( question CTCAEv4.0 ) , second QOL questionnaire . - This extra visit . - Cycle 2 , day 1 - Prior receive next cycle chemotherapy urine blood sample take metabolic profiling . Blood sample take routine test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . - Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff . - A blood sample take 10 minute chemotherapy infusion finish . Pharmacokinetic analysis 5FU conducted sample . If possible sample take cannula chemotherapy medication administer ( first 10mls need discard avoid contamination ) . - This extra visit change plan This extra visit change plan treatment schedule . If patient consent optional pharmacokinetic analysis follow sample also take . - Cycle 2 , day 1 ( optional assessment ) Three blood sample take follow 4 hour pharmacokinetic analysis cylophosphamide epirubicin . If possible sample take cannula chemotherapy administer . - Cycle 2 , day 2 ( optional assessment ) A blood sample take 24 hour chemotherapy give pharmacokinetic analysis cyclophosphamide . - Cycle 2 , day 3 ( optional assessment ) A blood sample take 48 hour chemotherapy give pharmacokinetic analysis epirubicin . - Cycle 6 , day 21 - Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff . - BMI ( body mass index ) body fat assessment . - This extra visit . If patient FECD chemotherapy , attend time point , additionally ask attend docetaxel commence . This required test whether docetaxel different reaction body previous chemotherapy give . Patients ask attend follow time point follow procedure : - Cycle 4 , day 2 24 hour patient receive chemotherapy treatment take urine blood sample metabolic profiling , blood sample routine blood test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff This extra visit - Cycle 5 , day 1 - Prior receive next cycle chemotherapy urine blood sample take metabolic profiling . Blood sample take routine test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . - Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff . - This extra visit change plan treatment schedule . If patient consent optional pharmacokinetic analysis follow sample also take . • Cycle 5 , day 1 A blood sample take end chemotherapy infusion 6 hour infusion complete . If possible blood sample take cannula ( first 10mls take cannula need discard avoid contamination ) . Patients receive endocrine treatment ask attend follow time point start treatment procedure list , addition baseline assessment describe : - Day 2 - Urine blood sample metabolic profile . Blood sample routine test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . - This extra visit - Day 21 - Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff . - Urine blood sample metabolic profile . Blood sample routine test ( haematology biochemistry ) cytokine analysis . - This extra visit - At 5 month - Two questionnaire ( questionnaire base adverse effect experience QOL questionnaire ) complete research staff . - BMI ( body mass index ) body fat assessment . - A blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis - This extra visit All procedures interview conduct Charing Cross Hospital . All patient enrol study 5 month . However , patient receive chemotherapy , change treatment schedule oncologist time patient spend study increase accordance change make treatment schedule ( i.e . cycle 4 ( docetaxel ) start 1 week late , time study 5 month 1 week ) . For patient receive neoadjuvant treatment ( chemotherapy endocrine treatment surgery ) look image pathology report establish tumour respond treatment . We aim recruit 168 patient , 84 receive endocrine therapy ( either oestrogen receptor antagonist aromatase inhibitor ) 84 receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( FEC FECD ) . The study conduct 5 phase : 1 . Patient recruitment collection sample ( month 112 ) 2 . H NMR spectroscopic analysis UPLMS analysis sample ( month 718 ) 3 . Mathematical modelling data ( month 120 ) 4 . Structural identification candidate biomarkers ( month 1822 ) 5 . Write result guideline ( month 2024 ) The result analyse publish ( presentation peer review journal ) end study . No patient identifiable information present publication . As test carry research purpose direct benefit patient participate study , plan inform patient individual result . Patients inform overall result study may result publication .</detailed_description>
