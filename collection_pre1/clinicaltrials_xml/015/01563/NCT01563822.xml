	<brief_summary>Background : Traditionally ovum pick-up ICSI , aspirate follicle oocyte retrieval unfortunately n't make use follicular fluid ( FF ) discard spite fact happen nature . The fallopian tube picks-up FF oocyte ovulation . As fluid contain stem cell factor C-Kit receptor responsible implantation IGF responsible endometrial growth TGF improve implantation . That 's flush endometrial cavity FF ovum pick-up might improve endometrial receptivity implantation rate ; limit step ICSI . Patients Methods : 100 patient attend kasr El-Aini IVF center prepare ICSI cycle randomize two group . In study group , flush endometrial cavity 2ml clear follicular fluid surround mature oocytes IUI catheter do ovum pick-up While control group , flush endometrial cavity FF do . The implantation rate pregnancy rate group assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Flushing Uterine Cavity With Follicular Fluid After Ovum Pick-up Improve Implantation Rates ICSI Cycles ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Looking process IVF , find make use ovum sperm neglect completely valuable effect follicular fluid currently attract lot attention . Several study reveal pivotal role play fluid process fertilization implantation rich growth factor stem cell factor , transform growth factor insulin growth factor cytokine ( 1,2 ) . Macci√≤ study confirm follicular fluid ( FF ) contain factor induce immunosuppression explain immunosuppressive activity FF mediate specific inhibition production IL-1 alpha IL-2 decreased expression CD25 ( 3 ) . During ovum pick-up , aspirate FF throw away ovum retrieval . This fluid normally enter fallopian tube pick ovum ovulation natural cycle reach uterine cavity well several study suggest might crucial role modify uterine receptivity prepare endometrium fertilize ovum arrive 3 day TGF control apoptosis , IGF improve endometrial thickness immunosuppressive activity FF pave way embryo implant uterine cavity ( 4,5 ) . Actually Hunter study 2007 , provide circumstantial evidence entry follicular fluid Fallopian tube , especially close time ovulation , suggestion entry could modify nature endosalpingeal secretion transudation . Thereafter , spectrum gonadal hormone follicular fluid could influence uterine tissue local manner ( 5 ) . At time , well know fact implantation limit step IVF success , actually almost IVF cycle succeed offer fertilized ovum give rise embryo different stage development unfortunately transfer uterine cavity , 60 % fail implant . Implantation complex initial step establishment successful pregnancy . Although embryo quality important determinant implantation , temporally co-ordinated differentiation endometrial cell attain uterine receptivity synchronize dialogue maternal embryonic tissue crucial . Optimizing endometrial receptivity fertility treatment improve success rate . Several growth factor cytokines appear involve process implantation . Stem cell factor receptor c-kit regulate progression survival germ cell play important role follicular development . It present follicular fluid however little information available role stem cell factor receptor process blastocyst implantation . It Mitsunari examine expression stem cell factor receptor mouse embryo stromal epithelial cell uterine endometrium reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction . He illustrate stem cell factor derive endometrial cell implant embryo exerts paracrine autocrine action process implantation stimulate trophoblast outgrowth receptor c-kit ( 6 ) . Neglecting importance follicular fluid throw away process IVF actually deviation happen nature fallopian tube intelligent enough appreciate value fluid pick ovum . That study , want mimic natural cycle explore benefit flush uterine cavity follicular fluid ovum pick-up improve implantation rate ICSI cycle . Materials method : 100 patient attend kasr El-Ainey IVF center prepare ICSI cycle randomize two group . In prospective interventional study , patient group receive induction protocol control ovarian hyperstimulation long protocol , standard protocol center . Initial suppression ovarian function gonadotrophin release hormone agonist start day 21 preceeding cycle . Human menopausal gonadotrophin induction start confirm ovarian regulation laboratory investigation ultrasound daily intramuscular injection 150-300 IU ( Merional , IBSA ) least 3 follicle reach 18 mm serum estradiol level lie 1000-4000 10000 IU , HCG give . Ovum pick-up schedule 35 hour later , follicle aspirate separate tube examine embryologist separately : - The follicular fluid empty follicle discard , FF follicles mature oocytes retrieve use . - The follicular fluid contaminate blood discard would use , clear FF use . - No flushing use oocyte aspiration order interfere concentration growth factor FF . After explain procedure take informed consent patient : 2ml clear follicular fluid inject uterine cavity flush endometrium IUI catheter perform mock transfer study group . While , control group , flush endometrial cavity FF do . In group , embryo transfer carry 2-3 day later accord condition embryo pregnancy test carry 14 day later . The protocol approve review board kasr el-Aini hospital ; IVF center Cairo university .</detailed_description>
