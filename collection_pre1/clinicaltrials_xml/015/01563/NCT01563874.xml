	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We propose analyze histone chromatin modification several class patient : 1 ) patient bear diagnosis lymphoid malignancy make confirm NIH . Solid tumor lymphoid system would constitute major source tissue , however tissue sample patient malignant diagnosis involve circulate malignant cell ( Mycosis fungoides , Sezary syndrome , etc . ) would also appropriate analysis ; 2 ) nonmalignant lymphoid tissue obtain diagnostic purpose normal lymphoid tissue obtain incidentally surgery ( case residual surplus tissue use , express approval appropriate clinical investigator ( ) . Primarily include among tissue would hyperplastic lymphoid tissue especially tonsil . Other hyperplastic nonmalignant lymph node sample show proliferative response sinus histiocytosis would also appropriate compare malignant sample . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Only case sufficient frozen biopsy material initial biopsy and/or biopsy relapse disease obtain adequate tissue lysates proteomicbased analysis select case ChIPSeq follow analysis RNA expression perform superseding protocol . In case , histone modification , may possible recover appropriate tissue paraffin embed block , however sample use study without prior consultation approval clinical investigator hematopathologist associate superseding protocol . Samples minor &lt; 18 year old use .</criteria>
