	<brief_summary>Fatigue symptom present 76 92 % people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Fatigue usually describe overwhelming sense tiredness , lack energy , feel exhaustion different sleepiness . Fatigue also symptom commonly see people obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . The overall objective develop non-pharmacological treatment fatigue MS . The objective study evaluate treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) improve fatigue MS subject OSA fatigue . This small pilot randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled clinical trial ; control group treat sham-CPAP machine intervention group treat auto-titration CPAP machine . The primary outcome measure improvement ( decrease ) Modified Fatigue Impact Scale baseline . The duration intervention 12 week achieve clinical response treatment group . After intervention participant group offer referral sleep clinic preference formal treatment per standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) demyelinate inflammatory disease one common neurological cause disability young adult . Besides physical disability , fatigue common symptom present 76 92 % people MS . The 1998 Multiple Sclerosis Council clinical practice guideline publish consensus definition : subjective lack physical and/or mental energy perceive individual caregiver interfere usual desired activity . Although fatigue may difficult differentiate sleepiness , clinically different symptom . Sleepiness tendency fall asleep doze . Some report prevalence moderate severe sleep problem MS significantly high general population 51.5 % vs 33.1 % . It also report poor sleep correlate depression subject MS. Few study examine effect stimulant , amantadine modafinil treatment fatigue show contradictory data effective treatment MS patient . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) also see describe MS. Few case report study report MS patient OSA treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) improvement fatigue quality life . Although prevalence OSA MS population unknown , may much twice common general population , 3 7 % . Aside increase risk daytime sleepiness , mood disorder , cardiovascular risk factor accident , OSA also implicate increase inflammatory marker like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-α ) . Elevation TNF-α also see MS patient complain fatigue , think play role pathophysiology fatigue MS . The rational study determine treatment OSA CPAP MS patient improve fatigue . If effective , CPAP may decrease risk long term complication may also improve quality life daily living patient .</detailed_description>
