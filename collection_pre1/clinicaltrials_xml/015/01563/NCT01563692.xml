Severe RSV infection early life associate increase risk subsequent recurrent wheeze asthma . There population-based estimate incidence RSV disease develop country , exist data clearly indicate virus account high proportion Acute Respiratory Infections ( ARI ) child . Studies Brazil , Colombia Thailand suggest RSV cause 20-30 % ARI case child 1-4 year age , proportion similar industrialized country , WHO estimate global RSV disease burden 64 million case 160 000 death every year . RSV also cause severe disease elderly immune-compromised adult , burden RSV disease elderly comparable seasonal influenza . The economic impact RSV-related disease adult estimate great influenza relation number day lose work . The development safe effective vaccine RSV would benefit greatly data immune response healthy adult naturally expose virus . RSV infection show increase induce short-lived circulate antibody secrete cell produce increase RSV specific antibody titre limit data available cellular immune response induce RSV natural infection healthy adult . The existence cell mediate immune response RSV human describe characterization response remain poor simultaneous analysis several immunological parameter attempt RSV expose population .</brief_summary>
