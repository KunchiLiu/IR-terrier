	<brief_summary>This study focus three different lesion : pancreatic cyst , lymph node near gastrointestinal tract pancreatic mass . On one hand , result obtain previous study advance assessment diagnostic performance Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) system Pancreatic cyst . Safety technical feasibility already perform , interpretation criterion classification exist . On hand , result pancreatic mass Lymph node less developed . The study therefore comprise two sub-studies , one pancreatic cyst , another pancreatic mass lymph node . 1 . Cysts The primary hypothesis study use nCLE addition EUS-FNA tissue sample allows good characterization pancreatic cyst improve appropriate therapeutic decision-making . For physician , integrate nCLE diagnostic algorithm pancreatic cyst could impact patient management : - Ruling malignancy patient benign appear nCLE image . - Characterizing malignant tumor pancreas . 2 . Pancreatic mass Lymph node The primary hypothesis study vivo image lymph-nodes near gastrointestinal tract pancreatic mass EUS-FNA procedure feasible descriptive criterion define differentiate different type lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Medical background Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer-related death United States . This disease associate high mortality rate : 5-year survival rate estimate 4 % . This mainly due fact disease often discover already advanced disease state , carry dismal prognosis . 1.1 . Pancreatic Cysts Pancreatic cyst quite rare , increasingly recognize due expand use cross-sectional imaging . They classify three main class : - Pseudocysts - Serous cyst : either serous cystic neoplasm ( SCN ) Solid pseudo-papillary neoplasm ( SPN ) - Mucinous cystic neoplasm : either Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm ( IPMN ) mucinous cystadenomas/mucinous cystadenocarcinoma ( MCN ) Mucinous cystic neoplasm consider malignant pre-malignant consider surgical resection , whereas pseudocysts serous cyst consider benign low potential malignancy . Pseudocysts serous cyst usually consider surgical resection symptomatic enlarging . 1.2 . Pancreatic mass Pancreatic solid mass either exocrine endocrine tumor , metastatic.Exocrine tumor far common type pancreas cancer . Most malignant . About 96 % cancer exocrine pancreas adenocarcinoma , aggressive form pancreas cancer.Endocrine tumor uncommon . They represent 4 % pancreas tumor . They know neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) , islet cell tumor . These tumor benign malignant . 1.3 . Lymph node Lymph node examine patient suspicion , confirm , cancer , part stag . They may either normal , inflammatory , malignant . 2 . Clinical background 2.1 . EUSFNA Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) diagnostic method choice pancreatic lesion find incidentally cross-sectional imaging . Endoscopic UltraSound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration ( EUS FNA ) ( respectively Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration ( EBUS FNA ) ) procedures target tissue proximity GI tract ( respectively pulmonary tract ) biopsied use fine needle guide real time ultrasound probe fix tip endoscope.It may therefore applied pancreatic lesion , lymph node examination . 2.2. nCLE The principle needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) image organ within adjacent GI respiratory tract miniprobe insert endoscopic needle . The fundamental technology well principle operation nCLE substantially similar pCLE . 3 . Clinical evidence More 100 patient already underwent nCLE procedure , past study . A first feasibility study enable define final type probe would fit EUSFNA needle , INSPECT study enable define interpretation criterion micro-structure pancreatic cyst . Less data available pancreatic mass lymph node , except image do first feasibility study . 4 . Objectives 4.1 . Cysts 4.1.1 . The primary objective study assess diagnostic performance Cellvizio nCLE system diagnose pancreatic cyst , associate diagnostic information . 4.1.2 . The secondary objective assess potential impact Cellvizio nCLE system patient management validate interpretation classification criterion create previous INSPECT study cyst . 4.2 . Pancreatic mass Lymph nod 4.2.1 . The primary objective study define criterion nCLE sequence lymph node pancreatic mass . 4.2.2 . The secondary objective evaluate feasibility safety Cellvizio nCLE EUS-FNA procedure , build atlas image nCLE sequence pancreatic mass lymph node , , finally , retrospectively assess diagnostic performance nCLE diagnosis pancreatic mass lymph node , associate diagnostic information 5 . Design This study conduct three center France .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female &gt; 18 year age . Patient indicate first EUSFNA pancreatic cyst , lymph node pancreatic mass , Patients previous nondiagnostic tissue sample take previous EUSFNA pancreatic cyst , lymph node , pancreatic mass , three month ago . Patient know pancreatic cyst mass detect crosssectional imaging suspicious lymph node reachable via EUSFNA Willing able comply study procedure provide write informed consent participate study . Add lymph node : lymph node reachable EUSFNA Add pancreatic mass : size location pancreas Subjects EUSFNA procedure contraindicate Known allergy fluorescein dye If female , pregnant base positive hCG serum vitro diagnostic test result breastfeed Add cyst : Subject multiple cyst size &lt; 20mm diameter previous EUSFNA procedure perform less 3 month ago Patients suffer chronic calcify pancreatitis Add lymph node : size &lt; 5mm diameter If patient present several suspicious lymph node , one image nCLE procedure Add pancreatic mass : If patient present several pancreatic mass , one image nCLE procedure</criteria>
