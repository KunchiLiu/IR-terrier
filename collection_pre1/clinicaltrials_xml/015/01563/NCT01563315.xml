	<detailed_description>Background : This project address important challenge international medicine : Pneumonia lead cause death infection develop country . Purpose : ( A ) Determine etiology CAP among adult hospitalize patients- especially occurrence mixed infections- systematic implementation combine conventional new diagnostic method . ( B ) Assess risk factor CAP , COPD , congestive heart failure , smoking , malignancy etc. , predictive re-admittance hospital mortality . ( C ) Examine prognostic value potential predictor relation all-cause mortality adult patient hospitalized CAP . Design : Prospective observational study inclusion 270 adult patient 3-year period , require admission pneumonia community hospital setting . Clinical biochemical data record longitudinally inclusion , stable clinical situation 6 week , mortality need re-admission within 12 month . Patients examine systematically , use modern research method explore relevant microbe . At point , blood test sample clinical-chemical analysis , DNA , RNA immunological analysis . Application : A translational research approach ambition elucidate new pathogenic mechanism could lead new diagnostic tool treatment modality . This possibly lead less drug exposure unnecessary hospitalization positive consequence patient medical care cost .</detailed_description>
