	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 ) integrase inhibitor currently Phase 3 clinical development treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Co-infection Hepatitis C ( HCV ) common HIV-infected subject therefore expect DTG coadministered treatment HCV . Boceprevir ( BCV ) Telaprevir ( TVR ) protease inhibitor treatment HCV recently approve Food Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency ( FDA/EMA ) rapidly adopt `` standard care '' combination pegylated interferon ribavarin . This single-center , open-label , two-cohort , two-period , one-way , study healthy adult subject . A total approximately 32 subject enrol , order obtain 24 evaluable subject ( 12 per cohort ) . In first treatment period , subject receive DTG 50 mg daily 5 day ( treatment A ) . In period 2 , subject receive DTG 50 mg daily plus either BCV 800 mg q8h ( treatment B ) 10 day TVR 750 mg q8h ( treatment C ) 10 day . There washout treatment . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . Subjects screen visit within 30 day prior first dose study drug , two treatment period , follow-up visit 7-14 day last dose study drug . This study conduct one center US , healthy adult male female subject .</brief_summary>
