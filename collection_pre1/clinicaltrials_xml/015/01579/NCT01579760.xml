	<brief_title>Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection Radiation Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation retinopathy cause decrease vision patient receive either external beam radiation local plaque therapy eye . An early manifestation radiation retinopathy macular edema , represent fluid within retina affect central vision . There currently approve treatment disease , although anecdotal report benefit laser photocoagulation , intravitreal anti-VEGF agent , intravitreal steroid use . This phase 1 study evaluate aflibercept treatment macular edema associate retinopathy secondary previous radiation treatment .</detailed_description>
