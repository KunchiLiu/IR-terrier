	<brief_summary>HepQuant test new liver test develop accurately measure liver function sensitivity specificity safe non-invasive . The primary goal study define intra-individual reproducibility HepQuant test , , see person give test several time test result essentially time . Subjects study include healthy control patient chronic liver disease . The chronic liver disease include hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection serious form fatty liver disease , know non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . The HCV NASH patient include men woman , early stage late stage liver disease define amount fibrosis observe liver biopsy . Once subject enrol study give HepQuant test three separate day within span one month . The hypothesis study HepQuant test reproducibly report liver function healthy control patient stage chronic HCV NASH liver disease liver function decrease amount liver fibrosis increase chronic liver disease patient .</brief_summary>
