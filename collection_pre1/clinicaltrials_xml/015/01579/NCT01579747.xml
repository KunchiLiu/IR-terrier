	<brief_title>Does Ultrasound Improve Procedural Time Lateral Popliteal Approach Sciatic Nerve Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single blind randomize control trial compare procedural time sciatic nerve block via lateral popliteal approach use ultrasound compare nerve stimulation . 24 patient randomly select determine patient receive sciatic block use ultrasound nerve stimulation technique . Patients choose receive ultrasound technique block perform attend regional anesthesiologist expert ultrasound guide sciatic nerve block via lateral popliteal approach . Patients choose receive nerve stimulation technique block perform attend regional anesthesiologist expert nerve stimulation sciatic nerve block via lateral popliteal approach . Blinding : Both patient person assess block blind group allocation . The high pain score procedure obtain observer blind group allocation . The time take block , number skin puncture number pass record person perform block . All popliteal block perform preoperatively 1 4 staff anesthesiologist substantial expertise peripheral nerve localization technique . Patients supine position bolster calf keep tibia parallel floor . This allow placement ultrasound probe popliteal region ultrasound group . An ultrasound machine nerve stimulator set group patient blind technique use nerve localization . The ultrasound machine turn placed perpendicular anesthesiologist perform block opposite side leg block . The nerve stimulator turn ground lead place side leg block group . The anesthesiologist perform block give allocation set system prior commencement block . The patient sedate 2-5mg midazolam 50-200 ug fentanyl achieve anxiolysis maintain verbal contact . A screen set prevent patient person assess block see block ultrasound screen . Nerve stimulation group : Time block performance start first palpation landmarks final injection local anesthetic . The site needle insertion identify mark ( Surgical Skin Marker VX100 ; Vio Healthcare , Hailsham , East Sussex , UK ) groove biceps femoris vastus lateralis muscle 10 cm top patella . ( 4 ) A 22G 80mm ( SonoPlex Stim Cannula Pajunk Medizintechnologie Germany ) insulate needle inserted nerve stimulator set 1.0mA . The needle inserted perpendicular skin redirect 30 degree angle relative horizontal plane . The needle depth estimate use midpoint thigh tangential trajectory 30 degree . If plantar flexion elicit , nerve stimulator dial produce stimulation 0.4mA less . If stimulation persist 0.2mA , needle withdrawn stimulation disappear 0.2mA persists 0.4mA . If dorsiflexion elicit , needle insert deep achieve plantarflexion . Internal rotation leg may help achieve angulation . ( 4 ) If needle achieve stimulation , needle redirect 5 degree increment 15 45 degree trajectory . ( 5 ) When needle correct position , 20 cc 1.5 % mepivacaine inject 5 cc increment 30 second . Aspiration blood perform injection every 5 cc injection . Injection stop blood aspirate pain injection . The needle repositioned block abandon discretion anesthesiologist block . However , blood aspiration pain note . Ultrasound group Time block performance start first antiseptic skin prep patient final injection local anesthetic . The lateral posterior portion thigh prepped chlorhexidine . The ultrasound probe cover sterile dressing place popliteal fossa close popliteal crease . The tibial common peroneal nerve identify . A long axis slide cephalad direction perform identify unity tibial common peroneal nerve sciatic nerve . The 28 mm high frequency ultrasound probe move 2 cm cephalad level needle insertion . The 22G 80mm ( SonoPlex Stim Cannula Pajunk Medizintechnologie Germany ) needle insert in-plane lateral thigh approach sciatic nerve . ( 6 ) 20 cc 1.5 % mepivacaine inject 5 cc increment 30 second . Aspiration blood perform injection every 5 cc injection . Circumferential spread local anesthetic around nerve seek . The needle redirect required achieve goal . Injection stop blood aspirate pain injection . The needle repositioned block abandon discretion anesthesiologist block . However , blood aspiration pain note . Block Evaluation After placement block , tibial ( bottom foot ) common peroneal ( top foot ) assess motor sensory loss . Motor loss grade : 0= motor strength ; 1 = loss , 2 = full strength . use ice PVC glove every 5 minute 30 minute . Sensory loss grade : 0 = sensation ice ; 1 = loss ; 2= complete sensation ice . If block produce complete sensory loss distribution within 30 minute , block define failure . It discretion anesthesiologist wish perform rescue block supplement local field block perform general anesthesia . Other Evaluation Patients follow recovery evaluate general anesthetic supplemental local anesthetic surgeon require sciatic distribution surgery . Patients follow within 72 hour via telephone interview regard sign symptom infection nerve damage .</detailed_description>
