	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety study drug LDE225 different dose level . The investigator test three different dose level dose depend patient enters study dose test time . At time , investigator also test safety LDE225 combination etoposide cisplatin . The investigator also want learn manage side effect patient may develop chemotherapy . Cancer patient may develop side effect treatment , nausea , pain , fatigue , diarrhea , constipation , shortness breath . These symptom may due cancer , due treatment . Doctors nurse often ask patient symptom , important part cancer treatment make patient feel well possible . If patient feel well , investigator may need change way treat patient prescribe therapy decrease symptom . The best way find patient feeling ask directly . The investigator interested develop new way ask patient feel , use Internet . A special new website call STAR ( `` Symptom Tracking Reporting Patients '' ) develop help patient record information , doctor nurse review clinic appointment . This study design help u see STAR helpful way u keep track information patient ' symptom quality life . The information STAR go place secure Internet site . This provide doctor information need determine drug combination safe enough whether continue .</brief_summary>
