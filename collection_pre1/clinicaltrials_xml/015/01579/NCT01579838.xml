	<brief_summary>The investigator identify patient CD59 deficiency suffers chronic hemolysis peripheral demyelinate disease . It show complement terminal pathway cause inflammation peripheral nervous system . Complement greatly increase immune attack nerve . Eculizumab already show effective rare blood disorder know paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) . Attacks PNH also mediate complement . Therefore , investigator study investigate whether 'turning ' complement CD59 deficiency , attack hemolysis nerve injury avoid whether neurological status ameliorate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Study Effects Eculizumab CD59 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show scientific study lack CD59 context disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) lead chronic hemolysis . The investigator identify patient wirh CD59 deficiency suffers chronic hemolysis demyelinate disease . It show complement terminal pathway cause cause inflammation nervous system . Complement greatly increase immune attack nerve . Eculizumab already show effective rare blood disorder know PNH . Attacks PNH also mediate complement . Therefore , investigator study investigate whether 'turning ' complement CD59 deficiency , attack hemolysis nerve injury avoid . The primary ( important ) objective study determine : Whether Eculizumab ameliorate neurological condition document last month treatment whether reduces relapse frequency patient relapse chronic inflammatory demyilinating polyneuropathy . The number attack one year treatment period compare number attack occur prior initiation eculizumab treatment . For patient 2 year disease duration , average number attack precede 2 year calculate . For patient le 2 year disease duration number attack precede year use . Whether Eculizumab reduce chronic hemolysis judge LDH level , haptoglobin , level hemoglobin . corticosteroid I.V . IgG consumption treatment eculizumab . The safety profile eculizumab patient CD59 deficiency determine parent report evry week , documentation clinic referral hospitalization . The number participant advers event determine . The secondary objective determine : Whether eculizumab maintain improve limbs motion , function quality life measure variety establish disability scale like modify SF36 like questionaire develop age group . The investigator also assess severity individual attack degree recovery . How drug behave patient 's blood measuring presence membrane attack complex neutrophil red blood cell .</detailed_description>
