	<brief_summary>Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy ( TAO ) , also call Graves ' ophthalmopathy thyroid eye disease , common orbital disease adult . Patients TAO , especially active phase , often complain symptom ocular surface discomfort , include excess tearing , gritty sensation , increased sensitivity light foreign-body sensation , similar inflammatory ocular surface disorder dry-eye syndrome ( DES ) . Incomplete blink , increase proptosis great palpebral fissure width TAO accelerate tear evaporation , increase tear fluid 's osmolarity , result ocular surface damage . The administration intravenous glucocorticoid effective treatment TAO . The rationale present study assess effect intravenously administer glucocorticoid sign DES patient TAO new method measurement tear film thickness , tear film osmolarity scatter tear film well establish method assessment severity DES . Additionally , impression cytology determination tear cytokines/chemokines perform obtain information inflammatory process ocular surface .</brief_summary>
