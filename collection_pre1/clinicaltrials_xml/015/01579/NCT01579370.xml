	<brief_summary>Enhanced terminal room disinfection novel , promising , still unproven strategy prevention healthcare-associated infection ( HAIs ) due select multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) bacterial pathogen . The investigator perform large prospective , multicenter study enhance terminal room disinfection 1 ) determine efficacy feasibility enhance terminal room disinfection strategy prevent HAIs 2 ) determine impact environmental contamination acquisition MDR-pathogens among hospitalized patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Enhanced Terminal Room Disinfection Prevent Healthcare-associated Infections ( HAIs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meticulous consistent use hand hygiene patient care remain cornerstone infection prevention health care setting . However , clean hand sufficient prevent healthcare-associated infection ( HAIs ) , 1 ) hand healthcare worker easily become contaminated contact contaminate environmental surface patient room appropriate hand hygiene perform direct patient care 2 ) direct contact patient preexist contaminated environmental surface hospital room lead colonization infection . Thus , novel strategy need prevent HAIs , particularly cause multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) pathogens persist environment methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin-resistant Enterococci ( VRE ) , Clostridium difficile , Acinetobacter . Enhanced environmental disinfection method may lead reduce risk exposure acquisition HAIs MDR-pathogens overcome critical issue face healthcare today - hospital room often poorly clean disinfect . Enhanced terminal room disinfection strategy use bleach and/or UV-C emitting device investigate experimental condition ; efficacy , effectiveness , feasibility enhance terminal room disinfection prevent HAIs unknown . Thus , scientific evidence intervention currently insufficient inclusion evidence-based guideline . This study investigate hypothesis enhance terminal room disinfection protocol ( use chlorine-based cleaning agent without UV-C light-emitting device ) decrease overall risk HAIs hospital , specifically , subsequent patient care room . This prospective investigation employ crossover design utilize four room cleaning/disinfection protocols 9 hospital , include 2 tertiary care , 1 VA , 6 community hospital . Phase T2 data study useful assess clinical efficacy feasibility individual disinfection strategy . Thus , goal investigator propose research 1 ) determine efficacy feasibility enhance terminal room disinfection strategy prevent HAIs 2 ) determine impact environmental contamination acquisition MDR-pathogens among hospitalized patient .</detailed_description>
