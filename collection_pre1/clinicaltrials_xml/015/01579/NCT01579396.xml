	<brief_summary>A high cut dialyzer ( septeX ) test patient cardio-thoracic surgery incidence `` systemic inflammatory response syndrome '' ( SIRS ) associate increase risk acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Hypothesis : The high cut dialyzer ( septeX ) increase postoperative IL-6/Il-10 ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Cut Off Dialysis Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Patients After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery associate systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) play important pathophysiological role development AKI patient cardiothoracic surgery . Previous study show elimination inflammatory mediator either achieve Continuous Venous Venous Hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) Continuous Venous Venous Hemofiltration ( CVVH ) use high-cutoff ( HCO ) membrane cut-off 45kD . Data patient treat HCO-CVVHD septic shock show reduction systemic cytokine improve hemodynamics . No data effect early HCO-CVVH cardiac surgery patient high risk Cardiac Surgery associate AKI consequently high rate postoperative renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) available . It note patient Euroscore &gt; 6 high risk develop SIRS associate AKI . No pharmacological anti-inflammatory approach convincingly show prevent renal dysfunction patient .</detailed_description>
