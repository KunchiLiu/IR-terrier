	<brief_summary>The cervical spine commonly injure , account 53.4 % spinal injury . More 40 % spinal injury occur either C4 , C5 C6 level lead variable loss function upper extremity . Traditionally , patient sustain cervical spine injury follow 2 year ensure recovery stabilized offering upper extremity reconstruction . This type reconstruction include active muscle transfer , tendon transfer joint fusion . Patients commonly assess immediately time injury . Muscle test commonly perform use Medical Research Grading System ( MRC ) . Although complete neurologic stabilization may complete 2 year post-injury , group initial grade 0 muscle strength acute phase injury , expectation improve muscle strength beyond grade 3 4-6 month minimal . And grade 3 muscle strength felt minimum useful functional strength muscle group . The investigator propose early nerve reconstruction approach tetraplegic patient dysfunction upper extremity augment available tendon transfer . A comparative pilot study propose determine effectiveness supinator branch posterior interosseous nerve ( PIN ) transfer 5 patient cervical spine injury . Patient fit inclusion criterion offer opportunity involve study review 6 month injury . If patient still regain Grade 3 power finger thumb extension , randomized surgical group non-surgical group . If informed consent obtain , surgery complete 6-9 month patient 's original cervical spine injury . The patient follow regular interval post-operatively expectation 18-24 month follow-up . Measures use pre post-operatively comparison . Measures include MRC muscle grade ( EDC ) , range motion , DASH , GRASSP ( Kalsi-Ryan , 2011 ) .</brief_summary>
