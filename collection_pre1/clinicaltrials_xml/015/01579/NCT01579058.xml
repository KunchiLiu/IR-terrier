	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis ( AS ) gradually progressive disease , characterized increase calcium deposition lead progressive narrowing aortic valve ( AV ) . There currently effective medical treatment halt disease process surgical valve replacement remain proven therapy valve become severely stenotic . AS mediated chronic inflammatory disease process , similar see atherosclerosis , lipid-lowering therapy slow progression AS SALTIRE , SEAS , ASTRONOMER trial . It possible trial may target patient disease advanced lipid-lowering therapy effective , atherosclerotic mechanism central pathogenic process AS . Because identify treat patient earlier stage AS would cost-effective , seem logical explore alternative pharmacological approach . AS thought degenerative process basically induce long-lasting mechanical stress , hemodynamic factor shear force , acceleration blood flow , hypertension rapid heart rate might contribute progression AS . Peak aortic jet velocity know associated clinical outcome mild moderate AS , previous study show rate progression significantly associate baseline aortic jet velocity mild AS . Because beta-blocker therapy would decrease aortic jet velocity heart rate , might decrease hemodynamic stress eventually slow degenerative process patient whose disease advance therapy effective . In retrospective , observational study , beta-blocker therapy associate favorable clinical outcome AS . The investigator hypothesize bisoprolol , new generation beta-blocker , would decrease rate progression AS modify hemodynamic factor favorably patient mild moderate AS .</detailed_description>
