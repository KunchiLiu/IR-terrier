	<brief_summary>Background : - People writer cramp develop tightness arm muscle abnormal hand posture writing , make write difficult impossible . At present , suitable rating scale measure symptom disability associate writer cramp . Researchers want videotape people perform simple writing task . They compare performance people writer cramp task people without writer cramp . This information help develop rating scale evaluate writer cramp . Objectives : - To develop new rating scale writer cramp . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age writer cramp . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants one outpatient study visit last 3 hour . - Participants perform task related writing , write passage draw spiral loop . They videotape task . They repeat write task three time ; paper attach write tablet , directly write tablet , computer tablet . - The angle make joint measured rest write healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Writer cramp ( WC ) cause significant discomfort disability afflict condition . Studies WC hamper lack objective , validate rating scale . In study , test validate new instrument rate WC ; WC impairment scale ( WCIS ) new disability scale ( WCDS ) .We also collect exploratory data biomechanics hand . Study population : The study population consist 20 subject . Ten patient WC 10 age handedness match HVs constitute study population . Design : 10 patient WC 10 age- handedness-matched HV videotape write . The WCIS score give subject four blind raters ( Drs . Mark Hallett , Barbara Karp , Katherine Alter , Camilo Toro ) base video . The patient complete WCDS . In addition , individual ask repeat basic element scale write screen tablet PC , surface detach digitize tablet order generate high temporal spatial resolution pen tip position sample numerical analysis score . The biomechanics hand measure use publish scale . Outcome measure : Using WCIS , inter intra-rater reliability , internal consistency ( Cronbach alpha ) face validity , reproducibility measure addition secondary outcome . The ease use raters assess subject . Reproducibility write tablet , write paper place write tablet , write tablet PC assess . Finally , biomechanics hand patient WC compare unaffected healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion patient WC age handednessmatched HVs : Subjects must least 18 year age . Subjects must willing videotape write . Subjects must regular hand function ability write without assistive device EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients WC : Botulinum toxin ( BTX ) administration within 3 month participation . Unable provide consent . Patients take oral medication WC include muscle relaxant centrallyactive medication antidepressant may enhance tremor . Medical condition affect hand function , stroke , nerve entrapment , tremor , parkinsonism , chorea , ataxia affect dominant hand . HVs : Unable provide consent . Healthy volunteer take oral medication may affect motor function muscle relaxant centrallyactive medication include medication psychiatric condition like antidepressant antipsychotic . Healthy volunteer abnormal hand function include medical condition may influence hand function , e.g. , stroke , nerve entrapment , tremor , parkinsonism , chorea , ataxia psychiatric condition ( psychosis depression ) affect dominant hand . Have history hand surgery hand trauma . Have abnormal finding medical history physical exam .</criteria>
