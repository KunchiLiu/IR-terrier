	<brief_summary>The following two objective propose healthy subject characterize ( 1 ) wound closure , ( 2 ) scar formation/appearance , ( 3 ) inflammatory response : Objective 1 , ( topical - refer `` TOP '' ) - Topical application Tocotrienol ( TCT ) v placebo bilateral punch biopsy Objective 2 , ( oral topical - refer `` OTOP '' ) - Combined oral supplementation topical application tocotrienol ( TCT ) v placebo bilateral punch biopsy Objective 3 , ( topical - refer `` TAM '' ) - Topical application tamoxifen v placebo bilateral punch biopsy . Objective 4 , ( topical normal skin ) - Topical application TCT v placebo bilateral let normal skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Of Tocotrienol Natural Vitamin E In Biopsy Wound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In nature , vitamin E family split two class : tocopherol ( TCP ) tocotrienols ( TCT ) . Members TCP TCT family biologically unique . - TCP mainly find green leafy vegetable TCT primary vitamin E seed , include cereal grain wheat , rice , barley . - Vitamin E think improve wound heal inhibit collagen synthesis attenuate fibroblast proliferation inflammation . However , outcome base scientific literature therapeutic efficacy vitamin E skin wound closure scant primarily focus TCP . - Oral supplementation TCP show modest improvement rodent wound closure , relevance oral TCP supplementation rat already receive high dose vitamin E standard laboratory questionable . - Topical TCP surgical wound child show improve wound healing ; yet mechanistic basis observe effect described . - Preliminary observation PI 's active IRB protocol test TCT scar appearance surgical wound lead u evaluate potential TCT vitamin E improve wound closure healthy subject . To date , therapeutic efficacy TCT either topical ( TOP ) oral topical ( OTOP ) application skin wound healing remains report . - Preliminary observation also make show down-regulation microRNA-200b support cutaneous angiogenesis , important step cutaneous wound heal . Tamoxifen silence mircroRNA-200b late work recognize non-neoplastic condition , tamoxifen may induce angiogenesis .</detailed_description>
