	<brief_title>Study Telomerase Vaccine GV1001 Treat Patients With Inoperable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer ( small cell non-small cell ) second common cancer men ( prostate cancer ) woman ( breast cancer ) . It account 15 % new cancer . Lung cancer world 's leading cause cancer death 1.6 million new case diagnose year . About 85 percent lung cancer patient Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) usually diagnose advanced disease treatment option low survival rate . Radiotherapy treatment choice successful treatment stage III NSCLC . However , 5-year survival stage III patient treat radiotherapy alone less 10 % . Several type chemotherapy treatment investigate , however , progress limit . Most patient die relapsed disease . The peptide telomerase vaccine , GV1001 , development use active immunotherapy treatment cancer . Normally , immune system tolerant self-proteins peptide , able react foreign pathogen . However , cancer cell degenerate cell many peptide protein self-proteins peptide . By use vaccination , immune tolerance towards specific peptide protein circumvent .</detailed_description>
