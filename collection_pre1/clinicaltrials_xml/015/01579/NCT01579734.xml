	<brief_title>Phase III , Randomized , Double Blind Trial Low Dose Tamoxifen Versus Placebo Hormone Replacement Therapy ( HRT ) Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While life expectancy grow approximately 30 year last century western country , age menopause increase 2-3 year . Thus , woman expose postmenopausal symptom disorder related estrogen drop considerable period lifetime . The management frequent disorder important public health issue . Although recent data WHI randomize trial demonstrate late postmenopausal woman ( mean age 63.3 year ) take oral conjugate equine estrogens medroxyprogesterone acetate continuous combine regimen prevention coronary heart disease increase risk develop cardiovascular disease breast cancer , question treatment menopausal symptom HRT ( Hormone Replacement Therapy ) young woman age around 50 year clinically beneficial treatment . This even truer woman enter menopause earlier 45 year . It prudent extend result WHI trial , , form HRT preparation , route , dosage regimens early postmenopausal woman apparent risk factor CVD . Recently data non-randomized study , Million Women Study , suggest oral combine regimen associate increase transdermal estradiol increase oral treatment , general may less harmful : instance , transdermal estradiol effect vascular inflammatory marker contrast increase observe oral CEE ( conjugate equine estrogen ) . Notably , recent data estrogens-alone group WHI trial show lower breast cancer risk combination , suggest important role progestin risk , significant reduction colon cancer . The increase risk develop breast cancer , mostly estrogens receptor positive , particularly combination estrogens progestin , associate increased expression estrogens receptor healthy breast tissue , thus lead enhanced sensitivity estrogens signal . Moreover , reproductive factor early menarche delayed pregnancy also associate high risk estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive breast cancer . Thus , addition SERM may reduce hormone growth-promoting effect breast gland . Tamoxifen investigate four large cooperative phase III trial breast cancer prevention at-risk woman . While preliminary result Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study hysterectomized woman show difference arm , recent update 7 year follow-up suggest combination HRT tamoxifen favorable effect might even synergistic . At mean observation time 81 month , 25 % reduction breast cancer note tamoxifen arm compare placebo ( 45 versus 34 event , Hazard Ratio , HR= 0.75 , 95 % CI , 0.48-1.18 ) . While difference subset woman never take HRT trial ( HR=1.01 , 95 % CI , 0.60-1.70 ) , woman , point study , ever take HRT ( n=1584 ) few breast cancer tamoxifen arm ( 6 tamoxifen versus 17 placebo , HR=0.35 , 95 % CI , 0.14-0.89 ) . Among woman continuously HRT trial ( n= 754 ) , breast cancer event 3 woman tamoxifen versus 11 placebo , respectively ( HR=0.30 , 95 % CI , 0.08-1.06 ) . Notably , 76.9 % HRT user receive transdermal unopposed ERT 6.5 % take transdermal ERT combine progestin . Importantly , recent result IBIS I trial indicate evidence HRT use affect tamoxifen benefit . Recent study suggest standard dose tamoxifen may reduce one quarter ( 5 mg day ) without significant loss beneficial effect circulate biomarkers , mostly reflect cardiovascular risk . Moreover , efficacy dos low one twentieth standard 20 mg/day dose breast cancer cell proliferation recently show . Since endometrial effect tamoxifen dependent treatment duration dose , dose reduction might reduce risk endometrial malignancy , retain preventive efficacy . On hand , addition HRT containing progestin could minimize risk endometrial cancer associate tamoxifen . Moreover , estrogen reduce incidence vasomotor uro-genital symptom , major reason tamoxifen withdrawal prevention study . In NSABP trial , woman age 50 younger demonstrate significantly increase incidence severe adverse event , include endometrial cancer , even importantly , venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) . One possible explanation lack severe toxicity premenopausal woman concomitant presence adequate circulate estrogen level prevent tamoxifen act estrogen agonist target tissue . Notably , IBIS I trial , significant excess endometrial cancer VTE note woman HRT allocate tamoxifen compare placebo . The background provide rationale phase III chemoprevention trial postmenopausal healthy woman HRT user Tamoxifen : HOT Study ( Hormone replacement therapy Opposed low dose Tamoxifen ) .</detailed_description>
