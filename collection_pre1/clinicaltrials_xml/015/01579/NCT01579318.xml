	<detailed_description>This single arm , open label , multi-center phase 2 study assess safety anti-tumor activity intratumoral pIL-12 electroporation subject stage IB IIIB mycosis fungoides . All subject may receive six cycle treatment consist two treatment day , Days 1 8 , 28-day cycle . Patients receive intratumoral injection pIL-12 concentration 0.5 mg/mL fix volume 0.25 mL per 1.0 cm diameter target region , follow immediately electrical discharge around tumor site result electroporation plasmid DNA tumor cell . Up maximum 8 fixed volume injection follow electroporation may administer day treatment total number dependent upon size individual lesion , affect area erythrodermic patient . Prior first cycle treatment , investigator select least one lesion , affect area erythrodermic patient , leave untreated duration study allow clinical observation untreated site . Subjects follow safety clinical evaluation every 4 week . Quality Life assess use Skindex29 , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - General ( FACT-G ) Visual Analog Scale Pruritus ( VAS-P ) instrument . Survival follow occur 3-month interval 2 year follow end study .</detailed_description>
