	<brief_summary>The study multi-center , prospective , randomize , single-blinded , placebo-controlled Phase II trial Herceptin + NeuVax ( TM ) vaccine ( E75 peptide/granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulate factor ) ( GM-CSF ) versus Herceptin + GM-CSF alone . The target study population node-positive ( NP ) ( node-negative [ NN ] negative ER PR ) breast cancer patient HER2 1+ 2+ express tumor disease-free standard care therapy . Disease-free subject standard care multi-modality therapy screen HLA-typed . E75 CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine restrict HLA-A2+ HLA-A3+ patient ( approximately two-thirds US population ) , extend HLA-A24+ HLA-A26+ well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Immunotherapy With Herceptin HER2 Vaccine NeuVax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator intend assess ability combination Herceptin NeuVax vaccine ( HER2 protein E75 peptide administer immunoadjuvant GM-CSF ) give adjuvant set prevent recurrence NP ( NN negative estrogen ( ER ) progesterone ( PR ) receptor ) breast cancer patient tumor express low ( 1+ ) intermediate ( 2+ ) level HER2 . Enrolled patient randomized receive Herceptin NeuVax vaccine Herceptin GM-CSF alone ( NeuVax vaccine ) . The safety combination therapy document , specifically ensure additive cardiac toxicity result combination HER2-directed therapy . Efficacy document compare DFS immunological response treatment group . The primary efficacy endpoint compare DFS 24 month treatment group . The primary safety issue prove additive cardiac toxicity combination HER2-directed therapy . A secondary endpoint trial compare DFS 36 month . Immunologic responses vaccine also document correlated clinical benefit . The study multi-center , prospective , randomize , single-blinded , placebo-controlled Phase II trial Herceptin + NeuVax vaccine versus Herceptin + GM-CSF alone . The target study population NP ( NN negative ER PR ) breast cancer patient HER2 1+ 2+ express tumor disease-free standard care therapy . Disease-free subject standard care multi-modality therapy screen HLA-typed . E75 CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine restrict HLA-A2+ HLA-A3+ patient ( approximately two-thirds US population ) , extend HLA-A24+ HLA-A26+ well . HLA-A2+/A3+/A24+/or A26+ patient meet eligibility criterion randomize receive Herceptin + NeuVax vaccine Herceptin + GM-CSF alone . For group , Herceptin give every three week monotherapy one year , give upon completion standard care chemotherapy/radiotherapy . The first Herceptin infusion must give sooner three week later 12 week completion chemotherapy/radiotherapy . Herceptin dose recommended initial load dose 8 mg/kg recommend maintenance dos 6 mg/kg q3wk . Herceptin administer described Section 4.3 . Patients randomize NeuVax vaccine arm receive vaccination E75 peptide ( 1000 mcg ) GM-CSF ( 250 mcg ) administer intradermally every three week six total vaccination , 30-120 minute completion Herceptin infusion . The NeuVax vaccine series begin immediately completion third Herceptin infusion . In extenuate circumstance , first vaccination may delay fourth fifth Herceptin infusion prior approval Principal Investigator . Those patient randomize GM-CSF alone arm receive vaccination GM-CSF ( 250 mcg ) administer identical manner receive NeuVax vaccine . Patients blind whether receive NeuVax vaccine GM-CSF alone . Upon completion vaccination series , booster inoculation ( dose route ) administer every six month x4 total combination ( Herceptin vaccine ) treatment duration 30 month . The first booster inoculation occur final Herceptin infusion , subsequent booster time every six month first booster . Booster inoculation occur patient randomized receive E75/GM-CSF well patient randomize receive GM-CSF alone , consist treatment drug dose ( i.e . E75/GM-CSF patient boost E75/GM-CSF GM-CSF alone patient boost GM-CSF alone ) . Patient blinding maintain throughout study . Subjects follow safety issue , immunologic response clinical recurrence . Patients monitor 48-72 hour inoculation reaction inoculation well documentation adverse effect experience . Immunologic response document vitro phenotypic functional assay well vivo delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction . All patient follow total 36 month document disease-free status . The investigator plan enroll 300 patient ( 150 treatment arm ) plan accrual rate 12 patient per month ( approximately one per study site per month ) . With accrual begin April , 2013 , enrollment last patient would expect August 2017 follow three-year follow-up period . The duration trial expect seven year .</detailed_description>
