Those previously diagnose treated contralateral breast cancer may enter . It recommend patient meet ECOG performance status 03 , however , grade 4 patient treated discretion participate center . Individual center may wish restrict entry exactly define subset patient case patient characteristic may enter particular center . For example , center may decide outset recruit woman age 50 possibly postmenopausal woman . Before enter patient trial , local investigator confirm patient would available regular followup least 5 year . Age &lt; 45 year Axillary lymph node positive breast cancer Invasive lobular cancer Tumor size &gt; 3.5 cm Extensive Intraductal Component ( EIC= &gt; 25 % lumpectomy specimen involve ductal carcinoma situ , DCIS ) assess surgical pathologic lumpectomy specimen Multicentric cancer breast diagnose clinical examination , mammography , ultrasound . MRI pathologic assessment , amenable excision negative margin single lumpectomy . Inability assess pathologic margin status Bilateral breast cancer time diagnosis . Ipsilateral breast previous cancer and/or prior infield radiation . Patients know BRCA1/2 gene mutation ( test gene mutation require ) . Patients undergoing primary systemic treatment ( hormone chemotherapy ) initial treatment neoadjuvant intent reduce tumor size . No 30 day elapse last breast cancer surgery ( axillary ) entry trial patient postpathology stratification .
