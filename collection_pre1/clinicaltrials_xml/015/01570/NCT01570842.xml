	<detailed_description>The investigator study 100 adult subject age 18 esophageal motility lab undergo clinically indicate 24 hour acidity basicity ( pH ) impedance and/or pH study acid suppress medication.. These subject prior history esophageal surgery , diagnosis BE . The investigator obtain consent take anthropometric measurement ( Waist hip circumference ) , result study . Only subject successfully complete 24 hour pH impedance study include . Subjects also undergo clinically indicate endoscopy . The investigator consent subject obtain 4 biopsy ( bx ) gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction 4 bx 5 cm GE junction . These bio-specimens store assessment tissue injury ( PGE2 ) tissue immune-histochemistry BE precursor ( CDX1 CDX2 ) later date .</detailed_description>
