	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate low rate emergence antibiotic resistance P. aeruginosa Acinetobacter spp treatment hospitalize patient pneumonia require mechanical ventilation treat PD optimize meropenem administer prolonged infusion combination parenteral aminoglycoside plus tobramycin inhalation ( Group 1 ) compare therapy meropenem alone ( Group 2 - control arm ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal clinical study demonstrate application pharmacodynamic dose principle antibiotic treatment hospitalized subject culture-documented pneumonia ( include HABP , VABP HCAP ) require mechanical ventilation inhibit emergence antibiotic-resistant organism treatment therefore may improve rate satisfactory clinical response . Antibiotic resistance define increase meropenem aminoglycoside MIC two tube dilution ( fourfold ) baseline . In animal model infection , pharmacodynamic driver bactericidal effect β lactam antibiotic meropenem proportion dose interval plasma drug level maintain MIC causative pathogen . The hypothesis study prolongation time MIC increase total meropenem dose duration infusion counter-select emergence antimicrobial resistance treatment hospitalize subject pneumonia ( i.e . HABP , VABP HCAP ) cause P.aeruginosa , Acinetobacter specie ( spp ) , pathogens intermediate susceptibility meropenem , addition parenteral aminoglycosides ( amikacin , tobramycin gentamicin ) nebulized aminoglycoside ( tobramycin ) give along optimal pharmacodynamic principle reduce likelihood resistance emergence , particularly among non-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa Acinetobacter spp . The observed incidence resistance emergence meropenem compare across therapeutic regimen .</detailed_description>
