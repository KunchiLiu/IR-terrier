	<brief_summary>Self-expanding metallic stent placement safe effective endoscopic procedure increasingly use relieve colonic obstruction . Fully covered metal stent ( FCSEMS ) plastic stent recently develop reduce hyperplastic ( non tumoral ) tumoral tissue ingrowth . These fully cover metal plastic stent several advantage non-covered stent , include possibility retrieval limit local tissue reaction , provide alleviation obstruction possibly low cost . Only report fully cover metal stent placement patient benign colorectal stricture available literature . The aim study ass effectiveness FCSEMS management colonic benign stricture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It national multicentric retrospective study use fully cover metal stent placement patient benign colorectal stricture . Consecutive patient 18 year age symptomatic benign colonic stricture despite optimal medical and/or endoscopic dilation therapy require use FCSEMS include . All stricture confirm benign histology . All detail concern previous history , origins treatment ( medical endoscopic ) colonic stenosis collect medical file . Senior endoscopists experience 50 colonic stent placement perform procedure general propofol-induced anesthesia technic ( The stent place fluoroscopic videoendoscopic control ) . Patients required procedure take oral osmotic laxative regularly . Post-stenting complication define immediate ( procedure ) , early ( occur â‰¤ 30 day ) late ( &gt; 30 day ) procedure . Stent removal routine follow endoscopy schedule 4 6 week placement patient earlier complication occur . All patient follow regular interval base clinical situation . A retrospective chart review perform analyze long-term outcome patient .</detailed_description>
