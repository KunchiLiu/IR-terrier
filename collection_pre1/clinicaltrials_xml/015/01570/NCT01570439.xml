	<brief_summary>Aim : To identify HLA-A1101-restricted peptide epitopes derive novel Oncoantigens ( URLC10 , KIF20A , CDCA1 ) applicable Cancer Vaccine Singapore . Methods : The panel candidate peptide synthesize tested ability induce peptide-specific CTL response , order screen peptide epitopes applicable cancer vaccination . Briefly , peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) derive HLA-A1101 ( + ) healthy donor take cultured presence candidate peptide recombinant IL-2 2 week , , re-stimulated dendritic cell pulse peptide follow another 2 week culture . Thereafter , CD8 ( + ) T lymphocytes negatively select CD4-magnetic bead culture lymphocyte test peptide specificity employ enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay . These condition completely perform in-vitro system . Importance medicine : If one could identify peptide epitope novel Oncoantigens , applicable clinical trial cancer vaccination . Benefits &amp; Risks : There risk except matter venipuncture individual . The ideal target molecule cancer vaccination think selectively express tumor cell , normal cell , high frequent homogenous expression within tumor . We prove novel Oncoantigens , URLC10 , KIF20A CDCA1 , character ideal target molecule cancer vaccination highly express variety tumor type gastric , lung , pancreas cancer . Since HLA-A1101 haplotype frequent Singaporean , essential indentify HLA-A1101-restriced peptide derive Oncoantigens develop cancer vaccination .</brief_summary>
