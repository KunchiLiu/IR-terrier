	<brief_summary>No sample size estimation methodology currently exist right-censored count data model . We expect less number attempt ultrasound group 20 % difference two group feel minimum clinically-relevant effect . At 0.05 level significance power 0.8 , require minimum 20 patient per group , therefore plan recruit 40 patient total . Patients consent receive spinal anesthesia ( oppose anesthetic technique ) meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study ( give ) randomize day surgery obtain inform consent either ultrasound-guided standard spinal anesthesia technique . A block randomization scheme random block size range 2-8 patient use . The outcome record third party observer block room/operating room might nurse resident clinical research fellow directly involve perform block . The post procedure outcomes also record clinical research fellow resident directly involve perform block . The analysis conduct statistician blind .</brief_summary>
