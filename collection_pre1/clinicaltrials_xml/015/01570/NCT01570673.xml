The pilot study compare standard individual teaching occur pediatric urology clinic bladder re-training achieve healthy bladder bowel habit group teach session . The group teach session one hour length include content taught pediatric urology clinic provide time child ask question , demonstrate practice different exercise talk challenge associate problem bladder . The group teach session approximately one hour length occur weekly evening 12 15 week . Study participant ask attend either one group teach session one individual teaching session occur regular pediatric urology clinic . Parents ask complete demographic questionnaire start study child participant ask complete 2 short questionnaire symptoms quality life either individual group teach session . At 3 month follow , parent child participant also ask fill evaluation form session receive . Children age 6 10 year old diagnosis nonneurogenic low urinary tract dysfunction ask would like participate . Why ? Some symptom bladder dysfunction include incontinence ( wet ) , recurrent urinary tract infection , frequency ( pee lot ) urgency ( sudden urge pee ) . These symptom affect child 's physical emotional/mental well-being .

Children teach urinary tract system need improve maintain health . Children ask void ( pee ) every 2 hour , double void drink water . Sometimes also need take medication . Often busy clinic , parent teach child need expect return home implement bladder re-training instruction . Participation child visit varies . However , participation engagement child bladder re-training crucial success . Also , little time spend impact bladder dysfunction live child . Many child want follow instruction bladder re-training worried peer may say . What hope accomplish ? The purpose study assess feasibility group teach session evaluate preliminary effectiveness session . Questionnaire result compare teaching session individual group teach group . Evaluation form provide feedback teach session help determine strengths session improvement could make improve quality effectiveness future treatment .

	<detailed_description>Background Urotherapy standard nonsurgical , nonpharmacologic treatment child nonneurogenic low urinary tract dysfunction ( NLUTD ) dysfunctional elimination syndrome ( DES ) two decade ( Hoebeke , 2006 ) . Children NLUTD/DES represent heterogenous group whose physical mental health affect ( Afshar et al. , 2009 ) . There widely accept diagnostic criterion ( Afshar et al . ) urotherapy modality study vary setting , curriculum , length treatment , outcome measurement study participant . It challenge determine modality urotherapy effective review current literature . Furthermore , quality life outcome measurement urotherapy report literature . Purpose The purpose study assess feasibility group urotherapy session evaluate preliminary effectiveness group urotherapy session measure NLUTD/DES symptom quality life compare group urotherapy session standard urotherapy take place pediatric urology clinic . Methods Children age 6-10 year old diagnose NLUTD/DES recruit pediatric urology clinic McMaster Children 's Hospital 12 15 week . The aim recruit least 60 participant , 30 randomize control group receive standard individual urotherapy clinic 30 randomized experimental group receive 1 hour group urotherapy session . Parents ask complete demographic questionnaire time consent child ask complete 2 questionnaire time consent 3 month receive either individual group urotherapy . At 3 month follow , parent participant ask complete evaluation form provide feedback teach session receive . Outcome Measurements NLUTD/DES symptom evaluate use Vancouver NLUTD/DES questionnaire . This questionnaire assess follow symptom : incontinence , urgency , frequency , dysuria , hesitancy , strain constipation . Quality life ( QOL ) measure use PinQ QOL measure . This questionnaire measure 6 domain QOL : social , self-esteem , family , body image , independence mental health . Both questionnaire deem valid reliable child diagnosis age study population . Impact This pilot study provide new knowledge control trial compare standard individual group urotherapy report literature . Urotherapy effective , search effective program continue . This pilot study provide information feasibility group urotherapy session well preliminary effectiveness . Furthermore , quality life outcome measure use evaluate urotherapy . Again , provide new valuable knowledge child 's perception condition effect urotherapy QOL . References Afshar , K. , Mirbagheri , A. , Scott , H. &amp; MacNeily , A.E . ( 2009 ) .
