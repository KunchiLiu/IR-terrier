	<brief_summary>The subject eligible trial type blood cell cancer , blood disease genetic disease receive stem cell transplant . The donor stem cell either subject 's brother sister , another relative , closely match unrelated donor . The Investigators ask subject participate study test blood cell subject 's donor grow special way , prevent effective treatment early infection five virus - Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , adenovirus , BK virus ( BKV ) human herpes virus 6 ( HHV6 ) . Adenovirus virus usually cause symptoms common cold , cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system . It affect lung cause serious pneumonia , also damage gut , liver , pancreas eye . CMV also cause serious infection patient weak suppressed immune system . It usually affect lung , cause serious pneumonia , also affect gut , liver eye . Approximately 2/3 normal people harbor virus body . In healthy people CMV rarely cause problem immune system keep control , transplant , risk develop CMV disease much high immune system weak . EBV virus cause glandular fever kiss disease . It also life long infection like CMV normally control immune system . When immunity weak , virus become active cause fever , enlarge lymph node sometimes type cancer call lymphoma . BKV virus usually cause symptoms common cold fever normally cause problem . If immune system weaken way , example follow bone marrow transplant , BKV cause life-threatening infection affect mainly kidney , bladder , urinary tract . HHV6 another virus infect people childhood cause symptom like fever , diarrhea rash . Like CMV , EBV , BKV , HHV6 remain body life cause problem immune system weaken . When occur virus affect many organ include brain , lung , heart , kidney gastrointestinal tract . The Investigators want see use kind white blood cell call T lymphocyte ( T cell ) prevent treat adenovirus , CMV , EBV , BKV HHV6 early stage reactivation infection . The Investigators grown T cell subject 's stem cell donor laboratory way train recognize virus control T cell give transplant . This treatment specially trained T cell ( also call cytotoxic T cell `` CTLs '' ) activity three virus ( CMV , EBV Adenovirus ) previous study . In study Investigators want see increase number virus target include BKV HHV6 use simple fast approach make cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ARMS - Rapidly Generated Multivirus-Specific CTLs Prophylaxis And Treatment EBV , CMV , Adenovirus , HHV6 , BK Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To make CTLs , subject 's donor ' cell mix small piece protein , call peptide come adenovirus , CMV , EBV , BKV HHV6 . These peptide stimulate donor T cell react virus grow train donor T cell kill cell infect CMV , EBV , adenovirus , BKV HHV6 . Once sufficient number T cell make , tested make sure would target cell infected virus normal cell . Then cell frozen . When Investigators think subject need , subject 's donor 's CTL cell thaw injected intravenous line . To prevent allergic reaction , prior receive CTLs subject may give diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) . After subject receives cell , Investigators monitor level five virus blood . They also take blood see long T cell give subject lasting body . If CTL infusion help subject infection treatment , example steroid drug might destroy T cell subject give , allow receive 2 dos cell . The first part study dose escalation study . That mean beginning , patient start low dose ( 1 3 different level ) T cell . The next group patient start high dose . This process continue 3 dose level study . They would like enroll patient high dose level get information T cell work . Subjects continue follow transplant doctor injection . The subject either see clinic contact research nurse follow study every week 6 week 8 week 3 , 6 12 month . The subject may visit standard care . Subjects also regular blood test do follow count viral infection . To learn way T cell work body , extra 30-40 ml ( 6-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 8 week 3 month . Blood come central intravenous line , require extra needle stick . If subject experience positive response take medicine ( steroid ) may affect long T cell stay body , may able receive two additional dos T cell initial dose level 28 day initial dose . After T-cell infusion , monitor describe . Study Duration : Subjects study approximately one year . If receive additional dos T cell describe , follow 1 year last dose T-cells .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible follow type allogeneic transplant receive CTLs prevention early reactivations define . 1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell within 12 month . 2 . Prevention patient risk CMV , adenovirus , EBV , BK virus , HHV6 infection 3 . Treatment reactivation infection define virus CMV CMV antigenemia monitor least weekly post transplant . Reactivation define CMV antigenemia &lt; 10 leukocyte positive elevate PCR . If patient develops CMV antigenemia &gt; 10 leukocyte positive clinical evidence CMV infection ( define demonstration CMV biopsy specimen visceral site ( culture histology ) either pre CTL infusion , standard treatment Ganciclovir , and/or Foscarnet Immunoglobulins initiate . Patients may receive CTLs antigenemia elevate PCR without visceral infection . Adenovirus Adenovirus infection define presence adenoviral positivity detect PCR culture ONE site stool blood urine nasopharynx . Adenovirus disease define presence adenoviral positivity detect culture two site stool blood urine nasopharynx . In patient meet criterion disease Cidofovir may add unless subject could tolerate agent due nephrotoxicity . Patients may receive CTLs elevate PCR blood stool . EBV EBVLPD define accord recent guideline proven EBVLPD define biopsy probable EBVLPD define elevate EBV DNA level associate clinical symptom ( adenopathy fever mass image ) without biopsy confirmation . Patients EBV DNA reactivation may receive CTLs study . Patients proven probable EBVLPD also receive Rituxan BK virus Patients post transplant may develop asymptomatic BKV viruria viremia . BK reactivation define detection elevate BK level PCR blood urine disease define detection multiple sit one site symptom . Cidofovir administer intravenously low dose ( i.e . 1 mg/kg 3 time weekly , without probenecid ) high dose ( ie , 5 mg/kg per week probenecid ) HSCT patient BK infection randomize trial available prove clinical efficacy . In patient meet criterion disease Cidofovir may add unless subject could tolerate agent due nephrotoxicity . HHV6 HHV6 reactivation define detection elevate HHV6 level PCR blood disease define detection multiple sit one site symptom . Ganciclovir , Cidofovir , foscarnet variable vitro activity HHV6 , may role treat HHV6associated disease hence one agent add patient disease . 4 . Treatment may give eligible patient single multiple infection . Patients multiple infection one reactivation one control infection eligible enroll . 5 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid le 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone . 6 . Karnofsky/Lansky score ≥ 50 7 . ANC great 500/µL . 8 . Bilirubin &lt; /= 2x upper limit normal 9 . AST &lt; /= 3 x upper limit normal 10 . Serum creatinine &lt; /= 2 x upper limit normal 11 . HgB &gt; 8.0 12 . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air 13 . Available multivirusspecific CTLs 14 . Negative pregnancy test female patient applicable ( childbearing potential receive reduced intensity condition regimen ) . 15 . Written inform consent and/or sign assent line patient , parent guardian . 1 . Patients receive ATG , Campath immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibody within 28 day screen enrollment . 2 . Patients uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 3 . Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day . 4 . Patients active acute GVHD grade IIIV . 5 .
