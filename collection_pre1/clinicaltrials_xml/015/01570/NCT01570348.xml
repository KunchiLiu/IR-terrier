	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give donor bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) work treat patient refractory Crohn 's Disease . We select patient severe Crohn 's Disease active inflammation despite best medical surgical treatment . These patient must healthy enough undergo transplantation procedure . They active infection , heart , lung , kidney , liver fail . The transplant procedure start chemotherapy small dose radiation , weaken patient 's immune system accept bone marrow cell another person . After person 's bone marrow cell give patient , immune suppressive medicine give prevent new cell reject stop cell damaging patient . After new donor cell start work , blood count rise new immune system start grow . During time , risk infection . Antibiotics anti-viral drug give prevent infection . When new donor cell well-established , immune suppressive medicine discontinue . We examine part intestine inflame start transplant procedure , sure Crohn 's Disease disappear transplant . Patients formally evaluate Crohn 's activity around 100 day transplant , yearly 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crohn 's Allogeneic Transplant Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There strong evidence genetic susceptibility Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) , environmental factor interact genetic polymorphism . Some patient remain refractory best available therapy . In patient intestinal inflammation relate genetic disorder , allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation lead disappearance inflammation , example , patient IPEX ( immune dysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy , X-linked ) mutation Interleukin-10 receptor , characterize severe , early onset , fistulating colitis transplantation therapy offer benefit . Eleven patient typical CD achieve allogeneic donor chimerism transplant resolution sign symptoms CD sustain 15 year . These case series suggest allogeneic transplantation substantial potential cure CD . HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS : The hypothesis : Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) achieve sustain remission patient refractory CD , do safely . The specific aim : 1 ) To evaluate safety efficacy allogeneic HCT treatment refractory CD . 2 ) To evaluate treatment effect CD activity/severity use Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) Simple Endoscopic Score CD ( SES-CD ) . 3 ) To evaluate safety score regimen-related toxicity , time engraftment , infectious complication , acute chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) , treatment-related mortality . 4 ) To evaluate effect quality life . METHODS : This study prospective single-arm Phase II clinical trial enroll 12 patient . PATIENT SELECTION : Patients document CD ( see eligibility criterion ) ; sign symptom fail respond satisfactorily medical surgical therapy ; active intestinal inflammation endoscopy histology , CDAI &gt; = 250 need total parenteral nutrition recurrent inflammation resection . Donors Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling unrelated donor . ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE : Patients receive reduced-intensity conditioning regimen cyclophosphamide , fludarabine low-dose Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) , regimen use successfully patient receive haploidentical allograft . Marrow use graft source reduce risk GVHD . GVHD prophylaxis consist post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide follow combination tacrolimus enteric coat mycophenolic acid . Supportive care include use N-acetyl cysteine infusion reduce risk sinusoidal liver injury cyclophosphamide ; prophylaxis ursodiol prevent cholestatic liver disease ; antimicrobial drug prophylaxis preemptive treatment infection bacteria , fungi , herpes virus , Pneumocystis jiroveci . Tissue blood sample archive future study evaluation immune reconstitution predefined interval . EFFICACY AND SAFETY ENDPOINTS : Safety efficacy base clinical assessment , laboratory testing , gastrointestinal endoscopy histology baseline , day 100 post-transplant , yearly 5 year . The primary endpoint event-free survival 1 year , define alive free active CD endoscopy biopsy . Transplant-related mortality death occur time start allogeneic HCT . Disease activity evaluate use CDAI . Quality Life measure use Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire . RISKS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS : The major risk include regimen-related toxicity , infection , graft rejection , GVHD . Autologous stem cell reserve case graft rejection . Recent advance transplant technique substantially reduce mortality risk . Balancing risk potential allogeneic transplant effect sustain remission cure CD . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective evaluate safety efficacy HCT treatment refractory CD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate treatment effect CD activity severity . II . To evaluate safety allogeneic HCT determine regimen-related toxicity , infectious complication , acute chronic GVHD , treatment-related mortality , overall total mortality , time engraftment . III . To evaluate effect allogeneic HCT quality life ( QOL ) patient severe refractory CD . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING THERAPY : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day -6 -2 cyclophosphamide IV 1-2 hour day -6 -5 . Patients undergo 200 cGy TBI day -1 . TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo allogeneic BMT day 0 . IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY : Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV 1-2 hour day 3-4 , tacrolimus IV daily orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 5-180 taper day 365 , mycophenolate acid enteric coat mycophenolate mofetil PO three time daily ( TID ) day 0-35 . After completion conditioning therapy infusion donor bone marrow cell , patient follow 1 month , 3 month , 12 month , yearly thereafter 60 month .</detailed_description>
