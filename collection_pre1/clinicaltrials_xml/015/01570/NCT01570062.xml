	<brief_summary>This study focus effect HEPA filtration reduce exposure combustion-derived air pollution ( CDAP ) . Specifically , study evaluate health benefit HEPA filter compare cardiovascular toxicity two major source CDAP , specifically traffic residential wood combustion . Specifically , purpose study evaluate ability portable high efficiency particle air ( HEPA ) filter reduce exposure PM2.5 air pollution indoors improve subclinical indicator microvascular function systemic inflammation among healthy adult participant . The investigator hypothesize HEPA filter use help decrease indoor concentration CDAP thereby help mitigate associate cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To address knowledge gap health risk specific pollution source provide new evidence health benefit air pollution intervention , objective study : 1 ) quantify relationship low-level exposure combustion-derived PM air pollution subclinical indicator cardiovascular disease risk ; 2 ) compare relative impact HEPA filtration two major PM source ( traffic residential wood combustion ) indicator . The use HEPA filter may help mitigate cardiovascular risk factor cause combustion-derived air pollution ( CDAP ) , ( specifically woodstove traffic emission ) . We hypothesize HEPA filter use improve woodstove technology help decrease indoor occurrence CDAP . This project help address knowledge gap CDAP-related health risk benefit intervention . Specific objective include establish relationship exposure CDAP biomarkers cardiovascular risk evaluate impact HEPA filter use towards improve indoor air quality health indicator .</detailed_description>
