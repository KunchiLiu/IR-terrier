	<detailed_description>Treatment AML patient chemotherapy SCT frequently complicate SI may represent obstacle antileukemic chemotherapy transplant program . Antimicrobial prophylaxis , diagnostic approach antimicrobial therapy adapt infectious risk leukemic population . A crucial problem definition strategy represent continuous change epidemiological pattern infection result modification risk factor leukemic population global epidemiology hospital community acquire infection . In particular , emergence antibiotic resistant pathogen , particularly among gram negative bacteria , represent serious problem dramatically impact antibacterial prophylaxis treatment choice . A continuous epidemiology survey require order well define proper prevention , diagnostic treatment approach . A common problem infection control immunocompromised population represent late epidemiological consciousness . In particular , new antileukemic strategy implement change infectious epidemiology frequently evidence later retrospectively , retrospective study suffer several drawback timely proper collection data . The aim AML1310 GIMEMA protocol prospectively evaluate large population newly diagnose young AML patient effect risk-adapted , MDR direct antileukemic strategy include chemotherapy SCT . The objective trial evaluate treatment strategy term OS 24 month secondary objective include response rate outcome accord clinical biological characteristic baseline along antileukemic treatment . A secondary objective AML1310 study evaluation quality life . A prospective , longitudinal survey infectious complication occur patient enrol AML1310 study along entire antileukemic program , ancillary observational study , may useful tool evaluate real-time epidemiological pattern infection , impact OS , antileukemic treatment schedule , quality life . First , may allow ass whether various type SI , addition well know clinical leukemia-related prognostic variable , actually independent prognostic factor long-term outcome AML patient . Second , result survey may offer precious indication timely update prophylaxis , diagnosis treatment strategy infection AML patient undergo modern antileukemic program . The advance treatment AML result AML1310 study may enrich epidemiological consciousness derive parallel survey infectious complication .</detailed_description>
