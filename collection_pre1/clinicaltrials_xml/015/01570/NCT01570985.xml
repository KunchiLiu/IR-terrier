	<brief_title>Treatment Study Frozen Shoulder : Corticosteroid Injection Joint Versus Wait See Policy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder capsulitis frozen shoulder painful condition cause limitation shoulder movement . Its incidence 2 % , comprise mostly woman . There need control trial frozen shoulder preferably general practice , without use technical guiding instrument injection MRI computer tomography , condition routinely treat general practice . It therefore important conduct study similar possible current practice . The procedure simple , safe less time consume . Patients allocate study group computerize block-randomization three permutation per block . Group 1 consist patient receive Triamcinolone 20 mg intraarticular injection Lidocaine 10mg/ml 3 ml total 4 ml solution . Group 2 patient receive intraarticular Triamcinolone 20 mg , 3 ml Lidocaine rest physiological natrium chloride 9 mg/ml , comprise total volume 8 ml upwards 20 ml . Group 3 serve control group patient group could receive treatment corticosteroid injection per oral corticosteroid medication . The control group remain without treatment corticosteroid , injection tablet form till 61 day , also last day outcome measurement . The time interval 1st 2nd treatment 7 day , 2nd 3rd treatment 10 day , 3rd 4th treatment 14 day . Patients also receive follow-up mail 6 12 month inclusion , pain function ( SPADI ) investigate . The patient explain instructed filling schema SPADI , NPRS , pain figure , sleep Bergen Insomnia Scale ( BIS ) , EPQ-N measure neuroticism , Subjective Health Complaints ( SHC ) .</detailed_description>
