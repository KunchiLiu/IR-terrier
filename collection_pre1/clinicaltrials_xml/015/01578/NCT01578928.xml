	<brief_title>A Phase l Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Safety Pasireotide Subjects With Varying Degrees Renal Impairment Compared Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , open-label , multicenter , single dose study evaluate PK safety pasireotide s.c. injection subject vary degree renal impairment compare healthy subject normal renal function . Subjects classify respective degree renal function ( normal , mild , moderate , severe , ESRD ( End Stage Renal Disease ) accord eGFR determine screen visit .</detailed_description>
