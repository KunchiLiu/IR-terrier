	<brief_title>Validation Digital-PCR Analysis Through Programmed Imatinib Interruption PCR Negative CML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit approximately 100 CML patient imatinib therapy complete molecular remission history least 18 month consecutive negative standard Q-RT-PCR perform center . After sign informed consent form ( ICF ) , patient test dPCR discontinue imatinib therapy . Then monitor standard Q-RT-PCR ass maintenance molecular remission ; collection data prospective center collect data 36 month . At end period , peripheral blood sample dPCR analysis obtain patient still undetectable BCR-ABL transcript Q-RT-PCR verify CML eradication . The maintenance molecular remission Q-RT-PCR survival monitor every six month additional follow-up 24 month . Patients find positive BCR-ABL transcript standard Q-RTPCR repeat test every 2 4 week loss molecular remission , define two consecutive BCR-ABL positive test least one BCR-ABL/BCR value 0.1 % , end study , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
