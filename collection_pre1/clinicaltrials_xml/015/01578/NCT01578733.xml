	<brief_summary>Minimal data available protein requirement throughout lifespan . Currently available recommendation base nitrogen balance data . The limitation nitrogen balance method well describe . Importantly , nitrogen balance underestimates requirement . The current DRI requirement healthy adult male base reanalysis nitrogen balance date Young Scrimshaw . This data reanalyzed statistically Rand et al . conclude protein requirement healthy adult 0.65 0.83 ( mean RDA ) g/kg/day good quality protein . Using IAAO , investigator group estimate protein requirement young men ( mean age 27 year ) 0.93 1.2 g/kg/day ( mean RDA ) . Currently study protein requirement elderly . In recent nutrition survey conduct NHANES , author conclude adult age 51 - 70 year old consume average 1.0 g/kg/day ( ideal body weight ) protein represent 15 % calorie . Depending calculation use ideal body weight old adult could get high low requirement . There scientifically derive protein estimate older adult . Therefore need measurer protein requirement population . The goal study therefore measure protein requirement female elderly subject age 65 - 70 year use IAAO technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Protein Requirement Elderly Female Subjects 65-75 Yrs Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Healthy elderly female age 65 75 &gt; 75 year 2 . Willingness participate study 3 . Females without chronic disease acute illness could affect protein AA metabolism eg , diabetes , cancer , liver kidney disease , HIV , acute cold flu , hypo hyperthyroidism , rheumatoid arthritis treat antiinflammatory medication . 4 . Females hypertension well control medication 1 . Presence disease know affect protein AA requirement synthesis like diabetes , cancer , liver kidney disease , HIV , acute cold flu , hypo hyperthyroidism , rheumatoid arthritis treat antiinflammatory medication . 2 . On medication know affect protein amino acid metabolism like e.g . steroid . 3 . Significant weight loss past month .</criteria>
