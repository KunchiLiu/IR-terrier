	<brief_title>The Effects Treating Obese Lean Patients With Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) independent risk factor insulin resistance , systemic hypertension cardiovascular disease . Both obesity OSA associate increased sympathetic activity , inflammatory activity , oxidative stress , presume mediator share clinical consequence . Due conflict result previous intervention study treat OSA patient CPAP , investigator still know treatment obese OSA patient substantial benefit risk factor . In Aim 1 , determine effect obesity response CPAP treatment OSA patient , investigator compare response daytime sleepiness , insulin resistance , arterial blood pressure follow CPAP treatment obese lean OSA patient , stratify amount abdominal visceral adipose tissue , fat depot associate increase sympathetic activity , inflammation , oxidative stress , powerful predictor BMI adverse cardiovascular metabolic outcome . Aim 2 determine effect CPAP treatment two patient group sympathetic activity , inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers . The overall hypothesis , adjust OSA severity obtain normative data non-OSA subject comparable amount visceral adiposity ( Aim 3 ) , two OSA group comparable improvement daytime sleepiness , cardiovascular metabolic improvement follow CPAP therapy decrease OSA patient increase visceral adipose tissue . The investigator anticipate , although great absolute change marker sympathetic activity , inflammation oxidative stress obese compare lean OSA patient follow CPAP treatment , level still abnormally high obese patient result decreased improvement insulin resistance , arterial blood pressure , vascular health obese versus lean OSA patient . Relevance : Obese patient increase risk develop sleep apnea . Both obesity sleep apnea felt increase risk diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease . The propose research begin determine treat obese patient sleep apnea help reduce risk . If beneficial effect CPAP treatment reduce obese compare lean patient sleep apnea , treatment sleep apnea obese patient need combine effective management obesity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 4065 year ; Will recruit postmenopausal woman hormone replacement therapy avoid potential confounding effect female hormone OSA prevalence severity , fat distribution well endpoint ( 5060 ) Lean subject need waist circumference score &lt; = 107 cm men &lt; = 96 cm woman . Obese subject need waist circumference score &gt; 107 cm men &gt; 96 cm woman For OSA volunteer , 15 ≤ AHI ≤ 75 ( see Preliminary Results justification upper limit ) fullnight inlaboratory polysomnogram within last 6 month . Stable medical history change medication , include antihypertensive lipidlowering medication , previous 2 month No regular daytime use ( &gt; 3 times/week ) sedative hypnotic medication last 2 month Arm circumference ≤ 50 cm ( manufacturer limit perform ambulatory BP recording ) Unable unwilling provide inform consent . Not satisfied reimbursement Time constraints No telephone access inability return follow testing . BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 . Diagnosis another sleep disorder addition OSA base PSG ( e.g. , periodic limb movement disorder [ ≥ 15 limb movements/hour sleep arousal ] , central sleep apnea [ ≥ 50 % apneas diagnostic PSG central apnea ] , insomnia , restless legs syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome , narcolepsy ) . Previous treatment positive airway pressure , home oxygen therapy , tracheotomy , uvulopalatopharyngoplasty , surgery OSA Requiring oxygen bilevel positive airway pressure treatment OSA . A clinically unstable medical condition define new diagnosis change medical management previous 2 month ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , CheyneStokes breathing , unstable angina , thyroid disease , depression psychosis , ventricular arrhythmia , cirrhosis , surgery , recently diagnose cancer ) Positive urine toxicology screen Rotating Night shift worker situation occupation regularly experience jet lag , irregular work schedule history last 6 month . Routine consumption 2 alcoholic beverage per day determine CAGE questionnaire ( 6365 ) . Unable perform test due inability communicate verbally , inability write read English ; le 5th grade read level ; visual , hear cognitive impairment ( e.g . previous head injury ) ; upper extremity motor deficit ( e.g. , previous stroke prevents patient use CPAP treatment ) . Current illicit drug use Excessive caffeine use ( More 10 caffeinated beverage per day ) Recent recur history recreational drug use lead tolerance dependance . Subjects know moderate severe renal disease undergo enhance dynamic portion study . Women positive pregnancy test exclude study . Subjects find mild sleep apnea ineligible participate study pay time . Active infection , malignancy chronic inflammatory disorder autoimmune disease since condition alter inflammatory biomarker level . No metal part body participant would allow enter magnet MRI</criteria>
