	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety study drug , lenalidomide , different dose level people diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) finish standard induction therapy partial complete response induction therapy . The investigator want find effect ( example , side effect ) study drug , lenalidomide , people leukemia . The investigator also want see additional treatment ( maintenance therapy ) lenalidomide keep leukemia relapse ( come back ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Consolidation Maintenance Adults &gt; /= 60 Years Age With AML Following Standard Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-arm , open-label phase Ib clinical trial test hypothesis daily use lenalidomide safe tolerable evidence rate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) see one month reinduction/consolidation older ( ≥ 60 year age ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient treat one cycle conventional , anthracycline-based induction . ( Re-induction prescribe lenalidomide therapy give patient partial remission/response post induction consolidation prescribe lenalidomide therapy post induction give patient complete remission ) . Dose escalation take place within cohort 28-day re-induction/ consolidation lenalidomide treatment University North Carolina Chapel Hill . After re-induction/consolidation , patient harbor ≥ 5 % peripheral blood bone marrow myeloblast remove protocol therapy . Patients &lt; 5 % peripheral blood bone marrow myeloblasts consolidation therapy allow continue maintenance therapy : lenalidomide 10 mg/day continuously 12 month . This trial initially restrict UNC enrollment . Once dose escalation re-induction/consolidation complete , planned dos test re-induction/consolidation , trial may open additional participating site . Up 26 patient enrol . This trial include Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) enrol patient baseline serially across trial . The investigator also plan study natural killer ( NK ) cell phenotype cytolytic function patient various interval across study ( baseline , post re-induction/consolidation , maintenance .</detailed_description>

Patients must treat 12 course intensive therapy first therapy AML , commonly describe induction . These therapy include cytarabine dose ≥700 mg/m2 combination anthracycline anthracenedione ( ≥ 135 mg/m2 daunorubicin , 36 mg/m2 idarubicin 40 mg/m2 mitoxantrone ) Patients must morphologic complete response ( CR ) , complete response incomplete hematologic recovery ( CRi ) partial response ( PR ) international work group criterion post induction therapy ( see Appendix A ) .
