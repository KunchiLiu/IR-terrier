	<brief_summary>Post thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) frequent burdensome complication proximal deep-vein thrombosis.Therapeutic option PTS limit mainly rely prevention . Therapeutic trial evidence elastic compression stocking ( ECS ) apply 30-40mmHg pressure ankle reduce rate PTS 50 % . Although ECS unlikely cause harm , clinical practice , compliance treatment appear low ECS may difficult apply wear . ECS light compression strength ( 20-30mmHg ) might easier apply comfortable . This could favor good compliance . CELEST randomize , multicentre , double-blind trial aim determine whether ECS apply 25mmHg targeted pressure ankle non inferior ECS apply 35mmHg targeted pressure ankle</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CELEST trial control , randomize , multicentre , non-inferiority double-blind trial aim determine whether ECS apply 25mmHg targeted pressure ankle non inferior ECS apply 35mmHg targeted pressure ankle . Patients first acute symptomatic proximal DVT randomize wear two year either ECS apply 25mmHg targeted pressure ankle ECS apply 35mmHg targeted pressure ankle . All patient prescribe anticoagulant least three month . The primary outcome rate PTS assess Villalta scale arm study 2 year study period . Rate compliance , severity PTS quality life group constitute main secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
