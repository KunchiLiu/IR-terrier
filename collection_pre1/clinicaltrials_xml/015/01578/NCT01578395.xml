	<brief_summary>Trial medicinal product Recent study reveal radiation-based procedure patient may lead DNA double-strand break human blood lymphocyte . Additionally , ex vivo study human blood lymphocyte show protective effect antioxidant agent describe decrease number DNA double-strand break . This study represent prospective , double-blinded , randomize , single center , placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial analyze capability antioxidant agent decrease number DNA double-strand break human blood lymphocytes patient undergo radiation-based cardiac examination ( 30 patient high-dose radiation exposure , 30 patient low-dose radiation exposure , 30 subject without radiation exposure ) . A protective effect antioxidant drug patient undergo radiation-based examination could therefore change patient management would provide important clinical impact .</brief_summary>
