	<brief_summary>The standard chemotherapy Hodgkin lymphoma call ABVD combination 4 chemotherapy drug ( doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ) . The number cycle ABVD chemotherapy Hodgkin lymphoma patient receive 4-6 cycle . In addition ABVD chemotherapy , patient Hodgkin lymphoma routinely receive radiation therapy . The use chemotherapy radiation may cause long term treatment related side effect heart problem cancer . Researchers try find combine ABVD chemotherapy new drug reduce number ABVD chemotherapy cycle give effective standard Hodgkin treatment . Brentuximab vedotin approve United States Food Drug administration ( FDA ) treatment Hodgkin lymphoma come back ( relapse ) . For research study , use brentuximab vedotin newly diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma consider investigational . Brentuximab vedotin antibody also chemotherapy drug attach . Antibodies proteins part immune system . They stick attack specific target cell . The antibody part brentuximab vedotin stick target call CD30 . CD30 important molecule cancer cell normal cell immune system . The purpose research study see effect treatment few cycle combination chemotherapy , ABVD , follow study drug brentuximab vedotin study participant Hodgkins lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemo w/ABVD Followed Brentuximab Vedotin Consolidation Newly Diagnosed , Non-Bulky Stage I/II Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design single arm pilot feasibility trial use induction 2-6 cycle ABVD ( doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ) chemotherapy follow 6 cycle brentuximab vedotin ( SGN-35 ) consolidation previously untreated patient stage I II non-bulky Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL ) . Feasibility determine percentage patient clinical evidence HL , achieve PET negative disease post brentuximab consolidation . We anticipate approximately 40 patient eligible across participate center ( include UNC , Mayo Clinic , UNC Cancer Network ( UNCCN ) ) 2 year period . A future phase II study evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) ABVD follow brentuximab vedotin consider feasible ≥ 13 15 patient enrol pilot trial become PET negative brentuximab vedotin consolidation .</detailed_description>
