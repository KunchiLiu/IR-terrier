	<brief_summary>Background : - Adjuvants substance include vaccine stimulate immune system increase body 's response vaccine . The MF59 adjuvant use seasonal flu vaccine Europe . However , fully test United States . Researchers want test immune response people receive bird flu vaccine without MF59 good understand adjuvant work . This information may help develop good flu vaccine . Objectives : - To compare healthy immune system responses bird flu vaccine without MF59 adjuvant . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants assign one two group . Each group initial vaccine , follow booster vaccine 21 day later . Both vaccination use type vaccine . One group vaccine MF59 ; group vaccine without . - All participant two 36-hour inpatient stay receive vaccine . Each stay involve vaccination , follow regular frequent blood draw . Participants monitor sign symptom may cause vaccine . - Additional blood sample collect 7 , 28 , 42 , 100 day initial vaccination ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Responses H5N1 Vaccine With Without MF59 Adjuvant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvants use many decade enhance effect vaccine host immune system , yet know little actually work . Better understand mechanism adjuvant activate immune system enable u develop well safer vaccine well broad range immune intervention wide spectrum disease include cancer autoimmunity . In current study propose study effect AS03 adjuvant innate/early immune response H5N1 , avian flu , potentially lethal disease subject assume na ( SqrRoot ) . AS03 aan adjuvant oil water emulsion contain DL-alpha-tocopherol , squalene non-ionic detergent Tween 80 widely use adjuvant flu vaccine produce GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) . We therefore propose randomize 60 healthy volunteer two intervention arm ( 25 volunteer arm 10 total replacement event volunteer return first vaccine ) . The first arm receive vaccine contain H5N1 AS03 adjuvant , second arm receive H5N1 without AS03 adjuvant . Both arm receive primary booster vaccination follow repeat blood sample evaluate immune response . We apply high throughput analytic technique use system biology method integrate collect data draw description immune system response without adjuvant . The primary objective compare multiplex immune response signature follow two ( primary boost ) vaccination GSK AS03 adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine , non-adjuvanted form H5N1 influenza vaccine , 3.75 mcg dose give 21 day apart identify difference early innate immune response . These immune signature also correlate clinical observation especially safety related local systemic event .</detailed_description>
