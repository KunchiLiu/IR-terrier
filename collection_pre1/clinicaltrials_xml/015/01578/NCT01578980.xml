	<brief_title>Outpatient Control-to-Range : System Monitoring Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Automated closed-loop control ( CLC ) blood glucose , know `` artificial pancreas '' ( AP ) tremendous impact health live people type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . This inter-institutional international research team forefront CLC development since begin Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) Artificial Pancreas initiative 2006 . Thus far , investigator conduct three closed-loop control clinical trial ( total 60 subject T1DM ) , demonstrate significantly time acceptable `` target '' blood glucose range CLC , significantly few hypoglycemic event CLC compare open loop . The overall objective sequentially test , validate , obtain regulatory approval , deploy home , closed-loop Control-to-Range ( CTR ) system comprise two algorithmic component : Safety Supervision Module ( SSM ) Hypoglycemia Mitigation Module ( HMM ) . The SSM monitor safety subject 's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump ( CSII ) prevent hypoglycemia also monitor integrity continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) data signal sensor deviation loss sensitivity . The HMM responsible optimal regulation postprandial hyperglycemic excursion correction bolus . This study test ability AP Platform ( 1 ) run CTR outpatient setting , ( 2 ) remotely monitor . Specifically , study involve study adult T1DM experience insulin pump user . Subjects spend two night ( ~42 hour ) local hotel , AP Platform remotely monitor adjacent hotel room validation remote system monitor successfully occur . During study , study subject responsible operate CTR system nursing technician available additional support . A study physician senior engineer call . Five subject enrol University Virginia University California , Santa Barbara .</detailed_description>
