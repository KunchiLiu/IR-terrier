	<brief_summary>Some vaccine may work good give together another substance know adjuvant give experimental procedure call electroporation ( EP ) . EP method electric pulse administer muscle vaccine injection give . The addition adjuvant vaccine delivery EP may increase person 's immune response vaccine . Combination approach DNA vaccine follow live vector boost may also increase person 's immune response vaccine component . All intervention test study . This study evaluate safety tolerability immune response HIV DNA vaccine without plasmid IL-12 adjuvant , give EP follow live vector vaccine give IM needle syringe healthy , HIV-uninfected adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response HIV-MAG DNA Vaccine With Without Plasmid IL-12 Adjuvant Delivered Intramuscularly Via Electroporation Followed VSV-gag HIV Vaccine Boost Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness vaccine may increase combine adjuvant and/or give EP . The addition adjuvant EP may increase person 's immune response vaccine . Furthermore , immune response HIV antigens may improve give DNA vaccine boost live vector vaccine . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity HIV DNA vaccine ( HIV-MAG ) alone combination IL-12 pDNA adjuvant , deliver IM via EP follow Vesicular Stomatitis Virus ( VSV ) HIV gag vaccine boost give IM needle syringe healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Participants enrol study one four group . Each four group receive 3 mg HIV-MAG vaccine alone combine one three different dos IL-12 pDNA adjuvant , follow VSV HIV gag vaccine boost . Within four group , participant randomly assign receive study vaccine placebo . At study entry ( Day 0 ) , participant undergo physical examination blood collection . Female participant also take pregnancy test . Participants complete questionnaire receive counsel HIV risk reduction . They also receive first vaccination . Participants remain clinic 30 minute vaccination observation monitoring . Additional vaccination study visit occur Months 1 , 3 , 6 . At Months 1 3 , participant receive vaccine placebo receive study entry ; Month 6 , participant receive VSV HIV gag vaccine placebo . For 3 day study entry Months 1 3 vaccination visit , participant record symptoms diary . After Month 6 vaccination visit , participant record symptoms 7 day . Participants Groups 1 3 attend additional study visit Days 1 , 3 , 14 , 42 , 91 , 98 , 169 , 171 , 175 , 182 , 273 , 364 . Participants Groups 2 4 attend additional study visit Days 14 , 42 , 98 , 182 , 273 , 364 . Most study visit include physical examination , blood collection , oral mucosa examination , interviews questionnaire , oral mucosa examination . If participant oral sore , oral swab may collect . Saliva also may collect . Select study visit include mini mental state exam , urine collection , HIV testing , risk reduction counsel . Study researcher contact participant Months 15 , 24 , 36 follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
