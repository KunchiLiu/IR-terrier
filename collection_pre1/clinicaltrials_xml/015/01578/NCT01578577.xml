	<detailed_description>Medication therapy management ( MTM ) describe set procedure include : medication review , assembly personal medication record , development action plan , intervention necessary , follow-up . However , evidence show effectiveness general MTM intervention scant . MTM often perform separately patient ' usual source care ( i.e. , pharmacy ) . This could limit effectiveness since medication-related concern would discuss clinician aware regimen intend patient ' prescribers . Cost another barrier widespread use MTM . Health information technology primary care could leverage assist MTM task . The investigator field test low literacy MTM tool embed within EHR 1 ) activate patient review medication , 2 ) automate provision plain language , medication information , 3 ) provide print tool help patient engage provider , consolidate regime . These tool develop patient , physician , pharmacist feedback . For study , investigator combine tool address range MTM task . In aggregate , study refers Electronic health record-based Health literacy Medication therapy management Intervention , 'EHMI ' . The investigator evaluate effect approach among patient uncontrolled hypertension treat federally qualified health center ( FQHCs ) . This may relatively low-cost strategy ideal safety net practice use EHRs whose patient may great risk limit literacy . It also possible EHMI strategy may result significant change . Therefore , investigator also evaluate use nurse educator help patient utilize EHMI tool , provide brief counseling , track progress . This three-arm , clinic-randomized , controlled trial conduct within network FQHCs evaluate EHMI EHMI + Nurse Educator intervention compare usual care . Recruited patient follow 12 month . The investigator test impact two strategy blood pressure level , anticipate power detect 4 mm Hg difference systolic blood pressure primary outcome . The investigator also assess impact diastolic blood pressure , well HbA1c LDL cholesterol control subgroup diabetes . The investigator determine intervention ' effect : 1 ) medication understanding , 2 ) discrepancy , 3 ) adherence . The investigator specifically examine intervention effect among group different literacy level . The investigator also assess fidelity cost intervention guide future dissemination effort .</detailed_description>
