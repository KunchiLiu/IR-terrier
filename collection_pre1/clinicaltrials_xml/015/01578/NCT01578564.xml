	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Males females ≥ 18 year age Subjects histologic diagnosis solid tumor cancer epithelial origin . Subjects advance refractory cancer standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . There limitation number type prior therapy . Subjects must recover major infection and/or surgical procedure , opinion investigator , significant active concurrent medical illness preclude protocol treatment . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance Score ≤ 1 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Subjects must adequate organ marrow function define : 1. hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ( ≥5.6 mmol/L ) 2. white blood cell ≥3,000/mm³ ( ≥3×10⁹/L ) 3. absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm³ ( ≥1.5×10⁹/L ) 4. platelet ≥100,000/μL ( ≥100×10⁹/L ) 5. total bilirubin ≤1.5× upper limit normal ( ULN ) 6 . AST/ALT/AP ≤2.5× ULN ( ALT/AST ≤5.0x ULN case document liver metastasis 7. creatinine ≤1.5× ULN 8. albumin ≥3.0 g/dL ( ≥30 g/L ) 9 . INR ≤1.4 Ability understand voluntarily sign informed consent document Chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic investigational therapy allow within either 30 day , 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior study drug administration . History clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor involvement ( metastasis ) know clinically relevant CNS pathology ( e.g. , epilepsy , seizure , paresis , aphasia , cerebellar disease , severe brain injury , psychosis ) . Concurrent malignancy solid tumor investigation , require active treatment . History clinically significant allergic reaction attribute injected compound . History follow cardiovascular event condition within past 6 month prior enrolment : myocardial infarction , unstable angina , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , New York Heart Association Class ≥ II chronic heart failure , hypokalemia , significant arrhythmia* ; QTc interval &gt; 430 msec use drug prolong QT interval screening ; family history long QT syndrome . ( * Significant arrhythmia define symptom syncope severe palpitation ( palpitation require referral cardiac monitoring ) , ECG find supraventricular tachycardia ( include ventricular fibrillation ) ventricular ectopy ( ventricular premature depolarization ) . Clinically significant uncontrolled major medical condition ( ) place subject unacceptably high risk toxicity . These include , limited : active infection , symptomatic pulmonary disease , inadequate pulmonary function , seizure disorder , psychiatric illness . Current use one antihypertensive medication . For patient receive antihypertensive medication : systolic blood pressure &lt; 120 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 70 mmHg screening . A known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C infection , determine medical history . Major surgical procedure within 4 week prior enrolment . Lactating pregnant female . Females childbearing potential male use adequate birth control . Current treatment treatment within 4 week screen bisphosphonates . Screening serum calcium level &lt; 2.20 mmol/L [ 8.8 mg/dL ] ( correction serum albumin History acute pancreatitis within 12 month prior screen Known hypoparathyroidism , pseudohypoparathyroidism , vitamin D deficiency , clinical evidence condition know associated hypocalcemia , include : , hypoalbuminemia , hyperphosphatemia , hypomagnesemia Current treatment treatment within 4 week screen drug know reduce serum calcium level , include : bisphosphonates , antiepileptic drug , cinacalcet , macrolide antibiotic ( erythromycin , azithromycin ) , large dos corticosteroid ( &gt; 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) , IV use corticosteroid . In addition , longterm use ( defined ongoing use ≥4 week ) corticosteroid within 8 week screen prohibit Any history venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) , include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) Current treatment treatment within 7 day screen vitamin K antagonist , warfarin . Patients require anticoagulation due central line may receive alternative agent , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) .</criteria>
