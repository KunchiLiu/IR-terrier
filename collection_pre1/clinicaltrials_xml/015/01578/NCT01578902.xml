	<detailed_description>Rationale Proposed Study With availability intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) Odette Cancer Centre ( OCC ) , opportunity explore use much intensive hypofractionation schedule prostate cancer . Using alpha/beta ratio 1.3 , dose 35 Gy 5 fraction would equivalent 88 Gy deliver 2 Gy fraction . For normal tissue ( alpha/beta value 2 ) , would equivalent 78 Gy 2 Gy fraction . As , linear quadratic equation predict 35 Gy 5 fraction result increase late toxicity normal tissue compare standard dose escalate radiotherapy . However , biological dose prostate cancer would significantly increase . As safety precaution study proposal , investigator propose deliver 35 Gy 5 fraction 5 week ( one radiotherapy fraction 7 Gy per week ) allow normal tissue repair . With IMRT , expect superior conformality high dose region around target volume . As well , use daily on-line imaging allow u eliminate interfraction prostate motion error use tight plan target volume margin residual intrafraction motion . At OCC , approach already show feasible currently employ phase 1/2 concomitant boost study high risk prostate cancer . If proven safe effective , hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule may significant practical advantage well . With 1 fraction radiotherapy deliver week ( total 5 week ) , huge saving resource utilization increase convenience patient . The investigator propose start small phase 1 study explore use dose fractionation men low risk prostate cancer . The primary endpoint small pilot study would acute late normal tissue toxicity . If prove feasible safe , external peer-reviewed funding seek explore novel treatment schedule large phase 2 setting .</detailed_description>
