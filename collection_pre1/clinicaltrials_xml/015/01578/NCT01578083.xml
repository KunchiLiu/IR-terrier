	<brief_summary>The investigator overall research hypothesis systemic chemotherapy induce structural change white matter brain demonstrate Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) functional change well-defined cortical neural network demonstrate resting-state functional connectivity MRI ( rs-fcMRI ) . The investigator believe structural functional change responsible cognitive symptom associate chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment ( CICI ) . The Specific Aim study : To assess impact chemotherapy structural white matter define DTI functional cognitive network define rs-fcMRI comparing sample breast cancer survivor self-reported CICI breast cancer survivor without CICI . Hypothesis : Post-chemotherapy breast cancer patient self-reported CICI abnormal structural connection characterize DTI-defined disruption fractional anisotropy ( FA ) mean diffusivity ( MD ) abnormal functional connectivity characterize rs-fcMRI-defined disruption cognitive network compare patient without self-reported CICI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy link cognitive impairment among breast cancer patient , especially domains executive function ( plan problem solve ) , attention , learn , information processing . The etiology chemotherapy-associated impairment remain unknown , although recent neuroimaging study suggest disruption white matter integrity may play role . With continued use chemotherapy breast cancer patient , study 's novel use functional neuroimaging significant well inform practitioner patient potential consequence anticipate serve start point development therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria ( Phase I II ) : Participants must females 35 70 year age . Participants must diagnose breast cancer complete chemotherapy , within precede 2 year . Participants must complete intended full course chemotherapy regimen least 30 day prior participation . Participants must diagnose invasive ductal lobular BrCa Stages I , II , III ( American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stag manual , 7th edition , 2010 ) . Inclusion Criteria ( Phase II ) Participants must able read , write , speak English fluently . Participants must able provide valid informed consent . Participants must life expectancy great 6 month time approach enrollment . Cases Those selfreport CICI 75th percentile score Cognitive Failures Questionnaire ( CFQ ) global rating cognition response `` Extremely Affected '' `` Strongly Affected '' Controls Those whose CFQ score low 25th percentile report daily life affect cognitive impairment . Controls select age ( within 5 year ) match Case . â€¢ Participants prior cancer diagnose sit evidence active disease within past year . Participants receive skullbase radiation treatment within past year reason . Skullbase radiation may contribute symptom CICI . Participants active diagnosis acute chronic brainrelated neurological condition alter normal brain anatomy function , include Parkinson 's disease , Multiple Sclerosis , Alzheimer 's Disease , cerebral infarct , , history brain tumor ( ) , epilepsy , dementia . Must history traumatic brain injury ( loss consciousness &gt; 15 min . ) Participants implanted metal object compatible MRI , electrodes , pacemaker , intracardiac line , medication pump . Participants weigh 350 pound ( weight limit MRI machine ) . Participants history claustrophobia preclude undergoing MRI . Participants inability lie flat MRI . Any medical condition PI determines would render study unsafe best interest patient .</criteria>
