	<brief_title>Dabigatran Adherence Pilot Intervention Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses Specific Aims : Atrial fibrillation common increase risk thromboembolic event . Current national guideline recommend long-term treatment warfarin , oral anti-coagulant , patient atrial fibrillation multiple thromboembolic risk factor . Adherence warfarin important narrow therapeutic window , require frequent lab monitoring ( i.e. , INR ) dose adjustment . The majority veterans warfarin manage anti-coagulation clinic staff pharmacist routinely contact patient remind get blood draw , re-enforce medication adherence , adjust warfarin dose base INR value . Sub-therapeutic anti-coagulation increase risk thromboembolic event commonly due poor medication adherence . Dabigatran newly approve oral factor X inhibitor medication efficacious warfarin lower risk stroke systemic embolism patient atrial fibrillation . Additional advantage dabigatran include few drug-drug interaction standard dosing , eliminate need dose titration lab monitoring . However , adherence important consideration dabigatran twice day medication require monthly refill due formulation , strong risk factor non-adherence . In addition , patient take dabigatran follow anti-coagulation clinic lab value monitor , therefore , long benefit adherence support provide clinic . Non-adherence chronic cardiovascular medication common non-adherence dabigatran may potentially limit effectiveness routine clinical use . Rivaroxaban newly approve , Factor Xa inhibitor , oral medication prescribe reduce risk stroke systemic embolism among patient atrial fibrillation . Rivaroxaban daily medication recommend take even meal reduce potential risk decrease efficacy therapy . In randomized , double-blind study compare warfarin Rivaroxaban , Rivaroxaban find non-inferior warfarin prevention stroke systemic embolism patient atrial fibrillation , risk major critically relevant non-major bleed similar two anticoagulant . In addition , patient take Rivaroxaban follow anti-coagulation clinic lab value monitor , therefore , long benefit adherence support provide clinic . Non-adherence chronic cardiovascular medication common non-adherence Rivaroxaban may potentially limit effectiveness routine clinical use . Apixaban FDA approve anticoagulant , Factor Xa inhibitor , oral medication prescribe reduce risk stroke blood clot among patient atrial fibrillation . Apixaban take twice daily . In double-blind , double-dummy , randomize , non-inferior superior control trial , apixaban find superior warfarin reduce stroke , systemic embolism , death . In addition , patient take apixaban follow anti-coagulation clinic lab value monitor , therefore , long benefit adherence support provide clinic . Non-adherence chronic cardiovascular medication common non-adherence apixaban may potentially limit effectiveness routine clinical use . It anticipate many patient switch dabigatran follow recent publication criterion dabigatran use VA National Pharmacy Benefits Management Program . This provide opportune time conduct propose study focus adherence dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban . We first perform qualitative interview patient ( n~30 ) pharmacist ( n~20 ) good understand barrier facilitator dabigatran adherence . Informed qualitative finding literature intervention improve cardiovascular medication adherence , develop pilot test multi-faceted intervention improve adherence among patient recently start dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban . The proposal innovative proactively address dabigatran adherence . This pilot provide preliminary data eventual implementation study ass effectiveness intervention improve adherence dabigatran patient outcome , well cost-effectiveness . Specific aim 1 . Conduct in-depth , key informant interview sample patient ( n=30 ) recently start dabigatran atrial fibrillation determine barrier facilitator dabigatran adherence . 2 . Conduct in-depth , key informant interview sample pharmacist ( n=20 ) anti-coagulation clinic order understand perspectives barrier facilitator patient ' maintain adherence dabigatran . 3 . Informed qualitative interview , develop pilot test multi-faceted intervention target patient pharmacist improve adherence dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban . II . Background Significance : Atrial fibrillation common , affect 2.2 million Americans likely increase age US population . The devastate sequelae atrial fibrillation stroke . National guideline recommend warfarin , oral anticoagulant patient atrial fibrillation multiple risk factor ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes , old age , stroke TIA , heart failure ) reduce stroke risk . Veterans prescribed warfarin usually manage closely anti-coagulation clinic . Pharmacists staff clinic , coordinate blood draw , titrate warfarin dose maintain therapeutic INR level , re-enforcing adherence therapy . Prior meta-analysis suggests patient warfarin manage clinic well anticoagulation control compare patient follow non-specialized clinic . Dabigatran newly approve oral direct thrombin inhibitor demonstrate efficacious warfarin patient atrial fibrillation . In RE-LY trial , dabigatran reduce stroke systemic embolism ( Relative risk 0.66 ; 95 % CI , 0.53 0.82 ; P &lt; 0.001 ) similar risk major bleeding ( 3.36 % vs. 3.11 % per year ; warfarin vs. dabigatran p=0.31 ) . There several potential advantage dabigatran warfarin , include : 1 ) standard dose without need dose adjustment ; 2 ) need lab monitoring ; 3 ) few drug-drug interaction . For reason , dabigatran may prefer patient require chronic anti-coagulation therapy atrial fibrillation . Non-adherence cardiovascular medication common limit effectiveness medication routine clinical practice . For chronic cardiovascular medication , adherence rate begin decline follow initial prescription , particularly medication need take daily , treat asymptomatic condition require frequent refill . A prior study find ~25 % patient prescribed statin primary prevention still adherent 2 year index prescription . The benefit dabigatran see clinical trial may significantly lessen adherence dabigatran similar chronic cardiovascular medication . This issue non-adherence particularly germane dabigatran twice day medication , require monthly refill due formulation medication use generally primary prevention medication asymptomatic condition . In ROCKET AF Study , Rivaroxaban find non-inferior warfarin prevention stoke systemic embolism patient atrial fibrillation . Rivaroxaban non-inferior warfarin significantly reduce risk stroke systemic embolism 21 % ( hazard ratio ( HR ) , 0.79 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.66 0.96 ; p le 0.001 ) . The risk major clinically relevant non-major bleeding similar anticoagulant drug . In ARISTOTLE trial , apixaban great reduction hemorrhagic stroke compare warfarin group ( HR 0.51 ; 95 % CI 0.35 0.75 ; p le 0.001 ) . For secondary outcome death cause , apixaban superior warfarin ( HR 0.89 ; 95 % CL 0.8 0.998 ; p=0.047 ) . Pharmacists help patient improve adherence cardiovascular medication intermediate outcome BP LDL control . For anticoagulation therapy , pharmacist help patient maintain good INR control via anti-coagulation clinic compare patient manage clinic . Specific component anti-coagulation clinic find particularly helpful improve adherence include computerize patient monitoring identifies delinquent patient ( i.e. , lab monitoring ) frequent contact patient . An intervention focus adherence involve pharmacist potential improve dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban use benefit demonstrate clinical trial dabigatran realize routine clinical practice .</detailed_description>
