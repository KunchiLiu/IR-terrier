	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate Octreotide LAR Patients With Inoperable , Progressive , Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter , stratify , open , randomize , comparator-controlled , parallel-group phase III study . In study , treatment 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate plus best supportive care ( 30 mg Octreotide LAR ) compare treatment high dose ( 60 mg ) Octreotide LAR patient inoperable , somatostatin receptor positive , histologically proven midgut carcinoid tumour ; patient progressive Octreotide LAR . In case patient either arm experience clinical symptom ( i.e . diarrhoea flush ) associate carcinoid tumour , Octreotide s.c. rescue injection allow . Objective tumour response arm assess every 12±1 week first treatment date accord RECIST Criteria . The baseline CT scan/MRI must older 4 week project randomization date . Patients evaluate safety tolerability accordance Visit Schedules 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate arm Octreotide LAR arm indicate Table 1 Table 2 , respectively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Presence metastasize locally advanced , inoperable ( curative intent ) enrollment time , histologically proven , midgut carcinoid tumour ( centrally confirm ) . 2 . Ki67 index ≤ 20 % ( centrally confirm ) . 3 . Patients Octreotide LAR fix dose 20 mg 30 mg 34 week interval least 12 week prior randomization study . 4 . Patients ≥18 year age . 5 . Patients must progressive disease base RECIST Criteria , Version 1.1 receive uninterrupted fix dose Octreotide LAR ( 2030 mg/34 week ) . Disease progression must centrally confirm . In order make assessment , two CT ( MRI ) scan require . The old scan must older 3 year date randomization . The recent scan must older 4 week date randomization . Both scan must obtain patient receive fix dose Octreotide LAR ( 2030 mg/34 week ) follow exception ; 1 ) acceptable old scan obtain within 12 week patient receive fix dose regimen Octreotide LAR ( 2030 mg/34 week ) ; AND 2 ) acceptable either scan obtained time patient receive fix dose Octreotide LAR switch equivalent dose short act Octreotide 6 week order obtain OctreoScan® , provide patient return Octreotide LAR fix dose OctreoScan® obtain . 6 . Confirmed presence somatostatin receptor target lesion ( target/nontarget/measurable lesion definition see §Appendix 2 , Section 1 2 , RECIST Criteria , Version 1.1 ) document CT/MRI scan , base positive OctreoScan® imaging within 24 week prior randomization study ( centrally confirm ) . The OctreoScan® one perform patient fix dose Octreotide LAR . If patient OctreoScan® perform Octreotide LAR treatmentnaïve , patient must repeat OctreoScan® perform 3 month Octreotide LAR treatment enter clinical study prove index lesion new lesion still meet criterion inclusion . It acceptable patient temporarily switch Octreotide s.c. ( six week ) order obtain OctreoScan® , provide return fix dose Octreotide LAR prior scan . 7 . The tumour uptake observe target lesion ( target/nontarget/measurable lesion definition see §Appendix 2 , Sections 1 2 , RECIST Criteria , Version 1.1 ) use OctreoScan® must ≥ normal liver uptake observe planar imaging ( centrally confirm ) ( §Appendices 5 6 ) . 8 .
