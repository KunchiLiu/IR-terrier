	<brief_summary>Rationale : The consumption dietary protein immediately exercise necessary maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate ( 24 , 37 ) . Recent work suggest type protein consume ( e.g. , animal vs. plant-derived protein ) post-exercise recovery affect amplitude acute increase muscle protein synthesis rate ( 25 , 31 ) . Specifically , consumption bovine milk proteins immediately single bout resistance exercise stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate great consumption isonitrogenous soy-protein beverage ( 31 , 37 ) . Importantly , consumption milk promote great hypertrophy soy resistance training ( 10 ) . Thus , generally assume acute muscle protein synthetic response predict long-term training outcome , hypertrophy . Currently , great amount work carry study effect consume milk protein muscle protein synthesis rate resistance exercise ( 5 , 7 , 26 , 32 ) . However , little known effect type high-quality animal protein , beef , stimulate post-exercise muscle protein synthesis rate . Further describe muscle protein synthetic response consumption type high-quality animal protein provide valuable information individual milk allergy , lactose intolerance , simply strong dislike dairy product .

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Resistance exercise protein ingestion act separately synergistically stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate . This synergy muscle contraction protein ingestion provide basis training-mediated hypertrophy . Many worker manipulate post-exercise feeding paradigm attempt define 'optimal ' protein source consume support muscle protein accretion . Original work perform use intravenous infusion mix amino acid bolus ingestion mixture crystalline amino acid ; however , consume free amino acid rarely occur normal dietary situation . Currently , great deal interest study capacity dairy proteins stimulate post exercise muscle protein synthesis rate promote training-mediated hypertrophy . Dairy proteins represent attractive protein source researcher study rapidly digested/absorbed contain high proportional essential amino acid , especially leucine . Both characteristic , speed digestion/absorption peak amplitude leucinemia , fundamental maximal stimulation muscle protein synthesis rate protein ingestion . However , little known effect type high-quality animal protein , beef , stimulate post-exercise muscle protein synthesis rate . Beef consider high-quality widely consume protein source . Importantly , 113-g serve beef contain 30 g protein ( ~10 g essential amino acid ; ~2 g leucine ) similar amino acid composition milk protein . Certainly , evidence suggest synergistic effect exercise feed muscle protein synthesis rate still apparent consumption beef . However , worker compare response group consume alternative high-quality isonitrogenous-matched animal-derived protein source . As result , speculate capacity beef stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate compare milk proteins post exercise recovery . In present study , wish determine impact single meal-like amount mince beef dairy milk digestion absorption kinetics post exercise muscle protein synthesis rate . This study first directly compare two commonly consume protein-rich food item muscle protein synthesis rate healthy young men . This information highly relevant develop nutritional intervention maintain accrue muscle mass . HYPOTHESES &amp; OBJECTIVES The following hypothesis investigate : Ingestion mince meat resistance exercise increase muscle protein synthesis rate great extent ingestion bovine milk . Primary Objective : To determine whether intake mince beef effective ingestion milk protein beverage stimulate post exercise muscle protein synthesis rate young men . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) To assess protein digestion absorption whole body protein balance healthy young men . 2 ) To evaluate postprandial aminoacidemia ingestion mince beef milk protein beverage healthy young men . STUDY DESIGN The present study employ crossover design . In total , 12 healthy young male subject include study . Subjects randomly assign consume mince beef milk trial one . During test day , subject perform leg extension exercise immediately afterwards consume 35 g protein either mince beef milk . Approximately , two week later subject return laboratory identical experimental procedure trial 1 , include exercise worked-match trial 1 consumption alternative protein source consume trial 1 . Screening Subjects participate one screen session leg volume , body weight composition ( DEXA ) assess . Subjects ask fill medical questionnaire inquire general health , medical history , use medication sport activity . Additionally , subject participate orientation session familiarization exercise equipment . Subjects arrive laboratory 8.30 AM car public transportation . Body weight height assess , well body fat composition ( percentage ) via Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan . In event unexpected medical finding screening , subject always notify . If subject want receive notification participate study . During familiarization session exercise equipment , proper lift technique demonstrate knee extension exercise . A guided-motion exercise machine use promote proper form subject 's personal safety . Prior determination subject 's one repetition maximum ( 1RM ) , perform 2 set leg extension exercise 10 repetition exercise machine light load . Thereafter , load increase successful lift failure . 5 min rest period allow attempt . A repetition valid subject use proper form able complete entire lift control manner without assistance . Experimental test day Each subject participate 2 experimental test day , separate 14 day , day last 8.5 h. During test day , subject perform single bout knee extension exercise ingest 135-gram minced beef patty contain 35 g protein isonitrogenous-matched milk protein beverage . The use L- [ ring-2H5 ] -phenylalanine , L- [ ring-2H2 ] -tyrosine , [ 1-13C ] -leucine infusion allow u assess digestion absorption kinetics ingest protein source fractional synthetic rate ( FSR ) muscle protein fast feed state vivo human setting . Protocol At 8.00 , follow overnight fast , subject arrive laboratory car public transportation . Subject rest supine position Teflon catheter insert antecubital vein intravenous stable isotope infusion . A second Teflon catheter insert heated dorsal hand vein contralateral arm place hot-box ( 60C ) arterialize blood sample . Following basal blood collection ( 8 mL ; t=-210 min ) , plasma phenylalanine , leucine , tyrosine pool prim single intravenous dose tracer . Subsequently , blood sample obtain ( t=-200 ) continuous tracer infusion commence . Arterialized blood sample ( 8 mL ) drawn t= -185 , -170 , -120 , -60 , -30 min muscle biopsy collect vastus lateralis muscle ( t=-30 min ) . This muscle biopsy allow u determine basal muscle protein synthetic rate . Following collection muscle biopsy , subject perform knee extension exercise guided-motion exercise machine 4 set load lift 10 - 12 repetition . Subjects allow rest 2 minute exercise set load adjust maintain desired 10-12 repetition . Immediately exercise bout subject return rest supine position arterialize blood sample drawn . Afterwards , muscle biopsy collect ( t= -5 min ) opposite leg muscle biopsy obtain t= -30 . Subjects receive mince beef meal contain 35 g protein equivalent protein dose provide dairy milk ( t= 0 ) . Arterialized blood sample ( 8 ml ) collect t= 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 min postprandial ( feed ) period . The third muscle biopsy take leg last biopsy incision . Subsequently , arterialize blood sample ( 8 ml ) collect t=150 , 180 , 210 , 240 , 270 , 300 min . Finally , 300 min fourth muscle biopsy take incision last biopsy ( t= -0.5 120 min ) . In total , four muscle biopsy take two separate incision trial . The second third muscle biopsy ( immediately 2 h exercise ) allow u measure temporal muscle protein synthetic response different consume protein source ( milk vs. meat ) exercise . It generally assume 'peak ' stimulation muscle protein synthesis rate meaningful predict phenotypic outcome ( muscle hypertrophy ) . However , peak muscle protein synthesis rate may appear different time point depend protein source consume . Obtaining muscle biopsy 2 h post-exercise allow u determine peak muscle protein synthesis rate different consume protein source . However , resistance exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis rate extend beyond 2 h time point thus obtain fourth muscle biopsy 5 h also allow u obtain physiological relevant information regard anabolic response resistance exercise .</detailed_description>
