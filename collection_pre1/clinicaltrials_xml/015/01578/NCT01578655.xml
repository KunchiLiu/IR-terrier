	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study design confirm add custirsen cabazitaxel/prednisone treatment slow tumor progression enhance survival outcome compare standard cabazitaxel/prednisone treatment men metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . This randomized , open-label , multicenter , international trial . Treatment consist cabazitaxel/prednisone/custirsen vs. cabazitaxel/prednisone . A total approximately 630 patient randomize equal probability two arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Cabazitaxel/Prednisone Alone Combination With Custirsen 2nd Line Chemotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently , option second-line chemotherapy CRPC include docetaxel retreatment , mitoxantrone , chemotherapy , without proven clinical benefit . In 2010 , Phase 3 second-line chemotherapy trial ( TROPIC ) show survival advantage cabazitaxel , semi-synthetic taxane select overcome emergence taxane resistance , compare mitoxantrone . Clusterin stress-activated cytoprotective chaperone up-regulated variety anti-cancer therapy confers treatment resistance over-expressed . Inhibition clusterin expression use custirsen show enhance tumor cell death follow treatment chemotherapy . The clinical activity custirsen combination taxane docetaxel show two Phase 2 study . Given result observe use taxane either first-line second-line chemotherapy CRPC , combination custirsen may decrease taxane resistance enhance survival benefit taxane therapy . Thus , combination custirsen cabazitaxel may enhance survival second-line taxane chemotherapy CRPC .</detailed_description>
