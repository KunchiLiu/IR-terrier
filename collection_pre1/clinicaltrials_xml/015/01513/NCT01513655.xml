	<brief_title>Home Non Invasive Ventilation ( NIV ) Treatment COPD-patients After NIV-treated Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) show improve survival patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , admit acute hypercapnic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) ; NIV recommend treatment AHRF due COPD . COPD patient survive AHRF poor prognosis ; Chu et al . show one-year risk readmission 79.9 % ; new life-threatening event ( death repeat AHRF ) 63.3 % ; death 49.1 % . Hypothetically , long-term NIV ( LTNIV ) improve prognosis severe COPD . The majority trial focus patient chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due stable COPD ( i.e. , patient exacerbation prior LTNIV initiation ) ; result conflict . However , 2014 , Köhnlein et al . publish result large randomize control trial ( RCT ) LTNIV stable patient arterial CO2 tension ( Pa , CO2 ) 7 kPa high : The patient treat LTNIV one-year mortality 12 % vs. 33 % control ; patient treat LTNIV score high health-related quality-of-life ( HRQoL ) . Three RCTs study effect LTNIV unstable COPD , i.e. , participant enrol admission NIV treatment AHRF : Cheung et al . find patient treat LTNIV low rate repeat AHRF ( 38.5 % /year vs. 60.2 % /year , p = 0.039 ) ; Funk et al . find LTNIV group longer mean time clinical worsening ( 391 day vs. 162 day ; p = 0.0018 ) . However , large RCT Struik et al. , show difference LTNIV group control . Little known predicts AHRF severe COPD . However , base large ECLIPSE study exacerbation COPD , Hurst et al . Müllerova et al . show previous exacerbation predict new exacerbation ; previous admission due exacerbation COPD predict new admission death . We assume previous admission AHRF due COPD could predict new admission AHRF need NIV , well death . We retrospectively analyze 20 patient treat LTNIV follow pulmonary ward . The patient offer LTNIV admit NIV treatment AHRF least twice . We find patient ' number AHRF episodes admission due COPD decrease significantly . And four patient ( 20 % ) —considerably less 49.1 % show Chu et al.—died within one year initiation . Furthermore , highly select patient tolerate LTNIV well . Aim The aim RCT investigate whether LTNIV reduce mortality repeat AHRF patient admit NIV treatment AHRF due COPD ; , secondarily , whether LTNIV reduce mortality per se number repeat AHRF , readmission , exacerbation , improve quality life . Methods/Design Design The study multi-center randomize , control , open-label study . The participant include admission NIV treatment AHRF due COPD . If patient give consent ( see ) , randomize either LTNIV usual care . The acute NIV therapy continue long patient present hypercapnic acidosis severe dyspnea without NIV ; hereafter , NIV cease patient control group , whereas continue setting LTNIV patient . When stable deem appropriate physician , patient discharge . The included patient give possibility contact acute hotline , operate nurse . One week discharge , patient visit nurse . The patient follow outpatient department visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month discharge . A participant readmitted re-randomized . If participant intervention group , LTNIV resume , pause . Consent When stabilize able small pause NIV , patient present study . If interested , patient formally inform study one attending physician . This typically 2 day admission , although individual . The information session hold physician devoted time disturb . When inform , consent form sign patient informing physician . If participant want time consideration , new session plan one two day later . Intervention For intervention group , acute NIV treatment continue LTNIV pressure setting reverse respiratory failure hypercapnic acidosis . The participant offer initiate average volume-assured pressure support , mandatory . Before discharge , participant caregiver train handle cleaning ventilator , tube , mask , etc . The participant tell use ventilator minimum six hour daily , preferably sleep . At home visit outpatient consultation , LTNIV optimize accord participant 's request complaint . One month discharge , LTNIV participants one episode AHRF feel subjective improvement offer pause LTNIV therapy , provide follow discharge : exacerbation ; need antibiotic , increase oral corticosteroid , inhaled medicine ; hospitalization visit emergency room emergency physician due COPD ; fever 38˚C high least one day ; increase purulent expectoration ; increase dyspnea least one day . If agree pause LTNIV , participant instruct resume LTNIV one symptom . Randomization A total 150 COPD patient include four ward . The participant randomize LTNIV usual care 1:1 ratio , use computer-generated block-randomization center . The participant present seal envelope contain piece paper either `` A '' ( = LTNIV ) `` B '' ( = usual care ) . The randomization list store Gentofte Hospital seal envelope . 50 seal envelope prepare center . Sample size / power calculation Chu et al . show one-year risk death COPD patient survive admission NIV treatment AHRF 49.1 % ; We expect able reduce mortality 25 % . We use risks power calculation . We accept 0.05 risk type 1 error ( α ) 0.2 type 2 error ( β ) . With power 0.8 , need sample size 122 . With expect dropout 15 % , intend include 150 participant , 75 arm . Measurements Upon admission , measure : arterial blood gas Pa , CO2 , Pa , O2 , pH StHCO3- , firstly diagnose AHRF secondly , order titrate NIV treatment ; regular , venous blood sample , analyze infectious parameter , red white blood count , kidney- liver parameter ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; chest x-ray . These measurement do standard acute admission part protocol . At discharge , measure : lung function , i.e. , FEV1 , FVC FIVC ; peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 % ) ; arterial blood gas Pa , CO2 , Pa , O2 , pH StHCO3- ; height weight ; MRC Dyspnea score ; CAT , SRI ESS questionnaires ; note status medication long-term oxygen treatment ( LTOT ) , relevant . For intervention group , read ventilator 's SIM card regard compliance , daily use , apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) . At home visit one week discharge , measure : lung function SpO2 % . For intervention group , ensure ventilator , mask hose well-functioning ; patient well informed us ventilator correctly . At outpatient visit , measure : lung function ; SpO2 % ; arterial blood gas ; weight ; exhale concentration carbon mono-oxide ; MRCD ; CAT , SRI ESS questionnaires ; note status medication , smoking , LTOT , relevant . For intervention group , read ventilator 's SIM card regard compliance , daily use , AHI . At outpatient visit end patient 's study period , collect data mortality , hospital admission , exacerbation treat general practitioner emergency physician , emergency room visit . Collecting data All participant individual case report file ( CRF ) data note . The CRF contain nine section ; front page basic information participant , i.e. , patient number , date consent , allocation , ventilator setting ( relevant ) etc . ; section event study , i.e. , admission , discharge , home visit , five outpatient visit include completion data fifth . The CRF contain personally identifiable information . The file store locked room investigator access . Data Processing The primary outcome difference one-year-mortality LTNIV group control group , analyze Intention-To-Treat analysis . The mortality calculate Chi^2 , survival time calculate Cox proportional hazard regression , use Kaplan-Meier log rank . The difference study 's two group compute use Chi^2-statistics dichotomous variable t-tests continuous variable , assume data follow normal distribution . Differences time give event calculate Cox proportional hazard regression , use Kaplan-Meier survival statistic log rank . For comparison , p &lt; 0.05 level significance . For sample size calculation , use SAS ( Statistical Analysis System , version 9.4 ) . We use late version SAS statistical analysis . Publications Both positive negative result publish national international journal conference , symposium , etc . Ethics The study approve Research Ethics Committee , Data Protection Agency , Danish Health Authority . The trial register clinicaltrials.org , registration number NCT01513655 . Biological material The biological sample take general blood biochemistry arterial blood gas . This standard admission outpatient visit . The sample handle Dept . Clinical Biochemistry accord current guideline ; analysis , sample destroy . No biological material store . Arterial blood gas sample measure approximately 1mL ; venous blood sample measure approximately 10-15 mL .</detailed_description>
