	<brief_summary>Tat key HIV regulatory protein produce early infection , prior virus integration , necessary viral gene expression , cell-to-cell virus transmission disease progression . Previous study natural HIV infection , indicate presence Tat-specific immune response correlate low incidence reduce risk progression AIDS compare anti-Tat negative individual suggest immune response Tat may exert protective role control progression AIDS vivo . Moreover , Tat conserve immunogenic region ( B T cell ) among subtypes . subtypes . Recent data , fact , indicate effective cross-clade recognition clade B strain-derived ( BH-10 ) Tat protein HTLV-IIIB lab-adapted virus strain ( Buttò , 2003 ) , isolate 30 year ago ( Ratner , 1985 ) , sera individual infect virus circulate present Italy Africa , thus reflect high degree conservation correspond Tat region provide strong formal evidence Tat-based vaccine may indeed use different geographic area world , since capable induce broad immune response different virus clade . Based rationale positive result preclinical ( Cafaro , Nat Med 1999 ) phase I preventive therapeutic clinical trial Tat protein ( ISS P-001 ISS T-001 , respectively ) ( Ensoli AIDS 2008 , Vaccine 2009 ; Longo Vaccine 2009 ; Bellino RRCT , 2009 ) phase II therapeutic , open label , clinical study Tat protein ( ISS T-002 , ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00751595 ) sponsor ISS activate 11 clinical site Italy HIV-infected HAART-treated subject ( Ensoli F , Retrovirology 2015 ) .In study , subject randomize two arm receive 3 5 vaccination monthly ; arm compose two treatment group , receive 7 , 5 30 µg Tat , respectively.Results obtain 168 individual trial completion ( 48 week ) , well follow-up 144 week subgroup vaccine , indicate Tat vaccination safe , immunogenic capable reduce immune dysregulation persist despite HAART treat individual ( Ensoli et al , PLoS ONE 2010 ) . Anti-Tat Abs induce patient ( 79 % ) , high frequency durability Tat 30 µg group ( 89 % ) particularly give 3 time ( 92 % ) ( Ensoli B. , PLoS ONE 2010 ; Ensoli F. , Retrovirology 2015 ) . Moreover , vaccination promote durable significant restoration T , B , natural killer ( NK ) cell , CD4+ CD8+ central memory subset . Moreover , significant reduction blood proviral DNA see week 72 , particularly PI-based regimen Tat 30 µg give 3 time ( 30 μg , 3x ) , reach predict 70 % decay 3 year vaccination half-life 88 week . This decay significantly associate anti-Tat IgM IgG Abs neutralization Tat-mediated entry oligomeric Env dendritic cell , predict HIV-1 DNA decay . Finally , 30 μg , 3x group one showing significant increase NK cell CD38+HLA-DR+/CD8+ T cell , phenotype associate increase kill activity elite controller ( Ensoli F. , Retrovirology 2015 ) . These data indicate Tat immunization represent promise pathogenesis-driven intervention intensify HAART efficacy ( Ensoli et al , PLoS ONE 2010 ) .</brief_summary>
