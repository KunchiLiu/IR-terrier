	<criteria>Participant diagnosis CDI define : ) presence diarrhea ( passage 3 loose stool 24 few hour ) ; b ) positive test toxigenic C. difficile stool collect 7 day study infusion . Participant receive SOC therapy ( i.e. , oral metronidazole , oral vancomycin , IV metronidazole concurrent oral vancomycin , oral fidaxomicin , oral fidaxomicin concurrent IV metronidazole ) CDI . Participant highly unlikely become pregnant impregnate partner meeting least one follow criterion : ) females reproductive potential ( i.e. , one either ( 1 ) reach natural menopause , define 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] level postmenopausal range , 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea include case underlie disease , anorexia nervosa , cause amenorrhea ; ( 2 ) 6 week post surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ; ( 3 ) bilateral tubal ligation ) ; b ) participant reproductive potential agree remain abstinent use ( partner use ) two acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , diaphragm spermicide ; contraceptive sponge , condom , vasectomy register marketed hormonal contraceptive contain estrogen and/or progestational agent include oral , subcutaneous , intrauterine , intramuscular agent ) start enrollment throughout 12week study . Participant uncontrolled chronic diarrheal illness normal 24hour bowel movement habit 3 loose stool . Participant plan surgery CDI within 24 hour . Female participant positive pregnancy test 48 hour infusion premenopausal female sterilize therefore potential bear child unwilling undergo pregnancy test . Female participant breast feed plan breast feed completion 12week study . Female participant planning donate ova completion 12week study male participant plan impregnate donate sperm completion 12week study . Participant previously participate study , previously receive MK3415 MK6072 ( either alone combination ) , receive C. difficile vaccine , receive another experimental monoclonal antibody C. difficile toxin A B . Participant plan donate blood and/or blood product within 6 month infusion . Participant receive immune globulin within 6 month infusion plan receive immune globulin completion 12week study . Treatment SOC therapy plan long 14 day . Participant receive 24hour regimen cholestyramine , colestimide , rifaximin , nitazoxanide within 14 day infusion plan receive medication completion 12week study period . Participant plan take medication give decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis , loperamide ( Imodium™ ) diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate ( Lomotil™ ) time 14 day infusion . Participants receive opioid medication onset diarrhea may include stable dose anticipation dose decrease cessation use . Participant plan take probiotic Saccaromyces boulardii plan receive fecal transplantation therapy , therapy demonstrate decrease CDI recurrence time infusion ( Day 1 ) completion 12week study period . Participant receive another investigational study agent within past 30 day currently participate schedule participate clinical study investigational agent 12week study . Participant expect survive 72 hour . Participant condition , opinion investigator , would jeopardize safety right participant , would make unlikely participant complete study , would confound result study .</criteria>
