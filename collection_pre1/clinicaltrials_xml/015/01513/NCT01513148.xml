	<brief_summary>The introduction light emit diode ( LED ) device novel treatment pain relief place low-level laser warrant fundamental research effect LED device one potential explanatory mechanism : peripheral neurophysiology vivo . A randomize control study conduct measure nerve conduction superficial radial nerve healthy subject ( n=64 ) . One baseline measurement five post-irradiation recording ( 2-min interval ) perform nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) peak latency ( PL ) peak amplitude ( PA ) . The experimental group ( =32 ) receive irradiation 2 J/cm2 infrared LED device ( Dynatronics Solaris Model 705 ) , placebo group treat sham irradiation . The purpose study investigate effect LED light conduction velocity amplitude superficial radial nerve .</brief_summary>
