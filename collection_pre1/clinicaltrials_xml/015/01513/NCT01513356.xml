	<detailed_description>BKM120 potent highly specific oral pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor , currently investigation first-in-man study patient advance solid tumor ( wild type PIK3CA-mutated ) . Consistent , dose-dependent pharmacodynamic activity demonstrate clear sign anti-tumor activity see BKM120 . Three breast cancer patient show significant tumor shrinkage ≥ 2 month . Two confirm partial response ( PRs ) per RECIST see , one patient triple negative KRAS-mutated breast cancer patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive , PIK3CAmutated tumor . Two minor response also observe ; one occur HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
