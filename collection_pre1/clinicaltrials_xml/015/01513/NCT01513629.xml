	<brief_summary>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) highly hereditary neuropsychiatric disorder . In child adolescent worldwide , prevalence ASD estimate 0.6 % . Understanding biological mechanism disorder could potentially facilitate prompt , accurate personalize therapy . The dysfunction fronto-temporal circuitry may explain language impairment ASD . In addition , piece evidence suggest abnormality cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry might relate social deficit . However , little know change two circuitry relate variation genotype . Previous report ASD use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) demonstrate alteration brain structure . Recent advance neuroimaging show structural connectivity specific circuitry superior regional analysis term high penetrance genetic effect well account behavioral variance . Therefore , plausible connectivity imaging may serve effective endophenotypes link clinical manifestation ( phenotype ) biological variable ( genotype ) . In past five year , lab establish world lead diffusion spectrum image technique , apply technique clinical study ASD , schizophrenia , stroke epilepsy . The clinical experience technical strength provide strong basis u extend image genetics , aim determine effective endophenotypes ASD . Therefore , goal project validate structural connectivity fronto-temporal cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry effective image endophenotypes ASD . Specifically , investigator achieve goal series validation . First , investigator demonstrate structural connectivity two targeted circuitry indeed different among group patient ASD , unaffected sibling , neurotypicals . Second , investigator demonstrate neurotypicals unaffected sibling alter structural connectivity relate social language impairment indeed different carrier risk gene , i.e . CNTNAP2 SLC25A12 , respectively . Last , investigator demonstrate participant alter structural connectivity associate correspond behavioral variance social language function . This two-year project cohort study consist three group , namely patient , unaffected sibling , control group match age , gender handedness . The patient sibling group consist 20 boy , age 10-15 year old , control group consist 40 boy . The examination include behavior assessment ( IQ test , neuropsychological clinical assessment ) , MRI study ( structure MRI diffusion spectrum image structural connectivity ) genome scan ( specifically candidate gene relate language function , i.e . SLC25A12 , social function , i.e . CNTNAP2 ) . In conclusion , first cohort project image genetics Taiwan . The success project facilitate progress translational neuroscience Taiwan . The methodology validate endophenotype readily extend psychiatric disease .</brief_summary>
