	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy combine treatment strategy WT1ASCI , infusion ex vivo regulatory T cell deplete T lymphocytes vivo regulatory T cell depletion post-consolidation therapy patient WT1-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia . The study also evaluate clinical activity immune response approach bad risk patient CR1 patient CR2 CR3 , non eligible allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-risk intermediate-high risk CR1 AML patient eligible allo-SCT chemotherapy unfavorable prognosis , currently treatment able improve survival . New approach treat patient thus urgently need . Active immunization tumor antigens certainly one approach . The tumor antigen target study WT1 , overexpressed act oncogene leukemia several type solid tumor . WT1-positive acute myeloid Leukemia patient complete remission ( CR ) first undergo two cytaphereses , one frozen , CD25+ T cell depletion , second , frozen unmanipulated Treg back-up . Next , patient treat 5 week oral cyclophosphamide accord so-called `` metronomic regimen '' achieve vivo Treg depletion . Patients thereafter receive WT1 ASCI combine CD25+ T cell deplete lymphocyte . The total duration treatment period last 48 month ( 4 year ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient cytologically proven AML , define WHO classification . The leukemia de novo secondary leukemia . 2 . The patient complete morphologic remission Note : Cytogenetic CR ( CRc ) molecular CR ( CRm ) require . AML patient first complete remission ( CR1 ) eligible alloHSCT follow institution 's standard care ( except favourable genetic group subset exclude study ) . All AML patient second third complete morphological remission ( CR2 CR3 ) eligible alloHSCT . 3 . The patient receive follow therapy accord institution 's standard care : For patient ≤ 60 year old , least two cycle intensive chemotherapy ( induction consolidation ) For patient &gt; 60 year old , least one induction chemotherapy . Any patient severe comorbidity consolidation unacceptable , receive one induction therapy . 4 . The patient 's blast cell show overexpression WT1 transcript , detect peripheral blood qRTPCR diagnosis first relapse . 5 . Written inform consent obtain prior performance protocolspecific procedure . 6 . The patient ≥ 18 year age time sign ICF . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 time enrollment . 8 . Adequate hepatic renal function define : Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . Serum alanine aminotransferase ALAT &lt; 2.5 time ULN . Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min . 9 . If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e. , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopausal , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception 30 day prior treatment administration , negative pregnancy test , continue precaution two month completion treatment administration series . 10 . Under investigator criterion , patient able comply protocol requirement duration study . 11 . In investigator 's opinion compliance Institution hematology guidance , patient eligible approve standard care induction chemotherapy alloHSCT . 1 . The patient morphologic leukemiafree state morphologic complete remission incomplete blood count recovery define IWG Response Criteria 2 . The patient CR1 category lowrisk relapse patient , i.e . belong favourable genetic group subset . 3 . The patient diagnose leukemic central nervous system ( CNS ) disease ( E.g . chemotherapy ) present neurological symptom baseline suggestive CNS involvement . 4 . The patient receive , receive ( due receive ) alloHSCT . 5 . The patient ( ) concomitant malignancy , except effectively treat malignancy consider investigator highly likely cure . 6 . The patient know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive . 7 . The patient symptomatic autoimmune disease , limited , multiple sclerosis , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease . 8 . The patient history allergic reaction likely exacerbate component study investigational product . 9 . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . 10 . The patient congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction . 11 . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent , comply study procedure . 12 . The patient receive investigational nonregistered medicinal product study medication within 30 day precede first dose study medication , plan receive drug study period . 13 . The patient require concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . The use prednisone , equivalent , &lt; 0.5 mg/kg/day ( absolute maximum 40 mg/day ) , inhaled corticosteroid topical steroid permit . 14 . The patient active infection and/or receive antibiotic . The patient receive i.v . administration antibiotic within two week prior first study treatment oral antibiotic within one week prior first study treatment . 15 . For female patient : patient pregnant lactating .</criteria>
