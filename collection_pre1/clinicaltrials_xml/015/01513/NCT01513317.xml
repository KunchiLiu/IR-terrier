	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Siltuximab Plus Best Supportive Care Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care Anemic Patients With International Prognostic Scoring System Low- Intermediate-1-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study treatment administer double-blind 12 week , mean patient study personnel know identity treatment . Approximately 75 patient randomize ( patient assign treatment chance ) 2:1 ratio receive siltuximab plus best supportive care ( BSC ) ( Group A ) placebo plus BSC ( Group B ) . BSC include RBC transfusion , antimicrobial , white blood cell ( WBC ) growth factor , platelet transfusion . Patients complete 12 week treatment may qualify receive siltuximab open-label ( identity treatment know ) treatment . Treatment may continue death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , clinical cutoff ( defined 24 week last patient randomize ) , whichever occur first . The study end approximately 36 week last patient randomize . Patient safety monitor . Siltuximab match placebo supply sterile , lyophilized formulation reconstitution intravenous ( IV ) infusion . Group A : siltuximab ( 15 mg/kg ) administer 1-hour infusion every 4 week + BSC , Group B : placebo administer 1-hour infusion every 4 week + BSC .</detailed_description>
