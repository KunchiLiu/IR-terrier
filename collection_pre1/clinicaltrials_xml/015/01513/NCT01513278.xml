	<brief_summary>The standard treatment early-stage breast cancer breast-conserving surgery follow adjuvant radiation therapy whole breast . This approach lead low recurrence rate good cosmesis provide effective alternative mastectomy . However , woman receive radiotherapy radiation dermatitis occur degree . Radiation dermatitis generally manifest within week start radiation therapy . Its onset varies depend radiation dose intensity normal tissue sensitivity individual . As cumulative dose radiation increase transient erythema occur first week radiotherapy may evolve persistent erythema dry even moist desquamation reflect damage basal cell layer sweat sebaceous gland . There currently evidence prophylactic treatment , beyond keep irradiated area clean dry , effective reduce incidence severity radiation dermatitis ( Bolderston et al . 2006 ) . However , together enzymes peroxidase pathway , SOD scavenge superoxide , hydroxyl , oxygenate free radical ( Klug et al . 1972 ; Tainer al . 1983 ) . In physiological condition , production free radical ( Monte &amp; Sacerdote 1994 ) action antiradicals ' enzyme balance . Following tissue injury , either pathological cause agent radiation therapy , excess production free radical observe ( Petkau 1986 ; Lorette &amp; Machet 2001 ) . Furthermore , basal SOD increase breast cancer patient radiation therapy compare control ( Seth et al . 2003 ) , decrease radiotherapy ( Ray al . 2000 ) . Hence , liposomal rhSOD apply radiotherapy could use prevent effect free radical thus might protect patient 's skin radiation-induced skin reaction . TREATMENT PLAN All patient receive APN201 placebo time . The irradiated region divide vertically two symmetric area ( leave right ) . One area treat APN201 , area treat placebo double-blind fashion . Study treatment ( APN201 placebo ) start day initiation radiation therapy continue end radiation therapy whole breast ( 25 28 daily fraction total dose 50.0 Gy 50.4 Gy , respectively ) ( see schedule assessment , section 5.1 ) . Study treatment stop radiation dermatitis ≥ grade 2 occurs one treat area ≥ 3 day AND difference severity radiation dermatitis ≥ 1 grade see two treated area . From point time patient receives treatment appear beneficial treatment apply whole irradiated region completion 25th , respectively 28th , fraction . Treatment stop early case progressive disease unacceptable toxicity intolerability .</brief_summary>
