	<brief_summary>Focal myometrial ( uterine ) contraction occur substantial number vaginal ultrasound examination impede accurate cervical length measurement placental location determination . The timing bladder void associate prevalence focal myometrial contraction vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment . We propose blind randomized-controlled trial bladder void immediately vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment compare bladder void immediately vaginal ultrasound order determine prevalence focal myometrial contraction vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment test whether time bladder void associate incidence .</brief_summary>
