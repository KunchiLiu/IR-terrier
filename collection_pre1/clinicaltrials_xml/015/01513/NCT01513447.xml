	<brief_summary>For woman , significant pain experience pain associate childbirth . Up one-third woman experience `` back labor '' , typically occur fetus assumes vary degree malposition , especially occiput posterior position , cause additional constant pressure maternal spine pelvis . `` Back labor '' present constant pain , occur even contraction . It often difficult manage , patient , obstetrician , anesthesiologist , may increase rate instrumental caesarian delivery . Epidural anesthesia/analgesia common effective intervention use help woman cope labor pain . Dilute concentration local anesthetic opioid provide complete analgesia woman . Some woman , however , breakthrough pain , often due `` back labor , '' require concentrate drug solution . This increase side effect associate drug ( e.g. , hypotension , pruritus , motor block ) , thus treatment pain pose challenge anesthesiologist obstetrician . Sterile water injection ( SWI ) simple well-established method manage labor pain among midwife . This intervention first use alleviate pain associate kidney stone , introduce obstetrics 1970s . Using syringe , small amount sterile water deposit subcutaneously near sacral area . The sterile water cause osmotic mechanical irritation result brief ( 15-30 second ) significant stinging sensation . The onset pain relief follow almost immediately may last two hour . The procedure repeat number time . Sterile water pain management often administer use four intracutaneous injection : two site lateral lumbosacral spine two sit 2-3 cm 1-2 cm medial original two injection site . 0.1 mL sterile water inject dermal layer raise small bleb skin surface four site . In labor , injection administer sequentially uterine contraction , series four injection , perform two time , complete within 20-30 second . The investigator hypothesize use sterile water injection woman neuraxial analgesia breakthrough pain result decrease local anesthetic requirement increase patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since assume neuraxial anesthetic place prior transition active phase labor , patient receive intervention report breakthrough pain . Prior administration intervention , adequacy exist neuraxial anesthetic verified bilateral decrease discrimination cold T8 sacrum . Four tuberculin syrinx , contain 0.1 mL assign solution label `` study drug '' prepare . Patients allocate study group receive sterile water , allocate control group receive sterile normal saline solution . The area inject prepared chlorhexidine wipe ensure sterility . In sit position , study subject receive total 0.4 mL `` study drug '' via four injection : bilateral injection posterior superior iliac spine bilateral injection 1 cm medial 1-2 cm inferior first point . Patients ask rate overall labor pain use 0-100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain prior study drug administration every 30 minute commencement push . They also ask specifically rate low back pain VAS . Analgesia administration data time study drug injection , include maintenance epidural solution volume , time first patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) bolus request , number PCEA bolus request deliver dos , total PCEA bupivacaine dose , time first request manual rebolus , number manual bolus dos , manual bolus bupivacaine dose , total bupivacaine dose total fentanyl dose . Additional record data include maternal age , height , weight , cervical dilation initiation neuraxial analgesia study drug administration , duration labor ( initiation analgesia delivery ) , maximum oxytocin infusion rate labor , mode delivery . A `` total labor pain score '' assess approximately 60 minute delivery , well satisfaction labor analgesia use 100-mm VAS .</detailed_description>
