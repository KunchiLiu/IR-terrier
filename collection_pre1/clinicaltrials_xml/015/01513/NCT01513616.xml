	<brief_summary>Dyspnea ( respiratory discomfort ) activity limitation common symptom chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) contribute importantly perceive poor quality life . Recent international guideline stress importance dyspnea alleviation improvement exercise tolerance mean enhance quality life long term outcome population . Modern pharmacotherapy first step symptom management overall impact bronchodilator therapy relatively small . Exercise training remain effective treatment ameliorate dyspnea improve exercise endurance main focus study . The main objective study : 1 . To conduct compare detailed study respiratory mechanic cycle exercise exercise training ( EXT ) compare untrained control group . By multiple regression analysis , investigator establish main contributor dyspnea relief EXT . 2 . To compare magnitude change endurance constant work rate cycle exercise measure walk test endurance shuttle walk test EXT relative control . To evaluate test ( constant work rate cycle , six-minute walk test , endurance shuttle walk test ) sensitive test measuring change endurance EXT versus control . 3 . To compare change standardized dyspnea rating ( Borg Scale ) constant-load cycle variety activity-related dyspnea questionnaire . To evaluate measurement sensitive examine change perceive discomfort exercise . 4 . To evaluate contribution psychological factor ( anxiety , fear , respiratory panic , self-efficacy ) perceive improvement symptom follow EXT . The investigator use multiple regression analysis examine association change perceive dyspnea change anxiety self-efficacy measure validated questionnaire Borg intensity rating ?</brief_summary>
