	<brief_summary>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) one prevalent mental illness North America , 30 % - 40 % fail respond conventional treatment . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) show effective therapeutic tool treatment MDD . This form treatment involve series magnetic pulse direct brain 30 minute . Importantly , treatment safe well tolerate . However , date , treatment study show modest efficacy due limitation , include : 1 ) treatment deliver one side brain ; 2 ) treatment directly target specific brain region associate depression ; 3 ) treatment short duration ; 4 ) treatment insufficient intensity ; 5 ) insufficient understand brain mechanism responsible therapeutic effect . This study design directly address limitation , well explore brain mechanism ( e.g . cortical excitability ) treatment optimize .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Resistant Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study demonstrate rTMS efficacious treatment treatment resistant major depressive disorder ( TRD ) . However , recent meta-analyses , recent , large , multi-centre study , provide evidence suggest rTMS , best , provide modest therapeutic efficacy compare sham stimulation . Several reason may account modest therapeutic effect . First , majority study involve left-sided treatment alone dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , significant limitation consider electroconvulsive therapy - another form brain stimulation use TRD - show less efficacious use unilaterally , compare bilaterally . Second , sub-optimal method utilized target DLPFC ( i.e. , ' 5-cm anterior method ' ) , limit treatment potential inherently target form treatment . In regard , recent data investigator suggest treatment directly target DLPFC provide enhanced therapeutic efficacy compare ' 5-cm anterior ' method . Third , treatment duration typically short ( i.e. , 2-4 week ) . Fourth , stimulation intensity may insufficient take consideration coil-to-cortex distance , particular importance consider parameter may contribute significantly rTMS-induced antidepressant response . Fifth , study examine TRD across lifespan way address difference old young adult . Therefore , investigator propose conduct study evaluate efficacy rTMS TRD directly address 5 major limitation . This study compare bilateral rTMS unilateral rTMS involve target DLPFC use cortical co-registration technique , well treatment optimal duration ( i.e. , 6 week ) intensity parameter ( i.e. , adjust coil-to-cortex distance ) . The use distance cortical co-registration adjustment coil-to-cortex distance address major limitation ( lack stimulation intensity compensate age-related prefrontal atrophy ) study examine rTMS elderly sample . Preliminary data research group provide compel evidence rTMS may , indeed , effective limitation optimize young old adult . Finally , also essential research investigate mechanism therapeutic efficacy , increase understand translate enhanced treatment . For several reason , cortical excitability may represent neurophysiological process therapeutic effect rTMS mediate . Recent advance electroencephalography ( EEG ) technology permit direct measurement excitability DLPFC ; thus , able ascertain whether mechanisms therapeutic effect rTMS TRD mediate . Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : Treatment bilateral high frequency leave rTMS ( HFL-rTMS ) result great reduction 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D17 ) score compare sham rTMS . Hypothesis 2 : Bilateral rTMS result significantly great number patient reach criterion therapeutic response remission HAM-D17 compare unilateral sham rTMS . Hypothesis 3 : An increase excitability follow HFL-rTMS leave DLPFC ( case bilateral rTMS HFL-rTMS ) decrease excitability follow low frequency right-rTMS ( LFR-rTMS ; case bilateral rTMS ) right DLPFC mediate relationship rTMS response TRD . Finally , induction gamma activity follow rTMS associate improved treatment efficacy . Hypothesis 4 : rTMS result improve executive function patient age 60 TRD .</detailed_description>
