	<brief_summary>The investigator test whether pain decrease observe centrally non-invasive brain image CBP subject receive Lidoderm . The investigator first test effect 5 % Lidoderm patch open label trial . Next investigator compare effect Lidocaine versus Placebo patch . Three time point evaluate : baseline ( treatment ) 6 hour 2 week treatment . The latter trial 2 arm , double blind , placebo control trial , participant either received Lidoderm placebo patch , without cross .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Lidoderm Chronic Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous data show Lidoderm patch contain 5 % Lidocaine apply affected area period 1-2 week decrease chronic pain . We conduct preliminary open-label trial chronic back pain patient find patient report reduction pain intensity associate brain activity ( measure fMRI ) . As next step , conduct double blind clinical trial drug test placebo determine whether effect CBP mediate pharmacological mechanism . For obtained psychophysical measurement pain measure brain activity use fMRI . Two scan treatment ( 6 hour 2 week treatment ) conduct observe effect short term long term use . Brain activity measure non-invasive method functional imaging ( fMRI ) , enable examination cortical blood flow pain rating . These brain scan acquire chronic back pain patient rat ongoing chronic pain use finger span device . In control task , patient also rat change length bar n screen ( visual control task ) . Anatomical scan also acquire . The general design study CBP subject assess fmri brain response ongoing pain three time point . The initial ( baseline ) scan occur minimum 48 hour period patient refrain take analgesic medication . The patient next scanned 6 hour treatment 2 week continuous treatment . Subjects randomise placebo Lidoderm ( Lidoderm placebo patch supply Endo Pharmaceuticals ) .</detailed_description>
