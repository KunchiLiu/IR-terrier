	<brief_title>S1105 : Text-Messaging Intervention Reduce Early Discontinuation AI Therapy Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy reminder message , send text message mobile phone twice weekly , improve adherence adjuvant aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy determine urinary AI level woman early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer versus usual care . Secondary - To compare effect reminder message send twice weekly mobile phone compare usual care improve adherence adjuvant AI therapy accord self-report . - To explore efficacy text message intervention reduce early discontinuation compare usual care 12 , 24 , 36 month adjuvant AI therapy subgroup breast cancer patient define age group , stage , year therapy , education , race/ethnicity , teach hospital versus community hospital , AI-related side effect ( determine serial questionnaire ) , insurance status , prescription co-pay status . - To explore reason early discontinuation AI therapy discontinue intervention control group query quality life assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscales ( FACT-ES ) symptom issue related hormonal therapy follow-up visit , use Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI-SF ) , annual visit Beliefs Medicine Questionnaire ( BQM ) Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) . - To conduct sensitivity analysis assess time last evidence adherence . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord length time aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) ( &lt; 12 month v 12-24 month ) , type AI ( anastrozole v letrozole v exemestane ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo text message education checklist involve confirmation cellular telephone capability receive text message , retrieve read message , include confirmation evaluation , baseline time patient obtain new cellular telephone . Patients receive text message twice week 8 o'clock morning ( time zone ) 3 year . - Arm II : Patients receive standard follow-up care . Patients undergo urine sample collection baseline periodically study aromatase inhibitor level analysis future translational study . Patients complete Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscales ( FACT-ES ) , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI-SF ) , Beliefs Medicine Questionnaire ( BQM ) , Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) questionnaires baseline periodically study . Patients arm I also complete Cell Phone Text Messaging Use Questionnaire baseline periodically study . In arm , patient follow every 3 month 3 year registration .</detailed_description>
