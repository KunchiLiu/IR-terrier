	<brief_summary>Patients Alagille Syndrome ( AGS ) also frequently blockages ( `` stenosis '' ) pulmonary artery . Little known degree variability stenosis , effect disease right ventricle ( chamber heart pump blood lung ) . This study first quantify describe pulmonary artery stenosis patient Alagille Syndrome . The study also assess effect stenosis right ventricle . The investigator hope learn degree characteristic pulmonary artery stenosis Alagille Syndrome . The investigator also hope learn effect pulmonary artery stenosis right ventricle patient Alagille Syndrome . This information critical management patient Alagille syndrome , currently data guide clinicians management pulmonary artery stenosis . Furthermore , information study may help physician manage pulmonary artery stenosis patient well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hope learn degree characteristic pulmonary artery stenosis Alagille Syndrome . We also hope learn effect pulmonary artery stenosis right ventricle patient Alagille Syndrome . This information critical management patient Alagille syndrome , currently data guide clinicians management pulmonary artery stenosis . Furthermore , information study may help physician manage pulmonary artery stenosis patient well . For third aim , hope learn different blood vessel abnormality brain , abnormality likely lead stroke .</detailed_description>
