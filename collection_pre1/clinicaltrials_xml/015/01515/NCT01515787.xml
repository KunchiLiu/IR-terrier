	<brief_summary>The standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer involve chemotherapy radiation , know 5FUCMT , ( chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine radiation therapy ) prior surgery . Although radiation therapy pelvis standard important part treatment rectal cancer show decrease risk cancer come back area pelvis , patient experience undesirable side effect radiation important advance chemotherapy , surgery , radiation may benefit . The purpose study compare effect , good bad , standard treatment chemotherapy radiation chemotherapy use combination regimen know FOLFOX , ( drug 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , oxaliplatin leucovorin ) selective use standard treatment , depend response FOLFOX . The drug FOLFOX regimen FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) approve use routinely treat patient advanced colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PROSPECT : Chemotherapy Alone Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase II/III study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) randomize 1 2 treatment regimen . Patients receive full supportive care study . OBJECTIVES : Primary 1 . Phase II component : To assure neoadjuvant FOLFOX follow selective use 5FUCMT group ( Group 1 ) maintain current high rate pelvic R0 resection consistent non-inferiority time local recurrence ( TLR ) . 2 . Phase III component : To compare neoadjuvant FOLFOX follow selective use 5FUCMT ( Group 1 ) standard 5FUCMT ( Group 2 ) respect co-primary endpoint Time Local Recurrence ( TLR ) Disease-Free Survival ( DFS ) . Secondary 1 . To determine neoadjuvant FOLFOX follow selective use 5FUCMT ( Group 1 ) non-inferior standard group 5FUCMT ( Group 2 ) respect proportion patient achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) time surgical resection . 2 . To determine neoadjuvant FOLFOX follow selective use 5FUCMT ( Group 1 ) non-inferior standard 5FUCMT ( Group 2 ) respect overall survival . 3 . To evaluate compare adverse event profile surgery complication two group . 4 . To estimate proportion patient selective group ( Group 1 ) receive : 1 ) pre-operative 5FUCMT ; 2 ) post-operative 5FUCMT ; 3 ) either pre- post-operative 5FUCMT . Event monitoring patient continue 8 year post randomization .</detailed_description>
