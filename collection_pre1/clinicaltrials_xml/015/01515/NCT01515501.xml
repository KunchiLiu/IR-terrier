	<brief_title>Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Diagnosis a-Ganglionosis , Controlled Prospective Trial ( EDGE Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Adult pediatric patient present chronic constipation and/or motility disorder may refer rectal biopsy rule aganglionosis Hirschsprung 's disease . The traditional diagnostic test , rectal suction biopsy , blind technique insensitive confirm diagnosis . Frequently , patient require subsequent referral surgical full thickness biopsy . Hypothesis : Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) improve diagnostic yield aganglionosis decrease need subsequent surgical full thickness biopsy . Methods : This prospective , single center , control investigation EMR diagnosis colonic aganglionosis / Hirschsprung 's disease . Patients offer rectal suction biopsy offer enrollment . Enrolled patient one additional procedure ( EMR ) time rectal suction biopsy . Specimens analyze pathologically size , submucosal tissue adequacy , presence ganglionic tissue , positivity acetylcholinesterase staining . The adequacy tissue specimen , proportion diagnostic specimen , proportion patient would require subsequent referral full thickness biopsy , compare . Variable cost recovery time compare . Biopsy result compare patient 's pre-endoscopy clinical data include history constipation , result SITZ marker study , Bristol stool scale , anorectal manometry . Results : The primary outcome variable proportion patient diagnostic specimen group . Secondary outcome variable include size specimen , presence ganglionic tissue , presence submucosal tissue , positivity acetylcholinesterase stain . The biopsy result also correlate patient 's clinical data include clinical history , Bristol stool scale , anorectal manometry result , SITZ marker study . Cost recovery time compare . Discussion : The propose investigation may demonstrate simple endoscopic test , use direct visualization , improve diagnostic yield rectal biopsy Hirschsprung 's disease , spare patient additional surgical full thickness rectal biopsy .</detailed_description>
