	<brief_title>Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate Children With Moderate Severe Asthma Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present Emergency Department acute asthma exacerbation receive standard care three dos albuterol ipratropium bromide plus oral steroid medication . Those seven year age old require treatment screen eligibility . Eligibility screen comprise measurement force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) bedside spirometer respiratory therapist . Children age seven generally unable complete spirometry maneuver thus exclude . The Pediatric Asthma Severity Score ( PASS ) also note respiratory therapist . Patients able complete spirometry test FEV1 le 70 % predict ( definition moderate asthma exacerbation ) enrol . Enrolled patient randomize receive either Children 's Medical Center standard care 15 mg albuterol dilute 22 ml normal saline study intervention 15 mg albuterol dilute 22 ml magnesium sulfate solution . This solution prepare time use pharmacist Emergency Department consist 22 ml commercially available 40 mg/ml magnesium sulfate solution ( 880 mg ) . The nebulizer treatment give approximately one hour via large volume nebulizer 25 ml/hr . Physicians , nurse , respiratory therapist blind diluent use . Vital sign note baseline . Heart rate , heart rhythm , respiratory rate , pulse oximetry monitor continuously blood pressure measure baseline every 15 minute study medication administration . The study physician , treat physician , and/or bedside nurse monitor value clinically significant change . At end 15 mg albuterol treatment FEV1 PASS note . Any treatment need , determine treat physician , give follow Children 's Medical Center standard care . At discretion treat physician intravenous magnesium sulfate may use post study intervention . The dose use study participant Children 's Medical Center standard dose 75 mg/kg ( max 3 g ) minus 880 mg avoid risk magnesium sulfate overdose . Further treatment patient disposition observe study personnel note . Bounce-back rate collect review enrol patient ' medical record .</detailed_description>
