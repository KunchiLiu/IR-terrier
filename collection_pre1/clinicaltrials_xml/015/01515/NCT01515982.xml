	<brief_summary>The state art regard neurodegenerative dementia , especially Alzheimer´s disease ( AD ) , progression still irreversible cause cognitive , motor , behavioral impairment . Although current pharmacological treatment attenuate cognitive decline case , majority treatment avoid motor functional change cause progress disease . Although several study show exercise positive effect come treatment disease , methodological question affect application training protocol . The use recognize intensity pattern like maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) maximum heart rate ( HRmax ) percentage control training patient dementia still rare literature . Therefore , seem interfere definition ideal prescription . Following line reason , purpose present study assess effect moderate aerobic exercise cognition functional ability AD patient . Design : Randomized controlled trial , double-blinded , 16-week follow-up . Setting : Center Alzheimer 's disease Institute Psychiatry Federal University Rio de Janeiro . Participants : Elderly Alzheimer disease . Interventions : The patient randomly assign exercise group ( EG ) treadmill ( 30 minute , twice week moderate intensity 60 % VO2max ) control group ( CG ) . Main outcome measure : Cognitive function assess use CAMCOG , Trail Making Test A , Digit Span , Stroop Test , Rey auditory-verbal learn test Clock Test , functional capacity evaluate use Berg Balance Scale ( BERG ) , Sit-to-Stand test ( STS ) , functional reach test ( FR ) , time go test ( TUGT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Design : Four-month controlled , randomize , double-blind study . The patient recruit trained psychiatrist Center Alzheimer 's disease Institute Psychiatry Federal University Rio de Janeiro ( IPUB/UFRJ ) . They randomize blind design exercise group ( EG ) control group ( CG ) researcher participate initial assessment . - Intervention On completion baseline assessment , patient invite engage exercise program . Those accept take part available , easy access facility , include sample . The one include control group . So , subject divide two group : medical care ( control ) medical care + physical exercise . 1 . Medical care control group ( C ) : Subjects maintain clinical treatment . 2 . Medical care + exercise group ( E ) : This group prescribe exercise treatment adjunctive intervention drug therapy . Patients accept participate group evaluate thorough clinical exam rest electrocardiogram . The training exercise intensity establish 60 % VO2máx . This intensity determine use exercise prescription guideline establish American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . Each aerobic session begin 10-minute warm-up period ( 40 % VO2máx ) , follow 20 minute continuous treadmill walk intensity establish 60 % VO2máx , accord ACMS guideline ( 2006 ) . The exercise session conclude five minute cool . Heart hate ( Polar® Sport Tester , Finland ) perceive exertion ( Borg Scale ) monitor record five minute exercise session physical education instructor . Subjects encourage attend two supervised exercise session per week 16 week .</detailed_description>
