	<brief_summary>Molecular monitoring conduct blood cell , plasma sample , urine sample and/or tissue patient kidney transplantation . In present study investigator examine hypothesis noninvasive diagnostic molecular monitoring improve outcome transplantation . Routine clinical laboratory data serum urine evaluate baseline 0-1-2-3-4-12-16-52 week 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 year kidney transplantation . Mononuclear cell obtain blood transcript several diagnostic gene ( include GATA3 ( Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor3 ) , GATA4 ( Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor4 ) , GAPDH ( Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) , TRPC3 ( Transient receptor potential cononical type3 ) , TRPC6 ( Transient receptor potential cononical type6 ) , granzyme B , perforin , FOXP3 ( Forkhead box P3 ) , ISG15 ( Interferon-stimulated gene 15 ) , Mx1 ( Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein ) , MMP3 ( Matrix metalloproteinase-3 ) , MMP9 ( Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ) , long-non-coding RNA , others ) quantify use standard quantitative RT-PCR ( Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ) technique . Proteomic analysis perform plasma urine sample . Polymorphisms select gene analyze use standard technique . Data analyze descriptive statistic . Differences group analyze use Mann-Whitney test Kruskal-Wallis-test Dunn ` multiple comparison post-test , appropriate . Associations variable analyze use regression analysis . Contingency table analyze use Fisher 's exact test .</brief_summary>
