	<brief_title>A Trial 18F-AV-133 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective protocol address feasibility development VMAT2-binding compound 18F-AV-133 diagnostic radiopharmaceutical field diabetes . Specifically , study evaluate 18F-AV-133 imaging patient type 1 diabetes , patient type 2 diabetes healthy control order : 1 . Obtain information regard safety 18F-AV-133 population ; 2 . Determine whether uptake , distribution , clearance 18F-AV-133 pancreas differs subject predict reduced beta cell mass ( patient type 1 type 2 diabetes long duration ) normal beta cell mass ( healthy volunteer ) ; 3 . Evaluate PET image pharmacokinetics 18F-AV-133 abdominal organ healthy control subject patient type 1 type 2 diabetes ; 4 . Obtain preliminary information regard appropriate time window optimal PET image 18F-AV-133 pancreas post-administration type 1 , type 2 , normal healthy individual ; 5 . Obtain preliminary information regard appropriate reference tissue evaluate PET image result 18F-AV-133 pancreas ; 6 . Evaluate image property 18F-AV-133 pancreas relative brain subset subject .</detailed_description>
