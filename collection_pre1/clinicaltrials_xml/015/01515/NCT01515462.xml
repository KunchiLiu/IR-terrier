	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) X-linked primary immunodeficiency cause mutation WAS gene encodes WAS protein ( WASP ) , cytoskeletal regulator express exclusively hematopoietic cell . We expect treat 8 patient genetically modify autologous hematopoietic stem cell collect bone marrow and/or mobilized peripheral blood , transduce lentiviral vector encoding WAS . The patient select accord disease severity ( genetic mutation , WASP expression clinical score ) , absence human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -identical sibling adequate unrelated donor , age clinical feature . A condition regimen base low dos iv busulfan ( non-myeloablative ) , Fludarabine anti-CD20 antibody administer patient make space bone marrow gene correct stem cell , deplete lymphoid compartment potentially autoreactive lymphocyte prevent lymphoproliferative disorder . Patients autoimmune manifestation could also receive ATG Thymoglobuline target auto-reactive memory T lymphocytes . This reduced intensity conditioning schedule provide less toxicity current preparatory regimen , use standard allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The treated patient follow 3 year thereafter monitor efficacy safety additional 5 year .</detailed_description>
