	<brief_title>Analysing Differences Glycaemic Control Immediately Post Obesity SurgEry ( The ADIPOSE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective propose study track glycaemic control real-time use state art continuous blood glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) immediately surgery pin-point exact timing improvement glycaemic control . The main secondary objective association change glycaemic control change level incretin hormone ( GLP-1 GIP ) . Study Design This prospective pilot study investigate effect bariatric surgery measure glycaemic control incretin level . Aims We aim : ) temporally characterise change glycaemic control obese people undergo bariatric surgery use state art continuous blood glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) ii ) explore putative relationship incretins improved glycaemic control iii ) explore change subjective appetite use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) appetite palatability Data Collection Baseline ( V 1 ) Return CGMS Day surgery ( V 2 ) + 8 week ( V 3 ) Return CGMS CGMS ( 5 day ) √ √ √ Standard meal test plus associated fasting postprandial blood √ √ Appetite &amp; palatability* ( VAS ) *5 √ √ ( appetite VAS ) √ Exercise questionnaire IPAQ √ √ BP √ √ Waist , hip , weight height √ √ Family &amp; medical history √ Table 1 : Data collect study time point . V = visit number . * visit 1 3 palatability assessment i.e . conduct conjunction standard meal test . Visit 1 : The baseline pre-operative visit ( - 3 week ) Informed write consent obtain either preoperative assessment visit appointment Leicester Diabetes Centre schedule surgery . Informed consent follow baseline measure include fast blood sample analysis lipid profile , insulin , HBA1c , glucose level . Blood pressure , body weight , height waist circumference take record participant case report file . Each participant complete two visual analogue scale , one appetite one palatability . Medical family history additionally record ( table 1 ) . Patient 's glycaemic status assess HbA1c time referral . According 2011 World Health Organisation guideline HbA1c use diagnostic test diabetes , provide stringent quality assurance test place assay standardise criterion align international reference value [ 20 ] . The advised HbA1c cut-point ≥6.5 % employ study . Each participant additionally undergo 5 day ' CGMS detail . The participant return either LRI diabetes department removal CGMS data upload onto password protected PC . Upon return monitor participant undergo standard meal test follow 30 minute blood sampling ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute ) purpose profile GLP-1 , GIP , PYY , leptin , ghrelin , insulin glucose . At time-point 0 sample also take analysis vitamin C level provide indication subject 's diet i.e . level fruit vegetable intake . A sample also take measure vitamin D , wide range plasma proteins metabolite also carry sample use proteomic metabolimic analysis . If participant prefers , timeline demand due imminence surgery , visit take place day . The CGMS fit standard meal test conduct . Visit 2 : Post-operative day surgery A fast blood sample obtain morning surgery quantification glucose , insulin full lipid profile . Immediately surgery participant leave theatre CGMS recording repeat . CGMS conduct patient 's surgery due metal component glucose sensor potentially diathermic property i.e . electrically induced heat surround tissue could lead serious injury . Visit 3 : post-operative + 8weeks At 8 week post surgery patient stable 900 - 1200 kcal diet i.e . part post-operative routine care +8 week follow surgery patient without complication reintroduce solid diet . At point baseline data include HbA1c collect participant 5 day CGMS fit remove either LRI diabetes department member research team data upload password-protected PC . Again return monitor participant undergo standard meal test follow 30 minute blood sampling ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 120minutes ) purpose profile GLP-1 , GIP , PYY , Ghrelin , leptin , insulin glucose . Again sample obtain time-point 0 quantification Vitamin C , vitamin D plasma proteins metabolite . Standardising consumption pre-meal test . The gut hormone investigate exceptionally sensitive caffeine , smoke differential nutritional caloric load [ 30 ] . Therefore order standardise test change observe visit compromise subject prior eat habit ask abstain smoke consume caffeine 48 hour meal test . Furthermore , provide subject meal replacement drink ( Resource® 2.0 Fibre ) consume place even meal night appointment request abstain ingest anything water appointment follow morning . This 200ml meal replacement contain calorie 400 kcal comprises 42.8g carbohydrate , 17.4g fat 5g fibre therefore provide sufficient calorific nutritional content replace main evening meal . Study Outcomes Primary Outcome The primary outcome time take glycaemic shift observe , measure CGMS . The mean proportion ( % ) time spend either ( ≥10mmol/l ) , ( ≤3.1mmol/l ) within ( 3.2 -9.9mmol/l ) predefined glycaemic range calculate participant record period adjust 24 hour . A glycaemic shift context define statistically ( p &lt; 0.05 ) significant reduction increase proportion time spend within glycaemic range i.e . shift hyperglycaemic normoglycaemic range . It argue blood glucose level &lt; 3.9mmol/l defined hypoglycaemic however low threshold &lt; 3.1mmol/l select hypoglycaemic cut point study . This although physiological response evident level &lt; 3.9mmol/l , include reduction endogenous insulin increase pancreatic glucagon secretion [ 21 ] , actually blood glucose level drop &lt; 3.9 mmol/l healthy individual , without clinically significant outcome , particularly woman . Thus definition potentially lead estimation clinically significant hypoglycaemic event . Blood glucose level &lt; 3.1 mmol/l result autonomic ( sweat shake ) neuroglycopenic symptom ( confusion , incoordination , speech difficulty ) [ 22,23 ] . A number study use definition determine hypoglycaemic event people diabetes mellitus [ 24-26 ] . The threshold ≥ 10 mmol/l select hyperglycaemic range blood glucose level magnitude associate T2DM complication thus main objective diabetes management keep blood glucose level threshold aim maintain blood glucose level around 7 mmol/l patient . Secondary Outcomes There number secondary outcome study list : 1 . The time take change number hyperglycaemic event ( ≥ 10.0 mmol/l duration ≥ 10 minute ) observe ( adjusted 24 hour ) 2 . The time take change duration hyperglycaemic event ( minute ) observe 3 . The time take change number hypoglycaemic event ( ≤ 3.1 mmol/l duration ≥ 10 minute ) observe ( adjusted 24 hour ) 4 . The time take change duration hypoglycaemic event ( minute ) observe 5 . The change area curve GLP-1 , GIP , PYY , ghrelin , insulin , glucose leptin profile visit 1 2 3 6 . The change fasting level GIP visit 1 - 2 2 - 3 7 . The change fasting level insulin visit 1 - 2 2 - 3 8 . The change Hba1c visit 1 3 9 . The change fast glucose level visit 1 3 10 . The change mean amplitude glycaemic excursion ( MAGE ) visit 1 3 11 . The change subjective appetite visit 1 - 3 course hospital stay 12 . The change subjective palatability meal test visit 1 - 3 13 . The change level vitamin C visit 1 - 3 14 . The change level vitamin D visit 1 - 3 15 . The change plasma proteins visit 1 , 2 3 16 . The change plasma metabolites visit 1,2 3 NB : 1 - 4 calculated change visit 1 - 2 , visit 1 - 3 2 - 3 . HbA1c test conduct visit 1 visit 3 confirm presence/remission pre- overt diabetes . We additionally collect standard demographic data ethnicity , age , family history T2DM CHD/CVD , BMI , body weight , waist hip circumference systolic diastolic blood pressure . We seek consent participant access medical note record data may relevant study . Sample Size We aim recruit 20 obese patient await either gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy Leicester Royal Infirmary . This pilot study therefore require formal power calculation . However , recently publish trial assessed glycaemic control 10 obese individual T2DM 7 day surgery use standard liquid meal follow blood sample 0 , 30,60,90 120 minute [ 19 ] . This group able detect improvement glycaemic control despite small sample size . With 90 surgery take place Leicester Royal Infirmary 2010 approximately 65 currently wait list feel achievable relevant light exist evidence recruit target number 20 patient . Statistical Analysis The analysis descriptive nature , comprehensively phenotype sample rather compare group . Therefore , statistical test perform . For primary outcome mean time glycaemic shift 95 % confidence interval calculate . For secondary outcome participant act control data analyse use change baseline . Results report mean ( % % CI ) continuous measure count ( percentage ) categorical . For hypothesis generation analysis repeat type surgery . Standard operate procedure We collect study measure line Leicester Diabetes Research Group standard operating procedure .</detailed_description>
