	<brief_summary>Obesity cause 600 premature death per week UK exist treatment effective . When human eat , bowel naturally secrete chemical bloodstream make people feel full stop eating . One chemical know Peptide YY ( PYY ) . The investigator previously show injection PYY reduce appetite food intake human volunteer . The investigator develop similar chemical , Y242 , treatment obesity . Y242 test animal show safe , reduce appetite , last much long PYY . This study test Y242 ensure well tolerated human , see long last blood stream inject skin . It also look effect appetite .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Study Y242 Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity cause 600 premature death per week UK exist treatment less ideal . Intravenous infusion hormone call PYY reduces food intake effect last hour cause nausea . Y242 longacting analogue PYY . Given subcutaneously rodent , profile action least 72 hour strongly inhibit food intake . It cause weight loss without behavioural effect . With MRC funding , Y242 pass Good Laboratory Practice toxicology test present proposal first human study investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics overweight otherwise healthy men . The study combine single ascend dose ( part A ) multiple ascend dose ( part B ) Phase 1 investigation . The primary objective investigate safety tolerability . The secondary objective ass Y242 's pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile . Possible effect food consumption explore . For part A 48 subject plan , 40 subject part B . In part subject divide group , dose level , start single dose ( part A ) much low expect cause effect . Subjects admit Unit closely observe adverse effect safety test , blood concentration drug food liquid intake output monitor . Subjects allocate random ( like toss coin ) receive Y242 placebo ( dummy ) . Safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic data summarise available result consider decide dose escalation , stop rule design enable u explore relationship dose adverse effect ( eg nausea ) without cause unacceptable nausea symptom volunteer .</detailed_description>
