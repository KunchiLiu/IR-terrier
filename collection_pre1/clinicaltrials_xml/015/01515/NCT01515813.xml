	<brief_summary>Since people start take HIV medication , illness related AIDS decrease , serious illness like heart disease ( heart attack ) certain kind cancer increase . Studies show HIV cause change line artery also cause inflammation ( irritation ) inside body may play role disease like heart attack stroke . The level inflammation artery line health also affect well brain work . These change felt , measure . Artery line health look test use blood pressure cuff arm see artery responds air let cuff . An ultrasound ( machine use sound wave ) use look artery test . This test call Flow Mediated Dilation FMD short . Inflammation check blood test ( blood test measure irritation inside body feel ) . HIV medication improve artery line health partially low level inflammation blood ; however , level inflammation may able return back normal . Pravastatin sodium medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat high cholesterol . Pravastatin sodium also able improve health lining artery low level inflammation people disease , study approve purpose people HIV . This research study look effect two type medication use separately together health lining artery level inflammation blood : Atripla ( HIV medication ) pravastatin sodium . This study also look effect Atripla pravastatin sodium cholesterol level , test measure well think calculate ( test neurocognitive function ) , effect Atripla level pravastatin sodium blood .</brief_summary>
