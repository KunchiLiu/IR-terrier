	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give erlotinib dovitinib together treat patient metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib block epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) know activity non-small cell lung cancer dovitinib block fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) target may important treat lung cancer . The combination drug may work well either drug alone , may also increase side effect . This trial look side effect combine drug look effective combination may .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability combination erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) dovitinib ( dovitinib lactate ) , assess toxicity use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination erlotinib dovitinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) patient receive combination erlotinib dovitinib , although phase allow patient receive number prior treatment , include prior treatment erlotinib . II . To evaluate potential impact dovitinib erlotinib pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Starting day 15 , patient also receive dovitinib lactate PO QD day 1-5 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
