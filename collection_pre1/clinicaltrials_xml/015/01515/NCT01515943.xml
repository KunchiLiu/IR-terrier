	<brief_title>Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Study ( CITS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Convergence insufficiency ( CI ) common distinct binocular vision disorder affect approximately 4 % school age child adult United States . Convergence insufficiency often associate symptoms frequent loss place reading , loss concentration , re-read , read slowly , poor comprehension , sleepiness , blur vision , diplopia , headache , and/or eyestrain . A recently complete randomized clinical trial , Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial ( CITT ) , demonstrate 12-week program office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy home reinforcement effective home-based near target pencil push-ups , home-based computer accommodative therapy plus pencil push-ups , office-based placebo therapy treat symptom sign associate symptomatic CI child 9 17 year age . While home-based therapy CITT effective office-based vergence/accommodative therapy improvement note . Currently , many eye care professional offer home-based therapy , others suggest passive treatment base-in prism . At Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group ( PEDIG ) meeting ( Tampa , January 2009 ) , result poll attendee indicate large majority pediatric ophthalmologist continue recommend home-based near target push-ups initial treatment approach child symptomatic CI spite CITT result . There significant difference contact time , complexity , cost office-based home-based therapy CI . Many clinician believe less costly less complex treatment option attempt first . Although home-based therapy use computer software become popular , prospective data available demonstrate effectiveness home-based vision therapy use computer software compare home-based near target push-ups home-based placebo computer therapy . A prospective clinical trial therefore need determine effectiveness home-based computer therapy symptomatic CI compare traditional home-based near target push-ups placebo treatment . The current study multi-center randomize clinical trial evaluate effectiveness home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy home-based near target push-ups child 9 &lt; 18 year age symptomatic CI .</detailed_description>
