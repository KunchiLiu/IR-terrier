	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Dinaciclib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , B-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerable dose combination therapy ofatumumab dinaciclib ( phase 1b component ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , small lymphocytic leukemia ( SLL ) , B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( B-PLL ) . II . To characterize toxicity combination therapy ofatumumab dinaciclib CLL/SLL/B-PLL . III . To determine overall response rate associate treatment assess consensus response criterion . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination treatment ofatumumab dinaciclib . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics dinaciclib give combination ofatumumab . III . To correlate pharmacokinetic feature dinaciclib response , toxicity ( particularly tumor lysis syndrome ) , pharmacodynamic endpoint . IV . To perform detailed baseline serial pharmacodynamic study combination therapy ofatumumab dinaciclib correlate response therapy . V. To correlate baseline disease-risk parameter ( i.e. , zeta-chain-associated protein kinase [ ZAP ] -70 expression , interphase cytogenetics , immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region [ IgVH ] mutational analysis , clinical prognostic factor ) response therapy . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously ( IV ) 4-6 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1-2 , day 1 course 4-7 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 2 , 8 , 15 course 2 , day 1 , 8 , 15 course 3-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
