	<brief_summary>This trial originally design power compare biomarker modulation neo-adjuvant setting ( erlotinib versus erlotinib plus sulindac versus placebo ) clinical response erlotinib adjuvant setting . Since implement trial late 2005 , The investigator encounter significant obstacle implement adjuvant therapy phase trial . - Barriers include : 1. disease recurrence 2. patient refusal take agent 3. patient refusal travel Pittsburgh clinical evaluation . Given institutional challenge implement complete adjuvant portion , investigator decide change primary endpoint biomarker modulation endpoint . To achieve goal , investigator determine need 39 paired tissue specimen ( see statistical justification ) . The central hypothesis test study persistent activation parallel and/or downstream pathways contribute tumor progression set EGFR blockade . While head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) patient respond EGFR targeting , optimal strategy identify subject whose tumor sensitive EGFR inhibition remain unknown . The primary objective center around concept tumor biomarkers may modulate EGFR Cox-2 inhibitor may serve future therapeutic target therapy . To end patient trial randomly assign one three arm receive either Tarceva , Tarceva plus sulindac , placebo 2 week pre-operative period . A panel biomarkers obtain biopsy prior pre-operative therapy surgery . Biomarkers examine modulation 2-week pre-operative period , group difference , treatment effect understand protein signal pathway . Sample size primary objective Modification Statistical Design : The primary endpoint difference pre ( biopsy ) post ( surgery ) . There 3 hypothesis interest : ( 1 ) placebo vs erlotinib alone , ( 2 ) placebo versus erlotinib plus sulindac , ( 3 ) erlotinib v erlotinib + sulindac . With randomization 3:5:5 ratio , 88 % power , alpha = .01 omnibus test show between-group difference 1 log exist . This require 39 patient . Basically , 39 patient provide ability detect one log difference 2 3 group pre-post change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study TARCEVA ( Erlotinib ) Adjuvant Treatment Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) constitute 3 percent malignancy sixth common malignancy worldwide . There estimate 38,000 new case 11,000 death United States 2004 approximately 500,000 case worldwide yearly [ 1 ] . Squamous cell carcinoma account least 95 percent head neck cancer . Surgical treatment remain standard therapy patient resectable HNSCC . For patient high risk local distant relapse , radiation therapy ( RT ) alone , combination chemotherapy , give surgery improve loco-regional control overall survival . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient respectable HNSCC remain experimental option patient . A two-week delay definitive surgical resection patient operable HNSCC think impact clinical outcome patient many case may need complete preoperative work-up . As result , study design involve two-week preoperative course therapy patient operable HNSCC concern . EGFR therapeutic target HNSCC Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) 170-Kda transmembrane protein think important proliferation survival cancer cell [ 2 ] . Overexpression EGFR find several malignancy , include head neck , lung , breast , prostate , bladder , pancreatic cancer [ 3-7 ] . In HNSCC , EGFR ligand TGF overexpressed 80-90 % tumor compare normal mucosa ; [ 8 ] coexpression receptor ligand implicate autocrine regulatory pathway HNSCC carcinogenesis . The clinical relevance EGFR overexpression independent prognostic factor HNSCC well demonstrate . High tumor EGFR level correlate advanced stage , [ 9 ] increase tumor size , [ 9 ] decrease survival , [ 10-13 ] increase recurrence , [ 10 ] decrease sensitivity radiation treatment [ 14 ] . A recent study suggest high serum EGFR level may even correlate high head neck tumor grade [ 15 ] . The overexpression EGFR ligand partially fully transform HNSCC tissue , correlation poor clinical outcome , aberrant function EGFR network HNSCC provide compel evidence relationship EGFR development progression HNSCC , suggest role EGFR target cancer therapy . EGFR target extracellular domain block ligand binding , intracellular domain inhibit tyrosine kinase activity , genetic level target production receptor . EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody interfere ligand bind , conjugation EGFR ligand antibody bacterially derive toxin enables delivery cytotoxic agent cell surface . Many EGFR-targeting agent undergo clinical evaluation HNSCC . In general , clinical response HNSCC patient advance disease observe agent combine cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy . Clinical trial use EGFR inhibitor adjuvant therapy HNSCC currently underway .</detailed_description>
