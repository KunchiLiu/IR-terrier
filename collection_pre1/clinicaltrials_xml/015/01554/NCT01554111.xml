	<brief_title>Comparing Bowel Preparation Regimens Flexible Sigmoidoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Flexible sigmoidoscopy accept screen modality colorectal cancer , however , put significant strain endoscopy suite resource . It important flexible sigmoidoscopy do completely efficiently . Cleansing sigmoidoscopy important optimize diagnostic yield exam polyp detection rate colonic lesion . Rectal enemas mainstay sigmoidoscopy preparation many endoscopy suite . Procedure prolongation due requirement additional enema wash poorly cleanse colon put strain endoscopy time complete procedure . Oral preparation mainstay colonoscopy cleanse allow adequate visualization entire colon superior rectal enema regard . Large volume preparation dominate oral colon cleansing . Polyethylene glycol large volume solution osmotically balance laxative . Large volume prep poorly tolerate compare small volume preparation . Small volume osmotically active agent limitation also , use frequently new agent well safety profile . Few large control study look oral preparation give sigmoidoscopy . Tolerability oral prep negative impact patient compliance regimen colonoscopy . However , rectal enema also negative impact sigmoidoscopy experience . Many sigmoidoscopy incomplete poorly do due poor prep . Literature oral bowel preparation regimens do predominantly colonoscopy . The study compare oral preparation enemas do without validated method record bowel preparation adequately objectively ( 1 , 2 ) . The goal study compare quality bowel preparation oral preparation rectal enemas determine best . The investigator plan determine concentration combustible gas oral preparation sigmoidoscopy would reduce enough allow safe electrocautery use sigmoidoscopy . Hydrogen methane two major combustible gas find normal colon . These gas cause explosion bowel time sigmoidoscopy electrocautery use . The explosive range hydrogen air 4-74 % , methane range 5-15 % ( 3 ) . Levels combustible gas colon find unsafe bowel prepped two phosphosoda enema . ( 4 ) Several bowel cleanse regimen find safe electrocautery decrease concentration combustible gas colon . Our hypothesis partial oral bowel preparation , reduce concentration combustible gas colon low enough level make electrocautery safe flexible sigmoidoscopy . Objective Hypothesis : Our objective help determine efficacy oral rectal bowel preparation regimens sigmoidoscopy . Our hypothesis oral preparation reduce amount repeat rectal enema require improve quality bowel exam sigmoidoscopy .</detailed_description>
