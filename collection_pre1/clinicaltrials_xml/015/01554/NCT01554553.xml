	<brief_title>Longitudinal Sleeve Gastrectomy Study Comparing Posterior Crural Repair Versus No Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Longitudinal Sleeve gastrectomy type Bariatric surgery stomach divide vertically , reduce 25 % original size . Obesity independent risk factor Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) ; however observe bariatric surgical community many Longitudinal Sleeve Gastrectomy ( LSG ) patient complain persisted GERD symptom LSG surgery . The incidence GERD patient report high 26 % . GERD uncomfortable dangerous disease , remain unchecked , cause ulcer disease , esophagitis , even esophageal cancer . Because , bariatric surgeon want reduce incidence GERD LSG , lead multiple addition LSG procedure , currently examine , namely , combine fundoplication sleeve , band sleeve combine hiatal repair SG . However , randomize comparative clinical trial evaluate GERD endpoint LSG . Of possible solution treat increase reflux LSG , mention previously , repair hiatus time surgery make sense physiologically . LSG dissection require obliteration leave phrenoesophageal ligament hold GE junction place . This essentially create weakness hiatus lead hiatal hernia subsequent reflux disease . Crural repair time surgery strengthen GE junction reduces possibility hiatal hernia formation . Closing crus around esophagus may prevent sleeve herniating chest reduces occurrence reflux reposition GE junction it0s normal location abdomen .</detailed_description>
