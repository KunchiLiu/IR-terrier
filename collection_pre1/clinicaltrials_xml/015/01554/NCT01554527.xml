	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) affect least 2-3 % child may substantial adverse impact behavior cognition . Adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) , second common surgical procedure child , perform often suspect SDB indication . However , recent study among increasingly obese population show something alarm : many child still SDB AT , many still suffer residual neurobehavioral morbidity . Furthermore , investigator ' ongoing , 12-year , NIH-funded research show standard preoperative polysomnographic measure SDB consistently predict post-AT improvement behavior cognition . This may arise part many child AT still SDB , linear relationship standard SDB measure neurobehavioral morbidity may exist . Even subtle level , SDB may promote significant neurobehavioral morbidity . Some suggest polysomnography may important AT AT . However , practice child receive polysomnography AT , even few AT , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) could still provide definitive relief SDB . Preliminary data group suggest CPAP AT well-tolerated child may provide significant benefit . However , virtually publish evidence exist address critical clinical question : child benefit CPAP AT ; role clinical symptom polysomnography play determination ; neurobehavioral gain achieve CPAP AT ? The investigator therefore undertake highly practical , clinical study two main goal : ( 1 ) ass extent behavior , cognition , sleepiness child improve CPAP AT , ( 2 ) identify patient stand gain post-operative assessment treatment . This research use reversible SDB-related neurobehavioral morbidity criterion judge utility clinical symptom polysomnography identification candidate CPAP AT .</detailed_description>
