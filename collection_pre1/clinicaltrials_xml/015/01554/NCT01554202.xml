	<brief_summary>According estimation , Alzheimer 's disease affect approximately 860,000 people age 65 year France . This disease characterize disorder cognitive function , include memory , associate structural functional modification brain . These change evolve within pathology progression evaluate neuropsychological test ( assess capability language , orientation , etc . ) also brain imaging ( e.g . MRI ) . Alzheimer 's disease still poorly understood , nevertheless currently available treatment slow development disease diagnose early enough . Thus , objective identify marker early diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease , good describe evolution disease . The three main objective project - identify , compare combine predictive marker Alzheimer 's disease - make significant contribution understand pathophysiological mechanism Alzheimer 's disease - study ability different neuroimaging technique follow evolution pathology .</brief_summary>
