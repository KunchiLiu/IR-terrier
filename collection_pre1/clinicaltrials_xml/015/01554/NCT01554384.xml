	<brief_summary>Xpert MTB/RIF assay novel automate molecular tool diagnosis TB . Xpert detect TB genetic material sputum sample well test genetic resistance rifampicin provide result within 2 hour . Xpert receive WHO endorsement December 2010 . There limited data impact Xpert time-to-treatment TB-related patient morbidity primary care clinic . No study yet evaluate Xpert perform point-of-treatment ( POT ) i.e . primary care clinic location . The investigator hypothesize one sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay perform POT improve time-to-diagnosis , time-to-treatment TB related patient morbidity patient suspect TB present primary level TB clinic high HIV prevalent setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) one world 's important infectious cause mortality continue kill 1.8 million people annually . Despite intensified standard measure TB control , TB case detection rate low , pose major hurdle TB control . It estimate approximately 50 % patient TB still diagnose treat appropriately . The problem compound increase prevalence multi drug resistant ( MDR ) extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) TB close association TB HIV infection . Diagnostic tool introduce 100 year ago still routine use increasingly inaccurate face HIV TB syndemics . Consequently , many patient active TB remain undiagnosed continue spread disease within community . Thus , miss delay diagnosis result ongoing transmission , patient morbidity mortality , social economic consequence . Currently , available point-of-care , even point-of-treatment test allow early detection active tuberculosis peripheral health clinic level . Lack rapid , simple accurate diagnostic test level major hurdle control global burden TB . A number promise new TB diagnostics show initial promise remain urgent need assess impact use point-of-treatment primary care level . In 2009 , Cepheid release Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay , system able deliver answer directly unprocessed sample combine on-board preparation sample real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) less 2 hour . Additionally , Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay allow simultaneous on-demand molecular test detection mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) rifampicin ( frontline anti-TB drug ) resistance . . The GeneXpert™ system consist GeneXpert instrument , personal computer disposable fluidic cartridge . The system combine cartridge-based sample preparation amplification detection fully integrate automated nucleic acid analysis instrument . Xpert show accurate tool rapid diagnosis tuberculosis smear-positive smear-negative sample multicentre evaluation demonstration study sensitivity approximately 70 % smear negative culture positive TB . Xpert test study perform microscopy laboratory . In December 2010 , basis result , Xpert endorse TB diagnosis World Health Organisation ( WHO ) yet integrate national tuberculosis control program . Limited data available impact Xpert patient important outcome TB-related morbidity . No data available feasibility robustness perform Xpert primary care clinic POT use minimally trained nursing staff . The objective study examine feasibility impact single point-of-treatment Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Assay perform clinic staff compare standard microscopy-centre base diagnostics . Special focus patient-related outcome time-to-treatment initiation , drop rate mean difference TB-morbidity score patient diagnose Xpert . The Xpert POT study multicentre patient-level randomise control trial compare single sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay perform point-of-treatment same-day standard fluorescent smear microscopy TB diagnosis primary level care . A single liquid MGIT culture perform regional laboratory use reference standard .</detailed_description>
