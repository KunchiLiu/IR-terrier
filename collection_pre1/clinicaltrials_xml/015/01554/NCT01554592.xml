	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( cardiomyopathy ) chronic condition heart fail function pump move blood around body . This set complex physiologic response compensate , include activation many hormonal mechanism result fluid accumulation . In recent year , medication block hormonal response heart failure give standard drug , include ACE inhibitor beta blocker . Mortality reduce medication , well symptom improve . Other medication also use heart failure , clear-cut benefit demonstrate . Statins , also call HMG CoA reductase inhibitor , use reduce cholesterol level help prevent heart failure prevent heart attack . They use heart failure cause heart attack belief `` pleiotropic '' effect , mean beneficial effect heart failure separate reduction cholesterol . However large trial heart failure demonstrate statin increase survival compare placebo . There evidence recommend routine use establish heart failure cause either heart attack genetics . The investigator propose use statin heart failure unnecessary could stop . The importance find evidence cease unproven medication heart failure understate . Patients heart failure take average six prescription medication day . Each medication side effect interaction drug together unknown . Statins common reason side effect patient heart failure , cause muscle pain gastrointestinal upset . In study , investigator plan withdraw statin patient stable heart failure closely monitor environment watch effect heart failure feel generally .</brief_summary>
