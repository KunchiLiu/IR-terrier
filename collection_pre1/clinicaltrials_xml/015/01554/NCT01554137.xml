	<brief_summary>Stroke ( CVA ) lead cause death lead cause disability develop country develop country ( WHO , 2000 ) . In aftermath stroke , patient keep permanent disability 75 % case one quarter able resume work . The post stroke sequelae sensory-motor cognitive . According literature data , 75-83 % patient survive stroke learn walk 25 45 % recover use upper limb activity daily live ( Friedman , 1990 ) . The existence phase call `` plateau '' motor recovery stroke suggest ( Colautti , 2001 ) . This would occur beyond 4 th month would correspond phase rehabilitation technique use subacute phase deem less effective . Recently , Page ( 2004 ) speculate plateau phase rather consequence adaptation type patient follow-up training limit possibility recovery . In observational study recovery upper limb conduct period 4 year , Broeks ( 2004 ) show possible recovery beyond 16 week post stroke . The result study different technique rehabilitation chronic stroke patient tend confirm hypothesis page . Therefore , vary training parameter ( type , intensity , frequency ) could improve functional capability patient , even distance stroke . Strength train part management hemiparetic patient . The result several study show improvement muscle strength functional ability walk building program isokinetic low limb ( Sharp , 1997 ) . The objective project evaluate effectiveness build program isokinetic muscle paretic limb motor recovery hemiparetic patient 6 month stroke .</brief_summary>
