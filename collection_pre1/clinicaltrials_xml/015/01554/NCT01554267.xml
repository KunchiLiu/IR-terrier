	<brief_summary>In investigator previous study 51 breast reconstruction ( 32 patient ) , compare three different assessment vascular perfusion tissue ; clinical judgment , fluorescein dye angiography ( FDA ) laser-assisted indocyanine green dye angiography ( ICG ) . Because tissue poor perfusion become necrotic compromise success breast reconstruction , important tissue poor perfusion remove time reconstructive surgery . However , also important remove least amount potentially necrotic tissue possible breast reconstruction compromise lack skin . Therefore find best way ass potentially necrotic tissue vital clinical question . In initial study 3 different assessment method make time surgery compare subsequent development necrotic tissue . In initial study , clinical judgment basis determine tissue remove potential become necrotic . The investigator collect data FDA system ICG system , data use make clinical decision . The study follow progression tissue overt necrosis clinical outcome compare prediction make three different assessment strategy . The investigator find clinical judgment fail detect tissue subsequently become necrotic 21 51 instance failure rate 41 % . The FDA system predict large area potentially necrotic tissue clinical judgment , find over-predict area become necrotic 82 % - 88 % ( 88 % case include 82 % case subsequently develop necrosis include ) . Although ICG system similar FDA system dye use assess perfusion , ICG system enhance software improves estimate perfusion . The ICG system provide 90 % sensitivity 100 % specificity predict vs. actual necrotic tissue specific absolute perfusion unit value . Hypothesis : Using value absolute perfusion unit discover previous study implement use operating room decrease all-inclusive necrosis rate 10 % , reflect 31 % decrease investigator necrosis rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator current rate development all-inclusive mastectomy skin necrosis approximately 41 % . This mean current method clinical assessment fail identify region mastectomy skin poor blood flow lead necrosis 41 % patient . The investigator know use SPY image system sensitive necrosis clinical assessment . With SPY Q analysis investigator hope obtain 90 % sensitivity , 100 % specificity absolute perfusion unit value identify previous study . The investigator anticipate obtain 0 % all-inclusive necrosis rate believe eliminate clinically significant necrosis would result operative debridement removal implant . The less severe form necrosis include epidermolysis incisional necrosis self-limiting usually require invasive intervention .</detailed_description>
