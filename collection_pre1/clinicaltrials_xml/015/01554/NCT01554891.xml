	<brief_summary>The current study evaluate initial reliability validity new instrument , INTRuST Structured Assessment Evaluation TBI ( SAFE-TBI ) , three sample Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) veteran . The SAFE-TBI relatively brief measure develop INTRuST consortium investigator design give trained administrator . It allow determination level evidence exposure mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) use follow category : Strong , Moderate , Weak , No Evidence mild TBI . The first objective determine reliability ( test-retest inter-rater ) sample 100 veteran recently return deployment Joint Base Lewis-McChord Fort Bragg ( Cohort 1 ) , screen positive TBI Post-Deployment Health Assessment . The second objective determine concordance SAFE-TBI VA TBI Screen 100 OEF/OIF/OND veteran within Northern New England VA Research Consortium ( Cohort 2 ) . The third objective , carry sample 200 Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) Fort Belvoir Community Hospital OEF/OIF/OND patient ( Cohort 3 ) , determine sensitivity specificity SAFE-TBI use INTRuST study `` Brain Indices Risk Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Mild Traumatic Brain Injury '' initial evaluation `` gold standard '' TBI assessment .</brief_summary>
