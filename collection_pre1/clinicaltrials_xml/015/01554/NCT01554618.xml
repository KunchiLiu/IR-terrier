	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Exenatide Once Weekly Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , double-blind ( controlled assessment period ) , randomize , multicenter , placebo-controlled parallel study design examine efficacy safety EQW compare placebo ( PBO ) adolescents type 2 diabetes 24 week . This study ass safety efficacy EQW ( monotherapy adjunctive therapy oral antidiabetic agent and/or insulin ) . At least 40 % 60 % randomized patient must females . At least 40 % patient recruit area similar ethnicity lifestyle European Union member state . Long term safety efficacy EQW subsequently monitor 28 week open-label , uncontrolled extension period ( Week 52 ) . The study terminate Visit 11 ( Week 62/Study Termination ) follow-up visit occur 10 week last dose administration Visit 10 ( Week 52 ) . This study conduct 77 patient type 2 diabetes treat diet exercise alone combination stable dose oral antidiabetic agent and/or insulin least 2 month prior screen . During controlled assessment period , approximately 77 patient randomly assign 5:2 ratio either EQW 2 mg ( Group A ) PBO ( Group B ) , yield least 70 evaluable patient : least 50 patient exenatide least 20 patient PBO group . Following 24-week controlled assessment period , patient assign EQW 2 mg treatment ( Group A ) continue treat EQW 2 mg extension period ( Week 52 ) . Patients randomized PBO ( Group B ) receive EQW 2 mg begin start extension period , Week 25 Week 52 . In addition receiving study medication , patient participate lifestyle intervention program encompass diet physical activity modification follow signing informed consent assent form ( Visit 1 [ Week -2 ] ) end extension period ( Week 52 ) . Following Visit 11 ( Week 62/Study Termination ) , patient whose height increase least 5 mm Visit 8 ( Week 28 ) Visit 11 ( Week 62/Study Termination ) participate long-term safety follow-up period . Patients discontinue study medication prior Visit 11 ( Week 62/Study Termination ) also participate Extended Safety Follow-up Period , unless height increase le 5 mm 6-month interval study site visit prior discontinuation study medication . Patients height assessment study-site visit 6-month interval prior discontinuation study medication enter Extended Safety Follow-up Period . The Extended Safety Follow Up Period continue 3 year difference two 6-month interval visit le 5 mm increase ( whichever come first ) . No study medication administer Extended Safety Follow-up Period . Blood sample collect calcitonin carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) laboratory measurement .</detailed_description>
