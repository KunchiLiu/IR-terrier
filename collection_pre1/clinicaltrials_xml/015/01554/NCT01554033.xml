	<brief_summary>REGISTRY multi-centre , multi-national , prospective , observational study Huntington 's disease ( HD ) control group volunteer . It open-ended study include many eligible participant willing participate . The goal project collect longitudinal data phenotypical characteristic HD gene mutation carrier regardless whether display clinical symptom sign disease individual part HD family ( irrespective mutation carrier status ) , order : - obtain natural history data wide spectrum HD mutation carrier individual part HD family - relate phenotypical characteristic - genetic factor ( 'genetic modifier ' ) - data derive study body fluid ( blood , urine - 'wet biomarker ' ) - image data ( 'dry biomarker ' ) - expedite identification recruitment participant clinical trial - develop validate sensitive reliable outcome measure detect onset change natural course premanifest manifest HD may also potential outcome measure use future clinical trial clinical care . - plan future research study ( observational interventional trial aim well symptom control aim slow postpone onset progression HD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To collect prospective data phenotypical characteristic HD mutation carrier regardless whether display clinical symptom sign HD individual part HD family ( irrespective mutation carrier status ) , order ; - obtain natural history data wide spectrum HD patient , HD mutation carrier individual part HD family - relate phenotypical characteristic - genetic factor ( 'genetic modifier ' ) , - data derive study body fluid ( blood , urine - 'wet biomarker ' ) - image data ( 'dry biomarker ' ) - expedite identification recruitment participant clinical trial - develop validate sensitive reliable outcome measure detect onset change natural course premanifest manifest HD , may also potential outcome measure use future clinical trial clinical care . - plan future research study ( observational interventional trial aim well symptom control aim slow postpone onset progression HD ) . To achieve objective , participant ask donate biosamples ( blood urine ) study identify genetic modifier HD establish validate biological marker track progressive course HD ; context family history request well order understand relationship clinical data set biosamples related donor . In addition , non-mutation carry family member participant ask consider donate biosamples serve control .</detailed_description>
