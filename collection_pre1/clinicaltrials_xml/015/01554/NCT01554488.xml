	<brief_summary>The Chairman Veterans ' Disability Benefits Commission report recent US Senate hearing asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , sleep apnea among top 13 frequent diagnosis lead disability Department Defense VA system statute . Recent research find sleep apnea common among asthma COPD individual , may cause inhaled corticosteroid use . Many Veterans currently use inhaled corticosteroid , many prescribed medication , give recent inclusion international treatment guideline . As , study address critical need research role potent inhale corticosteroid promote sleep apnea , determinant response , way occur . Results study form foundation future research aim expand understanding effect inhaled corticosteroid upper airway , well develop mean prevent counteract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Fluticasone Effects Upper Airway Patency Obstructive Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Growing data suggest patient obstructive lung disease ( OLD ) asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) increase predisposition obstructive sleep apnea , mechanism ( ) remain unknown . One characteristic patient share use inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) . The investigator recently find dose-dependent relationship ICS use high OSA risk . Furthermore , 16-week observational inhale fluticasone ( FP ) treatment study , investigator observe increased upper airway ( UAW ) collapsibility sleep , measure critical closing pressure ( Pcrit ) , parallel improvement low airway obstruction , large Pcrit deterioration subject sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) baseline . These finding suggest effect ICS `` unify airway '' steroid responsive patient collapsible upper airway baseline . The investigator also find dose-dependent relationship ICS obesity . Based known effect , ICSs could deleteriously affect UAW collapsibility induce dilator ' myopathy fat deposition around UAW . FP potent commonly use ICS . HYPOTHESIS/AIMS : The central hypothesis FP increase UAW collapsibility ( less negative Pcrit ) worsen SDB steroid responsive patient OLD UAWs susceptible collapse baseline , alteration tongue muscle function fat accumulation UAW surround structure . To address hypothesis , investigator propose test effect inhale FP : 1 ) UAW collapsibility sleep SDB severity , assess Pcrit polysomnographic ( PSG ) measure . Exploratory aims test role steroid responsiveness baseline collapsibility determinant FP effect Pcrit SDB ; 2 ) tongue strength fatigability , fat accumulation ( fraction volume , measure MRI ) surround UAW structure . Exploratory aim test whether effect underlie increase UAW collapsibility role steroid responsiveness status mediator FP effect . DESIGN : The investigator propose proof-of-concept mechanistic , randomized-controlled , parallel group study high ( 220 mcg , 4 puff twice day ) vs. low ( 44 mcg twice day ) dose inhaled FP , follow 8-week wash-out period , 58 steroid-naive subject OLD . Following baseline Pcrit , PSG , MRI tongue function ( use Iowa Oral Performance Instrument ) measurement , subject enter 2-week low-dose FP run-in , subsequent randomization either high- vs. low-dose FP , 16 week . At mid-period , Pcrit , tongue function steroid responsiveness status ( define 5 % improvement baseline FEV1 % ) determine . At end treatment , Pcrit , PSG , MRI tongue measurement take . Then , subject enter 8-week wash-out end repeat Pcrit tongue function assessment . SIGNIFICANCE : Millions people , include many Veterans , treat ICS OLD , among COPD , number likely escalate . However , medication alter UAW collapsibility predispose OSA individual , investigator ' preliminary observation suggest ? This research innovative directly evaluate effect ICS UAW structure function sleep wakefulness . At study completion , investigator expectation elucidate effect govern mechanisms ICS UAW patency SDB severity . Data generate form foundation future research aim expand investigator ' understand ICS 's effect UAW mean mitigate/prevent . The clinical implication finding experimental-based verification deleterious effect ICS UAW risk OSA , ultimately enormous financial benefit VA OLD management program .</detailed_description>
