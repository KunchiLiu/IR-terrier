	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disorder characterize motor symptom hypokinesia , rigidity , tremor postural instability . These symptom also present night . Half patient PD difficulty turn around bed . This nocturnal hypokinesia consider possible cause sleep problem population . The diagnosis nocturnal hypokinesia base clinical interview . There need diagnostic device measure nocturnal movement , preferably home setting . This device use diagnostic trajectory well evaluation treatment . Recently Dynaport Minimod ( McRoberts , The Hague ) develop register nocturnal movement . The tri-axial accelerometer develop measure position change night . A validation study actigraphy polysomnography conclude Dynaport MiniMod valid feasible device assess intensity physical activity change body position sleep . Nocturnal hypokinesia treat nocturnal dopamine . Sometimes night-time dose dopaminergics adequate , time slow release dopaminergics need . However response fluctuation negatively influence treatment . In case continuous dopaminergic stimulation need , rotigotine . Rotigotine treat response fluctuation day study show sleep quality measure questionnaire improves . If improvement sleep quality cause improve bed mobility study yet . The study hypothesis rotigotine influence nocturnal hypokinesia PD . Objective study : Primary : â€¢ To study effect rotigotine nocturnal hypokinesia Secondary : - To study possibility measure nocturnal hypokinesia severity home set - To correlate improvement sleep quality rotigotine change nocturnal hypokinesia Study design : We study patient recieve rotigotine part usual care . During three night , nocturnal movement register movement sensor , treatment start well stable medication dose one month . We also assess sleep quality questionnaire . Study population : The study population patient Parkinson 's disease sleep problem cause nocturnal hypokinesia , start treatment rotigotine . Patients recruit neurology patient outdoor clinic Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen . We ask treat neurologist inform u patient start treatment rotigotine . One researcher contact patient give information study . The study first hypothesis generate study start inclusion 10 patient . Intervention ( applicable ) : Primary study parameters/outcome study : Position change night . Secundary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : Objective - Degree mobility , measure speed movement - Total amount movement - Score motor symptom scale accord MDS-UPDRS part III Subjective - Nocturnal sleep quality Excessive daytime sleepiness - Presence nocturnal akinesia</brief_summary>
