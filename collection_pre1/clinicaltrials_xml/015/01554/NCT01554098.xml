	<brief_summary>This study compare two strategy colonoscope withdrawal , use polyp detection primary outcome measure , determine optimal withdrawal strategy . Null Hypothesis : On withdrawal colonoscope , examine patient dynamic position change yield polyp supine position . Alternative Hypothesis : On withdrawal colonoscope , examine patient dynamic position change improve polyp detection compare supine position .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Colonoscopic Withdrawal Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The identification removal polyp show prevent bowel cancer . Although colonoscopy best technique identify polyp , polyp miss even expert hand . Inspection bowel occur predominantly colonoscope withdrawal . Tailoring patient position accord segment bowel examine ( dynamic position change ) technique show improve visualisation bowel wall polyp detection . However , change patient position colonoscope withdrawal widely accept clinical practice . This may lack awareness literature , perception benefit negligible inconvenience change patient position addition small number publication demonstrate beneficial . We plan compare detection polyp colonoscope withdrawal do dynamic position change ( planned series position change optimise mucosal visualisation ) supine position ( lay back ) . These strategy compare perform double colonoscope withdrawalÍ¾ The first withdrawal perform either supine dynamic position . This follow second insertion withdrawal alternative position . The order strategy perform randomised i.e . supine dynamic dynamic supine .</detailed_description>
