	<brief_title>Study Of Single Ascending Doses Of PBL 1427 In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As per randomization schedule , capsule ( ) A B administer subject 240 mL water ambient temperature . Subjects instruct chew crush capsule ( ) consume whole . Compliance dose assess thorough check oral cavity immediately dose . Administration investigational product carry subject sit posture instruct remain seated two hour dose except clinically indicate change posture case natural exigency . Thereafter , subject allow engage normal activity avoid severe physical exertion . The following treatment cohorts follow give : Cohort 1 : A single oral dose 20 mg PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Cohort 2 : A single oral dose 40 mg ( 20 mg X 2 capsule ) PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Cohort 3 : A single oral dose 80 mg ( 20 mg X 4 capsule ) PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Cohort 4 : A single oral dose 150 mg PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Cohort 5 : A single oral dose 300 mg ( 150 mg X 2 capsule ) PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Cohort 6 : A single oral dose 600 mg ( 150 mg X 4 capsule ) PBL 1427 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) Dose level may modify intermediate dose level might test determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) The number cohort , dose level , frequency condition administration subsequent cohort may alter Principal investigator Sponsor evaluation result previous group .</detailed_description>
