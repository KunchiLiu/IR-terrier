	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , combination study drug , capecitabine , radiation cancer . Capecitabine , radiation , study drug kill cancer cell different way . Giving treatment together may make cancer shrink slow growth would get treated capecitabine radiation alone . This Phase I drug study ganetespib give together capecitabine radiation patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Ganetespib experimental drug ; approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The two , capecitabine radiation , approve FDA use rectal cancer . In study , investigator test different dosage `` investigational '' ( experimental ) drug , call ganetespib ( study drug ) . The study drug `` investigational '' approve FDA use . The study drug previously test human . The study use well-established process slowly increase drug dosage determine high dosage give without cause serious side effect . In addition , study help researcher determine side effect drug interaction might . The study also look drug 's pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . PK study drug capecitabine radiation work body ( example long drug last body . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Ganetespib , Capecitabine , Radiation Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients rectal cancer meet eligibility criterion offer enroll study . As part study patient receive standard care capecitabine ( 825 mg/m² mouth twice daily ) radiation . Patients start ganetespib ( STA9090 ) set dose level . The treatment consist two part . In first part patient receive ganetespib full dose twice week vein two week . At end two week , biopsy tumor perform evaluate effect drug tumor . In second phase , patient receive capecitabine , radiation ganetespib specify dose level 5 6 week . After completion phase , patient surgery remove tumor . Each three patient treat specified dose level . Patients monitor least week side effect . If side effect three consecutive patient , investigator treat next three patient higher dose level .</detailed_description>
