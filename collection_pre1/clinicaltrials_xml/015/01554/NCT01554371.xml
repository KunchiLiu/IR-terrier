	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety eribulin ( Halaven™ ) cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan® ) give together different dos . This study look effect , good and/or bad , drug solid tumor . Eribulin drug approve FDA breast cancer spread part body . Cyclophosphamide approve different type cancer ( include breast cancer ) . However , combination eribulin cyclophosphamide consider experimental ; mean combination approve FDA . The funding study provide Eisai Inc. , maker eribulin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Combination With Cyclophosphamide Patients With Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase Ib/II trial design determine MTD DLTs combination eribulin cyclophosphamide solid tumor make preliminary estimate regard efficacy treatment patient advance breast cancer . The study include standard dose-confirmation schema ( phase Ib portion ) enrol 3 6 patients/subjects , solid tumor , per cohort ( 3+3 design ) total 18 patient . The dose-expansion ( phase II portion ) enroll 40 patient advanced breast cancer detect effect size 15 % power 80 % endpoint safety , efficacy , clinical benefit rate . A maximum 58 patient enrolled phase Ib II portion trial combine treated disease progression toxicity mandate treatment change . Eribulin non-taxane microtubule inhibitor FDA approve monotherapy treatment taxane anthracycline resistant metastatic breast cancer . The combination docetaxel cyclophosphamide well-accepted adjuvant chemotherapy regimen become increasingly common therapeutic choice intermediate risk early stage breast cancer . Eribulin favorable toxicity profile compare docetaxel common adverse reaction ( incidence ≤25 % ) include neutropenia , anemia , asthenia/fatigue , alopecia , peripheral neuropathy , nausea , constipation . Eribulin appear activity taxane resistant disease , make attractive partner cyclophosphamide . Neuropathy devastate complication adjuvant chemotherapy metastatic setting , may limit effective therapy reduce quality life . Understanding host factor predict risk neuropathy critical , patient may particular benefit low risk neuropathy associate eribulin therapy . In conjunction trial , include correlative study study propose pharmacogenomic factor associate risk neuropathy . In way potentially able identify patient could preferentially treat less neurotoxic microtubule inhibitor .</detailed_description>
