	<brief_summary>The main purpose research project study seizure-like activity affect blood flow brain patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Changes blood flow change memory think ability , happen Alzheimer 's disease . The investigator use study drug call Levetiracetam , help control seizure-like activity see help change abnormal blood flow brain see people Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects make four separate visit BIDMC . Subject come Clinical Research Center . All visit take around 5 hour apiece . If subject agree study , subject ask read sign consent form . After subject sign consent form , follow thing happen : 1 . Screening Procedures : Screening procedure test procedure do determine subject eligible take part research study . For research study , screen procedure include : - A thorough medical history . Investigators ask subject medical problem . Investigators ask subject Alzheimer 's disease seizures . - A physical examination . Investigators take blood pressure heart rate . They examine heart lung take height weight - Investigators also assess subject 's nervous system . Investigators examine subject 's speech , memory , strength , coordination , reflex . - Investigators ask take paper pencil test . This help u understand memory mood - Subjects blood test check kidney function . Subjects may already test do doctor diagnose Alzheimer 's disease . The information learn help decide whether subject could join study . Investigators explain reason decide subject join study . Our decision NOT mean subject health problem disorder . 2 . Randomization Procedures : Investigators meet one study doctor subject continue study . The study doctor explain subject expect come research center study test take study drug . Subjects come BIDMC Clinical Research Center three visit . These visit occur within one month . All study participant receive study drug three ( 3 ) visit . - Subjects receive levetiracetam , study drug , low dose , 2.5 milligram kilogram body weight , one visit . - Subjects receive levetiracetam , study drug , high dose , 7.5 milligram kilogram body weight , one visit . - Subjects receive placebo one visit . A placebo inactive injection look like study drug , placebo contains active medication . In study , placebo saline ( sterile salt water ) injection . Sometimes study result truly due study medication . Sometimes study result due study medication . Investigators use placebo help u understand reason result study . The order visit study participant . There six different order receive study drug . For example , subject could receive placebo first visit , high dose levetiracetam second visit , low dose levetiracetam third visit . Another example subject could receive low dose first visit , placebo second visit , high dose third visit . Deciding order get study drug do method call `` randomization . '' Randomization mean computer assign patient study drug random manner , like flip coin . Another way say randomization `` chance . '' When flip coin , get head tail chance . The chance get dose study drug placebo equal . After randomization , Subjects assign get one study drug placebo visit . Subjects able choose study drug get visit . Subjects know study drug dose placebo give visit . The study doctor know study drug dose placebo give visit . The study doctor find information quickly emergency . 3 . Research Procedures : Subjects come BIDMC Clinical Research Center three time continue study . A member study team meet subject arrive . Subjects first intravenous catheter ( also call IV ) put vein . A nurse check blood pressure heart rate . Subjects brief physical exam nervous system exam doctor Subjects electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . An EEG give investigator information nervous system - specifically brain . Subjects scalp clean alcohol small disc - call electrode - place scalp use gel . Then head wrap gauze . keep disc move . The disc attach wire EEG machine . The EEG machine bedside give investigator information electrical activity brain . Subjects need lie quietly eye close one hour EEG machine attach . Investigators clean gel hair skin EEG . Investigators give subject either levetiracetam -- study drug -- placebo subject EEG . Investigators give subject study drug placebo intravenous catheter ( `` IV '' ) arm . This take around 20 30 minute . The subject nurse take subject 's blood pressure heart rate two time study drug give subject finish . The subject note side effect time . Subjects review happen MRI scan Investigator . The MRI study conduct Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center Department Radiology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . The MRI method take picture brain blood flow brain , use large magnet radio signal . Subjects ask lie platform slid magnet . An MRI imaging coil , make special wire cover plastic , place around head . Foam pad place around head limit head movement scan . During scan , subject ask lie still back 45 60 minute . They hear loud knock hammer noise MRI take picture , process painless . They give disposable earplug use help lessen noise . During procedure , subject constant contact MRI technician intercom . If time scan feel uncomfortable continue , matter reason , study immediately stop subject remove magnet ( MRI Scanner ) . Subjects return Clinical Research Center MRI . They take pencil-and-paper test one hour . These test tell investigator memory mood . They also learn attention skill . Investigators also learn subjects= language skills `` handedness '' ( tendency favor right leave hand ) . As medication ( levetiracetam ) may make subject drowsy , able drive . Someone need accompany hospital three study visit . The second third study visit sequence event . SUMMARIES Here summary Screening Visit Screening visit / inform consent Review medical history . Brief physical neurological exam . Paper pencil test . Blood drawn check function kidney . Review sign inform consent form . Here summaries three Study Visits Visit One : Vital sign . 2 minute Brief physical neurological exam . 10 minute An intravenous catheter place arm . 5 minute EEG . 60 minute Intravenous dose medication , levetiracetam , placebo . 20 minute MRI scan . 60 minute Paper pencil test . 60 minute Study Visit Two : ( This visit occur one two ( 1-2 ) week Study Visit One ) Vital sign . 2 minute Brief physical neurological exam . 10 minute Intravenous catheter place arm . 5 minute EEG . 60 minute Intravenous dose medication , levetiracetam , placebo . 20 minute MRI scan . 60 minute Paper pencil test . 60 minute Study Visit Three : ( This visit occur one two ( 1-2 ) week Study Visit Two ) Vital sign . 2 minute Physical neurological exam . 10 minute Intravenous catheter place arm . 5 minute EEG . 60 minute Intravenous dose medication , levetiracetam , placebo . 20 minute MRI scan . 60 minute Paper pencil test . 60 minute Each visit take total approximately 5 hour . This include time EEG , MRI image neuropsychological test . Subjects allow time rest activity bed become tired . The CRC staff serve lunch . 4 . Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures . Procedures perform evaluate effectiveness safety research procedures call `` monitoring '' `` follow-up '' procedure . Subject follow-up procedure phone call study doctor one week third visit . They ask side effect study study medication occur Timing : If subject enrol study follow initial screen visit , three study visit separate 2-3 week interval . Therefore , entire study last approximately 6-9 week .</detailed_description>
