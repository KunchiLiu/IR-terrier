	<brief_summary>Tumour angiogenesis identify play critical role tumour growth knowledge lead identification new target cancer therapy . Multiple angiogenic factor involve regulation angiogenesis , among VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) receptor crucial relevance . The inhibition VEGF signal monoclonal antibody small molecule ( kinase inhibitor ) already successfully establish treatment different cancer entity multiple new drug test clinical trial . The ever-expanding list antiangiogenic agent available near future raise question use agent sequence . As consequence biomarkers go indispensible tool choose effective drug predict dose resistance . The present project base academic clinical trial patient suffer different cancer type ( colorectal cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , renal cell cancer hepatocellular cancer ) treat routinely antiangiogenic agent include . Consecutive serum blood probe take examined correlated functional image clinical course . The following parameter select : soluble marker plasma ( VEGF , bFGF , ICAM , sVGFR-2 IL-8 , SDF1 Dickkopf 3 ) cellular parameter like circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( CEPs ) . In conclusion , present project screen potential biomarkers biomarker combination relevant antiangiogenic drug different tumour type . The predictive value profile evaluate large cohort . In future profile could possibly help clinician use agent effectively therefore also economically .</brief_summary>
