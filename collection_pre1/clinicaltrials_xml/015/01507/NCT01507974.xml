	<brief_title>Examination Efficacy Preventive Antibiotic Treatment During Puerperium Among Pregnant Women With Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pregnancy functional modification urinary tract influence function urinary tract system . Those change raise risk urinary tract infection . The common bacterial infection pregnancy urinary tract infection . Actually , asymptomatic bacteriuria common infection 8 % population . Symptomatic infection may cause cystitis include renal calyx parenchyma cause pyelonephritis . There common protocol bacteriuria treatment . The recurrence rate treatment 30 % . Preventive treatment nitrofurantoin demonstrate effective , although small risk acute respiratory distress resolve cessation treatment . Renal infection common serious infection pregnancy . Complication renal infection lead ARDS urosepsis . Renal infection usually develop second trimester relate prim parity young woman . About 20 % woman deteriorate renal insufficiency . 30-40 % case follow recurrent bacteriuria later , reason , preventive treatment recommend delivery . In previous study preventive treatment reduce bacteriuria rate 38 % 8 % . After delivery , morphological change include edema , bladder hyperemia raise urinary volume , pass away 3 month post partum . There slight information regard rate bacteriuria puerperium , information relate early puerperium period . In addition , consequence infection unknown . The aim study estimate efficacy preventive antibiotic treatment puerperium . Objectives 1 . To estimate rate bacteriuria urinary tract infection puerperium among woman preventive treatment pregnancy 2 . To evaluate efficacy preventive treatment puerperium Hypothesis : The pregnancy modification cause urinary tract infection pregnancy , exist also puerperium , cause complication Study design Prospective , randomize , open label Study population : Pregnant woman two episode bacteriuria one episode pyelonephritis , treat prophylactic antibiotic Study period From 6 week delivery The study size determine accord reduction bacteriuria rate follow preventive treatment 38 % 8 % . Basing fact , group include 37 woman , get 80 % power Î±=0.05 . Study protocol : woman randomize recruitment . Demographic obstetrical data collect . The woman treatment group continue prophylactic treatment delivery , 6 week . If woman breastfeeds , treatment fit situation . Urine culture collect morning follow delivery , 3 6 week post delivery . The woman invite high risk unit follow 3 6 week . Details regard bacteriuria , urinary tract infection , pyelonephritis admission related complication collect . The study approve local Helsinki committee . Time table Duration : one year</detailed_description>
