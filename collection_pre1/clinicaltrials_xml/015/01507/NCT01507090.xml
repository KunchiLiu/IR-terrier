	<detailed_description>In 'real-world ' health care setting exist number circumstance weight child desirable even necessary unavailable . The conspicuous setting find develop country many medical clinic lack suitable scale obtain accurate infant child weight . Though resource restriction less issue develop country , scenario still exist weight assessment problematic . For example , accurate estimate child 's weight rarely available emergency trauma situation , in-patient setting ( e.g . critical care unit , orthopedic clinic ) obtain accurate patient weight impair presence external hose , tube , cast , and/or medical equipment . Irrespective environment , challenge setting present ; namely , provision age-appropriate , weight-based intervention remain accurate approach deliver therapy child . Thus , technique permit accurate weight estimation address critical medical need develop developed country . Numerous weight estimation strategy describe used varying degree clinical practice . Many publish technique distinct advantage . For example ; simple age-based equation use without need reference material , strategy utilize preprinted table tool limit risk calculation error . Other technique present unnecessary complexity end-user include ; need subjective assessment habitus , requirement solve exponential equation , call multiple formula delineate age bracket , reliance one reference chart . Irrespective simplicity complexity , almost report technique significant limitation . Relatively method evaluate pediatric population vary race , ethnicity nationality essentially single previously describe method provide accurate estimate weight across broad age- weight-bands . Apart parental recall vary accuracy , commonly use strategy estimate weight rely child 's age , length , combination two parameter . While simple easy integrate weight estimation technique , age base strategy fail account extreme body composition stature observe child age . Similarly , length base strategy take consideration two child height may demonstrate markedly discrepant weight base underlying nutritional status ( e.g . malnourish , underweight , overweight , obese ) . Consequently , many currently available weight estimation strategy perform well small subset child . As , remain critical need weight estimation method accurate across wide range pediatric age , weight , length , nationality body composition despite relative abundance strategy already exist . Investigators Children 's Mercy Hospitals Clinics recently develop validated weight estimation method ( Mercy MethodTM ) address principal limitation previously publish method , require subjective assessment performs robustly independently age length broad range weight . As strategy , Mercy Method incorporate growth velocity use humeral length surrogate total body length . Total body length discrepant depend whether measurement obtain child stand lie difficult obtain child uncooperative obtund . The Mercy Method also incorporate body habitus quantitative variable improves accuracy overall length-based weight estimate remove subjective nature categorize child 's body type one alternative ( e.g . `` slim , '' `` average , '' `` heavy '' ) . By develop model consideration mind able expand age range weight estimation method apply remove length restriction typically impose disproportionate increase weight-for-height observe child get old . In brief , demographic anthropometric data child 2 month 16 year age extract NHANES database individual datasets randomly assign method development ( n=17,328 ) method validation ( n=1,938 ) set . Humeral length ( HL ) mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) use develop weight estimation method 1 ) collapse length habitus measurement discrete bin , 2 ) examine median population weight bin-pair , 3 ) statistically weight bin-pairs age sample size , 4 ) calculate fractional weight HL MUAC . An individual weight estimate generate simple addition MUAC HL fractional bin value correspond individual child 's measurement . The predictive performance method evaluate use internal validation set compare performance 13 previously publish weight estimation method apply data . The Mercy Method outperform 13 publish method evaluate goodness-of-fit , mean error , mean percentage error , root mean square error percentage child agreement within 10 % actual weight . Most age-and length-based strategy examine overestimated weight child classify , BMI , underweight significantly underestimated weight child classify overweight obese . The degree occur depend largely constant drive mathematical equation , method bias toward accurate prediction child low weight ( e.g . Broselow ) others perform well among child high weight bracket ( e.g . Theron ) . Irrespective directionality , bias observe method extremes weight represent much 3-fold error predict actual weight . Discrepancies magnitude dangerous , potentially life-threatening , depend 'forgiving ' intervention treatment administer . The singular habitus-based method ( i.e . Cattermole ) rank among best ( Mercy Method ) respect absolute bias ; however , perform moderately well precision MPE factor assessment . This method , develop Chinese child consistently overestimate weight lower absolute weight underestimate weight high absolute weight irrespective BMI percentile . This suggest relationship weight MUAC tend linear within give population , mathematical constant define relationship differ population different height-for-weight average . Given nature data use develop validate Mercy Method , comparative performance Devised Weight Estimation Method ( DWEM , method incorporate body length body habitus ) could assess . Notably , DWEM involve subjective rating `` slim , '' `` average , '' `` heavy '' . While DWEM show outperform age-based method , categorical assignment habitus couple inconsistency subjective assessment within observer [ inter-rater agreement- 78 % ( range : 58-93 % ) ; intra-rater agreement- 86 % ( range : 81-94 % ) ] contribute bias precision estimate large observe strategy base solely length . While Mercy Method use reference table , practical application development simple inexpensive device perform two require measurement simultaneously report predict weight directly device oppose consult separate table chart . Consequently , 3D Mercy TAPE develop perform measurement simultaneously require external reference arrive weight estimate give child . An alternative 2D Mercy TAPE also design . It require two serial measurement simple addition use 3D TAPE require fold manipulation remove packaging . Both device intend print flexible , non-stretchable medium ( e.g . paper , plastic coat paper , fiberglass ) disposable semi-permanent , inexpensive mass produce easy store . In numeric form , Mercy TAPE would expect limited utility setting care provider illiterate use write language . However , tool easily revise color and/or symbol whose combination would correspond give dose , intervention strategy weight target . While Mercy Method expect perform well U.S. child give creation use data U.S. database , external validation non-U.S. setting currently ongoing support World Health Organization gauge utility child vary ethnicity geographic origin . The related 2D 3D Mercy TAPE still await prospective evaluation . The requisite study satisfy validation requirement describe herein hypothesis : The Mercy TAPE demonstrate predictive performance Mercy method independent pediatric assessment .</detailed_description>
