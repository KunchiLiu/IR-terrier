	<detailed_description>This phase I , double-blind , individually-randomized ( 1:1 , vaccine : placebo ) , control trial two group , IVACFLU ( A/H1N1 ) placebo . Healthy male female adult 18 40 year age invite participate . In addition sponsor monitoring safety , Program Appropriate Technology Health ( PATH ) review safety data . Safety data 7 day post-dose one subject review blinded fashion prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo . PATH review adverse event ( AEs ) , include clinical laboratory evaluation ( pre- post-vaccination ) advise volunteer may receive dose two study vaccine placebo . For subject , procedure timeline summarize . On day first screen ( S1 ) , 14 day ( 5 30 day ) prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo , subject screen eligibility medical history review , physical examination , test serologic evidence chronic viral infection [ human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) ] , routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick . For screen serologic evidence chronic viral infection , appropriate pre- post-test counseling must provide . Subject screen eligibility continue complete second screening day ( S2 ) . This second screening day occur day schedule enrollment trial administration study vaccine placebo ( Day 0 ) . Women undergo pregnancy test use urine sample Day 0 . Fully eligible subject enrol trial . At time , blood specimen collect immunological test prior administration study vaccine placebo . Subjects unaware allocation , IVACFLU placebo , receive ; study vaccine placebo mask . Subjects carefully monitor adverse reaction 60 minute vaccination . During first week follow vaccination , subject ask record local general sign symptom use preprinted diary card , thermometer , small ruler . Concomitant medication also record . In addition solicit sign , subject ask report adverse event , whether believe event relate vaccination . Member investigator 's clinical team visit subject one five day vaccination check subject correctly complete diary card check subject ' well-being . Subjects return study clinic 7 day dose one . At time , investigator check subject ' diary card transcribe adverse event onto case report form use medical language . Blood urine specimen also collect routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick . Two day subject schedule receive dose two , subject visit call remind next visit study clinic check subject ' well-being . Subjects return study clinic 3 week administration dose one study vaccine placebo order receive dose two . At time , interim history concomitant medication review . Women undergo urine pregnancy test . All subject undergo collection blood urine specimens routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick collection blood serum specimens immunologic analysis . Then subject receive dose two study vaccine placebo monitor 60 minute . After receipt dose two , subject complete diary card 7 day vaccination visit member investigator 's clinical team day one five vaccination check subject correctly complete diary card check subject ' well-being . Subjects return study clinic 7 day dose two ( Day 28 ) review diary card investigator collection blood urine specimens routine biochemical hematological blood test urinalysis dipstick . Two day subject ' next schedule visit 3 week administration dose two , subject visit call remind next visit study clinic check subject ' well-being . Subjects return study clinic 3 week administration dose two ( Day 42 ) study vaccine placebo another study visit . At time , interim history concomitant medication review final blood specimen collect immunogenicity analysis . Women also undergo final pregnancy screen . Subjects ask immediately report severe adverse event ( SAEs ) occur Day 42 Day 201 ( approximately 6 month receipt dose two ) . To facilitate reporting , member investigator 's team visit call subject monthly check well-being . At last study visit Day 201 , subject interview examine one last time complete study . For evaluation serum antibody ( HAI microneutralization ) , serum specimen collect Day 0 ( prior administration dose one study vaccine placebo ) , Day 21 ( prior administration dose two study vaccine placebo ) Day 42 .</detailed_description>
