	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether tumor dose escalate improve freedom local-regional progression-free ( LRPF ) rate 2 year individualized adaptive radiation treatment ( RT ) plan apply use fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan acquire course fractionate RT patient inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project [ NSABP ] , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [ RTOG ] , Gynecologic Oncology Group [ GOG ] [ NRG ] Oncology ) II . To determine whether relative change standard uptake value ( SUV ) peak baseline during-treatment FDG-PET/CT , define ( during-treatment SUVpeak - baseline SUVpeak ) /baseline SUV peak x 100 % , predict LRPF rate 2-year follow . ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] -American College Radiology Imaging Network [ ACRIN ] ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether individualized dose escalation improve overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , lung cancer cause-specific survival , delays time local-regional progression compare conventional RT plan . ( NRG Oncology ) II . To compare rate severe ( grade 3+ Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] , v. 4 ) radiation-induced lung toxicity ( RILT ) define severe RILT pneumonitis clinical fibrosis . ( NRG Oncology ) III . To compare severe adverse event , include grade 3+ ( CTCAE , v. 4 ) esophagitis grade 2 pericardial effusion , grade cardiac adverse event related chemoradiation PET/CT-guided adaptive approach conventional RT plan . ( NRG Oncology ) IV . To evaluate association baseline 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) , PET/CT image agent uptake ( tumor-to-blood pool ratio ) LRPF ( i.e. , assessment use baseline FMISO-PET uptake prognostic marker ) . ( ECOG-ACRIN ) V. To determine relative change SUVpeak baseline during-treatment FDG-PET/CT and/or baseline FMISO uptake ( tumor-to-blood pool ratio ) predict differential benefit adaptive therapy , i.e. , association uptake parameter LRPF rate depend assign treatment thus , assess uptake parameter useful guide therapy , i.e. , predictive marker . ( ECOG-ACRIN ) VI . To determine PET-imaging uptake parameter ( SUV peak during-treatment FDG-PET , maximum SUV , relative change maximum SUVs pre- during-treatment FDG-PET/CT , change metabolic tumor volume , FMISO total hypoxic volume , FMISO tumor mediastinum ratio , EORTC University Michigan/Kong 's response criterion ) predict OS , LRPF rate , lung cancer cause-specific ( LCS ) survival well explore optimal threshold differentiate responder non-responders . ( ECOG-ACRIN ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study whether model combine current clinical and/or image factor blood marker , include osteopontin ( OPN ) [ hypoxia marker ] , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) cytokeratin fragment ( CYFRA ) 21-1 ( tumor burden ) , interleukin ( IL ) -6 ( inflammation ) predict 2-year LRPF rate survival well current model use clinical factor radiation dose well image factor . II . To determine/validate whether model combine mean lung dose ( MLD ) , transform growth factor beta1 ( TGF beta1 ) IL-8 improve predictive accuracy clinical significant RILT well compare current model use MLD alone . III . To explore , preliminary manner , whether proteomic genomic marker blood prior early course treatment associate tumor response completion treatment , LRPF rate , PFS , OS , pattern failure treatment-related adverse event , radiation pneumonitis , esophagitis , pericardial effusion . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : Prior treatment , patient undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan baseline periodically study . A subset patient also undergo 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET/CT scan baseline . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : ARM I ( standard chemoradiotherapy ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week 30 fraction . Patients also receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute weekly 6 week . Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT imaging fraction 18 19 . ARM II ( experimental chemoradiotherapy ) : Patients undergo individualize dose image-guided radiotherapy QD 5 day week 30 fraction undergo 18 F FDG-PET/CT fraction 18 19 . Based scan result , patient undergo individualized adaptive radiotherapy final 9 fraction . Patients also receive paclitaxel carboplatin Arm I . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Beginning 4-6 week chemoradiotherapy , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
