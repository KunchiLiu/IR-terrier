	<detailed_description>Background Limb apraxia define inability correctly perform skilled and/or learn limb movement , explain elementary motor sensory deficit cognitive problem . It impair real object/tool use well pantomime imitation gesture affect side body major source disability independent neurological deficit . It significantly affect activity daily live ( ADL ) associate poor outcome independent live return work . Apraxia largely base leave parieto-frontal damage due focal injury widespread neurodegeneration cortical area and/or connection . However , apraxia describe damage right hemisphere , although less frequent severe . Apraxia increasingly recognize clinical problem restorative neurology various approach describe treat disorder . Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system lead cause disability young adult . It characterize focal demyelination well axonal damage . MS classically think typical white matter disorder . However , early pathology study recent magnetic resonance tomography ( MRI ) study show demyelination cortex deep gray matter nucleus . Grey matter damage start early disease substantially affect cognitive functioning . Apraxia impair manual dexterity common problem MS lead impaired activity daily live . However , specific train program improve apraxia manual dexterity MS lacking . In study , want evaluate impact target occupational therapy program apraxia manual dexterity patient MS dexterity problem . It rater-blind , randomize , control trial . Patients routinely see MS consult hour , fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion willing participate study evaluate Apraxia use AST ( Apraxia Screen TULIA ) . In case Apraxia patient randomize 1:1 use seal envelope receive occupational home therapy ( experimental group ) general physical exercise ( control group ) 4 week ( 4 time 5 day row ) . At study entry study end 4 week , apraxia test patient use extended version AST , TULIA . Furthermore , questionnaire `` activity daily live '' `` quality life '' evaluate , test regard cognition , spasticity , ataxia , fatigue well EDSS perform . Objective To evaluate impact target occupational therapy program apraxia manual dexterity patient MS. Methods see .</detailed_description>
