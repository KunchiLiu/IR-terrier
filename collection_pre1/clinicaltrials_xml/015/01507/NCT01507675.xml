	<detailed_description>Suicide significant problem among Veterans U.S. Military . Katz ( 2007 ) report 144 suicide among Veterans serve Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) 2002-2005 . There nationwide surveillance system track Veteran suicide . However , National Violent Death Reporting System ( NVDRS ) create 2003 Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) purpose gather thorough information suicide violent death allow researcher reasonably extrapolate national suicide rate Veterans . A CDC report ( 2006 ) base NVDRS data estimate approximately 6,500 veteran war die suicide year , account approximately 20 % suicide per year nationwide . While much know risk factor suicide ( e.g. , Beck , Steer , Kovacs , &amp; Garrison , 1985 ; Jobes &amp; Mann , 1999 ) information little clinical utility predict whether individual likely die suicide near-term . One attempt address issue interpersonal-psychological theory suicide ( Joiner , 2005 ) . The interpersonal psychological theory propose people die suicide three reason : ( 1 ) perceive burden others ; ( 2 ) experience profound feel disconnectedness others , Joiner ( 2005 ) call `` thwarted belongingness '' ( p. 118 ) ; ( 3 ) become habituate fear physical pain inherent suicidal act repeatedly endure painful provocative situation , whether experience repeat suicide attempt , physically painful experience , frequent exposure danger . Importantly , three factor must present suicide occur , accord interpersonal-psychological theory ; together , three characteristic `` proximal , causal , interactive risk factor '' ( Van Orden , Witte , Gordon et al. , 2008a , p. 72 ) . Components theory test adult ( Joiner , Pettit , Walker , Voelz , Cruz , &amp; Rudd , 2002 ; Joiner &amp; Rudd , 2000 ) , college student , adolescent ( Joiner , Rudd , Rouleau , &amp; Wagner , 2000 ) . However , research begin explore whether theory applies Veterans ( Cornette , Deboard , Clark , Holloway , Brenner , Gutierrez , et al. , 2007 ; Cornette , deRoon-Cassini , Joiner , &amp; Proescher , 2006 ) . Brenner et al . ( 2008 ) conduct qualitative study OEF/OIF Veterans find relevance theory experience . In particular , theme emerge around combat context exposure painful stimulus , perception burdensomeness , fail belongingness . This theory show promise design prevention clinical intervention strategy Veterans , data need base work . To facilitate test interpersonal-psychological theory suicide , Joiner colleague develop several instrument ( Bender , Gordon , &amp; Joiner , 2007 ; Bryan , Morrow , Anestis , &amp; Joiner , 2010 ; Van Orden , Witte , Gordon et al. , 2008a ) . The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire ( INQ ) tap construct thwart belongingness perceive burdensomeness . The Acquired Capability Suicide Scale ( ACSS ; Van Orden et al. , 2008 ) measure fearlessness suicide . The current study focus 12-item version INQ ( INQ-12 ; Van Orden , Witte , Gordon , Bender , &amp; Joiner , 2008a ) recently validate Freedenthal , Lamis , Osman , Kahlo , Gutierrez ( 2011 ) . This measure contain seven item assess perceive burdensomeness five item assess belongingness . An example burdensomeness item INQ-12 , `` These day , I think I fail people life '' . An example belongingness item , `` These day , people care '' . The ACSS 20-item measure rat scale 1 ( like ) 5 ( much like ) . Sample item include , `` I afraid die '' `` I tolerate lot pain people '' . Van Orden et al . report acceptable convergent discriminant validity . The author also report strong negative correlation fear suicide subscale Reasons Living Inventory ( RFL ; Linehan , Nielsen , &amp; Chiles , 1983 ) positive correlation courage kill oneself item Beck Scale Suicide Ideation ( BSS ; Beck &amp; Steer , 1991 ) . Bender , Gordon , Bresin , Joiner ( 2011 ) report acceptable internal consistency well . However , formal psychometric study ACSS yet conduct . Joiner ( 2005 ) describe burdensomeness , fail belongingness acquire capability separate construct , INQ-12 ACSS design assess independently . However , purpose explain whether give individual likely die suicide , Joiner et al . ( 2009 ) explain first two construct together create desire death third necessary person engage potentially lethal self-harm behavior . Therefore , complex interaction three propose . Support interaction find Joiner et al . two independent sample , one community sample young adult second draw archival data active duty military personnel treat recent significant suicide-related event ( e.g. , serious ideation attempt ) . A major limitation study measure construct differ , make somewhat difficult determine assess two sample . Additionally , psychometric examination INQ-12 Freedenthal colleague ( 2011 ) find evidence overarch factor unite two subscales burdensomeness fail belongingness . Assessing suicide risk key element clinical management high-risk individual ( Gutierrez et al. , 2009 ) , first step . To adequately select appropriate intervention clinician must know drive individual 's suicidality ( Jobes , 2006 ) also factor keep person act thought urge . This information well help clinician client develop strategy aim create ( rediscover ) make life worth living ; focus plan , goal , hope future ( Jobes , Comtois , Brenner , &amp; Gutierrez , 2011 ) . Historically , RFL ( Linehan et al. , 1983 ) one primary measure protective factor suicide , indeed show great utility . A potentially related area study role one 's value . The consciously chosen way individual live life , drive force behind action , desire outcomes behavior define individual value ( Luoma , Hayes , &amp; Walser , 2007 ) . Helping client live life consistent value provide purpose meaning , give direction choice , allow set reasonable , flexible goal likely motivate meaningful action ( Luoma et al. ) . Accomplishing thing greatly facilitate reduce individual 's risk suicide , since answer fundamental existential question `` life worth live ? '' Ciarrochi Bailey ( 2008 ) create Survey Life Principles ass value , provide preliminary support use manual .</detailed_description>
