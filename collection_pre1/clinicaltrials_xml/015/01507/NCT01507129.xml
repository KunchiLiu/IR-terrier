	<brief_summary>Low level dehydration ( loss body water correspond 2 % body weight ) , deteriorate physical cognitive performance may also link number chronic disease . The standard test use assessment hydration status plasma osmolality . This blood test invasive , require time laboratory equipment accurate isotonic dehydration . The goal project determine whether new molecular technology , saliva-based Stress Response Profiling ( SRP ) biomarkers , could use non-invasive diagnostics dehydration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dehydration , loss body water , common health problem military operation , athletic event illness , particularly child elderly . Warfighters frequently become dehydrated training fight hot mountainous environment heat high altitude increase body water loss . The negative consequence dehydration worsen body water loss increase . Severe dehydration ( &gt; 10 % ) life-threatening emergency may result heat illness , seizure , permanent brain damage death . The common type dehydration cause sweat loss heavy physical labor exercise ( hypertonic dehydration ) . A different type dehydration cause blood loss , burn , diarrhea , vomit diuretic drug use example diabetic ( isotonic dehydration ) . Despite critical importance proper fluid balance human performance health , field-expedient , non-invasive dehydration test available either form dehydration . The ultimate goal project develop field-expedient , non-invasive test type dehydration . The test sensitive 2 % dehydration , critical threshold performance impairment statistically valid decision point hydration assessment . Design : Fifteen volunteer first euhydrated ( well-hydrated ) moderately dehydrate ( 2-4 % ) use two procedure . First , sweat loss exercise heat without fluid ( hypertonic dehydration ) . Second , excessive urination stimulate diuretic pill call Lasix ( isotonic dehydration ) . SRP biomarkers saliva sample compare change body weight , know hydration indicator blood urine . Results identify best SRP biomarkers diagnose type dehydration compare accuracy new saliva test exist hydration indicator .</detailed_description>
