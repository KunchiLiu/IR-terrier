	<brief_summary>Current human IVF technology employ two strategy respective culture medium embryo development ; 'let embryo choose ' ( utilizes single step medium ) 'back-to-nature ' ( utilizes sequential medium ) . To knowledge , sibling oocyte study evaluate potential advantages/disadvantages strategies one another .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time-lapse Evaluation Human Embryo Development Single Versus Sequential Culture Media - Sibling Oocyte Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maintaining optimal embryo development vitro culture key element assist reproduction treatment . Whether concept mimic vivo environment 'must ' order compromise outcome matter debate since 'let embryo choose ' strategy show perform least good 'back nature ' several study . 'Let embryo choose '' approach utilizes milieu relatively constant concentration ingredient ( single culture system ) compare latter , demand embryos support accord passage Fallopian tube uterus sequential culture medium . Basic difference ingredient ; presence ( 1 ) glucose instead pyruvate , ( 2 ) essential aminoacids early embryo stage ( day 3 ) single step medium , ( 3 ) presence EDTA sequential medium . Vast majority result obtain study patient randomize group instead employ sibling ( oocyte/embryo ) model could enable patient serve control . In fact , claim introduce sibling oocyte study design could give methodological problem time fertilization since different type culture medium vary osmolarity . Likewise study employ sibling oocyte model utilized two different medium ( home-made versus G1.2/G1.2 ) although osmolarity former adjust 280-285 mOsm ) . This study report significant difference day3/5 embryo development well pregnancy/implantation rate group . Subsequent study , however , favour single step medium , find high proportion compact embryos zygote day3 , morula 4 , high blastocyst yield , overall high utilization rate day5 improve implantation rate compare sequential medium . Yet , besides potential variation gamete quality patient allocate group ( describe ) , differences static observation time embryos laboratory could affect result study . Current introduction time-lapse equipment human assist reproduction technology enable distinct definition embryo development possible quantify pace embryo cleavage various medium . Such definition also useful determine predictive value embryo development pre-defined time point applicable embryology laboratory use various culture system .</detailed_description>

Cycles oocytes/embryos subject biopsy also exclude due potential risk delay embryo development case ( Kirkegaard et al. , 2011 ) . Furthermore , cycle diagnosis infertility endometrial factor include since aetiology could negatively affect implantation despite good embryo development .</criteria>
