	<brief_summary>There grow evidence patient undergo bone mineral density testing ( BMD ) often take important step improve bone health . The investigator conduct randomized-controlled trial evaluate impact novel practical patient activation intervention ( mail patient bone density test result ) quality bone-related healthcare cost-effectiveness BMD testing . Equally important , investigator intervention could easily modify include patient population chronic disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Activation After DXA Result Notification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone mineral density ( BMD ) peak early adulthood decline progressively age . As BMD decline normal , low ( formerly call osteopenia ) , osteoporosis , risk fracture progressively increase . In effort prevent bone loss reduce fracture risk , widely accept guideline include U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Surgeon General 's Office recommend BMD screen old adult use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . The rationale screening patient provider use DXA result `` cue action '' take necessary step enhance bone health lifestyle modification ( e.g. , weight bearing exercise ) , Calcium/Vitamin D supplementation , pharmacotherapy indicate . However , multiple study demonstrate patient provider often fail take recommended action follow DXA test , thus defeat much purpose screen . Over past five year systematically develop pilot test low-cost practical patient activation intervention base upon Health Belief Model . The intervention consist DXA scan center mail patient customized letter contain result DXA scan plus educational information osteoporosis , supplement follow-up phone call nurse educator . Preliminary study demonstrate intervention well receive patient provider enhances bone-related quality care . The overarch objective current proposal rigorously examine impact patient activation intervention bone-related quality care adult undergo screen DXA scan randomized-controlled trial conduct three study site . In addition , examine real-world cost associate intervention impact intervention overall cost-effectiveness BMD screening . We hypothesize activation intervention increase optimization Calcium/Vitamin D intake , enhance use pharmacotherapy indicate , improve patient satisfaction bone-related healthcare , improve patient ' osteoporosis specific knowledge compare usual care</detailed_description>
