	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia one ot frequently see long term complication abdominal surgery . Despite study optimal suture technique laparotomy , risk incisional hernia midline incision remain 5-20 % . One major risk factor incisional hernia median laparotomy obesity . The closure technique midline incision remain unchanged since many decade primarily consist suture linea alba . Interest prevention incisional hernia aid synthetic mesh grow one large randomize trial active recruiting patient Germany , Netherlands Belgium ( Prima Trial ) . Patients BMI 27 high risk develop incisional hernia midline incision incidence 22 % 12 month . This high risk group patient may benefit prevention . Some small study perform evaluate usefulness safety primary laparotomy wound closure aid prosthetic mesh . These study show low risk incisional hernia low infection rate , even use contaminate wound colostomy surgery . The goal study evaluate effectiveness incisional hernia prevention elective median laparotomy patient BMI 27 . A randomized control trial perform compare commonly use technique run suture close aid prosthetic onlay mesh . The primary outcome measure incisional hernia occurrence . Secondary outcome measure complication , surgical site infection , post-operative pain quality life .</brief_summary>
