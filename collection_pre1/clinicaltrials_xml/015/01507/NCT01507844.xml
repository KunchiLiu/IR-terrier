	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease disease characterize small airway inflammation obstruction . The small airway disease produce hyperinflation ( air trap ) , increase exercise . Continuous positive airway pressure may reduce small airway obstruction therefore air trap . Pulmonary function test include lung volume rest exercise measure . In addition , exercise endurance time treatment treatment measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Effect Air Trapping Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous positive airway pressure prevent small air way collapse may also clear secretion . At first stage optimal pressure reduce air trap determine . In addition , patient undergo maximal exercise test . A baseline complete pulmonary function test perform follow continuous positive air way pressure pre-determined pressure . This follow exercise 60 % maximal obtain previously .</detailed_description>
