	<brief_title>Ketamine For Suicidal Ideation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression debilitate disorder affect 12-20 % population among top five leading cause burden disease worldwide ( Kruijshaar ME 2005 ) . Suicide associate depression psychiatric disorder pervasive public health problem result almost one million death per year . Unfortunately , current treatment severe depression limit efficacy suicidality , specifically due slow time course change suicidal thought . Recently ketamine , glutamate-modulating agent , show antidepressant anti-suicidal effect outpatient depress patient . The propose study test ability single sub-anesthetic intravenous ( IV ) dose glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist , ketamine , provide rapid decrease suicidal ideation ( SI ) patient hospitalize SI . In randomized parallel-arm placebo control trial , ketamine compare midazolam , expect mimic acute subjective effect ketamine sustain antidepressant effect . Specific Aim 1 : To determine feasibility tolerability single low-dose IV infusion ketamine patient prominent SI elevate risk suicide . Hypothesis 1 : Ketamine administration feasible well tolerated patient admit psychiatric hospital SI . Specific Aim 2 : To test efficacy single IV dose ketamine , compare anesthetic control condition ( midazolam ) , rapidly reduce SI control hospital setting . Hypothesis 2 : Ketamine associate significant rapid reduction SI depressive symptom within 24 hour . This study test rapid anti-suicidal effect single IV dose N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine suicidality compare clinical response single IV dose short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam . Midazolam able induce transient neuropsychiatric effect mimic ketamine therefore expect protect integrity blind . Participants continue receive standard treatment psychiatric condition throughout trial . This unique `` proof-of-concept '' study suicidal patient conduct three-year period .</detailed_description>
