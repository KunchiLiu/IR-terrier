	<brief_summary>This observational study , aim compare outcomes ambulatory gastrointestinal investigation physical activity use accelerometry . An ambulatory study refers one patient monitor freely , often outside hospital environment . For investigator use lightweight ( 7.4g ) tri-axial accelerometer wear behind ear . For capsule endoscopy , investigator interested physical activity affect speed capsule transit GI tract . Capsule endoscopy involve patient swallow pill contain camera , order image part bowel conventional endoscope reach . A rapid transit may result insufficient mucosal visualisation , would reduce sensitivity investigation . For oesophageal pH monitoring , essential patient behaves would normally produce measurement represent standard day . Using accelerometry , investigator compare amount , nature , physical activity take throughout investigation precede day , week . In addition , analysis motion data capture allow u correlate specific activity body orientation pH reading get good insight pathophysiology patient 's condition . The study conduct 6-9 month Imperial College Trust 's medical outpatient service . All patient undergoing capsule endoscopy ambulatory oesophageal monitoring ask consider participate . Patients receive eAR sensor 2 day investigation , ask wear end investigation ( whilst sleep ) . Capsule endoscopy normally take less 12 hour , pH monitoring take 24 48 hour . Participation make difference standard type care receive , sensor data additional . Hypothesis 1 There change amount nature physical activity take patient ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring capsule endoscopy . Hypothesis 2 There correlation physical activity level speed gastrointestinal transit .</brief_summary>
