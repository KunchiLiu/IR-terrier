	<brief_summary>Polyphenols , compound find high level berry fruit , show health promote benefit various mechanism vivo vitro . These benefit include antioxidant activity , anti-inflammatory property , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibition . This study aim expand extremely promising animal data literature , pilot study result , investigate whether drink contain berry fruit improve cognitive performance mood healthy human participant . Our central hypothesis fruit extract reduce breakdown neurotransmitter dopamine serotonin . This reduction breakdown could therefore increase level neurotransmitter convey benefit regard mood cognitive function . The investigator assess pharmacokinetic activity berry fruit extract MAO activity test hypothesis . A second hypothesis berryfruit polyphenols may alter circulate level glucose may turn affect cognitive performance mood . A prior study carry Plant &amp; Food Research collaboration University Northumbria , UK , find promising result acutely supplement participant berry fruit base drink . This study aim use result previous study ass depth effect berry fruit drink human behaviour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project investigate acute effect human cognitive behaviour mood single consumption 2 berryfruit drink ( balance polyphenol content ) versus placebo . Drinks match taste , sugar content appearance . Drinks contain natural berry fruit grown juiced extracted New Zealand food-safe condition . The study follow double-blind , counterbalance , placebo control , repeat measure design 36 healthy participant age 18 30 complete 3 study day session well one training/screening visit ( four visit total ) . On one occasion participant receive placebo , another berryfruit drink 1 , another berryfruit drink 2 . Study day space one week apart accommodate wash period . Both berryfruit drink make include 500mg polyphenols/60kg body weight . Sucralose ( artificial sweetener ) add make drink palatable . Participants screen intolerance allergy drink training/screening session . Psychometric task mood scale measure use Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System ( COMPASS ) , purpose design software application flexible delivery randomly generate parallel version standard novel cognitive assessment task previously show sensitive nutritional intervention use prior study conduct Northumbria University . The cognitive assessment battery include : Bond-Lader mood scale , visual analogue mood scale , 7 repetition Digital Vigilance , Stroop , Rapid Visual Information Processing Mental Fatigue Visual Analogue scale . This follow logical reasoning task final set Bond-Lader mood scale . Baseline cognitive test involve one repetition cognitive assessment battery ( Bond-Lader mood scale , Visual Analogue scale , Digital Vigilance , Stroop RVIP follow second set Visual Analogue scale ) . On 3 test day participant arrive lab morning ( 8:30 ) , overnight fast , firstly give 10 mL venous blood sample take trained phlebotomist . Participants blood glucose measured via finger prick heart rate/blood pressure ( autonomic measure ) measure use automate digital blood pressure monitor . Participants complete one repetition COMPASS computerise cognitive assessment battery ( baseline ) . Participants orally supplement treatment form single serve juice drink . After 60 minute absorption period , autonomic measurement second blood glucose read take . Participants complete COMPASS assessment . After completion assessment , third set autonomic measurement immediately take along third blood glucose read second 10 mL venous blood sample .</detailed_description>
