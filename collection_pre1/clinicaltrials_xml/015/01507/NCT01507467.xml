	<brief_title>IAEA-HypoX . Accelerated Radiotherapy With Without Nimorazole Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma head &amp; neck region ( HNSCC ) account approximately 7 % cancer worldwide &amp; around 75 % HNSCC case see less developed country . Significant improvement loco-regional control &amp; disease specific survival radiation therapy could achieve reduce overall treatment time `` Accelerated Fractionation '' schedule . Modification hypoxia Nimorazole demonstrate significant improved local effect radiation neither serious last side effect . So , expect optimal treatment option reduce overall treatment time concomitant use Nimorazole . Such treatment principle optimal test develop country . The aim study : - To determine possible therapeutic gain use nimorazole give hypoxic radiosensitizer conjunction accelerate fractionated radiotherapy invasive squamous cell carcinoma larynx , pharynx oral cavity , - To determine whether addition Nimorazole primary curative radiotherapy feasible tolerable worldwide scale . - To evaluate tolerance , compliance toxicity use nimorazole .</detailed_description>
