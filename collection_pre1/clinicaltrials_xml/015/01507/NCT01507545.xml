	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common new cancer diagnosis 2011 estimate , far , common digestive system cancer . The number anticipate new case 2011 US 141,210 , equally distribute men woman . Tumor endothelial marker-1 also refer TEM-1 express supportive tissue , well , cell within tumor . TEM-1 , cell surface glycoprotein , express stromal compartment ( cell ) nearly human tumor . In preclinical study , show TEM-1 play key role tumor growth vascularization tumor . There evidence suggest association level TEM-1 , 7 , 7R , 8 relation lymph node involvement disease progression . MORAb-004 humanize immunoglobulin G ( IgG1/Îº ) antibody direct endosialin/TEM-1 . Nonclinical pharmacological study show MORAb-004 ability block specific TEM-1 receptor-ligand interaction . Immunohistochemistry study human tumor biopsy sample demonstrate TEM-1 expression MORAb-004 binding tumor stromal cell , particular mural cell compartment neovessels cancer-associated fibroblast . All suggest potential effective treatment . Researchers hypothesize antibody therapy bind TEM-1 may efficacious treatment metastatic , colorectal cancer . This clinical trial proof concept study see anti-TEM-1 agent safe effective treatment metastatic , colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
