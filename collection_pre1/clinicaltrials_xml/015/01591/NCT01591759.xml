	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Citicoline Individuals With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain major cause death disability within United States . Approximately 1.4 million individual sustain TBI year , currently , 5.3 million Americans 3 % general population live disability associate TBI , result enormous financial , physical psychosocial burden patient , family society . The issue TBI never salient , label `` signature wound '' current conflict Iraq Afghanistan . Patients mTBI often experience variety symptom include headache , dizziness , fatigue , irritability , depression , anxiety , insomnia , reduce alcohol tolerance , problem cognitive function . In acute stage , cognitive deficit may affect multiple domain severe enough interfere everyday activity . The propose investigation explore impact 8 week citicoline treatment cognitive function , clinical state substance use 40 individual mTBI . The investigator hypothesize individual mTBI receive citicoline demonstrate improvement cognitive performance relative pre-treatment level well randomize placebo . Specifically , investigator expect great improvement frontal/executive measure follow treatment citicoline . In addition , investigator also hypothesize 8 week treatment citicoline result reduction comorbid substance use improvement clinical state measure relative pre-treatment level randomize receive placebo . Given relationship cognitive function clinical state , investigator expect primary improvement cognitive function likely precede expect improvement mTBI-related symptom .</detailed_description>
