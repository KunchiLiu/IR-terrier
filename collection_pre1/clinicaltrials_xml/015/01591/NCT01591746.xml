	<brief_summary>Each year , number breast cancer survivor choose post-mastectomy breast reconstruction keep rise . Among woman elect pursue breast reconstruction , approximately 75 % choose prosthetic breast reconstruction . Implant-based breast reconstruction frequently achieve two-stages . The first stage consist placement tissue expander mastectomy . This follow period biweekly tissue expansion last several month . In second stage , tissue expander remove surgical procedure replace permanent breast implant . Tissue expansion well-established breast reconstruction technique characterize high success rate high patient satisfaction . Despite well-recognized advantage successful breast reconstruction technique , subpectoral placement tissue expander associate significant pain discomfort immediate post-operative period phase tissue expansion . Pectoralis major muscle spasm frequently report problem tissue expansion . Legeby et al . recently show woman underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction high pain score take analgesic choose post-mastectomy reconstruction . In past 10 year , publication use BTX-A pain relief wide array clinical condition increase tremendously . BTX-A one neurotoxins produce Clostridium botulinum bacteria . By reversibly inhibit neurotransmitter release , BTX-A analgesic paralytic property . The analgesic action BTX-A initially think related effect muscular contraction . However , recent vitro study embryonic rat dorsal neuron confirm BTX-A inhibits release substance P , neurotransmitter associate pain inflammatory reaction . The presence analgesic property BTX-A increasingly support several clinical observation : pain relief BTX-A injection report migraine headache , chronic pelvic , chronic tennis elbow , post-operative pain control low limb lengthen correction , among others . This aspect never study breast cancer survivor elect pursue breast reconstruction tissue expanders . Furthermore , physical function outcome important consider BTX-A use link temporary muscle paralysis improvement participation daily activity give . The investigator propose complete double-blinded prospective randomize control trial woman undergo unilateral bilateral mastectomy immediate placement tissue expanders , establish efficacy safety BTX-A alleviate pain improve physical well-being expansion period .</brief_summary>
