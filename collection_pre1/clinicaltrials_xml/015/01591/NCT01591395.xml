	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia one common surgical disease adult . Tension free hernioplasty regard gold standard treatment adult inguinal hernia . The reported incidence hernia recurrence tension free repair le 5 percent . Over past year , safety feasibility laparoscopy establish gain popularity recent year . With advance technology , laparoscopic approach become standard treatment cholecystectomy adrenalectomy . Laparoscopic procedures improved surgical precision enhance visualization , magnification limit exposure , dissection . Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair associate less postoperative pain , short recovery period , early return normal daily activity work , well cosmetic result . The laparoscopic hernia repair usually require three work port range 5 10 mm . However , increase laparoscopic port usually associate possible increase morbidity pain related port . Efforts continue reduce port relate morbidity improve cosmetic outcome laparoscopic surgery , include reduction size number port . This led evolution novel surgical approach collectively know laparoendoscopic single-site surgery . LESS perform variable indication include extirpative reconstructive urologic procedure via transperitoneal approach . Early experience demonstrate feasibility well safe successful completion LESS procedure . Although initial report promising , clinical advantage LESS procedures conventional laparoscopic procedure define . To date , LESS hernia repair rarely report literature except case report one small series . Although initial report reveal LESS hernia repair safe feasible adult inguinal hernia , definite clinical benefit LESS hernia repair could identify small short term report . Thus , prospective randomize trial compare LESS conventional multiport laparoscopic hernia repair long-term follow mandatory define clinical advantage LESS hernia repair . Therefore , conduct randomized trial compare LESS total extraperitoneal hernia repair conventional multiport TEP repair adult inguinal hernia inflammatory , gonadal response , complication rate recurrence rate pain score , functional status activity level . Overall Goal -To compare surgical outcome , patient center outcomes surgery induced inflammatory , gonadal response LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair adult . Specific Aims - Compare surgery induce inflammatory response LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair inflammatory marker blood sample operation . - Compare surgery induce testicle change male adult LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair color Doppler ultrasonography determine testicular volume resistive index surgery 3 month postoperatively . - Compare postoperative pain score LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair Visual analog pain score . - Compare postoperative activity level LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair modify Medical Outcome Study . - Compare clinical result complication rate LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair clinic follow . - Compare longterm functional outcome 6 month LESS TEP conventional multiport TEP hernia repair follow questionnaire .</detailed_description>
