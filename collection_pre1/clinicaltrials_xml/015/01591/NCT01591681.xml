	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether low blood sugar night reduce use system turn insulin pump automatically . The study system include combination continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) / insulin pump make Medtronic MiniMed , Inc regular laptop computer run computer program predicts low blood sugar . It work ( 1 ) measure glucose level skin continuous glucose monitor , ( 2 ) use computer program laptop predict happen glucose level next 35-55 minute , ( 3 ) turn insulin pump computer program predicts low blood sugar occur . This study several phase take 3 month patient complete . Patients use Medtronic CGM Enlite sensor home 10-15 day sure able willing use system determine meet investigator study criterion proceed next phase study . Patients provide teach use CGM data real time . If patient use Medtronic CGM already , patient first use one home 10-15 day sure he/she able willing use . If patient already use Medtronic CGM , his/her recent 10-15 day data use find he/she eligible . Those need complete CGM run-in phase extra office visit training . If eligible continue study , patient need use study system 5 night home investigator make sure able use correctly . After , patient ask use study system night additional 6 8 week . If system active predict patient 's blood sugar become low , insulin pump shut 2 hour . The study include 45 individual 3 clinical center United States Canada .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Pump Shutoff Pilot Feasibility Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients eligible clinical trial initially use Medtronic Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) home verify subject able use CGM insert sensor . Subjects already use Medtronic CGM skip phase , provide eligibility criterion CGM use study meet . Patients meet criterion sensor use study use closed-loop system home 5 day demonstrate ability use system submit study data Coordinating Center . Patients successfully demonstrate ability use system home describe eligible randomized trial phase . This phase consist use full system outpatient approximately 42 night : - Each night blood glucose level check study home blood glucose ( BG ) meter use perform calibration CGM . This calibration must occur 90 minute prior activation system . NOTE : Patients instructed calibrate CGM per manufacturer guideline . - Then system activate , link CGM insulin pump computer bedside . - A randomization schedule laptop use determine whether 'pump shut ' application active night . - Patients blind whether pump shut active session initiate night . - There alarm pump shuts . The CGM alarm set 60 mg/dL ( 3.3 mmol/L ) . When CGM alarm occurs , patient ask measure blood glucose BG meter , he/she aware alarm . - The time period outcome assessment night time system activate turned morning - Pump shut , occur , 2 hour . Multiple instance pump suspension occur recurrent prediction hypoglycemia night . - Patients ask check blood glucose study BG meter , blood ketone study ketone meter , urine ketone ketone strip morning prior breakfast enter result study laptop . The patient instruct contact study physician blood glucose ketone reading expect range . Patients contact morning safety value report required range . - Patients ask record overnight carbohydrate intake study laptop . - Patients ask perform periodic data uploads use study laptop . Monitoring process ensure patient contact uploads occur require , review upload reveals extreme , prolong episode low high blood glucose reading , elevate morning blood glucose , blood ketone , urine ketone value . Upon completion study , patient well study clinician ask complete questionnaire regard use study system . There one follow-up visit 21 day clinical trial second follow-up visit completion 42 night successful study system use . A successful night study system use define use system least four hour . Phone contact patient make week .</detailed_description>
