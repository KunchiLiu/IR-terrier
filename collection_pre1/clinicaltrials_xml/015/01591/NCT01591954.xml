	<brief_summary>Current standard care complex head , neck skull base surgery require navigation system allow instrument track optically electromagnetically registered patient 's pre-operative X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) . However , conventionally , CT/MRI data register video endoscopy . Augmentation endoscopic video preoperative data facilitate navigation around critical structure robust target resection . The work present describes evaluation high definition ( HD ) video-overlay system endonasal endoscopic skull base surgery . We adopt modular design extend video augmentation application . The system support fast automatic camera calibration , comparable re-projection error standard camera calibration tool , perform within appropriate run time clinical use . Phantom study show registration accuracy system equivalent conventional optical tracking . With system propose clinical pilot study small number patient Johns Hopkins Hospital evaluate basic feasibility gather qualitative assessment video augmentation system .</brief_summary>
