	<detailed_description>Low-dose aspirin ( ASA ) emerge important cause peptic ulcer bleed worldwide . In western country , ASA overtaken NSAIDs major cause peptic ulcer bleed elderly population [ 1,2 ] . Management peptic ulcer bleed patient receive ASA cardiothrombotic disease clinical dilemma . In randomized trial continuous versus interrupt ASA therapy endoscopic treatment peptic ulcer bleeding , patient discontinue ASA 10-fold increase incidence all-cause mortality compare receive continuous ASA therapy . On hand , patient receive continuous ASA therapy two-fold increase risk early rebleeding [ 3 ] . Thus , prevent occurrence peptic ulcer bleed ASA user important reduce morbidity mortality . Emerging evidence secondary analysis cardiovascular trial suggest aspirin also reduce risk cancer , even cardioprotective dos [ 4 ] . With increase use ASA cardiothrombotic disease cancer prevention , global burden ASA-associated peptic ulcer disease expect increase . A number risk factor know increase risk peptic ulcer bleed ASA use . These include history peptic ulcer ulcer bleeding , old age , renal failure , concurrent use ASA clopidogrel , Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) infection [ 5-7 ] . Among risk factor , concomitant use clopidogrel history peptic ulcer bleed important predictor ulcer bleed ASA use [ 7 ] . On hand , Hp risk factor modify . Eradication Hp therefore offer hope reduce risk ulcer bleed ASA user . Current European U.S. guideline unanimously recommend test-and-treat Hp infection ASA user risk ulcer bleed [ 8-10 ] . Despite guideline , long-term benefit eradicate Hp high-risk ASA user uncertain . In 6-month randomized trial ASA user Hp infection complicate ulcer bleeding , patient randomize one-week Hp eradication therapy alone maintenance treatment omeprazole ulcer heal . Our result show incidence recurrent ulcer bleed comparable group receive Hp eradication alone ( 1.9 % ) group receive omeprazole ( 0.9 % ) [ 11 ] . In another 12-month randomized trial , ASA user Hp infection complicate ulcer bleed randomize one-week eradication therapy alone one week eradication therapy plus maintenance treatment lansoprazole . In study , 15 % ASA user develop recurrent ulcer bleed eradication Hp alone . Among ASA user develop recurrent ulcer bleeding , however , two-thirds failure Hp eradication use concomitant NSAIDs [ 12 ] . In light conflict finding , current guideline recommend co-therapy proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) still need high-risk ASA user eradication Hp [ 8-10 ] . Since PPIs effective prevent ASA-associated ulcer presence Hp infection [ 13 ] , clinical relevance test Hp high-risk ASA user becomes even questionable . To date , strategy test-and-treat Hp ASA user popular among primary care doctor specialist . One alternative gastroprotective strategy prescribe PPIs ASA user high risk ulcer bleed ignore Hp testing . However , poor compliance gastroprotective co-therapy limit effectiveness . Recently , health authority issue warn use PPI risk hip fracture potential adverse drug-interactions PPI clopidogrel [ 14,15 ] . Clopidgorel commonly use combination ASA prevent coronary stent thrombosis dual anti-platelet therapy substantially increase risk ulcer bleed [ 5 ] . If eradication Hp reduce long-term risk ulcer bleed ASA use , may potential hope limit PPI use high risk ASA user . Given uncertain clinical utility Hp test ASA user , prospective cohort study aim determine whether test Hp impact long-term incidence ulcer bleed ASA user high ulcer risk . The investigator hypothesize among ASA user Hp infection ulcer bleeding , long-term incidence recurrent ulcer bleed ASA use low eradication Hp alone .</detailed_description>
