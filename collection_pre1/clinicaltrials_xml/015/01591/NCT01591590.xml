	<brief_title>Correlating Tumoral Metabolic Progression Index Patient 's Outcome Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Natural history tumor poorly study subject , clinical evidence tumor aggressiveness oppose 's indolent behavior never formally assessed daily practice clinical study remain largely unpredictable . The patient 's population fact mix different tumoral phenotype carry apparent disease evolve different outcome . We hypothesize , population patient advance colorectal cancer know effective therapy available , measure spontaneous evolution tumoral metabolic progression index serial FGD PET-CT Diffusion MRI show tumor growth rate relate patient 's outcome , serial FDG PET-CT Diffusion MRI able measure . If hypothesis verify , find could : - Allow define therapeutic strategy accord tumoral metabolic progression index . - Limit need randomization early drug development phase patient could consider control . - To stratify patient accord baseline metabolic growth rate randomize control trial overall survival endpoint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm colorectal cancer metastatic unresectable standard treatment exist longer effective . The tumor refractory standard chemotherapy agent ( fluoropyrimidines , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ) anti‐EGFR monoclonal antibody case wild type Kras ( cetuximab panitumumab ) administer study entry . Prior treatment bevacizumab , regorafenib and/or aflibercept allow mandatory Participants candidate Phase I study Age equal 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Total bilirubin within 2 × normal institutional upper limit AST/ALT/Alk Phosphatase level &lt; 5 × normal institutional upper limit Creatinine within 2 × normal institutional upper limit creatinine clearance &gt; 35mL/min Women child‐bearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry assessment . For woman childbearing potential pregnancy test ( urinary serum ) must perform within 7 day prior inclusion must negative . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately within one month . Signed write informed consent obtain prior study specific screen procedure ) . Patients exhibit following condition screen eligible admission study : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants major surgery radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study . Patients receive experimental agent assessment time period . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Bleeding diathesis , history cardiovascular ischemic disease cerebrovascular incident within last six month . Participants major surgery radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness significant disease , investigator 's opinion , would exclude patient study . Pregnancy breastfeed FDG PETCT scan examination Uncontrolled Diabetes . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Contraindications use MRI : cardiac stimulator , implanted cardiac wire , implant electronic device , intraocular metallic foreign body . Medical , geographical , sociological , psychological legal condition would permit patient complete study sign inform consent .</criteria>
