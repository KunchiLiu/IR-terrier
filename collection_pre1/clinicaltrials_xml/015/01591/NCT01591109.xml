	<brief_summary>Objective : To assess effect bevacizumab tumor vessel , reversibility effect , use contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS ) histology patient metastatic liver tumor derive colorectal cancer . Background Data : Direct evidence reversibility change tumor vascularity upon bevacizumab cessation clinical setting lacking . Methods : The study include 10 patient receive chemotherapy include bevacizumab , experienced reduction tumor vascularity demonstrate CEUS consequently underwent liver resection . CEUS perform immediately 4 course chemotherapy one day surgery . The number microvessels highlight anti-CD34 antibody viable tumor tissue count quantify microvessel density ( MVD ) . As control , 10 surgical specimen 10 patient receive chemotherapy examine .</brief_summary>
