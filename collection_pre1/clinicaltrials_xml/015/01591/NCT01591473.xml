	<brief_title>Safety Study FluMist With Without Ampligen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza epidemic continue represent significant medical problem develop well develop world . Even exist vaccine , annual influenza epidemic typically result 20-50 million case , result 30,000-40,000 death U.S. alone . A possible pandemic could even devastate consequence . Current vaccine number disadvantage include slow expensive manufacturing , relative lack efficacy elderly , child immune-compromised population . These disadvantage would multiply pandemic . Use Ampligen® adjuvant combine FluMist® number potential advantage compare traditional inactivated vaccine : simpler administer ( intranasally ) , generation broad immunity natural site entry influenza virus well systemic immunity ( hence efficacious traditional vaccine ) may stimulate cross-protection pre-pandemic H5N1 and/or H7N9 avian influenza strain . As FluMist® , due intranasal administration , imitate natural entry influenza virus , generate local 'first-line ' immunity well traditional systemic immunity ; therefore , least theoretically provide great protection injectable vaccine .</detailed_description>
