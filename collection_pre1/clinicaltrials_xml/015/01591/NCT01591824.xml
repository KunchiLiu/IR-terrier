	<brief_summary>Through research conduct pilot clinical trial treatment chronic nonspecific low back pain ( degenerative mechanical ) , compare two group , one apply technique physiotherapy passive movement column oscillation axial rotation frequency 1.5 2 cps ( resonance ) low amplitude ( call `` Pold Concept '' ) , another group apply standard protocol treatment condition , use hospital perform study . It compare level efficiency effectiveness treatment comparison . This measure perception pain intensity disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type study : This analytical study , experimental group clinical trial type , control , randomize complete randomization single blind . Two group , study POLD treatment shall apply , control group conventional treatment form complete randomization system arrive consultation , total 50 patient need group minimum 25 offset dropout . The number 25 patient per group determine consider accept alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.20 bilateral contrast , require least 21 subject group detect minimum difference 15 percentage point two group , therefore two group 25 assume standard deviation 15 point loss rate 0 % track form . We study effectiveness efficiency individually comparatively group . - Study population : 1 . The sample select patient attend clinic back pain medical diagnosis refer physiotherapist report diagnosis , prescribe physical therapy meet criterion inclusion exclusion . 2 . A total 25 patient experimental group 25 standard treatment group select . 3 . If loss sample replace others maintain proportion . - The selection group : RANDOM use , form experimental group control direct patient overall incorporate randomly accord study : 1 . Group A ( study ) apply technique identical protocol POLD . 2 . Group B ( conventional control ) apply average conventional treatment different physiotherapy center reference . - Study variable collect : 1 . Subjective assessment pain intensity use VAS , visual analog pain . , 2 . Evolution disability Oswestry test . 3 . SF-12 health . - Statistical analysis : Computer analysis use `` SPSS '' 13.0 ® process program . The study process follow : First , initial analysis perform verify significant difference group baseline value dependent variable Student 's test independent sample . Second : For dependent variable variance analysis apply use general linear model 2x10 subject factor call variable `` Treatment `` two category 1 , 2 ( experimental group = 1 , conventional group = 2 ) temporal within-subjects factor call `` SHOOT '' ( 10 session ) . Third : We analyze treatment session difference two group appear Student 's test independent data first session Fourth , interaction study compare two group first , fifth 10th session use Student test independent data compare result group 1st 5th session 1st 10th session Student pair data . • Ethical Issues : During study national international guideline ( code ethic , Declaration Helsinki ) continue , likewise legal regulation data privacy ( Law 15 /1999 13 December Protection Personal Data )</detailed_description>
