	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Two Prone Breast Radiotherapy Techniques With Randomization Concurrent Versus Weekly Boost</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During past ten year Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Research team NYU conduct series consecutive study optimize safe delivery accelerate radiotherapy partial whole breast prone position , summarized recent review experience . The current protocol focus whole breast radiotherapy woman stage 0-2 breast cancer treat segmental mastectomy : aim refine role prone IMRT versus 3D-conformal radiotherapy technique common subset patient . This study open label randomize trial . Patients randomize within cohort define assign treatment ( 3D CRT IMRT cover IMRT ) within primary stratum menopausal status ( pre/post ) chemotherapy prior radiation ( yes/no ) . The on-site treatment randomization assignment do site treatment assignment provide Research Nurse confirm eligibility . Patients randomize within primary stratum base presumed insurance coverage consent study allow simulation proceed . Should coverage change , patient re-randomized correct stratum initial randomization number retire notation initial stratification revise patient re-randomized . Patients complete breast surgical procedure prior accrual protocol order establish eligibility criterion . Final pathology margin must least 1 mm direction eligible . The patient may undergo re-excision initial margin involve close ( &lt; 1mm ) . If patient meet eligibility criterion re-excision , may enter onto study .</detailed_description>
