	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety effect combination study drug , Lapatinib , plus administration standard radiation therapy FDA approve drug Temozolomide ( chemotherapy agent ) patient newly diagnozed glioblastoma Multiforme.Currently , radiation therapy Temozolomide chemotherapy standard treatment brain cancer.Lapatinib FDA approve use brain tumor treatment . It approve used daily treatment chemotherapy FDA treatment advance breast cancer . The purpose study find answer follow research question : 1 . Is Lapatinib give twice week high dosage , radiation therapy Temozolomide , safe give patient brain tumor ? 2 . What side effect Lapatinib give twice week high dosage give radiation therapy Temozolomide often occur ? 3 . Can Lapatinib , radiation , Temozolomide effective shrinking tumor give patient brain tumor ? 4 . To determine whether presence genetic alteration specific protein tumor sample predict whether study drug effective tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients include study base follow criterion : Patients histologically prove intracranial Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) gliosarcoma ( GS ) . This include treatmentnaïve patient prior tissue diagnosis low grade glioma upgrade GBM repeat resection . Patients must available archive tissue 2030 unstained slide . If frozen tissue available , least 200mg would prefer , mandatory study eligibility . Use effective mean contraception ( men woman ) subject childbearing potential Cranial MRI contrast CT must perform within 21 day study entry . The use MRI rather CT prefer . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . If surgical procedure resection , cranial MRI contrast CT perform within 96 hour resection prefer require . If surgical procedure biopsy , head CT within 96 hour biopsy acceptable . Patients without measurable assessable disease eligible . Patients must begin partial brain radiotherapy temozolomide chemotherapy sooner 2 week later 5 week surgery tissue collect . Patients GBM diagnosis surgery tissue collect eligible repeat surgery perform collect tissue , long treatment initiate prior surgery tissue collect . In case , initiation treatment must begin within 2 5 week last surgery . Patients may radiotherapy administer outside facility accord specify guideline ( Appendix F ) . Radiotherapy must give within 2 day lapatinib initiation external beam partial brain field daily fraction 2.0 Gy , plan total dose tumor 60.0 Gy accordance Appendix F. Stereotactic radiosurgery brachytherapy allow . Patients must willing forego drug therapy tumor treat pulse dose lapatinib temozolomide radiation subsequently pulse dose lapatinib temozolomide . All patient must sign informed consent approve Institutional Review Board indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Patients must &gt; 18 year old , life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC &gt; 3,000/µl , ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl ) test must perform within 14 day prior treatment initiation . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must adequate liver function ( AST , ALT &lt; 2.5 time ULN , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN ) test must perform within 14 day prior treatment initiation . Patients must adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ) start therapy test must perform within 14 day prior treatment initiation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients receive previous radiotherapy brain . Patients receive cytotoxic drug therapy , noncytotoxic drug therapy , experimental drug therapy direct brain tumor . Patients receive Gliadel wafer exclude . Patients may receive receive corticosteroid , analgesic , drug treat symptom prevent complication . Patients may receive EIAED ( see Appendix C ) within 2 week prior registration , prohibit medication within Washout Period per Appendix D prior registration . See section 6.5 seizure medication management . Patients significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Women pregnant ( determined high titer serum betaHCG ) Breastfeeding . ( Women reproductive potential must practice adequate contraception . ) Patients disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patients serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require IV antibiotic psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , disorder associate significant immunocompromised state ( HIV , SLE , etc. ) . Patients current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) .</criteria>
