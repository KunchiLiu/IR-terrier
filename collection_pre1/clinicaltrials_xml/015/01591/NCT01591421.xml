	<brief_title>P13Kinase Inhibitor BKM120 Combination With Panitumumab Patients With Metastatic Advanced RAS-Wild Type Colorectal Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This do starting dos BKM120 low usual dose . Patients give BKM120 panitumumab watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , patient ask join study give high dos BKM120 . If severe toxicity see , dose BKM120 and/or panitumumab dos may lower subsequent patient . Patients join study later normally get high dos BKM120 patient join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic proof primary colorectal cancer recurrent metastatic . Tumour must confirm KRas wild type ( i.e . KRas mutation find ) mean mutation analysis perform representative sample diagnostic tumour tissue standard regional provincial laboratory eligible receive standard panitumumab treatment per local guideline ( i.e . must fail , unable receive prior irinotecan , oxaliplatin thymidylate synthase inhibitor therapy ) . Note : Archival tumour sample acceptable KRas mutation analysis . In phase I portion trial , patient may measurable OR nonmeasurable disease . Patients whose evidence disease progression tumour marker elevation eligible . In phase II portion trial , patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . The criterion define measurable disease follow : Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm → long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm → measure short axis Patients must recover recent surgery , chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy significant toxicity must recover ≤ grade 2 . At least 4 week must elapse major surgery radiation therapy , unless radiation low dose , involve mucosa nonmyelosuppressive . Patient must recover ( grade 01 ) reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy adequate washout prior chemotherapy investigational agent follow : Washout period long one following : 1. two week 2. standard cycle length prior regimen ( i.e . 21 day irinotecan q 3 week ) . 3 . 10 halflives investigational drug . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 .

Where local centre regulation prohibit submission block tumour tissue , approval NCIC CTG must seek prior registration first patient allow predetermine number slide representative tumour tissue substitute response Central Tumour Bank request . Failure submit tissue sample request result patient consider ineligible . Where previously resect biopsied tumour tissue exists , approval NCIC CTG , patient may still consider eligible study . Age ≥ 18 year .

Patients reproductive potential must agree use highly effective contraception follow : Female study subject : study 6 month final dose study therapy Male study subject : study 16 week final dose study therapy . Female partner male study subject : study 16 week final dose study therapy Patient consent trial participation must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form provide . A copy initial full board Research Ethics Board ( REB ) approval approve consent form must send central office . The patient must sign consent form prior registration . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission qualify representative CCTG , monitoring agency regulatory authority review patient record . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Patients enrol trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . A history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Any active disease condition would render protocol treatment dangerous impair ability patient receive protocol therapy ( e.g . chronic pancreatitis , active chronic hepatitis , etc. ) .

Subjects sign symptom suggestive brain metastasis eligible unless brain metastasis rule CT MRI scan . Patients receive prior EGFR PI3 Kinase inhibitor therapy . Receipt investigational therapeutic agent within washout period define section 5.1.4 protocol . Severe restrictive lung disease radiological pulmonary finding `` interstitial lung disease '' baseline chest xray , opinion investigator , represent significant pathology . Patients impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption BKM120 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patients unable swallow capsule . Patients potent CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers ( must discontinue &gt; 7 day prior day 1 ) therapeutic dos warfarin like anticoagulant .
