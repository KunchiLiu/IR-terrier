	<brief_title>Exercise Vascular Function Haemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life expectancy haemodialysis patient significantly short general population due high cardiovascular disease risk . This mediate high prevalence cardiovascular risk factor associate chronic kidney disease haemodialysis procedure . Consequently age arterial system accelerate condition lead high prevalence arterial plaque increase arterial stiffness . Higher physical activity fitness associate low cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality haemodialysis patient general population . Moreover , physical inactivity associate increase arterial stiffness plaque narrow heart artery . Worryingly haemodialysis population average highly inactive low fitness . Current research demonstrate exercise improves fitness improve arterial health . Increased bloodflow exercise stimulate release nitric oxide cause artery dilate . Regular exercise believe lead beneficial remodelling artery lower arterial stiffness . Exercise report improve arterial function across range condition . However publish research regard possible benefit long term aerobic exercise arterial health population conflict . Limitations study design , moderately high participant dropout rate low statistical power hamper definitive conclusion . Importantly gold standard measure arterial function use previously publish study . There ample evidence exercise program people dialysis improve fitness , physical function , quality life . It also clear state higher physical activity fitness associate well arterial function general population . It would advantageous reason health counsel determine whether process improve physical fitness activity level may also improve arterial health haemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
