	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 6 participant enrol Part 1 study . Up 10 enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose siRNA-EphA2-DOPC receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose siRNA-EphA2-DOPC found . If enrol Part 2 , receive siRNA-EphA2-DOPC high dose tolerate Part 1 . Study Drug Administration : You receive siRNA-EphA2-DOPC 2 time week ( Days 1 4 week ) vein 120 minute ( +/- 10 minute ) . You give standard drug ( hydrocortisone , Benadryl [ diphenhydramine ] , Tylenol [ acetaminophen ] , dexamethasone ) help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Cycles study 3 week long . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , already procedures do within last week : - Any updates medical history record , include drug may take side effect may . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If able become pregnant , blood and/or urine use pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test study drug dose , 1 time dose , end dose , 6 time 6 hour dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - If third dose level Part 1 Part 2 , dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) scan , diffusion weight image MRI ( DWI-MRI ) scan , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan check study drug may able affect tumor . On Day 2 Cycle 1 ( 24 hour first study drug dose ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test . On Day 3 4 Cycle 1 : - You core biopsy site ( ) may test screen check status disease . This sample compare sample collect screening . - If third dose level Part 1 Part 2 , FDG-PET scan , DCE-MRI scan , DWI-MRI check status disease learn drug may affect tumor . On Day 4 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign weight measure . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test end study drug dose . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn routine test . - You ask side effect may . On Days 11 18 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign weight measure . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon draw routine test . Before Cycle 2 , third dose level Part 1 Part 2 , FDG-PET scan , DCE-MRI scan , DWI-MRI check status disease learn drug may affect tumor . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , weight . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect pregnancy test . On Days 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your vital sign weight measure . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - In Cycle 3 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw biomarker test . On Day 1 every even numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : You CT scan x-ray check status disease . Length Dosing : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , study drug dose delay 2 week , disease completely respond , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : After finish take study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You CT scan , MRI scan , x-ray check status disease . - You ECG . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect pregnancy test . This investigational study . siRNA-EphA2-DOPC FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 40 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . All patient histologic proof advanced solid tumor , candidate know regimen protocol treatment higher efficacy priority . 2 . Subject/patient must 18 year old ( dose adverse event data currently available use EphA2 siRNADOPC patient &lt; 18 year age ) . 3 . ECOG performance status &lt; /=2 . 4 . All patient ( dose escalation dose expansion phase ) must willing undergo pre posttreatment biopsy . 5 . For dose escalation phase , trial population limit solid tumor type 6 . For dose expansion phase : patient must EphA2 overexpression overall Hscore 3 IHC evaluation.CLIA certify EphA2 IHC stain perform formalin fix , paraffinembedded tissue section use monoclonal EphA2 antibody . EphA2 expression assess combo % positive cell stain intensity . The % positive cell rat : 0 point ( pt ) , 0 5 % ; 2 pt , 6 50 % ; 3 pt , 50 % . The stain intensity rat follow : 1 pt , weak intensity ; 2 pt , moderate intensity ; 3 pt , strong intensity . Pts expression % positive cell add ; overall score assign .
