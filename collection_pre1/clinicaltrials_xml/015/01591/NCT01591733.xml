	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness therapy learn whether therapy work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean therapy still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , therapy effective treat different type cancer . Proton beam radiation therapy FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve radiation delivery system . Proton beam radiation therapy know spare surround normal tissue radiation delivers le radiation beyond area target tissue . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience standard ( photon ) radiation therapy , tend include normal tissue along tumor target tissue . Researchers laboratory discover pathway inside cell lead growth survival tumor . The chemotherapy drug FOLFIRINOX capecitabine target towards block pathway allow cancer cell divide , may result tumor shrink size . In research study , investigator look determine proton beam radiation combination FOLFIRINOX capecitabine effective control growth cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For week 1-8 , receive FOLFIRINOX via IV infusion . The treatment plan begin four cycle ( 8 week ) FOLFIRINOX . Each cycle 14 day long . You receive FOLFIRINOX therapy day 1 , 2 3 four cycle . The FOLFIRINOX treatment broken three different drug . 5-FU administer two hour day one cycle , continuously pump day 2 3 . Oxaliplatin deliver intravenous ( infusion ) 120 minute . Irinotecan give IV 90 minute . All part treatment receive outpatient . If 4 cycle FOLFIRINOX therapy , tumor spread , receive 4 cycle FOLFIRINOX . If 8 total cycle FOLFIRINOX cancer clearly resectable , proceed phase 2 treatment capecitabine radiation therapy . You take tablet capecitabine mouth total 10 day ( Monday Friday ) two week FOLFIRINOX treatment . You give drug diary capecitabine contain instruction take drug . Short course radiation : You receive proton radiation treatment five day ( Monday Friday ) FOLFIRINOX treatment , time capecitabine treatment , photon radiation ten day ( Monday Friday two week ) . You also assess least treatment course side effect may experience . You receive study radiation treatment outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Center Clark Center Radiation Oncology Massachusetts General Hospital Surgery expect occur approximately one four week completion capecitabine therapy . After surgery , may receive additional chemotherapy discretion treat physician follow per standard care .</detailed_description>
