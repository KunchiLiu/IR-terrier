	<detailed_description>There large number young woman sustain serious knee injury play soccer . Female athletes high risk knee injury soccer male . We conduct research project assess effect warm-up change movement pattern think contribute serious knee injury . A core position control movement strategy ( Core-PAC ) may one method modify high-risk movement side-cutting . The Core-PAC simple method get centre mass ( COM ) closer plant foot base support ( BOS ) . Moving COM close BOS may bias joint load sagittal rather frontal transverse plane , often occur female athlete pose risk ACL injury . In study , conduct randomize controlled trial compare Core-PAC train group control group peak flexion angle peak abduction moment knee side-cut unanticipated side-cut prior kick soccer ball side-hop task six-week training program . It hypothesize Core-PAC group would great peak flexion angle low peak abduction moment knee compare control train program .</detailed_description>
