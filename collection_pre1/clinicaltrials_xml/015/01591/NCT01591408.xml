	<brief_summary>The propose study , `` Placebo-controlled study EEG biofeedback therapy adjunct treatment PTSD , evaluate symptom EEG dynamic '' , investigate brain dynamic associate PTSD symptom reduction associate EEG biofeedback therapy sham EEG biofeedback addition treatment usual Naval Medical Center , San Diego ( NMCSD ) OASIS program . EEG biofeedback treatment protocol PTSD disorder develop honed private practice clinician past 25 year , EEG biofeedback become increasingly popular adjunct therapy . The reported success EEG biofeedback non-drug intervention last efficacy warrant clinical study investigate symptom reduction , also underlie neurobiological mechanism . To end , propose study use high density EEG recording treatment PTSD symptom determine brain activity correlate report symptom change . The propose study could expand treatment alternative servicemen PTSD . If EEG biofeedback show improve symptom reduction placebo control condition , would offer non-pharmacological intervention would avoid undesirable side effect , accelerate recovery compare current standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EEG biofeedback emerge alternative approach treat PTSD , still insufficient evidence assume unequivocal clinical utility . However , 1991 report show PTSD symptom reduction 14 subject receive EEG biofeedback , compare 13 subject receive traditional treatment ( Peniston , 1991 ) , recent case study 2 PTSD patient receive EEG biofeedback therapy also show reduce symptom severity use new protocol device ( Othmer , 2009 ) . Another recent study focus anxiety symptom PTSD show EEG biofeedback significantly reduce anxiety compare subject receive treatment ( Walker , 2009 ) . EEG biofeedback also explore treatment non-PTSD related anxiety disorder , result show significant change report anxiety correlate increase decrease alpha-frequency ( ~8-12 Hz ) power ( Hardt , 1978 ) . Similarly , alpha-frequency EEG biofeedback show reduce anxiety reduce heart rate reactivity stressor 8 session EEG biofeedback training ( Rice , 1993 ) . While EEG biofeedback show significantly change EEG power dynamic ( Egner , 2004 ) , still unclear EEG biofeedback effect long-term complex change cognitive and/or emotional functioning . Some attention give type biofeedback treatment PTSD , heart rate variability ( HRV ) biofeedback , may relevant understand background biofeedback respect PTSD treatment . While one study report difference symptom reduction treatment usual treatment usual plus HRV biofeedback ( Lande , 2010 ) , handful study report significant association HRV change PTSD symptom . Specifically , increase HRV significantly correlate PTSD symptom reduction , effective respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) ( affect HRV ) biofeedback progressive muscle relaxation ( Zucker , 2009 ) . Furthermore , combat-related PTSD subject show low rest HRV control , train HRV biofeedback increase PTSD subject ' HRV simultaneously decrease PTSD symptom ( Tan , 2011 ) . Finally , quantitative EEG study show acute session RSA biofeedback associated increase alpha-band power reduce high frequency beta-band power , suggest neural impact RSA training HRV regulation ( Sherlin , 2010 ) . Summary The propose study EEG biofeedback OASIS program address clinical efficacy , also brain activation associate specific symptom PTSD collection high-density EEG data EEG biofeedback treatment . These data help elucidate neural correlate PTSD symptom expression well address potential efficacy EEG biofeedback therapy adjunct treatment PTSD-like symptom .</detailed_description>
