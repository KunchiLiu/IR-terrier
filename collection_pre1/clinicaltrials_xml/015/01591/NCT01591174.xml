	<brief_summary>The purpose research see difference child FD child without FD ability stomach empty food and/or ghrelin hormone level eat . Chronic abdominal pain common persistent pain condition child adolescent . One often diagnosed type abdominal pain functional dyspepsia ( FD ) . FD abdominal pain discomfort ( e.g. , nausea , bloat ) upper abdomen get good bowel movement . One possible explanation FD delay empty food stomach , delay gastric ( stomach ) emptying . Failing empty stomach quickly enough may result feel full cause symptom bloat , nausea , vomit pain . Further , hormonal change occur , , eat food appear impact stomach empty . One hormone change meal call ghrelin . The relationship ghrelin stomach empty need explored child FD . Better understanding cause FD symptom may help u improve treatment condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ghrelin Gastric Emptying Children With Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional Dyspepsia ( FD ) define presence persistent recurrent pain discomfort center upper abdomen evidence organic disease likely explain symptom . This pain discomfort must exclusively relieve defecation associate onset change stool frequency stool form . Initially , FD classification criterion include 3 subtypes : ulcer-like , pain predominant symptom ; dysmotility-like , discomfort predominant symptom ; , unspecified . In 2006 , however , criterion revise Rome III committee . In adult , previous FD subtypes eliminate replace two new subtypes : ( ) postprandial distress syndrome ( PDS ) , characterize postprandial fullness early satiety ; , ( ii ) epigastric pain syndrome ( EPS ) , characterize epigastric pain burning unrelated meal . In child , Rome II subtypes eliminate completely . Although Rome III subtypes apply within adult criterion , also appear meaningful association child FD may support adoption later revision criterion . Specifically , inflammation ( reflect mast cell density ) self report anxiety depression appear uniquely associate PDS child . FD common disorder upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , occur 26 % 34 % general population . FD present many 80 % child evaluate chronic abdominal pain . FD best explain biopsychological model dysfunction within brain-gut axis . The model suggest FD result interaction biological ( e.g. , inflammation , mechanical , sensory dysfunction ) , psychological ( e.g. , anxiety , depression , somatization ) , social ( e.g. , interaction parent , teacher , peer ) factor , may interactive . Delayed gastric empty one mechanical factor implicate . Other mechanisms visceral hypersensitivity impair gastric fundic accommodation . Delayed gastric empty show 66 % child FD . Most previous study child use solid GE measure explain function pyloric empty . However , liquid GE good measure predict function fundic accommodation , visceral hypersensitivity well pyloric emptying , , mechanism suggest mechanical pathophysiological model FD specifically PDS subtypes . In order measure gastric emptying ( GE ) , 13C-acetate breath test ( ABT ) potential replace 99mtechnetium colloid-based scintigraphy `` gold standard '' measure GE . ABT advantage scintigraphy rapid , technically simple , safe inexpensive mean assess liquid GE child . As , may easily utilize diagnostic technique standard clinical practice . Gastric motility mainly regulate extrinsic autonomic nerve , intrinsic neuron stomach , GI hormones . It hypothesize hormone strongly affect hunger energy expenditure may alter dyspeptic disorder affect gastric motility . Because altered gut-brain interaction may underlie symptom generation FD ghrelin important gut peptide relate gut-brain axis , plasma concentration ghrelin patient FD investigate several study . Ghrelin motilin-related peptide mainly synthesize release A-like cell stomach . Ghrelin act endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHSR ) . Ghrelin receptor present anterior pituitary hypothalamus . There two form ghrelin . The first form acyl ghrelin , comprise 28 amino acid residue n-octanoyl ester Ser3 essential biologic activity , act endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a ( GHS-R1a ) . Acyl ghrelin easily rapidly degrade second form , desacyl ghrelin , small fragment . Functionally , ghrelin level progressively rise fast peak prior meal fall low level hour eat . Ghrelin level start increase approximately 2 hour eat peak next meal . A close relationship document ghrelin gastric motility rat . In human , demonstrate ghrelin increase gastric empty rate healthy , obese , control . Ghrelin well-established role increase appetite food intake . These piece evidence lead speculation alter ghrelin function may contribute disturbed gastric motility appetite loss see FD . Moreover , ghrelin agonist administration find stimulatory effect appetite FD patient idiopathic gastroparesis . Considering symptom FD typically relate food intake , postprandial ghrelin level investigate several study . It show fast ghrelin level , general , inversely related gastric emptying time ( , e. , low fast ghrelin associate great delay GE ) . However , relation disrupt FD patient , patient demonstrate increase fasting ghrelin level . Although result somewhat conflict , previous study support role ghrelin FD adult . Takamori et al . report fast desacyl total ghrelin level significantly low FD patient control . Further , fast postprandial level significantly different FD , compare significant drop fast postprandial level see control , suggest fast ghrelin increase expect fasting FD patient . Consistent , Lee et al . show delayed GE report majority adult FD abnormally low total pre-prandial ghrelin level observe . However , relationship FD ghrelin may differ FD subtype . Shindo et al . report fasting acyl ghrelin level significantly low PDS adult patient healthy volunteer . Further , demonstrate Tmax value reflective GE PDS patient significantly high healthy volunteer , measure use 13-C ( carbon ) acetate breath test . These result suggest acyl ghrelin biologically important might play role pathophysiology PDS subtype FD effect gastric empty . Collectively , previous study suggest relationship plasma ghrelin concentration FD , FD subtype , adult . Further , seem likely occurs impact ghrelin gastric empty adult . However , best knowledge , role ghrelin pediatric FD relation gastric motility child previously study . There need investigate possible role ghrelin two different form , well relation gastric motility , child FD group across possible subtypes order establish good understand pathophysiology FD . This study may help build mechanical pathway model FD etiology , explore pharmacokinetics ghrelin hormone , establish correlation liquid gastric emptying . If relationship establish , future work explore potential therapeutic role ghrelin agonist FD specific FD subtypes .</detailed_description>
