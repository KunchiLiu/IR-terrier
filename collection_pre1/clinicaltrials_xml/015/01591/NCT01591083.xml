	<brief_summary>Patients comorbidities increase risk ulcer re-bleeding , especially within 14 day first bleed event . Three-day high dose esomeprazole infusion prevent peptic ulcer rebleeding endoscopic therapy . However , optimal dose oral esomeprazole uncertain , especially high risky patient . This study test whether double dose oral esomprazole could reduce peptic ulcer rebleeding patient Rockall score â‰¥ 6 . Additionally , second aim prospective study identify selection criterion predict poor fade residual major stigma recent hemorrhage ( SRH ) early recurrent bleed successful endoscopic hemostasis high-dose PPI infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Double Doses Oral Esomeprazole Preventing Rebleeding Patients With Bleeding Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peptic ulcer bleed common lethal disease , recurrent bleeding independent risk factor lead mortality . The recurrent bleed peptic ulcer relate presence stigma recent hemorrhage ( SRH ) . The fading time SRH around 3 6 day , therefore , recurrent bleeding develops within 2-3 day first bleed episode . The aim acute treatment peptic ulcer bleed reduce recurrent bleed use anti-secretory drug . Accordingly , common duration omeprazole infusion apply 3 day endoscopic therapy . Moreover , recurrent bleeding also positively link presence co-morbidities . In general , patient underlie medical co-morbidities increase rate recurrent bleed long duration risk recurrent bleed without co-morbidity . Nonetheless , even continuous infusion omeprazole 3 day , recurrent bleeding rate remain high certain patient presence underlying medical co-morbidities . Moreover , duration peptic ulcer recurrent bleeding elongate 14th day first bleed episode patient co-morbidities . To prevent recurrent bleed high risk patient , show therapeutic benefit prolonged course 7-day low-dose intravenous omeprazole , exert well recurrent bleed control 3-day high-dose infusion . The intragastric 24-h median pH 4.9 patient oral 40 mg omeprazole daily , significantly high baseline pH healthy subject . However , gastric acid secretion suppress completely 24 hour oral omeprazole 40 mg daily . Several study show oral high-dose PPI equally effective raise intragastric pH 6 reduce recurrent bleed intravenous route . Hence , study aim test whether high dose oral esomeprazole , effective maintain favorable intragastric pH , could effectively reduce ulcer rebleeding patient comorbidities . This data show originality clinical importance high dose oral esomeprazole high-risk patient comorbidities peptic ulcer bleeding . Additionally , endoscopic treatment plus 3-day intravenous proton pump inhibitor infusion standard protocol treatment peptic ulcer bleeding . Moreover , several study show PPI treatment prior endoscopy could decrease presentation SRH need endoscopic hemostasis . However , insufficient data validate efficacy standard treatment fade SRH . Therefore , several study look efficacy routine second-look endoscopy , define schedule repeat endoscopy primary endoscopic hemostasis patient high risk rebleeding . However , role second-look endoscopy selection criterion patient require second-look endoscopy remain uncertain . There press need elucidate role second-look endoscopy patient peptic ulcer bleed high-dose PPI infusion . Hence , second aim prospective study identify selection criterion predict poor fade residual major SRH early recurrent bleed successful endoscopic hemostasis high-dose PPI infusion . This data show originality clinical importance identify risk factor predict poor fading SRH current standard treatment patient indicate receive second-look endoscopy .</detailed_description>
