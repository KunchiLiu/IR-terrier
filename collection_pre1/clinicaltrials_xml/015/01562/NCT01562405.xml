	<brief_summary>It possible combination lenalidomide , dexamethasone ACE 011 may reduce prevent growth cancer cell along improve anemia bone lesion sometimes occur people multiple myeloma . This current study first study combine ACE 011 lenalidomide . In research study , investigator look high dose ACE 011 give lenalidomide dexamethasone . The investigator also begin collect information effect combination ACE 011 , lenalidomide dexamethasone multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : Assignment dose level study treatment Since look high dose ACE 011 combine lenalidomide administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant multiple myeloma , everyone participates research study receive dose drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Study treatment Study treatment give 28 day cycle . - ACE-011 give injection skin , Day 1 cycle ( every 28 day ) . You receive injection clinic . - Lenalidomide take mouth : daily day 1 21 , follow 7 day rest period lenalidomide take . - Dexamethasone take mouth per week ( day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ) cycle . You give drug diary record dose lenalidomide dexamethasone take . The study staff tell complete diary</detailed_description>

A line treatment sequential treatment without interruption response subsequent progression For participant treat local radiotherapy without concomitant exposure steroid , pain control management cord/nerve root compression , two week must lapse since last date radiotherapy , recommend limited field . Participants require concurrent radiotherapy entry protocol defer radiotherapy complete two week pass since last date therapy . ECOG performance status zero two unless decline due bony disease Not pregnant breastfeed Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants may receive treatment another investigational drug device within 28 day prior Day 1 , half life previous product know , within 5 time half life prior dose , whichever may longer Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ACE 011 , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy .
