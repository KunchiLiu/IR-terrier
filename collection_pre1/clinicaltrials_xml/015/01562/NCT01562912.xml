	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia affect Canadian population . AF associate increase risk stroke , heart failure , even mortality1 . AF also cause debilitate symptom adversely affect patient 's quality life functional status . These amongst several reason strategy sinus rhythm may pursue strategy allow AF persist2-6 . Percutaneous catheter ablation emerge effective alternative antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) maintain sinus rhythm7 . The cornerstone AF ablation procedure today electrical disconnection `` isolation '' pulmonary vein ( PV ) antra rest leave atrium ( LA ) 8-13 . In experienced hand , success rate PV isolation AAD 80-90 % patient paroxysmal AF , repeat procedure require 40 % patients14-18 . Thus , one ablation , success rate may 50-70 % drug . Current standard ablation procedure PV antral isolation employ map system reconstruction LA PV anatomy create . Visualization may supplement integration CT MRI image and/or intracardiac echocardiography . Robotic navigation system also employ assist ablation . The result ablation technology become complex costly . Furthermore , technology base single point unipolar radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation catheter lesion create point-by-point around PVs eventually obtain electrical isolation . This result lengthy procedure , often 4 hour , require high degree operator skill . Creation contiguous , transmural lesion also challenge standard single-point RF . Recently , novel multipolar catheter ablation system evaluate achieve PV isolation ( PVAC catheter , Ablation Frontiers , Medtronic Inc. , Minneapolis , MN ) . Based over-the-wire circular mapping ablation design , catheter advance PV antrum , multiple lesion around circumference catheter deliver simultaneously use duty-cycled unipolar bipolar RF energy . In early report , system achieve complete PV isolation reduce fluoroscopy procedural time use low power achieve reliable lesion sets19-21 . Long-term efficacy also seem comparable standard RF ablation22,23 . This novel technology potential broaden application AF ablation , make procedure less time-consuming less complex without compromise procedural efficacy . However , publish data outcomes relate use PVAC technology limit study relatively small sample size range 12 102 patients20-25 . Data restrict experience small number European center perform moderate number PVAC procedure prospective , multicenter data . The investigator therefore know little efficiency PVAC procedure , turn , may allow assessment cost-effectiveness use technology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency Study Evaluating Use PVAC Catheter Technology Performing Ablation Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , prospective , cohort study . Patients undergo ablation PVAC technology 15 center across Canada enrol , ablate , follow one year post-ablation . Both primary secondary objective study determine cohort patient . Comparisons traditional ablation method make collect data prospective group control subject undergoing AF ablation traditional ablation technology center operator . Control patient enrol 1:2 ratio compare PVAC cohort . While final ratio control PVAC patient must 1:2 study end operator , ratio may vary study conduct allow flexibility patient recruitment . However , absolute difference [ # PVAC patient ] 2x [ # control patient ] exceed 5 give time operator study center</detailed_description>
