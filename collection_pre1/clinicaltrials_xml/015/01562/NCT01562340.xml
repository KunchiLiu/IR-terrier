	<brief_summary>In study , investigator administer pomegranate juice fruit extract target antioxidant therapy hemodialysis patient . The investigator examine whether pomegranate product safe well-tolerated . The investigator also examine whether product may lead improvement blood serum biomarkers : - oxidative stress status - inflammatory status - endothelial dysfunction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomegranate Hemodialysis Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There currently 400,000 patient receive chronic dialysis therapy United States . Cardiovascular infectious disease lead cause death hemodialysis patient , account 50 % all-cause mortality . There complex interaction inflammation , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction contribute cardiovascular infectious risk dialysis patient . Since much evidence increase oxidative stress contributes risk disease dialysis patient , logical hypothesize antioxidant therapy may beneficial reduce risk . In addition vitamin C E , common active antioxidant compound occur naturally food flavonoid . Dietary flavonoid highly bioavailable , show confer antioxidant protection , inhibit platelet activation , exert vasorelaxant effect , reduce inflammation human study . In animal model study , dietary flavonoid show reduce development atherosclerosis . Polyphenols also potent antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral activity . Pomegranate juice rich source potent phenolic antioxidant , demonstrate anti-atherogenic vasorelaxant property . Pomegranate derive polyphenols also demonstrate inhibit platelet activation . Although available data limit , several study suggest dietary phenol may beneficial effect patient undergoing dialysis treatment . These include improvement lipoprotein profile , reduction circulate inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers , reduction infectious complication , improvement inflammatory biomarkers . These observation , though limited , suggest polyphenol base supplementation strategy may effective reduce complication undergoing dialysis treatment . In study , investigator administer pomegranate juice and/or fruit extract target antioxidant therapy . The investigator examine whether pomegranate product safe well-tolerated . The investigator also examine whether product may lead improvement biomarkers oxidative stress status , inflammatory status , endothelial dysfunction hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
