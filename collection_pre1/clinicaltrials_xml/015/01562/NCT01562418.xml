	<brief_summary>Computer settings point number risk factor may induce development Work relate MSD ( WRMSD ) . In light expand use computer increase occurrence Upper Extremity ( UE ) WRMSD among computer operator various intervention program develop test . Nevertheless , many program meet criterion quality level evidence . The main objective study use simultaneously three dimensional ( 3D ) kinematic analysis system , surface electromyography ( SEMG ) fingertip force measurement system ( Flexiforce ) typing , test efficacy primary secondary preventive intervention program aim reduce MSD among computer operator . Work hypothesis : Significant score difference find evaluation parameter research group underwent ergonomic training biofeedback , group without feedback , control group.The evaluated parameter correlate appearance MSD symptom pain affect level function . The study include 66 participant , programmer computer engineer . The participant assign randomly one three group : 1 ) participant receive ergonomic training biofeedback ; 2 ) participant receive ergonomic training without biofeedback ; 3 ) control group , without intervention . Each group consist 22 participant . Treatment efficacy test work motion lab . In lab , 3D kinematic measurement fingertip force relevant type enter standard text measure . At work site , anthropometric measurement , work station measurement , posture observation questionnaire , psychosocial status , function pain level fill The preventive program perform workstation preliminary data collection phase . The program consist one group meeting workplace employee participate study , individual instruction workstation , include 3-6 meeting two research group . Data collect intervention program .</brief_summary>
