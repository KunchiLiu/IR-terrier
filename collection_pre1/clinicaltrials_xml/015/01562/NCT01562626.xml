	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety efficacy investigational drug call APS001F give flucytosine ( 5-FC ) treatment solid tumor . APS001F recombinant Bifidobacterium longum ( live bacteria normally find digestive tract ) modify produce enzyme , cytosine deaminase ( CD ) . The patient first receive injection APS001F follow oral 5-FC . APS001F expect go site tumor ( ) agent produce CD enzyme . CD enzyme convert 5-FC 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) standard chemotherapy drug several type cancer . Additionally , patient also receive 10 % maltose injection , sugar show enhance growth effectiveness APS001F animal . This first study APS001F use human .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients advance and/or metastatic , histologically document solid tumor . 2 . Patients must disease long consider responsive available conventional modality treatment ( fail know standard curative effective therapy disease ) . 3 . Patients must measurable evaluable advanced and/or metastatic disease RECIST 1.1 . 4 . Patients enrol Dose Level 6 high phase I portion trial must least one tumor mass suitable easily accessible excisional biopsy , alternatively , accessible CT ultrasound guide core needle biopsy . The procedure must able perform minimum morbidity . 5 . ECOG Performance status 0 1 . 6 . Must least 18 year age . 7 . Expected survival least 3 month . 8 . Men woman childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , woman must negative serum urine pregnancy test 1 week begin treatment trial . Nursing patient also exclude . 9 . Must able willing give write informed consent . 10 . Patients must adequate major organ function meet follow criterion : white blood cell ( WBC ) count &gt; = 3,000/mm3 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1500/uL . Platelets &gt; = 100,000/mm3 . Hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0g/dL Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 mg/dL . ( estimate creatinine clearance &gt; = 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 mg/dL ; ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 3.0x upper limit normal Prothrombin Time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) &lt; = 1.5x upper limit normal . Oxygen saturation &gt; = 90 % pulse oximetry 11 . Patients body Temperature &lt; = 38.0 degree C. 12 . Echocardiogram demonstrate leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; = 40 % . 1 . Presence history brain metastasis . 2 . Presence know suspect ongoing ischemia nontumor tissue include ischemic peripheral vascular disease , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA , unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) new onset angina ( i.e. , begin within last 3 month ) . cerebrovascular accident , include transient ischemic attack within past 6 month . 3 . An artificial implant easily remove ( e.g. , heart valve , prosthetic hip knee , device ) , could allow nidus infection . 4 . Patients indwell catheter ( Portacath , Hickman PICC line ) 5 . Known cardiac valvular disease ( e.g . bicuspid aortic valve ) arterial aneurysm ( ) may allow nidus infection . 6 . Known cardiac arrhythmia require medication . 7 . Patients follow cardiovascular condition : patent foramen ovale , prior history bacterial endocarditis , exist thrombus ( either arterial venous ) well know history DVT , permanent pacemaker , AICDs , LVADs , intravascular cardiac device , know AV malformation . 8 . Patients baseline respiratory insufficiency severe enough require supplemental oxygen . 9 . Patients pleural effusion abdominal/peritoneal ascites , except find physiological level fluid . 10 . Patients fully recovered toxicity prior treatment cytotoxic drug , radiotherapy anticancer modality ( return baseline status note recent treatment ) . The required minimum time elapse prior treatment : treatment cytotoxic agent , treatment biologic agent within 4 week prior treatment APS001F ( 6 week mitomycin C nitrosoureas ) . treatment molecular target agent within 2 week prior treatment APS001F . radiotherapy within 4 week prior treatment APS001F ( intensive radiotherapy within 6 week palliative radiotherapy within 2 week ) . At least 2 week must elapse prior surgery hormonal therapy . 11 . Presence GI bleeding . 12 . Currently use warfarin . 13 . Active infection kind . 14 . Currently use antibiotic and/or anti fungal agent ( however , topical antibiotic permit ) . 15 . Presence condition concurrent requirement treatment agent know result immune deficiency . 16 . Patients document immunodeficiency HIV infection . 17 . Presence autoimmune disease require corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agent . 18 . Patients evidence chronic active Hepatitis B ( positive HbsAg ) Hepatitis C ( positive viral RNA ) . 19 . Hypersensitivity ( history allergic reaction ) 5FC 5FU 20 . Patient 's medical history contraindicate treatment least one follow antibiotic : ampicillin , clindamycin erythromycin/clarithromycin . 21 . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement . 22 . Presence concurrent illness condition , opinion investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result .</criteria>
