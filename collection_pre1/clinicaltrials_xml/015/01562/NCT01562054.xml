	<brief_summary>The operating room , OR , high-tech complex domain clinician ' possession clinical knowledge good technical skill essential , sufficient . Retrospective study show large proportion mistake occur surgery cause lack clinical skill rather insufficient communication teamwork . Prospective study show insufficient teamwork OR cause high risk complication communication failure surgical team cause procedural error delay . It therefore evident , surgeon surgical team need skill communication , teamwork , decision make leadership ( call non-technical skill ) ensure good outcome surgical patient . Internationally different behavioural marker system develop aid training assessment non-technical skill Non-Technical Skills Surgeons ( NOTSS ) Scotland ( 12 ) . In Denmark certain aspect non-technical skill appear curricula surgical trainee , formal training assessment occur point . The investigator develop behavioural marker system general surgeon adapt Danish cultural organisational context ( NOTSSdk ) . The behavioural marker system consist four category : leadership , situation awareness , decision make communication &amp; teamwork . Each category 3 4 element underpinning element several behavioural example illustrate good poor behaviour . The system need evaluation ensure valid use reliably observe rate surgeon ' intra operative performance . Aim : The aim study examine psychometric property NOTSSdk relation 's construct validity , reliability , usability simulate set . Research question : - What inter rater reliability among raters ? - Are rating consistent expert rating ( = `` gold standard rating '' ) ? - Can one day training session improve novice raters ' agreement ( construct validity ) ? METHODS The study design explore reliability rating make surgeon well examine whether reliability improve train . The study set one day course surgeon ask rate non-technical performance surgeon simulate video scenario . Two distinct set rating obtain . The first beginning day surgeon prior train knowledge rating non-technical skill end day 5 hour train . Sample A sample general surgeon hospital Zeeland , Denmark recruit participate raters head department contact informed project . The investigator wish recruit consultant surgeon ( n=10 ) senior resident surgery ( n=10 ) interest education supervision . Once recruit background information age , gender , position , year surgical experience prior experience assessment others collect . Training rating session The surgeon attend one day course . The course consist three part : first rating session get baseline-ratings participant 6 video scenario , teach training session another rating session 4 new 2 baseline-videos . During first rating session surgeon NOTSSdk rating form allow discus . The second rating session like first addition rating form participant also allow look full NOTSSdk behavioral marker system . The teach include introduction Human Factors non-technical skill surgery , short description development intend use NOTSSdk . The following training allow participant practice rating surgeon ' non-technical skill 4 video record scenario discuss rating . Ratings lead surgeon ' performance obtain category level scenario . Video record 14 simulated video recording make show general surgeon `` act '' role surgery . The scenario script display various scenario routine ( unnoticed prolongation laparoscopic appendectomy ) non-routine situation ( unexpected bleeding open surgery ) . The scenario design specific structure aim specific variation surgeon ' non-technical performance accord four category NOTSSdk .</brief_summary>
