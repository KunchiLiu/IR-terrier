	<brief_title>Prospective Investigation Dynamics ABL Mutations Imatinib Failed CML Patients Treated With Nilotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently treatment strategy Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia undergone groundbreaking change due development new second-generation cancer-targeting drug . After 2001 , seven-year survival leukemia stand much 86 percent due oral therapy cancer-targeting imatinib standard treatment , drug resistance occur patient early stage treatment . It know weakened binding ability imatinib BCR-ABL due point mutation ATP-binding site BCR-ABL . This account 70 percent cause imatinib resistance . According study far , approximately 60 type BCR-ABL point mutation , cause imatinib resistance . The international phase II clinical study dasatinib nilotinib , second-generation cancer-targeting therapy , imatinib fail patient begin 2005 show 70 percent patient achieve complete hematological response ( CHR ) , 50 percent patient , major hematological response ( MHR ) . In study , also observe kinase activation inhibit second-generation cancer-targeting therapy major imatinib-resistant point mutation . With regard peculiar point mutation , V299L , F317L , E25K/V show relative resistance dasatinib , p-loop mutation include G250E , Q252H , Y253F/H E255K/V F359C/V show relative resistance nilotinib . T315I mutation exhibit strong resistance cancer-targeting therapy . Therefore , consider second-generation cancer-targeting therapy show therapeutic effect different domain . According result recent study include one conduct center , assume imatinib resistance cause point mutation patient induces point mutation cause selective increase T315I point mutation treatment second-generation cancer-targeting therapy . However , study far , subject selectively choose advance pharmaceutical company receive approval health authority ABL point mutation follow limited study period , indicate limit accurately observe evaluate dynamic point mutation throughout treatment second-generation cancer-targeting drug . For reason , study design examine ABL point mutation patient Philadelphia chromosome-positive BCR-ABL-positive chronic leukemia treat imatinib , observe dynamic exist point mutation treatment nilotinib , confirm mechanism resistance include expression new point mutation expression pattern long-term follow-up . In addition , study confirm whether expression pattern ABL point mutation associate nilotinib Asian different Western patient .</detailed_description>
