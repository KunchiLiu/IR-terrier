	<brief_title>Investigating Use Fluorescence Imaging Endometrial Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many cancer type , breast cancer melanoma , sentinel node assessment become standard care surgical treatment . Sentinel node first lymph node cancer cell likely spread primary tumor . Removal sentinel node examination accurately predict whether cancer spread node along nodal chain . Fluorescence image ICG dye ( Indocyanine Green ) use detect lymph node patient gastric , colorectal breast cancer . To date , use technique endometrial cancer report .</detailed_description>
