	<brief_title>Patient Response Spinal Manipulation - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In collaboration University Iowa , Palmer Center Chiropractic Research pilot study intend pursue follow specific aim : - Collect preliminary estimate variability effect size identify physiological measure predict patient-centered outcome patient chronic low back pain ; - Collect preliminary estimate variability effect size determine difference spinal manipulation delivery , estimate thrust contact force spinal segment load , relate patient-centered outcome patient chronic low back pain . The specific aim achieve conduct prospective observational study evaluate delivery HVLA-SM use subjective patient self-report objective biomechanical physiological measure . Participants narrowly define chronic low back pain include study . Each participant treat 12 time course 6 week . The following data collect : participant characteristic may predict outcome modifier force use provider ( gender , height , weight , BMI , duration chronic LBP , etc ) ; spinal joint load pre-load thrusting phase ( force moment pre-load phase , peak force moment load rate thrust phase ) ; physiological measure ( spinal stiffness flexion-relaxation ) ; patient report outcome back pain function ; concomitant medication treatment . This study identify association physiological participant self-report outcome test subsequent study . It may also identify potential spinal joint load variation SM delivery contribute clinical improvement could validate future study . Study participant ( n=80 ) recruit Quad Cities metro area . A team experience chiropractic clinician work PCCR treat study participant . Each study participant receive 2 HVLA-SM treatment visit per week 6 week period . The physiological assessment perform immediately SM deliver treatment visit 1 , 5 &amp; 12 ( 6 set assessment total ) . During treatment visit , also capture kinetic measure SM deliver spinal joint load analysis . Participant self-report outcome measure baseline 1 , treatment visit 1 , 5 , 12 . After equipment modify , research clinician train familiarize new set-up . Following test refine data collection protocol pilot study five healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
