The three food test enhance wheat-soy blend ( WSB++ ) develop WFP , locally develop chickpea-based rice-based complementary food supplement . We assess impact feed daily non-fed control , hypothesize child feed food show increased length age Z score ( LAZ ) weight length age Z score ( WLZ ) &gt; 0.21 decreased prevalence stunt waste &gt; 10 % . We expect impact three food equivalent/ non-inferior Plumpy'Doz .</detailed_description>
