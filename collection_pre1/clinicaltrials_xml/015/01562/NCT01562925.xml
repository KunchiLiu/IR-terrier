	<brief_summary>Patients impaired renal function elevate risk development contrast-medium induce acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) . CI-AKI associate increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Effective CI-AKI prevention strategy need . The RenPro-II-WINE Trial design test hypothesis whether moderate red wine consumption prior contrast-medium use effective CI-AKI prevention . Consecutive patient impaired renal function undergo elective coronary angiography assign one four treatment arm : a. control patient receive standard care b. patient receive standard care plus red wine c. patient receive standard care plus white wine d. patient receive standard care plus beer This study give important answer prevent CI-AKI patient impaired renal function undergo contrast medium exposure .</brief_summary>
