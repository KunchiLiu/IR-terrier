	<brief_title>Assessment Mucosal Activity Improve Prognosis Patients With Crohn 's Disease Treated With Immunosuppressants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients prescreened inclusion criterion one week start screen Visit 0 ( Prescreening Visit ) . Patients must stable dos azathioprine/mercaptopurine . Patients give diary record CD symptom seven day prior Visit 1 . At Visit 1 ( Screening Visit 1 ) , patient CDAI score assess base upon diary information . Patients CDAI ≤ 220 calprotectin hsCRP test do . Patients calprotectin &gt; = 250µg/g and/or hsCRP &gt; = 5mg/L notified tell schedule Visit 2 within three week . At Visit 2 ( Screening Visit 2 ) , patient undergo colonoscopy . A Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity ( CDEIS ) use determine endoscopic activity . Patients significant endoscopic lesion notify ask enroll study . Patients randomize study Visit 3 ( Randomization Visit , day Visit 2 result available ) . Due cost invasiveness colonoscopy , Screening Visit 2 colonoscopy serve baseline study , patient enrol . Drug also dispense visit . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either adalimumab placebo treatment period , along continue current immunosuppressive maintenance treatment stable dose . Treatment arm induction 160/80mg maintenance 40 mg every week . Patients return follow visit every 12 week final follow-up visit 48 week ( Visit 7 ) , another colonoscopy perform . Patients terminate early study reason ask return follow-up visit , Visit 7 procedure perform . Before week 48 , patient increase 50 % either calprotectin and/or hsCRP baseline threshold regular visit , follow-up visit perform two week later . If 50 % increase still observe another colonoscopy perform , within two week follow-up visit . If patient still significant endoscopic lesion , study product intensify 40 mg weekly . This include patient placebo order preserve double-blind aspect study .</detailed_description>

Patients receive rectal treatment 1 month inclusion Signs active infection Previous history active untreated inadequately treat tuberculosis ( TB ) latent TB . Patients screen latent TB per local guideline clinical practice country study conduct . Patients latent TB treat standard antimycobacterial therapy ( least 4 week ) initiate biologic therapy negative CRX active TB screening Subjects poorly control medical condition : uncontrolled diabetes document history recurrent infection , unstable ischemic heart disease , moderate severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] class III IV ) , recent cerebrovascular accident , condition , opinion Investigator sponsor , would put subject risk participation protocol Signs colon cancer dysplasia Signs severe unstable renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , respiratory , neurological , psychiatric , hematological disease Signs cancer past five year , except localize treated basal cell skin cancer cervical cancer Patients pregnant nursing Concomitant treatment : Live vaccine . 5ASA compound : Rectal 5ASA discontinue least 4 week study inclusion . Oral 5ASA must stable dose least 4 week study inclusion . If oral 5ASA recently discontinue , 4 week pas study inclusion . Oral corticosteroid ( eg. , Prednisone , budesonide ) discontinue 3 month study inclusion . Antibiotics CD . Only antibiotic use treat concurrent infection allow . Immunomodulators : Patients receive therapy azathioprine/mercaptopurine must stable dose least 12 week inclusion must continue dose study . No treatment know immunomodulators ( eg . methotrexate , 6thioguanine [ 6TG ] , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , sirolimus , ustekinumab , pentoxifylline , mycophenolate mofetil ) experimental drug ( eg. , factor colony stimulate granulocyte macrophage [ GMCSF ] ) within 6 month Monoclonal antibody antiTNF drug . Aspirin Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Treatment aspirin and/or NSAIDS occur 15 consecutive day collect stool sample Calprotectin performing colonoscopy . Screening laboratory analysis show follow abnormal result : Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2 x upper limit reference range ; Total bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL ( 51 μmol/L ) ; Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ( 144 μmol/L ) History drug alcohol abuse past 2 year Receipt study product within 3 month inclusion study Patients employ sponsor relationship dependence sponsor and/or investigator Staff study center Hypersensitivity active substance excipients</criteria>
