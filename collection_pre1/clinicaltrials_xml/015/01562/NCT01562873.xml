	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary - The primary objective two-stage , phase II study estimate objective response rate ruxolitinib patient metastatic unresectable locally advanced breast cancer pStat3+ progress least one line chemotherapy advance disease , and/or recur within 12 month completion neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy . Secondary - To describe toxicity profile - To evaluate clinical benefit rate ( CR + PR + SD &gt; /= 24 week ) - To estimate progression-free overall survival Exploratory - To explore whether baseline hs-CRP level high group median associate objective response - To explore whether baseline IL-6 level high group median associate objective response - To describe hs-CRP level time , describe proportion patient ) hs-CRP &gt; 3mg/L baseline , treatment , time progression , b ) hs-CRP &gt; 1mg/L baseline , treatment , time progression - To describe IL-6 level time , describe proportion patient IL-6 level upper limit normal baseline , treatment , time progression - To describe pStat3 status IHC baseline metastatic biopsy - To describe pStat3 status IHC on-study biopsy - To describe pStat3 status IHC time progression biopsy sample - To characterize archival metastatic biopsy sample use triple immunofluorescence CD44 , CD24 , pStat3 - To characterize archival metastatic biopsy sample use previously characterize pStat3 gene signature - To characterize circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) CD44 , CD24 , pStat3 baseline time progression</detailed_description>
