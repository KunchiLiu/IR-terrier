	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) include cluster dysfunction identifies subject risk develop type-2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . A key feature appear chronic increase inflammation activation innate system . Consequently , increase low-grade inflammation connect adverse effect insulin sensitivity , glucose- lipid metabolism , blood pressure , circulate marker inflammation IL-6 . A grow body evidence also link low-grade inflammation poorer cognitive functioning . Type 2 diabetes , MetS , glucose intolerance increasingly associate impaired cognition . Dietary pattern promote sub-clinical inflammation increasingly consider predictive future risk CVD type-2 diabetes . There grow insight regard role colonic micro flora metabolic regulation development low-grade inflammation obesity . The metabolic cross talk colon peripheral tissue , especially adipose tissue , suggest regulate colonic fermentation indigestible carbohydrate e.g . dietary fibre ( DF ) resistant starch . In addition , epidemiological data show high consumption vegetable fruit associate lowered risk cancer cardiovascular disease , may due high concentration polyphenols anti-oxidants find food . In addition vegetable berry rich dietary fibre potential beneficially modulate gut micro flora may implication metabolic risk factor . In presently describe project hypothesize 5 w daily consumption food product contain berry vegetable improve metabolic risk variable cognitive function . The purpose therefore study potential anti-inflammatory- metabolic effect , prebiotic property , food product base mixture several Swedish berry vegetable know rich dietary fibre , polyphenols anti-oxidants . In addition purpose investigate effect cognitive function food product .</detailed_description>
