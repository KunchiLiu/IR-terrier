	<brief_title>Safety Study Fluconazole Combination With Flucytosine Treatment Early Cryptococcal Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently wide variation practice little evidence guide treatment early cryptococcal infection HIV-infected individual advanced immunosuppression . However , epidemiologic study suggest may promise novel approach decrease mortality due cryptococcal meningitis ( CM ) , second lead cause death among HIV-infected individual many resource-limited setting . Screening asymptomatic HIV-infected individual advance immunosuppression serum cryptococcal antigen ( CrAg ) clearly identify population high risk CM death feasible screen method resource-limited setting . However , screen serum CrAg alone without additional diagnostic study identify heterogeneous clinical population early cryptococcal infection , many already sub-clinical meningeal infection fungemia . The mainstay anti-cryptococcal therapy resource-limited setting oral fluconazole though preliminary evidence suggest effective treatment . Thus , critical need potent therapy ( 1 ) safely administer resource-limited setting ( 2 ) effective heterogeneous population HIV-infected individual advance immunosuppression early cryptococcal infection initiate anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) . This single center , open-label , randomized Phase IIb study conduct assess safety estimate efficacy oral fluconazole combination flucytosine treatment early cryptococcal infection . The study base two site support Family AIDS Care Education Services ( FACES ) Western Kenya . A consecutive sample 100 HIV-infected adult CD4 cell count ≤100 cells/µl serum CrAg titer ≥1:2 sign symptom severe , systemic cryptococcal infection enrol . At enrollment , specimens participant culture evidence Cryptococcus neoformans . Individuals meet inclusion exclusion criterion consent participate study randomize combination therapy oral fluconazole ( 1200mg/day ) plus flucytosine ( 100mg/kg/day ) fluconazole alone fourteen day therapy . Subsequently group receive anti-retroviral therapy well fluconazole 800mg/day 8 week follow 200mg/day . The primary safety endpoint incidence treatment-related adverse event serious adverse event . The primary efficacy endpoint survival 12 week . In addition , offer additional diagnostic test aim 50 % participation , approximately 25 individual arm . We perform battery diagnostic test include chest radiography , fungal culture blood , sputum , urine , stool cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , cryptococcal antigen test CSF , gram stain , Ziehls-Nielsen stain India Ink stain CSF sediment . Anti-fungal susceptibility test via broth microdilution polymerase chain reaction serotyping mat type analysis perform clinical isolates .</detailed_description>
