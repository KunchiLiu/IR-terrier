	<detailed_description>Overview Of Study Design This prospective , multicenter phase II trial design evaluate safety activity panobinostat patient relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Study design The trial conduct accord optimal two-stage design Simon alpha 0.05 beta 0.10 , consider follow two hypothesis : first response rate ( RR ) less 10 % interest ; second , RR 30 % clinically meaningful . In initial stage , 18 patient enter onto study . If less 3 response ( £ 2 18 ) observe , trial would terminate . Otherwise , accrual continue total maximum 35 patient . At end trial , 6 few response occur among 35 patient ( £ 6 35 ) , conclude regimen worthy investigation group patient . The treatment divide three phase : induction phase ( course 1 6 ) , consolidation phase ( course 7 12 ) , maintenance phase ( course 13 end therapy reason ) . Study duration This study expect start February 2011 . The last patient expect enrolled end January 2013 . Considering possible treatment duration 24 month , trial due complete January 2015 . Objectives : Primary objective 1 . To explore antitumor activity panobinostat term overall response ( OR ) end induction phase ( i.e . month 6 begin panobinostat ) Secondary objectives 1 . To explore antitumor activity panobinostat term Complete Response ( CR ) 2 . To assess time response ( TTR ) 3 . To evaluate Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) 4 . To assess safety tolerability panobinostat 5 . To evaluate Overall Survival ( OS ) Exploratory objectives 1 . To study impact pharmacogenetics predict response panobinostat 2 . To study impact immunohistochemical pattern patient 's specific gene expression response panobinostat 3 . To assess correlation `` telomeric asset '' response panobinostat</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient age ≥ 18 year 2 . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 3 . Patient history DLBCL accord WHO classification 4 . Patient progressive disease receive least CHOPR CHOPR like first line regimen , standard second line therapy ( DHAP , ESHAP , ICE similar salvage regimen ) inclusive ASCT 5 . Patient progressive disease receive least CHOPR CHOPR like first line regimen consider eligible intensive salvage therapy include ASCT age , comorbidities , impossibility perform ASCT 6 . Patient undergoes baseline new lymphnode pathologic tissue biopsy confirmation diagnosis biologic study ; bone marrow biopsy adequate purpose perform stag . Patients primary refractoriness , eligible intensive salvage therapy include ASCT , perform previous biopsy store frozen material 6 month less enrolment study repeat new biopsy 7 . Patient least one site measurable nodal disease baseline ≥ 2.0 cm long transverse diameter determine CT scan ( MRI allow CT scan perform ) . Note : Patients bone marrow involvement eligible , criterion alone use disease measurement 8 .
