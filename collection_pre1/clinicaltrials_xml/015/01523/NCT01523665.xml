	<brief_summary>Glucose metabolism impair many critically ill patient often aggravated parenteral feeding , infection and/or pre-existent diabetes.Therefore insulin infusion protocol , base frequent bedside glucose monitoring , implement critical care unit . Despite extensive effort intensive care unit staff difficulty experience achieve efficient safe glucose control . Several barrier implementation glycemic control identify . Most importantly , concern increase frequency severe hypoglycemic episode . To overcome problem Space GlucoseControl develop decision support system help achieve safe reliable blood glucose control desire range ( 4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l 4.4 - 8.3 mmol/l ) . The objective non-interventional study gain additional information performance Space GlucoseControl system glycaemic control ICU patient use routine clinical practice .</brief_summary>
