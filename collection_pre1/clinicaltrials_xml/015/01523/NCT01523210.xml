	<brief_summary>Intramuscular application botulinum toxin ( BoNT ) use successful therapy muscle spasticity . Clinical practice show , even use special guidance technique increase accuracy target , BoNT may spread adjacent site diffusion . This cause fluctuate treatment response , unintended side effect , decrease effect due production antibody . Hence , clinicians require increase efficacy safety dose reduction , improvement injection technique , additional treatment strategy . Referring , animal model show increased efficacy decrease systemic side effect BoNT inject muscle active passive manipulation muscle . The mechanism effect remain unclear . T2 ( Diffusion Tensor Imaging ) DTI technique evaluate in-vivo distribution fluid human skeletal muscle . In addition , allow differentiate denervated muscle tissue , cause BoNT injection , surround unaffected muscle tissue . Up investigator knowledge , neither human , vivo measurement influence passive muscle activity area denervation , primary , in-vivo distribution BoNT within spastic human muscle tissue , evaluate . The aim explorative study : - monitor inflow regional distribution injection bolus dynamic T2-weighted- , DTI-sequences ; - ass effect passive muscle exercise area denervated , cause BoNT , measure DTI- , T2-weighted flair sequence . The investigator hypothesize , - intramuscular denervation area , measure DTI- , T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery ( FLAIR ) sequence , 3 week routine BoNT injection , facilitate passive muscle exercise ; - primary distribution inject BoNT bolus non-invasively monitored dynamic T2- , DTI- T2 weight sequence . Therefore , investigator blind , cross-over study , 6 patient suffer upper limb spasticity , include musculus biceps brachii , investigate . ( Magnetic Resonance Tomography ) MRI musculus biceps brachii perform two consecutive , routine BoNT-injection day ( baseline week 16 ) . Patients receive dosage clinically indicate , due routine treatment . Patients randomise receive thirty minute physiotherapy affected arm , include exercise elbow flexor , one injection day ( baseline , week 16 , respectively ) . In addition , MRI repeat 3 week injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- At baseline week 16 , dynamic T2- , T2- , DTI weight sequence perform monitor injection BoNT-bolus . Immediate MRI-scan , physiotherapy perform . Patients , randomise non-treatment group baseline , receive physiotherapy immediately MRI week 16 . - At week 3 week 19 , three week BoNT injection , respectively , MRI repeat . T2-and DTI- weighted FLAIR- sequence perform .</detailed_description>
