	<brief_summary>The propose test intend enable dentist differentiate cavitated non-cavitated tooth decay area teeth contact ( interproximal surface ) . In area , dentist visually inspect caries , currently bitewing X-rays ( BWs ) correctly detect presence enamel decay 15-25 % time . This low sensitivity lead late treatment result unnecessarily large filling , crown , pain , root canal , possible later loss teeth . Hypothesis : Use radiographic contrast teeth increase accuracy detection early cavitation 58 % 90 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tooth site record tooth number , type surface ( mesial , distal , occlusal ) , cavitated , non-cavitated , healthy . Radiographs similarly scored.Although contrast agent classify drug study drug property effect cell since property agent already well know safety record well establish . This study record radiopacity contrast agent healthy tooth surface , non-cavitated tooth surface cavitated tooth surface . The outcome surface type presence absence radiopacity radiograph make one visit study subject . The radiograph contain data intervention ( placement contrast agent ) outcome assess week later completion data collection .</detailed_description>
