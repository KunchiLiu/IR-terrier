	<brief_summary>This randomize , prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial use mitomycin-C topical application adjunctive treatment endoscopic surgical treatment patient laryngotracheal stenosis . We hypothesize use mitomycin-C improves patient outcome endoscopic surgical treatment laryngotracheal stenosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Mitomycin-C Application Laryngotracheal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstruction upper airway cause laryngotracheal stenosis ( LTS ) often result severe morbidity even mortality . Treatment LTS continue present challenge wide array surgical technique employ . Despite multiple endoscopic and/or open reconstructive procedure , patient often experience restenosis result abnormal wound-healing process initially instigate airway obstruction . The high rate stenosis relapse therefore motivate researcher find new method modulate control wound-healing process airway . Although adjuvant treatment steroid antibiotic investigate LTS , much attention recent year turn use topical mitomycin-C ( MMC ) . As topical application , MMC show inhibit fibroblast proliferation wound-healing process . The use MMC treatment airway stenosis first report 1998 routinely use endoscopic management LTS . However , despite numerous animal human study , benefit MMC LTS patient remain questionable . While previously publish retrospective data suggest addition MMC improve outcome , prospective study directly address efficacy MMC endoscopic LTS surgery . This study first randomize , prospective , double-blind , placebo control clinical trial design investigate efficacy MMC adjunctive therapy endoscopic surgical treatment patient LTS . In addition , study investigate relationship patient symptom objective pulmonary function measurement . Ultimately , result study may influence treatment evaluation patient laryngotracheal stenosis .</detailed_description>
