	<brief_summary>Computed tomography ( CT ) scan become essential early diagnostic phase trauma care high diagnostic accuracy . The introduction multi-slice CT scanners infrastructural improvement make 'total body ' CT scanning ( TBCT ) technically feasible usage currently become common practice several trauma center . However , literature provide limited evidence whether immediate 'total body ' CT scan lead well clinical outcome conventional radiographic imaging supplement selective CT scan trauma patient . The aim REACT-2 trial determine value immediate TBCT scan trauma patient . The investigator hypothesize immediate 'total body ' CT scan primary survey severely injured trauma patient positive effect patient outcome compare standard conventional ATLS base radiological imaging supplement selective CT scanning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Randomized Study Early Assessment CT Scanning Severely Injured Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries cause 5.8 million death annually account almost 10 % global mortality . Among adult age 15-59 year proportion injury cause death even high , range 22 % 29 % [ 1 ] . Specialized trauma center world provide initial trauma care diagnostic work-up trauma patient . This work-up standardize frequently base Advanced Trauma Life Support ( ATLS ) guideline include fast priority-based physical examination well screen radiograph supplement selective Computed Tomography scanning ( CT ) . ATLS guideline advise routinely perform X-rays thorax pelvis Focused Assessment Sonography Trauma ( FAST ) trauma patient . Whether perform CT scan follow conventional image define less clearly ATLS guideline depend upon national guideline local protocol . In recent year CT scan become faster , detailed available acute trauma care set . CT show high accuracy wide range injury reflect low missed diagnosis rate . Hence , conventional radiological work-up accord ATLS may optimal choice primary diagnostics anymore . Furthermore , severely injured patient frequently require secondary CT scan many part body conventional imaging . Modern multidetector CT scanner ( MDCT ) perform image head , cervical spine , chest , abdomen pelvis single examination ( 'total body ' CT scan ) . The past year 'total body ' image concept gain popularity possible alternative conventional imaging strategy . With use immediate 'total body ' CT ( TBCT ) scan trauma patient , rapid detailed information organ tissue injury become available well-founded plan therapy make . In past , CT scanner locate radiology department , frequently even another floor emergency department ( ED ) trauma patient admit . The past assumption TBCT severely injure trauma patient time consume may longer hold , since increase number trauma center CT scanner available ED even trauma room . Several study evaluate time interval associate TBCT usage severely injured patient . Although study incomparable respect design , CT scanner use , diagnostic work-up protocol trauma population , main conclusion clear . TBCT scan trauma patient time consume expect may even time save compare conventional imaging protocol supplement selective CT. More trauma center encourage implement immediate TBCT scan diagnostic phase primary trauma care . Since burden TBCT term cost radiation dose least controversial , advantage perform immediate TBCT proven high quality study result high level evidence order make implementation justifiable . In order ass value immediate TBCT scan severely injured trauma patient , Academic Medical Center ( AMC ) Amsterdam , Netherlands , initiate international multicenter randomize clinical trial . Severely injured patient , think benefit 'total body ' image concept , include .</detailed_description>
