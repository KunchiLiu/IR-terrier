	<brief_summary>Physicians seek method ass neuromuscular disease non-invasive quantifiable . Many patient tolerate standard current day assessment tool ( needle electromyogram ) , Electrical Impedance Myography ( EIM ) potential serve non-invasive , quantifiable , diagnostic tool neuromuscular disease . If successful , device allow improve ability diagnose neuromuscular disease assess disease progression remission , allow good care individual patient well use clinical trial , improve outcome measure neuromuscular disease seek .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DART Electrical Impedance Myography ( EIM ) Trial Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subject subject DMD screen Visit 1 . Screening evaluation establish eligibility include medical history , abbreviate physical examination , vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , pulse , respiration ) , weight . Eligible subject provide assent , stipulate Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) requirement , parent/guardian sign inform consent , subject consider enrolled . Subjects enrol 4 study cohort total approximately 90 subject . Allocation cohort plan due consideration regard effect age outcome . Visit 2 , Study Assessments , may take place day Visit 1 screen evaluation . If subject complete study assessment day , subject may return complete Visit 2 evaluation within approximately 24 hour end Visit 1 . Visit 2 assessment include morphological test muscle length girth , skin fat measurement , Clinical Assessments ( 6-Minute Walk Test [ 6MWT ] , North Star Ambulatory Assessment , time function test , dynamometry ) , 3 phase Device Performance test . Phase 1 Device Performance test do 2 trained raters ( Rater A Rater B ) research site , designate perform Device Performance test subject respective site . At least 10 minute completion first assessment , Phase 2 Device Performance test repeat Rater A . Upon completion Phase 2 Device Performance testing , subject proceed Clinical Assessments perform physical therapist . Following Clinical Assessments , Phase 3 Device Performance test perform Rater B .</detailed_description>
