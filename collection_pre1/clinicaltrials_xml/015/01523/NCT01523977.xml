	<brief_summary>Laboratory study suggest , study drug , Everolimus ( RAD001 ) , may prevent tumor cell growth also may increase efficacy chemotherapy drug . Everolimus approve use United States certain type cancer , kidney cancer . It extensively study people various type cancer single agent ( drug use alone treat cancer ) combination number drug . Studies adult cancer also evaluate Everolimus combination anti-tumor drug . Information lab study clinical trial suggest Everolimus may kill leukemia cell , also make likely steroid ( prednisone ) able kill leukemia cell . In research study , look learn Everolimus work combination drug commonly use treat relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( prednisone , vincristine , PEG-asparaginase , doxorubicin ) . The main goal study evaluate side effect treatment combination order determine safe dose Everolimus give 4 drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : The study treatment last 32 day time take study drug Everolimus daily 32 day addition standard chemotherapy drug . Below list study drug well drug receive treat leukemia research study . Chemotherapy drug : 1 . Everolimus ( RAD001 ) : By mouth Daily 1-32 2 . Prednisone : By mouth vein Three time daily day 4-32 3 . Vincristine : In vein Daily day 4 , 11 , 18 , 25 4 . Doxorubicin : In vein Once per day day 4 5 . A drug call dexrazoxane give dose Doxorubicin protect heart damage might cause Doxorubicin . 5 . PEG-asparaginase : In vein Once per day day 5 18 If allergy PEG-asparaginase , give another form asparaginase ( Erwinia asparaginase ) . Four dos Erwinia asparaginase give muscle twice week begin Day 5 another 4 dos give muscle twice week begin Day 15 place schedule dose PEG-asparaginase . In addition medication list , also receive intrathecal ( IT ) chemotherapy give directly spinal fluid treat leukemia may spread brain spinal fluid . The medicine give spinal fluid list . The number time give chemotherapy spinal fluid depend whether see leukemia cell spinal fluid sample take first day study . 1 . Cytarabine Day 1 ( also Day 4 see leukemia cell spinal fluid screen spinal tap ) 2 . Triple intrathecal therapy ( cytarabine , methotrexate hydrocortisone ) Days 18 32 ( see leukemia cell spinal fluid screen spinal tap ) , Days 11 , 18 , 25 32 ( see leukemia cell spinal fluid screen spinal tap ) A drug call leucovorin give mouth vein dose triple intrathecal therapy . Leucovorin give prevent mouth sore might occur get methotrexate spinal fluid . Leucovorin give three time day 24 hour begin one day receive dose triple intrathecal therapy . Portions treatment `` routine '' `` standard '' way treat recurrent ALL . Receiving vincristine , prednisone , PEG asparaginase doxorubicin along chemotherapy spinal fluid standard treatment relapse leukemia . The research part treatment involve give Everolimus time drug . Clinical Lab Exams : During study , physical examination ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . You also blood work check side effect organs study drug chemotherapy drug . Bone marrow study do end 32-day treatment period ass respond treatment . If remission , special minimal residual disease ( MRD ) test also perform marrow sample part study .</detailed_description>
