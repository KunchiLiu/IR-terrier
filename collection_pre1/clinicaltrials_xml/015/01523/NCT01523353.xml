	<brief_summary>Each year UK around 1500 patient undergo surgery bowel cancer spread liver . This major surgery offer chance cure , associate complication . Fitter patient less likely serious complication . We interest find whether short exercise program improve patient fitness surgery whether reduce surgical complication . We plan measure fitness patient go liver surgery . We give exercise programme 4 week , assess fitness . We also interest whether fitter people better Liver function . To assess take small sample liver tissue operation laboratory analysis function . Hypothesis 1 . A short period exercise significantly improve fitness prior liver surgery 2 . Greater Fitness associate good liver function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prehabilitation Liver Surgery Introduction Thirty per cent patient colorectal cancer metastatic disease time presentation , 20 % develop liver metastases primary colorectal malignancy resect . Liver resection offer prospect cure proportion patient , increase use effective neo-adjuvant chemotherapy , proportion increase . However , liver surgery associate significant morbidity mortality may higher patient comorbidity , poor cardiorespiratory fitness receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) non-invasive assessment cardiovascular pulmonary function , quantify measure anaerobic threshold ( AT ) VO2peak . The anaerobic threshold measure sustainable exercise , VO2peak measure maximal exercise capacity . The AT assess different surgical group show useful predictor postoperative complication survival . Early work demonstrate short period preoperative exercise intervention improve AT VO2peak . However , work date undertaken patient prior liver surgery . Hepatic glucose metabolism provide much energy requirement postoperative period . Work demonstrate exercise training increase hepatic glucose production , inhibition mark effect endurance capability . This may particularly relevant surgical resection involve resection 80 % hepatic tissue . However , link hepatic gluconeogenic capacity fitness assess cardiopulmonary exercise test establish . A demonstrable link gluconeogenic capacity cardiopulmonary fitness explanation underpin physiology would help explain systemic effect drug hepatotoxicity . It would also allow development strategy improve gluconeogenic capacity may reduce complication improve tolerance many hepatoxic agent chemotherapy . Hypothesis 1 . A short exercise program significantly improve CPET define anaerobic threshold prior liver surgery cancer population associate reduce post-operative morbidity mortality . 2 . Hepatic gluconeogenic capacity associate cardiopulmonary fitness . 3 . Gluconeogenic capacity associate mitochondrial number quantity enzymes integral gluconeogenesis PEPCK Methods Patients colorectal liver metastasis suitable hepatic resection undergo baseline CPET randomise either preoperative exercise intervention standard care . Patients within intervention arm undergo 4 week exercise program consist 3 interval session per week stationary bike . This individually tailor accord initial exercise test . In week prior surgery patient undergo CPET . At surgery liver tissue take determine hepatic gluconeogenic capacity . CPET test perform possible patient 6 week 3 month follow surgery . Post-operative complication ( Clavien classification Postoperative morbidity score ( POMS ) ) 30 90-day mortality record . Quality life assessment ( EORTC/SF-36 ) take recruitment , week prior surgery , 6 week surgery 3 month follow surgery . Laboratory Analysis Hepatic gluconeogenic capacity assess direct analysis fresh slice hepatic tissue take time surgery . Slices take use Krumdiek MD6000 tissue slicer . These weigh incubated buffer contain lactate . Glucose measure use Glucose Oxidase assay , calculate per mg wet weight hepatic tissue . Further analysis mitochondrial number ATP production , enzymatic level conduct follow initial result . Statistical consideration This study continuous response variable match pair study subject need 38 patient detect true difference 1.5ml/min/kg , probability 0.8 Type I error 0.05 ) . Anticipated recruitment period 10 month assume dropout rate 20 % . Randomisation computerise block randomisation , patient stratify receipt neo-adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
