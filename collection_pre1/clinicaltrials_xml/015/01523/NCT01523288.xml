	<brief_title>The Intestinal Function People With Prader-Willi Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) congenital genetical disease characterize moderate retardation , food-seeking behavior serious risk develop health threaten overweight , low stature , abnormal body composition lack growth- sex-hormones . They live independent life reliant help care personnel . People PWS react abnormally signals body . E.g . reduce sense pain lack urge urination despite full bladder . Most patient also relatively slow pulse , consistent dysfunction nervous system ( parasympathetic nervous system ) also large significance bladder- bowel function . The Intestinal function people PWS sparse describe subject , systematically examine scientific context . We therefore want examine whether bowel function people PWS different bowel function healthy people . The subject elucidate medical examination , questionnaire , registration toilet habit , measurement rectal diameter ultrasound scan measurement colonic transit time . The result compare finding normal healthy people . Because normal material exists rectal diameter measure ultrasound , establish one . The result project increase knowledge possible bowel dysfunction constipation , people PWS immediately lead improve care optimized treatment patient .</detailed_description>
