	<brief_summary>Delayed cord clamp least 30 second neonates 37 week show infant higher circulate blood volume first 24 hour , less need blood transfusion , less incidence intraventricular hemorrhage . Delayed umbilical cord clamping also show increase initial hematocrit decrease need red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion compare intervention infant bear 27 33 week ' gestation . However , delay cord clamp 30-45 second may theoretically interfere neonatal resuscitation . There study address active milking cord effect neonatal resuscitation . Active milk umbilical cord towards baby prior clamp ( rather passive ) take less 5 second perform interfere neonatal resuscitation . Umbilical cord milking , alternative delay cord clamping , show increase circulatory blood volume express hemoglobin value . Active milking cord prior clamping , however , consider standard care 1 Japanese randomize control study report umbilical cord milking reduces need RBC transfusion , thus reduce number infant require RBC transfusion compare control condition . Our study aim test hypothesis active milk umbilical cord reduce need transfusion preterm infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose design randomize controlled trial . Pregnant woman risk deliver singleton preterm infant 24 28 week gestation randomize prior delivery one two treatment arm . Common reason need deliver early gestational age include limit : preterm labor respond tocolytic medication , incompetent cervix cervical dilation contraction , clinical chorioamnionitis require delivery maternal/fetal benefit , severe preeclampsia , severe growth restriction non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing . The first arm include active milk umbilical cord toward neonate 's umbilicus prior cord clamp delivery second arm include intervention respective cord immediately clamp usual fashion post delivery ( control ) .</detailed_description>
