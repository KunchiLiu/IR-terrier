	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability single ascending dos Vasomera ( PB1046 ) administer subcutaneously adult subject Stage 1 Stage 2 essential hypertension . The secondary objective study characterize pharmacokinetic profile single ascending dos Vasomera relationship serum concentration Vasomera change systolic diastolic blood pressure measure : - Mean change baseline 24-hour systolic diastolic blood pressure measure ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) compare placebo . - Identification minimum maximum decrease systolic diastolic blood pressure measure ABPM . - Mean change baseline cuff systolic diastolic blood pressure compare placebo . - Effect Vasomera pulse pressure heart rate . An additional secondary objective study characterize immunogenicity profile Vasomera follow single subcutaneous dose .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willing able sign write informed consent follow study relate procedure . Males females age 18 70 year age inclusive . Male female subject childbearing potential must willing able practice effective contraception study , willing able continue contraception 1 month last dose study drug . Diagnosis essential hypertension : Has systolic blood pressure 140169 mmHg ( 130169 mmHg subject type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) ) diastolic blood pressure 90109 mmHg ( 85 109 subject T2DM ) currently antihypertensive therapy . Has take two antihypertensive agent control blood pressure opinion investigator could safely withdraw antihypertensive therapy . BMI ≥ 20 ≤ 40 kg/m2 The difference ( high low mean value ) mean seat systolic blood pressure ( triplicate measurement 12 minute interval ) measure three separate occasion Day 4 Day 0 ( predose ) within 14 mmHg diastolic within 8 mmHg . Judged Investigator generally stable health ( except hypertension ) define absence clinically significant laboratory abnormality , vital sign , ECG find clinically significant underlying disease would put subject risk participation study , would interfere interpretation study result ( i.e. , secondary hypertension ) . Receiving stable dos protocol permit concomitant medication 1 month prior study drug administration anticipate dose adjustment study period . Screening ( triplicate sit read 12 minute apart ) BP &gt; 169 mmHg ( systolic ) &gt; 109 mmHg ( diastolic ) . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 130 mmHg &gt; 169 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg &gt; 109 mmHg randomization ( Day 1 ) prior first dose study drug ( Day 0 ) Unstable/underlying cardiovascular disease define protocol . Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus define hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9.0 % Clinically significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction Screening baseline ( Day 4 ) define protocol . Use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( exclude prophylactic use low dose aspirin 81 162 mg ) within 2 week prior administration study drug anticipate use study period . Pregnant lactating female . Known latex allergy ( Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor [ ABPM ] unit contain latex bladder tube ) . Known history active drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior Screening and/or positive drug screen detection alcohol Screening baseline ( Day 4 ) . Positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody . Participation study receive investigational drug device within 30 day prior Screening visit take part nondrug study opinion Investigator would interfere outcome study . Major surgery , donate lose &gt; = 1 unit blood ( approximately 500 mL ) within 1 month prior randomization ( Day 1 ) display evidence volume depletion ( i.e. , postural hypotension ) otherwise explain subject 's antihypertensive medication regimen . Other medical psychiatric condition opinion Investigator would place subject increase risk , would preclude obtain voluntary consent , would interfere interpretation result study .</criteria>
