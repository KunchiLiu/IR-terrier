	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine potential carbon monoxide ( CO ) decrease elevate blood pressure pulmonary artery . This symptom see patient pulmonary arterial hypertension , rare disease cause fatigue , dizziness , shortness breath blood vessel supply lung narrow , force heart work harder push blood . Previous study laboratory show carbon monoxide promise treating symptom . Subjects study ask undergo new type treatment improve pulmonary arterial hypertension breathe CO gas . CO colorless , tasteless , odorless gas usually find car exhaust cigarette smoke . It administer continuous flow air . Subjects undergo screen process determine eligible study . After screen process , subject meet eligibility criterion study , begin carbon monoxide treatment cushion mask place nose mouth . This treatment last sixteen week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon Monoxide Therapy Severe Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) remain uncommon debilitate fatal disease , clinically mark progressive increase pulmonary vascular resistance lead right heart failure ultimately death . Currently treatment option available suffer PAH target cellular dysfunction lead constriction vasculature . Although evidence available therapy secondary effect vascular remodel currently therapy target abnormal cell proliferation PAH . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) gaseous molecule know toxicity lethality live organism expose high concentration sustain period . However , CO show promise preclinical model pulmonary hypertension . Recent study show mammalian cell ability generate endogenous CO primarily catalysis heme heme oxygenase enzymatic system ample evidence demonstrate CO behaves signal molecule cellular biological process . Furthermore , CO demonstrate exert key physiological protective function various model tissue inflammation injury . This study evaluate safety potential efficacy inhale CO subject severe PAH . Over forty subject severe PAH despite best available therapy screen UIC pulmonary vascular disease clinic , twenty subject recruit participation trial . The trial consist initial screening period determine subject ' eligibility study . This base previous echocardiogram , six minute walk test right heart catheterization do part standard care subject pulmonary arterial hypertension . Following initial screening , trial last sixteen week , subject receive inhale carbon monoxide three time weekly University Illinois Chicago .</detailed_description>
