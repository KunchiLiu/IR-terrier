	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose alpha 1 anti-trypsin ( alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human ) see well work treat patient acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human may better treatment graft-versus-host disease cause stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha 1 Anti-Trypsin Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability alpha 1 anti-trypsin ( AAT ) patient steroid non-responsive acute GVHD . II . Characterize pharmacodynamic effect AAT pro-inflammatory cytokine , heparan sulfate , spectrum peripheral blood T cell . III . Determine clinical response GVHD AAT patient steroid non-responsive acute GVHD . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor human follow phase II study . Patients receive alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Patients experience toxicity GVHD stable improve day 7 dose continue therapy alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human day 9 , 11 , 13 15 .</detailed_description>
