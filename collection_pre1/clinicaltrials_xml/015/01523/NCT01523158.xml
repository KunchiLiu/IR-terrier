The exact immune mechanism underlie symptomatic improvement entirely clear . Dr Tarzi , Professor Frew Professor Kern recently develop new method investigation immune response allergens . These method require relatively small blood sample may provide useful information immunotherapy exert effect . In addition improve investigator basic understanding treatment , knowledge may drive improvement treatment could useful monitor patient response . The investigator study propose investigate change immune response pollen allergen immunotherapy . Blood take prior first immunotherapy injection prior final injection .
