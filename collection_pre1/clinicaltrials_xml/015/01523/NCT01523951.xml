	<brief_summary>Aim study demonstrate superiority continuous cool skin topical EMLA placebo reduce burn pain application capsaicin 8 % patch ( `` Qutenza '' ) . Secondary test , 2 different pre-treatments effect application pain within first 24 hour , different pre-treatments effect reduction epidermal nerve fiber density ( ENFD ) 1 week Qutenza application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Local Anaesthesia Cooling During Capsaicin 8 % Patch Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According literature , one common adverse event capsaicin 8 % patch burning pain reversible erythema application site . In general recommend apply topical anesthetic one hour capsaicin 8 % patch application , treat pain cooling , NSAIDs even opioids . Nevertheless , still limit data available effect side-effects . In study shall test cool skin 5-10 Celsius , immediately Qutenza apply , continue cool whole application time , result reliable prevention burn pain compare pretreatment topical anesthesia apply one hour advance . This would lead assumption application pain predominantly cause decrease threshold heat pain beyond skin temperature therefore prevent lower skin temperature . By ascertain pain 24 hour capsaicin 8 % patch application epidermal nerve fiber density ( ENFD ) 1 week capsaicin 8 % patch application shall prove different pretreatment method change secondary effect capsaicin application . If result turn positive , would massive relief regard time management rescue medication .</detailed_description>
