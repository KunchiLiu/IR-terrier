	<brief_summary>The finding gastric dysplasia associate macroscopic lesion ( DNAML ) follow-up dysplasia endoscopic resection ( DAER ) challenge dilemma . In last year , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) become recognize tool treatment dysplastic Barrett 's esophagus , use gastric dysplasia yet study . The investigator aim study efficacy , safety tolerability RFA treatment dysplastic gastric mucosa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Treatment Gastric Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer fourth common cancer second lead cause cancer relate death worldwide . The 10-year survival patient malignancy 20 % due advanced disease time diagnosis . Screening program country high incidence gastric neoplasia aim detect early stage cancer , suitable curative treatment . Well-differentiated dysplastic gastric lesion limit mucosa ( non-ulcerated ulcerate less 3 cm ) limit superficial submucosa ( le 3 cm lymphatic vascular invasion ) negligible risk lymph node metastasis suitable endoscopic curative treatment . Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) increasingly use set promising result . However , even advance technique , en bloc R0 resection possible 13-15 % 16-26 % case , respectively . The presence dysplasia endoscopic resection ( DAER ) post-resection scar present challenge dilemma due technical difficulty , associate complication , perform subsequent EMR/ESD fibrotic tissue . Another issue concern presence gastric dysplasia associate macroscopic lesion ( DNAML ) . In case , target endoscopic treatment difficult clinical management standardize . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) increasingly advocate treatment dysplastic Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) , use gastric dysplasia yet test . The investigator aim study role gastric RFA treatment DNAML DAER .</detailed_description>
