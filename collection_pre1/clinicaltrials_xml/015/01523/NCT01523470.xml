	<brief_summary>The investigator design pilot randomise , single-centred , controlled trial compare different withdrawal method Non-invasive ventilation . Our study aim compare stepwise withdrawal Non-invasive ventilation versus immediate withdrawal Non-invasive ventilation . The primary endpoint compare rate success two withdrawal method . The investigator define success recurrence acute hypercapnic respiratory failure restitution Non-invasive ventilation within 48 hour NIV stop . The secondary endpoint include time recurrence acute hypercapnic respiratory failure measure time randomisation , total day Non-invasive ventilation use day hospitalisation . Results trial inform design future randomise trial area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Withdrawal Non-invasive Ventilation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients With Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient would receive standard medical treatment inhaled bronchodilator , systemic steroid , antibiotic accord local bacteriology . Acute NIV initiate trained respiratory nurse accord standardised protocol . The nurse would bedside initial acclimatization . BIPAP vision use provide bi-level pressure support ventilation . Interfacing different type nasal full-mask would individualise . NIV use many possible first day , least 20 hr . Throughout NIV treatment , follow parameter monitor NIV start : arterial blood gas , respiratory rate , heart rate blood pressure , mental state , pulse oximetry . If patient fail respond NIV , would intubate appropriate . Criteria failure include lack clinical improvement increase dyspnea deterioration blood gas , hemodynamic instability , uncontrolled ventricular arrythmia , development hypercapnic coma cardiopulmonary arrest . A patient would consider suitable withdraw ventilator fulfil criterion rest .</detailed_description>
