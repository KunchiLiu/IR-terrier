	<detailed_description>Adenocarcinoma esophago-gastric junction ( AEG ) represent aggressive disease poor prognosis . Surgery traditional mainstay treatment patient present locally advanced disease , define transmural invasion without lymph node involvement . Surgical approach may differ , principal achieve wide mural clearance , negative margin , perform adequate lymphadenectomy . Although surgery primary modality cure patient , majority patient reveal recurrence lead death within 2 year resection . The incidence locoregional relapse series phase II phase III trial range 25 % 60 % , 20-30 % patient evidence distant metastasis . Median survival surgery alone localized disease remain poor , range 13 19 month 5-year survival rate best approximately 40 % . To improve long-term outcome patient esophageal gastric cancer combine modality therapy concept investigate many year . The experience combine modality therapy adenocarcinoma esophago-gastric junction extrapolate study esophageal gastric cancer , investigate population involve part patient AEG . The eminent drawback majority commonly cite randomized trial heterogenicity cancer patient population . Most overlap esophageal adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma esophagus , esophagogastric junction stomach . When investigator review composition prominent 10 study population include 3171 patient easophageal gastric cancer investigator identify 911 ( 28.7 % ) patient AEG . The remain pooled population involve 1173 ( 36.9 % ) patient adenocarcinoma esophagus , 598 ( 18.9 % ) patient squamous cell carcinoma esophagus 775 ( 24.4 % ) patient adenocarcinoma stomach . Only 1 randomize control trial concern exclusively patient AEG . In study preoperative chemoradiotherapy result 16 % increase 3-year survival . Although superiority proven ( p=0.07 ) , data provide evidence preoperative chemoradiotherapy may improve survival investigate . Interestingly , survival benefit evident although postoperative mortality double ( 10.2 % versus 3.8 % ) add chemotherapy . Although study meet accrual goal could provide statistical significance , improvement local cancer free overall survival suggest preoperative chemoradiotherapy appear valuable modality treatment cure patient localize AEG . As evident major response preoperative treatment important prognostic factor future trial aim optimize preoperative treatment combine treatment modality . All mention discrepancy regard optimal treatment AEG bring investigator idea design study test safety efficacy three-phase combine modality therapy accommodate induction taxane-based triple chemotherapy follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy 45Gy total dose irradiation subsequent surgical resection homogenous population patient clearly define AEG . Taking account result recent phase II III trial propose combined modality regimen suggest substantial response neoadjuvant therapy promise highly effective loco-regional cancer clearance moderate acceptable tolerance despite complex extensive treatment .</detailed_description>
