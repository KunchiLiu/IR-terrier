	<brief_summary>The 24-hour-a-day , 7-day week , work-world arrive within lifetime , stay . Americans work , frequently multiple job . The pattern short sleep week follow attempt recover weekend common practice , know little associated health risk . What cost term increase know risk marker cardiovascular disease , repeat night insufficient sleep , cost compound repetition , without adequate recovery ? Evidence accumulate suggest short sleep duration link development metabolic inflammation-associated disease , cardiovascular disease . Mechanisms involve development cardiovascular disease include impaired vascular function inflammation . The current proposal design investigate effect repeat period short nocturnal sleep duration 4 cycle ( cycle consist 3 night 4 hour sleep opportunity per night ) , cycle short sleep follow single night recovery sleep . Vascular reactivity assess use brachial artery flow mediate dilation , microcirculatory vasodilation assess use perfusion image technique . The dependence IL-6 sVCAM-1 measure peripheral circulation , vascular function , also investigate .</brief_summary>
