	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) two disease often coexist call overlap syndrome ( OS ) . Compared single OSAS , OS patient susceptible serious hypoxia hypercapnia especially sleep , much likely result pulmonary hypertension cor-pulmonal . With flexible expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) , auto-trilevel ventilation may superior fix bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) ventilation remove residual obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea event correct hypercapnia simultaneously . The overall purpose study compare curative effect fix BiPAP auto-trilevel ventilation OS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auto-trilevel Ventilator Patients With Overlap Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The contradiction treatment overlap syndrome improve hypercapnia narrow difference inspiratory positive airway pressure ( IPAP ) expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) , meanwhile eliminate apnea popnea event may easily occur end expiration For ordinary Bipap ventilator . If IPAP set high , patient may feel discomfort , pressure difference IPAP EPAP narrow expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) high , hypercapnia may occur . If EPAP low , redusual apnea hypopnea event may become common . Auto-trilevel ventilation , low airway pressure begin expiration prevent hypercapnia high airway pressure end expiration prevent residual apnea event , able provide novel ventilation mode higher efficacy lower average airway pressure overlap syndrome . To prove hypothesis , comparison make ordinary BiPAP auto-Trilevel ventilation mode treatment patient overlap syndrome . In study , investigator compare change relate index include apnea hypopnea index、minimal pulse oxygen saturation、arousal index , sleep quality , PaCO2 sleepiness score ) treatment . Meanwhile , curative effect compare BiPAP auto-Trilevel ventilation mode . The investigator analyze change confirm hypothesis .</detailed_description>
