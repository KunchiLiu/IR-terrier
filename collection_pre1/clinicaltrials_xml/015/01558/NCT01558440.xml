	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : During rehabilitation phase management severe acute malnourish Bangladeshi infant less 6 month old , rate weight gain significantly child feed F-100 dilute F-100 compare fed infant formula . Brief summary : Until recently , severe malnutrition relatively rare infant young 6 month , urbanization HIV/AIDS pandemic fear incidence severe malnutrition among young infant rise . The question best feed infant age &lt; 6 month thus come forefront . Given lack publish evidence regard advantageous formulation feed severely malnourish infant age &lt; 6 month , need observational study comparative randomize trial alternative formulation guide decision optimum dietary management age group . This area aptly consider research priority consultation meeting expert world convene World Health Organization management severe malnutrition September 2004 . In WHO case-management guideline severe malnutrition , separate provision young infant ( infant less 6 month old ) . The guideline suggest use low-solute formula ( F-75 ) continue breastfeed initial stabilisation phase . In rehabilitation phase , guideline advise F-100 energy density 100kcal/100ml promote catch-up growth . There concern renal solute load use F-100 high young infant , group start use dilute F-100 energy density 75 kcal/100 ml . Another related issue contribution breastfeed dietary intake rehabilitation . In severely malnourished infant , breast milk intake likely low initially appetite poor , may substantial infant recovers . Uncertainty breast milk intake lead conflict opinion advice , wean breast providing sufficient energy ( 1 ) . The aim study , conduct carefully supervise Nutrition Rehabilitation Unit ( NRU ) , compare three recovery diet ( Infant formula , F-100 dilute F-100 ) order provide evidence-base determine change add-on term diet WHO guideline need . It also measure potential renal solute load ( mosmol/l ) , serum electrolyte plasma osmolality child . Body composition infant also measure use stable isotope dilution technique intervention diet provide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Malnourished Infants With F-100 Diluted F-100</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This randomize controlled trial comparing three recovery diet conduct Nutrition Rehabilitation Unit ( NRU ) . Duration study : 24 month . Study site : The trial take place Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , Bangladesh . This hospital high case load , peak April-October , WHO guideline management severely malnourish child minor modification follow . Diarrhoea entry point patient attend hospital include child . Methods During stabilization phase acute phase management , child feed every 2 hourly 130ml/kg/day F-75 along necessary management accord WHO guideline ( 8 ) . Judgment regard suitability transfer rehabilitation phase make regular doctor longer-stay ward accord set criterion : ) return appetite ( i.e . hungry , easily finish fee ) , ii ) naso-gastric feeding require , iii ) absent insignificant oedema , iv ) cessation vomit , v ) less 3 watery stools/day , vi ) clinical sign infection . When ready rehabilitation phase , eligible child transfer NRU randomize receive three diet ( Infant formula , F-100 dilute F-100 ) . For first 2 day test diet , feed 130ml/kg/day 12 ( 2-hourly ) feed 10ml feed leave . This equivalent transition phase WHO guideline . During 2 day infant ' pulse respiration rate monitor 3 hourly find sign possible fluid overload . Thereafter feed 3 hour interval . Infants feed trained research personnel encourage eat full . Being 'full ' define two successive refusal fee re-offered . Water freely available feed . Breastfed child continue breastfed . Pulse respiration rate temperature monitor every 8 hour . If , infant show sign fluid overload , transfer longer-stay special care ward manage accord standardized management protocol practice Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B . All child accompany mother counsel professional breastfeeding counsellor relactation child already wean breast . Measurement diet : All feed episode take place supervision study personnel . Food portion weigh serve use electronic balance one-gram precision , actual amount consume calculated subtracting leftover food amount offer . Pre-weighed napkin provide ; food regurgitate , vomit spilled swabbed , weigh subtracted amount offer . Measurement breast milk intake : If , particular child breastfed re-lactation establish , mother request breastfeed day night , accord usual feeding pattern home prior study child demand . At nursing , breast milk offer child refuse intake , amount consume measure test-weighing nursing , ensure child wear clothe weigh . Each nursing episode initiate take post-feeding weight consider new episode , intake similarly measure . Breast milk intake measure record difference child 's weight feed , use electronic balance two-gram precision , weight change adjust child-specific insensible loss , measure balance least 30 minute day . The duration episode breast-feeding measure use stopwatch , duration frequency breastfeed 24 hour also record . Discharge criterion : Body weight gain 15 % admission bodyweight soon infant becomes oedema free child oedema free weight-for-length Z-score ≥ 2 . Follow-up : At time discharge , mother/caregiver ask bring his/her child nutritional follow-up unit 2 week , monthly 3 month . In every visit child measure weight , height mid-upper arm circumference also examine possible illness ( ) . If , child fails come schedule follow-up , study personnel visit respective home know well-being status subject . Deuterium Oxide Dilution Technique Assessment Body composition : The following procedure assessment body composition conduct day infant transfer NRU repeat time discharge . Deuterium oxide ( 2H2O ) use body composition assessment . Upon enrolment , baseline saliva sample collect . After collection baseline saliva sample 5g deuterium oxide label water fed study infant . Children avoid drinking water equilibration period , i.e. , 3-4 hour ingestion stable isotope dose . According recommendation International atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) field manual ( 9 ) , two post-dose saliva sample collect 3rd 4th hour . The concentration deuterium oxide saliva sample measure Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer ( FTIR ) total body water ( TBW ) estimation . Afterward measure TBW , amount fat free mass ( FFM ) estimate . Body fat mass ( FM ) difference body weight fat free mass ( 10 ) . Therefore child , saliva sample collect 6 time ( 2 baseline 4 post dose ) course NRU stay . Calculation body composition : The dilution space 2H ( VD ) 4.1 % high TBW due exchange H non-aqueous H body TBW ( kg ) = VD /1.041 Where , VD ( kg ) = Dose 2H2O ( mg ) /enrichment 2H saliva ( mg/kg ) FFM ( kg ) = TBW ( kg ) / hydration coefficient* - Hydration factor = Hydration FFM ( % FFM ) /100 Fat mass ( FM ) calculate difference body weight FFM FM ( kg ) = body weight ( kg ) - FFM ( kg ) Results often express % body weight FM ( % ) = FM ( kg ) / body weight ( kg ) x 100 - Please see Table 2 ; Hydration factor child ( 11 , 12 ) Randomization After assess suitable initiate rehabilitation phase , infant randomize test diet block 6 use random number table ( EPI-INFO 6.04 , CDC Atlanta , GA ) . Allocation conceal seal envelope . The code keep secure break data analysis complete . Medical nursing staff child 's carers blind formula give . Infant formula , F-100 dilute F-100 similar much possible appearance prepared dietician . The invitation participate research give admission randomization . Data collection 1 . Rate weight gain ( g/kg/day ) : Body weight measured daily digital scale , precision 2g . Calculation weight gain ( 13,14,15 ) : Weight gain g/kg.day = ( W2 - W1 ) x 1000/ ( W1 x number day W1 W2 ) Where : - W1 = low weight NRW stay kg ( usually 1st day NRW-weight case marasmic child , may vary case oedematous child ) - W2 = weight kg day calculation 2 . Intake ( kcal/kg/day ) : During stay NRU , amount test diet offer eaten , water consume , record research assistant . 3 . Renal solute load ( mOsmol/l ) : Potential renal solute load : PRSL = N/28 + Na + C1 + K + Pa Where , N= Nitrogen content diet ( mg/28=mosm ) Na= Sodium content diet ( mg/23=mosm ) Cl= Sodium content diet ( mg/35=mosm ) K= Potassium content diet ( mg/39=mosm ) Pa= Available Phosphorous content diet ( mg/31=mosm ) 0.9 mOsm PRSL retain per gram weight gain ( 4 ) . RSL , therefore , estimate use equation : RSL est = PRSL - ( 0.9 x gain ) Where : RSL est PRSL express mOsmoles per day gain weight gain gram per day ( 7 ) . 4 . Serum sodium plasma osmolality : Two ml blood take antecubital vein child day 1 , 3 , 7 measure serum sodium , potassium , chloride , total carbon dioxide , creatinine osmolality . This allow monitoring osmolar state child i.e . hypernatremia . Spot urine sample mention day check specific gravity osmolality/creatinine ratio . Urine collect paediatric urine collector bag . Standard method use measure electrolyte , creatinine , osmolality specific gravity Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory ICDDR , B . 5 . Extra-renal water loss : Loss body fluid due diarrhoea vomit record , fever , environmental temperature humidity . Outcome measure : 1 . Rate weight gain ( g/kg/day ) 2 . Food Intake ( kcal/kg/day ) 3 . Breast milk intake ( child breastfed ) ( g/kg/d ) ( kcal/kg/d ) 4 . Renal solute load ( mOsmol/l ) : Sample size estimation : In NRU Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B , 124 child suffer SAM manage infant formula along recommended WHO-guidelines daily mean ± SD weight gain 10.25 ± 6.7 g/kg/day . If , assume F-100 dilute F-100 rate weight gain 15 g/kg/d , require 40 child group 80 % power 5 % level significance . If , investigator consider 10 % attrition group require 44 infant . So , investigator study 44 infant group give total 132 child three study group . data Analysis : All record form pre-coded checked daily completeness consistency . Differences among group assess use chi-squared test proportion analysis variance ( ANOVA ) normally-distributed continuous variable . Paired t-test paired comparison intervention perform . The analysis intention-to-treat basis . Statistical analysis Statistical Package Social Sciences , version 11.5 Windows ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Ill ) . Subgroup analyse conduct test age differential effect renal solute load among group .</detailed_description>
