	<brief_summary>Depressed patient offer experimental treatment new , potentially fast-acting antidepressant call ketamine scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure chemical effect drug . Ketamine give dose 0.0 ( placebo ) , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 mg/kg . If patient respond ketamine first infusion , may s/he received ketamine placebo dose ketamine low . In case , optional second scan infusion active ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) offer . This second scan occur later week first scan/infusion ( schedule permit ) . There guarantee patient respond second ketamine infusion . Patients enrol study eligible 6 month treatment study psychiatrist ketamine infusion ( ) . Healthy Volunteers : Healthy control receive infusion ketamine single dose ( 0.5 mg/kg ) . Volunteers receive one MRI scan infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine Treatment Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common illness , affect 14 million American adult year . MDD lead cause disability worldwide , responsible huge workplace healthcare cost . The several week delay onset treatment improvement MDD symptom currently available treatment increase burden disorder . Shortening delay major unmet challenge treatment MDD . Studies report single intravenous low dose drug call ketamine bring substantial improvement depression hour , even patient improve antidepressant treatment . Certain aspects ketamine 's drug action fairly well understood , question remain property relate antidepressant effect . Our preliminary data support rapid antidepressant benefit ketamine . The investigator use scanner measure effect ketamine two major brain chemical transmitter find cause significant increase ( 60 % ) glutamate ( Glu ) gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) level front brain . The investigator hypothesize increase Glu GABA level , responsible antidepressant action medication . Knowing ketamine work could help develop good medication use orally used maintenance improvement see ketamine . The objective propose dose find study examine relationship ketamine-induced improvement MDD Glu GABA responses ketamine compare Glu GABA responses ketamine MDD healthy subject well understand pathophysiology MDD . To achieve aim investigator propose randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind study several different dos ketamine . The investigator conduct MRI scan measure Glu GABA ketamine treatment .</detailed_description>
