	<detailed_description>This study hypotheses test arise work do group evaluate brain cortical change people chronic back pain . These study demonstrate loss 1.5 cc neocortical gray matter per year living condition , include gray matter lose due aging . Since original publication , ten study replicate basic result , show distinct chronic pain condition associate specific brain anatomical reorganization , characterize regional decrease grey matter density . Recently , study show chronic pain completely reverse , anatomical change seem least partially reverse within time span 4-12 month , provide evidence time window reversal grey matter abnormalities A fundamental question arises recent study extent reversibility brain atrophy associate chronic pain follow continuous use pain-relieving drug . Apkarian 's lab generate strong evidence brain anatomy subject osteoarthritis ( OA ) dramatically different healthy subject . Given recent data show hip replacement OA reverse brain atrophy , investigator hypothesize great confidence effective analgesic also reverse least brain atrophy observe OA . Thus , study patient chronic knee OA treat duloxetine provide unique opportunity answer question . Since OA patient study single new agent four month , one directly examine effect treatment relation progression regression brain atrophy . One also examine whether placebo , think reflect attentional motivational state , affect change atrophy , , extent . The investigator consider brain atrophy chronic pain overall marker extent nervous system reorganization subject develop live condition . Animal model various chronic pain condition repeatedly provide evidence idea , show , example , dramatic change way pain process periphery , spinal cord , level individual neuron . The investigator presume change one contribute atrophy human chronic pain . However , underlie mechanism remain uncovered . In addition , human suffer chronic pain exhibit large number cognitive emotional deficit . The investigator presume deficit directly relate brain atrophy discover chronic pain condition . Unfortunately , direct study link brain regional atrophy cognitive ability chronic pain , although preliminary study underway Apkarian 's lab . Thus , addition answer previous question , present study also allow u investigate extent reverse atrophy corresponds reverse plasticity multiple level nervous system , well whether reversal also correspond improvement cognitive emotional ability .</detailed_description>
