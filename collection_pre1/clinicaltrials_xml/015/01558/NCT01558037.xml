	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) common infection 60-90 % adult worldwide evidence infection sometime life . Patients undergone transplantation risk develop CMV , especially patient antibody CMV pre-transplant , receive organ recipient antibody CMV . Usually disease CMV cause mild sometimes patient even aware infection without test detect virus . CMV le commonly cause serious infection affect many part body include intestine , liver , lung . In rare case CMV infection transplant patient cause death . All patient receive transplant monitor CMV infection . The purpose study determine way investigator determine advance patient great risk CMV infection . Specifically , study analyze immune system transplant patient determine specific element immune system 1 ) help protect body CMV infection , 2 ) help body combat CMV infect . Identifying specific element immune system could improve physician 's ability monitor SOT patient CMV infection , help treat CMV patient become infected .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis degree CMV cell-mediated immune ( CMI ) response correlate inversely risk development CMV replication correlate response initial therapy risk relapse onset replication . The primary aim study determine association CMV CMI response risk CMV infection degree initial CMV viremia rate viremia clearance standard CMV therapy . The first secondary aim determine association CMV QnPCR , CMV microRNA expression , TLR2 expression , CMV-specific CMI risk relapse CMV disease initial treatment . The second secondary aim determine association CMV QnPCR , CMV microRNA expression , TLR2 expression , CMV-specific CMI collect CMV infection follow prospective data : Development CMV end organ disease , resolution symptom CMV infection , non-CMV infection initial CMV infection , graft rejection , recurrent resistant CMV infection , marker immune function . The third secondary aim determine association CMV QnPCR , CMV microRNA expression , TLR2 expression , CMV-specific CMI response collect CMV infection solid-organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients follow retrospective data : Type SOT , CMV donor/recipient status , type degree immunosuppression , type length CMV prophylaxis , prior graft rejection infection ( non-CMV ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Main Study Subjects recruit list SOT ( liver , liverkidney , kidney , kidneypancreas , cardiac ) . At time transplant , consent patient immediate pretransplant blood draw baseline labs subsequent lab drawn donor/recipient CMV serostatus CMV D+/R ( maximum 50 subject ) D+/R+ D/R+ ( maximum 50 subject ) . Subjects must ≥ 18 year age , consentable , agree laboratory clinical followup Northwestern . CMV Replication Substudy Subjects recruit undergone SOT , find positive CMV QnPCR ( &gt; 600 copies/mL ) subsequently treat CMV infection either intravenous ganciclovir oral valganciclovir therapy discretion treat provider . Subjects must ≥ 18 year age , able give consent , agree laboratory clinical followup Northwestern . Subjects exclude previous history CMV infection SOT prior enrollment ( prior episode CMV infection replication prior onset current episode ) . Subjects also exclude subject give inform consent subject able comply followup test and/or treatment .</criteria>
