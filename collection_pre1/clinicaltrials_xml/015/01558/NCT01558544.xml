	<detailed_description>Procedure : The patient undergo preoperative sonographic assessment ovary determine either ovary diseased compromise . Patient undergo preoperative blood sample measure AMH , FSH , LH estradiol indicator current ovarian function ( le 8 teaspoon ) time allow assessment ovarian reserve appropriate ; menopausal level FSH ( â‰¥ 30 miu/ml ) contraindication participation study . The patient may infectious disease test part evaluation fertility preservation treatment . Patient undergo preoperative assessment clearance surgery anesthesiologist . Intraoperative management include laparotomy laparoscopy , depend individual patient 's history , exam oncology plan . Removal one ovaries depend preoperative ovarian assessment recommendation oncologist . If ovarian survival anticipate treatment never document ovary remove . Both ovary may also remove diseased condition require prophylactic oophorectomy prevent risk malignant transformation , e.g . 46 XX/46 XY chimera BRCA mutation carrier . If ovarian function rarely document anticipated treatment one ovary remove one may leave situ reposition avoid field radiation . The decision leave ovary situ reposition make pre-operatively physician performing surgery consultation patient radiation oncologist . If normal ovarian tissue , determine pathology , take biopsy ovarian tissue exceed 50 % ovarian volume contra-lateral side freezing . Additionally , remain ovary may reposition suture posterior wall uterus pelvic brim radio-opaque clip place identify ovary shield irradiation . Ovarian tissue remove treated follow : ( ) cortex strip remain ovarian tissue outer layer contain immature egg primordial follicle . The cortex section 8mm x 1mm strip , frozen vial contain 1-3 strip . One strip send pathology paraffin embed available future assessment occult lymphoma cell marker ; ( b ) central medullary portion frozen separately potential scientific analysis since section would clinical utility . The amount tissue frozen may vary depend part whether one two ovary remove . At point future , thaw ovarian tissue , either vitro maturation autologous transplantation pelvis area body could perform . The patient would receive routine postoperative care . The patient 's oncologist consult regard proper timing surgery need special intraoperative postoperative management However , since survival primordial follicle transplant ovarian tissue quite low ( &lt; 10 % ) , method vivo maturation egg improve method transplantation need develop . One two vial tissue ( &lt; 10 % tissue frozen ) thaw develop technique mature oocyte . This may include transplantation tissue animal model vivo maturation . Six month 1 year follow surgery and/or treatment medical condition , eg chemotherapy , hormone test perform evaluation ovarian reserve . This may include AMH FSH hormone level well pelvic ultrasound dominant antra follicle count . If subject wish utilize ovarian tissue clinical use , option include discard cryopreserved ovarian tissue donate cryopreserved tissue approve research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females 045 year age premenopausal Treatment plan likely result premature menopause premature ovarian failure This include patient receive : Cancer treatment abdominal pelvic irradiation and/or high dose chemotherapy Surgery require removal ovary medical condition disease , e.g . Prophylactic oophorectomy BRCA patient Patient unable unwilling pursue fertility preservation freeze oocyte embryos . Previous treatment cancer acceptable patient still ovarian function Patient medically stable enough undergo surgery ( cleared anesthesia ) Patients meet criteria Patients receive medical clearance physician undergo surgery Patients already experience menopause .</criteria>
