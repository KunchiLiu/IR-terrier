	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , open label , non-randomized , phase I/II-study define safety efficacy BRL combination relapsed/refractory patient recommend safe efficacious dose future phase II/III study . Hypothesis : The simultaneous administration BRL relapse CLL feasible , safe efficient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Trial Combination Bendamustine , Rituximab Lenalidomide Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As mechanism action lenalidomide seem work rather immunomodulation direct anti-proliferative activity CLL cell . Lenalidomide stimulate T- NK-cells , modulate tumour microenvironment CLL inhibit bone marrow angiogenesis . There rationale combine lenalidomide alpha-CD20 mAb rituximab lenalidomide enhance NK cell mediate antibody dependent cytotoxicity rituximab treat NHL cell . On hand , increase evidence combination chemotherapy ( FC ) rituximab result high response rate longest progression-free survival treatment naive relapse CLL . Besides FCR combination bendamustine , hybrid alkylating agent property purine-analogue , rituximab ( BR ) seem active relapse treatment-naive CLL base result phase II trial GCLLSG . Preliminary result lenalidomide show promising response rate 32 % include high risk patient . Thus , combination BRL could improve therapeutic activity high risk CLL combine two immunomodulatory classic cytotoxic principle .</detailed_description>
