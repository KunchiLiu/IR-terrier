	<detailed_description>Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) chronic devastate skin disorder affect area rich apocrine gland . Nodules appear affect area ; progressively become swollen rupture release pu . This process occur repeatedly leading sinus tract formation scar . This disease course create frustrating situation patient also physician . Traditional treatment comprise short-courses antibiotic surgical excision . However , relapse rule HS lead severe impairment quality life . The Dermatology Quality Life Index ( DQLI ) HS 8.9 high skin disorder . This devastate disorder often neglect consider rare situation . However , HS seem indiscriminately affect global population . Although exact epidemiology largely unknown , point-prevalence report range 1 % 4 % . A recent large epidemiological survey France report 0.97 % disease prevalence . The exact pathophysiology HS unknown . Smoking , dietary habit genetic predisposition link HS . However , recent survey group 56 patient , disclose severe derangement monocyte function subsequent antigen processing patient . The percentage natural killer ( NK ) cell increase CD4-lymphocytes decrease compare healthy control probably imply existence autoimmune predilection disorder . We previously demonstrate defective lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced production pro-inflammatory cytokine , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) interleukin ( IL ) -6 blood monocyte patient HS . As consequence , hypothesis implication autoimmune autoinflammatory mechanism pathogenesis HS start create last year . The hypothesis reinforce positive result administration TNF antagonists prospective study limit number patient one conduct study group . Subcutaneous treatment 50mg etanercept weekly 12 week 10 patient , reduce patient ' suffering , attenuate local sign inflammation retard disease relapse . Anakinra recombinant interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) . Anakinra block biologic activity naturally occur IL-1 , include inflammation cartilage degradation associate rheumatoid arthritis , competitively inhibit bind IL-1 interleukin-1 type receptor , express many tissue organ . IL-1 produce response inflammatory stimulus mediate various physiologic response , include inflammatory immunologic reaction . The biological property anakinra exist clinical laboratory data favor derangement immune response HS , prompt investigate whether anakinra would efficient management patient HS .</detailed_description>
