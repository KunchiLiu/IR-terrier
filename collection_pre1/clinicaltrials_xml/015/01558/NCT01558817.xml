Recent work find in-hospital CPR perform often death unchanging survival few CPR survivor discharge home , thus suggest CPR increasingly perform without benefit burden ineffective treatment increase . Unlike medical procedure , CPR become default provided patient even tremendously poor outcome . It time change paradigm CPR . Through compare innovative `` informed assent '' approach toward in-hospital CPR ( inform patient underlie chronic illness make outcomes CPR poor CPR perform allow disagree ) versus usual care group chronically ill patient reduce life expectancy , investigator aspire demonstrate CPR delivery reduce . And addition DNR status increase , preserve patient quality life decrease burden ineffective treatment patient family . If effective , informed assent intervention potential revolutionize investigator discuss CPR investigator chronically ill patient .</brief_summary>
