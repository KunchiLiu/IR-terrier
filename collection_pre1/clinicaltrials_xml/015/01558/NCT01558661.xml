	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , new treatment call axitinib patient adenoid cystic carcinoma . This type cancer study call phase II study . Axitinib oral medication interfere cancer cell growth reduce growth blood vessel around tumor . This study help find axitinib useful drug treat patient adenoid cystic carcinoma . Axitinib experimental drug yet approve Food Drug Administration use adenoid cystic carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must MSKCC pathologically confirm adenoid cystic carcinoma . Cancers arise nonsalivary gland primary site allow . Patients must locally advance and/or recurrent and/or metastatic disease amenable potentially curative surgery radiotherapy . At least 2 week must elapse since end prior systemic treatment ( 4 week bevacizumab contain regimen ) , radiotherapy , surgical procedure resolution treatmentrelated toxicity NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 ( tolerable grade 2 ) back baseline except alopecia hypothyroidism . Patients must RECIST v1.1 measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must documentation new progressive lesion radiologic image study perform within 6 month prior study enrollment ( progression disease interval allow ) and/or new/worsening disease relate symptom . Note : This assessment perform treat investigator . Evidence progression RECIST criterion require . Patients must archival tissue primary tumor metastasis available correlative study . Either paraffin block twenty unstained slide contain 5μm section acceptable . If twenty slide available , less amount may acceptable discussion study Principal Investigator , Dr. Alan L. Ho . Male female , age &gt; = 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; = 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; = 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000 cells/mm3 platelet &gt; = 75,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0 g/dL AST ALT &lt; = 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless liver metastasis case AST ALT &lt; 5.0 x ULN Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 ml/min Urinary protein &lt; 2+ urine dipstick . If dipstick &gt; = 2+ 24hour urine collection do patient may enter urinary protein &lt; 2 g per 24 hour . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation , 6 month discontinue study treatment . Major surgery &lt; 2 week radiation therapy &lt; 2 week start study treatment . Gastrointestinal abnormality include : inability take oral medication ; malabsorption syndrome . Current use anticipate need treatment drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( i.e. , grapefruit juice , verapamil , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , telithromycin , clarithromycin , indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , lopinavir , atazanavir , amprenavir , fosamprenavir delavirdine ) Current use anticipate need treatment drug know CYP3A4 CYP1A2 inducer ( i.e. , carbamazepine , dexamethasone , felbamate , omeprazole , phenobarbital , phenytoin , amobarbital , nevirapine , primidone , rifabutin , rifampin , St. John 's wort ) Requirement anticoagulant therapy oral vitamin K antagonists . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance patency central venous access devise prevention deep venous thrombosis allow . Therapeutic use low molecular weight heparin allow . Active seizure disorder evidence brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability receive study treatment . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack 6 month deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol . Female patient pregnant lactating . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
