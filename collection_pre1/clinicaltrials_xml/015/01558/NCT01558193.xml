	<brief_summary>There series well design study report , history anti-social behavior , supplementation vitamin / mineral , omega-3 fatty acid ( n-3 FA ) , , reduce incidence aggressive behavior . Although evidence nutrient role , date relative contribution fatty acid vitamin / mineral consider : example possibility synergistic interaction yet examine . In addition topic date study real-life condition , prison , make topic difficult study . The major aim present study develop paradigm would allow study topic sample general population without history anti-social behavior . Subjects receive either vitamin/mineral supplement , fatty acid supplement , neither three month , Measures impulsivity aggression assess supplementation . Although past measure actual behaviour prove sensitive supplementation , questionnaire measure . The second major objective therefore consider whether phenomenon study sample without history anti-social behavior , use standardize , sensitive laboratory base measure compare questionnaire measure .</brief_summary>
