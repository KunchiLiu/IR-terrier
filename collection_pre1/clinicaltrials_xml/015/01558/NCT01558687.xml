	<brief_summary>The main purpose clinical trial find cilengitide effect brain tumor cell also particularly blood vessel supply tumor nutrient oxygen patient newly diagnose non-resectable ( inoperable ) glioblastoma . In addition , clinical trial investigate addition cilengitide combination standard treatment prolongs life patient non-resectable glioblastoma . Similarly , duration response cancer treatment side effect therapy analyze . Furthermore , additional data body deal substance collect ( call pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis ) . In clinical trial investigator would also like learn disease response experimental medication measure certain `` marker '' . This image trial investigate biological effect cilengitide monotherapy tumor microvascular function tumor viability homogenous non-pretreated subject population newly diagnose Gliobastoma ( GBM ) . The purpose clinical trial study effect cilengitide may certain marker cancer tumor and/or blood learn disease-related marker could help predict subject respond administration cilengitide . The investigator anticipate approximately 30 subject participate clinical trial . The clinical trial conduct approximately 4 medical center follow country : Germany , Poland , Switzerland . The investigator anticipate clinical trial last end 2013 . Your participation trial may last 86 week .</brief_summary>
