	<brief_title>Longitudinal Changes Exercise Capacity Children Young Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although burden sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) affect individual significant , study examine influence SCA measure physical function exercise capacity . Moreover , physiologic basis poor physical functioning child SCA unknown study extensively . The purpose proposal use cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) gain comprehensive understanding longitudinal change exercise capacity , effect poor exercise capacity quality life child young adult SCA . The specific aim project : 1 ) Measure peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , reference standard exercise capacity , child young adult SCA classify primary pathophysiologic contributor decrease exercise capacity , 2 ) compare result exercise test result previously complete exercise test determine longitudinal change exercise capacity . These aim perform 60 subject SCA 30 match control participate previous study , IRB # 2009-13659 ; `` The Physiologic Assessment Exercise Capacity Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia '' . In secondary analysis , also study participant quality life use set validated questionnaire . This study essential address several area exercise capacity , include longterm effect physiologic contributor exercise limitation , remain fundamental knowledge gap SCA .</detailed_description>
