	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) give inhaled mist patient lung metastasis . The safety drug use administration also study . IL-2 protein trigger white blood cell , call natural killer cell T-cells , kill cancer cell . When give shot vein , IL-2 know cause fever flu-like side effect , include rash , fatigue , extra fluid skin lung . These symptom less IL-2 inhaled mist body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level IL-2 base join study . Up 8 dose level IL-2 test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose IL-2 found . Study Drug Administration : You take IL-2 daily Days 1-21 28-day cycle . You take IL-2 Days 22-28 . You teach clinic prepare drug home . To take IL-2 , breathe drug mist mouthpiece nebulizer machine , provide . You tell use machine . You bring machine study visit . Each day take IL-2 , write date day study cycle . You also measure record heart rate level oxygen blood . You provide pulse oximeter measure oxygen level . Each day study , use small hand-held device test lung function answer question side effect may . You measure lung function blow hard 5-7 second device . The device also prompt answer question side effect may . The device send information MD Anderson use internet connection . This described detail , show use device . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : -Before first dose , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect test immune function . On Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record . - Blood ( ½ teaspoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 8 15 Cycle 2 beyond : - Your medical history record . - Blood ( ½ teaspoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 22 Cycle 2 beyond : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw may include pregnancy test able become pregnant . You may urine test able become pregnant . - You lung function test . - The amount oxygen blood measure pulse oximeter . - You CT scan x-ray chest . - Before first dose , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect test immune function . Your local doctor may draw blood may contact phone side effect medical history . The study team explain arrange , possible . You return clinic start new cycle , receive study drug supply next cycle . End Treatment Visit : Within 14 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine tests.This routine blood draw may include pregnancy test able become pregnant . You may urine test able become pregnant . - You lung function test . - The amount oxygen blood measure pulse oximeter . - You CT scan x-ray chest . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis advance cancer lung metastasis . Patients prior therapy eligible know superior alternative medical therapy . For phase Ib expansion cohort diagnosis osteosarcoma lung metastasis require . 2 . Willing comply protocol therapy require safety monitoring ( self report , pulse oximetry , remote spirometry , lab ) 3 . Adequate organ function define : renal creatinine &lt; /=2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , hepatic bilirubin AST , &lt; /=5x ULN ; pulmonary : FVC &gt; /=50 % predict , O2 sit rest &gt; /=90 % ( supplementary oxygen ) 4 . Age &gt; /=12 &lt; /=50 5 . Performance status : ECOG performance status &lt; /=1 age &gt; /= 16 Lansky play &gt; /= 80 % age &lt; /= 15 6 . Patients must recover &lt; /= grade 1 toxicity ( except alopecia hear loss ) prior chemotherapy , investigational therapy , hormonal , biological , targeted agent . 7 . No radiotherapy within 2 week : Exception : patient may receive palliative low dose radiotherapy ( 30 Gy less ) lesion outside lung discretion treat physician . Palliative radiotherapy could give aerosol treatment start necessary . 8 . Subjects able read understand English . 9 . Patients advance cancer resectable lung metastasis . 10 . Patients sarcoma , renal cell carcinoma , melanoma know disease outside lung and/or thorax . 1 . Currently treat bronchodilator corticosteroid . 2 . Females : pregnant breast feed child bear potential ( e.g . female childbearing age amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month surgically sterilize ) willing use effective contraception 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , bradycardia , related cardiac disease , bundle branch block , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Subjects baseline symptom fever and/or cough and/or shortness breath and/or wheeze and/or fatigue grade &gt; /= 2 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) 5 . Patients unresectable lung metastasis . 6 . Patients without sarcoma , renal cell carcinoma , melanoma .</criteria>
