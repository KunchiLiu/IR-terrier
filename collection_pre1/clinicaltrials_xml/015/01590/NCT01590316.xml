	<brief_summary>Background 25,000 infant bear extremely preterm every year Europe . This group infants carry high risk death subsequent cerebral impairment infant , especially first 72 hour life . Mortality 20 % , 25 % survivor live either cerebral palsy low intelligence quotient . Preventative measure key reduce mortality morbidity population . There evidence cerebral oxygenation time spend range ( time hypoxia hyperoxia ) associate poor outcome infant . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) use monitor tissue oxygenation since mid-1980s , quantification oxygenation ( rStO2 ) percentage 0 100 % possible 10 year . From almost 400 preterm infant normal range rStO2 determine 55 % 85 % . Still , clinical trial thus solid evidence clinical utility NIRS preterm infant . Thus , research benefit harm cerebral monitoring use NIRS part clinical management premature infant much need . Objectives The primary objective SafeBoosC trial examine possible stabilise cerebral oxygenation extremely preterm infant first 72 hour life application cerebral NIRS oximetry implementation rStO2-specific clinical treatment guideline . We hypothesise use specify treatment guideline respond cerebral monitoring reading outside target range , would reduce burden hypo- hyperoxia consequently reduce brain injury . Trial design This investigator-initiated randomised , blind , multinational , phase II feasibility clinical trial involve preterm infant 12 European country . Inclusion criteria The inclusion criterion : neonate bear 12 week preterm ( gestational age 27 week 6 day ) ; decision conduct full life support ; parental inform consent ; cerebral NIRS oximeter place within 3 hour birth . Sample size With 50 % reduction area outside normal range oxygenation % hour experimental group compare control group minimal clinically significant difference , standard deviation area outside normal range 83.2 % hour , type I error ( alpha ) 5 % , type II error 0.05 ( power 95 % ) inclusion 75 preterm infant experimental group 75 preterm infant control group require . The inclusion twin likely decrease power , decide increase sample size 165 pragmatic basis estimate intracluster correlation , control event rate , incidence twin birth . Intervention The premature infant randomise one two group ( experimental control ) . Common group cerebral oximeter monitor device place within three hour birth . In experimental group , cerebral oxygenation read visible , infant treat accordingly use define treatment guideline . In control group , cerebral oxygenation read NOT visible , infant treat usual . Trial duration Monitoring cerebral oximeter start soon possible within 3 hour birth intervention last 72 hour . Thereafter , neonate follow term date ( approximately three month birth ) 24 month term date . Outcome measure The primary outcome burden hypo- hyperoxia % hour first 72 hour birth . The secondary outcome brain activity amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram ( aEEG ) , blood biomarkers ( brain fatty acid bind protein ( BFABP ) , neuroketal , S100Î² ) , serious adverse reaction ( SARs ) , severe brain injury , cause mortality term date ( approximately three month birth ) . The exploratory outcome burden hypoxia , burden hyperoxia , neonatal morbidity , brain injury score magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , number therapy implement intervention , physiological variable ( mean blood pressure ( BP ) , pulse oximeter oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , partial pressure carbon dioxide ( pCO2 ) ) , psychomotor impairment accord neurodevelopmental scale 24 month term date .</brief_summary>
