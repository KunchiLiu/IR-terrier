	<brief_summary>The historical standard treatment early-stage squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx radiation therapy . Some patient require chemotherapy radiation , patient require surgery tumour lymph node respond radiation . This study compare radiation therapy new surgical treatment call transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) . TORS new surgical approach use robot assist surgeon remove tumour , potentially few side effect older surgical technique .</brief_summary>
