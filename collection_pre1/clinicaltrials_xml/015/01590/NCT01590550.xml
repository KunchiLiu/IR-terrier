	<brief_summary>Providing hemodialysis require use extracorporeal circuit must anticoagulated . Inadequate anticoagulation result dialyzer clot decrease circuit blood flow , inefficient dialysis even significant blood loss secondary circuit clotting.Heparin traditional agent use provide anticoagulation . Heparin multiple adverse side effect would best avoid acutely ill patient risk bleed . Alternative mean provide anticoagulation include citrate base anticoagulation . Citrasate® heparin free anticoagulant alternative FDA approve since 1999 readily available commercial use since 2001 . Citrasate® utilizes citric acid instead acetic acid acidification ; presence small amount citrate dialysate also provide mean anticoagulation . The concentration citrate low ( 2.4meq/L ) thus minimal effect serum calcium value . No calcium monitor infusion indicate . The purpose study obtain data use Citrasate® admit pediatric patient receive hemodialysis part therapy acute kidney injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Citrate Based Dialysis Pediatric Patients Receiving Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient require inpatient hemodialysis screen participation study base inclusion exclusion criterion note . Informed consent hemodialysis study participation obtain attend nephrologist prior start dialysis session . Patient specific hemodialysis order place attend nephrology physician patient use standardized hemodialysis order form . Citrasate® standard concentration , standard blood flow 600 -800 ml/min prescribe study patient , calcium potassium content dialysate determine attend pediatric nephrologist . Monitoring : All patient routine monitoring indicate clinical care dialysis session . Data Collection : Each treatment document standardized hemodialysis run sheet . Data collection perform one researcher use data collection sheet ensure uniformity data collection method . Data collect include patient demographic , admit diagnosis , underlie renal disease , presence acute kidney injury versus chronic kidney disease , contraindication heparin use presence bleed diathesis . Dialysis specific data collect include site type dialysis access , dialysis prescription parameter treatment duration . Lab data collect include pre , post intradialytic ionized calcium value , ACT value pH bicarbonate value . Data number saline bolus require maintain circuit patency , percent prescribe blood flow achieve well use heparin collect . Data Analysis include - T-test comparison change ionize calcium value , blood pH bicarbonate value - Percentage patient inadequate coagulation citrate ( ie . patient grade III-IV streaking require change heparin base dialysate ) - Percent patient adverse event account routine dialysis session - Cost analysis difference cost use Citrasate® compare standard heparin base dialysis treatment</detailed_description>
