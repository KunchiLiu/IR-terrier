	<brief_summary>The primary aim study test effect excitation ventral striatal circuitry via DBS ( e.g . DBS-on versus DBS-off ) reward motivation . The investigator predict stimulation increase subject willingness expend effort reward facilitate motivation reward learning . The investigator predict individual difference effect DBS reward motivation associate effect DBS treatment anhedonic symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study take place clinical office Charlestown Navy Yard ( CNY ) , consist one 4 4.5-hour visit . Study staff schedule convenient time patient arrive , research visit may pair regularly schedule DBS program visit . A member Division Neurotherapeutics authorize manipulate DBS program turn device study . The subject 's therapeutic parameter DBS system change . The subject ask complete four self-report questionnaire : Temporal Experience Pleasure questionnaire , Chapman Anhedonia Questionnaire , Perceived Stress Questionnaire ( PSS ) Mood Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire ( MASQ ) . Following questionnaire , member study staff teach subject perform follow task computer : Effort Expenditure Rewards Task ( EEfRT ) To measure motivation work reward , use Effort Expenditure Rewards Task ( EEfRT `` effort '' ) . The EEfRT multi-trial computer-based task ass individual 's willingness expend effort chance earn monetary reward develop Michael Treadway David Zald Vanderbilt University ( Treadway et al. , 2009 ) . On trial , subject give opportunity choose two different task difficulty level order obtain monetary reward . For trial , subject must make repeated manual button press set period time . Each button press raise level virtual `` bar '' view onscreen subject . Subjects eligible win money allot trial able raise bar `` top '' within prescribed time period . This button-press task two level difficulty : referred henceforth 'hard task ' 'easy task ' . Successful completion hard task trial require subject make 100 button press , use non-dominant pinky finger within 30 second , successful completion easy task trial require subject make 30 button press , use dominant index finger within 10 second . For easy task choice , subject eligible win amount trial successfully complete task . For hard task choice , subject eligible win amount varies per trial . Subjects guarantee win state reward complete task ; trial 'win ' trial , subject receives state reward amount , others 'no win ' trial , subject receive money trial . To help subject determine trial likely win trial , subject provide probability cue begin trial . Trials three level probability : 88 % probability win trial , 50 % 12 % . There equal proportion probability level across experiment . Each level probability appear conjunction level reward value hard task . At begin task , subject provide detailed set instruction , opportunity play 4 practice trial . Subjects tell twenty ( 20 ) minute play many trial . Easy Task choice take approximately 15 second , whereas Hard Task choice take approximately 30 second . Therefore , number trial subject able play depend part choice make . This mean make Hard Task trial early-on experiment result few trial total , may mean subject get chance play high-value , high-probability trial could appear towards end playing time . This trade-off explain clearly subject . The goal trade-off ensure neither strategy always choose easy hard option lead optimal performance task . Moreover , complexity variable ( vary monetary reward level , probability , loss time future trial ) , lend formal calculation optimal response selection , force Subjects make relatively rapid decision , believe tap individual difference willingness expend effort give level expect reward value . At end task , two trial randomly select add subject 's compensation reward incentive . Subjects therefore may earn additional fund incentive performance compensation time complete EEfRT . Clock Task The `` clock task '' additional reward task assess reward learn develop Michael Frank colleague ( Moustafa et al. , 2008 ; Frank et al. , 2009 ) . For task , participant observe clock arm complete revolution course 5 second , participant instruct press key stop clock time attempt win point . The amount point vary depend RT , participant must use trial-and-error strategy learn stop clock maximize point receive . To prevent subject form explicitly learn reward value associate specific location clock face , reward value give point along clock face randomize within +/- 5 point . At end task , subject may redeem point small amount additional compensation , time complete task . This task take approximately 15 minute complete . 30 minute turn OFF DBS stimulation , participant either remain OFF condition DBS turn ON , depend counter-balanced condition assignment . Subject assignment alternate sequentially . Subjects complete task first condition . Following task completion , subject DBS stimulation turn OFF ON ( , depend condition assignment ) . After 30 minute , participant complete task second condition . Following retesting , participant OFF condition return ON DBS stimulation . We use implanted pulse generator , possible deliver unsafe current . Because change therapeutic parameter stimulation , subject experience adverse side effect . The computer register subject 's performance . Electroencephalography recording ( EEG ) acquire performance aforementioned task . Continuous EEG data sample maximum 1024Hz use 64-electrode cap . Eye movement artifact assess use bipolar electrode . Patients major depressive disorder obsessive compulsive disorder also recruit control group patient deep brain stimulation .</detailed_description>
