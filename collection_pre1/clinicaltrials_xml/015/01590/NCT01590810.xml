	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety tolerability MK-8150 effect central systolic blood pressure ( cSBP ) heart rate correct augmentation index ( AIx ) give single oral dos healthy male male mild-to-moderate hypertension . A primary study hypothesis post dose mean change baseline time-weighted average across 24 hour ( TWA0-24hrs ) cSBP AIx reduce participant administer MK-8150 compare placebo male mild moderate hypertension . A mean decrease baseline compare placebo ≥5 mm Hg TWA0-24hrs cSBP ≥5 percentage point TWA0-24hrs AIx consider clinically meaningful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Rising Dose Study MK-8150 ( MK-8150-001 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up three plan panel ( A , B C ) either 8 healthy participant 8 participant mild moderate hypertension enrol . For Panel A Panel B , dose occur alternate fashion Panel A Panel B dose commence Panel A . Participants receive alternate single rise oral dos MK-8150 placebo 5 treatment period ( Periods 1 5 ) . Subsequent dos Panel administer careful evaluation safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic effect give dose . For Panel C , participant receive single rise oral dos MK-8150 placebo 5 treatment period ( Periods 1 5 ) . Depending safety , tolerability hemodynamic effect observe healthy participant , Panels A and/or B may truncate dosing may proceed Panel C hypertensive participant . In case , dose hypertensive participant Panel C start second high dose achieve healthy participant . Amendment 1 protocol add Panel D ( healthy male ) base pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic safety result Panels A-C . Participants Panel D receive single rise oral dos MK-8150 placebo 5 treatment period ( Periods 1 5 ) dose range 50 mg 500 mg MK-8150 . Each treatment period approximately 3-4 day apart .</detailed_description>
