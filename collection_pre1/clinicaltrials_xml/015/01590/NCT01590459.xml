	<detailed_description>VX-509 oral , selective Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) inhibitor develop Vertex . In autoimmune disease , JAK3 essential component immune signal cascade . This cascade ultimately contribute abnormal immune response result chronic inflammation , case rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , irreversible damage cartilage bone . Selective inhibition JAK3 offer new disease modify approach treatment RA , broad range autoimmune disease .</detailed_description>
