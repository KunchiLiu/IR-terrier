	<brief_summary>This multi-centre , multi-national , prospective , observational study Huntington 's disease ( HD ) control group volunteer : - obtain natural history data many HD mutation carrier individual part HD family - relate phenotypical characteristic ( genetic modifier / wet dry biomarkers ) - expedite identification recruitment participant clinical trial - develop validate sensitive reliable outcome measure detect onset change natural course premanifest manifest HD may also potential outcome measure use future clinical trial clinical care - plan future research study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REGISTRY - Observational Study European Huntington 's Disease Network ( EHDN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REGISTRY integrate prospectively systematically collected clinical research data ( e.g . phenotypical clinical feature , family history , demographical characteristic ) access biological specimen ( e.g . blood , urine ) obtain individual manifest HD , unaffected individual know carry HD mutation risk carry HD mutation , control research participant ( e.g . spouse , sibling offspring HD mutation carrier know carry HD mutation ) . REGISTRY open-ended study eligible subject assess annual study visit phenotypical characteristic HD regardless whether display clinical symptom sign disease individual part HD family ( irrespective mutation carrier status ) . At study visit , general clinical , motor function , behavior , cognitive , Health Economics , Quality Life assessment administer . In addition , participant give option consent donation biosamples purpose mutation ( CAG repeat length ) test research identify biological modifier marker HD . Biological specimens phenotypical data make available qualified scientist whose project review approved Scientific Bioethical Advisory Committee ( SBAC ) EHDN . Successful applicant agree accept EHDN policy surround use data/materials provide publication result ( see data share publication policy EHDN , attach ) . Research project aim advance scientific knowledge towards establish clinically effective treatment delay onset and/or slow progression disease .</detailed_description>
