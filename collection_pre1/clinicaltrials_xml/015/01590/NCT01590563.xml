	<brief_summary>Current intrauterine device ( IUD ) pose risk uterine perforation insertion , malposition expulsion . The investigated device , IUB ( tm ) SCu300A IUD insert similar fashion uterus take three dimensional spherical shape curve away fundus . Apart anticipated reduction rate state complication , small size mallable characteristic also expect improve user experience . The clinical trial intend evaluate safety initial efficacy novel device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Initial Efficacy Novel Intrauterine Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A copper IUD ( intrauterine device coil ) type intrauterine contraceptive device . Most IUDs plastic T-shaped frame wrap copper wire sleeve . The device fit inside remove uterine cavity doctor qualify medical practitioner . It remain place entire time pregnancy desire . The IUD long act reversible contraceptive , different IUDs intend last different lengths time , usually 3 10 year . The length time device last depend mainly amount expose copper , indicate , square millimeter , number name device ( i.e. , Paragard T-380A 380 square millimeter expose copper ) . The IUD world 's widely use method reversible birth control , currently use 175 million woman . The mechanism IUDs well understood . It know however presence device uterus prompt release leukocytes prostaglandin endometrium . These substance hostile sperm egg ; presence copper increase spermicidal effect . The general medical consensus spermicidal ovicidal mechanisms way IUDs work . Some physician medical text suggest may secondary effect interfere development pre-implanted embryo ; secondary effect consider plausible IUD use emergency contraception . Second-generation copper-T IUDs failure rate less 1 % per year , cumulative 10-year failure rate 2-6 % . A copper IUD may also use emergency contraception . If IUD insert within five day unprotected intercourse , woman 's chance pregnancy reduce ongoing IUD user . IUDs protect STDs PID . Made shape memory alloy specific size shape , SCu300A IUB™ insert insertion tube much like regular IUDs , however , push , uterus , take spherical shape . An important feature include downwards curve opposite uterine fundus emerge tube , minimize risk perforation . The three dimensional shape 's elasticity allow good amenability uterus , nullify possibility malposition final outer diameter reduce probability expulsion . Lacking rigid protruding segment significantly small IUDs , IUB™ expect reduce distortion tissue irritation , possibly result less bleeding , discomfort pain , lead low discontinuation rate . A thread attach IUB™ allow easy removal . The trialed IUB™ copper-based ( Cu surface area 300mm2 ) . This study aim ass IUB™ 's safety initial efficacy . Endpoints include assessment change discomfort , pain menorrhea , change endometrium discontinuation rate well user experience . These result use regulatory evidence also help reaffirm assumption IUB™ 's design contribute low complication side effect rate .</detailed_description>
