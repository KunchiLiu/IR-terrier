	<brief_summary>Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) rapidly lethal cancer arise parietal pleural mesothelium , associate exposure asbestos . Once rare disease , increase incidence UK presently common cervical cancer . MPM characterize local invasion adjacent structure include chest wall , mediastinum , diaphragm pericardium result progressive shortness breath . Median survival best supportive care alone approximately 6-9 month case mesothelioma present advanced setting . Therefore trial look whether new drug , Ganetespib improvement survival type patient .</brief_summary>

Ability understand willing sign write informed consent participate ( include donation diagnostic biopsy tissue research ) 11 . Ability comply requirement protocol 1 . Prior exposure investigational commercial agent therapy administer intent treat patient 's malignancy . This include crizotinib , ALKtargeted agent , Hsp90 inhibitor ( e.g . ganetespib ) . Prior valproic acid acceptable least 30 day washout period 2 . Evidence CNS metastases opinion investigator receive local treatment prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited : Symptomatic neurological illness Active uncontrolled systemic infection consider opportunistic , life threaten clinically significant time treatment Significant pulmonary disease hypoxia Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance trial requirement Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient Known hepatitis B C infection Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 4 .
