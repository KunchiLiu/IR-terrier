	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Infection inadequate diet proximate risk factor under-nutrition early life growth falter ; two process likely act reciprocally vicious cycle perpetuate physiologic metabolic deficit increase risk mortality . Children exhibit growth falter likely deficit cognitive development long-term human capital , likely child also suffer growth deficit - perpetuate cycle next generation . There two probable interdependent pathway link enteric infection child growth development . The first pathway include repeat infection lead acute illness parasitic infection first year life , increase risk stunt subsequent cognitive deficit childhood later life . The second pathway subclinical condition call environmental enteropathy ( EE ) . There limited evidence demonstrate whether water quality , sanitation , hand washing ( WASH ) intervention improve measure EE , child growth development , whether nutritional intervention could enhance provide concurrently WASH intervention . To help fill evidence gap , WASH Benefits study deliver randomize intervention design reduce infection improve nutrition , measure intervention effect child illness , growth development . WASH Benefits include two , comparable standalone trial Bangladesh Kenya register separate protocol . In Bangladesh , study include 720 cluster , cluster enroll 8 household compound ( bari ) pregnant woman second third trimester . The study randomize 90 cluster 6 active intervention arm ( water quality , sanitation , hand washing , combine WSH , nutrition , nutrition+WSH ) , 180 cluster standard practice non-intervention arm . Children born cohort follow 2 year intervention , measurement 12 24 month intervention delivery . ( anticipated age range : 20 - 27 month old final measurement ) . At 12- 24-month follow-up visit , study collect child anthropometric measurement caregiver-reported diarrhea . In final visit study administer test measure child development outcomes . The study collect urine , blood , stool specimen subsample 1,500 child distribute across four arm study ( Control , combine WSH , Nutrition , Nutrition+WSH ) measure biomarkers gut function intestinal parasitic infection 12- 24-month follow-up visit . In addition , study collect specimen ( blood , stool ) child 18 - 27 month old baseline living compound target child test intestinal parasitic infection . At 24-months arm , study collect specimens stool target child , child 18 - 27 month old baseline , school-aged child , adult live compound target child test intestinal parasitic infection . At 36-months arm , study collect specimens stool target child , school-aged child , adult live compound target child test intestinal parasitic infection .</detailed_description>
