	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose doxycycline combine temozolomide ipilimumab patient advance melanoma . The safety level effectiveness study drug combination also study . Doxycycline design treat bacterial infection . It also block protein call iNOS important tumor cell growth , may slow growth kill cancer cell . Temozolomide design stop cancer cell make new DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may stop cancer cell divide new cell . Ipilimumab design block activity cell decrease immune system 's ability fight cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 28 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose doxycycline receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level doxycycline . Each new group receive high dose doxycycline group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose doxycycline find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive doxycycline high clinically active dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level temozolomide ipilimumab . Study Drug Administration : You start take doxycycline Day -6 Cycle 1 ( 1 week Day 1 Cycle 1 start ) mouth 2 time day 1 week . You fast ( eat drink anything water ) least 2 hour 1 hour take study drug . After , Day 1 Cycle 1 , start take combination temozolomide ipilimumab . You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute every 3 week . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , start take temozolomide mouth 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water Days 1-4 cycle . You fast least 2 hour 2 hour take study drug . You continue take doxycycline mouth 2 time day throughout study . Each study cycle 3 week except first cycle , 4 week . This include 1 week doxycycline give . You give study drug diary record time dos take study drug . You bring diary study visit . You also bring leftover study drug study visit . Study visit : At every study visit , ask drug may take , feeling , side effect . On Day -6 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam do past 8 day . - Your weight vital sign measure . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test do past 8 day . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - You ECG . - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , Phase II study , tumor biopsy perform test doxycycline able block iNOS protein . This biopsy optional Phase I . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , Phase I : - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - Your vital sign measure . - Your performance status record . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , Phase I , blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Every 6 week ( 2 cycle ) , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or bone scan check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue take doxycycline long doctor think best interest . You may continue receive temozolomide ipilimumab 4 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , start health problem , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - You ECG . - You tumor biopsy perform test change level iNOS protein . This investigational study . Temozolomide FDA approve commercially available treat advance brain tumor . It commonly use treat advanced melanoma FDA approve . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treat advance melanoma . Doxycycline FDA approve commercially available treat various infection , use treat cancer investigational . Up 58 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
