	<brief_summary>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) novel brain stimulation technique use pulsate magnetic field stimulate underlying neuron cerebral cortex . The investigator propose open-label pilot study investigate effectiveness rTMS treatment tinnitus stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , area know important mood attention , along stimulation leave temporoparietal cortex ( TPC ) . This feasibility pilot study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS Bimodal Treatment For Tinnitus : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Converging data implicate structure brain important mood attention play role maintenance tinnitus ; suggest alternative rTMS treatment approach target structure . A grow number study demonstrate involvement prefrontal cortex generation maintenance tinnitus . rTMS stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex association stimulation temporoparietal cortex show increase durability TPC stimulation . The independent effect rTMS stimulation DLPFC know . Studies depression suggest increase intensity duration stimulation beneficial treatment effect . However , field new work need assess effectiveness treatment , predictor correlate response , safety . Recent exciting work schizophrenia use bimodal ( DLPFC TPC ) treatment approach pharmacologically non-responsive patient . The study use high-frequency stimulation leave DLPFC low-frequency stimulation leave TPC . Bimodal rTMS stimulation leave DLPFC leave TPC induce clinical improvement pharmacologically non-responsive schizophrenia patient may improve short-term verbal memories.57</detailed_description>
