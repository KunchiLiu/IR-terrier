	<brief_title>An Evaluation Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Oral Dabigatran Etexilate Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The frequency atrial fibrillation ( AF ) 10- 20- fold high patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) compare general population ( 1-5 ) . Conditions contribute risk stroke AF highly prevalent ESRD patient undergoing dialysis ( 6 ) . A large number trial show usefulness oral anticoagulation warfarin sodium primary secondary prevention stroke patient AF ( 7 ) . Despite majority trial exclude patient ESRD , warfarin sodium commonly prescribed dialysis patient AF prevention stroke ( 8 ) . Managing dialysis patient wafarin sodium challenge give plethora drug food interaction , need frequent coagulation monitoring dose adjustment lack large randomize clinical trail assess benefit stroke prevention versus risk hemorrhage population ( 8,9 ) . Additionally , recent concern regard association vascular calcification enhance warfarin sodium dialysis patient highlight need alternative oral anticoagulant therapy ( 10,11 ) . A new oral anticoagulant , dabigatran etexilate , direct thrombin inhibitor , approve prevention stroke patient AF prevention venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) patient undergone elective total hip knee replacement surgery ( 12-15 ) . Other indication investigation include treatment VTE ( 16 ) treatment thromboembolic complication follow acute coronary syndrome ( 17 ) . Dabigatran etexilate orally administer prodrug , rapidly absorb convert active form , dabigatran . Dabigatran specifically reversibly inhibit thrombin key enzyme require coagulation pathway . Dabigatran etexilate posse beneficial property include : fixed oral dosage regimen , predictable pharmacokinetic profile , strong association plasma drug concentration anticoagulation response , low potential drug interaction lack need routine coagulation monitoring ( 18-24 ) . As , dabigatran etexilate represent possible improve alternative warfarin anticoagulation dialysis patient AF . Dabigatran etexilate develop use fix dosage regimen 150 mg twice daily AF patient normal renal function prevention stroke ( 12 ) . Limited information regard dose dabigatran etexilate patient renal impairment ESRD exist patient exclude phase III trial . Despite , recent small study investigate pharmacokinetics single oral dose dabigatran etexilate 150 mg healthy patient patient mild severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ≤80 , &gt; 30 ≤50 &lt; 30 mL/min ) dabigatran etexilate 50 mg patient ESRD require maintenance hemodialysis ( 25 ) . Systemic exposure dabigatran correspond coagulation response increase renal impairment correlate severity renal dysfunction suggest reduce dose extend dose interval may necessary patient mild severe renal impairment . In six patient study , hemodialysis remove average 62 % 68 % dabigatran enter dialyzer indicate hemodialysis compensate impair dabigatran renal elimination occur ESRD . Unfortunately , meaningful correlation dabigatran plasma concentration anticoagulation activity could determine hemodialysis patient unfractionated heparin prevent clot dialysis circuit . Furthermore , necessity post-dialysis dose maintain dabigatran level therapeutic range investigate . Herein , propose pilot study examine single dose pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics dabigatran etexilate hemodialysis patient receive normal saline flush prevention extracorporeal circuit clotting . The specific objective establish baseline correlation plasma dabigatran concentration versus anticoagulation activity time . Our long-term objective develop evidence-based recommendation dabigatran dose hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
