	<detailed_description>Malignant obstruction extra-hepatic bile duct often lead jaundice pruritus occasionally result cholangitis bacteremia . Pancreatic cancer account large proportion patient present malignant extra-hepatic biliary obstruction . Most pancreatic cancer unresectable presentation , palliation , include biliary decompression , often goal therapy . Over last decade , biliary decompression endoscopically-placed stent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) largely replaced surgical bilioenteric diversion . Biliary decompression via endoscopic stenting alleviates cholestatic symptom improve quality life . When compare surgery , endoscopically place plastic stent result decrease morbidity trend towards decrease 30 day mortality . However , surgery associate low risk recurrent biliary obstruction . Stent diameter important factor determine duration biliary luminal patency . All plastic biliary stent ultimately occlude due deposition bacterial biofilm . The original plastic biliary stent 7 French ( Fr ) diameter , patency rate 4 week . With increase size work channel duodenoscopes , limit factor diameter stent deploy , 10 Fr stent develop , patency rate approximately 15 week ( 3-4 month ) . Until recently , large stent could deploy current endoscopic technology use conventional duodenoscope acceptable outer diameter 11.5 Fr ; limit available data suggest stent offer prolonged luminal patency interval compare 10 Fr stent . In early 1990s , self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) become available use palliation malignant biliary obstruction . Once deploy , SEMS achieve large diameter plastic stent , result longer median patency interval approximately six eight month . [ 3 , 6 , 9-12 ] Although effective , metal stent eight ten time costly plastic stent . Recently , large work channel duodenoscope acceptable outer diameter develop . This prototype duodenoscope allow passage large stent , investigator successfully place select case use prototype . This duodenoscope , manufacture Olympus Medical Systems Corp. , FDA approve . The investigator hypothesize , substantially increase luminal diameter , large plastic stent provide prolonged relief obstructive jaundice patient malignant distal common bile duct stricture . If prof true , large plastic stent may constitute cost-effective alternative SEMS , especially health care system afford SEMS .</detailed_description>
