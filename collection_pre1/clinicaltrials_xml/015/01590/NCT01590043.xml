	<brief_summary>Under normal condition intestinal mucosa present baseline `` physiological inflammation '' cause control immune response eliminate offend dietary microbial antigen . This inflammation disappear cause eradicate . In case inappropriate immunological response , inflammation become chronic harmful , result anatomical functional abnormality , namely inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Although critical IBD patient undergo early diagnosis management development severe complication , IBD vague non-pathognomonic clinical feature , clinician usually mislead late suspicion detection IBD . Diagnosis traditionally depend combination pathologic evaluation together histological , clinical , radiological , endoscopic , surgical , laboratory ( serological ) feature . Recently , serological marker identify become special interest detect occurrence IBD also potential development may use prognostic tool . More recently , stool marker detect used diagnosis . Up , market still lack definitive , simple non-invasive diagnostic tool . Saliva present alternative form body fluid simplify diagnostic procedure . Our hypothesis IBD patient special salivary biomarkers may identify salivary analysis , later simple non-invasive test apply form easy-to-use kit , available clinician 's clinic establishment immediate early diagnosis destructive inflammatory bowel disease .</brief_summary>
