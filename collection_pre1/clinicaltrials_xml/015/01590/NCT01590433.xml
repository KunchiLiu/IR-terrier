	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct study investigate possible mechanism weight loss associate exenatide treatment metabolic characteristic high responder ( i.e . subject achieve great 5 % weight loss ) exenatide treatment . The investigator also examine magnitude duration weight loss among cohort high responder 52 week treatment , 3 6 month follow treatment . Hypothesis : The mechanism weight loss exenatide fully understood , weight loss response exenatide highly variable , possibly reflect distinct metabolic parameter . By identify follow group obese woman lose great 5 % body weight short-term exenatide treatment , investigator gain insight possible mechanism weight loss ass long-term weight loss pharmacotherapeutic intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcomes The primary objective study : - To investigate possible mechanism pattern weight loss exenatide treatment , especially among individual robust early weight loss ( great 5 % weight loss 12 week ) exenatide . Secondary Outcomes Our secondary objective identify metabolic characteristic predict robust response exenatide treatment . Outcome measurement : - Weight - Body composition - Resting energy expenditure ( REE ) - Mixed meal test - Thermic effect food - Serum metabolic parameter - Hunger/Nausea/Satiety visual analog scale ( VAS ) - Physical activity monitoring Study Population The study population generally healthy , non-diabetic woman age 18-70 year BMI 28-48 kg/m^2 .</detailed_description>
