	<brief_summary>Huntington disease ( HD ) inherit neurodegenerative disease affect 30,000 people United States Australia . HD characterize brain cell death usually begin age 30 50 , result motor , cognitive behavioral sign symptom . While medication help relieve disease symptom , know treatment address cognitive impairment associate HD . Normally occur metal brain play significant role disease Alzheimer disease HD . PBT2 drug design interrupt interaction biological metal target protein brain , prevent deterioration brain cell . PBT2 , show animal model , well small group patient Alzheimer 's disease , may improve cognition . There indication animal model HD , drug may improve motor function control reduce amount brain cell degeneration . PBT2-203 evaluate safe well tolerate PBT2 dose 100 mg 250 mg day administer oral daily capsule compare placebo six month treatment period . The trial also measure whether effect cognitive ability well HD symptom include motor overall functioning individual HD .</brief_summary>
