	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluating Safety &amp; Efficacy DCBT : NiCord® &amp; UNM CBU SCD Patients After Myeloablative Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) alternative stem cell source hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) use treatment various life-threatening disease , hematological malignancy genetic blood disorder , case match related stem cell donor available . However , major drawback use valuable stem cell source limit cell dose single cord blood unit ( CBU ) , show associated inadequate hematopoietic reconstitution high risk transplant-related mortality . To improve outcome extend applicability UCB transplantation , one potential solution ex vivo expansion UCB-derived stem progenitor cell . NiCord® stem/progenitor cell base product compose ex vivo expand allogeneic UCB cell . NiCord® base novel technology ex vivo cell expansion cord blood derive hematopoietic progenitor cell . By increase number short long-term reconstitution progenitor cell transplant , NiCord® potential enable broad application UCB transplantation , improve clinical outcome UCB transplantation . The study design pilot , single center , single arm study , evaluate safety efficacy co-transplantation NiCord® unmanipulated CBU patient SCD follow myeloablative therapy . The total study duration approximately 220 day , start signing inform consent last visit day 180 post-transplant . A long-term post-study follow-up plan 6 month post-study completion ( 1 year post-transplantation ) , long-term follow-up use Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) registry . The study hypothesis co-transplantation NiCord® unmanipulated unrelated cord blood graft patient SCD follow myeloablative preparative therapy consist hydroxyurea , busulfan , cyclophosphamide ATG safe enable cord blood engraftment . The main study objective assessment acute toxicity associate infusion NiCord® within 24 hour post infusion , assessment cumulative incidence donor-derived neutrophil engraftment day 42 follow co-transplantation NiCord® unmanipulated cord blood graft . In addition , proportion transplant-related mortality 100 day , event-free survival 100 day overall survival 180 day assess . Ten evaluable patient recruit study 2-21 year age , least 10 kg weight , symptomatic SCD consider candidate allogeneic myeloablative HSCT treatment SCD .</detailed_description>
