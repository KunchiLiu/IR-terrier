	<brief_summary>The study aim monitor progression symptom sign affect JHD use modify UHDRS scale motor function ( functional assessment , TFC ) . This provide basic data analyse usefulness propose rating scale . Specifically , initial aim ass rating scale use iterative process . There may significant delay diagnosis JHD especially young person present behavioural problem . Caregivers ask question capture number contact professional time onset concern young person confirmation diagnosis . Aim monitor progression symptom sign affect JHD use modify UHDRS scale motor function ( functional assessment , TFC ) . This provide basic data analyse usefulness propose rating scale .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Juvenile Huntington 's disease ( JHD ) , define motor symptom onset 21 year age , recognise one end phenotypic spectrum HD . In many study proportion case meet definition vary , usually less 10 % probably 5 % . At present , treatment available alter natural history condition ; however , considerable research activity undertaken identify novel treatment . Any new disease-modifying treatment evaluate clinical trial predetermine outcome measure . Given relatively slow rate progression HD , trial may last several year consequence less attractive commercial perspective . Patients JHD extensive pathology frequently exclude clinical trial differ phenotype ; study assess feasibility use rating scale ; modification use sensitive disease progression relatively short time period , likely significant impact study trial design cost . Given rarity JHD , wide collaboration scientist , clinician family affect JHD internationally important . As might expect , pathology JHD widespread . Therefore , need ability ass treatment , alter natural history subgroup patient .</detailed_description>
