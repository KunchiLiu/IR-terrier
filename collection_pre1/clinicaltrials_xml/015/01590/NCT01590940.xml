	<brief_summary>The use synthetic mesh plug open inguinal hernia repair see dramatic variability number composition mesh currently world market . The use biomaterials ( PLLA , PGA ) hernia mesh relatively new innovative method . These select polymer ability degrade implant , allow sufficient natural tissue heal scar . This usage presumably favor decrease foreignness , inflammatory reaction , recurrence , incidence chronic groin pain . Prior study similar plug mesh indication yield favorable result require mesh investigate specific application . Primary Objective Evaluate incidence peri-operative post-operative complication application Parietex plug patch hernia system open inguinal hernia repair . We assess efficacy mesh examination application pain scale follow interval : 1 month , 3 month , 1 year , respectively . Assessment intend evaluate : - Patient report pain via Pain score - Wound complication - Incidence chronic groin pain - Recurrence rate - Other complication Secondary Objectives Record description assessment Parietex plug patch hernia system : - surgical technique - description dissection mesh placement - method fixation - operative time , anesthesia choice - length hospital stay - mesh handle characteristic - return daily activity - overall patient satisfaction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Parietex Plug Patch Hernia System Open Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This post-market single center pilot study evaluate efficacy safety Parietex plug patch hernia system follow open inguinal hernia repair . The Parietex plug patch hernia system compose : - pre-cut patch make lightweight monofilament polyester - semiresorbable disk bio-component make polyester monofilament poly-L-lactic acid ( PLLA ) . Patients meet criterion study invite join study consult prior surgery . F. Andrew Morfesis M.D . FACS consent patient , offer answer question address concern . Once patient provide informed consent , give hernia surgery specific survey ( mesh specific quality life scale ) test parameter pain , discomfort movement , pain frequency . Post operatively , research assistant review chart collect data secondary objective Operative Note . This data enter secure excel database . It explain Dr. Morfesis questionnaires must complete in-person subsequent follow-up visit . Follow-up visit schedule 1 month , 3 month , 1 year , time patient examine , fill hernia surgery specific measure evaluate pain follow . If patient schedule follow-up visit , pain questionnaire give phone research assistant reduce data loss . Subject Selection This study include 50 patient follow criterion describe : Inclusion Criteria - All patient regardless gender &gt; 18 year age present inguinal hernia . - Subjects informed nature study , provide sign write consent . Exclusion Criteria Excluded group include : - child age 18 - subject meet criterion biologic mesh placement - emergency procedure - recurrent hernia . Withdrawal Criteria Subjects may withdraw withdrawn study time . The reason discontinuation collect . Additionally , subject may withdraw study principle investigator noncompliance study procedure . Study Assessments The study subject evaluate follow time point : Screening ( pre-operative ) Patients informed Dr. Morfesis nature study agreement participate sign consent obtain . Prior medical/surgical history obtain time consultation . Any additional testing imaging may need also obtained time surgery . Patients receive pre-operative hernia pain scale . This scale tailor numerous validated hernia mesh scale assess type pain , frequency pain , quality life . Procedure OR time Intra-operative device relate adverse event Technique Method fixation Length hospital stay Mesh handle Type anesthesia Follow-up occur 1 month , 3 month , 1 year visit Patients fill hernia pain scale . Wound examination Scar thickness appearance Suture infections Post-operative device relate adverse event Recurrence Chronic groin pain Other complication</detailed_description>
