	<brief_summary>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( CTS ) recognisable pattern symptom sign , cause compression median ( middle ) nerve pass carpal tunnel wrist . This condition affect individual cause pain , numbness , tingle sensation sometimes weakness finger may extend shoulder neck area . The cause case unknown ( idiopathic ) though common condition associate increased incidence , include obesity , pregnancy , hypothyroidism , arthritis , diabetes , trauma . Diagnosis primarily clinical condition easily recognise characteristic symptom straightforward case diagnostic support provide investigation nerve conduction study ultrasound image . Treatment may include splint , local steroid injection wrist , activity modification , physical occupational therapy ( controversial ) , medication , surgery . Treatment local therapeutic ultrasound suggest effective exist trial inconclusive . Wrist splint partially effective success rate 34 % , Steroid injection follow frequent relapse remain uncertainty safety serial injection . Surgery effective small significant incidence permanent complication . Any demonstrably effective safe addition therapeutic option would significant advance treatment . Therapeutic ultrasound present appear promising option , good safety record far uncertain evidence efficacy . In trial patient , mild carpal tunnel syndrome , confirm nerve conduction study , give wrist splint patient leave untreated . They randomly allocate either therapeutic sham ultrasound therapy ( 20 session 7 week ) follow 1year . The patient , operator ultrasound equipment assessor blind treatment allocation . The effect treatment symptom assess use validated questionnaire nerve conduction study repeat completion ultrasound treatment , 6 12 month . This study design find whether therapeutic ultrasound effective treatment carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral nerve disorder UK . Average annual incidence ( per 100 000 ) 139.4 woman 67.2 men East Kent , UK . It significant economic impact , average large recuperation period injury / illness require day away work . It cause tingle , numbness pain distribution median nerve ( thumb , index , middle finger , half ring finger ) often bad night cause waken . The pathology idiopathic CTS non-inflammatory fibrosis subsynovial connective tissue surround flexor tendon cause fully understood . Many treatment propose review perform Cochrane collaboration find firm evidence support : 1 . Surgical decompression carpal tunnel . 2 . Steroid therapy ( local injection systemic administration ) . 3 . Neutral angle wrist splint . None available evidence base treatment CTS entirely satisfactory . Splinting partially effective success rate 34 % , Steroid injection follow frequent relapse remain uncertainty safety serial injection . Surgery result small significant incidence permanent morbidity complication . Any demonstrably effective safe addition therapeutic option would significant advance . Of many candidate treatment , therapeutic ultrasound present appear promise therefore subject proposal Therapeutic ultrasound good safety record essentially non-invasive . In trial , patient mild carpal tunnel syndrome , confirm nerve conduction study , give wrist splint . They randomly allocate either real sham ultrasound therapy ( 20 session 7 week ) follow 1 year . The effect treatment symptom assess use validated questionnaire nerve conduction study repeat completion ultrasound treatment 7th week 6 12 month time . This randomise , double blind , single-centre , clinical trial conduct East Kent Hospitals University Foundation Trusts ( Kent Canterbury Hospital ) , follow-up 1 year completion treatment . Following randomisation , patient require attend clinic 20 session 7 week period ( 5x weekly 2 week 2x weekly 5 week ) .</detailed_description>
