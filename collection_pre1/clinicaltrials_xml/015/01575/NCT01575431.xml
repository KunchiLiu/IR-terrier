	<detailed_description>Research stem cell identify population bone marrow-derived cell , call circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , incorporate site neovascularization home site endothelial denudation thus contribute maintenance vascular homeostasis . Although extensive work conduct verify EPCs impairment play key role coronary atherogenesis , still matter debate extension severity coronary artery disease associate reduce increased number EPCs , remain unclear cell exert favorable unfavorable effect sit percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . One consider , however , previous investigation hamper discordant definition EPCs different timing EPCs sampling , thus determine much uncertainty role EPCs restenosis atherosclerosis progression . Furthermore , development de novo lesion post-PCI restenosis , pathophysiologically dissimilar , examine concomitantly serially time . Accordingly , aim study carry first prospective assessment significance subpopulation circulate EPCs subsequent occurrence restenosis progression coronary atherosclerosis PCI . To end , pool EPCs subtypes suggest play role atherosclerosis measure homogenous population candidate PCI . At variance previous work , count EPCs obtain baseline condition PCI order avoid confound effect procedure exert EPCs .</detailed_description>
