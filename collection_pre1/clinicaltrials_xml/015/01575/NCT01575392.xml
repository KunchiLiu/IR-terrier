	<brief_summary>In clinical practice 24-hour creatinine clearance often use obtain impression renal function . However , glomerular filtration rate consider best indicator renal function . For practical financial purpose , GFR often estimate mean serum creatinine base equation . These equation also use internation guideline define classify chronic kidney disease . Therefore , accurate creatinine measurement important make reliable estimate renal function . However , previous research reveal large variability creatinine measurement use different measure method . In study investigator aim establish degree variability different method measure creatinine heterogenous group Caucasian people without renal function loss influence variability renal function estimate equation 24-hour creatinine clearance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Apart 24-hour creatinine clearance , also formulas estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) increasingly use get impression renal function recent year . Based renal function measurement , clinical decision make well drug dose adjustment . The use reliable serum creatinine measurement therefore important get accurate renal function estimate . However , serum creatinine one variable routine laboratory test . The importance calibration traceable reference measurement serum creatinine stress . However , standardization correct analytical non-specificity problem , occur certain technique measure creatinine , lead under- overestimation true creatinine concentration . The aim cross-sectional observational study examine degree variability diverse method measure creatinine plasma urine heterogenous group Caucasian people without renal function loss influence hereof 24-hour creatinine clearance Modification Diet Renal Disease study equation consequence chronic kidney disease staging .</detailed_description>
