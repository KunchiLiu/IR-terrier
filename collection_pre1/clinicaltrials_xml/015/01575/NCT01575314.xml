	<brief_title>Cost-consequence Analysis Parenchymal Stapling Device Versus Hand-sewing Pulmonary Lobectomy Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many lung disease need surgical treatment include malignancy lesion benign lesion lung bleb bulla , lung cyst , benign tumor , infection ( necrotizing pneumonia , lung abscess , aspergilloma ) etc . One common procedure pulmonary lobectomy . The surgical method divide parenchyma perform lobectomy divide two method . In past , investigator use hand-sewn technique procedure time-consuming , high risk air leakage , infection re-operation , long length hospital stay high total cost treatment . In present time , investigator use staple device use worldwide various field surgery since 1995 . Many study prove use staple device reduce post-operative complication , length hospital stay total cost treatment also become standard instrument lung surgery . In Thailand , device use least 5 year include Health Insurance Thai Government . Many patient pay device , approximately 323-484.5 USD . Therefore , investigator try prove hypothesis use staple device lung surgery would reduce cost treatment , post-operative air leakage , re-operative rate , length hospital stay time surgery . The result study may effect decision include device Health Insurance Thai Government .</detailed_description>
