	<brief_title>Saline Irrigation After Surgery Patients With Chronic Sinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic Rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common inflammatory condition upper respiratory tract last 8 12 week . Major symptom include facial congestion/fullness , facial pain/pressure , nasal obstruction/blockage , purulent nasal drainage , reduction loss smell . The diagnosis must include two major symptom either endoscopic evidence polyp , edema mucopurulent discharge middle meatus and/or CT change mucosa sinus osteomeatal complexes.1 CRS estimate prevalence 5 % Canadian population2 , 16 % adult population United States.3 Sinusitis associate major societal health care burden , cost billion dollar year North America.4,5 The medical treatment CRS include topical saline corticosteroid spray , systemic steroid antimicrobial . Specifically , saline nasal irrigation ( SNI ) safe , nonpharmacologic treatment , important efficacious component management CRS.6,7 SNI vary concentration ( e.g . hypertonic , isotonic , hypotonic ) device ( e.g . bulb syringe , nasal mist , squeeze bottle ) . The Mayo Clinic recently review major expert consensus guideline medical treatment CRS.8 Although recognize overall paucity control trial medical treatment , lack consensus algorithm treatment CRS , overall consensus agreement use SNI population . In review , mention treatment CRS postoperative period , recommendation type SNI best . Few study examine various SNI formulation postoperative period . These highlight Canadian author recent exhaustive review SNI sinusitis.9 Three study , great 15 year old , include formulation currently popular use , even available North America.10-12 These show pressurize jet spray seawater effective nasal drop . More recently , Harvey et al . examine irrigation deliver retain sinus , use common devices.13,14 In cadaveric model , compare HVSI LVSI device find great delivery ( p &lt; ..02 ) former . To date study compare HVSI LVSI , use subjective patient benefit objective endoscopic measure outcomes , postoperative CRS patient . One study examine two different SNI device management CRS.15 The author recruit 150 subject CRS primary care setting , randomize two week SNI bulb syringe , SNI nasal irrigation pot , control group reflexology massage.15 Hypertonic saline use treatment group . Subjective questionnaire administer baseline end study period . Both group significantly improve , significant difference two SNI device . Patients equally prefer two device . Popular HVSI LVSI formulation patient physician NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ Salinex® , respectively . These two example positive pressure treatments,13 enjoy widespread usage North America precede sufficient evidence-based medicine demonstrate safety efficacy . This likely topical saline spray consider safe ; require prescription , perhaps importantly massive marketing campaign surround SNI device . SNI device receive significant news coverage appearance major television show , include Oprah Winfrey Show , New York Times , numerous YouTube videos.16 Purpose : The author hypothesize advantage HVSI LVSI . The mechanical effect high volume irrigation help ensure large surface area sinonasal mucosa debrided cleanse . The aim study determine clinical benefit HVSI LVSI postoperative period patient CRS . This information would help otolaryngologist , family physician , health care professional recommend best SNI device patient CRS . It would also provide much-needed prospective control trial evidence SNI CRS post-operative period . Population/Procedure : This multicenter , randomize , single blind , control prospective study evaluate subjective objective outcome HSVI versus LSVI patient ESS CRS . One month postoperative score compare preoperative score . The expected total number patient enrol study approximately 100 , plan completion time one year . At institution , ten patient offer endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) CRS approach study participation .</detailed_description>
