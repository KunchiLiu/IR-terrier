	<brief_summary>This double-blinded , randomize , safety , acceptability , pharmacokinetic , ex vivo efficacy study three rectally-applied tenofovir-based microbicide formulation . Approximately 18 total evaluable HIV-negative men woman ( ~9 per site ) enrol across two study site : University California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Magee-Womens Research Institute ( MWRI ) University Pittsburgh . Each participant experience seven rectal exposure rectal-specific formulation ( RF ) seven rectal exposure reduce glycerin vaginal formulation ( RGVF ) tenofovir 1 % gel , one exposure vaginal formulation ( VF ) , couple six precede exposure Universal HEC Placebo Gel balance VF study stage . Participant accrual take approximately 6 month participant study approximately 3 month . The total duration study approximately 1 year . The primary objective study safety , acceptability , pharmacokinetics , specifically : - To evaluate safety tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation apply rectally - To evaluate acceptability tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation apply rectally - To compare systemic compartment pharmacokinetics among three tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation apply rectally Secondary objective study evaluate mucosal immunotoxicity tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation apply rectally . And exploratory objective study ass preliminary ( ex vivo ) efficacy tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation use biopsy explants product apply rectally .</brief_summary>
