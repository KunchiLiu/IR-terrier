	<brief_summary>Internal jugular vein ( IJV ) catheterization frequently perform infant undergo major surgery . Although suggested head rotation increase degree overlap IJV carotid artery ( CA ) , IJV catheterization without head rotation extremely difficult infant . The aim present study evaluate whether caudo-lateral traction ipsilateral arm decrease degree overlap IJV CA infant head rotation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central venous catheterization frequently perform pediatric patient undergo major surgery fluid management vasoactive drug therapy . Compared subclavian vein , internal jugular vein ( IJV ) generally prefer catheterization low incidence serious complication , pneumothorax hemothorax . However , especially infant , IJV catheterization still technically difficult small size vein anatomical variation . In previous study , ultrasound guidance keep neutral head position recommend increase success rate decrease overlap carotid artery ( CA ) IJV , respectively . However , device ultrasonography always available . Moreover , IJV catheterization without head rotation could extremely difficult infant relative large skull small neck adult . Therefore , simple method relieve overlap CA IJV would need . During head rotation contralateral side , cephalic part IJV move direction . Accordingly , investigator think counter traction caudal part IJV use caudo-lateral traction ipsilateral arm might relieve overlap cause head rotation . Therefore , investigator evaluate effect caudo-lateral traction ipsilateral arm overlap common CA IJV infant .</detailed_description>
