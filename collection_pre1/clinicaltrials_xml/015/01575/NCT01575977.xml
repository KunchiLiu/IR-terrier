	<detailed_description>PAO design joint preserve surgical procedure compensate shallow acetabulum re-orienting acetabulum position provide good coverage femoral head . Although overall theory increase load bearing area ( improve coverage femoral head ) result reduce joint stress intuitive , complex bony surface may behave manner . It possible joint stress may increase acetabulum reoriented position increase load bear area post-operative joint congruency bad pre-operative .</detailed_description>
