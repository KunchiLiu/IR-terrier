	<brief_summary>This study prospective , double-blinded , randomize comparison 2 patient cohort . One group patient receive transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block . The second group receive local anesthetic infiltration inject surgical site surgeon end surgery laparoscopic appendectomy . The purpose study prospectively compare post-operative pain relief pediatric patient undergo laparoscopic appendectomy receive either transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block local anesthetic infiltration surgeon analgesia compare appropriate delivery effective analgesia . In effort improve postoperative analgesia limit opioid-related adverse effect , continue increase use multimodal techniques infant child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) Versus Local Anesthetic Lap Appendectomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The literature clearly demonstrate effective treatment postoperative pain infant child challenge . Despite recognition importance postoperative analgesia potential adverse effect postoperative pain , significant pain occur postoperative period inpatient outpatient setting . Specifically , appendectomy one common pediatric surgical procedure associate significant postoperative pain . Additionally , although use opioid analgesic generally safe , adverse effect occur thereby mandate use alternative analgesic technique feasible . In effort improve postoperative analgesia limit opioid-related adverse effect , continue increase use multimodal techniques infant child . These include TAP block well wound infiltration local anesthetic . The efficacy TAP block set laparoscopic appendectomy demonstrate adult pediatric population , however efficacy comparison local anesthetic infiltration unclear . The TAP block first describe McDonnell et al . 2004 pain control procedures involve anterior abdominal wall . The skin , muscle , parietal peritoneum region innervate T7 L1 nerve root . The author describe deposition local anesthetic plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle terminal branch T7 L1 nerve lie . Since , TAP block show effectively provide analgesia variety abdominal procedure . In 2007 ultrasound guide approach describe Hebbard et al . subsequent study conclude ultrasound guide TAP block provide superior analgesia blind technique . The frequency surgical appendectomy inpatient surgical well ambulatory set justifies comparison effective analgesia . This study certainly change daily practice pediatric anesthesiologist provide optimal care patient family satisfaction , well recovery .</detailed_description>
