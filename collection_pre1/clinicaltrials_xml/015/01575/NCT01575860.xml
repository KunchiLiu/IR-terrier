	<brief_summary>This study conduct evaluate overall safety lenalidomide ( also know Revlimid ) patient lymphoma , determine whether effective prevent disease return stem cell transplant . This study also determine dose lenalidomide give without cause severe side effect . Lenalidomide approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment lymphoma . At least 28 people enrol study University Pennsylvania .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Describe succinctly clearly past finding justify plan project . A summary relevant literature area interest report previous study include . For majority lymphoma patient relapse complete response primary refractory initial treatment , combination salvage chemotherapy follow high dose chemotherapy ASCT consider standard care . Sensitivity salvage chemotherapy affect outcome ASCT . Traditionally , response salvage chemotherapy prior ASCT determine conventional compute tomography ( CT ) scan use size criterion . In past several year , show functional imaging PET scan use fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) provide additional information anatomic imaging CTs . Recently , PET scan incorporate response assessment publish Imaging Subcommittee International Harmonization Project Lymphoma . These day , institution use PET/CT scan incorporate functional imaging PET scan fuse low dose non-contrast enhance CT scan . We previously report outcome patient relapsed/refractory lymphomas continue residual FDG avid PET ( positive ) lesion salvage chemotherapy prior ASCT . This group patient include excellent anatomic response size criterion , continue persistent hypermetabolic FDG activity within residual lesion . We find PET positive patient extremely poor chance durable remission ASCT . In PET negative group , median PFS 19 month 54 % patient without progression 12 month ASCT . In PET positive group , median PFS 5 month 7 % patient without progression 12 month ASCT . We conclude , patient PET positive residual disease salvage chemotherapy prior ASCT , novel therapeutic approach agent need investigate . Lenalidomide proprietary IMiD® compound Celgene Corporation . IMiD® compound immunomodulatory anti-angiogenic property could confer antitumor antimetastatic effect . Although exact antitumor mechanism action lenalidomide unknown , number mechanism postulate responsible lenalidomides activity hematological malignancy . Lenalidomide demonstrate possess anti-angiogenic activity inhibition bFGF , VEGF TNF-alpha induce endothelial cell migration , due least part inhibition Akt phosphorylation response bFGF . In addition , lenalidomide variety immunomodulatory effect . Lenalidomide stimulate T cell proliferation , production IL-2 , IL-10 IFN-gamma , inhibit IL-1 beta IL-6 modulate IL-12 production . Up-regulation T cell derive IL-2 production achieve least part increase AP-1 activity . The increased level circulate cytokine augment natural killer cell number function , enhance natural killer cell activity . Clinical activity lenalidomide various lymphoma subtypes document several phase II trial . In patient relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma , overall response rate ( ORR ) 53 % PFS 12 month 40 % . In patient aggressive lymphoma ( mostly diffuse large B-cell subtype ) , ORR 35 % PFS 12 month 25 % . There also many case report patient achieve durable complete response lenalidomide fail multiple cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen . Most clinical study lenalidomide patient active lymphoma use dose 25 mg daily day 1-21 28 day cycle dose recommend active multiple myeloma . While lenalidomide well tolerate lymphoma study , dose 25 mg associate high risk develop cytopenia include grade 3 neutropenia 25-40 % patient thrombocytopenia 12-20 % . Our group report low dose lenalidomide 10 mg daily ( continuous dose ) combination weekly dexamethasone effective patient active relapsed/refractory low grade mantle cell lymphoma . The continuous dose 10 mg daily also use treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma . Lenalidomide use maintenance therapy multiple myeloma , limited experience maintenance lenalidomide lymphoma patient . Two large clinical trial maintenance lenalidomide patient multiple myeloma ASCT show benefit PFS observation . These study use daily dose lenalidomide 10 mg 15 mg well tolerate long term administration . Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) currently indicate treatment patient transfusion-dependent anemia due Low- Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality without additional cytogenetic abnormality . Revlimid® also approve combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . The frequently report adverse event report clinical study lenalidomide oncologic non-oncologic indication , regardless presume relationship study medication include : anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia pancytopenia , abdominal pain , nausea , vomit diarrhea , dehydration , rash , itching , infection , sepsis , pneumonia , UTI , Upper respiratory infection , atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , chest pain , weakness , hypotension , hypercalcemia , hyperglycemia , back pain , bone pain , generalize pain , dizziness , mental status change , syncope , renal failure , dyspnea , pleural effusion , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , CVA , convulsion , dizziness , spinal cord compression , syncope , disease progression , death specify fracture . Complete update adverse event available Investigational Drug Brochure IND Safety Letters . Rationale Treatment Setting : Our previously report data similar study institution indicate patient PET positive lesion salvage chemotherapy prior ASCT poorly . In study , patient residual PET positive lesion ASCT median PFS 5 month 7 % patient without progression 12 month ASCT . It speculate patient PET positive lesion prior ASCT harbor chemotherapy resistant lymphoma cell tumor . Since mechanism action lenalidomide differs traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy , use novel agent group patient attractive concept . The immunomodulary property lenalidomide maintenance period 24 month could improve overall outcome patient follow ASCT . Since valid concern lenalidomide could cause severe cytopenia use early ASCT , propose administer dose 10 mg lenalidomide daily option dose modification 5 mg daily accord previously define toxicity criterion . The daily maintenance dose lenalidomide 10 mg use patient multiple myeloma ASCT improve PFS two large randomize trial .</detailed_description>
