	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Who Have No Evidence Disease After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease-free survival pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) compare placebo , define time randomization development recurrent disease , second primary cancer ( localize breast , localized prostate , non-melanoma skin cancer ) death cause patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) evidence disease follow metastasectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe overall survival patient advance RCC randomly assign receive placebo pazopanib one year follow metastasectomy evidence disease ( NED ) . II . To describe treatment ( recurrence ) disease-related adverse event two treatment arm . III . To analyze quality-adjusted time without symptom disease treatment ( Q-TWiST ) subject two treatment arm . IV . To characterize change patient-reported fatigue ( recurrence ) kidney cancer-related symptom follow treatment pazopanib compare placebo . V. To explore association plasma trough level pazopanib disease-free overall survival . VI . To prospectively bank preserve tissue primary tumor associate metastatic site patient RCC . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1of 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month first two year , every 6 month next 3 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
