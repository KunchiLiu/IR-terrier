	<detailed_description>1 . Why study ? 1.1 . Significance difficulty problem address . Aortic stenosis encounter valvular disease According 2007 ESC guideline ( 1 ) , moderate aortic stenosis ( AS ) define valve area 1.0-1.5 cm² ( 0.6 cm²/m² 0.9 cm²/m² body surface area ( BSA ) ) mean aortic gradient 30-50 mmHg presence normal flow condition . We already know treat patient severe AS , symptomatic . On contrary , patient moderate AS clear agreement reduce excess mortality ( detail ) . Why patient die reduce mortality rate ? 1.2 . Originality propose solution appropriateness objective . There already progression factor spectrum AS highlight ( discuss ) could influence mortality patient subgroup , none study address exclusively moderate AS . The majority study major limitation , prospective , even , parameter follow cover complete cardiological investigational tool ( 3D leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction ( EF ) , strain , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , etc. ) . As major disease , lots study include moderate AS contradictory matter ( see progression AS ) . We aim identify clinical , biological , echo imagistic parameter predispose increased progression rate prospective randomize trial include ONLY patient moderate AS , investigational tool provide 2012 . Once parameter find , medical interventional treatment could implement decrease mortality rate . But first , data survival death moderate AS . I would like start paraphrase one passionate researcher field aortic stenosis , C. Otto ( 2 ) : `` even mild disease important '' ( refer course outcome patient mild AS ) . Similarly , people moderate AS/ aortic sclerosis , even mention moderate severe AS ( 3 ) increase death rate comparison age-matched healthy population . The author report 1999 result prospective study ( 4 ) follow-up ( FU ) 5 year observe cardiac death rate 6.1 % general population ( normal aortic valve ) , 10.1 % patient aortic sclerosis 19.6 % patient AS . In 2004 Rosenhek et al . ( 5 ) find cardiac death rate 8.7 % population mean age 67 year , moderate AS initial examination . Even though large study ( 6 ) evaluate medical treatment moderate AS reported cardiac death rate 6.0 % ( similar general population ) , consider study eloquent super-selected population enrol ( investigator rule important progression factor AS : exclusion criterion include history coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , stroke diabetes mellitus ( DM ) ) . 2 . Trials involve patient moderate AS . In presentation review discus outcomes severe AS , ONLY outcomes patient MODERATE AS . The first step research identification study involve moderate AS . We observe study include ONLY patient moderate AS . At opposite , large majority study include moderate AS among spectrum AS patient ( sclerosis , mild , moderate , severe- alone combine ) . That categorize previous study regard moderate AS baseline inclusion criterion . We find 4 major group enrol patient review discussed : patient mild moderate AS ( Table 1 ) ( 5-10 ) , patient moderate AS ( Table 2 ) ( 11-12 ) , patient mild , moderate severe AS ( Table 3 ) ( 13-20 ) patient moderate severe AS ( Table 4 ) ( 21-27 ) . Even though essential data regard moderate AS easily read table ( patient characteristic , progression moderate AS , outcomes , survival , limitation conclusion ) even though progression factor summed-up , great importance result echo study recently publish I would like briefly discus . Monin et al . enrol 107 patient baseline peak velocity ( PV ) 3.5 4.4 m/s ( 26 ) , conclude female sex , PV brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) baseline correlate AS progression develop score best stratify outcomes patient ( see Table 4 limitation ) . Marechaux et al . ( 27 ) include 135 patient least moderate AS ( 53 % severe AS ) , normal stress test baseline . Increased progression present rest mean gradient ( MG ) &gt; 35 mmHg exercise-induced increase MG &gt; 20 mmHg ( see Table 4 limitation ) . Two study try clarify role strain AS . One study show strain gradually decreased severity AS increase global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) might useful assess subtle change LV function patient mild , moderate severe AS ( 17 ) . In second study , Ng et al . ( 19 ) find longitudinal , radial circumferential strain strain rate ( SR ) deteriorate aortic valve disease progression . Important limitation study find Table 3 . 3 . Progression AS . There wide variability AS progression . Progression rate ( PV ) begin 0.15±0.01 m/s/y population without cardiovascular risk factor ( 6 ) increase 0.34±0.42 m/s/y patient CAD , reach 0.45±0.38 m/s/y patient cardiovascular event ( 5 ) . High progressors least one abnormal parameter following : echocardiography parameter : baseline PV ( 3 , 12 , 5 , 10 , 16 , 20 , 26 ) , baseline peak gradient ( 24 ) , mean gradient ( 3 ) , rate increase PV ( 3 , 20 ) , moderate severe aortic valve calcification echo ( 5 , 12 ) , LV hypertrophy ( 27 ) , rest MG &gt; 35 mmHg ( 27 ) , exercise-induced increase MG &gt; 20 mmHg ( 27 ) , E velocity ( 16 ) , bicuspid aortic valve ( 16 ) ; clinical predictor : CAD ( 5 , 21 ) , age ( &gt; 80 years-8 , 12 , 18 , 20 , &gt; 64 years-21 , &gt; 65years-27 ) , diabetes ( 14 , 27 ) , metabolic syndrome ( MS ) ( 24 ) , dialysis ( 28 , 29 ) , increase BMI ( 7 ) , functional status ( 3 ) , history smoking ( 7 , 30 ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ( 18 , 30 ) , male gender ( 24 , 30 ) , female gender ( 26 ) ; biological parameter : parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level ( 18 ) , BNP baseline ( 26 ) , high lipoprotein ( ) ( Lp ( ) ) low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level ( 30 ) . No influence AS progression treatment simvastatin ezetimibe ( 6 ) , elprenone ( 25 ) rosuvastatin ( 9 ) statin ( 14 ) . Slower progression observe osteoporosis ( 11 ) bisphosphonate treatment ( 15 ) , study either small , retrospective ( 11 , 15 ) bias ( 11 ) . Geographical difference evident two paper show Korean patient progress slow western population ( 12 , 16 ) . Data regard role C-reactive protein AS progression controversial ( 10 , 13 ) . We discuss old study small series patient AS , era cardiac catheterization ( 31-36 ) , early echo decade ( 37-41 ) . Their capability address subject limit retrospective design case , potential selection bias , limited clinical , functional , exercise data , availability two data point per patient , lack factor predict rate hemodynamic progression clinical outcome . 4 . Incidence AS . Degenerative aortic valve disease evolve slowly aortic sclerosis aortic stenosis . Aortic sclerosis stenosis find 29 % 2-9 % respectively adults old 65 year ( 4 ) . In 5,201 subject &gt; 65 year , aortic valve sclerosis present 26 % AS 2 % entire study cohort ; subject &gt; 75 year age , sclerosis present 37 % stenosis 2.6 % ( 30 ) . The prevalence critical AS 2.9 % group 75 86 year age another study ( 42 ) . In observational study ( 43 ) enrol 953 subject ( age 25-74 year ) , overall prevalence degenerative aortic valve disease ( define presence valvular sclerosis , calcification , thicken echocardiographical examination ) 28 % . The prevalence degenerative aortic valve disease age group follow : 7 % ( 35-44 year ) , 19 % ( 45-54 ) , 30 % ( 55-64 ) , 38 % ( 65-74 ) 64 % ( 75-84 ) . There significant difference men woman . Clinical factor associate AS similar associate CAD ( 3 , 44 ) . Even though several small non-randomized study ( 45 , 46-49 ) suggest beneficial effect statin , three prospective randomize study find effect lipid-lowering therapy progression aortic-valve stenosis .
