	<brief_summary>This study non-intervention , clinical study test `` research use '' APAP protein adduct dipstick human blood sample . The study conduct two phase . In phase 1 , research use dipsticks dipstick test component test feasibility emergency department UAMS . Patients enrol acetaminophen level obtain part medical evaluation . In phase 2 , research use dipsticks test center participate Acute Liver Failure Study Group ( ALFSG ) , clinical research network fund National Institutes Diabetes , Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) . Subjects participate clinical registry ALFSG approach enrollment . These patient diagnosis acute liver failure acute liver injury variety etiology , include APAP . A single blood sample obtain aliquoted 1 ) test dipstick 2 ) test high performance liquid chromatography electrochemical detection ( HPLC-EC ) analysis APAP protein adduct . APAP level also determine second aliquot blood . In Phase 1 Phase 2 , dipstick read manually dipstick reader independent tester directly involve clinical care patient . The result two dipstick reading record , remain confidential use diagnosis management patient . The result dipsticks HPLC-EC assay compare final patient diagnosis .</brief_summary>
