	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate benefit Closed-loop System Oxygen Delivery ( FreeO2 ) compare fix oxygen flow endurance shuttle walking test patient Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , oxygen therapy hypercapnia . The study design test follow hypothesis : As compare fix oxygen flow , FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system lead high exercise tolerance ( distance ESWT ) low desaturation event without increase hypercapnia patient COPD , oxygen therapy hypercapnia . As compare fix oxygen flow , FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system lead low dyspnea leg fatigue score give endurance time shuttle walk test patient COPD , oxygen therapy hypercapnia . As compare fix oxygen flow , FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system lead low cardiac respiratory frequency give endurance time shuttle walk test patient COPD , oxygen therapy hypercapnia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed-loop System Oxygen Delivery Exercise Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In spite oxygen therapy , desaturations frequently occur exercise COPD patient . Although current recommendation add 1 L/min baseline oxygen flow exertion , new closed-loop system ( FreeO2 ) automatically continuously adjust oxygen flow patient 's need base oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) , end-tidal CO2 ( EtCO2 ) respiratory rate . A preliminary study show significant improvement exercise tolerance COPD patient need oxygen therapy . Although oxygen flow could two fold increase exercise , worsen hypercapnia plausible severe COPD . Aim study evaluate system endurance shuttle walk test COPD patient oxygen therapy hypercapnia . Methods : The investigator propose conduct control , randomize cross-over study compare efficacy Closed-loop System Oxygen Delivery ( FreeO2 ) compare fix oxygen flow endurance shuttle walking test patient COPD , oxygen therapy hypercapnia .</detailed_description>
