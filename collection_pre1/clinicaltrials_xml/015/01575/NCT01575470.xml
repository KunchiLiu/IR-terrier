	<brief_title>Treatment Severe Adult Traumatic Brain Injury Using Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) contribute 50 % trauma death . The mortality rate adult follow severe TBI ( Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9 ) estimate 33 % . There currently therapy reverse primary injury associate TBI . Over past 10 year grow body literature support use various progenitor cell type treat acute neurological injury TBI stroke . Neural stem cell ( adult embryonic ) , mesenchymal stromal multipotent adult progenitor cell , bone marrow mononuclear cell ( MSC MAPCs derive ) show efficacy pre-clinical model TBI/stroke various mechanism ; however , group believe true neural replacement integration putative mechanism involve observed efficacy . More likely progenitor cell population modify regional response injury ( inflammatory/reparative vs. regenerative ) , result improve functional outcome . Our primary hypothesis bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMMNC ) autologous transplantation TBI safe ( harvest infusion relate toxicity ) TBI . Our secondary hypothesis functional outcome measure improve BMMNC infusion , ( 3 ) BMMNC infusion reduce BBB permeability , ( 4 ) BMMNC neuroprotective preserve grey matter white matter volume TBI . Patients , ages18 55 year old , admitted Memorial Hermann Hospital Trauma Center Glasgow Coma Scores ( GCS ) 5 8 screen . Those patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion ( Legal Authorized Representative [ LAR ] ) offer consent participate . This dose-escalation study consist 4 cohort include control group ( 5 subjects/cohort ) . The first five subject undergo bone marrow harvest procedure ; though follow treat study participant complete follow-up procedure . Subjects 6-10 receive low dose target 6X106 mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight . Subjects 11-15 receive 9x106 mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight , lastly Subjects 16-20 receive 12X106 mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight . The study NOT power detect functional measure efficacy . However , estimate make regard potential treatment effect size allow rational power analyse follow-on Phase II study . This study determine bone marrow harvest , BMMNC separation , reinfusion safe adult acute , severe TBI .</detailed_description>
