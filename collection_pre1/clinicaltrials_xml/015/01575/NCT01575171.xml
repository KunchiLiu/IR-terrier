	<brief_summary>Behavioral economics represent powerful , albeit underutilized tool influence provider system behavior large-scale , meaningful , sustainable way . The investigator propose use sophisticated electronic health record ( EHR ) system change default choice physician choice support clinical practice guideline ( CPG ) . Multiple guideline exist describe best practice effective intervention , yet large gap persist actual optimal guideline compliance . The propose study examine comparative effectiveness opt-out medication management protocol relative usual care patient goal , use national guideline cholesterol management implement large multispecialty private practice use Electronic Health Record system . Specific Aim : To determine effectiveness alter default option EHR prescribing statin select patient use clinical decision support . Hypotheses : Compared usual care , CPG-concordant intervention design use behavioral economics principle significantly improve proportion patient prescribed statin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Nudges Implement Comparative Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , many intervention study improve quality , safety , effectiveness medical care , particularly new focus comparative effectiveness research . Unfortunately , sustain provider system uptake intervention severely lack , serious detriment patient health . The commonly tried tool increase uptake , include pay-for-performance , substantially fall short expectation . Moreover , often intervention create highly artificial setting , come way implement long-term . The challenge , therefore , create sustainable change impact care meaningful way . In contrast , behavioral economics represent powerful tool influence provider system behavior large-scale , meaningful , sustainable way . Briefly , behavioral economics recognizes individual often fully `` rational '' purely economic sense , subject influence various social , environmental cognitive factor decision making . And , one take advantage finding `` nudge '' individual , case physician , towards optimal choice . While application behavioral economics incredibly successful alter behavior outside health sphere , surprisingly little attention give health . We choose focus physician behavior prescribe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) patient elevate cardiac risk elevate low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) recommend cholesterol management guideline . In cluster randomize trial several private , community-based , multispecialty practice , propose compare usual care system automate , default , opt-out clinical decision support prescribes statin appropriate . We propose use cluster randomize trial design several multispecialty private practice examine comparative effectiveness EHR-based lipid management protocol base ATP III guideline vs. usual care . Cluster randomization participate physician useful blind impossible `` contamination '' might problem , i.e . aggressive management among physician 's non-intervention patient result experience intervention patient . Of estimate 150 primary care physician recruit private practice , expect least 100 consent participate . Physicians cluster randomization base number patient panel meet ATP III guideline statin . Physicians cluster individually randomize intervention control arm . Physicians randomize usual care get intervention decision support . Physicians randomize automated clinical decision support `` nudge '' see new `` optout '' prescribe procedure part EHR interface . This include initially prescribe guideline-based medication , simvastatin 20mg . Nearly six month visit , physician receive reminder via EHR schedule follow-up fasting lipid profile recommend ATP III guideline .</detailed_description>
