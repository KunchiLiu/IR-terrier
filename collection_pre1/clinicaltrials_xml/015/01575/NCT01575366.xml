	<brief_summary>Aim 1 . Determine whether higher-velocity finger track train improves hand function slow velocity training . Working hypothesis : The higher-velocity training significantly great functional improvement compare lower-velocity training , measure standardized upper extremity functional test ( Jebsen Taylor test , Box &amp; Block Test , Finger extension force test ) Aim 2 . Ascertain whether higher-velocity finger track train differentially induce cortical reorganization compare lower-velocity finger track training . Working hypothesis : The higher-velocity training significantly great cortical reorganization compare lower-velocity training , measure : 1 . TMS - increase amplitude motor evoke potential ( MEP ) paretic extensor digitorum muscle response paired-pulse TMS ipsilesional primary motor area ( M1 ) . 2. fMRI - increased volume activation , signal intensity , laterality ipsilesional M1 . Aim 3 . Explore whether functional improvement correlate cortical reorganization . Working hypothesis : The functional improvement correlate cortical reorganization .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion include : Ischemic stroke due high risk seizure hemorrhagic stroke Subcortical location stroke Stroke 6 month low limit 6 month avoid confound spontaneous recovery ( Jorgensen , Nakayama et al . 1995 ) upper limit maximize pool candidate subject still show train effect ( Carey , Kimberley et al . 2002 ) At least 18 year age maximize pool candidate subject MiniMental State Examination score &gt; 24 ensure satisfactory cognition perform task Satisfactory correct vision see computer screen train test Active range MP joint paretic index finger least 10 degree base minimal movement require perform training task successfully , large amplitude would reduce pool subject available participate study . Ability pronate forearm index finger extension movement train vertically upward relaxation result finger fall back flex start position currently receive therapy avoid confound treatment effect Approval participation neurologist ensure subject reasonably safe receive TMS testing . Subjects proprioceptive loss expressive aphasia include , provide carryout train task . Exclusion criterion include : Inability follow 3step command A visual field cut cause subject see indicator computer screen position centrally History seizure Family member history seizure Presence neuromuscular disorder Pregnancy Claustrophobia Indwelling metal medical devices/implants incompatible functional fMRI test History exposure finger track training . Informed consent obtain TMS/fMRI safety screening conduct prior test procedure . Subjects recruit volunteer letter send previous research subject invite participation , visit local stroke support group meeting , newspaper advertisement referral neurologist .</criteria>
