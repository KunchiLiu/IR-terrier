	<brief_title>Tivantinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate activity tivantinib ( ARQ-197 ) define 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) participants triple-negative metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . II . To evaluate c-Met phospho c-Met expression archival tumor tissue . ( Exploratory ) III . To evaluate incidence c-Met-positive circulate tumor cell baseline . ( Exploratory ) IV . To evaluate effect ARQ-197 serum marker relevant c-Met pathway ( hepatocyte growth factor [ HGF ] vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] ) . ( Exploratory ) V. To evaluate phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss PI3K mutation archival tumor tissue . ( Exploratory ) VI . To evaluate proportion participant basal-like breast cancer . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study c-Met expression , relevant marker ( HGF VEGF ) , PTEN loss , PI3K mutation analysis fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Archived tumor tissue sample also analyze . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
