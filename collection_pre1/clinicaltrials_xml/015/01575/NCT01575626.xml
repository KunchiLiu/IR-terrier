	<detailed_description>One important goal anesthetic management ocular surgery provide adequate control intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . An increase IOP may catastrophic patient glaucoma penetrate open-eye injury . There ongoing debate effect anesthetic agent IOP . Anesthetic regimens surgical field commonly consist short-acting anesthetic agent , propofol sevoflurane , usually combine short-acting analgesic , remifentanil . Both propofol sevoflurane know reduce IOP . Previous study compare two anesthetic protocol order determine provide superior control IOP . Propofol produce significantly low IOP measurement compare sevoflurane ( combine remifentanil ) , cataract surgery , whereas non-ophthalmic surgery propofol sevoflurane cause comparable decrease IOP . Sevoflurane , inhalational anesthetic , rapid onset action faster recovery time also suitable inhalation induction irritate airway . A prospective randomize clinical trial compare effect ketamine sevoflurane IOP eight minute induction anesthesia ( 2-minute interval ) child suspect diagnosed glaucoma undergo EUA . During 8 minute IOP decrease significantly sevoflurane group . This finding contradict claim measurement immediately induction relatively unaffected anesthetic suggest variation sevoflurane concentration affect IOP . Yoshitake et al show remarkable reduction IOP induction probably cause induction agent , suggest sevoflurane useful anesthetic elderly patient receive ophthalmic surgery . To end data literature support disprove finding . Study Hypothesis Variations end-tidal sevoflurane concentration significant effect IOP .</detailed_description>
