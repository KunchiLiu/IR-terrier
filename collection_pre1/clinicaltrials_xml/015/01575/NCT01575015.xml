	<brief_summary>Patient liver failure wait liver transplantation often hospitalize commonly support intensive care unit prior surgery . These patient sick , addition complication fail liver , organs kidney often fail well . As consequence , patient increase risk complication relate kidney failure liver transplantation procedure . One potential method diminish risk complication provide dialysis support patient liver transplantation operate theater form continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) . While increasingly perform theoretically appeal , little information support practice . In addition , use CRRT surgery entirely without risk . The investigator perform two preliminary study use CRRT liver transplantation data would strongly support need conduct higher-quality study well evaluate feasibility , safety usefulness . Our propose study randomize trial compare use CRRT surgery standard supportive care sick patient liver failure schedule receive liver transplantation .</brief_summary>
