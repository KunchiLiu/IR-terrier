	<brief_title>Nasal High-flow Versus Venturi Mask Oxygen Therapy Post-extubation Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure one common reason admission mechanical ventilation frequent procedure perform intensive care unit ( ICU ) . After extubation , oxygen therapy commonly use correct residual impairment oxygenation . Oxygen therapy usually perform via Venturi mask allow deliver predetermine oxygen concentration . The face mask use place nasal cannula part patient acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) breath preferentially open mouth rather nose . The mask may , however , reduce comfort patient ARF , often agitate poorly cooperative , may displace self-remove mask . Given oxygen deliver patient dry , clinical practice guideline recommend humidify oxygen 4 l/min ICU setting , humidification function nasal mucosa insufficient high oxygen flow rate and/or critically ill patient ARF often breathe mouth . Breathing dry oxygen could provoke dryness mouth , nose , throat respiratory tract , result discomfort pain frequent ICU setting . Breathing dry air nose may also lead alteration mucociliary transport system cause increase airway resistance healthy subject . However , recommendation concern type humidification device use . High-flow oxygen therapy commonly practice ICU . Recently , method describe high-flow oxygen deliver nasal cannula active humidification system optimize oxygen administration patient ARF ( Optiflow , Fisher &amp; Paykel , New Zealand ) . This system several theoretical advantage . The delivery high flow decrease dilution inhale oxygen , match patient 's peak flow , allow accurate delivery set FiO2 throughout whole inspiratory phase . In addition , flow-dependent effect continuous positive airway pressure , possibly due air entrainment mechanism , document healthy volunteer patient COPD . Lastly , use high humidity level may prevent damage ciliated epithelium airway , maintain mucociliary system activity , facilitate elimination secretion . Through effect , new device high-flow oxygen therapy potential effective improve tolerance treatment conventional system oxygen therapy , Venturi mask . In present randomize , control trial , investigator compare two device oxygen therapy , nasal high-flow oxygen therapy standard Venturi mask , critically ill patient need oxygen post-extubation period . The hypothesis nasal high-flow superior Venturi mask term oxygenation</detailed_description>
