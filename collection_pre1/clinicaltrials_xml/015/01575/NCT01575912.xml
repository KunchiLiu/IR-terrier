	<brief_summary>Differences pain perception subject without psychiatric illness may influence individual experience , primarily pathology , although pathological frame may amplify it.The aim study establish characteristic experimental pain feeling influence past pain experience , anxiety emotion , independently diagnosis . The pain experience evaluate inventory potentially painful situation one come across life , determine follow point : Number painful event past , number painful point last 6 month , number painful event last 6 month , sum pain intensity ( graduate Visual Analogic Scale VAS 0 10 ) , sum gravity ( evaluate 0 5 ) , category pain experience qualification ( mostly affective , mostly sensorial , ) . Schizophrenic , depress control participant recruit , pain experience throughout life put relation experimental pain test result ( pressure application , ischemia induction ) , anxiety emotion ( Hospital Anxiety Depression scale HAD ) , catastrophizing ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale PCS ) , Heart Rate ( HR ) variation , Blood Pressure ( BP ) variation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The perception moderate experimental pain ( 3 ten visual analogue scale VAS ) subject schizophrenia ( Girard et coll. , 2011 ) , major depression ( ED ) ( bipolar isolated/recurrent episode ) ( publish ) comparison control without psychiatric pathology show exploration pain situation like medical examination identify painful point do condition person psychiatric trouble person without mental disease . But risk expression pain , either experimental condition daily life , relation feel perception pain . Numerous factor may interfere pain message modulation , like past pain experience , stress anxiety , partially explore experimental study . The individual experience pain construct throughout whole life , several influence ( biological , psychological , sociocultural ) . The symptoms interface different psychiatric trouble seem widely involve pain process , progressive construction . This study aim well understand relationship variable . Procedures apply : Anterior pain experience evaluation ( questionnaire ) ; Pain test : 160 kPa pressure application determine correspond pain VAS ) , ischemia induction determine time necessary obtain pain equivalent 3 10 ; anxiety emotional evaluation ( Hospital Anxiety Depression scale ) , catastrophizing evaluation ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale ) , HR variation BP variation ( vegetative measure link anxiety ) collection diagnosis , therapeutic treatment</detailed_description>
