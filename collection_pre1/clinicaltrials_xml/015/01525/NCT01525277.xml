	<brief_title>The Side Implantable Central Vascular Catheters Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantable central venous catheter ( CVC ) crucial cancer patient . They provide central venous access chemotherapy high-concentration nutrition support . However , several potential CVC-related complication may develop severely interfere patient ' cancer treatment life-threatening occasion . Thrombotic event occur around 20 % cancer patient implantable CVCs . Such event include intraluminal thrombosis catheter-related venous thrombosis . Catheter removal usually necessary resolve condition . Treatment delay inevitable patient . Besides , thrombotic complication associate catheter-related infection , could highly dangerous cancer patient . Risk factor associate thrombotic event include hypercoagulable state patient , cancer type , catheter type , placement catheter tip superior vena cava . Some single-arm study find CVC insert leave subclavian vein lead CVC-related thrombosis insert right subclavian vein . However , right-handed patient , place implantable CVCs right side inconvenient daily life vigorous exercise impossible . Besides , single-arm study could well control potentially interfering factor , operator , catheter location cancer type . Therefore , plan randomize observational study explore whether side implantable CVCs actually associate complication rate . Cancer patient need implantable CVCs randomize catheter implant either leave subclavian vein right subclavian . Patients breast cancer , mediastinal mass diameter &gt; 6 cm , ECOG performance score &gt; 2 , able receive stand P-A view chest X-ray exclude . Patients reason prevent randomization also exclude . The catheter-related complication actively report patient . We also enforce record complication chart review regular telephone contact . With study , demonstrate whether left-sided CVC right-sided CVC different complication rate . The result useful clinical practice .</detailed_description>
