	<detailed_description>The incidence Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus increase annually , pediatric age group , especially among infant toddler . However , 30 % diabetic child manage achieve maintain glycated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level 8 % , although treat intensive insulin therapy multiple daily injection ( MDI ) subcutaneous continuous insulin infusion ( SCII ) . The presence high HbA1c level increase probability long term complication diabetes , retinopathy , nephropathy neuropathy . This failure attribute multiple reason ; irregular meal , unpredictable physical activity , behavioral difficulty , refusal accept diabetes maintain required lifestyle , resistance insulin , , fear hypoglycemia hypoglycemia unawareness . Further , recurrent hypoglycemic episode age 6 year old may cause neurocognitive permanent damage . Recently , device real-time continuous glucose monitoring ( RT-CGMS ) introduce aid self management glycemic control . These device enable patient see interstitial glucose level continuously , trend decrement increment , alarm prior severe hypoglycemic episode . Only study perform pediatric population . One show decrement 0.27 % HbA1c 1 month 1 % decrement 50 % study population 3 month , adult population . A study perform minority group well control diabetic patient ( HA1c &lt; 7.5 % ) demonstrate increment 1.56 hour per day normoglycemia , less time spend hypoglycemia among use RT-CGMS 26 week . However , study perform choose group motivate patient , state research multiple clinic visit reminder . Those study always reflect real life benefit equipment best usage method . The RT-CGMS approve Israel routine usage pediatric population , 0-18 year 2011 , indicate recurrent hypoglycemic episode . The aim study - examine prospectively short long term effect RT-CGMS routine usage , daily routine life diabetic toddler , child adolescent glycemic control , frequency day time nocturnal hypoglycemia quality life research template . - identify characteristic patient benefit RT-CGMS routine usage . - identify characteristic patient benefit , even worsen RT-CGMS routine usage Study design : This prospective multicenter case-control cohort study . We follow prospectively patient receive RT-CGMS part routine management , period 2 year , five center pediatric diabetes care Israel . All participant receive similar guidance instruction prior RT-CGMS usage . All clinic visit , interval 3 month record , include data regard weight , height , insertion site , blood glucose average measurement , CGMS measurements variability , frequency hypoglycemia , time spend normoglycemia HbA1c . Quality Life Anxiety questionnaires fill bi-annually .</detailed_description>
