	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study safety effectiveness continuous hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) floxuridine ( FUDR ) alone combination chemotherapeutic drug treat patient locally advance cholangiocarcinoma remove surgery . HAI method deliver high concentration FUDR directly liver tumor reduces side effect . HAI alone combination oxaliplatin and/or gemcitabine may significantly improve clinical outcome patient locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
