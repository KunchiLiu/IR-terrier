	<brief_summary>This prospective study compare quality life measure patient refractory overactive bladder , two mode neuromodulation : vaginal electrical stimulation ( Group A ) sacral nerve stimulation ( Group B ) . The specific aim : 1 . To characterize patient symptom bother score , quality life , body image score patient obtain sacral nerve stimulation , compare vaginal electrical stimulation . - Hypothesis 1 : Both mode neuromodulation impact patient ' score quality life , patient symptom , body image questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaginal Electrical Stimulation Versus Neuromodulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant standardize intake history include age , weight , history prior treatment incontinence , medication list , obstetric gynecologic history , medical history , surgical history , well complete review system . The physical examination include vital sign ( include BMI ) , genitourinary exam , include Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification ( POPQ ) , neurologic exam . All patient undergo spontaneous uroflowmetry , urine dipstick catheterize specimen , multichannel urodynamics , 3-day voiding diary . Measurement post-void residual also obtain . Completion UDI-69 , King 's Health Questionnaire10 , Modified Body Image Perception Scale ( MBIS ) also part initial visit 11,12 . All participant take anticholinergic undergo 2 week flush-out period prior intake assessment . After intake assessment , provider determine treatment option appropriate participant , assign one two treatment arm : Group A use vaginal electrical stimulation use Empi Intravaginal Stimulation Unit Minnova ( Empi , St. Paul , MN , USA ) participant Group B receive sacral neuromodulation use InterStim ( Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) .</detailed_description>
