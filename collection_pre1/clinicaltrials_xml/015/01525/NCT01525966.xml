	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give carboplatin paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together surgery work treat patient locally advanced inflammatory triple negative breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Before Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Inflammatory Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) therapy demonstrate promising neoadjuvant pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate eligible patient . II . To test hypothesis carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel therapy demonstrate promising Symmans 0-1 pathological response rate eligible patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I To evaluate overall survival event-free survival eligible patient treat carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy . II . To evaluate toxicity tolerance carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel therapy patient population . III . To evaluate role laboratory correlate response , toxicity survival endpoint . IV . To procure tissue perform analysis gene protein expression profile pre-treatment primary tumor ( estimate success rate : 80 % ) residual tumor ( 25 % ) lymph node include study tumor niche ( 50 % ) , study sequential assessment cellular characteristic gene protein expression profile . V. To identify specific mutation tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) comparison adjacent tissue germ line DNA procure prior , , subsequent neoadjuvant chemotherapy , detect/measure , feasible , presence mutation fragment circulate DNA plasma , correlate mutation presence/characteristics circulate tumor cell order identify prognostic predictive indicator persisting/relapsed disease target therapy . VI . To assess ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( use Mammaprint/Blueprint 44,000 Agilent platform gene array ) , ( micro ) miRNA protein profile tumor , adjacent tissue plasma prior , , completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy order establish prognostic predictive indicator outcome , marker persistent/relapsed disease , target therapy . VII . To analyze tumor DNA genomic DNA plasma microarray reverse transcriptase ( RT ) -polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis ass copy numbers/single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) /genomic polymorphisms gene purpose establish prognostic predictive indicator outcomes ; marker persistence/relapse disease , drug resistance , drug metabolism ; target therapy . VIII . To assess prognostic predictive value conventional pathological feature ( stage , estrogen progesterone receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor [ HER-2 ] status , presence lymphovascular invasion , high grade tumor status ) comparison value derive molecular approach . IX . To procure tumor primary definitive surgical specimen purpose establish breast cancer stem cell line . X . To procure blood sample purpose identify characterize circulate tumor cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 4 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
