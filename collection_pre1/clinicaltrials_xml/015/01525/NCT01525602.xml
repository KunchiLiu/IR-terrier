	<criteria>Patients : Part 1 ( enrollment close ) : advanced , incurable solid tumor Part 2 ( enrollment close ) : advanced , incurable solid tumor taxane would consider reasonable chemotherapy option Part 3 ( enrollment close ) : advanced , metastatic nonresectable epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer platinumresistant cancer , define disease respond platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen , demonstrate recurrence within six month follow completion platinumcontaining regimen , OR platinumrefractory cancer , define disease fail achieve least partial response platinumcontaining regimen ( i.e. , stable disease actual disease progression ) , AND treat taxane within six month C1D1 , AND treat weekly paclitaxel firstline treatment weekly paclitaxel plus platinum permit Part 3 : Patients must target ( ≥2 cm diameter ) nontarget lesion cancer accessible core biopsy start study one cycle treatment . Patients stable brain metastasis eligible trial . However , patient must require steroid treatment brain metastasis within 30 day Screening . Bonedirected therapy ( e.g. , bisphosphonates denosumab ) permit . Washout prior investigational therapy least five time T1/2 prior C1D1 Washout prior biologic targeted therapy least 4 week five time T1/2 ( whichever short ) prior C1D1 Washout prior chemotherapy least 2 week 1 elimination halflife , whichever longer , prior C1D1 Washout prior hormonal therapy least 2 week prior C1D1 Washout least 2 week recent radiation treatment prior C1D1 Resolution prior treatmentrelated toxicity Grade 1 less , except Grade 2 fatigue alopecia prior C1D1 Age eighteen year older ECOG performance status 02 , inclusive Anticipated life expectancy least 12 week Adequate bone marrow reserve : ANC ≥1500/mm3 , platelet ≥100,000/mm3 Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN calculate CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min use CockcroftGault formula Adequate hepatic function : AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN , Total Direct Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN . However , presence liver metastasis , AST ALT must &lt; 5 x ULN Cardiac ejection fraction ≥50 % , QTcF &lt; 450 m ( male ) &lt; 470 m ( female ) ECG Baseline . Able swallow capsule maintain adequate hydration Ability give write informed consent willing comply requirement protocol ; Part 3 , give write informed consent 2 cancer biopsy procedure Women childbearing potential must agree use effective method birth control treatment three month receive last dose study drug . Fertile men must also agree use acceptable method birth control study drug least 3 month last dose . Presence active secondary malignancy . Patients nonmelanomatous , situ malignancy disease completely resectable surgery may consider discussion Medical Monitor Patients completely treat prior malignancy evidence disease ≥3 year eligible Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , external biliary shunt significant small bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption PLX3397 Ongoing treatment investigational therapy Prior anaphylactic severe hypersensitivity reaction paclitaxel Cremophorcontaining agent . Persistent grade 2 fatigue Baseline . Severe , concurrent illness include congestive heart failure , significant cardiac disease uncontrolled hypertension , would likely prevent patient able comply study protocol Active untreated infection Known chronic active Hepatitis B C , HIV infection The presence medical psychiatric condition , opinion Principal Investigator , make patient inappropriate inclusion study .</criteria>
