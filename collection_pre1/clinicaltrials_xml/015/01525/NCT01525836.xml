	<brief_title>rhTPO Combining Rituximab Versus Low-dose Rituximab Management ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 240 refractory ITP adult patient 14 medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive recombinant human thrombopoietin ( give subcutaneously dose 300 Units/kg 14 consecutive day , follow flexible dosage depend platelet count 29th day ) , combine rituximab ( give intravenously dose 100 mg weekly 4 week , i.e . Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; others select receive low-dose rituximab treatment ( give intravenously dose 100 mg weekly , i.e . Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study . In order report efficacy safety combination therapy compare conventional rituximab therapy treatment adult refractory ITP .</detailed_description>
