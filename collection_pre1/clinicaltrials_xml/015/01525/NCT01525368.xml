	<brief_summary>Cognitive training show successful patient amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) , group high-risk Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Moreover , randomize control trial , investigator recently find aMCI patient receive cognitive intervention show stable hypometabolism FDG-PET , whereas patient active control group show pronounced hypometabolism follow-up scan region typically affect AD . Previous study indicate patient respond equally well cognitive intervention . Identifying factor predict response treatment could help select patient target intervention . A potentially important predictor cognitive reserve define premorbid cognitive performance . The hypothesis different level cognitive reserve ( high cognitive reserve vs. low cognitive reserve ) different neurostructural neurofunctional correlate influence treatment response different way . Moreover , impact white matter lesion treatment effect investigate . The investigator perform complex cognitive training program . Forty patient aMCI ( 20 high cognitive reserve , 20 low cognitive reserve ) recruit study . Since patient recruit consecutively , estimate overall number 80 include receive training 40 meet inclusion criterion cognitive-reserve-study ( high low cognitive reserve ) . Data whole group use analyze potential impact white matter lesion response intervention . Cognitive effect intervention evaluate neuropsychological testing . Neurofunctional neurostructural change depend cognitive reserve measure use rest state fMRI diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . For comparison , group 30 aMCI patient recruit active control group receive study investigation ( neuropsychological test well MRIs ) , exercise self-study home , complex cognitive intervention .</brief_summary>
