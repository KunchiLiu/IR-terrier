	<brief_summary>This study look use three cycle chemotherapy give prior radiation therapy patient cancer oral cavity evidence prior exposure Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) . Patients cancer oral cavity evidence exposure HPV good prognosis evidence exposure HPV . The main hypothesis study use three cycle chemotherapy prior embark radiation therapy allow use reduce dos radiation therapy , therefore , less radiation induce side-effects . The primary objective determine activity pre-radiation chemotherapy strategy along reduce dose level radiation without chemotherapy radiation phase . The effectiveness strategy assess three month follow completion radiation therapy phase also two year follow completion radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Induction Chemotherapy TPF induction chemotherapy administer publish TAX 323 phase III trial . Specifically , cycle consist docetaxel dose 75 mg per square meter , administer 1-hour infusion day 1 , follow cisplatin dose 75 mg per square meter , administer 1-hour infusion day 1 , fluorouracil dose 750 mg per square meter per day , administer continuous infusion day 1 5 . Induction chemotherapy give every 3 week three cycle , unless distant disease progression , unacceptable toxic effect , withdrawal consent patient . All patient require continuous venous access device PICC line Infusaport type device . This standard care continuous infusion fluorouracil . Response assessment examination , contrast-enhanced CT image whole body PET-CT perform third treatment cycle . Radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy commence within 3-4 week conclusion induction program . Selection Radiation Alone vs. Chemoradiotherapy For CR/PR patient CR primary site follow induction chemotherapy , locoregional therapy risk-adjusted accord baseline tumor stage/characteristics . Local therapy 1 ) radiotherapy single modality Tx ( T1-2 ) , T0-1 exophytic T2 , N0-2a disease , 2 ) concomitant chemoradiotherapy Tx ( T3 ) , endophytic T2 , T3 , N2b-c disease . Patients PR primary site receive concurrent chemotherapy reduce dose radiation . All SD/PD patient receive concurrent chemotherapy full dose radiation . Patients catalogued disease progression basis new distant metastatic disease spread ( DM ) induction chemotherapy take protocol consideration palliative therapy . Concurrent Chemotherapy Concurrent chemotherapy consist cisplatin give 35 mg/m2 weekly six cycle OR carboplatin give AUC 1.5 weekly six cycle . Concurrent chemotherapy start first week radiation treatment . Selection either schedule leave discretion attend medical oncologist . Concurrent chemotherapy hold platelet count &lt; 100,000 absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000 per cubic mm . IMRT dose Primary Target ( residual gross disease ) : 66 Gy call CTV1 ( 2.2 Gy/fraction 30 fraction ) . Intermediate-Risk Target : 57 Gy call CTV2 ( 1.9 Gy/fraction 30 fraction ) . Prophylactic Target Coverage : 54 Gy call CTV3 ( 1.8 Gy/fraction 30 fraction ) . IMRT plan Treatment plan CT scan require define target volume . The treatment planning CT scan acquire patient position immobilization device treatment . All tissue irradiate must include CT scan . MRI whole body PET/CT scan may include assist definition target volume , especially primary retropharyngeal nodal disease extend near base skull . The immobilization device include neck shoulder immobilization . GTV , CTVs , PTVs , normal tissue must outline CT slice structure exist . Primary Target CTV1 : All region GTV-R PR patient receive 66 Gy 30 fraction , attempt cover remainder initial GTV . There CTV1 CR patient . Intermediate-Risk Target CTV2 : This volume encompass initial primary nodal GTV volume , region adjacent GTV ( e.g . contralateral base tongue ) , well complete anatomic coverage involve cervical neck level . This receive 57 Gy 30 fraction . Prophylactic Target Coverage CTV3 : This volume cover uninvolved at-risk nodal basin . This receive 54 Gy 30 fraction . Low Neck Conventional Field Treatment : Bilateral low neck/supraclavicular fossa initially treat beam-split AP field 40 Gy 20 fraction 3x3 cm larynx block match central axis inferior edge IMRT treatment field . Treatment continue 50 Gy midline cord block 5 daily fraction . Cone-down AP mid neck boost 56 Gy administer low neck CTV2 , superior edge clavicle . Treatment continue 64 Gy low neck CTV1 volume , respect brachial plexus dose limitation . Dose specification The prescription dose isodose encompasses least 95 % PTV . No 20 % PTV receive &gt; 110 % prescribe dose . No 1 % PTV receive &lt; 93 % prescribe dose . No 1 % 1 cc tissue outside PTVs receive &gt; 110 % dose prescribed primary PTV . Fractionation treatment duration Treatment deliver daily , 5 fraction per week , 6 week . All target treat simultaneously . Breaks treatment minimize . Break treatment time 5 day consider major variation require documentation underlie specific reason treatment break ( ex . relate study drug and/or chemotherapy and/or RT ) . Functional Quality-of-Life Assessments Clinical Assessment Treatment-Related Symptoms , Dietary Status : MDASI-HN MDADI instrument self-administered study subject baseline , treatment completion , routine post-radiation surveillance appointment subsequent 24 month . At time point , nutritional status also assess weight , normalcy diet score base result PSS-HN , feed tube dependence amount nutritional intake ( yes/no ) . The radiation oncology research nurse oversee subject completion instrument . MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory ( MDADI ) : The MDADI measure swallowing-related quality life ( QOL ) patient swallow dysfunction . It evaluate patient 's physical , emotional , functional perception swallow dysfunction , validate head neck cancer patient . Performance Status Scale Head Neck Cancer Patients ( PSS-H &amp; N ) : The PSS-H &amp; N clinician rat instrument consist three subscales : 1 ) normalcy diet , 2 ) public eating , 3 ) understandability speech . The radiation oncology research nurse speech-language pathologist complete PSS-H &amp; N . Modified Barium Swallow ( MBS ) Study : Patients undergo MBS test baseline , 4-6 , 12 , 24 month completion ART . Studies perform use standard radiographic system videofluoroscope focused patient 's lip anteriorly , posterior pharyngeal wall posteriorly , hard palate superiorly , upper esophageal segment inferiorly . The order bolus presentation include : two 5-ml Varibar thin liquid bolus , two 10-ml Varibar thin liquid bolus , two 20-ml Varibar thin liquid bolus , two cup sip Varibar thin liquid , two pureed/Varibar pudding bolus , two solid bolus consist Â¼ shortbread cookie cracker coat Varibar pudding , 2 trial difficult consistency A-P plane . The following measure use quantify MBS finding : ( 1 ) Penetration-Aspiration Scale ( PAS ) - The PAS clinician rat 8-point , ordinal scale use describe penetration aspiration event . Scores determine depth bolus invasion airway patient 's response ; high score assume severe sign dysphagia . Intra- interjudge reliability establish head neck cancer patient . ( 2 ) Oropharyngeal swallow efficiency - ( OPSE ) global measure swallow function define ratio percent swallow esophagus divide oropharyngeal transit time . Thus , high OPSE score indicate safer efficient oropharyngeal swallow . The continuous score obtain find correlate degree oropharyngeal dysphagia head neck cancer patient . ( 3 ) National Institutes Health Swallowing Safety Scale ( NIH-SSS ) - The NIH-SSS provide continuous numeric score quantify swallow safety use 7 dysphagia symptom , residue , penetration , aspiration , response aspiration , esophageal entry , regurgitation , multiple swallow . The scale demonstrate high reliability ( intra- interrater intraclass correlation coefficient &gt; .95 ) validity dysphagic patient . We concurrently evaluate utility patient head neck cancer . The speech pathologist complete PAS , OPSE , NIH-SSS analysis MBS study . Salivary Flow Quantification : For unstimulated resting sialometry , patient instruct first clear mouth swallow . With head hold slightly forward , patient instruct swallow 5-minute collection , allow saliva collect floor mouth . The patient expectorate accumulate saliva pre-weighed 100 mL vial 60 second . The patient repeat procedure 4 time total collection time 5 minute . At end 5 minute , collection vial promptly seal weigh . For collection , actual clock time start end collection record well vial weight collection sample . Stimulated sialometry perform . Patients rest 5 minute prior collection . The exogenous stimulant 20 mL citric acid solution hold mouth 1 minute . After patient expectorates solution , 5-minute saliva collection take place describe . These measurement do radiation oncology research nurse .</detailed_description>
