	<brief_summary>The objective study prospectively evaluate effect early versus delay removal transuretheral catheter follow sacrocolpopexy . The investigator specific aim determine optimal time removal indwell transurethral catheter postoperatively effort reduce risk postoperative urinary retention urinary tract infection associate catheter use . The investigator hypotheses follow : Hypothesis 1 : Longer duration postoperative catheter use result decrease postoperative urinary retention . Hypothesis 2 : Shorter duration postoperative catheter use result lower incidence urinary tract infection .</brief_summary>
