	<brief_title>Single Arm Study RAD001 Monotherapy Treatment Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma one common cause cancer death Thailand . Patients cholangiocarcinoma often diagnose advanced stage . Palliative therapeutic approach consist percutaneous endoscopic biliary drainage usually use patient , since effective chemotherapeutic treatment type cancer . Activation phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt/mTOR signal pathway frequently find cholangiocarcinoma cell . It suggest key step lead progression cholangiocarcinoma . In study , investigator hypothesize inhibition mTOR may useful treat cholangiocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
