	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness magnesium oxide supplement reversal calcium deposit skin , yellow bump fold skin subject pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) . Magnesium oxide dietary supplement show research reduce calcium deposit . This study consist two part . The first part year-long , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Part two open-label , year-long study . In Part 1 , qualify subject randomize receive either magnesium oxide supplement placebo , 1:1 ratio first 12 month . The start dose 1000 mg daily , depend tolerability , dos may decrease . Baseline evaluation comprise : blood test ; clinical evaluation ; skin biopsy ; eye examination ; bone density test ; photography skin lesion . Subjects evaluate week 2 , week 6 , month 3 , every 3 month first year . Upon completion first year , bar safety concern , subject administer magnesium oxide supplement one additional year . Subjects undergo evaluations/ procedure every 3 month . We hypothesize magnesium oxide cause reduction calcification subject 's soft tissue/skin . Funding Source - FDA OOPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) systemic connective tissue disorder involve elastic fiber calcification fragmentation major clinical manifestation occur cutaneous , ocular cardiovascular system . Calcification elastic fiber lead crack Bruch 's membrane , elastic tissue-containing membrane separate vascular choroid retinal pigment epithelium . These know angioid streak may sign disease year . Retinal hemorrhage loss vision common . Calcification internal elastic lamina artery result gastrointestinal bleeding , sometimes fatal nature . Accelerated heart disease additional complication . Cutaneous manifestation characterize presence yellow papule cobblestone pattern plaque resemble `` pluck chicken-skin '' flexural region . Redundant fold skin may develop advanced case . The frequent site cutaneous involvement include neck , axilla , inguinal region , antecubital popliteal fossae periumbilical area . Skin lesion provide easy way grade degree calcification elastic tissue . A clinical study 80 subject variety cutaneous soft tissue mineralization disorder affect area inject locally magnesium sulfate also receive oral magnesium lactate 4 6 month . About 75 % subject show significant decrease complete disappearance calcification . More recently , knockout mouse model PXE link reversal calcification diet high magnesium . Mice place diet either high low phosphate , high low magnesium , control diet . The mouse place high magnesium diet show evidence connective tissue mineralization , diet show mineralization characterize calcification connective tissue capsule surround vibrissa . Based information research link increase magnesium level decrease calcification , plan supplement diet PXE patient magnesium oxide order show reduction elastic fiber calcification skin slow progression disease . Randomized subject instruct take study drug ( active placebo ) 12 month , subject receive active study drug follow 12 month . When ingested food , magnesium demonstrate adverse effect . When obtained supplement , however , excessive magnesium intake know result diarrhea well gastrointestinal effect nausea , abdominal cramping . Large pharmacological dos magnesium associate serious side effect , metabolic alkalosis hypokalemia repeat daily ingestion 30g magnesium oxide . Hypermagnesemia may result excessive magnesium supplement ingestion , however , rarely reported individual normal renal function . Study data analyze use Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test compare change physician global assessment skin lesion , evaluation target lesion assessment biopsy treatment placebo group . Assuming negligible placebo response , believe power analysis perform primary measure 40 complete subject propose study . Analyses base intent-to-treat , last observation carry forward . Patients withdraw safety , lack efficacy , generally without documentation absence request 'final-visit evaluation ' assign high ( bad ) score . A find significance base intent-to-treat analysis would supplement analysis patient complete trial without protocol deviation .</detailed_description>
