	<brief_summary>The observed change P. falciparum sensitivity artemisinin lead intensification early detection well treatment monitor malaria infection . It widely accept development resistance delay use combination therapy , especially artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) . The resistance problem consider extremely serious consequence WHO recommend monotherapy malaria stop Current WHO guideline recommend drug combination regimens use ACT effective partner medicine decrease risk development spread artemisinin resistance . Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) ; fixed-dose combination Dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) Piperaquine phosphate ( PQP ) one recommend drug WHO oral treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum . DHA-PQP composes blood schizonticidal drug , different mechanism action different half-life improve therapeutic efficacy prevent development drug resistance individual drug . Moreover , beneficial mutual protection resistance long last protection new infection , due long half-life PQP . Primaquine effective gametocytocidal P. falciparum transmission prevention tissue kill radical cure Plasmodium vivax Plasmodium ovale infection . It give presence antimalarial , necessary data potential drug interaction primaquine DHA-PQP characterized . It inevitable near future , Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) primaquine combination treatment become necessary . These drug metabolize cytochrome P450 enzyme potentially cause pharmacokinetic alteration , result clinically significant drug-drug interaction cause unanticipated adverse reaction therapeutic failure suboptimal exposure parasite . This study plan evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interaction orally administer primaquine ( PQ ) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) healthy adult subject . The result interaction study important order provide clinical guidance optimum combination primaquine DHA-PQP treatment regimens malaria infection .</brief_summary>
