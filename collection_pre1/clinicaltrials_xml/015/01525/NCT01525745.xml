	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effective SBRT compare traditional radiation treat cancer spread spine cause pain . SBRT deliver high dose short period time compare standard radiation therapy aim see improvement pain control cancer It know whether SBRT well bad current standard therapy . If select receive experimental treatment research study , SBRT use highly focused x-ray deliver single high dose specific area spine compare conventional standard radiation period 10 day standard proven treatment help condition . The investigator also determine treatment provide rapid pain relief least side effect . It possible SBRT may better could toxic . The investigator conduct quality life assessment pain scale index ass feel intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy v . Conventional Radiation Spine Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither research doctor choose group . You 2 1 chance place SBRT standard radiation group . Since SBRT newer treatment test , would like include patient group . Treatment Procedures : SBRT : You may receive one , three five SBRT treatment depend extent cancer . During treatment assessed nurse physician physical neurological assessment . The treatment would last approximately I hour lie treatment table . Prior treatment physical neurological assessment physician . Standard Radiation : You receive ten consecutive work day standard radiation . While treatment last five ten minute , entire visit may last thirty minute . During treatment lie treatment table . Once per week physical neurological assessment treat physician After final treatment study therapy : We would like keep track medical condition least 12 month receive treatment . We would like come clinic month 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month treatment* . At visit look information screening time frame . This include : - A history physical - A Performance Status able carry usual activity . - A Pain scale questionnaire call Numerical Rating Pain Scale ( NRPS ) ask explain pain symptom 0-10 scale - 3 Quality Of Life ( QOL ) Assessments describe : - Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) - The Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) - The EuroQOL ( EQ-5D ) - An assessment tumor MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging )</detailed_description>
