	<detailed_description>Neonatal mortality important global public health challenge . Approximately 4 million neonatal death per year occur develop country , account 40 % deaths child 5 . Infection , birth asphyxia consequence premature birth/low birth weight responsible majority death . Although advance neonatal intensive care lead improved survival premature infant , sepsis continue important cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Lactoferrin , iron-binding protein multiple physiological function ( anti-microbial , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory ) , one important proteins present mammalian milk . Our hypothesis lactoferrin give daily oral food supplement preterm infant improve health mimic protective role milk . There vast literature show vitro animal model benefit lactoferrin . However , clinical study design translate knowledge patient care . A recent Italian study show lactoferrin give low-birth weight infant reduce incidence sepsis ( 17 % vs. 6 % ) death . Whether lactoferrin effect high risk population impact subsequent neurodevelopment growth remain determined . Specific aim 1 : The investigator test hypothesis bovine lactoferrin supplementation prevents serious infection preterm infant . The investigator conduct randomize placebo-controlled double blind study 414 premature infant &lt; 2000 g Neonatal Units Lima , Peru determine whether bovine lactoferrin prevents late-onset sepsis sepsis-associated death . This hypothesis base lactoferrin´s antimicrobial immunomodulating activity . Lactoferrin protect pathogens multiple way : sequesters iron essential bacterial growth ; bind lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) cell surface Gram negative bacteria , disrupt bacterial cell membrane ; anti-lipoteichoic acid ( Gram positive organism ) anti-Candida cell wall activity . The investigator find lactoferrin inhibits growth ; impairs virulence major pathogen decrease ability adhere invade mammalian cell , binding , degrading , specific virulence protein . Lactoferrin may protect infant sepsis block attachment invasion organism gut . Specific aim 2 : The investigator test hypothesis bovine lactoferrin supplementation promotes well neurodevelopment growth outcome preterm infant assess Mullen Scales Early Learning , standardize neurologic exam growth measurement 12 , 18 24 month correct age . It postulate exposure preterm brain inflammatory mediator infectious episode contribute brain ( white matter ) injury poor developmental outcome . It demonstrate breast milk beneficial effect neurodevelopment outcomes preterm infant . The investigator hypothesize lactoferrin major factor milk responsible effect due antimicrobial immunomodulatory property : reduces inflammation decrease production tumor necrosis factor α pro-inflammatory molecule , regulate immune response , protect severe inflammation relate infection septic shock . In addition , investigator hypothesize lactoferrin improve growth decrease frequency growth-impairing infection lactoferrin effect intestinal cell proliferation , differentiation maturation . The use lactoferrin broad-spectrum non-pathogen specific antimicrobial protective protein innovative approach . If successful study profoundly affect clinical care neonate develop develop world .</detailed_description>
