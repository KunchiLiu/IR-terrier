	<brief_title>Feasibility Lateral Flow Urine Lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) Test Diagnosis Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) incidence mortality increase dramatically result HIV epidemic . In part sub-Saharan Africa , TB lead cause death among HIV-infected patient approximately 50 % TB patient HIV co-infected . Early treatment TB hinder lack rapid , accurate diagnostic modality apply resource-constrained setting . Mycobacterial culture laboratory standard diagnosis active TB , costly , require access specialized laboratory , take week provide result . Sputum smear microscopy detects less half HIV-infected TB case many setting . The Global Plan Stop TB prioritize development simple , accurate , inexpensive test TB case detection HIV-positive individual . LAM : As strategy rapid TB diagnosis , detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen explore several decade . Lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) , glycolipid component outer cell wall mycobacteria , attractive diagnostic target several reason : heat-stable ; clear kidney ; detectable urine ; bacterial product , theoretical potential discriminate active TB latent TB infection independent human immune response . A urine test could facilitate TB diagnosis patient sputum uninformative obtainable , lack infection-control risk associate sputum production blood collection . Urine LAM detection may amenable simple , rapid , inexpensive point-of-care platform . This prospective study evaluate accuracy , diagnostic yield , operational performance , time diagnosis novel lateral-flow urine LAM test detect tuberculosis HIV-infected adult . HIV-positive adult suspect TB enrol provide informed consent . Urine obtain test use novel lateral flow urine LAM assay exist ELISA-based urine LAM assay . Conventional microbiological test TB chest x-ray also perform . These test perform participant enrol ( target sample size = 500 ) . A secondary study objective determine accuracy , efficiency , cost , cost-effectiveness various combination TB diagnostic test , include novel Xpert MTB/Rif test . The Xpert MTB/Rif test perform subset participant ( approximately 200 participant total 500 participant expect enroll LAM component study . )</detailed_description>
