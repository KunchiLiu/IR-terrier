This mean incomplete colonoscopy , malignant pre-malignant lesion may miss investigation pursue . Several explanatory factor incomplete colonoscopy describe . Patient factor show increase risk incomplete examination include advanced age , female sex , previous abdominal/pelvic surgery , diverticular disease . After incomplete conventional colonoscopy , patient require undergo another test complete visualization colon . Options incomplete examination anatomic reason include radiologic endoscopic mean . CT Colonography ( CTC ) permit visualise whole colon , minimally invasive , require sedation well accept patient . The present role CTC integration replacement barium enema case incomplete colonoscopy . In fact , since 2006 American Gastroenterological Association ( AGA ) Clinical Practice Economics Committee endorse CTC method choice colon investigation case incomplete colonoscopy numerous evidence exists literature show clear superiority CTC Barium Enema detection CRC polyp . Two large , multicenter trial [ American College Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN ) trial perform USA Italian Multicenter Polyps Accuracy CTC study ( IMPACT ) trial test performance CTC comparison conventional colonoscopy report negative predictive value trial CTC approach 100 % ; extremely important order reassure negative patient significance examination.The PillCam Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( Given® Diagnostic System ) offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon patient incomplete conventional colonoscopy . Advantages PillCam Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( PCCE ) include elimination need sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , need X-rays ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , PCCE may well accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo second diagnostic evaluation colon failure first endoscopic examination comply colorectal cancer screen recommendation . This study design evaluate performance PCCE evaluation patient incomplete colonoscopy , compare CT-colonography . PCCE CT-colonography procedure compare regard completeness procedure detection lesion colon would miss incomplete conventional colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
