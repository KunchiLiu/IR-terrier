	<brief_title>EUS Prior ERCP Positive Setting Positive Intraoperative Cholangiogram ( IOC ) During Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During routine cholecystectomy , surgeon often perform intraoperative cholangiogram effort define anatomical landmark ensure patency drainage common bile duct . This involve inject radiopaque contrast medium biliary tree operation . Occasionally contrast injection onto common bile duct reveal abnormality deem `` positive intraoperative cholangiogram '' ( positive IOC ) . These abnormality include follow : single multiple stone ; non-filling duodenum contrast ; stenosis narrow common bile duct ( CBD ) . When discovered finding well address treat endoscopically via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . ERCP 's consider gold standard diagnosis treatment positive intraoperative cholangiograms . However , several study show 40-50 % patient undergo ERCP `` positive '' IOC normal cholangiogram . Reasons include spontaneous stone passage stone , dysmotility biliary tree , poor quality , incomplete , misinterpretation IOC . Therefore ERCP 's performed could avoid . ERCP performance carry significant complication include pancreatitis ( 5-10 % ) , bleed , perforation . Ideally safer test ass bile duct could perform immediately prior ERCP confirm presence positive IOC finding , would ensure ERCP perform therapeutic mean thus avoid unnecessary ERCP 's . EUS often perform prior ERCP 's sedation endoscopy unit . From 2005 2007 , two hundred twenty seven `` combine EUS ERCP procedure perform . ( unpublished internal data ) . Our experience `` combine '' EUS ERCP procedure demonstrate perform EUS prior ERCP prolong total procedure time le 10 minute significant increase adverse event . Performance EUS prior ERCP confirm biliary pathology `` positive '' IOC never study rigorous fashion .</detailed_description>
