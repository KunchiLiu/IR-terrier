	<brief_summary>Numerous epidemiological study clearly show relationship excessive growth visceral adipose tissue risk develop insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk factor . However , mechanism contribute deleterious role visceral adipose tissue remain elucidate . Several observation suggest adipose tissue depot exhibit distinct metabolic secretory capacity accord location . We recently show visceral fat depot display high immuno-inflammatory cell infiltration subcutaneous fat . In addition , endothelial cell visceral compare subcutaneous adipose tissue express pro-inflammatory phenotype several marker related age . Finally , show visceral adipocyte-derived secretion promote endothelial cell senescence extent high subcutaneous adipocyte-derived product . These data suggest senescence 1 ) might phenomenon related location therefore microenvironment adipose tissue 2 ) might responsible abnormal activation proinflammatory response , favour development metabolic secretory dysfunction adipose tissue obesity . Our work hypothesis , base observation , visceral adipose tissue provide microenvironment promotes accelerate age . This senescence may responsible establishment inflammatory reaction , alteration metabolic activity adipocyte differentiation capacity progenitor cell lead development obesity associate disease . The propose project descriptive cross-sectional pathophysiological study .The aim 1 ) good define process senescence human adipose tissue , 2 ) precise mechanism 3 ) analyse cellular functional consequence age inflammation , adipose tissue development metabolism . 200 morbidly obese candidate bariatric surgery study . The collection clinical laboratory data collection biological sample ( plasma , blood cell subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue ) make inclusion surgery ( obesity center , Hôpital Louis Mourier ) . Analyses adipose tissue perform INSERM U1048 focus vitro approach cell adipose tissue ( mature adipocytes , endothelial cell , progenitor cell immuno-inflammatory cell ) . This project permit good understand pathogenicity associate excessive growth visceral adipose tissue may reveal new therapeutic target limit obesity-associated pathology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective : The main objective 1 ) compare state senescence subcutaneous versus visceral adipose tissue 2 ) define senescent cell population subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue morbidly obese patient . Secondary objective : Secondary objective 1 ) precise whether state senescence attributable microenvironment , 2 ) determine impact age cellular function , 3 ) establish link state senescence subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue obesity-associated pathology .</detailed_description>
