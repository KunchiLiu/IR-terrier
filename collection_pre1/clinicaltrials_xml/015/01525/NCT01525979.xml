	<detailed_description>An estimate 30 % 66 % stroke victim poor upper extremity function 6 month stroke , contribute long-term disability patient . Training affect UE stroke patient thus mainstay neurorehabilitation . The goal intervention restore motor daily function . New therapeutic strategy develop base principle neurorehabilitation motor learning . The need comparative effectiveness research innovative treatment call promote evidence-based practice translational science stroke motor rehabilitation . Wolf Whitall call rigorous comparison unilateral bilateral training . McCombe Waller Whitall also indicate importance combine unilateral bilateral training . For low-functioning patient , robot-assisted training possible approach . Identifying possible determinant unilateral bilateral training outcome may also elucidate factor influence treatment outcome . Outcome measure require good clinimetric property measure effect rehabilitation strategy . The long-term objective conduct comparative efficacy research identify possible mechanism relative effectiveness exist rehabilitation approach fully defined- , evidence-based , theory-grounded approach . This propose project aim ( 1 ) compare effect dose-matched unilateral v bilateral vs unilateral combine bilateral upper limb rehabilitation base task-related practice ; ( 2 ) compare effect unilateral vs bilateral training base robot-assisted device ; ( 3 ) study predictor treatment outcomes clinimetric property biomechanical measure . The outcome measure span spectrum health-related functioning , include motor neural control , movement performance , daily function , quality life . Motor neural control mechanism involve movement strategy , muscle force output , brain reorganization evaluate use kinematic , electromyographic ( EMG ) , kinetic analysis , also functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examination . Clinical outcome include movement performance , daily function , quality life , measure MYOTON-3 , Modified Ashworth Scale , Fugl-Meyer Assessment , Wolf Motor Function Test , Functional Independence Measure , ABILHAND questionnaire , accelerometer , Stroke Impact Scale . This 5-year project recruit estimate 200 patient stroke . For Part 1 , 120 patient mild-to-moderate motor impairment randomize dose-matched unilateral , bilateral , combine group . For Part 1 , 80 stroke patient moderate motor impairment randomize dose-matched unilateral bilateral robot-assisted therapy group . Treatment regimens design ensure patient 3 group Part 1 2 group Part 2 receive equivalent intensity treatment ( 5 days/week 1.5 hours/day 4 consecutive week ) . The intervention provide 4 hospital . Two certify occupational therapist train administration 5 type rehabilitation protocol PI co-PI complete write competency test subject treatment . Biomechanical ( kinematic , EMG , kinetic ) fMRI examination perform , immediately 4-week intervention period , 3-month follow-up period ( fMRI examination follow-up ) . Clinical measure administer , midterm ( 2 week intervention ) , immediately , 3 month intervention . At least 3 examiner ( 1 research assistant , 1 graduate student , 1 post-doc fellow ) blind group allocation charge biomechanical , fMRI , clinical measure . Each type measure require 2 evaluator collaborate complete assessment . Before allow work participant , examiner 's competence assess PI co-PI , interrater reliability clinical test establish . Multivariate analysis covariance use examine change outcome measure function treatment control baseline data . Multiple regression model establish determine potential predictor different functional outcome intervention ( unilateral bilateral training approach ) . The responsiveness validity biomechanical measure relevant clinimetric scrutiny examine index standardize response mean Spearman correlation coefficient . The clinical important difference biomechanical parameter determine anchor-based distribution-based clinical important difference estimate .</detailed_description>
