	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Temozolomide Bevacizumab Metastatic Unresectable Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate combination capecitabine temozolomide bevacizumab metastatic unresectable neuroendocrine tumor improve response rate ( RR ) 62 % historical control ( null RR 40 % true RR 65 % ) . II . Assess toxicity use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) use Kaplan-Meier analysis . II . To assess O6-methyl guanine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase ( MGMT ) central pathology ( path ) review . III . To assess serum hormone marker level . IV . To evaluate compute tomography ( CT ) Perfusion tool predict early therapeutic response . ( Optional ) V. To bank serum future correlative analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 , capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 , temozolomide PO daily ( QD ) day 10-14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor consider well moderately differentiate 2 . Patients must metastatic unresectable disease 3 . Patients prior surgical resection develop radiological clinical evidence metastatic cancer require separate histological cytological confirmation metastatic disease unless interval &gt; 5 year elapse primary surgery development metastatic disease . Clinicians consider biopsy lesion establish diagnosis metastatic disease substantial clinical ambiguity regard nature source apparent metastasis . 4 . Prior sunitinib everolimus permit . A washout period 2 week require prior first dose study . 5 .
