	<brief_summary>Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) special form treatment pinpoint high dos radiation directly cancer . Standard radiation ( photon radiation ) commonly use SBRT treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . Proton beam radiation special type radiation available institution US previously use SBRT treat NSCLC . The use proton SBRT may improve accuracy treatment may help minimize dose deliver unnecessarily healthy tissue . In study , investigator evaluate safety effectiveness proton-based SBRT early-stage NSCLC locate periphery lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo electronic navigational bronchoscopy ( ENB ) three marker place around tumor guide delivery proton beam radiation precision accuracy . Subjects receive CT scan obtain image plan radiation treatment . Proton radiation deliver daily ( 4 5 consecutive day ) outpatient basis Massachusetts General Hospital . After final dose proton radiation subject follow 5 year . Subjects ask return 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year . Subjects receive chest CT , tumor assessment CT PET , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test physical exam .</detailed_description>
