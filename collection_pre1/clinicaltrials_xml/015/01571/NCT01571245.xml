	<brief_summary>Objective psychophysiologic reactivity data may useful predict post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) treatment response . Given variety PTSD treatments lack clearly superior treatment , reliable valid approach predict treatment response need . Specific Aims : 1 ) . Evaluate clinical utility psychophysiologic reactivity measure predict overall PTSD symptom response among OEF/OIF/OND ( Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn ) veterans receive treatment PTSD . 2 ) . Evaluate clinical utility psychophysiologic reactivity measure predict psychosocial function health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) response among OEF/OIF/OND veteran treatment PTSD . Exploratory ) . Develop psychophysiologic , neuropsychological , and/or self-report model predict PTSD symptom response pharmacotherapy , psychotherapy , combine pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy . The investigator divide psychophysiologic reactivity predictor two group : heart rate variability attentional bias ( eye gaze track modify Stroop ) . The investigator collect observational longitudinal data treatment-seeking sample 50 OEF/OIF/OND veteran PTSD recruit Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System ( CAVHS ) Mental Health Clinics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject complete baseline assessment include self-report data psychophysiologic reactivity measure . Trained research assistant collect psychophysiologic reactivity data . The investigator collect 3-month data in-person . At 6-months , self-report data collect in-person . If study participant unable complete 6-month assessment person investigator attempt collect self-report data phone . The study instrument previously administer telephone . The project coordinator schedule track participant use telephone . The project coordinator call participant remind follow-up appointment . The consent form also include name phone number least one contact person . Psychophysiologic reactivity measure collect first minimize fatigue . In addition , psychophysiologic reactivity measure context dependent investigator want psychophysiologic measure prim symptom reporting . Heart rate variability data collect baseline five minute prior test continue eye gaze track modify Stroop test .</detailed_description>
