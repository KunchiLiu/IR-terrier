	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect forearm exercise forearm bone density post-menopausal woman without primary hyperparathyroidism . The investigator hypothesize forearm exercise increase forearm bone density patient primary hyperparathyroidism patient without primary hyperparathyroidism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) , disease characterize excess parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) high blood calcium , one common endocrine disorder . PHPT see often post-menopausal woman . Kidney stone bone deformity prominent manifestation disease past , however , PHPT primarily asymptomatic due incidental detection high blood calcium level . Many patient PHPT , however , low bone mineral density ( BMD ) bone mass measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , primarily forearm . There effective medical therapy increase bone density forearm patient PHPT . PTH build break bone , pathways PTH mediates action begin identify . Prior research suggest mechanical load shift PTH towards build bone . Arm exercise attractive option treatment low forearm BMD patient PHPT since often site affect excess PTH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion primary hyperparathyroidism group : 1 . Primary hyperparathyroidism ( define elevate serum calcium concomitantly elevate inappropriately normal PTH ) 2 . Female sex , postmenopausal status least five year , age 4580 3 . English Spanishspeaking 4 . DXA Tscore less 1.0 onethird radius 5 . Physically capable exercise 6 . 25hydroxyvitamin D &gt; 20 ng/mL . The latter inclusion criterion lead enrollment individual whose vitamin D store frankly low . We feel , however , good study subject usual state rather replace vitamin D could add another variable would complicate pilot study . Inclusion criterion osteopenic control : 1 . Female sex , postmenopausal status least five year age 4580 2 . English Spanishspeaking 3 . DXA Tscore less 1.0 onethird radius 4 . Physically capable exercise 5 . Normal serum calcium PTH level 6 . 25hydroxyvitamin D &gt; 20 ng/mL 1 . Men , premenopausal woman , woman le age 45 great age 80 2 . Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 3 . Current prior use bisphosphonates ( alendronate risedronate ( within 12 month ) , ibandronate ( within 6 month ) , bisphosphonate ( 2 year ) 4 . Current use cinacalcet 5 . Current prior use estrogen replacement therapy ( within 2 year ) 6 . Planned parathyroidectomy ( within one year ) 7 . Planned initiation bisphosphonates 8 . DXA Tscore great 1.0 onethird radius 9 . Cardiovascular disease uncontrolled hypertension 10 . Exerciselimiting pulmonary disease 11 . Malignancy nonmelanomatous skin cancer microscopic thyroid cancer ( within 5 year ) 12 . Renal failure 13 . Secondary hyperparathyroidism 14 . Celiac disease 15 . Physical/orthopedic disability neurologic disorder vasculopathies would place subject risk limit ability perform exercise ( eg . arthritis , carpal tunnel syndrome , rotator cuff injury , etc ) 16 . Moderate high physical activity ( category 2 3 ) assess IPAQ questionnaire . This latter exclusion criterion measure baseline physical activity look exclude would lower likelihood benefit baseline participation exercise program . 17 . Protected individual ( institutionalize ) , prisoner , prospective participant might able give voluntary informed consent .</criteria>
