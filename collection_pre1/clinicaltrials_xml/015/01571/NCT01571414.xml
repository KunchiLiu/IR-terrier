	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Drug Interaction PA-824 , Investigational Tuberculosis Medication , Together With Efavirenz , Ritonavir-Boosted Lopinavir , Rifampin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB global public health threat . In 2009 , estimate 9.4 million case TB 1.8 million death disease . TB treatment regimen often lengthy complex , multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) TB emerge worldwide epidemic . TB also one common cause death among people infect HIV . PA-824 experimental drug develop treatment TB . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) drug interaction PA-824 EFV , LPV/r , RIF . This study enroll healthy adult infect HIV TB . Participants enrol one three arm , Arms 1 2 consist two group . Participants Arm 1 randomly assign receive PA-824 alone EFV alone follow EFV plus PA-824 one two sequence . Participants Arm 2 randomly assign receive PA-824 alone LPV/r alone follow LPV/r plus PA-824 one two sequence . For participant Arms 1 2 , 14-day washout period treatment , participant receive medication . Participants Arm 3 receive PA-824 alone , follow RIF alone , RIF plus PA-824 . Participants Arms 1 2 attend outpatient study visit study entry either Days 3 , 22 , 29 Days 7 , 36 , 39 , depend group . Participants Arm 3 attend outpatient study visit study entry Days 3 , 10 , 15 . At study visit , participant undergo physical examination , vital sign measurement , medication medical history review , blood collection . Participants complete medication symptom diary throughout study . All participant also admit inpatient clinical research unit two three time study , depend arm enrol . Each inpatient visit last 1 2 day . During inpatient visit , participant undergo several blood collection throughout day ; select visit also include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Participants Arms 1 2 receive last dose assign medication Day 42 . Participants Arm 3 receive last dose assign medication Day 21 . A final study visit occur participant 1 2 week later .</detailed_description>
