	<brief_title>BKM120 + mFOLFOX6 Advanced Solid Tumors With Expansion Cohort Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , multicenter , open-label Phase I clinical trial design establish safety tolerability dose escalate BKM120 combine mFOLFOX6 define MTD BKM120 combination . Secondary objective estimate response rate , Progression Free Survival rate , Overall Survival rate , treatment Maximum Tolerated Dose BKM120 combination mFOLFOX6 patient advance solid tumor metastatic pancreatic cancer . Eligible patient treat BKM120 orally ( PO ) , per day ( QD ) combination mFOLFOX6 administer intravenously ( IV ) every 2 week Days 1 15 cycle use standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme . Each cycle repeat every 4 week ( 28 day ) . FOLFOX6 treatment follow : Oxaliplatin : 85 mg/m2 IV , Leucovorin : 400 mg/m2 IV , 5FU bolus : 400 mg/m2 IV 5FU infusion : 2400 mg/m2 IV . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( AEs ) , treatment may continue : disease progression , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , unacceptable AE ( ) , patient decides withdraw study , general specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator .</detailed_description>
