	<brief_summary>Today accumulate evidence animal experiment regeneration induce spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Consequently near future , new therapeutic approach induce regeneration include treatment patient SCI . The aim proposal provide require clinical basis implementation novel interventional therapy . The establishment combine clinical , functional neurophysiological measure qualitative quantitative assessment spinal cord function patient SCI different stage rehabilitation represent basic requirement monitor significant effect new treatment . Therefore , several European Paraplegic Centres involve rehabilitation acute traumatic SCI patient build close collaboration standardise assessment . The aim get knowledge natural recovery spinal cord lesion large population patient sense historical control group bring new standardise assessment tool clinical setting .</brief_summary>
