	<brief_summary>- Hypothesis 1 : Food allergy associate poor growth correct nutrition intervention . - More 10 % child multiple food allergy weight-for-age z-score less - 2 diagnosis . The z-score measure distance mean value , 50th percentile growth chart . A z-score less - 2 indicate child underweight . - Growth parameter child multiple food allergy improve intervention team include dietitian allergist . - Hypothesis 2 : Food allergy associate low micronutrient intake correct nutrition intervention . More 30 % child multiple food allergy consume less 67 % Dietary Reference Intake least one macronutrient micronutrient diagnosis . - Macronutrient micronutrient intake increase intervention team include dietitian allergist . â€¢ Hypothesis 3 : Food allergy relate behavioral feeding problem correct nutrition intervention . - At least 25 % child multiple food allergy behavioral feed problem diagnosis . - Prevalence behavioral feeding problem decrease nutrition intervention .</brief_summary>
