	<detailed_description>GSK573719 monotherapy GSK573719/vilanterol combination currently development treatment COPD . This study ass pharmacokinetics safety inhale GSK573719 GSK573719/vilanterol ( VI ) healthy subject subject severe renal impairment . Nine subject severe renal impairment ( define Clcr &lt; 30mL/min ) recruit along healthy control subject ( define Clcr &gt; 80mL/min match severe renal impairment subject base gender , ethnicity , body mass index ( ±15 % ) age ( ±5 year ) ) . The result study provide guidance use GSK573719 GSK573719/VI severe renally impaired patient .</detailed_description>

Healthy Subjects : Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitor Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin less equal 1.5x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance great 80mL/min calculate CockcroftGault equation use serum creatinine Renally Impaired subject : ALT le 2xULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin less equal 1.5xULN Creatinine clearance le 30mL/min calculated CockcroftGault equation use serum creatinine . Subjects renal insufficiency must stable renal function define less equal 25 % difference creatinine clearance assess two occasion . Renal function base estimate creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) calculate CockcroftGault equation use serum creatinine obtain two occasion separate least 4 week within last 3 month Suffered low respiratory tract infection 4 week screen visit A supine mean heart rate outside range 4090 beat per minute ( BPM ) screen A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen A positive test HIV antibody Current chronic history liver disease , include documented cirrhosis history consistent diagnosis cirrhosis , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day Use nephrotoxic medication 4 week dose Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period Pregnant female determine positive serum urine hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating females The subject treat diagnosed depression within six month screen history significant psychiatric illness Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol Subject mentally legally incapacitated Subjects smoke history great 10 cigarette per day regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product , within 6 month prior screen History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation .
