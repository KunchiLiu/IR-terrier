	<brief_summary>This prospective study intend compare analgesic efficacy , preservation lower extremity motor power side-effect profile L2 Paravertebral lumbar plexus approach compare Posterior nerve stimulation guide lumbar plexus approach , continuous local anesthetic infusion postoperative analgesia Total Hip Arthroplasty . The L2 Paravertebral technique lumbar plexus block , part multimodal pain treatment , could cost-effective alternative equal profile analgesic efficacy motor power spar great promotion early achievement postoperative physical therapy goal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous L2 Paravertebral Block Versus Continuous Lumbar Plexus Block Postoperative Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nerve stimulator guide technique continuous lumbar plexus block ( LPB ) accept standard care University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) management postoperative analgesia Total Hip Arthroplasty . Over 900 continuous lumbar plexus block perform UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital within last year alone . Continuous thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB ) also commonly perform UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside . Over 2000 perform annually wide variety surgical procedure . Recently author suggest lumbar paravertebral block ( LPVB ) may represent alternative approach lumbar plexus . Indeed L2 paravertebral approach lumbar plexus describe provide adequate postoperative analgesia follow hip arthroscopic surgery . However , date , prospective direct comparison L2 Lumbar plexus approach posterior approach postoperative analgesia Total Hip Arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
