	<detailed_description>Reactions acute exposure high altitude process acclimatization scientific interest since many year . High altitude illness specify three different entity : acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) , high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) high altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) . Prevalence AMS know 10 20 % altitude 4000 5000m , increase significantly high altitude . The prevalence depend ascent rate , individual susceptibility physical exhaustion . Although mechanisms lead high altitude illness yet completely clear progress make . It well accept excessive pulmonary hypertension may lead HAPE . Furthermore , rise evidence endothelial dysfunction involve disease progression . Some cellular molecular mechanism acute ( hypobaric ) hypoxia , possibly lead endothelial dysfunction , study experimental field setting . Paradoxical increase systemic oxidative stress see hypoxic condition , high altitude stay . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) could demonstrate many endothelial disorder capillary leakage syndrome septicaemia , myocardial infarct stroke . Furthermore , coagulation activation might result endothelial dysfunction also amplify endothelial interruption . Still , knowledge concern effect hypoxia general also concern oxidative stress vitro study ( e.g . cancer cell ) . In context high altitude expedition human subject safely submit prolonged hypoxia explore generation ROS extent procoagulatory state . Objective The purpose study confirm excessive oxidative stress find previous study 2005 investigate whether oxidative stress high altitude exposure modify dietary supplementation specific antioxidant . Moreover , like study mechanism coagulation activation assess extent thrombocytic endothelial microparticles . Methods After approval study regional ethic committee , write informed consent obtain 30 healthy volunteer ( low land resident mountaineer experience , age 18-65 year ) . After baseline testing , double-blind randomization 2 group 15 person take place . One group receive oral medication vitamin E , vitamin C , vitamin A acetylcystein daily , group provide identical appear placebo preparation . Substitution start 2 month expedition . After examination `` ground 0 '' Zurich ( 409m ) member underwent test Base Camp ( 3550m ) , twice advanced Base Camp ( 4550m ) , Camp 1 ( 5430m ) , Camp 2 ( 6265m ) . Beside blood sampling , clinical examination perform . Metabolomics , mass-spectrometry base analysis , measurement oxidative stress , perform . In subgroup microparticles detect annexin V base ELISA flow cytometry use specific antibody .</detailed_description>
