	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Prime-Boost HIV Vaccine Regimen Healthy , HIV-Uninfected , Vaccinia-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although multiple candidate HIV vaccine study , yet effective preventive HIV vaccine . This study test safety immune response prime-boost regimen two HIV vaccine : two injection GEO-D03 DNA prim vaccine follow either two three boost injection MVA/HIV62B ( MVA62B ) vaccine . This study enroll 48 healthy , HIV-1-uninfected , vaccinia-naive adult 1 3 group . Participants within group randomly assign receive either study vaccine regimen ( 40 total participant ) placebo vaccine regimen ( 8 total participant ) . The total study duration approximately 45 month . Participants Group 1 attend clinic visit 14 month follow annual health contact , total 3 year initial study injection . Participants Group 2 attend clinic visit 22 month follow annual health contact , total 3 year initial study injection . Participants Group 3 attend clinic visit 20 month follow annual health contact , total 3 year initial study injection . Participants Group 1 17 study visit , participant Group 2 23 visit , participant Group 3 21 visit . At screen visit , participant give medical history undergo complete physical exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , urine collection , blood collection , interview , HIV test , pregnancy test ( participant bear female ) . Participants receive intramuscular ( IM ) vaccination ( study vaccine placebo ) deltoid schedule assign group . The vaccination schedule follow : Group 1 participant receive injection Days 0 , 56 , 112 , 168 , 224 ; Group 2 participant receive injection Days 0 , 56 , 112 , 168 , 303 ; Group 3 participant receive injection Days 0 , 56 , 112 , 224 . On vaccination visit , participant also undergo abbreviated physical exam , pregnancy test ( participant bear female ) , risk-reduction counseling , blood collection . Immediately follow vaccination , participant remain clinic observation 30 minute ; participant give post-vaccination symptom log instruct complete . Follow-up visit consist brief physical exam , blood collection , interview ; follow-up visit may also consist urine collection , HIV test , ECG . The last clinic visit Day 425 participant Group 1 , Day 667 participant Group 2 , Day 607 participant Group 3 ; visit , participant contact annual health follow-up consist confirm vital status , collect safety information , report new HIV diagnosis pregnancy . A clinic visit require HIV confirmatory test necessary .</detailed_description>
