	<detailed_description>PHASE B - ENROLLMENT BEGIN JANUARY 2016 Background : The reason initiation continuation use illicit substance multifactorial ; however , individual appear resistant . One set determinant lie environment . In ongoing study , examine environmental concomitant behavior individual drug treatment . In study , examine environmental factor may impact initiation , addiction , treatment seek among great population large ( non-drug-users , current opioid/stimulant user , current marijuana user ) . Scientific goal : ( 1 ) To assess , cross-sectionally baseline , difference stress , social stability , mental physical health among three main neighborhood-matched group current opioid/stimulant user , current marijuana user , nondrug user ; ( 2 ) ass , longitudinally , mediator 12-month change drug-misuse status three group ; ( 3 ) provide neighborhood-matched control group non-drug-using individual , Unclassified/former drug user , current opioid/stimulant drug user seek treatment ongoing environmental study individual drug treatment ; ( 4 ) explore possible role genetics interplay environment regard drug use initiation , addiction , treatment seek among study group , ( 5 ) ass EMA report drug use psychosocial stress well real-time environmental risk exposure non-treatment seek and/or nondrug use population compare ongoing environmental study individual drug treatment , Participant population : We enroll 500 participant Phase B study total enrollment ( Phase A + Phase B ) 1250 participant . Target enrollment include 25 % woman 70 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design method : This three-group observational study cross-sectional component longitudinal component : participant assess two visit space approximately 12 month apart . The three main group : ( 1 ) non-drug-users ( NDUs ) , ( 2 ) current opioid/stimulant user [ ( COSUs ) comprise two subgroup : treatment seek ( COSU-TS ) non-treatment seek ( COSU-NTS ) ] , current marijuana user ( CMUs ) . All group roughly match socioeconomic status neighborhood residence . Each participant attend 3-5-hour initial study visit 3-5-hour 12 month visit # 2 . The study visit include questionnaire component biological-sample component . Questionnaires cover substance use , stress , social stability ( include healthcare access/utilization , neighborhood environment ) , physical mental health ( include quality life , HIV , trauma ) . The biological component consist sample urine ( drug abuse cotinine ) , breath ( alcohol carbon monoxide ) . Blood genetics obtain Visit 1 Visit 2 . The primary outcome measure lifetime substance-misuse history ( cross-sectional component ) change drug-use status across 12 month visit ( longitudinal component ) . Secondary outcome measure include : biological assessment drug use ; medical , psychiatric , social determinant health ; impulsivity decision make factor . Individuals choose return 12-month Visit # 2 ask complete 45-minute telephone visit # 2 . In HON EMA/GMA secondary study participant carry smartphone GPS unit ( necessary ) 4 week complete Visit 1 . Event-triggered entry initiate participant ( 1 ) time use drug ( COSU ) marijuana and/or alcohol ( NDU , CMU , Unclassified ) ( 2 ) time feel overwhelm , anxious , stressed usual . Participants also make 5 random-signal-triggered recording per day one brief end day record . During study participant also come clinic week complete compliance visit . Benefits participant and/or society : There benefit participant . The knowledge gain may benefit society provide data health outcome drug-using non-drug-using individual natural history drug use neighborhood . Risks participant : This minimal-risk study , consist standard physical questionnaire-based assessment . PHASE A ENROLLMENT END DECEMBER 2015 Background . The reason initiation continuation use illicit substance multifactorial ; however , individual appear resistant . One set determinant lie environment . In ongoing study , examine environmental concomitant behavior individual drug treatment . In study , examine environmental factor may impact initiation , addiction , treatment seek among great population large ( non-drug-users , former drug user , current opioid/stimulant user seek treatment , current opioid/stimulant user seek treatment , current marijuana user ) . Using participant , also investigate lipid biomarkers predictor relapse ; portion study collaboration preclinical investigator identify possible lipid fingerprint cocaine sensitization . The result could inform prevention effort , enhance treatment intervention , improve substance use outcome . Scientific goal : ( 1 ) To assess , cross-sectionally baseline , difference stress , social stability , mental physical health among three neighborhood-matched group current opioid/stimulant user , current marijuana user , nondrug user ; ( 2 ) ass , longitudinally , mediator 12-month change drug-misuse status three group ; ( 3 ) provide neighborhood-matched control group non-drug-using individual , former drug user , current drug user seek treatment ongoing environmental study individual drug treatment ; ( 4 ) ass lipid biomarkers predictor drug relapse eventual goal develop screen assay inform personalization treatment , ( 5 ) explore possible role genetics interplay environment regard drug use initiation , addiction , treatment seek among study group , ( 6 ) test blood serum urine presence several disease-associated autoantibody , include ANCA , ANA , antiophospholipid antibody , relation presence levamisole ( common adulterant cocaine ) ; ( 7 ) ass EMA report drug use psychosocial stress well real-time environmental risk exposure non-treatment seek and/or nondrug use population compare ongoing environmental study individual drug treatment , Participant population : We enroll 750 community-dwelling individual ( least 300 anticipate provide 12-month Visit # 2 data 3 main study group ) . Target enrollment include 25 % woman 70 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design method : This three-group observational study cross-sectional component longitudinal component : participant assess two visit space approximately 12 month apart . The three group : ( 1 ) non-drug-users ( NDUs ) , ( 2 ) current opioid/stimulant user ( COSUs ) , current marijuana user ( CMUs ) . All group roughly match socioeconomic status neighborhood residence . Each participant attend 5-hour initial study visit 5-hour 12 month visit # 2 . The study visit include questionnaire component biological-sample component . Questionnaires cover substance use , stress , social stability ( include healthcare access utilization ) , physical mental health ( include quality life , dental health , pain , sexual function , sleep , HIV , trauma ) . The biological component consist sample urine ( drug abuse , cotinine , microalbumin ) , breath ( alcohol carbon monoxide ) , saliva ( alpha-amylase cortisol ) , blood ( liver function , kidney function , HGBA1C , DHEA-S , lipid , CRP , pre-albumin , cortisol , lipid biomarkers ) . Blood genetics obtain Visit 1 Visit 2 . Blood urine levamisole secondary study collect Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 . The primary outcome measure lifetime substance-misuse history ( cross-sectional component ) change drug-use status across 12 month visit ( longitudinal component ) . Secondary outcome measure include : biological assessment drug use ; lipid biomarkers ; medical , psychiatric , social determinant health ; hematologic marker correspond medical condition ; measure cumulative stress burden ( allostatic load ) ; personality assessment ; relationship among level autoantibody , levamisole , cocaine metabolite . Individuals choose return 12-month Visit # 2 ask complete 45-minute telephone visit # 2 . Individuals Group 1 ( NDU ) also offer optional 8-hour laboratory stress session ( 472 Stress Exposure Response Session A : 472 SEARSA ) . The 472 SEARSA session occur separate day , separate consent , consist color-vision testing Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task ( PASAT-C ) , psychological stressor . The 472 SEARSA session replicate 09-DA-N020 Stress Exposure Response Session A , conduct methadone-maintained opioid-dependent participant , thereby provide non-drug-using neighborhood-matched control group comparison stressor reactivity color vision . In HON EMA/GMA secondary study participant carry smartphone GPS unit ( necessary ) 4 week complete Visit 1 . Event-triggered entry initiate participant ( 1 ) time use drug ( 2 ) time feel overwhelm , anxious , stressed usual . Participants also make 5 random-signal-triggered recording per day one brief end day record . During study participant also come clinic week provide urine breath sample , complete questionnaire , upload data device . Benefits participant and/or society : There benefit participant . The knowledge gain may benefit society provide data health outcome drug-using non-drug-using individual natural history drug use neighborhood . Risks participant : This minimal-risk study , consist standard physical questionnaire-based assessment . Participants undergo PASAT-C expect experience mild , transient stress .</detailed_description>
