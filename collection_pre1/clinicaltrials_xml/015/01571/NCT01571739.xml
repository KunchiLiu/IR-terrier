	<brief_summary>Background : - Tuberculosis ( TB ) lead cause death worldwide . Those exposed TB bacteria become sick say latent TB . Many people latent TB get sick , people develop active TB become sick . Much know treat diagnose active TB , little know best way treat latent TB . Researchers also want know risk latent TB develop active TB , whether possible test risk . Objectives : - To test possible method determine person risk develop active TB . Eligibility : - Individuals 20 60 year age ( 1 ) active TB , ( 2 ) expose someone active TB past 9 month , ( 3 ) expose TB . Design : - Participants separate group base exposure TB . - Healthy participant expose TB answer question medical history . They also provide blood urine sample . - Participants active TB physical exam medical history . They provide blood , urine , sputum sample , chest x-ray . They treat standard care active TB . Some participant active TB may additional test part study . - Participants expose TB latent TB physical exam medical history . They provide blood , urine , sputum sample , chest x-ray . They ask return five clinic visit next 12 month repeat test . They may also additional chest image study depend study need . - Some exposed participant may expose drug-resistant TB . These participant receive drug isoniazid take regular schedule help prevent latent TB become active TB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficacy treat tuberculin skin test ( TST ) positive , interferon gamma release assay ( IGRA ) positive , contact tuberculosis ( TB ) case prevent progression disease well establish . However length treatment , toxicity associate currently use regimen , mean risk may outweigh benefit treatment completion rate poor . In addition , proven regimens available contact multidrug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) case . Because 2 % contact develop active TB 1 year surrogate marker available , drug trial assess novel treatment typically require thousand subject follow many year . ( 18F ) -fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) may prove useful surrogate target chemoprophylaxis well mean rapidly evaluate novel prophylactic regime future study . Up 40 % immune-sensitized TB contact normal chest radiograph ( CXR ) abnormalities conventional chest CT. FDG-PET/CT allow characterization metabolic activity lesion also likely reveal significantly increase metabolic activity within regional lymph node may otherwise anatomically normal . Based previous study , predict 65 % contact combine chest PET/CT abnormalities 50 % contact treat , increase FDG uptake resolve treatment . By contrast , PET screen study demonstrate abnormal pulmonary FDG uptake occur 0.9 % healthy individual . The development biomarkers predictive disease progression also highly desirable , similar reason evaluate challenge . This novel approach use FDG-PET/CT benchmark dynamic immunological , transcriptional , metabolic change occur early tuberculosis infection , hope accelerate biomarker discovery . In study propose evaluate prediction order lay foundation future study .</detailed_description>
