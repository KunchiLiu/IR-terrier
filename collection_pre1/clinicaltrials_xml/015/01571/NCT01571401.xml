	<brief_summary>Objectives : The purpose study find new program help kidney cancer survivor ( KCS ) increase physical activity ( PA ) improve quality life ( QoL ) . Methods : Fifty KCS recruit previous study use Alberta Cancer Registry . Participants undergo submaximal exercise testing , physical function test measure height weight , complete baseline end physical activity program ( 12 week ) . Participants also complete questionnaire PA QoL baseline , supervised portion program ( 4 week ) , end entire program ( 12 week ) . Following baseline assessment , participant randomly assign either : ( 1 ) supervise physical activity plus traditional exercise counseling ( 2 ) supervise physical activity plus behavioural counseling . Participants ask attend six individual supervise exercise counseling session 4-week period PA specialist eventually taper home-based program end program . Implications : The investigator hope PA intervention KCS feasible result meaningful improvement health outcomes translate public health practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trying Activity Kidney Cancer Survivors ( TRACKS ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Despite report benefit physical activity ( PA ) , majority cancer survivor meet public health PA guideline . Most PA intervention study use supervised exercise demonstrate benefit . However , study also find PA decline significantly supervise intervention complete . Consequently , intervention need ensure long term adherence short term supervise exercise intervention . Although several behaviour change intervention support positive increase PA , study date examine effect add behavioural counsel standard supervise exercise program study focus kidney cancer survivor ( KCS ) . Objectives : The primary purpose Trying Activity Kidney Cancer Survivors ( TRACKS ) Trial compare effect supervise physical activity program plus traditional exercise counseling ( SPA ) versus supervise physical activity plus motivationally-enhanced behavioural counseling ( SPA+BC ) change self-reported moderate/vigorous PA baseline , post-intervention , 12-week follow-up among KCS . The secondary outcome change self-reported quality life ( QoL ) , body composition ( anthropometric measure ) , cardiorespiratory fitness , physical function , motivational construct Theory Planned Behaviour ( TPB ) construct . Methods : The study pilot two-armed , randomize control trial 50 KCS . KCS recruit previous study use Alberta Cancer Registry . Eligibility include : ) 18-80 year age , b ) diagnose Stage I-IIIa kidney cancer , g ) interest increase physical activity . Following screening procedure prior randomization , participant undergo submaximal exercise test treadmill ensure able exercise safely moderate-to-vigorous intensity . Randomization occur baseline measurement complete . The goal intervention , base current public health recommendation , gradually increase participant least 60 minute moderate intensity PA 30 minute vigorous intensity PA minimum 150 minute moderate intensity PA 75 minute vigorous intensity PA per week . Participants arm provide six individual supervise exercise session physical activity specialist taper unsupervised program end intervention . Participants assign SPA group give individualized prescription moderate-to-vigorous intensity . They also receive traditional exercise counsel teach proper PA technique , monitor intensity , progress PA safely effectively achieve public health PA guideline . For SPA+BC group , participant receive supervise PA session addition six individual `` face-to-face '' behavioural counseling session physical activity specialist . These behaviour counsel session include train behavioural strategy promote adoption long-term maintenance PA. Measurements primary secondary endpoint assess baseline ( pre-intervention ) , 4 week ( post-intervention ) , 12 week follow-up . Conclusion : The study result use determine behavior change intervention KCS base TPB result potentially meaningful improvement PA select health outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening evaluation conduct interested participant eligibility criterion include follow : ) age 18 80 year age , histologically confirm kidney cancer ( Stage IIIIa ) ; b ) ability willingness effectively communicate study coordinator complete questionnaire involve study English ; c ) able attend supervise PA session plan away three consecutive day duration program ; ) interest increase PA least 60 minute moderate PA 30 minute vigorous PA . Following screening procedure prior randomization , consent participant deem eligible undergo submaximal exercise test ensure able exercise safely moderatetovigorous intensity . Two stage treadmill test must successfully complete acceptable heart rate blood pressure responses remain baseline test conduct include physical function test , anthropometric testing , PA behaviour , quality life , determinant questionnaire . The researcher remove participant study early reason cancer recurrence , doctor feel participant unable participate physical activity program and/or participate follow fitness testing , and/or two stage treadmill test complete .</criteria>
