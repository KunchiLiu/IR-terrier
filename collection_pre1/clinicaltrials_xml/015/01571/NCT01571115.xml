	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION : The primary insomnia , accord concept DSM IV , disorder characterize difficulty initiate maintain sleep , wake early non-restorative sleep , result loss daily function patient , lack attention , concentration memory , fatigue , moodiness irritability potentially associate change sleep architecture , especially reduction slow-wave sleep . The widely use therapy treatment insomnia drug , currently resistive exercise important non-pharmacological intervention know provide enough increase slow wave sleep , improve parameter sleep , well reduce symptom anxiety directly associate framework insomnia . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate effect chronic resistive exercise sleep pattern , profile mood quality life patient chronic primary insomnia . METHODOLOGY : 30 patient select ( male female ) chronic primary insomnia . ( Clinical diagnosis base DSM-IV ) refer ambulatory sleep disorder Sleep Institute - AFIP . The protocol conduct Center Psychobiology Exercise ( CEPE ) AFIP Sleep Institute . Volunteers randomize 2 group 15 participant , hold resistive exercise stretch exercise . This study consist three assessment : Pre-intervention ( baseline ) , intermediate Rating ( 2 month ) post-intervention ( end 4 month ) . In program resistive exercise hold 48 session involve upper low limb , abdominal paraspinal region . It initially use relative intensity 50 % 1-RM . After 2 month train intensity increase 60 % 1-RM . Each exercise conduct three set 12 repetition , interval 30 second set one minute exercise . The total duration training session approximately 50 minute . Before start training , participant hold 5 minute stretch warm bicycle ergometer ( Life Cycle 9100 ) treadmill ( Life Fitness 9100 ) period . After session , volunteer perform repeated stretch start training . The group submit follow practice stretch protocol perform Tworoger et al . consist 48 session stretch 60 minute low intensity , three time week . The session begin 5 minute walk around room , follow 45 minute stretch exercise involve upper low limb , 8 10 type region end 10 minute relaxation . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : The variable sleep , body composition maximal repetition test analyze use software Statistica 7.0 ( StaSoft , INC ) . The appropriate statistical test , parametric nonparametric , choose accord data sample group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY : 30 patient select ( male female ) chronic primary insomnia . ( Clinical diagnosis base DSM-IV ) refer ambulatory sleep disorder Sleep Institute - AFIP . The protocol conduct Center Psychobiology Exercise ( CEPE ) AFIP Sleep Institute . Each patient undergo initial interview aim clarify objective procedure protocol , well obtain signature Consent Participation Research . During interview , questionnaire apply ( Sleep Quality Index Pittsburgh ) ( 68 ) assessment subjective sleep complaint depression scale ( Beck Depression Inventory , BDI ) ( 69 ) . Then patient submit general clinical examination , blood collection conduct examination rest electrocardiograms . Later , subject polysomnographic procedure . Volunteers randomize 3 group 10 participant , hold resistive exercise stretch exercise control group . Inclusion criterion : age 30 55 year , clinical diagnosis primary insomnia ( DSM-IV , ICSD , 2005 ) , complaint insomnia period longer 6 month least one day complain prejudice result insomnia ( moodiness , irritability and/or cognitive impairment ) . The non-inclusion criterion : use psychoactive drug , history psychiatric disorder , shift worker , people sleep disorder and/or depression , significant abnormality laboratory test clinical trial apnea/hypopnea index - AHI &gt; 15 , present rate periodic leg movement - IMPP &gt; 15 , show abnormality heart test ( rest exercise ECG ) blood might impede practice physical exercise practice regular physical exercise . This study consist three assessment : Pre-intervention ( baseline ) , intermediate Rating ( 2 month ) post-intervention ( end 4 month ) . In evaluation volunteer must attend lab CEPE achieve follow : blood collection , carry fast , always morning , body composition assessment , perform later collect blood , repeat maximum test - 1RM - group perform exercise resistance , actigraphy sleep diary ( 15 day ) ; polysomnographic study questionnaire . In program resistive exercise hold 48 session involve upper low limb , abdominal paraspinal region . There 4 exercise upper limb : biceps , triceps , back chest ; 4 low limb : flexor , extensor , abductor adductor , exercise trunk flexion region abdomen extension paravertebral trunk . It initially use relative intensity 50 % 1-RM . After 2 month train intensity increase 60 % 1-RM . Each exercise conduct three set 12 repetition , interval 30 second set one minute exercise . The total duration training session approximately 50 minute . Before start training , participant hold 5 minute stretch warm bicycle ergometer ( Life Cycle 9100 ) treadmill ( Life Fitness 9100 ) period . After session , volunteer perform repeated stretch start training . The group submit follow practice stretch protocol perform Tworoger et al . consist 48 session stretch 60 minute low intensity , three time week . The session begin 5 minute walk around room , follow 45 minute stretch exercise involve upper low limb , 8 10 type region end 10 minute relaxation .</detailed_description>
