	<brief_summary>Hemophilia A genetic deficiency factor VIII cause blood clot slowly . The disease classify base much factor VIII blood . People mild moderate hemophilia A low , detectable , blood level factor VIII bleed trauma surgery . At time surgery , need receive factor VIII replacement infusion vein blood clot normally abnormal bleeding avoid . A complication hemophilia A development antibody bind factor VIII make factor VIII infuse treatment work properly . This antibody call inhibitor . In mild moderate hemophilia A , inhibitor common , report occur intensive factor VIII infusion , may occur time surgery . This study design observe people mild moderate hemophilia A surgery . Information surgery , treatment give , bleed , infection gather . Also , blood drawn determine immune system react factor VIII . No specific treatment give part study . We use information determine influence inhibitor development . A good understanding inhibitor development help medical provider thing avoid inhibitor development population researcher design new treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhibitor Development Patients With Hemophilia A Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development neutralize anti-factor VIII ( fVIII ) antibody , fVIII inhibitor , significant complication affect patient hemophilia A ( HA ) . Once inhibitor develops , treatment less effective costly . Although inhibitor occur commonly severe HA , 25 % new inhibitor occur non-severe HA . In patient non-severe HA , development fVIII inhibitor change course disease one easily manage one potential spontaneous life-threatening difficult treat bleed . Although significant advance make understanding risk factor fVIII inhibitor development patient severe HA , study seek understand risk fVIII inhibitor development non-severe disease limit retrospective analysis . In retrospective analysis , intensive fVIII treatment surgery identify risk factor fVIII inhibitor development non-severe HA . Additionally , receive fVIII continuous infusion associate fVIII inhibitor development non-severe HA study may due part robust proinflammatory response continuous infusion . Accordingly , next logical step evaluate risk inhibitor development associate continuous fVIII infusion prospective observational cohort study . Additionally , knowledge immune response fVIII surgical set essential identification patient high risk inhibitor development development strategy prevent inhibitor development best evaluate set prospective cohort study . This multicenter prospective observational cohort study enroll total 140 subject 10 center mild moderate hemophilia ( fVIII activity 1-40 % ) schedule undergo surgery least 5 consecutive day fVIII replacement therapy require . The study gather clinical data collect blood specimen 4 occasion 3 month period . Outcomes include : inhibitor development , total fVIII usage , bleeding , marker T cell activation .</detailed_description>
