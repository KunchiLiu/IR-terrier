	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational new drug call carfilzomib , combination dexamethasone subject newly diagnose multiple myeloma follow treatment combination drug clarithromycin ( Biaxin® ) , lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) dexamethasone ( Decadron® ) [ BiRD ] lenalidomide alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Clarithromycin ( Biaxin® ) , Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) , Dexamethasone ( Decadron® ) Car-BiRD Therapy Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While new anti-myeloma therapy bortezomib immunomodulatory drug develop , multiple myeloma remain incurable malignancy . Given obtain complete remission ( CR ) therapy allow patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma enjoy high quality life long duration freedom disease symptom , find optimally effective well-tolerated regimen imperative . The robust overall response rate 91 % BiRD regimen patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma encourage believe add carfilzomib overall response rate CR rate improve . As carfilzomib proven efficacy myeloma patient 's relapsed bortezomib , anticipate synergize previous BiRD regimen induce great reduction tumor burden overall . The primary endpoint include best response rate , toxicity , progression free survival , event free survival , overall survival . In patient eligible autologous stem cell transplantation , also study effect carfilzomib CD 34+ stem cell yield follow mobilization .</detailed_description>
