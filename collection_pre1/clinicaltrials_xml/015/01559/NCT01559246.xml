	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare short term ( 48 hour ) traditional cardiac rhythm monitoring use standard ambulatory Holter monitor versus long term ( 14 day ) , continuous ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitor use new device clear FDA ( Zio® Patch ) , iRhythm Technologies , Inc. , San Francisco CA ) patient suspect cardiac arrhythmia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>True Continuous ECG Monitoring ( TCEM Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational study patient see Holter lab Scripps Green Hospital Scripps Clinic location . Only patient indication traditional cardiac rhythm monitoring enrol study . Patients 18 year older suspect arrhythmia capable provide informed consent wear traditional Holter monitor 48 hour Zio® Patch 14 day . Both device initiate time interfere one another . This also allow direct comparison initial 24 hour monitoring period two device . As Zio® Patch wear 14 day instead 24 hour , assess physician 's opinion ( refer physician ) , wait extended time hinders able provide medical care and/or diagnosis patient .</detailed_description>
