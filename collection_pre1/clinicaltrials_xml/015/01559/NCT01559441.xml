	<brief_summary>Increased postprandial lipemia may increase risk cardiovascular disease . An important mechanistic link lipemia follow high-fat meal adverse cardiovascular event lipid-mediated endothelial activation . Therefore , important identify nutrient neutralize acute vascular disturbance . The investigator hypothesize beetroot juice , food rich inorganic nitrate , could improve vascular activity postprandial phase .</brief_summary>
