	<brief_summary>Clostridium difficile bacteria cause significant diarrheal disease , particularly people take potent antibiotic . When C. difficile multiplies within colon , produce two toxin cause inflammation resultant abdominal pain , fever diarrhea . Current treatment mild moderate disease immediate release metronidazole , antibiotic kill C. difficile . Dr. Reddy 's Laboratories develop delayed release form metronidazole release colon increase concentration antibiotic colon improve effectiveness metronidazole treatment potentially allow less whole body exposure antibiotic . This study measure amount metronidazole blood stool patient C. difficile associate diarrhea ( CDAD ) confirm new formulation release antibiotic design , immediately colon .</brief_summary>
