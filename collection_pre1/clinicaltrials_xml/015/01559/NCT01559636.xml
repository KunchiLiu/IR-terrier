	<brief_summary>Global eradication poliomyelitis proven elusive . Although 99 % case eliminate since 1988 , outbreak continue occur , new tool need accelerate eradication . One concern effort population decrease immunogenicity oral poliovirus vaccine ( OPV ) . Past study show decreased seroimmunity trivalent OPV ( tOPV ) child diarrhea . In 2009 , bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) recommend use immunization campaign , likely replace tOPV routine immunization 2016 . However , effect diarrhea seroconversion bOPV study . This project evaluate effect diarrhea seroconversion bOPV among infant reside Nepal . The investigator conduct prospective , interventional study assess immune response bOPV among infant without diarrhea . Immune response compare among infant without diarrhea . This study result well understanding factor decrease ability child seroconvert OPV protect poliomyelitis infection .</brief_summary>
