	<brief_title>Buprenorphine Methadone Opioid-dependent Chronic Back Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic non-malignant pain ( i.e . pain unrelated cancer persist beyond usual course disease injury ) major concern United States . Opioids commonly prescribe medication treat patient chronic non-malignant pain . However , one systematic review chronic low back pain , author note , although clinical trial suggest opioids effective short-term use ( â‰¤ 16 week ) , effectiveness long-term opioids ( &gt; 16 week ) pain relief improved physical functioning less clear . Five 31 percent chronic back pain patient prescribe long-term opioids show aberrant drug-taking behavior . Many develop tolerance withdrawal , 43 % patient exhibit opioid addiction . Therefore , patient chronic pain co-occurring opioid addiction present clinical challenge . In case , referral addiction expert recommend , specialized treatment currently base expert opinion observational study . The expert recommendation detoxification follow treatment methadone , buprenorphine , naltrexone , non-opioid analgesic conjunction behavioral counseling . Discontinuing short-acting opioid medication increase pain make difficult patient abstain opioids due severity pain . However , continue opioid medication worsen addiction render opioids ineffective treatment pain . Research need compare various medication-assisted treatment . Long-acting opioids ( e.g. , methadone , buprenorphine ) use replace treatment short-acting opioids ( e.g. , hydrocodone , oxycodone ) . Methadone full mu-opioid-receptor agonist effective treating pain . Two small study suggest treatment patient chronic pain co-occurring substance use disorder methadone adjunctive pain management therapy superior non-opioid treatment protocol . Despite demonstration methadone effective analgesic opioid addiction treatment , possess side effect ( e.g , constipation ) serious adverse event ( e.g , respiratory depression , risk overdose ) limit use , make physician reluctant prescribe methadone . Buprenorphine , partial opioid agonist , alternative methadone treatment opioid addiction , safety profile superior methadone , possess analgesic property . For outpatient use , buprenorphine combine naloxone ( BUP/NLX ) reduce potential abuse ( i.e. , IV administration ) . When give abuse prescription opioids BUP/NLX possess well treatment outcome abuse heroin . In one uncontrolled case series 95 participant , Malinoff colleague conclude effectiveness treatment opioid dependence , provide analgesia , low abuse liability make BUP/NLX potentially useful treatment patient chronic pain co-occurring opioid addiction . In randomized controlled trial Blondell et al . ( 2010 ) , treatment BUP/NLX superior abstinence-oriented approach regard treatment retention patient chronic pain co-existent opioid addiction . However , randomize clinical trial compare BUP/NLX methadone maintenance chronic pain patient opioid addiction . Preliminary data suggest 6-months BUP/NLX methadone treatment result analgesia , methadone treatment result good addiction outcome . The present study design determine complexity recovery outcomes ( e.g. , function , mental health ) chronic pain patient . Clinicians need evidence-based guideline effectively manage patient chronic pain evidence opioid misuse addiction behavior . In study , plan investigate whether patient treat BUP/NLX usual care improve clinical outcome provide methadone treatment usual care . Specifically , propose give 63 patient BUP/NLX therapy 6 month ( experimental group ) 63 patient methadone therapy 6 ( active comparator ) . We hypothesize patient give BUP/NLX treatment similar outcome receive methadone maintenance respect functioning , mental health , pain level , treatment retention .</detailed_description>
