	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect low dose versus high dose steroid vital sign patient currently steroid recently treat steroid undergo major colorectal surgery . The investigator hypothesize statistically significant difference orthostatic hypotension ( blood pressure measure lying , sit , stand ) , blood pressure , temperature heart rate standard low dose group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Low Dose High Dose Steroids Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary aim study perioperative hemodynamic profile patient chronic steroid undergo colon rectal surgery . We measure heart rate , temperature blood pressure operate room postoperative hospitalization . Patients identify preoperative visit . They randomize high dose low dose steroid study group . The standard dose steroid patient receive hydrocortisone 100 mg IV preoperatively 100 mg IV every 8 hrs standard taper . The low dose steroid study group receive IV equivalent preoperative steroid dose postoperative period . The patient blood pressure , temperature heart rate monitor operating room ward postoperatively . Outcomes compare two group . We hypothesize statistically significant difference blood pressure , temperature heart rate high dose low dose group . The secondary aim study monitoring difference surgical outcome , include postoperative length stay , two patient group .</detailed_description>
