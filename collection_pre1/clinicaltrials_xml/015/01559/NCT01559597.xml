	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness , safety feasibility tetanus toxoid ( TT ) vaccination strategy rely maintenance vaccine control temperature chain ( CTC ) . The CTC define storage transport vaccine within temperature range appropriate heat stability profile TT vaccine . In study vaccine transport stored cold chain district level . From district beneficiary level vaccine expose ambient temperature limited period time . In initial phase , stability 3 lot TT vaccine keep CTC determine . For , potency , safety , pH adsorption vaccine maintain CTC test laboratory compare vaccine maintain cold chain . If parameter ( i.e . potency , safety , pH adsorption ) WHO specifications strategy CTC use . Only laboratory result adequate , village assign one vaccination strategy . All woman 14 49 year age select village fulfill inclusion criterion invite participate . In order determine baseline anti-tetanus protection , TT vaccination history collect participant use standardized questionnaire . Women already receive least 2 dos TT vaccine exclude study . Moreover , blood collect participant later verify laboratory baseline protection . A first dose TT vaccine give accord assign strategy ( CTC cold chain ) . Four week 1st vaccination , second TT vaccine give use strategy employ first dose . Finally , four week second dose , blood sample collect participant receive two dos vaccine . The serological response compare group receive two dos TT vaccine maintain cold chain ant group receive two dos vaccine maintain CTC .</brief_summary>
