	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize clinical trial examine usefulness addition pelvic compression belt lumbopelvic stabilization program patient sacroiliac joint pain compare lumbopelvic stabilization exercise pelvic compression belt lumbopelvic stabilization exercise alone . Outcome measure include Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index ( OSW ) , percentage change TrA IO muscle thickness ( i.e . muscle contraction rest contract ) utilize ultrasound imaging , Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) pain , subjective rating overall perceive improvement use Global Rating Change ( GROC ) scale collect . Hypothesis : The OSW score NPRS score lower receive compression belt addition lumbopelvic stabilization program compare receive lumbopelvic stabilization alone . The percent change muscle thickness deep abdominal well GROC score high receive compression belt addition lumbopelvic stabilization program compare receive lumbopelvic stabilization alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Compression Belt Patients With Sacroiliac Joint Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The estimate prevalence sacroiliac joint ( SIJ ) pain approximately 13-30 % patient non-specific low back pain . One common presentation SIJ pain unilateral pain SIJ region , describe positive Fortin 's sign . Common impairment population include pelvic asymmetry , lumbopelvic muscle imbalance , decrease lumbopelvic proprioceptive awareness stability . Two common physical therapy intervention population lumbopelvic stabilization program pelvic compression belt . The purpose randomized clinical trial examine usefulness addition pelvic compression belt lumbopelvic stabilization program patient sacroiliac joint pain compare lumbopelvic stabilization exercise pelvic compression belt lumbopelvic stabilization exercise alone . Participants : Thirty participant unilateral pain near SIJ recruit study randomly assign 1 2 treatment group ( stabilization plus belt stabilization alone ) . Both group receive lumbopelvic stabilization program 12 week . The stabilization plus belt group also receive pelvic compression belt worn continuously first 4 week . Outcome measure include Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index ( OSW ) , percentage change TrA IO muscle thickness ( i.e . muscle contraction rest contract ) utilize ultrasound imaging , Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) pain , subjective rating overall perceive improvement use Global Rating Change ( GROC ) scale collect . These outcome assess baseline , 4 week , 3 month post-intervention . Hypothesis : The OSW score NPRS score lower receive compression belt addition lumbopelvic stabilization program compare receive lumbopelvic stabilization alone . The percent change muscle thickness deep abdominal well GROC score high receive compression belt addition lumbopelvic stabilization program compare receive lumbopelvic stabilization alone . Data Analysis : Two separate ANOVAs ( group x time ) repeat measure use examine effect intervention disability percent change muscle thickness . Whitney U-test use analyze NPRS data , descriptive statistic use report GROC score . Clinical Relevance : The result study may provide evidence prescribe pelvic compression belt SIJ pain . It also offer guidance pelvic compression belt use population . Finally , guide physical therapist prescribe effective intervention SIJ pain .</detailed_description>
