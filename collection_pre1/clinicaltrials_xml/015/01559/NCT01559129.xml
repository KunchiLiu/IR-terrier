	<brief_title>Study Pomalidomide ( CC-4047 ) Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics Effectiveness Subjects With Systemic Sclerosis With Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based upon interim analysis data Phase 2 proof concept study subject systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease ( CC-4047-SSC-001 ) , study meet primary endpoint improvement Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) improvement modify Rodnan skin score 24 52 week , subject complete blinded treatment . In study , pomalidomide well tolerated adverse event profile comparable risk safety information know pomalidomide disease . Treatment stop , patient remain follow .</detailed_description>
