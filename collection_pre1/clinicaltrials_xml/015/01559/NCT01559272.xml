	<brief_title>A Study Assess Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability Paliperidone Palmitate Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , parallel-group ( group patient initiate simultaneously ) study 4 panel ( A , B , C D ) . Each panel comprise 2 single-dose treatment period . In Period 1 , patient 4 panel receive intramuscular ( i.m . ) injection 1 mg paliperidone immediate release ( IR ) solution assess tolerability allergic hypersensitivity reaction potentially related paliperidone , establish relative bioavailability ( extent drug substance become available body ) paliperidone palmitate versus paliperidone IR . Patients Panels A C receive i.m . injection 1 mg paliperidone IR solution gluteal muscle , patient Panel B D receive i.m . injection 1 mg paliperidone IR solution deltoid gluteal muscle . Patients tolerate injection complete assessment Day 5 Period 1 enrol Period 2 . In Period 2 , patient receive single dose 3-month paliperidone palmitate i.m . injection dosage define panel . The study drug injection follow 96-hour observation period Period 1 , 364-day 544-day observation period Period 2 . Successive study drug administration separate washout period ( period receive treatment ) least 7 21 day . The total study length patient 53 week maximum 58 week . Patients Panel B , consent , Panel D participate extension period approximately 26 week order obtain additional assessment able characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile . Pharmacokinetics explore drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time . Therefore , participate extension period , total study duration approximately 84 week .</detailed_description>
