	<brief_summary>The objective study two-fold : 1 . To determine mean 5 year patency rate radial artery graft ( Open vs. Endoscopic ) patient already CABG surgery previously participate centre 's RCT back 2005-2007 use CTA MPS-MIBI 2 . To determine patient quality life 5 year post CABG surgery It hypothesize mean 5 year patency rate radial artery graft harvest endoscopically equal great patency radial artery graft harvest via conventional/open technique . It hypothesize patient quality life similar amongst patient open vs. endoscopic radial artery graft CABG surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Follow-up Open Versus Endoscopic Radial Artery Harvest With CT Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After patient consent REB approval The University Western Ontario ( REB # 11054 ) conduct Randomized Controlled Trial 2005-2007 endoscopic vs. conventional harvest radial artery CABG patient London Health Sciences Centre . A total 118 patient randomize either A ) conventional/open harvest radial artery , n=59 B ) endoscopic harvest radial artery , n=59 . Post-operative study objective measure arm wound infection rate , assessment arm pain , arm edema , mobilization , patient satisfaction , histological assessment radial artery . Objectives measure patient ' course in-hospital 1week telephone interview . At 6 week patient underwent final clinic assessment post-surgery . Our intent perform follow-up angiography MPS-MIBI 5 year mark post surgery 118 patient previously involve RCT , ass open vs. endoscopic radial artery graft performance . The study divide three phase : Phase I - Patient Recruitment ( 4 month ) , Phase II - Patient Assessment CTA , MPS-MIBI Questionnaires ( 16 month ) Phase III - Data Analysis Conclusions ( 4 month ) . Phase I - Chart Review Patient Recruitment ( 4 Months ) Charts review open endoscopically harvest radial artery graft use CABG surgery specify time point . Patient demographic operative note , well perioperative postoperative complication review . Hospital admission , document cardiac event subsequent death previously document record . Any additional pertinent data chart review enter study specific Microsoft Excel file maintain single qualified research assistant . All live CABG surgery patient contact participation study request . Patients receive initial request mail , informative letter sign principal investigator outline purpose study , participation study involve , specific aim cardiac team conclusion study . A follow-up phone call do within 3-weeks mailing letter go content answer question patient may . Phase II - Patient Assessment via CTA , MPS-MIBI Questionnaires ( 16 Months ) CABG surgery patient previous RCT agree part study arrangement make travel LHSC . Patients undergo structured half-day ( approximately 4-6 hour ) hospital consist following : 1 . Selective coronary artery radial artery graft check via CTA 64 slice CT scanner + Rest MPS-MIBI Stress MPS-MIBI ( 4-6hrs ) . The CT scanner along stress/rest MIBI machine dedicate `` Research '' machine . As , issue use research dedicate machine additional cost OHIP . 2 . Completion two validate health relate quality life questionnaires 1 . Seattle Angina Questionnaire 2 . 36-Item Short Form Health Survey SELECTIVE CORONARY ARTERY &amp; RADIAL ARTERY GRAFT CHECK VIA CTA AND REST &amp; STRESS MPS-MIBI Coronary CTA Rest Stress MPS-MIBI use evaluate radial artery graft patency . Potential risk associate CTA MPS-MIBI test discuss patient prior perform procedure . This discussion include follow : As CTA x-ray test , send radiation body . Although amount radiation scan small , accumulate damage body cell time repeat exposure . Contrast material carry slight risk cause allergic reaction contrast material dye . During Rest Stress MPS-MIBI , radioactive tracer ( MIBI ) use take picture heart . This tracer inject bloodstream travel heart muscle coronary artery . Pictures take heart determine coronary artery disease perfusion image rest stress help identify region myocardial infarction well help determine hemodynamic significance coronary stenosis . MPS also give estimate leave ventricular ejection fraction . Signed consent obtain prior procedure . Contrast inject coronary artery vein graft CTA MPS-MIBI image obtain . EVALUATING RADIAL ARTERY GRAFT PATENCY All coronary artery radial artery graft CTAs MPS-MIBIs perform graded Nuclear Medicine physician . Following patency determination , patient contact Dr.Bob Kiaii ( cardiac surgeon ) tell result . Radial artery graft patency determine use grade system Fitzgibbons associate : Grade A Excellent graft unimpaired run-off , patent graft Grade B Stenosis reduce caliber proximal , distal anastomosis trunk &lt; 50 % graft coronary artery . This divide flow limit non-flow limit stenosis Grade O Occlusion QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES To assess quality life 5 year undergo CABG surgery participate RCT , patient self-administer two validate health-related quality life questionnaires site LHSC . The two questionnaire use Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) 36-Item Short Form Health Survey . Licensing user registration permit use questionnaire obtain online Cardiovascular Outcomes Inc. ( SAQ ) Quality Metric ( SF-36 ) prior distribution use . SEATTLE ANGINA QUESTIONNAIRE The SAQ 19-item , well standardize self-administered questionnaire show valid measure quality life patient suffer coronary artery disease . The disease-specific questionnaire measure five clinically important dimension health coronary artery disease patient : physical limitation , angina stability , angina frequency , treatment satisfaction disease perception . The SAQ show sensitive clinical change coronary artery disease comparison generic quality life questionnaire . 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY The SF-36 36-item , generic quality life questionnaire measure patient 's general health status . Also well-standardized self-administered , SF-36 measure eight health concept : physical conditioning , role limitation due physical problem , social functioning , bodily pain , general mental health , role limitation due emotional problem , vitality general health perception . It also include indication perceive change health . The questionnaire proven relevant across age , disease process treatment group . Using disease-specific questionnaire general health questionnaire combination aptly categorize overall impact CABG surgery patient quality life . The effect CABG surgery regard cardiovascular function well outside system well understood .</detailed_description>
