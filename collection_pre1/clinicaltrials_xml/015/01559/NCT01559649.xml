	<brief_title>Stroke Swallowing Screening Tool Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early detection aspiration risk acute stroke critical allows immediate intervention , thereby reduce mortality , morbidity , length hospitalization , healthcare cost . Screening swallow prior administration food , liquid medication , include aspirin , individual present stroke symptom guideline American Heart Association/American Stroke Association . In accordance guideline , Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) advocate screen swallow quality performance measure acute stroke . Moreover , Office Inspector General recently issue VHA Directive 2006-032 mandate initial nurse assessment must include screen swallow . In response directive , many VHA facility create implemented version nursing swallow screen tool ( SST ) , knowledge , none validate use instrumental swallow examination reliability establish . In develop establish valid reproducible SST patient stroke , clinician divide need include trial water swallow part SST . The current notion administer trial swallow discipline without expertise dysphagia would compromise patient safety , thus step oppose many speech pathologist nurse . The prudency introduce non-validated , non-reproducible SSTs questionable . The primary objective study construct reliable valid SST identify risk aspiration individual admit suspected stroke . The specific aim proposal : 1 ) determine nurse make reliable inter-rater judgment swallow non-swallowing feature historically use speech pathologist make judgment aspiration , 2 ) identify combination item provide high level sensitivity specificity identification aspiration risk measure videofluoroscopic swallow study ( VFSS ) individual admit suspect stroke . Outcomes research inform execution multi-site feasibility study implementation reliable valid SST nurse Methods : Consecutive individual admit suspected stroke ( N = 270 ) recruit participate . Individuals undergo screen swallow VFSS . Screening item select validation identification risk aspiration patient present stroke symptom base extensive literature review use Cochrane QUADAS guideline . Eight screen item test validity inter-rater reliability : 6 non-swallowing feature 2 swallow feature . Reliability nursing observation screen item complete participant . Speech pathologist serve reference standard compare reliability register nurse routinely work hospital ward stroke patient .</detailed_description>
