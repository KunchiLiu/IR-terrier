Similar dependence heavy drug , alcohol cannabis-dependent patient find difficult quit drink smoke cannabis relapse drink alcohol use cannabis treatment . Craving alcohol cannabis withdrawal detoxification major factor relapse drink use cannabis . The cue-exposure priming paradigm use order induce crave alcohol cannabis laboratory . Several study delineate brain mechanism responsible cue-induced craving alcohol use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , method useful monitoring progress treatment .

We also propose use establish technique prim cue-exposure alcoholic drink cannabis together measure [ 18F ] Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image 24 alcohol cannabis-dependent patient 35 day treatment naltrexone . We predict successful quitting alcohol drink use cannabis would reduction alcohol cannabis cue-induced brain activity meso-limbic reward circuit responsible crave alcohol cannabis .</detailed_description>
