	<brief_title>Therapeutic Evaluation Steroids IgA Nephropathy Global Study ( TESTING Low Dose Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IgA glomerulonephritis common primary glomerulonephritis , immunosuppression steroid suggest potential protective therapy , although benefit risk clearly establish . The TESTING study establish compare effect oral methylprednisolone 0.8 mg/kg/day wean 6-8 month , match placebo risk kidney failure event , use double-blind , randomise , control design . After randomisation 262 participant TESTING imbalance serious adverse event note methylprednisolone placebo arm trial Data Monitoring Committee , mostly due infection . As data also suggest likely benefit kidney outcome , 240 participant randomise methylprednisolone 0.4 mg/kg/day compare match placebo ( The TESTING low-dose group ) . Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim also provide reduce risk infection All participant undergo long term follow-up least 160 primary outcome event observe ( expect average least 4 year ) , effect steroids risk composite kidney outcome assess study population whole , stratify treatment regimen long evidence significant heterogeneity efficacy reduce primary outcome . Each original low-dose cohort TESTING also separate power detect reduction proteinuria effect average eGFR , along effect important safety outcome steroid regimen use .</detailed_description>
