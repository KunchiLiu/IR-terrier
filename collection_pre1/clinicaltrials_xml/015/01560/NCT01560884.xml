	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Phosphate Binding Capacity Renazorb</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , dose-ranging study healthy volunteer . Four sequential dose cohort 8 subject plan . Six subject randomly assign receive SPI-014 2 subject receive placebo within cohort . The dos SPI-014 1500 mg/day ( Group A ) , 3000 mg/day ( Group B ) , 4500 mg/day ( Group C ) 6000 mg/day ( Group D ) , take orally 3 time day within 15 min meal . Following screening period evaluation eligibility criterion , subject admit clinical research unit . From Day 1 Day 10 subject place controlled phosphate diet ( approve qualified dietician ) . From Day 1 Day 5 ( day ) , 24 hour urine feces collect void pool separate container baseline phosphorus content . On Days 6 10 , subject receive SPI-014 placebo within 15 minute 3 main meal ( see table ) . From morning Day 8 morning Day 13 , 24 hour urine feces collect day determine phosphorus content . Subjects discharge Day 13 return 7 day later End-of-Study Visit Day 20 . Starting dose 1500 mg/day . All safety data , include laboratory test adverse event , review prior escalation next cohort . After completion first cohort , grade 3 AEs ( vomit nausea ) observe first cohort Day 20 , Confidential 24 treatment second cohort begin . Similarly , third fourth cohort follow completion second third cohort respectively . Subjects admit clinical research unit Day -1 remain clinical research unit Day 13 . From Day 1 Day 10 , subject consume phosphate-controlled diet design provide 37.5 mmol ( 1200 mg ) elemental phosphorus per day ( 3 meal 1 snack ) . The mean phosphorus content meal 12.1 mmol ( 387 mg ) , 8.6 mmol ( 275 mg ) , 12.0 mmol ( 416 mg ) , 2.6 mmol ( 83 mg ) breakfast , lunch , dinner , snack , respectively . With breakfast , majority phosphorus administer milk . With meal phosphorus primarily administer solid food . During 10-day treatment period subject require ingest meal entirety . The primary endpoint phosphate binding capacity SPI-014 judged level phosphorus feces urine . Phosphate excretion urine expect go fecal excretion expect go treatment SPI-014 . Safety assessment periodic physical examination vital sign measurement , safety laboratory test , ECGs , AEs , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) .</detailed_description>
