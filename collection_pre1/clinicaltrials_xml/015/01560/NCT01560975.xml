	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea characterize repetitive episode decrease interrupted airflow upper airway sleep . Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common sleep-related breathing disorder characterize repeat partial complete upper airway collapse , gasp episode , daytime sleepiness fatigue . Once suspect , diagnosis make basis anamnesis polysomnography ( PSG ) use so-called respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) grade OSAS . Standard therapy consist continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) sleep prevent upper airway collapse . The association OSAS glaucoma extensively study , although report non-confirmatory . OSAS associate reduced ocular blood flow , lead hypoxia hypercapnia , , may represent risk factor glaucomatous optic neuropathy . OSAS also related loss nycthemeral rhythm intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . In addition , CPAP report increase IOP use nighttime . The purpose study investigate IOP varies time , particularly sleep OSAS patient without glaucoma , IOP variation associate use CPAP . IOP fluctuation monitor SENSIMED Triggerfish® , portable investigational device use contact lens sensor monitor IOP fluctuation continuously 24-hours .</brief_summary>
