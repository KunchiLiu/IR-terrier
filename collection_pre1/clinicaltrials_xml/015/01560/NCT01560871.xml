	<brief_summary>Patients chronic heart failure need `` safe effective '' exercise program improve quality life . For study , determine adult chronic heart failure patent assign experimental exercise group walk Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) program additional beneficial effect respiratory muscle strength ( PImax ) , cardiovascular endurance , quality life , walk speed , heart rate variability , physical activity level compare subject assign home walking `` sham '' Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Walking Program Inspiratory Muscle Training Individuals With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit outpatient heart failure transitional care clinic Presbyterian Hospital Dallas local heart failure support group . Flyers distribute cardiologist , nurse practitioner , research nurse , local heart failure support group Dallas/Ft Worth area . Cardiologists nurse practitioner aware scope study inclusion exclusion criterion research participant . Potential research participant could call research team information . Participants come facility first initial evaluation session history interview conduct gather demographic data age , gender , height , weight , race/ethnicity past medical/surgical history . The following baseline data collect : ) two trial 6 minute walk test , b ) respiratory muscle strength ( PImax ) , c ) comfortable walk speed , ) hand grip strength , e ) single limb stance time . During testing , heart rate heart rhythms continuously record via holter monitor . During rest break , research participant fill two quality life questionnaire ( SF-36 , Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ) . After rest break , participant repeat six-minute walk test . Each participant randomly assign one two group : ) walk program high-intensity Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) program , OR walk program sham IMT program . The Sham group train low intensity . The training threshold Experimental IMT group set 60 % PImax adjust weekly follow . The frequency training : 5x/week ( 1x/day prefer ) 6 Interval Levels session ( 6 inspiratory effort level ) : ( 1 ) 60 rest interval ; ( 2 ) 45s rest interval ; ( 3 ) 30 rest interval ; ( 4 ) 15 rest interval ; ( 5 ) 10 rest interval ; ( 6 ) 5 rest interval , trained exhaustion . The sham IMT intensity set fix 15 % PImax . Research participant blind group assign . The time commitment IMT training 15-20 minute per training session home . Weekly follow maximal inspiratory pressure ( PIMax ) do School Physical Therapy Dallas , train new IMT training intensity breathe device 15-20 minute . Researchers also make copy weekly step count log . Each participant give breathe device breathe exercise . Each participant also give pedometer , accelerometer , heart rate monitor track daily step count heart rate . The walk program consist walk every day intensity `` hard '' `` somewhat hard '' Rating Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) scale . Participants instruct walk 15 minute twice day initially , progress 45-50 minute day end six week . At end 6 week , participant return facility 2-hour final evaluation .</detailed_description>
