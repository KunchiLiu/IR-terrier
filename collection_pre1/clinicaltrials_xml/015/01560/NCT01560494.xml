	<brief_title>Validation Curriculum ( STAC ) Technical Skill Acquisition Minimally Invasive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study develop validate ex-vivo comprehensive curriculum basic laparoscopic procedure . Although simulator well validated tool teach technical skill , integration comprehensive curriculum lacking . Moreover , neither effect ex-vivo training learn curve operate room ( OR ) , effect non-technical proficiency investigate . This randomized single-blinded prospective trial allocate 20 surgical trainee structured-curriculum ( STAC ) group conventional residency training . The STAC curriculum consist : case-based learning , proficiency-based virtual reality training , laparoscopic box training , OR participation . After completion intervention , participant perform 5 sequential laparoscopic cholecystectomy OR . The primary outcome measure difference technical performance 2 group first laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Secondary outcome measure include difference respect : learning curve OR , technical proficiency sequential laparoscopic cholecystectomy , non-technical skill .</detailed_description>
