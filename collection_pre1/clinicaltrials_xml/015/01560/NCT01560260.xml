	<brief_title>Linsitinib Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate treatment OSI-906 ( linsitinib ) 150mg BIO patient advance wild-type ( WT ) gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical benefit rate ( stable disease [ SD ] &gt; = 9 month , partial response [ PR ] , complete response [ CR ] ) patient advance WT GIST treat OSI-906 . II . To determine response duration , progression free survival , overall survival patient advance WT GIST treat OSI-906 . III . To determine tolerability adverse event profile OSI-906 patient advanced GIST . IV . To explore pattern protein expression serum tumor tissue predictor response progression-free survival ( PFS ) advance WT GIST treat OSI-906 . V. To evaluate metabolic response OSI-906 use fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) . VI . To determine tumor metabolic response correlate anatomic response clinical benefit . VII . To measure change tumor metabolism FDG-PET qualitatively semi-quantitatively standard uptake value ( SUV ) tumor body ratio ( TBR ) baseline first compute tomography ( CT ) -response evaluation correlate finding size change define conventional cross-sectional imaging scan . VIII . To investigate correlation glucose , insulin , candidate tumor tissue blood biomarkers FDG-PET metabolic response . OUTLINE : Patients receive linsitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 12 week 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
