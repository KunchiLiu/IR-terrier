	<brief_summary>Corneal disease major cause blindness worldwide , corneal infection substantial cause blindness Asia . The aim Asia Cornea Society Infectious Keratitis Study ( ACSIKS ) study infectious keratitis ( corneal infection ) Asian country , improve strategy prevention treatment , reduce burden blindness Asia . The first phase ACSIKS 18-month observational study involve 11 eye hospital 8 Asian country ; hospital manage 6700 case corneal infection every year . From first quarter 2012 , patient corneal infection recruit standard ACSIKS protocol apply ; protocol include use common set study form suggest panel microbiological examination . However , centre continue treat patient anti-infective therapy standard centre . Data record patient period six month , include medical surgical management , final clinical outcome vision . Bacterial fungal growth patient also store research second phase ACSIKS . These study focus evaluate resistance common bacterial infection current available antibiotic , perform DNA test compare strain bacterial infection West , develop new diagnostic test anti-infective therapy tailor corneal infection Asia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary ACSIKS Clinical Protocol : All patient initial clinical diagnosis infectious keratitis refer attend ophthalmologist-in-charge ACSIKS co-investigator trial coordinator recruitment study . Patients enrol study study inform consent obtain trained interviewer administer standardize ACSIKS Clinical Case Report Form recruit subject . Information document would include demographic profile ( e.g . age , gender , ethnic group , occupation , etc ) , risk factor infectious keratitis , present symptom prior treatment . Patients contact lens wearer also complete separate contact lens questionnaire , specific question duration contact lens wear , type contact lens solution use , lens wear schedule habit , adherence lens care practice . All patient undergo thorough ocular examination ophthalmologist-in-charge ACSIKS co-investigator , detail infectious keratitis associate finding document ACSIKS Clinical CRF . With approval ophthalmologist-in-charge , corneal scraping collect per ACSIKS Microbiological Protocol . Each study subject consequently still manage ophthalmologist-in-charge accord his/her current clinical approach , appropriate medical surgical treatment carry accordance practice pattern standard his/her institution , attempt deviate current treatment practice . Regular chart review perform ACSIKS trial coordinator six month duration subject ' involvement document initial differential diagnosis medical treatment , microbiological result , change diagnosis treatment . The last consultation ophthalmologist-in-charge six month-period take final study review . Summary ACSIKS Microbiological Protocol : At discretion ophthalmologist-in-charge , corneal scraping collect base list investigation suggest ACSIKS Group . All microbiological specimen incubate , interpret report accord agree upon common standard , regardless number colony present . Bacterial organism also test use standardized antibiograms agree upon microbiologist various participate institution . Results microbiological testing collect record ACSIKS Microbiological Case Report Form . If samples yield positive growth either fungal bacterial organism ( ) , causative organism culture sub-cultured stored site 's ACSIKS freezer , subsequent transport ACSIKS Central Repository Singapore use future microbial study Phase 2 ACSIKS project .</detailed_description>
