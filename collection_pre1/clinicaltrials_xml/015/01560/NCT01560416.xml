	<brief_summary>Ganetespib drug may stop cancer cell grow . This drug use research study laboratory experiment . It also study phase I trial , appropriate dosing determine . Ganetespib consider `` HSP90 inhibitor '' . By block HSP90 , ganetespib think reduce ability cancer cell become resistant treatment . Fulvestrant hormonal therapy work attach estrogen receptor . In , block effect estrogen cancer cell . In addition , fulvestrant cause decrease number estrogen receptor . Fulvestrant drug approve FDA treatment metastatic , hormone receptor positive breast cancer , base upon result phase III clinical trial . In laboratory , add ganetespib fulvestrant appear improve effectiveness . It know whether true human . In research study , evaluate effect addition ganetespib fulvestrant participant hormone receptor-positive , metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With Without Ganetespib HR+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because one know study option best , `` randomize '' one study group : Arm A : Fulvestrant Arm B : Fulvestrant plus Ganetespib . You one-third chance place Arm A two-thirds chance place Arm B . If initially place Arm A disease progress , option receive combination fulvestrant plus ganetespib part Arm C. You undergo follow procedure research study : study drug ( ) , blood test , clinical exam scans/imaging test .</detailed_description>
