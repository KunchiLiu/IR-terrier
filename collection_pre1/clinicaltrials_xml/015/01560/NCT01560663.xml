This demonstrate poor OS derive chemo-resistant patient ( unfortunately represent &gt; 50 % ) . A relevant problem differential response drug TN tumor . These tumor usually treat multidrug combination include anthracyclines taxanes , pCR´s 28-32 % . Only recently , result small trial combine platinum salt taxanes report , encourage result ( pCR 44-77 % ) . The taxane-platinum salt combination biological background , since TN associate BRCA1 mutation sensitive taxanes resistant anthracyclines platinum salt effective TN tumor probably significant proportion functional DNA repair deficiency . Role anthracyclines taxanes TN breast cancer Efficacy result anthracycline-based regimens patient TNBC remain controversial . The analysis MA5 study ( randomized patient CMF FEC ) , show increase 5-year DFS favor CMF ( 71 % vs 51 % ) basal-like subtype group . The test interaction biologic phenotype treatment arm almost reach significance ( p=0,06 ) indicate patient TNBC may derive particular benefit anthracyclines . Several phase III study compare classical anthracycline schedule anthracycline plus taxane treatment perform retrospective analysis classify patient different breast cancer subtypes . Results analysis show TNBC/BLBC patient treat classic anthracycline regimens poor outcome ( similar study even bad HER2 overexpressing patient trastuzumab era ) . In study TNBC/BLBC population one benefit taxane addition . In addition , single study group compare single agent doxorubicin versus single agent docetaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy locally advance breast cancer . In study , drug similar luminal her2 subtypes , docetaxel significantly superior doxorubicin patient basal-like tumor ( good pathological response rate 56 % vs 0 % , p=0.034 ) . Besides , triple negative status significant predictor resistance doxorubicin multivariate analysis . Residual cancer burden neoadjuvant chemotherapy triple negative tumor also significantly high doxorubicin docetaxel , thus indicate subtype resistant doxorubicin docetaxel . This study firmly suggest docetaxel backbone combination regimens basal-like tumor question role doxorubicin tumor . Role platinum salt TN breast cancer The role platinum salt TNBC currently matter investigation . Basal-like breast cancer ( BLBC ) highly aneuploid , associated BRCA1 germline mutation , loss TP53 , RB1 Chromosome 5q . None characteristic observe Claudin-low tumor suggest different etiology , possibly , different response DNA damage agent . Phase II study suggest platinum salt significant activity en TNBC , particularly BRCA-1 mutation carrier . Unfortunately , distinguish TNBC Claudin-low conventional IHC technique . Activity side effect combination docetaxel-carboplatin breast cancer The combination carboplatin docetaxel extensively study mainly ovarian lung cancer . Doses AUC 5-6 carboplatin combination 75 mg/m2 docetaxel easily combine , myelosuppression important toxicity . This combination study metastatic breast cancer well neoadjuvant setting . Perez et al study docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 IV 1 hour ) follow carboplatin ( AUC 6 IV 30 minute ) first-line chemotherapy 53 woman MBC . Patients receive median 6 cycle . An overall response rate ( ORR ) 60 % ( complete response [ CR ] 6 % , partial response [ PR ] 54 % ) note . Grade 3/4 toxicity include anemia ( 11 % ) , neutropenia ( 94 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 17 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 15 % ) , leukopenia ( 15 % ) , fatigue ( 21 % ) , infection ( 11 % ) , diarrhea ( 11 % ) , hypersensitivity ( 8 % ) , neurosensory ( 4 % ) , neuromotor ( 4 % ) . A total 26 patient receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) and/or erythropoietin support . The author conclude although myelosuppression note , docetaxel carboplatin active treatment regimen first-line therapy MBC prophylactic hematopoietic growth factor support recommend . Docetaxel carboplatin evaluate another phase II study 40 patient previously untreated MBC . Patients receive docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) carboplatin ( AUC 5 ) day 1 every 3 week 6 cycle . An ORR 59 % ( CR 15.4 % , PR 43.6 % ) observe among 39 patient evaluable response . Grade 3/4 toxicity include neutropenia ( n=28 ) , febrile neutropenia ( n=4 ) , thrombocytopenia ( n=4 ) . The author conclude docetaxel carboplatin efficacious first-line treatment metastatic breast cancer , acceptable toxicity profile . An additional phase II study schedule perform , first-line chemotherapy 32 patient ( 30 female , 2 male ) metastatic breast cancer . An ORR 62.07 % ( 8 CRs , 10 PRs ) report ; five patient ( 17.24 % ) progressive disease . Grade 3 toxicity include neutropenia ( 24 % ) , anemia ( 15.6 % ) ; nausea , vomit , fluid retention , peripheral neuropathy occur 15 patient . There report febrile neutropenia , death . The author conclude combination docetaxel carboplatin first-line therapy metastatic breast cancer patient promise well-tolerated toxicity . A fourth trial also schedule determine safety efficacy combination 25 woman MBC . An ORR 56 % ( CR 24 % , PR 32 % ) report . Grade 3/4 toxicity include neutropenia ( 24 % ) , one case febrile neutropenia require hospitalization two patient diarrhea . Anemia note seven patient deem `` mild '' report toxic death . The author conclude combination docetaxel carboplatin safe active first-line therapy patient MBC . With regard use neoadjuvant treatment , combination study 57 patient stage II/III breast cancer ( 10 ) . Docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) give day 1 pegfilgrastim ( 6 mg subcutaneously ) day 2 . This regimen repeat dose-dense manner every 2 week 4 cycle . Fifty-one patient ( 89 % ) breast-conserving surgery within 6 week . Among 57 patient , pathological complete response ( pCR ) 16 % report . Four 9 patient triple negative tumor pCR ( 44 % ) . Thrombocytopenia grade 4 toxicity report . Grade 3 toxicity addition thrombocytopenia consist anemia , fatigue , diarrhea , nausea , hypokalemia . The author conclude combination docetaxel , carboplatin , pegfilgrastim feasible tolerable patient . In phase II trial , Karmarkar et al investigated neoadjuvant regimen four cycle docetaxel ( 90 mg/m2 ) carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) day 1 filgrastim every 3 week 22 patient locally advance breast cancer . After four cycle , patient underwent surgery . A total 16 patient evaluable efficacy toxicity . There five complete response 11 partial response report . Grade 3/4 toxicity include myelosuppression infection ( n=1 ) , myalgia ( n=2 ) , diarrhea ( n=1 ) , fatigue/asthenia ( n=5 ) , nausea ( n=4 ) . The author conclude neoadjuvant combination docetaxel carboplatin active well tolerate ; also note addition filgrastim allow dose intense regimen deliver . A recently publish phase II perform Chang et al studied regimen low docetaxel dose ( 75 mg/m2 ) without G-CSF support . Seventy-three patient treat 4 cycle ( 11 TNBC ) . Patients HER2 positive additionally randomized chemotherapy alone combination trastuzumab weekly . Seventy-one patient underwent surgery 19 ( 26.8 % ) pCR ( absence invasive breast cancer breast ) , 6 within TNBC subgroup . Grade 3/4 toxicity hematological , neutropenia ( 43 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 4 % ) rare . Grade 3 docetaxel hypersensitivity note 4 % patient grade 3/4 adverse event occur less 2 % . All show data , together potential anthracycline cardiotoxicity risk anthracycline-induced leukemia patient high probability cure , challenge role anthracyclines treatment early stage TNBC patient . The combination taxanes platinum salt , therefore , increasingly use neoadjuvant chemotherapy triple negative breast cancer . The docetaxel-carboplatin ( TCb ) regimen active tolerable regimen metastatic locally advanced breast cancer , efficacy toxicity characterization clinical set regain interest era role anthracyclines controversial adjuvant setting . The avoidance potentially serious long-term toxicity specific breast cancer subtypes real challenge attempt individualize therapy . In daily practice , however , problem identify basal-like tumor , since triple negative tumor belong subtype . We need , therefore , predictive marker response neoadjuvant chemotherapy general docetaxel-carboplatin regimen particular . STUDY OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective The primary objective study identify predictor response docetaxel-carboplatin patient triple negative primary tumor . Response define lack invasive tumor breast plus axilla neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( PCR , pathological complete response ) . Secondary Objective ( ) Secondary objectives follow : - To identify predictor good pathological response accord Symmans criterion ( i.e . Symmans class 0+1 ) . - To identify predictor chemoresistance ( class III od Symmans ) - To assess clinical response rate standard method ( MRI , clinical examination , mammogram ) patient treat regimen . - To evaluate breast conserve surgery rate patient treat regimen . - To evaluate pCR rate patient know BRCA mutation . STUDY DESIGN : Patients triple negative tumor accord core biopsy schedule treat docetaxel plus carboplatin ( i.e. , contraindication regimen ) candidate study . After detailed information study purpose , ask sign inform consent Triple negative status define ER &lt; 1 % stained cell , PR &lt; 1 % stained cell HER2 negative ( IHC 0-1+ 2-3+ FISH/CISH negative testing ) . Patients 6 cycle docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 IV day 1 ) plus carboplatin ( AUC 6 , IV day 1 ) every 3 week ( TCb regimen ) . Patients objective response stable disease undergo surgery sixth cycle . While treatment , patient assess clinically indicate discard progression breast MRI . A biopsy perform confirm progression patient remove study treat accord investigator 's criterion , usually anthracycline-containing regimen ( i.e . FE90C , 5FU 600 mg/m2 IV , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV , cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV , day 1 every 3 week ) . Patients achieve pathological complete response surgery receive additional chemotherapy ( radiation therapy administer indicate local criterion , i.e. , breast preserve surgery , large tumor &gt; 5 cm , axillary involvement ) . Those patient achieve pathological complete response surgery receive 3 additional cycle FE90C chemotherapy surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
