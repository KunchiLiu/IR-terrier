Dose stable throughout study unless clinically necessary adjust medication . Stable use antidepressant permit dos stable 3 month prior enrollment . Dose stable throughout study unless clinically necessary adjust medication . Dementia due probable Alzheimer 's disease Pregnancy , breastfeed . The rationale retinoids teratogenic excrete breast milk . History clinically significant stroke Modified Hachinski Ischemia score â‰¥ 4 Current evidence history past two year epilepsy , seizure , focal brain lesion , head injury loss consciousness DSM IV criterion major psychiatric disorder include psychosis , major depression , bipolar disorder , severe alcohol substance abuse . Sensory impairment would prevent subject participate cooperate protocol . Use another investigational agent within two month . Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory find render participant unsuitable receive investigational new drug include clinically significant unstable hematologic , hepatic , cardiovascular ( include history ventricular fibrillation ventricular tachycardia ) , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , endocrine , metabolic , renal , systemic disease laboratory abnormality . Abnormal liver function test , include AST , ALT , total bilirubin , prothrombin time . The rationale retinoids hepatotoxic . Participants receive behavioral medication ( include antidepressant , antipsychotic anxiolytic ) must stable dos least 4 week prior randomization . Active neoplastic disease medical condition require concurrent immunosuppression . Hypertriglyceridemia great 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy .

The rationale due enhance risk increase intracranial pressure . Hypersensitivity retinoids . Presence psychosis hallucination baseline determine Neuropsychiatric inventory Geriatric Depression Scaleshort form great equal five Presence unstable cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic inflammatory infectious condition . Retinoids associate chest pain unclear etiology , increase serum glucose , myelosuppression increase risk infection . Use Drugs supplement : Vitamin A supplement beyond 100 % RDA , immunosuppressant ( corticosteroid , chemotherapeutic agent , etc . ) , Warfarin , Fish Oil ( DHA ) Any disease medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make participant inappropriate entry clinical trial .</criteria>
