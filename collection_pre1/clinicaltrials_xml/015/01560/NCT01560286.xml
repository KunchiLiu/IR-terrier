	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Subcutaneously Administered rAvPAL-PEG Patients With Phenylketonuria 24 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary rationale study define optimal rAvPAL-PEG dose regimen establish therapeutic effect within short time possible time induction , titration maintenance phase reduce severity frequency hypersensitivity reaction may lead dose interruption . It hypothesize goal achieve keep rAvPAL-PEG dos low anti-PEG IgM response predict high titrate efficacious dose IgG response PAL develop . Further investigation need determine early quickly patient titrate safely low blood Phe ; therefore , protocol proposes assess two Groups use induction/titration maintenance schedule aim towards establish therapeutic effect safety within optimal period time .</detailed_description>

A prior reaction include systemic symptom ( eg , respiratory gastrointestinal problem , hypotension , angioedema , anaphylaxis ) PEG contain product . Patients prior systemic reaction generalize rash may eligible participation per discretion Principal Investigator consultation Sponsor 's Medical Officer . 5 . Pregnant breastfeed Screening plan become pregnant ( self partner ) breastfeed time study . 6 . Concurrent disease condition would interfere study participation safety ( eg , history presence clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , hematologic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , immunologic , dermatologic , neurological , oncologic , psychiatric disease ) . 7 . Any condition , view PI , place patient high risk poor treatment compliance complete study . 8 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) concentration &gt; 2 time upper limit normal . 9 .
