	<brief_title>European Bifurcation Club Trial - Two-stent Versus One-stent Technique Large Bifurcation Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment bifurcation coronary lesion remain difficult area , best practice yet establish . Prior era drug-eluting stent , limited data exist suggested strategy stenting main vessel , balloon angioplasty alone side-branch required superior stenting vessel . Randomised trial `` all-comer '' bifurcation lesion establish advantage systematic dual drug-eluting stent strategy . However , trial include patient disease side branch , small side branch vessel . Expert consensus suggest `` large '' bifurcation significant ostial side branch disease still merit systematic total lesion coverage stent technique . This trial therefore design assess hypothesis large true bifurcation significant side branch ostial disease successfully treat systematic culotte technique provisional T approach .</detailed_description>
