	<brief_summary>This randomized-controlled clinical trial randomize 120 patient undergoing clinically-indicated coronary artery bypass graft surgery prasugrel dose 10 mg daily match placebo 12 month , start time hospital dismissal surgery . The primary goal study determine whether prasugrel administration prevent thrombus ( clot ) formation within saphenous vein graft 12 month , examine optical coherence tomography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prasugrel Prevention Early Saphenous Vein Graft Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortocoronary saphenous vein graft failure common associate high morbidity mortality . Thrombus formation play critical role early saphenous vein graft occlusion may predispose subsequent atherosclerosis formation . Optical coherence tomography novel , high-resolution , intravascular imaging technique reliably identify thrombus . Based finding earlier VA Cooperative Studies , aspirin significantly reduce incidence early saphenous vein graft failure currently use nearly patient undergo coronary bypass graft surgery . Administration clopidogrel improve early saphenous vein graft patency provide conflict result small randomized study . Prasugrel novel thienopyridine provide rapid , consistent , intense platelet inhibition clopidogrel . However , patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery , remain unknown whether prasugrel may decrease thrombus formation saphenous vein graft first postoperative year , whether result less saphenous vein graft wall thickening , less lipid deposition saphenous vein graft wall few clinical event without increase risk severe bleeding . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize patient undergo clinically-indicated coronary artery bypass graft surgery , administration prasugrel start dismissal index coronary bypass graft surgery hospitalization result low prevalence thrombus formation target SVG , assess optical coherence tomography perform 12 month post surgery compare placebo , similar incidence major bleeding . This phase III , single-center , double-blind trial randomize 120 patient undergoing clinically-indicated coronary artery bypass graft surgery prasugrel dose 10 mg daily match placebo 12 month , start time hospital dismissal surgery . All patient receive aspirin . Coronary angiography , optical coherence tomography , intravascular ultrasonography , near-infrared spectroscopy one target saphenous vein graft perform 12 month determine whether compare placebo , administration prasugrel result : 1 . Reduction prevalence intragraft thrombus 12-month follow-up optical coherence tomography imaging ( primary efficacy endpoint ) 2 . Similar incidence severe bleed use Global Utilization Streptokinase t-PA Occluded Coronary Arteries ( GUSTO ) criterion ( primary safety endpoint ) 3 . Reduction incidence angiographic SVG failure ( defined 75 % SVG diameter stenosis least one SVG ) ; reduction total normalized total target saphenous vein graft atheroma volume , assess intravascular ultrasonography ; reduction saphenous vein graft lipid core burden index , assess near-infrared intracoronary spectroscopy 12-month follow-up cardiac catheterization ( secondary endpoint ) 4 . Reduction major adverse cardiac event , define composite death , acute coronary syndrome , coronary revascularization ) follow-up ( secondary endpoint )</detailed_description>
