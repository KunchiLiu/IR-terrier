	<brief_summary>Tamsulosin alpha blocker usually prescribe urinary complaint show benefit allow kidney stone pass ureter . Silodosin new alpha blocker act rapidly tamsulosin show specific receptor ureter . The investigator would like see benefit take silodosin tamsulosin extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) break kidney stone term allow ureteral fragment pass ureter . Our hypothesis silodosin least effective tamsulosin term allow stone pas , may allow pas quickly rapid onset action . The side effect profile drug quite similar tolerable . Patients may experience common side effect associate tamsulosin , include abnormal ejaculation , dizziness , rhinitis ( runny nose , sneeze ) , somnolence ( sleepiness ) . Serious reaction include orthostatic hypotension , syncope ( faint ) , priapism ( prolong undesired erection ) . Patients may experience common side effect silodosin tamsulosin include ejaculatory dysfunction , dizziness , postural hypotension , diarrhea , headache . Serious side effect rare include orthostatic hypotension , intra-operative floppy iris syndrome , syncope , priapism . Patients experience discomfort normally associate kidney stone . All effort make alleviate discomfort , include use study medication . Patients able take routine prescribe pain medication , ask keep record pain medication use . The investigator randomly enrol patient racial background gender . They must kidney stone range size 4mm 1.0 cm prior treatment study . The primary endpoint study clearance rate kidney stone . That , period time patient achieve clearance , stone free residual stone go . The secondary endpoint study include analgesic use , residual stone remain , need re-treatment , need intervention , steinstrasse clearance , need hospitalization .</brief_summary>
