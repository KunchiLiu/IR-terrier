	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn chemotherapy combination call modify Folfirinox ( mFolfirinox ) , follow combination gemcitabine radiation therapy , follow surgery , help control pancreatic cancer . The safety treatment also study . mFolfirinox consist 5-FU , oxaliplatin , irinotecan . These 3 drug , along gemcitabine , design block growth cancer cell , may lead cancer cell death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Folfirinox , Radiation Therapy Resectable Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : You receive 3 phase study therapy : systemic chemotherapy phase , chemoradiation phase , surgery , possible . During systemic chemotherapy phase , receive mFolfirinox 1 time every 2 week ( Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 11 ) 12 week . You receive oxaliplatin vein 2-hour period . After receive oxaliplatin , receive irinotecan vein 90-minute period . After receive irinotecan , receive 5-FU portable pump next 46 hour . You take portable pump home receive instruction use . You begin receive chemoradiation within 6 week finish receive Week 11 dose mFolfirinox . However , begin receive recover side effect chemotherapy . During chemoradiation phase , receive gemcitabine 35 minute 1 time week 5 week . You also receive radiation therapy 5 day week ( Monday Friday ) 5 1/2 week ( total 28 treatment ) . If miss day radiation , make end treatment receive full amount radiation . You give separate consent form explain radiation procedure risk may present . After chemoradiation phase , receive treatment 4-6 week body recover . If time disease gotten bad spread part body , surgery try remove tumor . You give separate consent form surgery describe perform risk . If disease gotten bad spread part body , able surgery . The study doctor discus therapy option . Study Visits : At Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 systemic chemotherapy phase : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Within 4 week begin chemoradiation phase : - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . At Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 chemoradiation phase : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) collect routine test . At Week 6 , additional 2 teaspoon blood drawn CTC testing . About 4 6 week complete chemoradiation phase : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . If eligible surgery chemoradiation phase , follow test procedure also perform : - Blood ( 4 teaspoon total ) drawn within 2 week surgery CTC testing . Blood also collect surgery , surgeon think safe feasible . - Tumor tissue collect previous procedure use biomarker test . An additional sample tumor tissue collect tissue remove surgery use biomarker test . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . Length Study : You receive study treatment course 30 week . You take study disease get bad , study doctor think best interest , follow study direction . You may choose stop receive study treatment time . If choose stop , tell study doctor member staff right away . They make sure proper procedure follow final visit schedule safety . Follow-up : Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect CTC test 2-3 month surgery , one first 30 participant enrol study . You CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis every 4 month 2 year check status disease . This investigational study . 5-FU , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available treat different type cancer : - 5-FU : pancreatic , gastric , breast , colon/rectum , skin cancer ( basal cell carcinoma ) - Oxaliplatin : colon rectal cancer - Irinotecan : colorectal cancer - Gemcitabine : pancreatic , lung , ovarian , breast cancer . The use 4 drug together combination radiation therapy treatment pancreatic cancer investigational . Up 33 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
