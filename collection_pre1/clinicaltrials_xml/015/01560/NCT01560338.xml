	<brief_title>Hypothermia 's Impact Pharmacology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Therapeutic hypothermia use pediatric intensive care unit , study set pediatric cardiac arrest . Following cardiac arrest , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome , especially renal hepatic dysfunction , common affect metabolism excretion drug . In addition , little known impact hypothermia child 's ability metabolize medication . Dose adjustment may require set hypothermia avoid under-dosing over-dosing medication . Improper dose drug accumulation sedatives opiates worsen exist neurologic , circulatory respiratory failure . The measurement actual drug metabolite concentration body ( pharmacokinetics ) provide information child metabolizes medication . In addition , variability concentration administration equal dose different child may result genetically driven difference drug metabolize system ( pharmacogenetics ) . Finally , genetic difference may respond differently hypothermia . Our overarch hypothesis morphine midazolam disposition affect temperature management even account potentially confound quantifiable factor organ dysfunction genetic difference . Objectives : The objective study , Hypothermia 's Impact Pharmacology 2 , 1 . To estimate impact hypothermia variability morphine midazolam pharmacokinetics child cardiac arrest 2 . To estimate impact genetic factor variability morphine midazolam pharmacokinetics , specifically set hypothermia . Sophisticated model simulation technique utilized examine highly dynamic change physiology associate critical illness , drug disposition , pharmacogenetics temperature modulation . The model create use approach implement optimize prospective treatment critically ill child . Study Design : Prospective pharmacokinetic study</detailed_description>
