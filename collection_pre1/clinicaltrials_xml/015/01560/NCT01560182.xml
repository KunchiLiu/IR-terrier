	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Metachromatic Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) autosomal recessive Lysosomal Storage Disorder ( LSD ) characterize severe progressive dysmyelination affect central peripheral nervous system . Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) ineffective ameliorate patient ' phenotype delay disease evolution . No evidence efficacy enzyme replacement strategy available moment . Transplantation genetically correct autologous hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) could represent novel potentially efficacious treatment MLD patient . We conduct gene therapy clinical trial base autologous HSC advance generation lentiviral vector ( LV ) patient affect severe , early onset form disease , base preclinical efficacy safety data experience acquire treatment Adenosine deaminase deficiency ( ADA-SCID ) patient similar approach . Our general goal demonstrate safety efficacy gene therapy approach MLD patient . We develop test clinically applicable LV contain ARSA cDNA control constitutive eukaryotic promoter sequence . Preclinical study aim assess efficacy safety ARSA gene transfer use select vector conduct murine model disease progenitor mature hematopoietic cell MLD patient . The following result obtain : 1. efficient ARSA gene transfer ; 2. long term vitro vivo multilineage ARSA expression ; 3. ability prevent correct neurological disease manifestation ; 4. good tolerance long-term safety treatment animal model . We expect treat 20 patient , select accord disease severity clinical feature . A myeloablative conditioning regimen base iv Busulfan administer patient enable engraftment transduce stem/progenitor cell bone marrow enhance CNS microglia/macrophage repopulation transduce cell progeny . An efficient transduction protocol base LVs optimized guarantee abundant ARSA expression transduce patient ' HSC progeny . In treated patient , study short-term long-term safety administration autologous transduce HSC , long-term engraftment , expression vector-derived ARSA , ability transduce cell provide clinical benefit patient . The treated patient follow 3 year thereafter monitor safety gene therapy additional 5 year . If successful , study provide key result safety efficacy gene therapy MLD patient .</detailed_description>
