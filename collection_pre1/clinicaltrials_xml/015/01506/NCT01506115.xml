	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient obstructive jaundice cause hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) dismal even biliary drainage ; due malfunction biliary drainage tube cause hemobilia and/or tumor embolus . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) hilar cholangiocarcinoma improve biliary drainage prolongs survival . The aim study assess safety efficacy PDT unresectable HCC bile duct invasion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Photodynamic Therapy Bile Duct Invasion Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As therapy available patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , survival rate improve . The incidence jaundice patient HCC report 5-44 % , substantial number patient experience obstructive jaundice . With improvement survival patient HCC , uncommon encounter HCC patient obstructive jaundice clinical practice . The prognosis patient obstructive jaundice cause HCC dismal due progressive liver failure , rapid tumor progression ineffective biliary drainage . The mean survival HCC obstructive jaundice biliary drainage range 2.5 4.5 month . Effective biliary drainage improve jaundice liver function inevitably need treatment . However , difficult maintain patency bile duct recurrent obstruction frequently develop due hemobilia . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) biliary drainage promise treatment option advance cholangiocarcinoma . Presence photosensitizer nontoxic , show light specific wavelength induce cytotoxicity . The systemically administrated photosensitizer accumulates preferentially proliferate tissue . If target lesion illuminate light specific wavelength , activate photosensitizer generates reactive oxygen specie , trigger cell death apoptosis necrosis cell specific area . Experience PDT cholangiocarcinoma suggest survival benefit achieve prolonged relief obstruction . The investigator hypothesize conduct PDT biliary stenting patient obstructive jaundice cause bile duct invasion HCC would improve stent patency clinical outcome . The aim study evaluate safety efficacy PDT HCC patient bile duct invasion .</detailed_description>
