	<brief_summary>What effect early high frequency oscillation ( HFO ) versus lung-protective conventional ventilation ( CV ) strategy ( use HFO rescue therapy ) , all-cause hospital mortality among patient severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Oscillation Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) Treated Early ( OSCILLATE ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High frequency oscillation theoretically ideal lung protection . Based strong physiological rationale , rapidly expand use internationally , promise result early small RCTS , definitive RCT establish impact HFO versus current conventional ventilation mortality need . We complete pilot multicentre RCT preparation trial , goal investigate patient recruitment , protocol acceptance , crossover rate . The pilot study meet objective include recruitment exceed expectation ( 94 patient ) , good adherence protocol . Results multinational OSCILLATE Trial establish impact HFO versus conventional ventilation mortality rate among adult severe ARDS .</detailed_description>
