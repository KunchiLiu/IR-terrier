	<brief_summary>Background rationale : In clinical practice , antihypertensives generally prescribe use morning , whereas statins recommend use evening .

Current product labelling recommends night use simvastatin state timing preference aspirin blood pressure lower medicine . There therefore uncertainty concern best time administration polypill . This uncertainty address trial . Trial design : Randomised , open label cross trial ( n=75 ) polypill morning compare even administration compare individual agent administration ( acetylsalicylic acid blood pressure lower agent morning , statin even ) individual high risk cardiovascular disease . Patients recruit RHP 2c ( acetylsalicylic acid 75mg , simvastatin 40mg , lisinopril 10mg , hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg ) , randomly allocate sequence time administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale : In clinical practice , antihypertensives generally prescribe use morning , whereas statins recommend use evening . There evidence reduction LDL cholesterol achieve statin superior take night , unclear whether additional reduction LDL cholesterol ( report improvement BP control aspirin take even ) offset reduction adherence take medication evening . Current product labelling recommends night use simvastatin state timing preference aspirin blood pressure lower medicine . There therefore uncertainty concern best time administration polypill . This uncertainty address trial . Trial design : Randomised , open label cross trial ( n=75 ) polypill morning compare even administration compare individual agent administration ( acetylsalicylic acid blood pressure lower agent morning , statin even ) individual high risk cardiovascular disease . Patients recruit RHP 2c ( acetylsalicylic acid 75mg , simvastatin 40mg , lisinopril 10mg , hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg ) , randomly allocate sequence time administration . Aim : To measure whether difference LDL cholesterol level 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure individual high risk cardiovascular disease polypill take morning compare evening . Randomisation trial treatment : Eligible individual willing participate trial receive polypill total 18 week randomise sequence 6 week morning , 6 week even administration 6 week administration individual agent . The polypill provide investigator Trial Centre . Participants also receive information smoking cessation ( applicable ) follow healthy heart diet . They advise increase physical activity lose weight need . Data collection follow-up : Participants followed-up 20 week . Ambulatory blood pressure measure baseline week 6 , week 12 week 18 . Fasting lipid measure baseline , week 6 , 12 18 . Tolerability assess week 6 , 12 , 18 20 adverse event . Participant acceptability measure end treatment period . Primary outcome : Difference LDL cholesterol mean 24 hour ambulatory systolic BP .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant able give inform consent . The trial Investigator considers polypill component indicated dos Red Heart Pill Established atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) intermediate high cardiovascular risk , define ; History coronary heart disease ( myocardial infarction , stable unstable angina pectoris , coronary revascularisation procedure ) , History ischaemic cerebrovascular disease ( ischaemic stroke transient ischaemic attack ) , History peripheral vascular disease ( peripheral revascularisation procedure amputation due vascular disease aortic reconstruction ) , For individual without establish cardiovascular disease , calculate 5 year CVD risk 5 % great ( calculate use 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation adjustment define New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendation ( Appendix 1 ) ) Contraindication component polypill ( e.g . know intolerance aspirin , statin , ACE inhibitor ; pregnancy likely become pregnant breastfeeding woman treatment period ) . Such contraindication fully list Investigator Brochures . The treat doctor considers change participant 's cardiovascular medication would put participant risk ( e.g . symptomatic heart failure , high dose Î²blocker require manage angina rate control atrial fibrillation , accelerate hypertension , severe renal insufficiency , history severe resistant hypertension ) . Other potential reason exclusion include : Known situation medication regimen might alter significant length time , e.g . current acute cardiovascular event , plan coronary bypass graft operation . Unlikely complete trial ( e.g . lifethreatening condition cardiovascular disease ) adhere trial procedure attend study visit ( e.g . major psychiatric condition , dementia ) . Any reason , medical condition , ongoing medication significant disability would prevent participant comply trial consent , treatment followup procedure potentially jeopardise / medical care .
