	<brief_title>Thromboelastography During After Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous , preliminary investigation use thromboelastography , confirm pregnancy hypercoaguable state remain first 24 hour postdelivery . Unfortunately result obtain exist study attempt establish reference value TEG suffer considerable bias . The aim study determine range value thomboelastography pregnant woman . Since available information expect distribution outcome , sequential design use . The main endpoint analysis reliable estimate outcome expect healthy woman labor . The investigator state target estimate reliable ratio estimate standard error small 2 . During labor , 2 hour delivery 24 hour postpartum , venous blood sample take eligible woman thromboelastographic determination . Whole blood nonadditive TEM perform TEM-A automate thromboelastometer ( Framar Biomedica , Rome , Italy ) obtain four classical TEM parameter : reaction ( R ) time , k time , alpha angle maximum amplitude ( MA ) . Inclusion criterion Healthy parturients labor Exclusion criterion parturients eventually : operative instrumental vaginal delivery , estimate blood loss great 500 mL , occurrence II III degree perineal laceration , coagulation disorder anticoagulant therapy</detailed_description>
