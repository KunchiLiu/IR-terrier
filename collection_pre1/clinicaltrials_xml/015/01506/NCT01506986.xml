	<brief_summary>HEAT ( Helicobacter Eradication Aspirin Trial ) large simple double-blind placebo control outcome study Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) eradication prevent ulcer bleed aspirin user . It run University Nottingham , recruit centre across UK . This trial fund National Institute Health Research Health Technology Assessment ( NIHR HTA ) Programme . Aspirin use widespread increase elderly patient . The main hazard gastrointestinal bleeding , may increase increase aspirin use . This trial base evidence peptic ulcer bleed aspirin user occur predominantly H. pylorus positive people . Patients identified GPs , ask attend appointment Research Nurse consent trial take H. pylorus breath test . Those positive result randomise receive one week course either eradication treatment placebo . No follow-up visit require , instead information extract patient ' electronic medical record use MiQuest search tool . The trial continue 87 adjudicated event ( hospitalisation definite probable peptic ulcer bleed ) occur , would occur mean 2.5 patient year follow-up , trial assumption correct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Aspirin use widespread increase elderly patient . The main hazard gastrointestinal bleeding , incidence rising , probably increase aspirin use . The propose trial base evidence peptic ulcer bleed aspirin user occur predominantly people infect ulcerogenic bacterium , Helicobacter pylorus . Our hypothesis low dos aspirin cause ulcer way high dos . Instead think H. pylori cause ulcer aspirin , thin blood , make bleed . If bacterium eradicate patient get ulcer therefore increase bleed risk aspirin . Development trial protocol base result preparatory Medical Research Council-funded 2525 patient pilot study 47 % patient response rate . This enable u design currently propose large simple outcome study investigate directly hypothesis one week course H. pylori eradication halve rate hospitalisation due ulcer bleed ~2.5 year aspirin user . TRIAL CONDUCT : A large number patient ( ~170,000 ) , use aspirin &lt; 326 mg daily invite participate . Suitable respondent ( ~33,000 ) H. pylorus positive ( ~6,600 ) give consent ( include access Hospital Episode Statistics Office National Statistics mortality data ) randomise eradication treatment placebo . There follow-up trial visit 90 % patient . Instead MiQuest tool , developed interrogate different GP electronic database , use together direct patient notification identify possible ulcer bleed admission . An expert panel use validate methodology adjudicate whether patient suffer ulcer bleeding ( primary endpoint ) . The trial continue 87 positively adjudicated event occur , ensure power answer question whether H. pylorus eradication reduces risk ulcer bleed .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female ≥ 60 year age date screening . Subjects take aspirin ≤325mg daily 4 28day prescription last year . Subjects concurrently use antiplatelet agent allow enter study . Subjects willing able undergo breath test H. pylorus , include fast 6 hour , whose result unequivocally positive ( result breath test determine postscreening ) . Subjects willing give permission paper electronic medical record access abstracted trial investigator . Subjects willing contact interviewed trial investigator , need arise adverse event assessment , etc . Subjects must able communicate well investigator designee , understand comply requirement study understand sign write informed consent . Subjects currently prescribe antiulcer therapy H2receptor antagonists protonpump inhibitor . Subjects currently prescribe oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Subjects know intolerance allergy H. pylori eradication treatment . Subjects take drug clinically significant interaction H. pylori eradication treatment . Subjects terminally ill suffer lifethreatening comorbidity . Subjects whose behaviour lifestyle would render less likely comply study medication ( eg . alcoholism , substance abuse , debilitate psychiatric condition inability provide inform consent ) . Subjects currently participate another interventional clinical trial take part trial previous three month .</criteria>
