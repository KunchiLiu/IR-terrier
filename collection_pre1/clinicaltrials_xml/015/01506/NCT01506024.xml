	<brief_summary>The aim present study explore efficient surgical approach total hip replacement short long term concern strength , functionality postoperative complication . The objective register muscular strength , hip joint functionality/mobilisation complication total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) perform direct lateral approach ( DLA ) , posterior approach ( PA ) anterior approach ( AA ) . The latter modify Smith-Petersen approach follow principle minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) . The primary working hypothesis due minimal dissection reduce trauma muscle , patient tolerate early hospital discharge well AA PA DLA . Patients AA group also think active maintain muscular strength hip joint functionality/mobilisation well patient lateral group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimal Invasive Surgery Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients ; Short- Long Term Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With total hip replacement surgery , orthopaedic surgeon 's aim pain relief patient , also restoration hip joint biomechanics result minimal functional deficit maximal longevity implant . It exceptional patient still experience mild moderate long-term impairment postoperatively . These impairment include pain , muscle weakness hip abductor , contracture hip , gait disorder , well weakness hip extensor flexor . These problem may turn lead complication joint instability loosening implant . MIS define surgical approach perform short skin muscle incision avoid injury muscle tendon . Following minimally invasive approach reduce muscle trauma find . Moreover clinical outcome improve , gluteus medius muscle spar successfully . However , debate whether overall result MIS superior , even good traditional hip replacement surgery term component place time revision prosthesis .</detailed_description>
