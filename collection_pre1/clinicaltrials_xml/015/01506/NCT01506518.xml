	<brief_title>Double Push Acoustic Radiation Force ( DP ARF ) Ultrasound Monitoring Degeneration Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double Push Acoustic Radiation Force ( DP ARF ) image perform 3 cohort 10 boy DMD age-matched boy know neuromuscular disorder . The first DMD cohort enroll age 5-6 , second age 7-8 , third age 9-10 . The rectus femoris ( RF ) , cranial sartorius ( CS ) , gastrocnemius ( GAST ) , lateral deltoid ( DT ) muscle target known phenotypic variation response dystrophin deficiency . The RF undergoes early necrosis fatty deposition , CS think relatively spared , GAST seem undergo true hypertrophy . The DT , undergoes hypertrophy like GAST , also examine determine impact dystrophin deficiency varies upper low limb . All boy image 3 time annually 4 year . In addition DP ARF image every 4 mo , boys undergo standard quantitative muscle test ( QMT ) time function test ( TFT ) time stand , 6-minute walk , 30-feet walk . Age loss ambulation also record boy . Boys DMD generally loose ambulation age 10 , expect 20 boys 7-11 9-13 aged cohort lose ambulation course study . The 10 boy 5-9 age cohort likely lose ambulation study . Because primary objective clinical investigation evaluate potential DP ARF image relevant surrogate monitoring disease progression response therapy , focus study correlate DP ARF result change functional degeneration time loss ambulation . There two experimental component study beyond standard practice DMD patient : 1 ) DP ARF ultrasound image rectus femoris ( RF ) , cranial sartorius ( CS ) , gastrocnemius ( GAST ) , lateral deltoid ( DT ) muscle 2 ) standard quantitative muscle test ( QMT ) time function test ( TFTs ) time stand , 6-minute walk , 30-feet walk repeat every four month ( three time annually ) throughout four-year duration study . This study commence DP ARF ultrasound image Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory patient volunteer 's first regularly schedule research visit . Patient volunteer expect outpatient . However , patient volunteer inpatient , DP ARF ultrasound image may perform patient volunteer 's hospital bedside . Immediately follow DP ARF examination , patient volunteer undergo QMT TFTs Physical Therapy Department . QMT TFT conduct trained physical therapist . DP ARF ultrasound imaging , QMT TFT repeat described patient volunteer ' twelve regularly schedule research visit four-year study duration . Whenever possible , schedule research visit coincide clinical visit UNC . The patient ' parent caregiver compensate $ 50 per visit defray cost travel UNC , park lunch . DP ARF also perform 30 boy ages 5-14 know neuromuscular disorder . Imaging perform described boy DMD . The DP ARF result obtain boys known neuromuscular disorder compare obtain boy neuromuscular disorder serve control change muscle mechanical property occur normal muscle growth development . DP ARF ultrasound noninvasive diagnostic imaging technology perform use commercially available clinical ultrasound image equipment - Siemens Acuson Antares image system equip research purpose VF10-5 VF7-3 linear array transducer ( Siemens Medical Solutions , USA Inc. Ultrasound Division ) . DP ARF image carry professional sonographer , faculty and/or graduate student research assistants UNC-CH Joint Department Biomedical Engineering . The sonographer acquire DP ARF ultrasound data match B-Mode ( anatomical reference ) right RF , CS , GAST , DT muscle patient volunteer . Patient volunteer ask lie examination table Clinical Neurophysiology Clinic ( outpatient ) remain hospital bed ( inpatient ) . The head exam table/bed may raise approximate 45 degree angle best visualize muscle interest ultrasound image . Once patient volunteer position , ultrasound gel apply patient volunteer 's skin surface muscle interest . The ultrasound imaging transducer place top gel . Once first muscle interest locate , DP ARF ultrasound image begin . We orient transducer acquire ultrasound data transverse muscle fiber middle muscle length-wise , three repeat acquisition . We rotate transducer 90 degree orient image plane parallel muscle fiber . The previously image cross-section position approximate middle image field view , three repeat acquisition . Muscle fiber orientation approximate , surmise anatomy . The DP ARF axial focal depth direct center muscle , approximately 20 - 30 mm . The length time DP ARF data collection muscle estimate less 10 minute . Once DP ARF image complete one muscle , DP ARF image perform muscle interest . Once 4 muscle ( RF , CS , GAST DT ) image , study procedure complete DP ARF image portion study . For second part study , begin shortly ( less 4 hour ) DP ARF imaging complete , patient volunteer undergo clinically standard quantitative muscle test ( QMT ) maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) right RF , CS , GAST DT . The patient volunteer also undergo clinically standard time function test ( TFTs ) ( 1 ) time rise supine standing , ( 2 ) distance walk six minute ( 3 ) time walk 30 foot . Patient volunteer ' participation end study part one ( DP ARF ultrasound image ) two ( QMT TFT ) complete twelve time 4 year . Therefore , regularly schedule follow-up visit require patient volunteer every four month . The patient volunteer ask assent parent ask permit son undergo ( 1 ) DP ARF ultrasound image right RF , CS , GAST DT muscle , ( 2 ) QMT TFTs time stand , 6-minute walk , 30-feet walk . No additional procedure requirement propose . Every aspect patient volunteer ' care DMD carry normal standard care clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
