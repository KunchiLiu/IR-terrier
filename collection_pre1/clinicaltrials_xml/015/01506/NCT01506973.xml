	<brief_summary>In Phase I/II clinical trial , investigator seek pilot addition Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) commonly-used front-line therapy pancreatic cancer , gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel . The investigator plan run-in define tolerable dos , explore dos 800 1200 mg/day successive cohort 6 patient . The investigator assess toxicity continuously , determine dose Phase II trial base standard toxicity criterion . The correlative endpoint trial direct pharmacokinetics HCQ , pharmacokinetic model HCQ base data several ongoing trial , data patient contribute refine model . The investigator analyze measure model-predicted index relationship autophagy induction . Autophagy assess accumulation autophagocytic vesicle PMNs treat patient , together induction expression autophagy-related protein western analysis , quantitated densitometry . The investigator document rate metabolic response consequence treatment , therapeutic marker may relate degree autophagy inhibition . Since investigator previously demonstrate key role JNK1 induction autophagy chemotherapy , investigator analyze archival tumor material determine variability marker , baseline potential future trial . Finally , study incorporate metabolic profile mass spectrometry , related mutation ( include Kras ) pretreatment tumor specimen . Mutational analysis accomplish targeted sequence next-generation sequencing , need fresh tissue endpoint require patient biopsy perform treatment 6-8 week begin treatment . In previous study Hh inhibitor GDC-0973 chemotherapy , investigator able obtain repeat biopsy successfully patient . The importance biopsy , move science forward era tool exist provide meaningful correlative science , overstate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II/Pharmacodynamic Study Hydroxychloroquine Combination With Gemcitabine/Abraxane Inhibit Autophagy Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent strategy focus improve efficacy gemcitabine either improve method delivery , combine gemcitabine non-cross resistant agent . A sequence Phase III combination study gemcitabine combination ( oxaliplatin , targeted therapy bevacizumab cetuximab ) negative , though base strikingly positive Phase II data generate cancer center . Several study suggest taxanes active pancreatic cancer , randomize trial gemcitabine taxanes preform , probably basis difference Phase II insufficiently persuasive . The development novel taxane conjugate albumin , abraxane , establish activity breast cancer , prompt Phase II trial gemcitabine/abraxane Von Hoff ( 6 ) . Phase I/II data highly promise , response rate order 40 % , tolerable toxicity , one-year survival 48 % . A phase III trial gemcitabine versus gemcitabine/abraxane progress , base promising data serve control chemotherapy previous SU2C trial . The development intensive , toxic regimen ( FOLFIRINOX ) way diminishes enthusiasm chemotherapy backbone , give activity Phase II trial appear comparable ( 7 ) . Given promise regimen , possibility make substantial improvement outcome additional targeted intervention , propose continue use regimen current study . Of particular interest extend study pancreatic cancer find autophagy inhibition particularly deleterious cell line bear mutant Kras protein . Additional study part SU2C pancreatic cancer project reveal autophagy program activate presence mutant Kras , thus prompt test strategy set Kras commonly ( 85 % ) mutate ( SU2C , unpublished data ) .</detailed_description>
