	<brief_summary>The investigator propose test causality examine cohort patient undergoing deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) within ventral striatum . The investigator examine behavior stimulation across range task index different form impulsivity . Patients study ON OFF state - , test active deep brain stimulation 30 min 1 hour stimulation stop ( order state counterbalance across subject ) . The investigator specific aim test hypothesis enhance ventral striatal signaling ( i.e . ON-state DBS ) cause impulsive pattern behavior across several impulsivity task . The investigator predict ventral striatal DBS increase stop-signal reaction time stop-signal task commission error Go/NoGo task , increase delay aversion delay discount paradigm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study take place clinical office Charlestown Navy Yard ( CNY ) , consist 1 4 4.5-hour visit . Study staff schedule convenient time patient arrive , research visit may pair regularly schedule DBS program visit . A member Division Neurotherapeutics authorize manipulate DBS program turn device ON OFF study . The subject 's therapeutic parameter DBS system change . The subject ask complete two impulsivity questionnaire : UPPS+P Impulsive Behavior Scale Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( BIS-11 ) . Following questionnaire , DBS stimulation turn member study staff teach subject perform follow task computer : Stop-Signal Task To measure `` impulsive action , '' use stop-signal task ( SST ) , well-validated measure response inhibition know impaired substance abuser . In 192 trial ( 3 block 64 ; 10 interval block , 2 ISI ) , subject see fixation cue ( 250ms ) replace shape ( square circle ) . Participants tell make shape judgment press appropriate computer key . On no-signal trial ( 75 % ) , subject instruct respond stimulus fast accurately possible . On stop-signal trial ( 25 % ) , stimulus follow auditory stop signal , subject instruct withhold responding . On stop-signal trial , stop signal present variable delay ( SSD ) , initially set 250 msec adjust continuously staircase procedure 50ms depend whether inhibition successful ( increase ) unsuccessful ( decrease ) . The paradigm administer use precompiled software provide Gordon Logan , automatically analyze relevant dependent variable ( e.g stop-signal reaction time [ SSRT ] GoRT ) . This task take approximately 20 minute . Rewarded Variant This task variant , inclusion `` point possible cue '' ( 2 50 point ) 500 m , follow brief delay ( 500-1500 m ) prior target . The task present 13 block . The first contains go trial , initial SSD calculate . The 12 subsequent block consist 40 trial ; 18 standard go trial , 12 high reward ( HR ) go trial , 6 standard stop trial , 4 HR stop trial , present random order . The SSD determine simple staircase-tracking algorithm describe Logan , SSD adjust 25 m order establish SSD produce 50 % accuracy successful performance , separate staircase calculate HR standard trial . Outcome measure standard high reward GoRTs , standard HR SSRTs , proportion response would unsuccessfully stop HR trial standard SSD utilized instead HR SSD . Rewarded Go/NoGo Task In task , participant ask make , withhold , button press one six stimulus ( shape ) , correspond six trial type : Go ( reward ) , Go ( low reward ) , Go ( high reward ) , NoGo ( reward ) , NoGo ( low reward ) , NoGo ( high reward ) . Participants ask press button Go stimuli withhold button press NoGo stimulus . The ratio Go stimuli NoGo stimuli approximately 15:1 . Participants win money correctly press button Go stimuli withhold response NoGo stimulus ; conversely , lose money fail respond Go stimuli fail withhold response NoGo stimulus . There 1260 trial , last 1 second . The task take 20 minute complete . Task may administer without reward contingency . In case , two trial type : Go NoGo . Delay Discounting Task To measure `` impulsive choice '' use delay-discounting ( DD ) paradigm101 . On trial , participant make binary choice smaller/sooner larger/later reward . The delay sooner reward set today , 2 week , &amp; 1 month ; delay later reward range 2 6 week early reward . The sooner reward 1 % 50 % less late reward ( max = $ 40 ) . Participants complete approximately 80 trial . Participants tell two choice randomly select payout appropriate time . Outcome variable include proportion choice immediate/sooner reward , well discount parameter k , obtain fitting choice data subject hyperbolic discount function . The task take approximately 15 minute complete . 30 minute turn OFF DBS stimulation , participant either remain OFF condition DBS turn ON , depend counter-balanced condition assignment . Subjects complete task first condition . Following task completion , subject DBS stimulation turn OFF ON ( , depend condition assignment ) . After 30 minute , participant complete task second condition . Following retesting , participant OFF condition return ON DBS stimulation . We use implanted pulse generator deliver safe current . Because change therapeutic parameter stimulation , subject experience change ON condition . Should discomfort arise OFF condition , subject able terminate study return ON condition immediately . The computer register subject 's performance . Electroencephalography recording ( EEG ) acquire performance aforementioned task . Continuous EEG data sample maximum 1024Hz use 64-electrode cap . Eye movement artifact assess use bipolar electrode . Patients major depressive disorder obsessive compulsive disorder also recruit control group patient deep brain stimulation .</detailed_description>
