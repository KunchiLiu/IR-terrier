	<brief_summary>Hydroxyurea ( HU ) approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat adult sickle cell anemia . Hydroxyurea also test used child sickle cell anemia . However , many study describe disposition drug child less 5 year old . The FDA request study well understand child age 2 17 year sickle anemia absorb eliminate drug ( call pharmacokinetics ) . The investigator measure much Hydroxyurea ( HU ) get bloodstream different time point take medication .</brief_summary>

Weight ≥ 10 kg . Participants may may currently receive hydroxyurea . If participant take hydroxyurea , last dose must less 24 hour prior start study . Participant `` well '' state ( i.e . least 2 week since last vasoocclusive crisis , acute chest syndrome episode , splenic sequestration episode ) . Clinical evidence normal gastrointestinal function structure . No clinical evidence hepatic compromise include transaminase 3 time upper limit normal . A glomerular filtration rate ( GFRestimated serum creatinine use ageappropriate , validate equation Schwartz equation ) &gt; 70 ml/min/1.73m2 know renal impairment ( creatinine 1.5 time upper limit normal age screen laboratory ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) ≥5th ≤ 95th percentile per CDC growth chart . The parent guardian willing able provide sign dated write informed consent form prior study related procedure . When appropriate , participant sign assent participate accord local IRB guideline .
