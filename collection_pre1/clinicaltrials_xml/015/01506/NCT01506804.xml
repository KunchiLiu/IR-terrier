	<detailed_description>For many patient unspecific pain reduce motion shoulder common complaint . It believe main reason shoulder pain come inflammation bursa . Many patient experience effect steroid injection , however effect often short last recurrence symptom common . Exercise therapy muscle around shoulder joint also common treatment shoulder pain . The short term effect injection show much well exercise therapy ; however time superior effect injection compare exercise last . The anti-inflammatory pain release effect steroid injection combination exercise therapy increase strength control muscle around shoulder joint , might sufficient therapy injection alone . Thus , aim study investigate combination steroid injection 10 week exercise program patient painful shoulder . Many different clinical test use examine pathological compression bursa motion shoulder joint ( impingement ) . However , actually know pain motion cause compression bursa . Part study therefore test validity clinical impingement test use ultrasound verified impingement gold standard . Studies compare injection give guide ultrasound blind injection show ultrasound guide injection likely place active stuff correctly swell bursa . In study injection give ultrasound guided . In ultrasound examination thickness bursa measure patient order investigate swollenness bursa explain pain dysfunction shoulder joint</detailed_description>
