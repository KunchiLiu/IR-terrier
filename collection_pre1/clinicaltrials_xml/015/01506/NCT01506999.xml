	<brief_summary>The main objective GENOCOR project ( Genetic mapping cardiac risk assessment ) set joint public/private laboratory ( GENOCOR-LAB ) dedicate development test new cost-effective technology exploit grow knowledge genomic correlate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) evolution ; data obtain GENOCOR-Lab especially orient secondary prevention specific treatment ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Mapping Cardiac Risk Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Laboratory base premise CNR Institute Clinical Physiology , research institution operate CVD Research Hospital System , two Hospital Units ( CNR Campus Pisa G. Pasquinucci Hospital Massa ) . The project base cooperation national private company ( DiaSorin , endow promising proprietary technology novel diagnostic biotechnology ) three research unit ( clinical molecular biology level ) two National Research Council ( IFC-CNR , Pisa ITB-CNR , Milano , active advance biological research ) one University Vita-Salute San Raffaele ( UHSR , Milano , operate top range hospital center advance biological research ) : GENOCOR Lab become first product cooperation within CNR MERIT Network ( MEdical Reseach ITaly ) currently set-up CNR . The project base availability proprietary large scale database select clinical population probe novel genomic post-genomic technology . High throughput SNPs technology post-genomic expression proteomic analysis use assess profile genetic variability identify subject distinct proneness ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , hard cardiovascular event unfavourable outcome . Specific focus make possible availability , within propose research network , well establish clinical data base biological sample collection , enable retrospective prospective access large well characterised population patient IHD . Cardiovascular phenotype include patient acute coronary syndrome ( unstable angina acute myocardial infarction ) patient chronic ischemic heart disease prolong follow-up ; approach , possible cover short-term long-term evolution detail clinical , biohumoral instrumental phenotyping time acute event systematic follow-up . This approach allow overcome major limitation unbalance previous study , either focus small well characterized population genetic variation explore , extend large population wider gene variability approach inadequate information phenotype evolution disease .</detailed_description>
