	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability add 125 mg 250 mg dos MK-7655 imipenem/cilastatin adult 18 year older Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection ( cIAI ) . The primary hypothesis MK-7655 + imipenem/cilastatin treatment regimen non-inferior treatment imipenem/cilastatin alone respect proportion participant favorable clinical response completion intravenous ( IV ) study therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinically suspect and/or bacteriologically document cIAI require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic therapy . Enrolled intraoperatively postoperatively basis operative finding OR enrol preoperatively basis compel preoperative clinical finding . Infection manage Staged Abdominal Repair ( STAR ) open abdomen technique . APACHE II score great 30 . Any amount effective antibiotic therapy obtain culture admission study prior administration first dose IV study therapy . An infection treat &gt; 24 hour systemic antibiotic therapy know effective presume documented etiologic pathogen ( ) within 72hour period immediately prior consideration entry study . History serious allergy , hypersensitivity ( e.g. , anaphylaxis ) , serious reaction carbapenem antibiotic , cephalosporin , penicillin , βlactam agent . History serious allergy , hypersensitivity ( e.g. , anaphylaxis ) , serious reaction βlactamase inhibitor ( e.g. , tazobactam , sulbactam , clavulanic acid ) . History seizure disorder ( require ongoing treatment anticonvulsive therapy prior treatment anticonvulsive therapy last 3 year ) . Currently treat valproic acid use valproic acid 2 week prior screen . Rapidly progressive terminal illness ( unlikely survive approximately 6 8week study period ) . Pregnant expect conceive , breastfeeding , plan breast feed within 1 month completion study . Participant response IV study therapy within timeframe treatment specify protocol consider unlikely . Concurrent infection would interfere evaluation response study antibiotic . Need concomitant systemic antimicrobial agent addition designate various study treatment group . cIAI due confirm fungal pathogen . Currently receive immunosuppressive therapy , include use highdose corticosteroid . Prior recipient renal transplantation . Estimated actual creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute . History illness , opinion investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk administer study drug patient . Laboratory abnormality specify protocol . Currently participate , participate clinical study involve administration investigational experimental medication ( licensed regulatory agency ) time presentation previous 30 day prior screen anticipate participate clinical study course trial .</criteria>
