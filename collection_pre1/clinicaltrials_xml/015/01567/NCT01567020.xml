	<detailed_description>The current conflict Afghanistan ( Operation Enduring Freedom ; OEF ) Iraq ( Operation Iraqi Freedom ; OIF ) result unprecedented rate exposure high-intensity blast result brain injury . Dennis ( 2009 ) report 2005-2007 , 68 % U.S. military personnel injure OEF/OIF conflict blast-related injury 28 % -31 % evacuated Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) , Washington , DC brain injury . While common focus auditory evaluation damage peripheral auditory system , prevalence brain injury among exposed high-intensity blast suggest damage central auditory system equally important concern blast-exposed Veteran . Discussions clinical audiologists OEF/OIF Veterans Service Office personnel suggest common complaint voice blast-exposed Veterans inability understand speech noisy environment , even peripheral hearing within normal near-normal limit ( see attach letter support ) . Such complaint consistent damage neural network responsible higher-order auditory processing . This proposal second phase research project focus examine degree central auditory processing ( CAP ) dysfunction result blast exposure . Over initial period funding , data collection WRAMC VA RR &amp; D National Center Rehabilitative Auditory Research ( NCRAR ) establish CAP dysfunction present Warfighters expose high-intensity blast serve combat . Recently blast-exposed patient without diagnosis mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) test WRAMC show difference control test NCRAR one behavioral neurophysiological test use evaluate central auditory function . This project 1 ) develop accurate estimate prevalence central auditory dysfunction among Veterans expose blast past ten year , 2 ) identify functional outcome associate abnormal performance test central processing , 3 ) improve understand way blast-exposure resembles differs normal age process non-blast-related TBI term performance test central auditory processing . Key Question 1 : To extent CAP dysfunction observable among OEF/OIF Veterans expose high intensity blast ? Based preliminary data , investigator hypothesize rate abnormal performance behavioral neurophysiological test CAP dysfunction high group Veterans expose blast control group similar age hear threshold expose blast . Key Question 2 : How well behavioral neurophysiological test CAP predict functional auditory deficit measure behaviorally self report ? It hypothesize test CAP ability predict performance test situation involve multiple talker deliver compete message . CAP test also correlate response blast-exposed Veterans make Speech Spatial Qualities Hearing ( SSQ ) questionnaire , design examine functional hearing ability various acoustically complex environment . Key Question 3 : To extent blast-exposed Veterans resemble old listener participant mild TBI expose blast performance CAP test functional test hear ? It hypothesize comparison blast-exposed group old group match pure-tone sensitivity age- hearing-matched group non-blast-related TBI consistent premature age blast-exposed group demonstrate substantive difference non-blast group .</detailed_description>
