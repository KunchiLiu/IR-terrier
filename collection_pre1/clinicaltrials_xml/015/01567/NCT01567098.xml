	<brief_title>Single Incision Versus Conventional 3-Port Laparoscopic Appendectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction single incision laparoscopic surgery ( SILS ) , approach become popular various case series report describe feasibility many general surgical procedure include appendectomy , cholecystectomy , colectomy . Despite , strong evidence support SILS equivalent even superior conventional multi-port approach remain scarce , although case series comparative study promise result cholecystectomy colectomy . There many case series available state single incision appendectomy may feasible alternative conventional approach , may expense long operating time high post operative wound pain score . A recent randomized trial St. Peter et al . first test feasibility approach standard 3-port approach appendectomy child . Under randomized setting trial single incision appendectomy produce long operate time result great charge . However , primary outcome measure trial wound infection result show significant difference two approach . The answer whether single incision appendectomy produce long operating time compare conventional 3-port approach remain undetermined , particular adult population , therefore randomized trial design base operating time primary outcome desire .</detailed_description>
