	<brief_title>Collecting Studying Tissue Samples From Patients With HIV-Associated Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To obtain high-quality , clinically annotated tissue patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 malignancy . - To study clinical , genetic , immunologic parameter prognostic significance and/or involve initiation progression HIV-1 malignancy , include complete genomic sequence determination HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , lung cancer , anal cancer , cervical cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo tumor , lymph node , bone marrow , skin biopsy , peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection . Samples submit AIDS Malignancy Consortium ( AMC ) Biorepository transfer AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource ( ACSR ) . Samples analyze Genome Science Center British Columbia ( GSC-BC ) HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project ( HTMCP ) full genomic sequence analysis may include , limited , array-based gene expression profiling , comparative genome hybridization , single nucleotide polymorphism study flow cytometry , cytogenetics , molecular study . Patients ' clinical data , demographic , treatment give also collect prospectively order record treatment outcome toxicity . Patients follow 6 month , 1 year , 2 year data-reporting purpose .</detailed_description>
