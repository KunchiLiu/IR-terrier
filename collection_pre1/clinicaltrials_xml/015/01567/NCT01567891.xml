	<brief_summary>This study , take subject 's `` T cell '' `` teach '' able recognize attack ovarian cancer cell . This do put gene genetic material change subject 's T cell work hopefully get attack kill ovarian cancer cell . These new T cell call `` engineered T cell '' new gene cause become directed toward ovarian cancer cell rather usual target . These also call `` gene-modified T cell '' . For subject HLA A2 tissue-type marker , T cell would engineer recognize substance call `` NY-ESO-1 '' . After put new gene T cell ( procedure call `` gene therapy '' ) investigator grow cell laboratory give cell back subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Antigen TCR-redirected T Cells Ovarian Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label clinical trial . Patients HLA-A201 , HLA-A205 , and/or HLA-A206 allele whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen eligible receive NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T . The trial conduct entirely outpatient procedure ; however , patient may hospitalize cytoreductive chemotherapy discretion investigator . Upon enrollment , patient undergo leukapheresis T cell collection , cell genetically engineer expand ex vivo . Seven day prior receive T-cells patient undergo cyclophosphamide condition regimen potentiate immunotherapy . The cell product infuse single infusion ( Day 0 , typically Monday ) mitigate risk associate unanticipated infusion reaction . Patients follow daily first week , weekly 4 week , 8 week , 12 week 6 month every 3 month disease progression . Patients undergo disease monitoring MRI/CT scan ( appropriate disease ) baseline , day 28 , 8 week 12 week , month 6 , every 3 month progression . Tumor biopsies take baseline , Week 8 , upon progression . In patient progressive disease follow initial infusion whose tumor continue express NY-ESO-1 , patient may eligible second infusion redirect T cell . At disease progression , interventional portion protocol end long term follow-up ( LTFU ) begin , accordance FDA regulation . LTFU occur semiannually 5 year post infusion annually thereafter 15 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must diagnosis recurrent epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma refractory platinum resistant disease and/or receive ≥ 2 line chemotherapy Age ≥ 18 year age No significant immunodeficiency Have inform treatment option Must HLA A*0201 , HLAA*0205 , and/or HLAA*0206 positive high resolution test . Patient 's tumor must positive histological assay NYESO1ᶜ²⁵⁹T , accord screen algorithm describe Section 3.3.1 . Positive expression define ≥ 50 % cell 2+ and/or 3+ immunohistochemistry ECOG performance status 0 1 Life expectancy &gt; 4 month Prior therapy : 1. prior immunotherapy , prior investigational agent wash 4 week apheresis must complete 4 week prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy . 2. monoclonal antibody therapy must complete least 6 week prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy 3 . All previous cytotoxic chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , immune therapy wash 3 week apheresis must complete least 3 week prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy . 4 . Systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy wash 2 week apheresis must complete least 2 week prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy 5 . Biologic approve molecular target small molecule inhibitor wash 1 week apheresis must complete least 1 week prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy . 6 . Any grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity previous therapy must resolve grade 2 less prior apheresis grade 3 4 toxicity must resolve grade 2 less prior preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy . Must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . Must adequate venous access apheresis . Women childbearing potential request use acceptable method birth control duration study persistence study drug longer detect patient . This may period several year . Methods acceptable birth control include : condom , diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , intrauterine device , hormonal contraception . It recommend combination two method use . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal Patient must understand investigational nature study sign Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approve write informed consent form prior receive study related procedure . Currently receive investigational agent Patients active brain metastasis . Patients prior history brain metastasis undergone local therapy ( i.e . metastatectomy and/or radiation ) show evidence local recurrence progression past 6 month eligible History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cyclophosphamide agent use study Prior malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within 18 month study entry NOTE : Patients must complete remission prior malignancy order eligible enter study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Use chronic corticosteroid , hydroxyurea , immunomodulating agent ( e.g . interleukin2 , interferonalpha gamma , granulocyte colony stimulate factor , etc . ) within 30 day prior study entry . NOTE : Recent current use inhale steroid exclusionary . If subject prescribe brief course oral corticosteroid , use limit less 7 day . Use steroids apheresis immune assessment blood draw discourage affect white blood cell function . Active infection HIV , HBV HCV Receipt experimental vaccine within 2 month opinion Investigator respond experimental vaccine give within 6 month , receive previous gene therapy use integrate vector History severe autoimmune disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment Lack availability patient immunological clinical followup assessment Evidence history significant cardiac disease</criteria>
