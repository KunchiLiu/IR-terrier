	<brief_summary>The underlying hypothesis synergistic activity octreotide everolimus base combination ) direct action everolimus mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) , b ) inhibitory effect octreotide IGF-I ( insulin like growth factor 1 ) system prevent activation mTOR system factor . Both type inhibition would completely cancel signal transduction pathway , important neuroendocrine tumour . Furthermore , biological study propose protocol allow good establish relationship activation IGFR-PI3K-mTOR signal transduction pathway ( i.e. , mTOR pathway stimulate IGFR ) treatment response ; information relevant since IGFR-PI3K-mTOR activation status could response prediction factor . This study provide significant additional information efficacy combination treatment everolimus octreotide LARÂ® non-functioning GI NET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Everolimus Combined With Octreotide LAR Treat Advanced GI NET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus develop follow two administration regimen : weekly daily . Phase I pharmacodynamic study recommend dose 50 mg weekly 10 mg/daily , base toxicity inhibitory effect mTOR pathway tumour ; although inhibition pathway demonstrate , knowledge response prediction factor develop , part due low response find population phase I study . These factor better outline phase II study , patient receive few previous treatment respond well , profile responder non-responders identify easily .</detailed_description>

Confirmation diagnosis neuroendocrine carcinoma low intermediate histology grade Radiologically document disease progression within 12 month prior inclusion study . If patient receive anticancer treatment within past 12 month , disease progression must document radiology take medication Adequate bone marrow . liver renal function Previous treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus , deforolimus ) .
