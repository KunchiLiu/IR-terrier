	<brief_summary>The study assess regression yellow plaque content lipid pool aggressive lipid therapy utilize NIR spectroscopy . Statin therapy use Rosuvastatin 10-40 mg compare statin therapy either Atorvastatin Simvastatin . This single site study . A total 100 subject randomize , 40 receive intensive lipid therapy ( Rosuvastatin 40mg ) 40 receive standard care lipid lower therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CHD ) remain leading cause death country ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . It well known reduce cholesterol level statin therapy associate significant reduction plaque burden . REVERSAL ( 3 ) ASTEROID ( 4 ) trial show patient coronary artery disease lipid-lowering atorvastatin rosuvastatin respectively reduce progression coronary atherosclerosis even cause repression lesion . CHD clinical event related plaque instability due lipid content within atherosclerotic plaque . High dose atorvastatin show reduce plaque lipid content serial IVUS analysis 12 month . Therefore reduction lipid content thereby plaque burden lipid lower therapy may stabilize plaque reduce cardiovascular event . High sensitivity C-reactive Protein ( HsCRP ) inflammatory biomarker independently predict future vascular event . In JUPITER ( 5 ) trial rosuvastatin ( Crestor ) significantly reduce incidence major cardiovascular event apparently healthy people elevate HsCRP . IVUS utilized demonstrate change coronary artery vessel wall morphology relatively short period time , provide data lipid content vessel wall . The application NIR spectroscopy identify lipid deposition within coronary artery validate ex vivo study . Infrared spectra collect follow : Light discrete wavelength laser direct onto tissue sample via glass fiber . Light scatter sample collect fiber launch spectrometer . The plot signal intensity function wavelength use develop chemometric model discriminate lipid-cores non-atherosclerotic tissue , atherosclerotic tissue predominantly fibrotic blood element .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient &gt; 18 year age willing participate Stable patient undergo cardiac catheterization PCI ( intent stent ) Patient willing go cholesterol lower medication duration study willing change statin therapy randomize statin therapy regardless previous statin therapy dose ( e.g . Atorvastatin 80 mg ) Patients screen study receive another Statin Pravachol require willing change therapy Rosuvastatin per randomization . If patient receive another statin , pravachol , agent , appropriate Lipid level , permit continue therapy ( randomized standard therapy arm ) .
