	<criteria>Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Patients must histologically confirm malignancy . Patient 's tumor type must appropriate therapy pemetrexed standard treatment approach . Patients must discontinue previous chemotherapy and/or radiation least 3 week [ six week nitrosoureas , BCNU , mitomycin C ] prior entry study recover toxic effect previous treatment . Pallative radiation therapy sit involve 2 week prior enrollment study . Age great 18 year . ECOG performance status le 2 [ see Appendix A ] . Patients able take oral medication . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great 1,500/mcL platelet great 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST [ SGOT ] /ALT [ SGPT ] le 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect OSI906 develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception [ hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ] prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients untreated , active symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . History allergic reaction OSI906 pemetrexed . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit adherence study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study OSI906 pemetrexed antiproliferative agent agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother OSI906 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated OSI906 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction OSI906 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients QTc interval great 450 msec baseline exclude due risk QTc prolongation OSI906 . Patients take medication prolong QTc interval exclude . Patients significant cardiac disease exclude . Patients fast blood glucose great 150 mg/dL baseline exclude due risk hyperglycemia OSI906 . Use drug know risk cause Torsades de Pointes [ TdP ] [ Torsades List www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/bycategory.cfm , see Appendix D ] prohibit within 14 day prior randomization . Use potent CYP1A2 inhibitor ciprofloxacin fluvoxamine . Other less potent CYP1A2 inhibitors/inducers exclude . Patients history poorly control gastrointestinal disorder could affect absorption study drug ( eg , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , etc ) exclude .</criteria>
