	<brief_title>Alisertib Combination With Vorinostat Treating Patients With Relapsed Recurrent Hodgkin Lymphoma , B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) MLN8237 ( alisertib ) give combination vorinostat select dose schedule test ( recommended Phase 2 dose : RP2D ) patient lymphoid malignancy . II . To describe toxicity MLN8237 give combination vorinostat 21-day schedule . III . To determine clinical response MLN8237 combination vorinostat . IV . To compare plasma pharmacokinetics MLN8237 give alone combination vorinostat . V. To perform immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis determine aurora kinase A ( AURKA ) expression archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded section recent available tumor specimens patient . VI . To perform correlative study apoptosis proliferation bone marrow lymph node specimen , available , obtained patient expand cohort RP2D . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 day 1-3 8-10 , vorinostat PO BID day 1-14 day 1-5 8-12 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
