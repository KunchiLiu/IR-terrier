	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) harmful effect morbidity mortality cancer patient . In Western VTE guideline , solid cancer patient receive abdominal major surgery strongly recommend receive pharmacologic prophylactic anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) perioperative period . These recommendation base high incidence postoperative VTE development Western cancer patient . However , many cumulative data effect different ethnicity VTE development investigator clinicians admit Asian ethnicity lower incidence VTE Western ethnicity . Therefore , may advisable apply Western guideline clinical situation Asian cancer patient . Although colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one common cancer incidence rapidly increase Asia , prospective data incidence VTE development postoperative period Asian CRC patient . To knowledge , small-sized prospective study Asia thus clear conclusion could draw base study . Most Korean colorectal surgeon think incidence postoperative VTE development rare base clinical experience . They also much concern complication bleed might cause routine use pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis perioperative period . Therefore , clinical situation , many Korean colorectal surgeon perform perioperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis use LMHW . Considering clinical situation Asia include Korea , uncritical acceptance Western guideline may inappropriate . The necessity pharmacologic thrombo-prophylaxis answer prospective study incidence postoperative VTE development CRC surgery . Moreover , current surgical trend cancer patient minimally invasive approach laparoscopic surgery . However , necessity pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis patient receive laparoscopic cancer surgery evaluate even Western country . Western guideline also exactly answer whether pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis really necessary cancer patient receive laparoscopic cancer surgery . On background , study design .</brief_summary>
