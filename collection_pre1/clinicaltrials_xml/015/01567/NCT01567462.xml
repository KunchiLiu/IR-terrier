	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare use two type equipment transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) . The two type surgical device : monopolar loop electrocautery PlasmaKinetic ( PK ) Button Vaporization Electrode . These two device task differ way create electric current remove cancerous tissue . The investigator hope examine compare use two surgical device see advantage exist whether actually similar . The goal study prove similarity outcomes two technique analyze outcomes result case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study study medical intervention use bladder cancer patient present new recurrent bladder tumor . Currently patient report tumor , undergo standard practice call transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) order determine stage cancer . This intervention , accomplish look urethra use endoscope , diagnostic potentially therapeutic . An adequately perform TURBT provide pathologist enough tissue provide tumor grade stage information . Currently , TURBT do use equipment call monopolar electrocautery form 90-degree loop electrode . Although usually safe sufficient , technique create technical challenge difficult position loop electrode dynamically change cylindrical space ( bladder ) . Specifically , especially large bladder tumor , intraoperative bleeding obscure visualization result incomplete tumor resection well inadequate sample layer bladder need establish tumor stage . Furthermore , monopolar current result stimulation nerve ( obturator nerve ) resection wall tumor , result violent movement leg cause potential bladder tear well possible ( iliac ) vessel injury . Conversely , technique use bipolar energy , available many year , readily adopt surgical treatment benign prostatic enlargement . The advantage bipolar electrical current include direct return electrical current loop rather ground pad place patient 's skin . This theoretical value limit diffusion electrical current , therefore heat , surround tissue . A refinement bipolar energy recent introduction piece equipment call PlasmaKinetic ( PK ) Button Vaporization electrode , currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) indication . Coupling bipolar energy Button electrode would harness benefit less thermal spread also would obviate geometric challenge associate loop electrode resection bladder tumor . Procedural advantage would potentially include minimal bleeding , good visualization , reduction occurrence obturator reflex concomitant bladder perforation . This study randomize double-arm trial examine result technique bladder cancer TURBT procedures minimum 120 patient Emory . The purpose study measure procedural ( intraoperative ) , short term , clinically indicate ( 4-6 week ) , long-term ( 3 month ) outcomes TURBT use PK Button compare traditional monopolar loop electrocautery . The goal study prove equivalence outcomes two technique .</detailed_description>
