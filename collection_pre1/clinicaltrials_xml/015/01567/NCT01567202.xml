	<brief_summary>This Phase II study single center determine efficacy autologous dendritic cell ( DCs ) load autogeneic glioma stem-like cell ( A2B5+ ) administer vaccination adult glioblastoma multiforme ( primary secondary ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study DC Vaccination Against Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance diagnosis treatment ( surgery +radiation +chemotherapy ) , median survival patient newly diagnose brain glioblastoma multiform ( GBM ) one year , recurrent GBM 4 month . Recently , immunotherapy emerge novel treatment strategy glioma improve patient survival . Usually , process tumor antigens patient 's tumor peptide vaccine capable produce anti-glioma response . Our previous experiment reveal CD133+ tumor stem-like cell associate antigen could elicit highly intensive immune response human malignant glioma , phase I study , confirm DC vaccine load glioma stem-like cell associate antigen malignant glioma recurrent patient safety . Autologous DCs obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) patient . Stem-like cell associate antigen ( SAA ) prepare glioma stem-like cell harvest patient GBM primary culture sort flowcytometrically irradiate . Approximately 4 week require vaccine production first vaccine administration . Each patient receive injection DCs his/her assign dose every week first 6 week . The dose DCs define 8~10×10^6 . Clinical trial utilize DCs immunotherapy demonstrate significant survival benefit patient exhibit robust immune response tumor cell . Unfortunately , present time majority clinical trial phase I illustrate safety . The efficacy DCs glioblastoma still lack sufficient randomize phase II study . According previous phase I study , design clinical trial triple-blind randomize manner validate efficacy DCs vaccination . Recently , order re-estimate sample size examine efficacy DC vaccine . interim analysis perform independent data monitoring committee , analysis contain : 11 case placebo group 11 case control group . According interim result : 86 % patient achieve primary endpoint event minimal adverse event . However , preliminary data unreliable conclude anything effency DC vaccine : variability need include analysis balance two group , immune response , residual tumor volume , molecular subtype GBM . Accordingly , make modification original plan , currently recruit new participant .</detailed_description>
