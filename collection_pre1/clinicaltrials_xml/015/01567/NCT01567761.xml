	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether intraocular pressure operate people general anesthesia affect artificial respiration method . If proven influence , finding may lead select best method patient increase intraocular pressure . In study , investigator monitor change observe intraocular pressure cause operation two different artificial respiration method : 1 . Intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( IPPV ) 2 . High frequency jet ventilation ( HFJV ) Study recruit 50 patient age 18 - 40 , candidate elective orthopedic surgery limb . These patient suffer general disease restrict daily function . The selection type surgery do prevent involvement factor , except respiration method , determination intraocular pressure . Exclusion Criteria : - Patients unable provide Informed Consent - Patients suffer eye disease - Patients corneal thickness less 450 micron 600 micron - Smokers - Patients pulmonary disease restrictive obstructive - Patients use bronchodilator All patient operate general anesthesia use total intravenous anesthesia ) TIVA ) method . All patient resuscitate half time surgery use IPPV , second half surgery use HFJV . During surgery IOP measure ophthalmologist unaware respiration method . Correction make intraocular pressure value , depend thickness cornea . The result measurement collect clinical significance review acceptable statistical method .</brief_summary>
