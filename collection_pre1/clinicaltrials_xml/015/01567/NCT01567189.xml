	<brief_title>Cost-effectiveness Outpatient Versus Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main reason patient participate cardiac rehabilitation program usually develop group hospital gym , problem access hospital , disgust participate group activity problem reconcile work / home program schedule .

Low medium coronary patient send cardiac rehabilitation program center within first 12 week present acute coronary syndrome revascularized include study . The prescription intensity effort base heart rate reach stress test initial evaluation case , although home-program heart rate monitor use heart rate monitor / Borg scale . In way outpatient group patient could perform train session individually time day best suit capability . The program component : control risk factor , health education counsel identical group patient .</detailed_description>
