	<brief_summary>The use antipsychotic medication increase past decade . While recently develop medication improve regard extrapyramidal side effect , use atypical antipsychotic associate substantial weight gain worsen metabolic profile . The time course extent weight gain differs among antipsychotic , olanzapine clozapine associate great weight gain . Mechanisms underlie worsen metabolic profile , obesity obesity-related illness complex , extend beyond sedentary lifestyle , poor diet genetic predisposition . There also grow body evidence sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) role generation obesity obesity-related illness . While role SNS blood pressure control readily acknowledge less well appreciated activation SNS exert profound metabolic effect . Although fact causal relation link antipsychotic drug obesity unequivocally establish , biological mechanism operate unclear , strategy preventive therapy remain largely unformulated . This study aim investigate role SNS association metabolic abnormality frequently observe patient schizophrenia follow treatment antipsychotic medication . Additionally , study investigate whether treatment centrally act sympatholytic agent moxonidine modify SNS activity , hence , favourably influence downstream metabolic abnormality see antipsychotic treated patient schizophrenia . Hypothesis 1 : Elevated sympathetic nervous system activity underlie metabolic disturbance observe patient follow antipsychotic therapy . Aim 1 : To investigate role sympathetic nervous system association metabolic abnormality frequently observe patient schizophrenia follow treatment antipsychotic medication Hypothesis 2 : Central sympathoinhibition moxonidine blunt elevate sympathetic nervous activity downstream metabolic abnormality observe antipsychotic treated patient schizophrenia . Aim 2 : Determine whether treatment centrally act sympatholytic agent moxonidine modify sympathetic nervous system activity , hence , favourably influence downstream metabolic abnormality see antipsychotic treated patient schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
