	<brief_summary>In Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , malaria important cause morbidity mortality . It estimate malaria responsible 30 % admission hospital average throughout country 25-30 % mortality child five . In 2005 , DRC adopt artesunate amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) first-line anti-malarial treatment . As WHO recommend efficacy antimalarial drug monitor regularly avoid upsurge mortality morbidity due continue use ineffective drug , randomize , non-inferiority open-label trial conduct Katanga , order compare efficacy fixed-dose formulation ASAQ versus artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) , Children age six 59 month uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria enrolledand randomly allocate one two regimen . The risk recurrent parasitaemia day 42 , unadjusted adjust PCR genotyping distinguish recrudescence new infection , analyse . Between April 2008 March 2009 , 301 childrenwere include : 156 ASAQ 145 AL . No early treatment failure report . Among 256 patient followed-up day 42 , 32 patient develop late clinical parasitological failure ( 9.9 % ( 13/131 ) ASAQ group 15.2 % ( 19/125 ) AL group ) . After PCR correction , cure rate 98.3 % ( 95 % CI , 94.1-99.8 ) ASAQ group 99.1 % ( 95 % CI , 94.9-99.9 ) AL group ( difference -0.7 % , one side 95 % CI -3.1 ) . Kaplan-Meier PCR-adjusted cure rate similar . Both treatment regimens generally well tolerate . Both ASAQ AL highly effective currently adequate first-line treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria area Katanga , DRC . However , large country DRC , possible emergence resistance endemic region , surveillance efficacy artemisinin-based combination treatment , include evaluation resistance ASAQ , need do province .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Amodiaquine-Artesunate Artemether-Lumefantrine Treatment Uncomplicated Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design site An open randomized study conduct test hypothesis risk recurrent parasitaemia 42 day inferior group receive artesunate amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) regimen compare group receive artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) regimen . The patient recruit outpatient department general reference hospital Pweto , health district Pweto , province Katanga , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , April 2008 March 2009 . Procedures Children age six 59 month body weight ≥ 5kg eligible enrolment P. falciparum infection ( density threshold inclusion 2,000 200,000/µl ) , fever history fever previous 24 hour , sign severe malaria , report hypersensitivity study drug , serious concomitant febrile illness . The child include randomized one two treatment arm , 1:1 ratio without stratification . The randomization list generate computer block six . Treatment allocation keep seal numbered opaque envelope . Participants enrol order diagnose . ASAQ ( ASAQ Winthrop® , Sanofi-Aventis ) administer daily three day , follow : one tablet artesunate 25mg/amodiaquine 67.5 mg child 5 8.9 kg , artesunate 50mg/amodiaquine 135 mg child 9 17.9 kg . One tablet artemether 20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg ; ( Coartem® Novartis Pharma , Basel , Switzerland ) administer twice daily three day child body weight 5 14.9 kg two tablet administer twice daily three day child body weight 15 24.9 kg . All dose drug administer direct observation three day . Full dose drug re-administered patient vomit within 30 min receipt . Patients vomit twice exclude study . Signs severe malaria serious health condition ( i.e . severe malnutrition ) , intake anti-malarial treatment last seven day , mixed malaria infection also exclusion criterion . Clinical assessment ( include measurement axillary temperature ) , tick thin smear haemoglobin measurement perform day 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 42 day event illness . Malaria outcome classification Outcomes classify accord 2009 WHO guideline adequate clinical parasitological response ( ACPR ) , early treatment failure ( ETF ) , late clinical failure ( LCF ) , late parasitological failure ( LPF ) follow-up interrupt . Follow-up interrupt include treatment protocol violation , lose follow-up , use anti-malarials ( quinine ) outside study protocol withdrawal consent prohibit follow-up . Drug tolerability also assess clinically . An adverse event define undesirable symptom patient study regardless whether related treatment . PCR genotyping In area intense transmission , multiple genotype infection common , second episode malaria recurrent parasitaemia drug-free follow-up period may due infection different infection ( recrudescence , thus treatment failure , new infection , respectively ) . To distinguish two event , polymorphic P. falciparum gene , merozoite surface protein 1 2 gene ( msp1 msp2 ) glutamate-rich protein gene ( glurp ) genotyped PCR , previously describe . PCR analyse , conduct Epicentre research base , Mbarara , Uganda , perform use paired sample patient experience late clinical parasitologic failure . Blood collect filter paper ( Whatman FTA® Cards ) day enrollment day treatment failure occur . The genotypic profile pre- post-treatment parasite compare ; patient pre- post-treatment genotype identical consider recrudescence patient pre- post-treatment genotype different consider new infection . All ETFs consider due recrudescence . Patients meet criterion LCF LPF genotyping do ; accord result , patient classify either ( ) resolve PCR categorize recrudescence new infection ( ii ) unsuccessfully genotyped reason record ( miss sample , PCR do result inconclusive ) . Statistical analysis The primary outcome PCR-adjusted parasitological cure rate day 42 follow-up period . Two analytical approach use assess efficacy data . First per protocol ( PP ) analysis perform include patient follow throughout protocol , define follow-up period clear treatment outcome determine . The risk failure treatment group calculate proportion patient classified failure ( numerator ) divide number patient evaluable population ( denominator ) . In second approach , survival analysis perform patient incomplete follow-up reach primary outcome interest include analysis non-failures , censor last day follow-up . The risk failure calculate use Kaplan-Meier product limit formula data censor patient classified failure interrupt follow-up . Patients wrongly include , meet study inclusion criterion , exclude analysis . In PP analysis ( adjust genotyping ) , evaluable population include patient classified ACPR , ETF LCF/LPF due recrudescence . In survival analysis , evaluable population adjust unadjusted calculation include patient enrol study , exception LCF/LPF outcomes unsuccessful genotyping outcome exclude adjusted calculation . For unadjusted calculation , patient follow-up interrupted non-falciparum new infection censor last day observation . For adjusted calculation , censor patient also include new P. falciparum infection . Other variable , baseline characteristic patient two treatment arm , compare use chi2 test Fisher 's exact test variable Student 's test continuous variable . Data double enter validated use Epidata version 3.1 ( Odense , Danemark ) . All analysis perform Stata , version 10 ( Stats-Corp , College Station , Texas ) . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
