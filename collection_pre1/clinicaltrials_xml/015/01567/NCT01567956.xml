	<brief_summary>The aim trial test safety , tolerability efficacy Propionyl-L-carnitine modify release tablet 1g/die reduce symptom disease respect proportion patient disease remission end 8 week treatment . It also aim investigate capability treatment maintenance remission four week treatment interruption ; histological change also evaluate finally , improvement overall quality life measure Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride Patients With Mild Ulcerative Colitis ; Efficacy , Safety Tolerability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although seem clear abnormal function colonic epithelium central problem cause inflammation unusual immunological response normal gut flora inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , actual cause dysfunction still unknown . Short Chain Fatty Acids ( SCFA ) main fuel colonic epithelium , normally produce bacterial flora fermentation complex carbohydrate form non soluble fiber usually introduce everyday diet . Butyrate alone contribute 70 % normal colonocyte energy . Studies do use animal model colonic mucosa biopsy patient suffer form ulcerative colitis ( UC ) consistently show metabolic change occur diseased colonic mucosa , impairment butyrate oxidation ( beta-oxidation ) energy shortage incompletely compensated oxidation glucose substrate glutamine . It also well know matrix metalloproteases production highly increase IBD serum transglutaminase activity significantly reduce patient IBD . Transglutaminases enzymes contribute crosslinking matrix protein reduction see patient affect IBD correlate well endoscopic histopathologic grade UC , mean part circulate enzyme sequester injured colonic tissue effort re-build extracellular matrix heal process . Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( PLC ) molecule already show reduce membrane lipid peroxidation endothelial cell bovine aorta coronary vessel , reduce effect hypoxia coronary endothelial cell , play role cardiac metabolic abnormality contribute mechanical dysfunction lead heart failure . Given property Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( ST 261 ) give peroxidative damage suffer colonocytes UC together metabolic impairment , use molecule treatment UC seem appropriate sound , particular carrier propionate moiety , transformed succinate , enters Kreb cycle , act extra burst fuel improve balance energy production inside tissue . Previous clinical experience show PLC promote complete nearly complete regression cutaneous trophic ulcer large number vasculopathic patient refractory therapy . As far UC pathology concern , effect ST 261 , give orally intrarectally , investigate different dosage , preclinical experimentation , either single trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS ) administration ( acute colitis ) repeat TNBS administration ( reactivate colitis ) . The result show reduction damage colon area acute model reactivate colitis , even beneficial effect restoration TNBS-induced alteration tissue morphology evident reactivate colitis model , particularly oral administration . Based above-described result development plan human start investigate activity PLC treatment ulcerative colitis .</detailed_description>
