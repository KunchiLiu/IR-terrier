	<detailed_description>Central aortic blood pressure ( BP ) flow generally informative cardiac dynamic global circulation compare cardiovascular parameter measure periphery [ 1,2 ] . However , clinical impact limit due significant clinical risk substantial cost associate measurement . Peripheral arterial BP 's easily obtain non-invasively , serve direct substitute central aortic BP due distortion arterial BP waveform cause pressure wave propagation reflection . Recently , two innovative model-based method , `` Individualized Transfer Functions ( ITF ) , '' develop Dr. Hahn estimate central aortic BP waveform use measurement peripheral BP waveform ( ) [ 3-6 ] . These technique validate animal simulated human subject . The objective propose research project 1 ) examine feasibility validity innovative method human subject , 2 ) compare performance method direct peripheral BP exist non-individualized ( NITF ) method . The propose research project consist two major part : 1 ) collection central aortic peripheral BP data , 2 ) evaluation ITF method use data . BP data collect patient already undergoing procedure cardiopulmonary bypass . Central aortic , radial femoral BP waveform simultaneously record . A non-invasive finger BP waveform also record . The pair radial-femoral finger-femoral BP recording analyze two-measurement ITF [ 3-5 ] estimate individual-specific central aortic BP waveform . In addition , radial finger BP record analyze single-measurement ITF [ 6 ] estimate individual-specific central aortic BP waveform . The feasibility validity method human subject assess compare estimate central aortic BP waveform measure central aortic BP waveform . Its relative performance respect direct peripheral BP exist NITF method analyze compare difference measure central aortic versus ITF-derived central aortic BP waveform measure central aortic versus direct peripheral NITF-derived central aortic BP waveform . Cardiovascular disease account 1/3 deaths $ 22 billion healthcare-related cost Canada every year [ 7 ] . The propose research project make significant contribution improve clinical care use ITF detection diagnostics cardiovascular disease . In fact , propose research project key initial step towards long-term research objective non-invasive cardiovascular disease diagnostics . The success propose research project milestone demonstrate ITF serve minimally invasive and/or non-invasive approach whose individually estimate central aortic BP waveform cardiovascular system model exploit detection diagnostics number cardiovascular disease , e.g . aortic valve impairment peripheral arterial disease , virtue diagnostically relevant health disease condition central peripheral arterial vessel ITF deliver .</detailed_description>
