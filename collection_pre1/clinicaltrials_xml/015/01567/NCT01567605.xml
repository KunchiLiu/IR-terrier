	<brief_summary>The main goal project determine effect lidocaine lubricant cardiovascular function routine bowel care individual spinal cord injury . Bowel care common trigger blood pressure heart rate change spinal cord injury . In project , measure blood pressure heart rate non-invasively normal bowel routine ( perform subject 's home one investigator facility ) . The measurement occur twice period 28 day : use lidocaine lubricant use normal ( placebo ) lubricant . The recording equipment attach subject complete privacy bowel routine . The trial double-blind , mean neither subject Nurse Continence Advisor assist test know lubricant use test . The use lubricant gel contain anesthetic standard care many hospital facility perform bowel care individual spinal cord injury ; however , often use home setting . It think use anaesthetic might reduce cardiovascular effect bowel care spinal cord injury . However , know whether case . The investigator hypothesize lidocaine lubricant alleviate blood pressure heart rate change occur bowel care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study investigate effect topical anesthesia cardiovascular change trigger bowel care people spinal cord injury . In people spinal cord injury , episodes high blood pressure common strong sensory stimulus present routine bowel care . These episode high blood pressure dangerous due magnitude blood pressure increase accompany irregular heart beat . This condition , know autonomic dysreflexia , common individual high-level injury . The experience autonomic dysreflexia vary widely individual : goosebump , sweat , facial flushing headache , others symptom , despite change heart rate blood pressure . The use lubricant gel contain anesthetic , lidocaine lubricant , standard care many hospital facility perform bowel care individual spinal cord injury ; however , often use home setting . It think use anaesthetic might reduce cardiovascular effect bowel care spinal cord injury . However , know whether case . We yet know long-term consequence short-term elevation blood pressure autonomic dysreflexia , give often associate discomfort , know associate severe event stroke , would beneficial reduce occurrence . Therefore , test whether lidocaine lubricant compare placebo lubricant improve symptom sign autonomic dysreflexia bowel care people spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
