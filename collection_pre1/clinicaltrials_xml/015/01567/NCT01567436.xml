	<brief_title>A Prospective Field Study : Introducing Shang Ring Routine Clinical Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization , Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , global reproductive health organization recognize highly protective effect male circumcision prevent HIV infection men . Male Circumcision ( MC ) new biomedical method demonstrate consistent efficacy HIV prevention intervention randomize controlled trial , base three randomize control trial Kenya , Uganda , South Africa , report protective effect 60 % . Subsequent study confirm value persistence MC 's protection HIV infection , demonstrate MC also reduce transmission human papillomavirus . A wide variety instrument , device , technique use around world male circumcision . The WHO , UNAIDS JHPIEGO document entitle Manual Male Circumcision Local Anesthesia , include step-by-step instruction perform adult male circumcision use three different surgical procedure : forceps-guided , dorsal slit , sleeve resection method . Procedure time technique approximately 20-30 minute exclude anesthesia involve control unavoidable bleed significant amount suturing , associate complication include hematoma formation , infection , unsatisfactory cosmetic result , laceration penile scrotal skin injury glans , particularly among inexperienced surgeon . Although training necessary regardless method , device MC potential reduce training time surgical duration neither hemostasis suturing need device . The Shang Ring innovative device adult male circumcision Chinese market since 2005 . The Shang Ring manufacture Wuhu SNNDA Medical Treatment Appliance Technology Co. , Ltd ( SNNDA ) . In current African setting , surgical circumcision available adult . Devices Shang Ring potential simplify shorten surgery eliminate need suture hemostasis . Data two small study Kenya suggest Shang Ring acceptable safety profile . A randomized control trial conduct Kenya Zambia provide data . Circumcision use Shang Ring involve simple step . First , special measuring strip use determine Shang Ring size use . Following administration local anesthesia , inner ring fit base glans penis . Next , foreskin evert inner ring outer ring secure ( lock ) inner ring , thus encase foreskin . The sterile device form tight seal . The foreskin excise several nick make foreskin underside device prevent formation stiff , circumferential scab . Bleeding minimal suture hemostasis require . Finally , participant return seven day removal Shang Ring device . After removal , bandage apply wound . Men may give supply bandage tell change bandage daily need .</detailed_description>
