	<brief_summary>While significant progress make medical imagery recent year individualization different lesion nervous system demyelination , axonal loss , atrophy , little progress make specific recognition inflammatory process . Yet point essential since currently available treatment partial impact mainly inflammatory component many uncertainty remain links inflammation tissue destruction affect myelin axon . The recent discovery macrophage cell marker CNS , specific ( USPIO ) inflammation give u opportunity answer important question one sense could significant impact therapeutic drug monitoring patient . This study involve 50 patient recruit five French center ( Marseille , Paris , Reims , Rennes , Toulouse ) early manifestation disease clinical MRI schedule first 3 year disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system affect 60.000 person France characterize widespread inflammation , focal demyelination , variable degree axonal loss . In recent year concept MS inflammatory neurodegenerative disease corroborate neuropathologic vivo MR imaging study . A number MR study show principal pathological substrate permanent disability axonal loss detect MR study global atrophy , also regionally white grey matter , atrophy already occur early stage disease . Though MR image powerful tool MS term diagnosis , description natural history disease treatment monitoring , major drawback MRI MS lack specificity MR finding . Furthermore , advent disease modify drug , need robust specific MR marker identify e.g . clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) patient presentation high risk develop MS severe disease course . An increase body MRI evidence corroborates CIS show early dynamic change detect MR imaging , global regional brain atrophy , sign progressive axonal loss , atrophy already late stage sign disease , tissue lose . Considerable effort spend today identify early prognostic MR marker high risk CIS patient . In current project endeavour study CIS patient inflammatory disease central nervous system early clinical deficit use cell label MR image ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide particle ( USPIO ) , specifically label blood-borne macrophage , key cell population MS. We hypothesise number/volume USPIO ( SH U 555 C ) enhancement first year predictive marker high risk CIS patient presentation . This hypothesis line recent finding animal model MS , EAE . Secondary measure study include comparison USPIO ( SH U 555 C ) find highly sensitive , non-specific MR parameter .</detailed_description>
