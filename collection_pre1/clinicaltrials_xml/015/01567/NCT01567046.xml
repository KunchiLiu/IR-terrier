	<brief_title>Studying Genes Tissue Samples From Younger Adolescent Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Subtype : Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model : Cohort Time Perspective : Retrospective Biospecimen Retention : Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description : Tissue Study Population Description : Existing NRSTS sample COG D9902/ARST0332 study Sampling Method : Non-Probability Sample OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency actionable mutation find archive non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( NRSTS ) tumor specimen use mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . OUTLINE : Archived DNA tissue sample analyze frequency genetic mutation , include single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , single nucleotide variant ( SNVs ) , small deletion and/or insertion , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) mass spectometry ( Sequenom MassARRAY ) . Results analyze determine whether specific mutation correlate patient disease feature tumor stage , histological grade , outcome .</detailed_description>
