	<brief_summary>This study open label , multicenter study two phase : - Phase I dose escalation study RAD001 combination one injection Rituximab 375 mg/m² per week 4 week ( 28 day ) patient CD20 positive non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas determine dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The purpose study assess feasibility combination base - rate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) PK drug-drug interaction ( DDI ) . - Phase II define efficacy safety profile RAD001 Rituximab combination RP2D patient lymphomas . Patients lymphomas treat RP2D establish phase I evaluate clinical benefit rate , comprise complete response ( CR + CRu ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) , time progression use IWG criterion treatment response . Induction therapy follow schedule phase I study . Maintenance therapy : Monthly cycle 2 year : - Daily RAD001 dose induction therapy . - Rituximab infusion every cycle 375 mg/m2 correspond usual maintenance schedule Rituximab . Response therapy assess day 42 day 49 , every two month .</brief_summary>

The presence alopecia NCICTC grade &lt; 2 symptomatic peripheral neuropathy allow . Age ≥18 year old ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 ; Adequate liver renal function , define total bilirubin ≤2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ≤5 x ULN liver involve malignancy judge investigator ( explanation must provide ) creatinine ≤ 221 μmol/L ; Fasting serum cholesterol ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Adequate bone marrow function , define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/mm3 platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 , unless due disease ; At least 3 week since previous chemotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy , major surgery , investigational cancer therapy consider diseasedirected recovered prior toxicity Grade 01 ; All men reproductive potential women† childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree practice effective contraception entire study period one month last study treatment , unless documentation infertility exist . † A woman patient consider childbearing potential unless meet least one follow criterion 1 ) Age &gt; 50 year naturally amenorrhoeic &gt; 1 year ( amenorrhoea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) ; 2 ) Premature ovarian failure confirm specialist gynaecologist 3 ) Previous bilateral salpingooophorectomy , hysterectomy , 4 ) XY genotype , turner syndrome , uterine agenesis . Able understand willingness sign inform consent form . Uncontrolled clinically significant intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients receive antibiotic infection control may include study ; Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid ( dose equivalent great 20 mg prednisone per day ) another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus .
