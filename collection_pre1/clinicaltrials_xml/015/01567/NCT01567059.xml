	<brief_summary>This study examine new oral chemotherapy drug call tosedostat , combination cytarabine decitabine . Tosedostat think work decrease availability amino acid ( build block cell need make protein ) cell . It show early study activity variety cancer , include leukemia . Patients acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) specific genetic mutation poorer response chemotherapy high risk relapse treatment . Researchers look see combination chemotherapy drug may improve outcome patient respond well current chemotherapy regimen , without increase risk treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tosedostat Combination With Cytarabine Decitabine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 4 month survival complete remission ( CR ) rate tosedostat combination either cytarabine decitabine untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability tosedostat combination either cytarabine decitabine . II . To determine treatment related mortality define death within first 30 day begin treatment . III . To estimate rate disease-free survival ( DFS ) 1 year overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive tosedostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-35 cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) day 1-5 . ARM II : Patients receive tosedostat PO QD day 1-35 decitabine IV day 1-5 . If patient develop significant increase circulate bone marrow blast count , subsequent cycle may start early day 21 current cycle . In arm , treatment repeat every 35 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR partial CR ( pCR ) may receive 2 additional course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
