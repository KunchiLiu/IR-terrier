	<brief_summary>Outpatient polyp treatment perform different way generally involve pass special type hysteroscope ( 3-6 millimetre diameter ) womb specifically design miniature operate instrument pass remove polyp ( ) . At present commonly use instrument use electrical cutting edge . However , new instrument use mechanical cut edge come market . In patient general anaesthesia mechanical cut instrument show easy learn , effective completely remove polyps quicker . However , instrument slightly large , could potentially cause discomfort prolong procedure outpatient set . Therefore , investigator want compare electrical mechanical instrument speed , completeness polyp removal patient acceptability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Morcellation With Electrical Resection Removal Uterine Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The miniaturisation hysteroscopes ancillary instrumentation couple enhanced visualisation enable hysteroscopic surgery perform outpatient set without need general anaesthesia inpatient hospital admission . The common operative hysteroscopic procedure endometrial polypectomy feasibility acceptability approach demonstrate . The procedure involve remove polyp uterine cavity . Over 90 % UK gynaecologists routinely recommend removal endometrial polyp follow diagnosis aim treat associate symptom abnormal bleed retrieve specimen exclude malignant pre-malignant disease . The investigator recently complete recruitment large , multicentre , randomise control trial call Outpatient Polypectomy Trial ( 'OPT ' http : //www.opt.bham.ac.uk , ISRCTN65868569 ) , compare treatment setting removal endometrial polyp . Over 500 woman randomise outpatient procedure day-case procedure require general anaesthetic . The analysis regard relative treatment effectiveness available late 2012 . Interestingly , trial also recruit woman express preference treatment set . This result additional 400 woman enter study 90 % preference outpatient setting ( Personal communication Clark TJ ) . Thus outpatient removal polyp , feasible , safe preferred woman . The majority gynaecologists perform outpatient procedure , cut polyps away attachment uterine wall use miniature bipolar electrosurgical instrument ; Versapoint® ( Gynecare ; Ethicon Inc. , New Jersey , USA ) . This procedure carry direct hysteroscopic vision , without need routine , potentially painful , dilatation cervix . Whilst technology feasible effective require skill experience outpatient hysteroscopic surgery , many UK gynaecologist lack reflect limited adoption outpatient procedure spite evidence support use . Moreover , even experience operator , retrieve remove polyp specimen uterine cavity , send histopathological assessment , challenge due small operating field need negotiate narrow endocervical canal . Various method use retrieve specimen include use mechanical instrument ( e.g . grasp forceps snare ) require cervix dilate . However , approach often fails fragility minute hysteroscopic instrument ( diameter 1.2-1.8mm ) recourse insertion large 'polyp ' forceps blindly uterine cavity necessary . The latter approach require use local injection anaesthetic cervix uncomfortable dilatation cervix potential uterine trauma . Since , completion recruitment OPT trial new technology become available call TRUCLEAR hysteroscopic morcellator ( Smith &amp; Nephew , Andover MASS , USA ) . This technology incorporate 4mm disposable mechanical cutting device simultaneously cut aspirate polyp tissue . The ability cut retrieve polyp avoids need additional instrumentation uterine cavity order retrieve detach polyp specimen i.e . single insertion hysteroscope require . The use mechanical morcellation may also improve visualisation surgery avoidance bubble formation production tissue fragment ( 'chips ' ) associate electrosurgical approach . Thus , new technology potential advantage patient ( acceptability , pain , infection , safety ) , surgeon ( speed , feasibility , completeness procedure ) health service ( avoidance second stage procedure general anaesthetic ) . However , establish single use bipolar electrode small disposable morcellator cut device ( 1.6mm vs. 2.9mm ) . Moreover , bipolar electrode use operate channel variety continuous flow hysteroscopes longer small diameter day-to-day use gynaecological practice outpatient setting ( out diameter 4.1mm ( Gynecare ; Ethicon Inc. , New Jersey , USA ) , 5mm Storz Bettocci hysteroscope ( Karl Storz Endoscopy-America inc. , California , USA ) Olympus 5.5mm ( Olympus Corporation , Shinjuku-ku , Tokyo , Japan ) . In contrast , hysteroscopic morcellator system large ( 5.6mm outer diameter ) require acquisition specific hysteroscopes offset proximal eyepiece allow rigid mechanical cut device insert direct alignment barrel hysteroscope . Thus outpatient setting , bipolar electrode may advantage large hysteroscopic morcellator term ease uterine instrumentation . In view development hysteroscopic morcellation potential advantage associate innovation hysteroscopic instrumentation , investigator believe urgent need undertake robust health technology assessment . It timely perform RCT finding OPT trial available ( recommend outpatient oppose day-case treatment increase cost-effectiveness demonstrate ) . If morcellator consider easy technology use gynaecologist ( i.e . le operator skill require ) , danger become widely adopt outpatient use without support evidence benefit .</detailed_description>
