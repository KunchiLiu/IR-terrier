	<brief_title>Different Feeding Methods After Pyloromyotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis common disease occur 2 per 1,000 live births1 . Pyloric stenosis hypertrophy pyloric muscle prevents empty stomach lead gastric outlet obstruction . The vomit ensues becomes projectile result severe dehydration . Traditionally repaired pyloromyotomy via transverse incision right upper quadrant . In last decade investigator start procedure laparoscopically . Most institution follow similar guideline constitutes hypertrophic pyloric channel , initial electrolyte management resuscitation prior surgery , well pyloromyotomy ( either open laparoscopically ) . Historically patient feed day surgery , 6 hour , currently investigator wait 2 hour surgery start feed . The investigator go protocol 2 round clear liquid , 2 round half strength formula/breast milk 2 round full strength . Some center advocate ad lib feed baby go straight full strength tolerate awake operation . Institutional variability even confound individual attending variability instance . Recent article past two decade still prove consensus found . Some institution profess Ad Libitum feed cost-effective well safe , institution knowledge follow mantra . Others demand feed start within 4 hour post surgery state increase vomit associate early feeding regimen actually prolongs time full feed due anxiety discomfort . What show matter whether patient start 4 hour post surgery wait 18 hour time full feed . All study hinder fact retrospective component design . What also propagate two recent retrospective review implementation clinical pathway well standardize feed regimen . Both show decrease length stay postoperatively well hospital cost . At institution clinical pathway feed regimen implement . The feed regimen contrary previously quote paper start 2 hour sequential feeding increase . A prospectively acquire dataset institution show emesis correlate degree dehydration child prior surgery even child clinical pathway . What study show u profession , Pediatric Surgery proper evidence support one post-op feed regimen .</detailed_description>
