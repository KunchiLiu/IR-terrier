	<brief_summary>This research study experimental ( investigational ) oral inactivated whole cell Shigella flexneri 2a kill vaccine ( Sf2aWC ) . Sf2aWC kill vaccine make prevent disease Shigella. , cause bloody , watery diarrhea . Infants child live develop country experience great consequence disease . The purpose study find dose vaccine safe , tolerable , develop immune response . About 82 healthy adult , age 18-45 , participate study . This study require volunteer stay research facility several night first dose . Participants Cohorts 2 , 3 , 4 require stay overnight second third dos . Participants assign receive 1 4 vaccine dos mouth . Study procedures include : stool sample , blood sample document side effect . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Inactivated Shigella Whole Cell Vaccine Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite public health burden Shigella spp . traveler , deploy soldier , significantly , young child develop world , licensed vaccine Shigella . The rationale use Shigella flexneri 2a whole cell kill vaccine ( Sf2aWC ) , expect especially well tolerated subject . If Sf2aWC safe immunogenic , may combine S. sonnei S. flexneri 3a basis multivalent vaccine , three component cover 80 % shigella infection develop country 90 % developed country . This single site , Phase 1 , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study healthy adult subject . Approximately 82 subject enrol four separate cohort randomize receive Sf2aWC placebo . The placebo preparation bicarbonate buffer . Cohort 1 subject receive single oral dose Sf2aWC ( 2.6Â±0.8 x 10^8 vp/mL ) placebo . Dosing 72 hour supervise post-vaccination safety follow-up conduct CIR Inpatient Unit . Before enrol subject subsequent cohort , safety data previous Cohort ( ) Study Day 7 evaluate review Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) . Cohorts 2 , 3 , 4 participant receive three dos Sf2aWC vaccine placebo 0 , 1 2 month . The first immunization administer CIR inpatient unit , follow 72 hour direct post-immunization observation . If review SRC first dose appear safe well tolerate , subsequent dos administer outpatient basis . Safety assess solicited symptoms/subject memory aid laboratory evaluation . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord standardize criterion . The immunogenicity outcome measure interest include serum IgG IgA antibodies ELISA S. flexneri 2a LPS S. flexneri 2a invasive protein antigen ( Ipa ) , cytokine assay , B T cell memory response , vaccine-specific IgA response . The propose sample size twenty per group Cohorts 2 , 3 , 4 would sufficient select appropriate dose move next study phase , provide difference immunogenicity two arm 20 % great . Participants include 82 healthy adult male female subject , age 18 45 inclusive . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability Sf2aWC vaccine administer three oral dos range dose level healthy adult subject . The secondary objective ass immunogenicity Sf2aWC vaccine range dose healthy adult subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult , male female , age 18 45 year ( inclusive ) time enrollment . Completion review comprehension test ( achieve &gt; 70 % accuracy ) . Signed informed consent form . Available required followup period schedule clinic visit . Negative urine pregnancy test vaccination female subject childbearing potential . Females childbearing potential must agree use efficacious hormonal barrier method birth control study . Abstinence also acceptable . Presence significant medical psychiatric condition opinion investigator precludes participation study . Some medical condition , adequately treat stable , would preclude entry study . These condition might include stable asthma , hypertension depression control medication . Clinically significant abnormality physical examination . Clinically significant abnormality screen hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis determine PI PI consultation Medical Monitor . History febrile illness within 48 hour prior vaccination . BMI &lt; 19 &gt; 34 . Positive blood test HBsAG , HCV , HIV1 , HLAB27 . Women currently nurse . History reactive arthritis . Evidence current excessive alcohol consumption Evidence current drug use drug dependence . Regular use antidiarrheal , anticonstipation , antacid therapy ( exclude use associate spicy meal ) . Abnormal stool pattern ( few 3 stool per week 3 stool per day ) regular basis ; loose liquid stool occasional basis . Personal family history inflammatory arthritis . History allergy soy product . History microbiologically confirm Shigella infection within 3 year . Prior receipt experimental Shigella vaccine live Shigella challenge within 3 year . Symptoms traveler ' diarrhea associate travel country Shigella enteric infection endemic ( develop world ) within 1 year prior dose . Occupation involve handle Shigella bacteria currently , past 3 year . History diarrhea 7 day vaccination . Use antibiotic 7 day vaccination . Use proton pump inhibitor , H2 blocker , antacid within 48 hour prior dose . Inability comply inpatient rule regulation . Use immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulative drug corticosteroid chemotherapeutics may influence antibody development . Participation research involve another investigational product ( defined receipt investigational product exposure invasive investigational device ) 30 day plan date first vaccination .</criteria>
