	<brief_title>The Effect Different Macronutrients Ileal Brake Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appearance food matrix duodenum , meal postprandial phase result feed-back different part intestine stomach , small intestine central nervous system . All process inhibit , concert , food processing gastrointestinal tract , satiation appetite sensation , consequently , food intake . These process involve so-called intestinal brake . The location feedback process initiate determines severity brake effect ; entry nutrient duodenum jejunum activates so-called duodenal jejunal `` brake '' : negative feedback mechanism influence function proximal part gastrointestinal tract . Activation feedback mechanism result reduction food intake inhibition hunger , probably partly inhibition gastric empty rate ( thus contribute enhance prolonged gastric distension ) small intestinal transit time . More distal small intestine , ileal brake feedback mechanism result inhibition proximal gastrointestinal motility secretion increase feeling satiation reduction ad libitum food intake.These result point potentially powerful role ileal brake regulation digestion , direct indirect impact upon eat behaviour satiation . The current scientific data strongly suggest activation ileal brake provide powerful feedback mechanism gastrointestinal transit , especially , satiety signal food intake . Most study use fat macronutrient . The effect several amount , type preparation fat ileal brake previously investigate report . Until present , effect macronutrients induce ileal brake remain largely unknown . There evidence carbohydrate induce ileal brake . Proteins may also exert effect , although data scarce convincing . However , becomes accepted protein may induce strong effect satiation food intake fat carbohydrate . In study 're go investigate effect intraileal infusion casein sucrose ileal brake activation .</detailed_description>
