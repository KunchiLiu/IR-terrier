	<brief_summary>Overall goal : To apply investigator ' well defined simple , few-minute breathing/ mild physical exercise program evaluate efficacy/benefits improvement clinico-immunological outcome obese patient asthma . Rationale &amp; Hypothesis : Different breathing exercise regimens currently recommend well define certain case may worsen dyspnea even trigger asthma attack . Therefore , important evaluate overall usefulness breathing exercise therapeutic intervention asthma . In regard , investigator design easy , few-minute breathing exercise program treatment modality asthma evaluate efficacy improve associate clinico-immunological symptom . The investigator hypothesize investigator ' well-designed breathing/mild physical exercise intervention obese patient help alleviate stress symptom asthma reduce chronic low-grade systemic inflammation thus potentiate beneficial outcome medication render good control disease improve quality life obese patient . Clinical relevance/Significance : The investigator expect exercise module help reduce inflammation cause asthma , thereby relieve symptom asthma . If successful , would allow regular individualized exercise module recommend part therapy people asthma , could possibly reduce dosage well frequency take medicine need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthmatics particularly obese major constraint impede regular physical activity exercise . Indeed , study resort option exercise asthmatic patient also recognize exacerbation associate symptom major limitation approach . Considering obstacle often involve , lack time motivation , inadequate social support lack access facility etc , therefore necessary design simple , feasible carefully tailor breathing exercise modality obese patient asthma , study impact improvement clinico-immunological parameter , lung function overall quality life . To end , investigator develop safe feasible light breathe exercise program individual asthma base previous observation . Study Aims &amp; Objectives : The investigator ' main goal apply well defined simple exercise program include physical breathing exercise lesson evaluate effect improvement clinico-immunological outcome obese patient asthma . There three main objective base clinic-immunological outcome . 1 . To assess improvement asthma control , lung function airways hyper-reactivity intervention . 2 . To test propose intervention result improvement pro-inflammatory profile . 3 . To determine physical psychological performance well health relate quality life positively impact propose exercise modality . About 200 individual asthma enrol study divide two group : The intervention group control . The intervention group receive standard asthma care along breathing/mild physical exercise . The control group asthmatic patient willing receive exercise intervention . At study entry , participant undergo clinical assessment include physical exam , asthma control/ quality life questionnaire , pulmonary function test , lung inflammation test ( Exhaled Nitric Oxide ) . To monitor participant throughout study , follow visit do 6 , 12 , 18 24 week start exercise . About 40 ml blood collect baseline ( pre-exercise ) two different time point ( 3 6 month post-exercise ) . The blood sample use pro-inflammatory profile . Duration study three year .</detailed_description>
