	<brief_summary>The main goal research understand neuronal mechanism mediate development spasticity motor dysfunction spinal cord injury . The investigator examine neuron neuronal circuit injure nervous system adapt produce uncontrolled unwanted muscle contraction affect majority ( 80 % ) patient spinal cord injury . One neuron investigator study motoneuron excites muscle limbs produce movement . Previously , investigator show spinal cord injury , excessive uncontrolled activity motoneuron muscle spasm mediate , large part , activation calcium current human motoneuron . In human patient investigator use recording single muscle fibre estimate contribution calcium current activate motoneuron muscle spasm . In proposal , investigator study motoneuron recover calcium current self-sustained activity chronic spinal cord injury . Because calcium current require presence monoamine serotonin ( 5HT ) activate , monoamine greatly reduced injury , investigator examine calcium current recover 5HT receptor become spontaneously active without need 5HT bind receptor , investigator hypothesize one cause spasticity spinal cord injury . This research pave way develop new pharmacological rehabilitative therapy control spasticity spinal cord injury augment residual motor movement .</brief_summary>
