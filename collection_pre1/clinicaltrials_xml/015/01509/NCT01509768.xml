	<criteria>Each patient must meet follow criterion enrol study . 1 . Definitive diagnosis MPS IIIB , determine one following : 1 . Documented deficiency alphaNacetylglucosaminidase ( NAGLU ) enzyme activity ≤10 % low limit normal range measure fibroblast , leukocyte , plasma , serum ( base normal range diagnosis MPS IIIB ) . Patients already documented deficiency NAGLU activity provide blood sample screen determination NAGLU activity level serum . OR 2 . Two documented mutation NAGLU gene . Patients already document genotype NAGLU provide blood sample screen NAGLU genotyping . 2 . The patient ≥1 &lt; 10 year age age equivalent Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS ) ≥1 year 3 . The patient medically stable , opinion Investigator , accommodate protocol requirement , include travel assessment , without place undue burden patient/patient 's family . 4 . The patient , patient 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) voluntarily sign date Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committeeapproved inform consent ( assent applicable ) form relevant aspect study explain discussed patient , patient 's parent ( ) , legal guardian ( ) . Patients exclude study meet follow criterion screen : 1 . Presence significant nonMPS IIIB related central nervous system ( CNS ) impairment behavioral disturbance , sufficient , opinion Investigator , preclude performance study neurocognitive developmental testing procedure , would confound scientific integrity interpretation study assessment . 2 . Visual hearing impairment sufficient preclude cooperation neurodevelopmental testing . 3 . Patient know suspected hypersensitivity anesthesia think unacceptable risk anesthesia , due airway compromise condition , opinion Investigator . 4 . Personal history family history neuroleptic malignant syndrome , malignant hyperthermia , anesthesiarelated concern . 5 . History poorly control seizure disorder . 6 . Currently receive psychotropic medication , Investigator 's opinion would likely substantially confound test result . 7 . History bleed disorder , inability abstain medication affect blood clotting ( e.g. , aspirin , Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ) , history ingestion within 1 week prior lumbar puncture . 8 . History complication previous lumbar puncture , opinion Investigator , place patient increase risk procedure . 9 . The patient participating , plan participate , participate clinical trial another investigational medicinal product , received vaccination , within 30 day prior study less 5 half life ( whichever longer ) investigational product . 10 . History hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplant . 11 . Unable assent , patient 's parent ( ) patient 's legal guardian ( ) is/are unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study , do/does agree comply protocol define schedule assessment . 12 . Patient unable comply protocol ( e.g. , clinically relevant medical condition make implementation protocol difficult , unstable social situation , otherwise unlikely complete study ) , opinion Investigator , otherwise unsuited study . 13 . The patient item ( brace , tattoo , etc ) would exclude patient able undergo MRI accord local Institutional Policy , patient situation would exclude patient undergoing procedure require study . 14 . The patient pregnant .</criteria>
