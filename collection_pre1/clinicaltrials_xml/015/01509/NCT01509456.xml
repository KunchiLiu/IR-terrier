	<brief_summary>Mainly due absence gravitational force weightlessness , astronauts suffer increase bone loss- negatively affect health vitality mission . The development effective countermeasure loss include many different aspect like sport also nutrition . Alkaline salt , abundant fruit vegetable , show positive effect marker bone turnover postmenopausal woman also men young adult . With current study effect potassium bicarbonate supplementation add standardise , strictly control , definite diet healthy , young men , verify within 21 day 6°- HDT- Bedrest- gold standard simulate weightlessness within earthbound condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Astronauts space suffer increase bone loss mainly related absence gravitational force . This increase bone reduction accompany high concentration calcium urine respect enhance risk renal stone . Due fact , bones´ regeneration occur rapidly even return earth , astronauts face increase risk osteoporosis . Nutritional factor deficient intake calcium , energy fluid abundant intake table salt exhibit additional negative effect bone . Results several study consistently show negative effect acid bone ( increased bone loss ) . With respect space mission long duration one big challenge development countermeasure negative consequence weightlessness bone . As needed experiment development countermeasure conduct space , simulation model weightlessness 6° Head- Down- Tilt- Bedrest ( HDT- Bedrest ) implement earth , mime physiological condition weightlessness unload immobilisation low part body fluid shift . Alkaline salt , potassium bicarbonate ( KHCO3 ) , demonstrate positive effect bone supplement postmenopausal woman . Apart positive effect marker bone turnover , calcium concentration urine could reduce . Thus , main aim present study reduce immobilization induce bone resorption alkalize effect alkaline salt KHCO3 ` supplementation Head- Down- Tilt- Bedrest ( HDT- Bedrest ) -a lead simulation model weightlessness . The crossover design study consist two part equal length ( 36 day ) - 7 day adaptation , 21 day HDT- Bedrest , 6 day recovery 2 day long- term follow- . Both study part differ HDT- period , one group 8 healthy , young , male participate subject supplement 90 mmol KHCO3 daily ( 3 time day 30 mmol KHCO3 dilute 200 ml tab water , supplement together main meal ) , group receive 200 ml tab water without supplementation ( Control group ) . The measurement bone formation marker well bone resorption marker blood urine supply insight influence supplementation bone metabolism blood gas analysis together pH- value 24h- urine point alkalise effect KHCO3 . Further physiological system like protein muscle metabolism , body weight body composition , circulation neuro- vestibular system simultaneously investigation .</detailed_description>
