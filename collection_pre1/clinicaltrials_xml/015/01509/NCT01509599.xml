	<brief_summary>Leg vein circulation problem damage skin low leg , especially around ankle , make discolor , hard , itchy , red , swell . Ulcers often develop . Inflammation often present damage skin . This study test whether use special low compression , cool , boot-like gel wrap place around damage skin lower leg improve skin circulation prevent leg ulcer . The study hypothesis : A cryotherapy , low-compression cooling gel wrap ( CW ) plus usual care ( UC ) ( leg elevation , compression stocking ) intervention compare low compression non-cryotherapy `` sham '' wrap ( NW ) plus UC reduce tissue blood flow ( perfusion unit ) decrease incidence venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) 9-month study period individual Stage 4 5 venous insufficiency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This new trial ass efficacy home-based cryotherapy intervention add sequence tapered cool 30-day intense cooling period . The goal reduce skin blood flow chronically inflamed skin , decrease incidence venous leg ulcer pain , improve quality life . A myriad surgical , pharmacologic , non-pharmacologic therapy compression bandage often try , many limited success . More 70 % patient venous disorder insufficiency develop edema , skin damage , ulcer . Ulcer prevention warrant significant socioeconomic implication term lose workday wage , decreased productivity increase health care cost . Clinicians focus multiple treatment approach , often without consideration patient contribute self-care . Our 9-month intervention base principle heat transfer cryotherapy theory involve microcirculation . With input cryotherapy expert participant complete R21 pilot , investigator propose sequence intervention strategy , cool dose daily 30 minute first month , decrease twice weekly dose month 2-3 , weekly month 4-6 , PRN month 7-9 . The investigator measure blood flow , skin temperature , pain , quality life , incidence leg ulcer month 1 , 3 , 6 9 . Eligible participant randomize treatment ( low compression cool wrap ) usual care ( low compression non-cooling `` sham '' wrap ) . Participants group receive study related material include standardized instruction , skin thermometer , specially design low compression wrap , leg elevator pillow , compression stocking , in-depth orientation session . The investigator hypothesize cryotherapy enhance largely ineffective non-pharmacologic self-care usual care model , , tell patient wear compression stocking , elevate leg , get exercise . These strategy generally inadequate achieve sustain change . Among research method investigator include rigorous process , impact outcome monitoring . In era expectation technological pharmaceutical `` fix '' , self-care strategy , efficacious , could economical way decrease morbidity pain thousand patient , frequently view non-responsive self care . Prevention ulcer also major potential source save medical dollar . This trial significant due burden venous disorder , complex physical characteristic population include excessive obesity co-morbidity need reach patient feasible , motivational , supportive strategy promote self-care . The objective establish new practice standard prevention .</detailed_description>
