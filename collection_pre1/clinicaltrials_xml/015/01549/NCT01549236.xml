	<brief_title>Population Pharmacokinetics Study Benznidazole Children With Chagas'Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Chagas disease ( CD ) always focus pediatric population . Initially , treatment recommend acute congenital case ( include newborn diagnose birth ) , good parasitological response 60 % 85 % patient acute phase 90 % congenitally infected infant treat first year life . Despite exist treatment recommendation child CD ( birth 12y ) , formulation available meet need target pediatric population , especially young age group . Benznidazole ( Bz ) , develop 30 year ago main drug choice , available 'adult ' tablet strength 100 mg ( LAFEPE Benznidazol® ) . With lack pediatric formulation , 100mg tablet need fractionate ½ ¼ tablet prepare extemporaneous formulation ( macerate , dilute , suspension , etc ) adjust dose patient weight , often lead sub over-dosing , may affect safety efficacy treatment . With regard child , absolute lack information Bz PK pediatric population relationship treatment safety efficacy . In order respond need age-adapted , easy use pediatric formulation , DNDi LAFEPE join effort develop 12.5 mg dispersible Bz tablet target treatment CD child &lt; 20 Kg . Once formulation available , two pharmacokinetics study plan conduct : comparative bioavailability study adult healthy normal volunteer population pharmacokinetics study young child . The group newborns , birth - 2 years-old child , include represent population congenital case . Current estimate positive serology CD woman reproductive age vary considerably country-to-country range 5-40 % , vertical transmission rate 12 % . There consensus congenital infection may remain important mode transmission another generation , appropriate treatment target newborn possible control strategy ( high chance cure ) new pediatric formulation . Children 2-12 years-old also include target population , represent may infect via congenital vector-borne transmission , usually present early chronic indeterminate form disease . In CD endemic country group child usually diagnosed school community screen program , also high chance cure ( &gt; 60-75 % ) Bz treatment . Population PK chosen study design would minimise number sample per patient , important requirement study conduct pediatric population . The dearth PK data adult lack information variability target population allow power calculation use optimal sample design definition timing sample . Experts review available information recommend sparse sampling , 5 PK sample distribute absorption phase ( 1 sample ) , steady-state ( 2 sample ) elimination phase ( 2 sample ) . With total 5 PK measurement per patient total 80 patient stratified age , expect PK curve variability drawn adequate level precision . PK data obtain study expect inform age-adapted Bz regimen pediatric population affect CD .</detailed_description>
