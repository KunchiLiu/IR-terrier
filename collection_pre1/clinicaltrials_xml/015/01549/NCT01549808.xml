	<detailed_description>Background Many patient experience serious reduce functional ability form physical mental problem ( 1 ) critical illness prolong stay Intensive Care Unit . The critical illness entail need sedation mechanical ventilation lead immobilization consequence . The combination critical illness immobilization lead increase risk muscle deterioration assume condition deteriorates inflammatory response ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) . Immobilization important contributory cause reduce functional ability independent critical illness . The deterioration notice till year discharge hospital ( 1 , 6 ) physically show reduced ability walk ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) , mentally delirium , associate increased mortality extend period hospitalisation . The mentally effect show deterioration 1 year discharge hospital . The symptom appear difficulty concentrate evaluate poor health ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) . Mobilization positive effect functional ability patient , physically mentally ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) even mobilize connection wake call sedate patient 10 ) . The patient experience less fear dependency , control great extent ( 10 ) also significant increase ability walk show ( 13 ) . The mobilized patient few day delirium , mechanical ventilation lesser day Intensive Care Units ( 10 , 12 ) . It possible mobilize critically ill patient bed mean passive active exercise . The exercise consist get bed , sit edge bed , move bed chair , stand floor , stand , sit chair walking ( 10,13,14,15,16 ) , recommend close interdisciplinary collaboration nurse physiotherapist ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ) . Several study ( 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ) show safe possible mobilize critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilation . The incidence le 1 % ( 22 ) directly relate age , sex , number organ failure , co-morbidity endo-tracheal tube ( 10 , 21,22,25 ) . The incidence appear decease SAT &lt; 80 % ( 10 , 17 , 22 , 24 ) , subsidence prostration without sustain damage ( 22 ) , discontinuation enteral feeding probe ( 22 ) arterial catheter ( 10 ) , change systolic pressure ( 10,21,22 ) , patient-ventilator-asynchrony ( 10 ) . It recommend mobilization structure ( 10 , 15 , 18 , 22 ) guideline protocol , patient screen mobilization . It however obvious , soon intense patient endure mobilize . Our hypothesis early systematic mobilization improve functional ability critically ill patient , mentally physically . The purpose study : - To document effect early systematic mobilization critically ill patient - - evaluate mobilization protocol apply critically ill patient , include contribute relate knowledge soon intense patient endure mobilization . - To evaluate connection functional ability life expectancy critically ill patient compare population match age . The primary outcome measure functional ability patient related systematic mobilization . The patient stamina , balance , strength , experience sense control emotional energy relation social contact also measure . Correlation functional ability life expectancy measure judgment relation physical level activity , hospitalisation discharge . The secondary outcome measure mortality , day mechanical ventilation , number day delirium , bed rest Intensive Care Units hospital , factor contribute critical illness could influence patient ability recover ( view mobilization ) also measure . Design method : This intervention project multicenter design pre- post research relate effect early systematic mobilization critically ill patient ( 29 ) . Intervention data collection : The research divide 3 phase : An 8 month observation phase , 2 month implementation phase 8 month intervention phase . The effect measure difference functional level observation phase intervention phase related primary secondary outcome . Phase 1 : Observation phase The patient mobilize accord present routine hospital unit without guideline . Data register `` observation form '' ( exh1 ) , collect light present routine unit . Before form use , staff instruct verbally write . Inter-observer variation measure test 8 nurse Kappa statistic . Acceptable value Kappa 0.61-0.80 correspond high level agreement . Phase 2 implementation phase The mobilization protocol ( exh 2 ) formulate , inspire Perme ( 15 ) Gosselink ( 28 ) collaboration physiotherapist Slagelse Hospital , support staff early systematic training . In order strengthen project , staff involve process early , mobilization protocol use ( 31 , 32 ) . In unit establish `` steer group '' protocol make . The staff introduce protocol phase , expect implementation finish within period two month . Phase 3 intervention phase The patient mobilize accord mobilization protocol . The training consist improve balance , muscle strength stamen . Before mobilization ability patient evaluate accord contradiction prescreening ( exh 2 , 3 ) . The primary nurse physiotherapist evaluate allocate patient best possible mobilization stage . All patient mobilize minimum 3 time day ( exh 2 ) support two person minimum . Before activity patient must rest period ½ hour . The security patient mobilization register ( exh 1 , 3 ) . The mobilization stop security affect . During walks patient follow member staff push chair behind , order prevent cushion fall . Participants : 100 patient included observation phase project , another 100 intervention phase , accord follow criterion : Patients hospitalize Unit 4141 , Rigshospitalet ICU Slagelse , intubate 48 hour , age ≥18 , positive confirmation relatives patient hospitalization able read understand instruction . Excluded : Patients terminal illness , user wheelchairs , patient know cognitive disturbance , open thorax , ECMO , VAD , IABP , patient mobilization contradict , finally patient live outside Sjaelland , Lolland Falster . Patients vary totally dependent help towards alteration independence require method measure detect shift functional ability hospitalization discharge hospital . No single method measurement detect shift per se therefore necessary use various method measure functional ability patient . The appraisal mental ability patient , understood consciousness evaluate daily RASS score , delirium CAM ICU ( exh 1 , 3 ) . After discharge patient evaluate functional ability , understood control emotional energy relate social contact human being , questionnaire SF 36 ( exh 4 ) . All 3 measurement validate number International Danish project therefore regard suitable critically ill patient ( 34 , 35 ) The appraisal functional ability patient , understood capability mobilize hospitalization `` Cumulated Ambulation Score '' ( CAS ) . CAS show independency development patient regard basic mobility day , understood capability get bed , stand , sit walk ( exh 1 , 3 ) . CAS , originally validate patient hip fracture , recommend broad group patient ( 36 ) . Pain evaluate numeric rang scale ( NRS ) ( 37 ) mobilization ( exh 1 , 3 ) . In addition varying form mobilization like stand , sit , walk also accident register ( exh 1,3 ) At discharge ICU ward home , development functional ability register mean ADL , Bartel-20 ( exh 5 ) . ADL registration show ability patient fulfill daily living , Bartel-20 clarify functional ability 10 select area ( 38 , 39 ) validate internationally Denmark ( 40 ) . In order follow development physical strength , endurance balance `` Rejse Sætte Sig '' test use ( exh 6 ) also `` Timed Up Go '' ( TUG ) ( exh 7 ) . The test `` Rejse Sætte Sig `` clarifies level strength lower part body , balance risk fall . The TUG test recommend predict physical strength balance patient neither self-reliant totally dependent ( 41 ) . The shift ability patient self-reliant home evaluate `` New Mobility Score '' ( exh 8 ) . The test clarify ability self-reliant home show acceptable reliability score ( 42 , 43 , 44 ) . In order measure connection functional ability life expectancy match Danish population correlate age `` Fysisk Aktivitet Fritiden '' use ( exh 9 ) . The score clarify physical activity also recommend clarify risk dependency death ( 45 ) . In order estimate outcome critically ill patient Apache SAPS use . Both validate critically ill patient ( 46 , 47 ) . Statistic Calculation strength do base previous study key parameter walk distance meter ADL measure bartel-20 . Sample size calculation ADL Interval scale Type 1 error : 5 % Est.SD:43 The least difference mean : 20,00 Type 2 error : 20 % Patients need group : 72 Sample size calculation walk distance ( 20 estimate ) Interval scale Type 1 error : 5 % Est.SD : 20 The least difference mean : 10 , 00 Type 2 error : 20 % Patients need group : 62 Processing data : Data register Excel , process SPSS statistically compare X2 ( ( 48 ) keep safe server `` log '' back ups , Rigshospital Slagelse Hospital , accessible member project group . Timeschedule The research start 2011.02.01 . The observation phase run 2011.02.01 2011.12.31 . The implementation phase start 2012.01.01 expected end 2012.03.31 . The intervention phase schedule mobilization protocol implement , probably 2012.04.01 . The last patient expect include Jan 2013 . The research expect end 2014.01.31 Preliminary result expect Apr . 2014 . Final result expect July 2014 . Settings The Anesthesiological Thorax ICU ( 4141 ) Rigshospitalet room 19 patient . The commonly treat problem heart failure , thorax surgery , lung transplantation thoracotomy . Adverse side effect circulation failure , renal failure sepsis need gradual reduction ventilator physical rehabilitation . The ICU single room , double room , one room four patient one six patient . The physiotherapist evaluate start training consist excise improve strength , ability sit , stand walk . The training always medically prescribe . The different transition take place use lift . ICU Slagelse Hospital room 10 patient , single room . The commonly treat patient group patient complication gastointestinal surgery , medical orthopedic patient . Compared 4141 Rigshospitalet ICU Slagelse also treat patient adverse side effect circulation failure , renal failure , sepsis patient need gradual reduction ventilator need physical rehabilitation . As 4141 Rigshospitalet physiotherapy medically prescribe . The training consist prevention patient move , patient cooperate training consist improve physical function , move around bed , sit bedside , stand , turn around walk . As 4141 Rigshospitalet different transition take place use lift ceiling beginning . The assistive technology use unit , ceiling lift , walker , wheelchair , adaptable armchair mobile ventilator . Processing data : In observation phase intervention phase data collect follow : The nurse caring patient every day collect data regard evaluation consciousness , pain , basic mobility security mobilization . A member project group ( exh 12 ) include patient obtains consent , perform test discharge ICU , 5th day ward , finally home discharge . Before visit home , patient contact telephone order accept schedule date visit allow u send questionnaire . The test conduct close possible day discharge ICU , 5th day ward 3 12 month return home . Deviation exact date first 2 test vary +/- 1 day , test 3 12 month +/- 10 day . Ethics The project approve `` The Science/Ethical Committee '' ( exh 13 ) `` Datatilsynet '' accord `` Law Privacy '' , data store accord regulation `` Datatilsynet '' ( exh 14 ) . The project carry accord `` Ethical Guidelines Research perform Nurses Nordic Area '' , build `` Ethical Principles '' express Helsinki Declaration UN Human Rights Declaration ( 49 , 50 ) . In observation phase , approval gather soon patient regard clear mind . If patient situate single room , always possible save move patient bedroom , approval , observation phase intervention phase , obtain regard integrity patient . The participant inform equally verbally write present relative . If participant wish continue project , exclude promptly . In intervention phase participant often sedate therefore necessary inform relative/substitute/personal doctor verbally write order obtain approval . The relative contact one member project group patient ICU 24 hour , approval need 24 hour . The verbal information give member steer group separate room away patient . The write information hand time . Final approval request , write information read . As soon participant assess awake clear mind , ask participation . Financing The result finance ICU account , also application fund ( exh 8,19 ) .
