	<detailed_description>COPD multiple etiology organ impair inflammatory disease . In clinical characteristic include airway inflammatory response , cili mobility impairment lung consolidation change ; others change include : functional impairment malnutrition , body mass loss , osteogenesis osteoporosis . The prevalence osteoporosis osteopenia patient generally high healthy subject chronic disease . Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increase risk osteoporosis fracture . Risk factor smoke , advanced age , physical inactivity , malnutrition , low weight may responsible , number pathophysiological explanation include presence chronic inflammatory state increase level proinflammatory cytokine protein catalytic enzyme may also involve . The use oral glucocorticoid also significant risk factor . Osteoporosis , however , may equally disable COPD , may impair respiratory function even patient experience vertebral compression loss height The number patient osteoporosis rise osteoprosis become important medical public health issue population get old include Taiwan . Osteoporosis silent disease thus important screen osteoporosis institute treatment dreduce fracture incidence . In study , survey prevalence , correlation effectiveness intervention osteoporosis COPD patient . This study purpose hope understand patient 's osteoporosis status , pulmonary function impairment exercise intolerance . Then , may prevent unnecessary fracture maintance bone mineral contains pulmonary rehabilitation program training osteoporosis COPD patient .</detailed_description>
