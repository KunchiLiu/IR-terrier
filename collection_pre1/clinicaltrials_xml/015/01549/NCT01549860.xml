	<brief_title>Effects Non Contact Low Frequency Ultrasound Healing Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compare treatment effect non-contact low frequency ultrasound addition standard care versus standard care alone heal chronic venous leg ulcer subject document venous stasis reflux . Subjects screen meet major inclusion criterion receive standardized treatment 30 40 mmHg compression , moist wound heal dressing , debridement two week run-in period . If study ulcer decrease great 30 % eligible randomization . The primary endpoint wound area reduction four ( 4 ) week study treatment . The study perform 22 study center . The study include two sub-studies : fluid tissue analysis wind recidivism registry ongoing .</detailed_description>
