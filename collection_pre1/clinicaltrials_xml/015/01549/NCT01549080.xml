	<detailed_description>3 . INVESTIGATION PLAN 3.1 Study Design Plan This study double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized Parallel-group trial . Guang'anmen Hospital sponsor design clinical trial protocol . No.303 Hospital Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) collaborator , patient come . 3.2 Random Method Using randomize block design，stratifying α-Thalassemia β-Thalassemia , patient allocate randomly 1:1 Yisui Shengxue Granules group placebo group . Statistic Analysis System ( SAS , SAS institute , Cary , NC , USA ) use produce 001~120 random code , match 120 subject divide randomly 1:1 Yisui Shengxue Granules group placebo group . 3.3 Blinding Design 3.3.1 Packaging study drug placebo : drug include medical emergency envelops must repackaged reallocate accord regulation standard double-blind clinical trial . 3.3.2．Blinding The encode data keep Guang'anmen Hospital , China Academy Chinese Medical Sciences . When patient fulfill procedures trial , data enter electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ) lock , blind disclose . If unmasking necessary serious , unexpected related adverse event medical emergency occur require knowledge exact therapy , investigator may contact principal investigator censor determine whether medical emergency envelop broken . The date reason code breaking must document signed information must send sponsor collaborator . The patient withdrawn Study Medication follow accord protocol . If twenty percent medical emergency envelop broken blind method betray , trial fail . 3.4 Sample Size Estimation A total 120 patient require ( α-Thalassemia : 80 , β-Thalassemia : 40 ) , assume relative risk sample loss ( 20 % ) whole trial -- accrual period 3 month treatment minimum 3 month follow . The number patient study drug group placebo group equal . 4.6 Removal Patients Study 4.6.1 Investigators make decision patient ' withdrawal . Investigators decide withdraw patient follow condition middle trial : 1 . Upper respiratory tract infection temperature high 38.5℃ . This condition lead hemolysis aggravation hemoglobin level decrease , affect evaluation therapeutic effect . The patient regard invalid case withdraw trial accept therapy . 2 . Anemia complication physiological change make patient unsuitable continue clinical study . 3 . Patients , poor compliance , take Study Medication less 80 % 120 % . 4 . Unblinding case unmask case medical emergency . 5 . Taking prohibited drug . 6 . Refusing take Study Medication . 4.6.2 Patients make decision withdrawal . In accordance World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki ( 1996 version ) , amend time time , patient right withdraw study time reason , without prejudice future medical care physician institution , oblige give reason . Without compromise right patient withdraw trial , every effort make understand accommodate concern avoid withdrawal wherever possible . If patient fulfill therapy , test , follow-up reason , patient deal removal study . 4.6.3 The case report form withdrawal patient , whatever reason , must keep . The last test result deal terminal result enter full analysis set . If significant effect show less 3 moth , patient consider significant effective case though complete trial advance . 4.7 Termination Criteria Trial termination mean study may terminate time study represent serious medical risk patient . 1 . Serious safety risk . 2 . Gross error clinical trial protocol major deviation appear trial execution . 3 . Sponsor 's request ( reason finance , administration , etc . ) 5.3 The Packaging Boxes Preservation In large packaging box , three medium size pack box , contain 3 month dosage Study Medication one patient . The Study Medication either Yisui Shengxue Granules placebo accord random code , preserve specially-assigned person store dry environment room temperature . 5.4 Drugs Assignment , Checking Return Study Medication deliver clinical center accord Study Medication code randomly assign clinical center , distributed patient , fulfill inclusion criterion , order drug code 3 time . `` Drug Used Report '' fill timely kept drug administrator . Investigators record Study Medication quantity patient receive , take , return visit . 5.5 Drugs Blinding Medical Emergency Envelope Study Medication blind make corresponding department accord randomization list . A medical emergency envelope , detailed information medication , prepared every randomization code keep principal investigator clinical center . 5.6 Precautions Prohibited Drug Combination 1 . In Trial , drug β-Thalassemia prohibit . 2 . Patients , take drug disease , record item `` table use drug disease '' CRF . 6 . OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS 6.1 General Conditions ( Before Entering Trial ) 1 . Record age , gender , body weight height . 2 . Record past medical history : course disease , diagnosis Western Medicine Chinese Medicine , type Thalassemia , course treatment , combine disease concomitant medication . 6.2 Indexes Safety Evaluation ( Before After Trial ) ( 1 ) Temperature , blood pressure , respiratory rate heart rate ( 2 ) Routine test blood , urine stool ( 3 ) ECG ( 4 ) Liver function ( ALT ) ( 5 ) Kidney function ( BUN , Cr ) ( 6 ) Record relevant adverse event 6.3 Indexes Therapeutic Effects Evaluation 6.3.1 Major index 1 . Clinical effect : screen visit ( visit 1 ) , visit 2 ( 4 week later ) , visit 3 ( 8 week later ) , visit 4 ( 12 week later , end medication therapy ) , visit 5 ( follow-up 3 month later medication therapy ) . 2 . Chinese Medicine syndrome improvment : screening visit ( visit 1 ) , visit 2 ( 4weeks later ) , visit 3 ( 8 week later ) , visit 4 ( 12 week later , end medication therapy ) , visit 5 ( follow-up 3 month later medication therapy ) . 6.3.2 Secondary index 1 . Blood test : white blood cell , hemoglobin , red blood cell , reticulocyte percentage , hemoglobin eletrophoresis , fetal Hb , HbA2 , HbH , platelet . Screening visit ( visit 1 ) , visit 2 ( 4weeks later ) , visit 3 ( 8 week later ) , visit 4 ( 12 week later , end medication therapy ) , visit 5 ( follow-up 3 month later medication therapy ) . 2 . Hepatic oblique diameter spleen horizontal diameter ultrasound image test ( Before trial ) . 3 . Improvement individual symptom : Screening visit ( visit 1 ) , visit 2 ( 4weeks later ) , visit 3 ( 8 week later ) , visit 4 ( 12 week later , end medication therapy ) , visit 5 ( follow-up 3 month later medication therapy ) . 8 . ADVERSE EVENTS 8.1 Adverse Event Record During trial , adverse event happen , occurrence time , severity , duration , therapeutic measure clinical outcome must record authentically `` DRUG ADVERSE EVENT FORM '' . 8.2 Severity Adverse Event The severity adverse event grade follow : Mild : Mild , tolerable discomfort , need special management , influence trial patient 's rehabilitation . Moderate : Moderate intolerable discomfort , special management necessary , direct influence patient 's rehabilitation . Severe : Severe discomfort , life-threatening , death disability possible emergency intervention necessary . 8.3 Relationship Study Medication 8.3.1 Identification standard 1 . Whether reasonable relationship time take Study Medication occurrence suspect adverse reaction . 2 . Whether suspect adverse reaction accord adverse reaction know Study Medication . 3 . Whether suspect adverse reaction interpret result drug combination , patient 's clinical condition , therapy . 4 . Whether suspect adverse reaction disappear relieve reduce Study Medication dosage stop take . 5 . Whether suspect adverse reaction occur time retake suspect drug ?
