	<brief_title>Primary Cell Culture Hepatic Tumorous Cells From Routine Fine-needle Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytology biopsy hepatic tumor frequently apply collection specimen consider safe , efficacious , accurate cost effective . Our previous study small number patient show specimen obtain FNA potential apply primary culture cancer cell . This study modify method primary culture hepatocellular carcinoma cell cancer-associated fibroblast patient tumor measure large equal 3cm . All patient receive one session aspiration diagnosis hepatic tumor . The aspirated specimen apply cytologic pathologic examination first . After , 10 mL 0.9 % NaCl aspirate needle connect syringe inject 15 mL sterilize centrifugation tube . If tube contain visible specimen , specimen send primary culture .</detailed_description>
