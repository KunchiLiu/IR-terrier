	<brief_summary>Graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) major complication follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) may cause acute life-threatening morbidity chronic disability . Although corticosteroid , primary agent treat GVHD , may effective patient , outcomes refractory corticosteroid dismal . Secondary agent use steroid-refractory case ; however , efficacy variable usually limit . The quality life issue chronic GVHD especially important pediatric survivor longer life expectancy adult . Many in-vitro in-vivo data support immunoregulatory property mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) possibilities treat disease cause immune dysregulation GVHD . Recent data reveal bone marrow-derived MSCs useful treat steroid-refractory acute GVHD , lead improved overall survival compare control . More recently , number report suggest MSCs may also useful treat chronic GVHD well acute GVHD . It also report third party MSCs also useful well autologous HLA-matched donor . The investigator recently demonstrate MSCs obtain umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) similar immunosuppressive property bone marrow-MSCs . UCB-MSCs obtain without harm donor may appropriate source MSCs bone marrow off-the-shelf use . However , little known safety efficacy UCB-MSCs treating GVHD . Therefore , investigator design study evaluate safety efficacy UCB-MSCs treat pediatric patient steroid-refractory acute chronic GVHD .</brief_summary>
