	<brief_summary>Living-donor kidney transplantation consider best treatment patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Kidney donation living donor perform widely noble humanity belief donation would harm donor . Although overall evidence propose live kidney donor medical outcome similar general population , several report demonstrate potential risk development hypertension , proteinuria , ESRD . Thus , effort concentrate ensure safety preserve function remain kidney anesthesia maintenance . Inhaled anesthetic frequently use induction maintenance general anesthesia . The metabolism certain inhaled anesthetic produce inorganic fluoride , may directly nephrotoxic impairment renal concentrate ability . The typical inhaled anesthetic commonly use nowadays sevoflurane desflurane . The defluorination sevoflurane result increase serum inorganic fluoride ion concentration , neprhotoxic effect sevoflurane proven yet human . On hand , desflurane extremely resistant defluorination , desflurane appear nephrotoxic . The inhaled anesthetic currently use general anesthesia clinical evidence nephrotoxicity , possible risk exclude entirely , especially patient one kidney donate . The purpose current retrospective , single center study evaluate compare postoperative renal function live kidney donor nephrectomy sevoflurane desflurane anesthesia , make evidence-based recommendation proper inhaled anesthetic anesthesia live kidney donor .</brief_summary>
