	<brief_summary>The PeerScope System consist Peer Medical camera head , endoscope , video system , light source ancillary equipment . The system intend endoscopic diagnosis , treatment video observation digestive tract . The PeerScope system model B indicate use endoscopy endoscopic treatment within low digestive tract ( include anus , rectum , sigmoid colon , colon ileocecal valve ) adults patient . Objective : To compare additional diagnostic yield obtain use PeerScope System™ extend view vs. diagnostic yield obtain Standard view colonoscopy . In addition , time measurement include time cecum , time withdrawal overall procedure time analyze report group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polyp Detection With The Peerscope System™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Patients schedule screening , surveillance diagnostic colonoscopy recruit study randomize one two group . Each enrol subject undergo two `` back-to-back '' procedure . Subjects Group A ( study group ) undergo Standard view colonoscopy follow immediately PeerScope System™ extend view colonoscopy . Subjects Group B ( control group ) undergo PeerScope System™ extend view colonoscopy follow immediately Standard view colonoscopy . Results two group analyze compare , primary outcome measure detection rate total polyps detection rate adenomas . Secondary outcome measure include withdrawal time , total procedure time characteristic polyp detect , include size histological result . Subjects follow 24 hour 7 day telephone interview analysis unexpected adverse event . Clinical result analyze use various statistical measure significance . Study Design : Multi-center study 196 patient . No . Patients : Up 196 treat patient enrol study . Primary Performance Endpoint : - Standard view colonoscopy adenoma overall detection rate compare extend view overall adenoma detection rate use PeerScope System™ - Standard view colonoscopy overall polyp detection rate compare extend view overall polyp detection rate use PeerScope System™ . Safety Analysis : Incidence device-related procedure-related serious adverse event . Incidence complication use PeerScope System™ Known complication include : - Perforation ; - Severe abdominal pain ; - Infection ; - Bleeding ( expect minor bleed due therapeutic procedure e.g . polypectomy ) ; - Inducing inflammation diverticulum - Arrhythmia , bradycardia , hypotension , hypoxia - Death Secondary Endpoints / Other Outcomes : 1 . Performance therapeutic intervention , biopsy , polypectomy , APC etc . 2 . Procedure time . The follow record : . Time intubation cecum . b . Time withdrawal cecum anal verge . c. Total procedure time A stopwatch use stop timing procedure polypectomy perform restart polypectomy complete , mean purely procedure time measure 3 . Sedation dosage 4 . Patient satisfaction . Patient 's pain end procedure record use VAS scale . Results 24 hour telephone follow-up assess post-procedural patient satisfactory record CRF . Inclusion criterion : - Subject age 18 70 - The patient undergo colonoscopy screening , surveillance follow-up previous polypectomy diagnostic workup ; - Written informed consent must available enrollment trial - For woman childbearing potential , adequate contraception Exclusion criterion : - Patients history colonic resection ; - Patients know ( newly diagnose ) inflammatory bowel disease ; - Patients personal history polyposis syndrome ; - Patients suspect chronic stricture potentially preclude complete colonoscopy ; - Patients diverticulitis toxic megacolon ; - Patients history radiation therapy abdomen pelvis ; - Patients acute low GI bleed - Patients currently enrol another clinical investigation intervention might compromise safety patient 's participation study .</detailed_description>
