	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Zevalin Versus Zevalin Motexafin Gadolinium Patients With Rituximab-Refractory Low-grade Follicular B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , open-label study design compare safety efficacy therapy Zevalin regimen versus Zevalin motexafin gadolinium patient rituximab-refractory , low-grade follicular NHL . Approximately 100 adult patient enrol study ( approximately 50 group 15 clinical site North America ) . Patients screen eligibility within 14 day prior Day 1 study . Once write informed consent obtain patient eligibility establish , patient randomize 1:1 receive either Zevalin Zevalin motexafin gadolinium . Patients assess safety visit study center disease response Months 3 , 6 12 . An end-of-study-visit perform Month 12 . Disease status assess use positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET/CT , and/or flow cytometry . Disease response evaluate accordance standardize definition criteria International Working Group Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma . The efficacy endpoint assess complete response rate overall response rate . Safety assess adverse event , physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAEs ) collect patient begin Day 1 continue end-of study-visit perform Month 12 withdrawal study .</detailed_description>
