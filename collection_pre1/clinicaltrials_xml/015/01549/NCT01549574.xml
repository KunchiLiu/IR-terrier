Screening supine blood pressure &gt; = 140 mm Hg ( systolic ) &gt; =90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , single measurement ( confirm single repeat , necessary ) follow least 5 minute rest . Screening 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 QRS interval &gt; 120 msec Screening . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . Pregnant nursing female ; female childbearing potential , include tubal ligation . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication .
