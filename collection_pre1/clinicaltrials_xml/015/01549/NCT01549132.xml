	<brief_summary>The investigator believe oxygen saturation measurement retina may provide information well retina work may detect problem retina early fundus fluorescein angiography ( FFA ) . This may useful ophthalmologist may identify abnormal area retina commence change treatment may prevent irreversible blindness . Most patient clinically significant macular oedema and/or ischaemic diabetic retinopathy could either laser Intravitreal Anti-VEGF injection treatment provide counseled risk . It know Anti-VEGF injection reduce oedema believe laser treatment retina condition improve oxygen supply retina sometimes reverse damage . It useful take picture treat eye use Oxymap spectral retinal camera ( ) see whether investigator detect change oxygen saturation retina treatment use oxygen saturation method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>WHAT IS SPECTRAL IMAGING ? This way study detail area image . This do picture area take use different colour light ( wavelength ) . Different material picture absorb reflect different wavelength light hyperspectral camera differently . It possible look point picture work picture . This used satellite aeroplane identify ground . For example , distinguish different type tree grind base different way absorb reflect different wavelength light . USING SPECTRAL IMAGING IN MEDICINE . Spectral image found us medicine ability distinguish one thing another . A lot Spectral image research do measure amount oxygen blood . This oxygen important living cell human body - without cell would die stop work . Oxygen carry live cell blood blood vessel know artery leave carry away vein . Most oxygen blood transport cell blood contain chemical call haemoglobin . There two main form haemoglobin call oxyhaemoglobin ( haemoglobin bind oxygen ) deoxyhaemoglobin ( haemoglobin bound oxygen ) . The proportion oxyhaemoglobin total amount haemoglobin ( oxyhaemoglobin deoxyhaemoglobin ) call oxygen saturation present percentage . The normal saturation artery 97 % contains oxyhaemoglobin vein 75 % contain less oxyhaemoglobin . Importantly oxyhaemoglobin ( HbO2 ) deoxyhaemoglobin ( Hb ) different spectral characteristic - i.e absorb light differently various wavelength light . This extensively document various publication use sample blood . This property basis pulse oximetry measurement oxygen saturation ( OS ) finger tip use saturation probe commonly use hospital . The different spectral characteristic Hb HbO2 also use spectral image calculate amount blood perform oxygen saturation measurement certain part body . This previously use study oxygen supply skin also look oxygen supply patient diabetes condition cause lack hormone call insulin cause high amount sugar blood result damage blood vessel . Spectral image recently start used imaging eye . The main emphasis Spectral image ophthalmology measure oxygen saturation retina ( layer back eye allow u see ) . This call retinal oximetry . In essence , principles retinal oximetry similar pulse oximetry , i.e use different spectral characteristic Hb HbO2 calculate oxygen saturation . In diabetic retinopathy , way investigator study blood supply perform Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram ( FFA ) . This invasive test involve injection dye arm , dye transport blood eye picture blood vessel take dye . Also , importantly , side effect ( sometimes life−threatening ) inject dye arm . If problem blood supply retina dye fill blood vessel see picture black area . The FFA provide information blood supply directly amount oxygen . Loss sight diabetic retinopathy age−related macular degeneration believe cause reduction amount oxygen supply retina blood vessel . The investigator believe oxygen saturation measurement retina use spectral imaging could useful test ophthalmologist may provide information well retina work may detect problem retina early FFA . This may useful ophthalmologist may identify abnormal area retina commence change treatment may prevent irreversible blindness .</detailed_description>
