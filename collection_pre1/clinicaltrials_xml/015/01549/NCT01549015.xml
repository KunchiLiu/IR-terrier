	<brief_summary>This diagnostic study perform investigate performance urea cycle healthy subject , asymptomatic carrier Urea Cycle Disorders ( UCD ) mutation subject genetically proven urea cycle disorder . The ureagenesis rate measure 13C incorporation assay , method vivo measurement urea cycle performance stable isotope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Healthy Subjects , Patients With Urea Cycle Disorders ( UCD ) Carriers UCD Mutations Evaluate Urea Cycle Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In diagnostic study CCD09 , urea metabolism UCD subject ( patient carrier ) healthy subject different age sex assess measurement incorporation 13C orally take sodium [ 1,2-13C ] -acetate urea 13C stable isotope ratio detection . The aim study determine 13C urea production quantify total urea production healthy subject , gene defect carrier patient marker function urea cycle . Since still data available use specific method measurement urea cycle performance , aim study CCD09 gain additional result 13C assay . To end , comparison make 13C urea production observe healthy subject , UCD patient , asymptomatic mutation carrier . An evaluation study may also enable treat physician well judge severity disease future risk metabolic decompensations patient well potential risk far asymptomatic carrier .</detailed_description>
