The dosage ACE inhibitor and/or ARB must stable 2 week prior Screening ( i.e. , change dosage medication ) . Patients take ACE inhibitor and/or ARB , take ACE inhibitor and/or ARB level goal dose set K/DOQI guideline ( see Appendix B ) must document medical contraindication ( e.g. , hyperkalemia , hypotension ) , investigator must provide discuss medical monitor prior Study Day 1 . Patients take ACE inhibitor and/or ARB medical contraindication must discontinue treatment least 8 week prior Screening ; 6 . Mean systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) must ≤ 160 mmHg ≥ 105 mmHg mean diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) must ≤ 90 mmHg screening ; 7 . Willing practice method birth control ( male partner childbearing potential female childbearing potential ) screening Study Day 84 ; 8 . Female patient childbearing potential must nonpregnant nonlactating negative serum pregnancy test result prior enrollment study ; 9 . Willing able give write informed consent study participation ; 10 . Willing able cooperate aspect protocol ; 1 . Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( juvenile onset ) . If history diabetic ketoacidosis exists , fast Cpeptide level must confirm type 2 diabetes ; 2 . History renal transplant plan transplant live donor study ; 3 . Hemoglobin A1c level &gt; 11.0 % ( 97 mmol/mol ) screening ; 4 . Acute dialysis acute kidney injury within 24 week prior Study Day 1 ; 5 . Clinical sign and/or symptom uremia expect need renal replacement therapy within 12 week follow Study Day 1 , assess investigator ; 6 . Albumin/creatinine ratio ( ACR ) &gt; 3500 mg/g screening ; 7 . Recently active cardiovascular disease define : Unstable angina pectoris within 12 week Study Day 1 ; Myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass graft surgery , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent within 12 week Study Day 1 ; Cerebrovascular accident , include transient ischemic attack within 12 week Study Day 1 ; Current diagnosis Class III IV NYHA congestive heart failure ( Appendix C ) ; 8 . Clinical diagnosis severe obstructive valvular heart disease severe obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ; 9 . Atrioventricular block , 2° 3° , successfully treat pacemaker ; 10 . Diagnostic interventional procedure require contrast agent may induce nephropathy within 30 day prior Study Day 1 , plan study ; 11 . Systemic immunosuppression 15 day , cumulatively , within 12 week prior Study Day 1 , anticipate need immunosuppression study ; 12 . Total bilirubin , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) level great upper limit normal ( ULN ) alkaline phosphatase level great two time ULN ANY screen laboratory test result ; 13 . Iron saturation &lt; 20 % Study Day 1 . If iron saturation &lt; 20 % screening , iron supplement may provide prior Study Day 3 ; 14 .
