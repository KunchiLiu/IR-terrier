	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , combination panobinostat carfilzomib patient 's cancer . It determine side effect different dose level panobinostat carfilzomib determine best dose schedule two drug recommend future study . The study assess effect drug multiple myeloma . In addition , test study way drug work also do . The combination 2 drug class show pre-clinical ( study do lab ) clinical ( study do people ) effect multiple myeloma . For reason , 2 drug study combination determine side effect anti-myeloma effect 2 drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , phase I study panobinostat , carfilzomib patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . Based preclinical data support use combine histone de-acetylase ( HDAC ) proteasome inhibition , incidence single-agent panobinostat carfilzomib anti-myeloma activity , clinical data demonstrate safety efficacy panobinostat different proteasome inhibitor ( bortezomib ) , study evaluate combination panobinostat carfilzomib patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma phase I trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient age ≥ 18 year old 2 . Diagnosis multiple myeloma ( MM ) follow least one prior therapy ; maximum number prior therapy 3 . Patients must relapsed/ refractory disease need therapy evidence measurable disease define least one following : Serum M protein ≥ 0.5 g/dl ( ≥ 5g/l ) Urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hour Serum free light chain ( FLC ) assay : Involved FLC assay ≥ 10 mg/dl ( ≥100 mg/l ) abnormal serum free light chain ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) Measurable plasmacytoma ( Prior biopsy acceptable ) 4 . Ability provide write informed consent obtain prior participation study relate procedure perform 5 . Patients must meet follow laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L ( growth factor use within 3 day screen ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl ( PRBC transfusion use within 3 day screen ) Platelets ≥ 75 x 10⁹/L ( platelet transfusion use within 3 day screen ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum potassium ≥ low limit normal ( LLN ) Total serum calcium [ correct serum albumin ] ionize calcium ≥ LLN . ( treatment hypercalcemia allow subject may enroll hypercalcemia return normal standard treatment ) Serum magnesium ≥ LLN Serum phosphorus ≥ LLN Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min ( CockcroftGault calculation ) Clinically euthyroid . Note : Patients permit receive thyroid hormone supplement treat underlying hypothyroidism 6 . Baseline multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) echocardiogram ( ECHO ) must demonstrate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ low limit institutional normal 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 8 . Must willing able undergo bone marrow aspirate per protocol ( without bone marrow biopsy per institutional guideline ) . The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must adequate allow comparison onstudy efficacy assessment . 9 . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) An FCBP sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . 1 . Prior histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) , dichloroacetate ( DAC ) , valproic acid treatment cancer 2 . Prior treatment carfilzomib 3 . Daily requirement corticosteroid &gt; prednisone 10 mg/day equivalent 4 . Patients need valproic acid medical condition study within 5 day prior first panobinostat treatment 5 . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include one following : History presence sustain ventricular tachyarrhythmia . ( Patients history atrial arrhythmia eligible discuss Principal Investigator prior enrollment ) History congenital long QT syndrome Any history ventricular fibrillation torsade de pointes Bradycardia define heart rate ( HR ) &lt; 50 bpm . Patients pacemaker eligible HR ≥ 50 bpm . ECG evidence acute ischemia grade 3 conduction system abnormality ( unless subject pacemaker ) Screening ECG correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Patients myocardial infarction unstable angina ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure [ CHF ] New York Heart Association class III IV , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) ( Patients history atrial arrhythmia may eligible control approved Lead Principal Investigator ) 6 . Impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption panobinostat . Inability take oral medication , requirement IV alimentation , active peptic ulcer disease prior surgical procedure bowel resection affect absorption oral medication . 7 . Patients diarrhea &gt; Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) grade 1 ( increase 4 stool per day baseline mild increase ostomy output compare baseline ) 8 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes active uncontrolled infection ) include abnormal laboratory value , could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol 9 . Patients use medication relative risk prolong QT interval induce torsade de pointes treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug [ allow 72 hour washout period ] 10 . Concomitant use cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors 11 . Patients receive either vaccine antibody base therapy within ≤ 8 week ; chemotherapy within ≤ 4 week , immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) within 2 week ; radiation therapy &gt; 30 % marrowbearing bone within ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment ; yet recover side effect therapies 12 .
