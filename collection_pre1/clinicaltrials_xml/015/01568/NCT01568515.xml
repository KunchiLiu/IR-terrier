	<brief_summary>Introduction : Although vaccination HPV subsequent HPV-related cancer significant breakthrough , uptake low . We seek understand whether low-cost intervention electronic ( text and/or email ) appointment reminder couple electronic health educational messaging HPV HPV vaccine could increase HPV vaccine uptake knowledge among college student . Methods : Study participant include female male English speaking student age 18-26 attend large university North Carolina . Students randomized intervention control group . Intervention group participant receive electronic message control group receive standard care student health center across 7-month study period . Baseline follow-up survey data collect . Main outcome measure completion HPV-2 HPV-3 HPV HPV vaccine knowledge . Study recruitment run August 2011 December 2013 . Results : Completion rate intervention control group similar HPV-2 ( 53 % vs. 52 % ) HPV-3 ( 34 % vs. 32 % ) , respectively . The mean knowledge score follow-up intervention group participant ( n=44 , mean knowledge score = 93 % , SD = 0.08 ) significantly high ( p=0.01 ) mean knowledge score baseline ( n=44 , mean knowledge score = 87 % , SD = 0.11 ) . No significant change knowledge baseline follow-up find control group participant . The single important predictor HPV vaccine uptake overall female gender female participant 2.35 time [ confidence interval ( CI ) 1.17-4.69 ] likely complete series compare male participant . Conclusion : In sample college student , electronic message intervention increase knowledge uptake . More randomized control trial efficacy HPV vaccine electronic reminder intervention catch-up age population female male need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oncogenic type human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection cause cervical cancer , HPV type 16 18 cause roughly 70 % cervical cancer worldwide.1 Persistent HPV infection also link vaginal vulvar cancer woman , penile cancer men , well oral pharyngeal cancer , anal cancer , genital wart sexes.2-4 There two safe effective vaccine protect HPV type 16 18 one two vaccine ( HPV4 ) also protect two additional HPV type account 90 % case genital warts.5 Because HPV vaccination provide maximum protection administer prior sexual debut , HPV4 guideline recommend administration male female age 11 12 , catch-up vaccination age 26 , prevention cervical anal cancer well prevention genital warts.1,5-8 Although vaccination HPV-related cancer significant breakthrough , uptake low . The National Immunization Surveyâ€”Teen ( NIS-teen ) estimate 2013 , HPV vaccination coverage 13-17 year-old female 37.6 % , male age group coverage 13.9 % . Additionally , coverage 13-17 year-old female drop slightly 2011 2012.9 Although vaccination coverage teens increase time overall , rate far meet Healthy People 2020 goal 80 % 13-15 year old female fully vaccinate HPV 2020 . In addition teen , show benefit provide HPV vaccine young adult , even already sexually active . However , NIS-adult study show 10-12 % 18-26 year-old woman complete HPV vaccine series.10 Additionally , study find significantly low completion rate among African Americans.9,11-12 This problematic give African American woman demonstrate mortality rate cervical cancer twice Caucasian women.13 It also suggest lack knowledge may barrier vaccine adherence14 educational intervention may increase adherence among 18-26 year-old women.12 Given importance immunize young adult prevention cancer give low uptake HPV vaccine group , important develop evaluate strategy increase use adherence among population . We seek understand whether low-cost intervention electronic ( text and/or email ) appointment reminder couple electronic health educational messaging HPV HPV vaccine could increase HPV vaccine utilization , adherence , knowledge among college student ( female male ) attend large university eastern North Carolina . Although found one peer-reviewed study assess text email electronic HPV reminder primarily among adolescent , find study assess mail telephone HPV vaccination reminder among adolescent . All study find vaccination reminder effective increase adherence among adolescent and/or young adults.15-17 Hard copy electronic messaging reminder also proven effective couple prevention strategy immunization influenza pneumococcal pneumonia well screen colon , breast , cervical cancer adults.18 We find literature test electronic HPV vaccine intervention among college population . Our primary hypothesis student receive intervention would compliant uptake second ( HPV-2 ) third ( HPV-3 ) dose vaccine compare control group . Secondarily , hypothesized student receive intervention demonstrate high knowledge HPV HPV vaccine compare control group African American student young student ( define 18-19 year age ) would less compliant compare Caucasian old student ( defined student 20 old ) , demonstrated literature . Lastly , seek describe satisfaction health message reminder among receive .</detailed_description>
