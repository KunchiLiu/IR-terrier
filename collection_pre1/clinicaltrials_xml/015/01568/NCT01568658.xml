	<brief_summary>Background : - Some nerve muscle disorder start early life ( age 25 ) , like form muscular dystrophy , run family . However , genetic cause disorder know . Also , doctor fully understand symptom disorder change time . Researchers want learn genetic nerve muscle disorder start childhood studying affect people family member , well healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To good understand nerve muscle disorder start early life run family . Eligibility : - Individuals least 4 week old childhood-onset muscular nerve disorder , include later onset disorder typically childhood onset . - Affected unaffected family member individual muscular nerve disorder . - Healthy volunteer least 4 week old nerve muscle disorder . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Genetic information collect blood , saliva , cheek swab , skin sample . Urine sample may also collect . - Healthy volunteer unaffected family member image study muscle . These study include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound scan . Results compare affected participant . - All participant nerve muscle disorder multiple test , include follow : - Imaging study muscle , include ultrasound MRI scan . - Imaging study bone , x-rays DEXA scan . - Heart lung function test . - Eye exam . - Nerve muscle electrical activity test biopsy . - Video photo image collection affect muscle . - Speech , language , swallow evaluation . - Lumbar puncture collect spinal fluid study . - Tests movement , attention , thinking , coordination . - Participants nerve muscle disorder return Clinical Center every year . They repeat test study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To diagnose patient neuromuscular neurogenetic disorder congenital pediatric onset ( phase 1 protocol ) study natural history mechanism disease neuromuscular neurogenetic disorder childhood ( phase 2 protocol ) . Study Population : Patients childhood onset neuromuscular neurogenetic disorder , affect unaffected family member , healthy volunteer . Patients later onset disorder know typically childhood onset include well . Design : Diagnostic prospective longitudinal natural history study . Outcome Measures : Diagnose characterize patient neuromuscular neurogenetic disorder congenital pediatric onset study natural history underlie disease mechanism . In characterized patient population identify develop effective outcome measure use future clinical trial , include applicable motor scale , quality life scale , biomarkers blood urine , image study , pulmonary function test .</detailed_description>
