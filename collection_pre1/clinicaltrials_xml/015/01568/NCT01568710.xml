	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people sickle cell disease repeat episode severe pain last day , require hospital care . These episode , call pain crisis , may cause change blood flow . Researchers want study blood flow people sickle cell disease pain crisis compare blood flow pain crisis resolve . They also want compare measurement blood flow healthy people sickle cell disease . Objectives : - To study whether change blood flow cause pain crisis people sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age sickle cell disease treat pain crisis . - Individuals least 18 year age sickle cell disease experience pain crisis . - Healthy volunteer match age gender participant sickle cell disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants sickle cell pain crisis two visit , one crisis one 4 week crisis resolve . - Participants sickle cell pain crisis one two study visit . Blood sample collect least one visit . - Healthy volunteer one two study visit . Blood sample collect least one visit . - During visit participant , camera blood flow monitoring equipment use measure blood flow forearm . sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe recurrent pain common cause acute morbidity sickle cell disease1 . The underlying pathogenesis initially think ischemia obstruction capillary bed stiffen red blood cell ; however , evidence factor contribute pathogenesis sickle cell pain crisis , inflammation coagulation , ischemia-reperfusion injury , angiogenesis balance , vasomotor tone process regulate endothelial nitric oxide . Recent clinical data suggest subject sickle cell disease suffer chronically impaired nitric oxide bioavailability . This attribute increased consumption nitric oxide hemoglobin reactive oxygen specie , decrease production nitric oxide endothelial cell ; however roles nitric oxide bioavailability endothelial dysfunction acute pain crisis controversial incompletely understood . Although several study endothelial function steady state sickle cell disease , comprehensive study endothelial function pain crisis . In study , primary objective measure reactive hyperemia index ( measure endothelial response shear stress ) twenty sickle cell subject acute pain crisis compare reactive hyperemia index measure recovery pain crisis . This identify whether acute change endothelial cell function sickle cell pain crisis . Our secondary objective compare reactive hyperemia index thirty-five sickle cell subject steady state versus reactive hyperemia index thirty-five healthy control subject . This identify whether chronic difference endothelial function sickle cell subject healthy control subject . This study determine defect endothelium-dependent vasodilation response shear stress sickle cell pain crisis . Moreover , study provide opportunity evaluate new physiologic biomarkers sickle cell pain crisis base measurement blood flow , temperature , oxygenation skin . These measurement may serve clinical endpoint future study disease pathogenesis therapeutic intervention sickle cell disease .</detailed_description>
