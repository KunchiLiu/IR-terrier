	<brief_summary>Background : - About one-tenth adult sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension ( high blood pressure lung ) . This condition cause shortness breath , pain crisis , congestive heart failure . It may even lead death . Researchers want test drug imatinib carvedilol see treat high blood pressure lung . Both drug use treat type heart problem , test treatment high blood pressure relate sickle cell disease . Objectives : - To see imatinib carvedilol safe effective treatment high blood pressure lungs adult sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year age sickle cell disease may high blood pressure lung . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also different test heart lung function , include walk test imaging study . Blood urine sample also collect . - Participants meet specific criterion take one two possible study drug . Those receive imatinib take daily . Those receive carvedilol take twice day . - Participants weekly study visit blood test exams . The study drug dose adjust weekly visit . It increase slowly reach target dose ( base participant weight ) find stable effective dose . - Participants may continue take study drug 24 week , weekly study visit . Regular blood sample heart lung function test perform . - After 24 week , qualify participant may continue take study drug 6 month . They regular study visit monitor treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle Cell Disease relate pulmonary hypertension heterogeneous condition result high mortality therapy document beneficial . We propose perform safety tolerability study treatment base right heart catheterization derive hemodynamic profile associate high mortality cohort . These hemodynamic profile previously describe confirm large cohort well . We propose treatment sickle cell subject pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define hemodynamically pulmonary arterial mean pressure ( mPAP ) 25 mmHg great , low estimate leave ventricular filling pressure ( low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , PCWP ) , high pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , imatinib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor modifies Platelet Derived Growth Factor ( PDGF ) pathway . PDGF involve Sickle Cell relate PAH evidence imatinib effective treatment idiopathic PAH . The hemodynamic profile elevate mPAP elevate leave ventricular filling pressure also associate high mortality rate , propose treat subgroup carvedilol , unique beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist demonstrate attenuate adrenergic response improve right leave heart function . The third subgroup elevate mPAP hyperdynamic group , definition low PVR absence elevate leave ventricular filling pressure . This group also high risk longer period time less evident reason . We continue aggressive sickle cell management hyperdynamic group accord expertise offer Sickle Cell Group Clinical Center systematically follow intervene optimal care . Those quality three subgroup describe go fourth subgroup follow mortality data share . Our primary endpoint safety tolerability intervention secondary endpoint clinical efficacy treatment .</detailed_description>
