	<brief_summary>Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE ) cardiac magnetic resonance ( DCMR ) establish non-invasive technique , use clinical routine diagnostic classification risk stratification patient suspect known coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . In regard , regional wall motion abnormality ( WMA ) dobutamine stress , precede development ST-segment depression anginal symptom , enable detection anatomically significant CAD assessment clinical outcome . In head-to-head comparison 2 technique , favourable diagnostic characteristic term high sensitivity accuracy note DCMR compare DSE . Although reported stress induce WMA DCMR DSE independent predictor hard cardiac event cardiac death myocardial infarction , value 2 technique risk stratification patient CAD compare far . Comparison 2 non-invasive technique important , refer physician need know modality reliable identification patient high risk subsequent cardiac event , would benefit early invasive therapy . In investigator study investigator therefore seek compare ability DSE versus DCMR predict subsequent hard cardiac event revascularization procedure patient cohort high CAD prevalence . Their predictive value compare conventional atherogenic risk factor rest WMA . In addition , investigator seek determine technique equally suitable structure invasive conservative treatment accord presence absence inducible ischemia , respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dobutamine Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Versus Echocardiography Assessment Outcome . Are Two Imaging Modalities Comparable ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Both DSE DCMR implement daily diagnostic work-up patient ischemic heart disease . Although DCMR previously show aid diagnostic classification patient suspect CAD high sensitivity accuracy compare provide DSE , value 2 technique risk stratification patient CAD investigate far . Methods : Patients suspect known CAD underwent either DSE DCMR clinical reason use standardise high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol . Patient match perform age , gender coronary risk factor . Wall motion assess rest maximum stress , outcome data include cardiac death non-fatal myocardial infarction ( define hard cardiac event ) 'late ' revascularization perform &gt; 90 day MR-scans prospectively collect least 6 month DSE DCMR . Follow-up Data : Personnel unaware stress test result contact subject immediate family member date contact use calculate follow-up time duration . Outcome data collect standardized questionnaire determine patient interview outpatient clinic telephone interview . Reported clinical event confirm review correspond medical record electronic Hospital Information System ( HIS ) , contact general practitioner , refer cardiologist treat hospital . Cardiac death nonfatal myocardial infarction register major cardiac event . Cardiac death define death cardiac cause ( lethal arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure ) sudden unexpected death occur without another explanation . Myocardial infarction define angina &gt; 30 minute duration either ST segment elevation ≥2mm 2 consecutive ECG lead rise troponin T ≥0.03µg/l . Other event include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) . In case 2 simultaneous cardiac event , bad event select ( cardiac death &gt; non-fatal myocardial infarction &gt; revascularization ) .</detailed_description>
