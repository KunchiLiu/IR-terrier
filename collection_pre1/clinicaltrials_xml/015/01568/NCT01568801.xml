	<detailed_description>* Recruitment Potential subject identify ) inpatient refer prior discharge ii ) outpatients medical social worker Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) Alexandra Hospital ( AH ) . After confirm study eligibility medical social worker inform potential subject study ; obtain informed consent , medical social worker make telephone call Duke - NUS research fellow carry randomization process , assign subject either intervention group control group . * Sites The SingaPACE program locate 298 , Tiong Bahru Road , # 15-01/06 Central Plaza NTUC Eldercare , Block 117 , Bukit Merah View . * Procedures - Randomization stratify recruitment site gender , assure equal number men woman study arm ; hospital assure equal number patient SGH AH study arm . 20 participant enter study ( 10 per arm ) month propose 4-month recruitment period . If recruitment rate lower expect , recruitment period extend . - Individuals intervention group program service base intake ongoing evaluation use interRAI SingaPACE assessment team . Services include integrated available mix : - Case management across continuum care - Medical care SingaPACE physician - Home nursing ( e.g. , administer parenteral medication , wound care , assessment health status , nutrition ) - Home care ( e.g. , assistance ADL ) - Physiotherapy - Occupational therapy - Psychosocial care counsel social worker - Transportation care support service - Emergency housing bed - public hospital acute bed substitution 24 hour doctor / nurse phone coverageIf individual intervention group leave SingaPACE program , still continue tracked part intention-to-treat analysis . Patients die 36 month count drop out . While program new replacement patient die , new participant count part intervention group research study . - Individuals randomize control arm refer medical social worker referral community service usual . The control group interview medical history , healthcare utilization expenditure data . The data collect complement data may make available VWO providing home community care control group . Such VWO data may possibly include assessment use RAF . If participant control group switch VWO community care program another VWO community care program , still continue track included intention-to-treat analysis . For participant die period study , count loss follow-up . The control group receive community care service refer SGH MSW : - VWO community care - GPs - Polyclinics - Specialist Outpatient Clinics - Traditional Chinese Medicine herbal treatment - Supportive care arrangement family , relatives friend - All participant track 36-month period start August 2011 . Following US PACE impact evaluation 1998 observation patient make begin intervention follow 6 month interval ( Chatterji et al . 1998 ; Irvin , Massey Dorsey 1997 ; White , Abel Kidder , 2000 ) . Analysis The main outcome measure number EMT event , A &amp; E event acute care event 36 month period . This primary endpoint . The secondary endpoint study time first admission nursing home 36 month period , LOS A &amp; E ; LOS acute care ; patient QOL satisfaction care ; monthly utilization cost ; healthcare expenditure ( out-of-pocket ) financing ; caregiver satisfaction / well . There unadjusted adjust measure . For time first admission nursing home , survival analysis specifically Cox Proportional Hazards regression intention-to-treat analysis carry . Since study track participant period 36 month , first potential concern participant control group may lose follow-up 6 month discharge MSW close care management file patient . After 6 month , control group may various reason cease receive community care unless VWO program care management . To minimize difficulty , available coordinate care management VWOs Bukit Merah catchment area provide list name control group oversight . Should participants drop community care program , care coordinator assist enrol old adult another care program participant decide / would like continue care program . Statistical justification mean data analyze interpret For hypothesis test , H03 : Frail elderly SingaPACE delay first admission institutionalize residential care nursing home relative frail elderly SingaPACE , survival analysis carry . Shoenfeld 's formula give total number first nursing home admission necessary achieve 80 % power function hazard ratio 32/ ( log HR ) 2 . Assuming hazard ratio 0.35 , along first admission probability 20 % 50 % SingaPACE non-SingaPACE group respectively , approximately 28 total admission therefore total participant ( 40 group ) need . For hypothesis H01 : The elderly SingaPACE tend few admission accident &amp; emergency ( A &amp; E ) hospitalization elderly SingaPACE ; H02 : The elderly SingaPACE few admission acute care hospitalization elderly SingaPACE ; H04 : The elderly SingaPACE client enhance QOL satisfaction compare elderly SingaPACE ; H05 : Caregivers elderly SingaPACE low care-giving burden compare caregiver elderly SingaPACE , Wilcoxon rank sum test carry . Assuming observation one group exceed observation group least 55 % time , test great 80 % power detect difference group . The analytical strategy consist hypothesis test five individual hypothesis intention-to-treat analysis . Also examination distribution main outcome across participant arm 36 month . This complement meta-analysis effectiveness PACE program US Singapore .</detailed_description>
