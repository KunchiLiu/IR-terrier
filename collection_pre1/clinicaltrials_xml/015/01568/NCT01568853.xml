	<brief_title>A Prospective Study The Complement Depletion Patients With Severe Abdominal Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe abdominal sepsis remain significant cause death patient undergo intra-abdominal infection , despite recent decline overall mortality . There abundant evidence suggest complement activation sepsis . While great interest complement by-product human sepsis , study focus persistent consumption complement component role prognosis sepsis . Complement C3 indispensable community pathway complement activation . In way , alteration C3 level affect whole status complement biological function . In clinical practice , severe abdominal sepsis would develop compromise immune function intra-abdominal infection well control . The down-regulated T- B-cell immune response sepsis correlate decrease immune defense . To knowledge , human data investigate relationship complement depletion adaptive immunity severe abdominal sepsis . The investigator hypothesize complement C3 depletion sepsis strong association down-regulated adaptive immunity regard essential risk factor predict prognosis critical illness . The purpose prospective study two-fold . First , investigator observe , cohort patient severe abdominal sepsis , level complement component percentage T cell subset admission evaluate relationship complement system adaptive immunity . Second , investigator also evaluate application C3 related-indexes ( C3 , C3a , Factor H , DAF , etc . ) patient undergo severe abdominal sepsis develop alternative model predict prognosis .</detailed_description>
