	<brief_summary>Background : - The way body burns calorie know energy expenditure . Some study show cold , burn calorie keep body warm . Brown fat special kind fat use energy keep body warm . Small animal infant know brown fat many year . Recently , suggest adult human also brown fat . If brown fat becomes active ( burns calorie ) adult human expose cold , people would tend burn calorie might gain weight easily . Learning relationship energy expenditure , brown fat , environmental temperature , body temperature may help explain people become obese people . Objectives : - To good understand body burn calorie expose different temperature . - To study brown fat burn calorie cold temperature . Eligibility : - Healthy men 18 35 55 75 year age . - Healthy woman 18 35 year age . - To control ethnicity , participant must non-Hispanic white African Americans . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants stay Metabolic Unit National Institutes Health Clinical Center inpatients 14 day . The length hospital stay depend participant respond different study temperature . - Every afternoon , participant walk 30 minute treadmill . All meal provide . - Participants stay 5 hour per day specialized room different temperature setting . Temperatures range 61 degree 88 degree Fahrenheit . Body temperature , activity , calorie burning , cold/hot sensation monitor . On study day cold temperature , participant image study look brown fat activity . - Participants compensate time participation end study ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure Responses Different Temperatures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surprisingly little understood body regulate heat production ( energy expenditure , EE ) response subtle change environmental temperature . For example , recently realize brown adipose tissue functional adult human . It plausible mechanism govern heat production contribute regulation body weight thus may contribute current obesity epidemic : even small change EE , compensate change food intake , long-term effect body weight . The thermoneutral zone ( TNZ ) environmental temperature range EE minimum change environmental temperature . The low upper critical temperature define temperature limit TNZ . At environmental temperature low critical temperature , EE vs. environmental temperature graph report straight line extrapolate X-axis intercept defend body temperature . Some parameter predict different obese compare lean individual . With global obesity epidemic coinciding improve indoor temperature control , good understand relationship EE thermoregulation desirable . This protocol three phase . The first pilot lean male optimize procedure establish feasibility , sensitivity , behavior assay . Second , lean obese male cohort compare ensure expect difference observe . Third , additional variable examine , age , race , sex , menstrual phase woman . Specifically , map rest EE response environmental temperature 16-31 degree Celsius inpatient stay NIH Metabolic Clinical Research Unit . Each day rest EE measure room respiration calorimeter different environmental temperature ( subject blind room temperature ) . The remainder study day spend 23-25 degree Celsius individual patient room . Standard diet physical activity maintain body weight hold stable . Additionally core body skin temperature , heart rate variability , muscle activity surface electromyography , thermal comfort hunger use visual analog scale measure . This study establish technique provide baseline normative data , allow insight mechanism regulate EE human affect obesity . It envision study provide basis investigation effect acute chronic weight change effect drug therapy .</detailed_description>
