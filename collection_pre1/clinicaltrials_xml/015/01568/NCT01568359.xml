	<brief_title>Calcium Homeostasis Acromegaly : Effect Surgical/Medical Treatment Comparison With Nonfunctioning Pituitary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcitriol active form vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) secrete parathyroid gland neck . Both chemical responsible keep level calcium phosphorous normal also play role bone health . They measure blood . In disorder , PTH calcitriol level elevate , result increase calcium absorption gut , increase calcium bloodstream , increase calcium excretion urine . Increased calcium urine lead development kidney stone . Increased calcium bloodstream adverse effect heart , gut , kidney , bone . Acromegaly condition pituitary tumor secretes excessive amount growth hormone . Patients acromegaly find high prevalence kidney stone , urinary calcium , serum calcium compare normal adult . The reason unknown suggest mechanism growth hormone stimulate production calcitriol PTH . If true , treatment acromegaly result low growth hormone level also result low blood urine calcium level . The investigator want see patient acromegaly high calcitriol , vitamin D bind protein , PTH level see change treatment condition . The investigator also want assess amount calcium urine , treatment . Patients acromegaly may disorder bone health . The reason unknown suggest mechanism growth hormone affect bone remodeling . The investigator want see patient acromegaly abnormal bone marker , specifically PINP , CTX , TRAP , see change treatment condition . In order see result specific patient acromegaly , investigator also want check level patient acromegaly , `` nonfunctioning '' pituitary tumor . A nonfunctioning pituitary tumor one secrete excessive hormone bloodstream . The specific aim study : 1 . To describe baseline calcitriol/PTH status patient uncontrolled acromegaly . 2 . To assess change calcitriol/PTH level treatment acromegaly ( surgical medical ) . 3 . To evaluate calcium calcitriol/PTH level patient acromegaly compare patient nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma . This voluntary study . Adult patient diagnosis acromegaly clinically nonfunctioning pituitary tumor receive treatment Emory University Pituitary center give opportunity enroll study . Those agree participate need give write informed consent . Approximately 3 tablespoon ( 44ml ) blood drawn enrollment test vitamin D status parathyroid hormone . If patient already undergo blood draw standard laboratory test , volume 44ml blood obtain time order avoid additional needle stick . In addition , 24-hour urine collection obtain assess amount calcium present urine . Please note medical surgical therapy pituitary condition determine endocrinologist and/or neurosurgeon part research study . Within 6 month treatment pituitary treatment initiate , patient return Emory University pituitary clinic routine visit , laboratory data ( vitamin D parathyroid hormone ) repeat urine study ( 24 hour urine collection ) collect . The confidentiality respect encounter . No personal identifier disclose publication . Hard copy data keep securely lock office building limit access electronic data always password protected access available study personnel . If abnormal result discover part test do study , result release patient 's primary physician . All patient undergo standard therapy pituitary disorder . Results study may important implication future study design evaluate mechanism growth hormone may increase calcitriol level .</detailed_description>
