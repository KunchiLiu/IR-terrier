	<brief_summary>Statins class drug highly effective lower cholesterol level . However , compliance often limit symptom muscle pain . The investigator would like study Vitamin-D deficient individual also muscle pain due statin use . About 1 billion people estimate low insufficient level vitamin D worldwide . Patients low insufficient level vitamin D may develop muscle disease . The purpose study identify symptom associate vitamin D deficiency , importantly , treatment vitamin D deficiency reduce muscle pain cause statin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Treatment Vitamin D Deficiency Associated With Resolution Statin-Induced Muscular Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D2 ( Ergocalciferol ) approve FDA treat Vitamin D deficiency give accord approved labeling . This drug systematically study test potential benefit Vitamin D patient suffer statin-induced muscle pain . Vitamin D2 current standard care treat vitamin D deficiency . Since investigator use Vitamin D2 therapy treat vitamin D deficiency , trial pilot study , data submit FDA consideration change label indication Vitamin D2 therapy . This randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot study perform CSMC . 40 female moderate severe myopathic pain Simvastatin enrol study randomize 1:1 ratio . Patients approach consider alternative statin medication part clinical care address muscle pain . Participants recruit investigator ' clinic patient . The study discuss patient clinical visit treat doctor . Interested individual provide copy consent form take home review friend , family , physician . The patient may call study staff set study appointment enroll study clinical visit . A study investigator discus study patient ask patient read consent . The investigator encourage patient ask question discuss concern might . If consent investigator also patient 's treating doctor , consent investigator request study coordinator approach patient determine patient 's interest study order avoid conflict interest . The coordinator explicitly tell patient patient 's participation study completely voluntary patient 's medical care affect choose participate . Participation study approximately 8 week . 20 participant randomized treatment group 20 placebo group . The treatment group receive Vitamin D2 therapy 50,000 IU 8 week ( per week ) placebo group receive placebo pill ( per week ) identical nature . Participants 2 study visit respectively Week 0 Week 8 , 1 phone follow-up visit Week 1 . In addition administration Vitamin D2 placebo mention , study procedure include informed consent , physical exam , questionnaire ( brief pain assessment , SF-12 ass limitation physical activity ) , review medical record , medication supplement review , blood draw , phone followup . Subjects ask stop supplemental Vitamin D therapy maintain equal dose within patient Vitamin D2 placebo group . Prior randomization , statin medication change Simvastatin Atorvastatin patient follow telephone Week 1 tolerability new statin medication . When patient intolerant particular statin , standard care attempt another statin medication . Typically , many choose atorvastatin since low dose drug use obtain target LDL/HDL , low dos reduce risk toxicity . This change medication would preform regardless research protocol . Since statin switch low dose , possible confounding factor , however , even placebo group switch alternate statin , reduce difference two group . In addition , Atorvastatin also metabolize CYP3A4 enzyme , presume mechanism association vitamin D deficiency statin-induced myopathic pain pivot enzyme , investigator want choose statin continue utilize enzyme . But , reason state , Atorvastatin less myopathic symptom due low dos use . At conclusion study , treatment group whose serum 25 OH D level reach &gt; 30ng/mL ( therapeutic ) may continue maintenance dos ergocalciferol ( 1,000 Units/day ) receive clinical benefit . For whose 25 OH D level &lt; 30ng/mL , regardless whether receive clinical benefit treatment arm , offer repeat 8 week course Ergocalciferol therapy 50,000 Units/week standard care . It patient accept decline therapy .</detailed_description>
