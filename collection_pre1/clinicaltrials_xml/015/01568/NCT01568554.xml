	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether focused questionnaire laboratory test well define risk factor associate possible genetic porphyria . The investigator hypothesize genetic carrier state acute porphyria distinctive enough Genetic Carrier Profile investigator devise study useful identify carrier genetic porphyria among large population undiagnosed abdominal pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Diagnosis Acute Porphyria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The porphyria group genetic disease cause disturbance formation heme , essential component hemoglobin protein , lead either acute ( neurologic ) and/or chronic ( cutaneous ) symptom . Acute porphyria often difficult diagnose symptom may specific , unless patient active attack , laboratory value typically may useful diagnose porphyria . The purpose study test whether focused questionnaire laboratory evaluation tool well define risk factor associate possible genetic porphyria . The goal study : - To determine presence number abnormal lab test porphyria-like symptom adult family member first person family diagnose disease acute porphyria , 50 % expect carry genetic defect index case . - To devise Genetic Carrie Profile could use screen people diagnosis porphyria consider . - To test Profile patient symptoms suggestive HCP and/or urine test show elevation porphyrin . - To explain possible cause minor increase porphyrin level patient recurrent abdominal pain diagnose porphyria</detailed_description>
