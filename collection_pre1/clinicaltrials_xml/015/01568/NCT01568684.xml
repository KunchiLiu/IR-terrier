	<brief_summary>Background : - Antidepressants help many people depression , however , seem benefit much . Currently , possible determine improve certain antidepressant . Studies show gene may influence whether antidepressant work individual . Other study show depressed people tend low level chemical call glutamate part brain , glutamate level increase recover depression . Researchers want study antidepressant citalopram ( Celexa ) see affect glutamate level brain . They also want study person gene affect response treatment . Objectives : - To see whether glutamate level certain gene affect person responds particular antidepressant medication . Eligibility : - Individuals 25 55 year age diagnose major depression ( without psychotic feature ) . Participants may try three antidepressant treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They answer question mood current feeling depression , well family history depression . Blood urine sample collect . - This study two phase . The first phase may last 7 week depend current antidepressant use involve one seven outpatient visit . The second phase last 8 week involve five outpatient visit , one every 2 week . - In first phase , participant stop take current antidepressant medication least 2 week next phase study . Participants fluoxetine ( Prozac ) need 6 week . - At end phase , participant brain imaging study look brain function chemistry . - In second phase , participant take citalopram standard dose . They answer question mood response medication . They also provide blood saliva sample test . - At end phase , participant brain imaging study look brain function chemistry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) serious , debilitate , life-shortening illness affect many person age background . Although many patient suffer MDD expect improvement antidepressant treatment , minority experience full remission , little known basis individual difference treatment outcome . The rationale study follow finding treatment response major depression associate : 1 ) variation gene encode serotonin 2A receptor ( HTR2A ) KA1 subunit glutamate-kainate receptor ( GRIK4 ) ; 2 ) increase prefrontal glutamate/glutamine ( glx ) concentration measure [ +H ] magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . The central hypothesis gene associate citalopram treatment outcome modulate glutamate concentration prefrontal brain ( PFB ) thus facilitate response citalopram treatment . Such information important would ultimately allow development good treatment MDD . Study population : A total 104 moderate severe MDD outpatient age 25-55 baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) score great equal to18 meet DSM-IV criterion non-psychotic major depressive disorder ( MDD ) enrol course study . Design : Subjects screen on-site research psychiatric evaluation use structure interview ( MINI plus ) . After screen , participant provide DNA sample , analyzed determine patient genotype several relevant locus . All patient complete eight-week period citalopram treatment , time evaluate bi-weekly self-report questionnaire clinician rating determine change MDD symptom . Participants also undergo pre- post-treatment MRS scan determine glutamate concentration prefrontal brain . Treatment outcome measure : The Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician-Rated ( QIDS-C16 ) primary clinical outcome measure collect baseline treatment visit . Additionally , level glutamate prefrontal region brain measure MRS. Clinical response define decrease 50 percent great QIDS-C16 score baseline , remission define QIDS-C16 score less 6 . This proposal part K99 training grant undergone extensive external review ( K99MH085098-01A2 ) .</detailed_description>
