	<brief_summary>Background : - Imetelstat cancer treatment drug may slow stop tumor growth . It may also prevent tumor spread part body . Researchers want see safe effective treatment child solid tumor lymphoma respond treatment . Objectives : - To see imetelstat safe effective treatment child solid tumor lymphoma respond treatment . Eligibility : - Children adolescents 1 21 year age solid tumor lymphoma respond treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , image study . Blood urine sample also collect . - Participants receive imetelstat first eighth day 21-day cycle treatment . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . Tumor biopsy may also perform . - Participants keep take study drug total 18 cycle long disease progress severe side effect ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imetelstat Children With Refractory Recurrent Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Telomerase enzyme play critical role maintain telomere , specialize structure end chromosome involve replication stability chromosome . Inhibition telomeres cause length telomere shorten , cell become either senescent undergoes apoptosis . - In vitro vivo study demonstrate imetelstat , telomerase inhibitor , inhibits primary tumor growth prevent metastasis ; six Phase 1 study adult demonstrate reasonable toxicity profile hematologic toxicity primary cause dose limit toxicity . - Objective response observe repeated dose imetelstat administer combination bortezomib patient multiple myeloma , paclitaxel bevacizumab patient advance breast cancer , paclitaxel plus carboplatin patient advance NSCLC . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives : - To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose imetelstat administer 2-hour intravenous infusion , weekly X 2 , every 21 day , child refractory recurrent solid tumor . - To define describe toxicity imetelstat administer schedule . - To characterize pharmacokinetics imetelstat child recurrent refractory solid tumor . Secondary Objectives : - To preliminarily define antitumor effect imetelstat assess biological activity assess telomerase activity , telomere length , hTERT protein , hTERT mRNA hTR level patient PBMNC sample pretreatment treatment , assess telomerase activity , hTERT expression hTERT protein , telomere length , hTERT mRNA hTR level patient 's pretreatment tumor sample . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients &gt; 12 month less equal 21 year age recurrent refractory solid tumor , include lymphoma , without CNS tumor know CNS metastasis , adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal cardiac status . Must meet safety laboratory testing level . DESIGN : - In phase I study , maximum tolerate dose imetelstat determine use roll 6 design minimum 2 evaluable patient enter 4 dose level , imetelstat administer intravenously two hour Day 1 8 21-day cycle child recurrent refractory solid tumor , 17 cycle , total duration therapy 18 cycle ( approximately 12 month ) . - Premedication acetaminophen diphenhydramine administer prior dose ; anaphylactic precaution adhere , steroid may use symptom control premedication first dose . Doses subsequent first dose may delay withheld toxicity . This study include require pharmacokinetic component , one optional PK draw 48 hour first dose ( Day 1 , Cycle 1 ) . Patients ask participate optional blood tissue correlative biology study . Radiology study undergo central radiology review . - Once MTD define , 12 additional patient relapsed/refractory solid tumor , include CNS tumor lymphomas , may enrol acquire additional PK data recommend phase 2 dose , attempt enroll least 6 patient &lt; 12 year age . With maximum number patient 45 , study anticipate complete within 22 25 month . Up 5 patient enrol NCI .</detailed_description>
