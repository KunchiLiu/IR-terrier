	<brief_summary>Microvascular coronary dysfunction ( MCD ) ( abnormities small blood vessels/arteries heart ) symptoms persistent chest pain impact woman . There estimate 2-3 million woman US MCD 100,000 new case annually . Autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) part central nervous system help people adapt change environment . It control normally involuntary activity , heart rate , respiration ( breathe ) , body temperature , blood pressure , urinary function . However , limit understanding role ANS MCD . This research propose investigate cardiovascular reactivity mental stress cardiac ( heart ) nervous system woman MCD use mental stress testing , peripheral vascular testing , advance cardiac imaging cardiac autonomic function test . 100 participant recruit next five year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There three group study : 40 MCD subject abnormal coronary reactivity testing ( CRT ) , 20 CSX subject symptoms nomral stress testing , 40 normal control . Normal control complete two study visit MCD subject may three study visit . Recruiting participant Protocol 14906 : To date , participant Protocol 14906 complete study yet . All participant currently enrol 14906 approached investigator next study visit . Prospectively new participant approach consented 14906 . Recruiting participant Protocol 11753 : Participants currently enrol Protocol 11753 approach next study visit . Prospectively new participant approach consented 11753 . Research staff may also identify past patient complete 11753 fulfill requirement healthy individual . All participant ask undergo research procedure include mental stress task , heart rate variability , cold pressor testing , peripheral arterial tonometry . These procedure describe visit : VISIT ONE : MENTAL STRESS TESTING Mental Stress Testing use study happens heart rate , blood pressure , heart rhythm , blood vessel arm hand participant stressful situation . It take 3 hour complete procedure mental stress test include follow specific procedure : In Mental Stress Tasks , different type stress testing , include speech task situation make participant upset angry , and/or math test involve add subtract number specific constraint , and/or memory test , administer study effect stress heart ; In Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) , participant ask wear Holter monitor measure heart rate rhythm approximately 24 hour ; In Cold Pressor Testing , participant ' heart rate , blood pressure , heart rhythm , blood vessel monitor ; In Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( PAT ) , blood pressure cuff place one arm probe place participant ' finger . The probes cuff attach monitoring device transfer waveform graph participant ' pulse . Then blood pressure cuff inflate 5 minute . At end 5-minute period , blood pressure cuff deflate get final tracing . RESPERATE BREATHING TRIAL In subject MCD , know whether controlled breathe relaxation technique use FDA-approved pace breathe device , RESPeRATE , help chest pain shortness breath test see form biofeedback relaxation technique help heart rate variability mental stress , MCD subject randomize complete RESPeRATE breathe trial perform choice relaxation technique 8 week . VISIT TWO : SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ( SPECT ) CARDIAC SCAN WITH 123I-MIBG AND MYOVIEW Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) cardiac scan 123I-mIBG Myoview use measure cardiac sympathetic activity . The test take approximately 5 hour approximately 3.5 hour break middle . VISIT THREE : REPEATED MENTAL STRESS TESTING Only subject MCD visit take 3 hour complete . During visit , MCD subject ask complete repeat Mental Stress Testing , include Mental Stress Tasks , Holter Heart Rate Variability , PAT test outline All procedure research-related . Participants may consent procedure due current limited funding . There collaboration site .</detailed_description>
