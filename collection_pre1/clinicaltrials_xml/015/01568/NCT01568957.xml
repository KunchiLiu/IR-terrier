	<brief_summary>Community ambulation highly complex skill require ability adapt increase environmental complexity perform multiple task simultaneously . Deficits dual-tasking may severely compromise ability participate fully community living . Unfortunately , current rehabilitation practice stroke fails adequately address dual-task limitation ; individual stroke continue exhibit clinically significant dual-task cost gait discharge . As result , many stroke survivor live community residual deficit may increase disability real world lead fall devastating consequence . To address issue , propose study investigate efficacy dual-task gait training attention allocation locomotor performance community-dwelling stroke survivor . Because walk real world often require time-critical task obstacle avoidance , investigator test impact dual-task gait train cognitive-motor interference walking prefer speed maximal speed ( Aim 1 ) , locomotor control obstacle negotiation ( Aim 2 ) . The investigator also evaluate effect intervention community reintegration participation ( Aim 3 ) .</brief_summary>
