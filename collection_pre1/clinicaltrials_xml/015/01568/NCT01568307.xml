	<brief_summary>There strong evidence patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) increase risk develop coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . This elevated risk independent standard risk factor smoke , obesity , high cholesterol , diabetes , high blood pressure . The relative risk develop CHD proportional severity depression ( severe depression , likely development CHD ) . The sympathetic nervous system ( part nervous system make heart beat harder faster ) responsible `` flight fight '' response threaten situation . It determine increase sympathetic nervous system activation occur approximately one three untreated patient MDD ( underlie CHD ) . There grow evidence link elevate sympathetic activity early stage kidney dysfunction increase incidence cardiovascular ( heart blood vessel ) disease development ( eg , heart attack ) . Sympathetic nervous system activation prolong period time may also associate abnormal blood pressure regulation development insulin resistance ( important feature type 2 diabetes ) . It suggest certain gene , know serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) gene , may involve . In particular , work group indicate particular type gene , short form ( `` short '' allele ) may important link MDD , sympathetic nervous activation , increase cardiac risk . This study aim examine role 5-HTT gene cardiovascular risk factor associate elevated sympathetic activity patient MDD . Additionally , study examine effect serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) therapy parameter . A clearer understand system process allow identification patient increase cardiac risk development risk reduction strategy . Such information clinically significant give link cardiovascular disease MDD . Hypothesis 1 : That MDD patient carry allele 5-HTT transporter higher sympathetic activity homozygous patient . Hypothesis 2 : MDD patient elevate sympathetic activity display early sign leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) diastolic dysfunction . Hypothesis 3 : That MDD patient high sympathetic activity great morning surge blood pressure patient normal sympathetic activity . Hypothesis 4 : That MDD patient elevate sympathetic activity display early sign insulin resistance . Hypothesis 5 : That SSRI therapy , particular carry allele 5-HTT , favourable effect blood pressure variability morning surge blood pressure , sympathetic stress reactivity , marker insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
