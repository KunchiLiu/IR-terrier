	<brief_summary>Background : - Gum disease condition tissue around tooth root become swollen infect . This condition cause tooth loss treat . Who get gum disease bad depend ( 1 ) different bacteria mouth ( 2 ) immune system individual handle bacteria . Researchers want look oral bacteria genetic immune problem different people learn affect gum disease condition mouth . Objectives : - To study immune system problem may lead problem mouth , include gum disease . Eligibility : - Children adult least 7 year age genetic problem immune system . - Healthy adult periodontal disease - Health adult periodontal disease Design : - This study involve screen visit study visit . - Participants screen medical history , blood work full oral dental exam , include dental x-rays photo . - The study visit involve collection blood , urine , sample , include saliva , plaque , gum swab . Any abnormal tissue sample biopsy . Additional oral dental exam perform . Participants also answer question current medical dental problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol cross sectional study design investigate clinical , microbiologic , immunologic consequence immune dysfunction ( particularly dysfunction due primary immune defect ) oral cavity . The hypothesis systemic immune dysfunction , attribute monogenic immune defect population interest , lead alteration local immune response microbial colonization ultimately predispose susceptibility oral infection inflammatory condition . Of particular interest protocol susceptibility select patient population immune dysfunction periodontal disease . Whereas patient hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome ( HIES ) important focus research , enrollment open broad population , include monogenic immune defect leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 ( LAD-1 ) , chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , well patient defect cytokine signal . For inclusion study , ID subject must current diagnosis primary immune defect , enrol NIH protocol follow medical issue require get dental consult . Data dental consult , collect parent protocol , analyze protocol ass type extent oral manifestation patient immune defect . In addition information collect part consult , subject undergo sample oral fluid , microbe , blood sampling . Each patient subject 18 year age old also undergo oral biopsy . Systemically healthy volunteer subject screen classify with/without periodontitis . Healthy volunteer clinically evaluate enrolled single visit , undergo oral fluid/microbe/tissue/blood sampling/oral biopsy research purpose . The primary aim protocol use modern methodology characterize immune response microbial colonization oral cavity health patient primary immune defect . By particularly study subject monogenic immune defect , aim increase understand role specific immune molecule pathway balance host/microbial interaction mucosal surface oral cavity .</detailed_description>
