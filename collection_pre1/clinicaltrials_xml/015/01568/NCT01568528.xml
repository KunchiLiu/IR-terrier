	<brief_summary>The focus current project advance understanding effect oxytocin ( OT ) components social cognition schizophrenia ( SCZ ) . Despite rapid increase understanding role OT rodent model social behavior explosion interest prosocial effect OT healthy control , little work do dissect potential effect OT SCZ subject social deficit . Social deficits crucial aspect functional impairment limit rehabilitation patient SCZ . In particular , SCZ patient endure negative symptom ( deficit syndrome , Kirkpatrick et al . 1989 ) prominent social deficit core feature subtype illness . Our currently available medication little improve social deficit . Hence utmost public health importance address knowledge gap regard potential OT improve social function illness . Intact social function depend competent function several cognitive domain subserve perception social cue generation motivate social behavior . We propose conduct pharmacological challenge study OT vs. placebo administration study effect OT specific component social cognition male deficit syndrome SCZ subject . Primary Hypothesis : Intranasal OT improve social cognition subject deficit syndrome SCZ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Administer OT intranasally vs. placebo parallel group double-blind design 40 deficit syndrome SCZ subject . Following OT placebo ( PBO ) dosing , component social cognition assess follow . 1 . Evaluate salience social cue measurement visual scan path gaze picture face . 2 . Evaluate sensitivity social reward mean computerize social reward ball-tossing task assay social interaction response social reward . 3 . Evaluate social cognition mean test ability correctly identify emotion picture face ( Facial Emotion Identification Test , FEIT ) . BACKGROUND Impaired social functioning important symptom SCZ SCZ chronic severe psychotic illness affect two three million Americans , 100,000 veteran ( Owen et al . 2004 ) . There several key symptom domain characterize illness . Positive symptom ( hallucination delusion ) least somewhat responsive antipsychotic medication majority patient . Negative symptom poor motivation , anhedonia , poor social function , poor occupational function poorly responsive medication currently available treatment . The deficit syndrome define complex negative symptom endure throughout course schizophrenia patient 's disease ( Kirkpatrick et al . 1989 ) . The social impairment see patient core deficit link poor functional outcome ( Couture et al . 2006 ; Fett et al . 2011 ) . Furthermore , deficits social cognition propose underlie contribute significantly impaired social functioning ( Kern et al . 2008 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . An underlying hypothesis work social cognition could effectively treat , patient would improve social functional outcome , potentially enable achieve occupational competence , sustain stable independent living , lead fulfilling independent life . Thus understanding treatment social impairment SCZ important public health perspective . OT effect social cognition behavior Studies rodent demonstrate critical role neuropeptide OT social bonding ( Young et al . 2005 ) . A large rapidly grow translational literature indicate neuropeptide may also play prosocial role human behavior . The prosocial effect OT administration already extensively review literature ( Striepens N et al. , 2011 ) . In area trust altruism , study utilize variety economic cooperation paradigm indicate OT enhances trust social cooperation ( Baumgartner T et al. , 2008 ; De Dreu CK et al. , 2010 ; Declerck CH et al. , 2010 ; Kosfeld M et al. , 2005 ; Mikolajczak M et al. , 2010 ; Zak PJ et al. , 2007 ) . Feelings empathy others enhance OT three study ( Domes et al . 2007 ; Bartz et al . 2010 ; Hurlemann et al . 2010 ) . Several study indicate OT increase ability healthy control identify emotion face ( Di Simplicio et al . 2009 ; Fischer-Shofty et al . 2010 , Marsh et al . 2010 ) . There report use memory paradigm , OT administration induce enhanced recall face OT ( Savaskan et al . 2008 ; Rimmele et al . 2009 ) , although early study find improvement ( Ferrier et al . 1980 ) . OT administration also increase recall social word ( Unkelbach et al . 2008 ) . There indication OT effect recall specific emotional stimulus since several study healthy control find OT improve memory nonsocial stimulus ( Bruins J et al. , 1992 ; Fehm-Wolfsdorf G et al. , 1984 ; Geenen V et al. , 1988 ; Kennett DJ et al. , 1982 ) . OT potential treatment SCZ Several line reason suggest OT could helpful adjunct treatment SCZ . 1 . Patients SCZ alter OT level compare healthy control ( Linkowski et al . 1984 ; Beckmann et al . 1985 ; Legros et al . 1992 ; Goldman et al . 2008 ; Keri et al . 2009 ) . 2. fMRI concert intranasal OT administration associate reduce blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation amygdala presentation fearful/threatening face scene ( Kirsch et al . 2005 ) . This study give indirect support idea OT may ameliorate paranoia patient SCZ . 3 . The negative symptom SCZ include social isolation , autism , amotivation social engagement . There face validity notion OT could help symptoms virtue pro-social action . 4 . To date three publish placebo control trial OT SCZ . In first study , OT give placebo-controlled double-blind randomize crossover design ( Feifel et al . 2010 ) . In study fifteen completers , Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) use outcome measure . OT add antipsychotic treatment result significant improvement positive symptom , measure PANSS total score , PANSS positive symptom subscale , PANSS negative symptom subscale , CGI . The effect size change range 0.40 PANSS positive symptom 0.74 CGI . Furthermore , treatment OT well tolerate , significant difference OT placebo rate adverse effect blood chemistry ( Feifel et al . 2010 ) . This group publish second paper indicate improvement verbal memory SCZ subject follow three week twice daily OT ( Feifel et al . 2012 ) . The third study report two week OT reduce psychotic symptom improve performance Theory Mind task ( Pedersen et al . 2011 ) . Dissecting component social impairment SCZ Intact social competence depend adequate function several cognitive domain subserve perception social cue motivate social behavior . We propose interrogate composite domain administration OT vs. placebo project . . Eye track . Relevant social cue must sufficient salience command attention . This aspect social cognition investigate mean visual scan path paradigm quantify amount time subject spend look eye mouth region picture face present position eye track . The amount eye gaze predictive subject 's ability correctly identify emotion mean others ( Haxby et al . 2002 ) . A single dose OT significantly increase amount eye gaze healthy control ( Guastella et al . 2008a ) high function subject autism spectrum disorder ( Andari et al . 2010 ) . SCZ subject abnormality visual scan path view picture face ( Phillips David 1997 ; Loughland et al . 2002a ) . Thus hypothesize OT increase gaze eye subject deficit syndrome SCZ ( Specific Aim 2a ) . ii . Social Reward Ball-Tossing Task . Social stimulus must sufficiently reward motivate decision-making behavior . This aspect social function investigate computerized social interaction game assay effect social reinforcement decision-making . In task develop Andari et al . ( 2010 ) derive earlier task Williams et al . ( 2000 ) , subject engage computerized version ball-toss game three fictional partner vary proportion time throw ball back subject . The outcome measure interest choice make subject regard fictional player would throw ball . In study high function autism spectrum subject , OT administration selectively enhance return ball socially cooperative fictional partner ( Andari et al . 2010 ) . This result interpret evidence OT enhance appropriate behavioral response social reward reciprocity . We hypothesize OT administration enhance socially reinforce behavior subject deficit syndrome SCZ ( Specific Aim 2b ) . iii . Facial Emotion Identification Task ( FEIT ) . The socially competent person must able correctly identify emotion others order respond appropriately social communication . The correct identification emotion others key aspect social cognition link functional outcome SCZ ( Couture et al . 2006 ) . This aspect social cognition investigate paradigms query subject identify emotion display picture . Most study literature report patient SCZ deficient correct identification emotion display picture face ( Addington et al . 2006 ; Bigelow et al . 2006 ; va n't Wout et al . 2007 ; Averbeck et al . 2012 see review Couture et al . 2006 ) , although study find impairment ( de Achaval et al . 2010 ) . The classic series picture face introduced Eckman Friesen ( 1976 ) use many study affect recognition , series picture also utilized ( Erwin et al . 1992 ; Kerr Neale 1993 ) . OT administration show two study increase correct identification emotion face subject SCZ ( Goldman et al . 2011 ; Averbeck et al . 2012 ) . We hypothesize deficit syndrome SCZ subject exhibit improvement facial emotion recognition administration OT ( Specific Aim 2c ) .</detailed_description>
