	<brief_summary>Decitabine report clinically significant , often long lasting effect platelet count myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . It also report decitabine could increase platelet count enhance megakaryocyte maturation platelet release . Immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) know immune-mediated acquired disease characterize transient persistent decrease platelet count . However , refractory ITP lack effective treatment efficacy decitabine ITP remain poorly understood . Data study may provide idea decitabine treatment ITP .</brief_summary>
