	<brief_summary>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) relate symptoms common condition affect nearly half men age 50 90 % men 80 . Lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) cause BPH troublesome , affect individual 's quality life significantly , costly . Phase 2 clinical research trial double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study compare treatment effect onaBoNT-A 200 U versus 0.4 mg per day oral tamsulosin male Veterans diagnose moderate severe LUTS [ American Urologic Association Symptom Score ( AUASS ) equal great 8 ] associate BPH . A total 74 volunteer recruit participate clinical trial . Volunteers include male great 50 year age diagnose LUTS associate BPH . They Veterans visit Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Houston ( MEDVAMC ) . There eligibility restriction race ethnicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness onaBoNT-A v Oral Tamsulosin Men With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Lower Urinary Track Symptoms ( BPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This propose intervention first randomize clinical trial compare effect onaBoNT-A prostate injection versus alpha adrenergic antagonist medication LUTS associate BPH . Up point , clinical study use onaBoNT-A prostate limit patient 's refractory -1 adrenoceptor blocker therapy . The study directly compare onaBoNT-A -1 adrenoceptor blocker frontline therapy male Veteran cohort suffer moderate severe LUTS . Besides obvious efficacy patient ' refractory -1 adrenoceptor blocker therapy , onaBoNTA injection several potential advantage oral agent . Focal prostate injection show safe obviates systemic side effect observe -1 adrenoceptor blocker ( i.e . orthostatic hypotension , sexual dysfunction ) . In addition , clinical study demonstrate durable response onaBoNT-A treatment exceed 12 month . Although study modest length ( i.e . total 4 year ) , significant result could drive paradigm shift LUTS associate BPH treat , even regard frontline therapy . Although sophisticated molecular technique ( i.e . LCM Microarray Analysis ) use investigator characterize gene profile change BPH LUTS , first study examine gene profile change drug na BPH View Protocol Record patient follow treatment -1 adrenoceptor blocker Tamsulosin onaBoNT-A . This study important scant knowledge exist true mechanism -1 adrenoceptor blocker like Tamsulosin onaBoNT-A improve patient urinary tract symptom quality life . It clear , however , nerve regulate prostate growth function also account LUTS drive patient seek therapy . This investigation utilize onaBoNT-A biological tool identify potential novel mechanistic pathway future investigation push development target therapy benefit patient refractory pharmacologic treatment . Potential inflammatory pathway neural sensory signal alteration induce BPH , modify onaBoNT-A Tamsulosin improve symptom via gene profile change , explore expert laboratory Texas Medical Center . This highly collaborative project utilizing expertise across department foster translational work laboratory patient . Although primary goal study , investigator also search possible biological marker prognostic value could confirm future multi-center trial . The primary objective Phase 2 clinical research study compare efficacy 200 U onaBoNT-A injected prostate versus oral tamsulosin treatment low urinary tract symptom cause BPH male Veteran volunteer MEDVAMC . The secondary objective determine impact tamsulosin onaBoNT-A pathologic parameter RNA profile epithelium stroma BPH tissue . Volunteers randomize two group one receive ona-BoNT-A injection prostate oral placebo pill take daily group receive placebo injection oral tamsulosin pill daily . Volunteers make five clinic visit contact telephone twice .</detailed_description>
