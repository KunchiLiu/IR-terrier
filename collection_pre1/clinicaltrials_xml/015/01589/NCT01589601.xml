	<detailed_description>Heart failure currently affect 5 million Americans . Symptomatic patient median life expectancy le 5 year late-stage disease 1-year mortality rate approach 90 % . Despite recent therapeutic advance reduce morbidity mortality , heart failure continue cause enormous suffering . Patients advanced disease suffer physical effect illness , also psychosocial spiritual distress . In addition , heart failure cost $ 34 billion annually healthcare system disproportionate amount spend patient last 6 month life treatment may either ineffective undesired . Selected patient candidate aggressive treatment cardiac transplantation mechanical circulatory support , application therapy broader heart failure population limit resource scarcity untested usefulness old patient significant co-morbidities . The progressive nature heart failure couple high mortality rate poor quality life mandate great attention palliative care routine component heart failure management . Patients advanced heart failure , particularly elderly significant co-morbidities , ought ideal candidate palliative care aim relieve suffer improve quality life . Yet , several challenge limit use palliative care approach heart failure : 1 . Determination Prognosis . Several validate multivariable model develop predict survival , yet considerable uncertainty remain physician frequently unsure whether care patient near far end life . Patients even hard time typically overly optimistic survival relative observe predict multivariable model . 2 . Timing Implementation . This prognostic uncertainty highly variable disease trajectory individual patient heart failure pose challenge palliative care intervention ought implement . The appropriate time introduce palliative care concept , particularly regard end-of-life planning , remain undefined link patient prognosis preference . 3 . Untested Interventions . There limited evidence randomize controlled trial palliative care intervention heart failure majority focus resuscitation preference . Further , practice guideline major cardiovascular society limit subject . 4 . Lack Palliative Care Training Cardiovascular Specialists . The education cardiovascular specialist typically exclude formalized training principle practice palliative care . Given limitation , properly design power study require determine whether multidimensional palliative care intervention addition usual care improve health-related outcome relative usual care alone advance heart failure patient highly probable short-term mortality . PAL-HF prospective , control , unblinded , 2-arm , single-center clinical trial approximately 200 advanced heart failure patient &gt; 50 % predict 6-month mortality randomize usual , state art heart failure care usual care combine PAL-HF intervention . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either 2 treatment regimen : - Usual advanced HF care - Usual advance HF care + interdisciplinary palliative care focus symptom relief ; assessment management anxiety , depression , spiritual concern ; well advance care plan include definition care goal , resuscitation preference , participation Outlook intervention . The primary endpoint health-related quality life measure Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy Palliative Care Subscale ( FACIT-Pal ) score 6 month The duration intervention PAL-HF 6 month , patient group follow death , end study . The study complete arm trial post-death interview caregiver .</detailed_description>
