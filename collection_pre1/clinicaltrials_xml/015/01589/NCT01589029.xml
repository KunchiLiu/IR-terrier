	<brief_summary>The pilot study evaluate efficacy safety Canakinumab ( ILARIS® ) subject proliferative diabetic retinopathy secondary type 1 2 diabetes . Ten subject enrol receive 150 mg Canakinumab ( ILARIS® ) subcutaneous injection . Beginning day 0 , subject receive subcutaneous injection study drug every 8 week 16 week , total 3 injection . All subject undergo regular follow-up assessment every 8 week 24 week . Fluorescein angiography ( FA ) repeat every 8 week . In case progression retinal neovascularization FA panretinal laser photocoagulation administer rescue therapy . The primary outcome regression retinal neovascularizations ( NVE NVD ) FA 24 week . In addition key secondary outcome include regression diabetic macular edema , change best-corrected visual acuity , change HbA1c level change marker systemic inflammation . Safety assess measurement vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment , record adverse clinical event .</brief_summary>
