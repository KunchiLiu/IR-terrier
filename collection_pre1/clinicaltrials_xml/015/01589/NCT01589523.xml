	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine way ( mechanism ) defect bile acid handling ( metabolism ) cause liver disease abnormality absorption vitamin effect investigational bile acid therapy ( glycocholic acid ) vitamin absorption liver disease . An investigational therapy one approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) provide Investigational New Drug application FDA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GlycoCholic Acid Treatment Patients With Inborn Errors Bile Acid Synthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inborn error bile acid metabolism establish well recognize cause neonatal cholestasis fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption . Although extensive experience metabolic defect biosynthetic pathway , patient identify defect conjugation taurine glycine allow bile acid become effective detergent . This protocol design study effect defect conjugation bile acid growth fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption . Study subject liver function study perform , serum urinary bile acid measurement , vitamin level , growth measurement , bile acid pool size measurement make stable isotope dilution mass-spectrometry , measurement absorption two fat-soluble vitamin , tocopherol vitamin D. Subjects treat orally conjugate cholic acid follow-up laboratory perform outpatient subject initial study repeat inpatient stay 3-12 month start treatment . Subjects previous liver biopsy indicate presence significant liver disease repeat liver biopsy 3-12 month treatment assess histologic response treatment .</detailed_description>
