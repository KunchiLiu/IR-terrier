	<brief_summary>Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) frequent complication sickle cell disease diagnose finding chest x-ray one following : chest pain , fever , trouble breathing . Patients Acute Chest Syndrome get sick require exchange transfusion ( special large blood transfusion ) mechanical ventilation . Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ( BLPAP ) device blow air patient lung via mask cover nose . Our goal determine whether give child BLPAP ACS , addition provide standard clinical care ACS alters clinical course patient . The investigator hypothesize patient receive effective BLPAP milder clinical course result short hospital stay few transfer intensive care unit exchange transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) frequent complication sickle cell disease diagnose new infiltrate chest x-ray one following : chest pain , fever , respiratory sign symptom ( tachypnea , cough , new onset hypoxemia , increase work breathing . ) The treatment acute chest syndrome focus supportive care hydration , antibiotic , blood transfusion respiratory support . Unfortunately , despite treatment many patient fail improvement respiratory status , respiratory decompensation . These patient require aggressive treatment , frequently include exchange transfusion , pediatric intensive care unit ( PCCU ) management , respiratory support . Our goal perform prospective double blind randomize control trial investigate early initiation effective BLPAP addition provide standard clinical care ACS alters clinical course patient vs. sham BLPAP standard clinical care . We hypothesize patient receive effective BLPAP milder clinical course result short hospital stay few transfer PCCU exchange transfusion .</detailed_description>
