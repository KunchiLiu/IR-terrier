	<brief_summary>Pain relief open inguinal hernia repair could improve administration TAP block ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block . It unclear one work well . The investigator hypothesize TAP block closer middle abdomen would result improved pain relief due simultaneous block ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medial Versus Traditional Approach US-guided TAP Blocks Open Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , open , randomized trial . Subjects randomize use computer-generated table random number 2 group receive pre-incisional ipsilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block use classic medial approach . Group assignments seal sequentially number , opaque envelope would open anesthesiologist perform block . The research nurse , involve patient care subject sign write informed consent , provide postoperative data collection . Study subject anesthesia care provider also blind group allocation . All patient premedicated 1-2mg IV midazolam 50-150 mcg IV fentanyl . In OR , propofol infusion start 75mcg/kg/hr titrated patient comfort . After patient adequately sedate , ultrasound guide TAP block perform subject use linear 6-15MHz ultrasound probe portable ultrasound machine ( SonoSite , Bothell , WA ) . Classic approach group receive TAP block previously describe ( Hebbard P , 2007 ) . For medial approach , external oblique abdominal , internal oblique abdominal , transversus abdominal muscle visualize use ultrasound transducer costal margin iliac crest level anterior axillary line ( classic approach ) , transducer would move medially point internal oblique muscle disappears . The injection target area within 1 inch lateral point . The place needle insertion prepped Chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % antiseptic solution , 21G 90-mm StimuQuik needle ( Arrow International , Reading , PA ) use inject 20ml Ropivacaine 0.5 % proper place identify . Each subject receive local infiltration 20ml Lidocaine1 % : Bupivacaine 0.25 % 1:1 mix prior incision surgeon well 1000 mg IV acetaminophen 8 mg IV dexamethasone intraoperatively . In postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , patient ask rate pain rest upon arrival regular interval 0 10 numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , 0 mean pain 10 bad pain imaginable . Hydromorphone 0.5 mg IV administer every 5 minute maintain NRS pain score &lt; 4 10 . In case postoperative nausea vomiting , subject receive 4mg IV ondansetron , follow 12.5 mg IV Diphenhydramine necessary . The Aldrete Recovery Score use transfer patient Phase I recovery , focus provide transition totally anesthetized state one requiring less intervention . Aldrete Scoring System assess respiration , oxygen saturation , consciousness , circulation activity . Each item score 0 2 scale high score represent advanced recovery . Once score 9 high reach , subject transfer Phase II recovery , focus prepare patient dicharge . At discharge , subject instructed take combination oxycodone 5mg acetaminophen 325mg orally every 4-6 hour NRS pain score &gt; 4 10 . Postoperative opioid consumption 48 hour convert equivalent dose oral hydromorphone . Subjects contact telephone research nurse one investigator involve care , ask pain amount pain medication consume since discharge since last phone call respectively . In case potential problem , matter refer physician .</detailed_description>
