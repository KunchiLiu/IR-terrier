	<brief_summary>This study base upon follow point : 1 . Resistance trastuzumab , either primary secondary , clinically relevant issue . 2 . PI3K/AKT activation , due loss expression/function PTEN and/or activate mutation PIK3CA , mechanism resistance clinical relevance breast cancer . Such activation detect : - IHC evaluation PTEN protein expression - genotyping PIK3CA exon 9 20 - IHC evaluation phospho-AKT expression 3 . BKM120 effective PI3K inhibitor . BKM120 anti-HER2 therapy may synergistic antitumor activity preclinical model HER2+ breast cancer . 4 . Lapatinib effective anti-HER2 therapy trastuzumab-resistant disease . 5 . For evaluation novel target therapy , select patient population enrich activation target modulate allow maximize difference clinical outcome expect experimental arm , thus minimize patient number include . 6 . We propose test phase I/II study combination lapatinib BKM120 trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ MBC patient , enrich activation PI3K/AKT detect loss expression PTEN ( IHC ) , and/or mutation PIK3CA and/or overexpression phospho-AKT ( IHC ) . Only phase II patient , mutational status inclusion criterion . For phase I patient molecular status retrospective exploratory analysis .</brief_summary>
