	<brief_summary>Victims trauma severe head injury bleed brain high risk develop blood clot legs . These blood clot break travel bloodstream lung cause death . Blood thinner give patient prevent blood clot develop leave patient risk additional bleeding brain cause damage death . The early blood thinner start effective preventing blood clot patient severe head injury bleed brain develop bleed even receive blood thinner . Even though grow body research show majority bleed brain stop within first 24 hour injury safe start blood thinner early 24 hour injury , doctor still wait longer 4 day start blood thinner patient concern worsen bleeding . In Canada , almost half patient severe head injury receive blood thinner least five day injury . Delays start blood thinner appear put patient increase risk develop blood clot , unnecessarily . This study compare benefit start low-molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , type blood thinner , early ( less 48 hour ) versus current practice ( wait 5th day injure ) prevent blood clot patient bleed brain severe head injury . The investigator believe start LMWH earlier effective prevent blood clot without worsen bleed compare wait start blood thinner . This study call OPTTTICH ( Optimal Timing Thromboprophylaxis Traumatic IntraCranial Haemorrhage ) large Canadian investigator-initiated randomize control trial blood clot prevention trauma patient severe head injury bleed brain .</brief_summary>
