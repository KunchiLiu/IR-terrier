	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) disease cause bacteria infect lung . TB bacteria small living agent spread cough kill take TB drug . To kill TB bacteria TB patient take combination four drug 2 month two drug 4 month . During first 2 month patient take rifampicin , isoniazid , ethambutol , pyrazinamide . After patient take isoniazid rifampicin 4 month , make total 6 month therapy . In A5307 investigator want test new combination drug see investigator could treat TB faster future . Studies animal suggest one four drug , isoniazid , work day may need first two dos TB treatment kill TB bacteria . After effect wear point may even interfere drug . The investigator want see stop isoniazid early , use moxifloxacin , different drug , instead could treat TB faster . This study first time type regimen without isoniazid test human . If investigator could show isoniazid stop work day , investigator could try see could possibly make good tuberculosis treatment future .</brief_summary>

Willingness hospitalize approximately 3 week . Ability provide least 10mL sputum overnight collection prior study entry . NOTE : Candidates produce overnight sputum sample sufficient quality quantity consider screen failure . However , candidate 's failure produce sufficient sputum appear due poor technique rather low volume sputum production , evaluation may repeat .
