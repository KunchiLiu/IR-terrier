	<brief_summary>According publish literature , treatment pegylated interferon ( Peg-IFN ) associate end treatment response treatment naive patient chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) . It antiviral well anti-fibrotic property treatment Peg-IFN result improvement liver histology regulation progression cirrhosis liver . Peg-IFN administered finite duration . The major limitation Peg-IFN 30-49 % patient benefit anti-viral drug . Another potent anti-viral drug , entecavir ( ETV ) , hand , reduces HBV replication patient , cause improvement liver histology 30 % , possibly lack immune modulatory ability like Peg-IFN . Also , ETV treatment associate several complication like emergence HBV mutant . The aim study ass whether combination two 'unique ' anti-viral drug offer best possible outcome treatment-naïve CHB patient , term treatment response ( virological biochemical ) , treatment cost duration adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Entecavir Combination Chronic Hepatitis B ( CHB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims &amp; Objectives : Peg-IFN five unique feature , namely ( ) finite duration administration , ( ii ) anti-viral effect , ( iii ) immune-modulation , ( iv ) anti-fibrotic effect ( v ) delay virologic response off-treatment . However benefit come cost i.e . drug expensive several know adverse event . ETV potent nucleoside analogue ( Nuc ) , minimal resistance compare Nucs . It efficient induce rapid decline HBV DNA . However ETV know immune modulatory anti-fibrotic effect therefore off-treatment response improvement hepatic histology expect ETV . Similar NUCs , define duration administration ETV . It hypothesize lower-dose Peg-IFN give combination ETV treatment-naïve CHB patient , likely benefit 'best drug ' term viral biochemical response , treatment cost duration adverse event . The project aim evaluate outcome first-line combination treatment 'lower-dose Peg-IFN plus ETV ' treatment-naïve CHB patient see whether combination may evaluate eventually recommend first-line management HBV relate chronic liver disease ( CLD ) . Research Question : Although best treatment option CHB clarify yet , certain therapeutic concept derive experience treat patient chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . A major advancement treat CHC HIV infection development first-line combination therapy . The research question study whether first-line combination treatment 'lower-dose Peg-IFN plus ETV ' effective beneficial treatment-naïve CHB patient whether combination may evaluate eventually recommended prefer first-line management HBV relate CLD . Methodology : Ethical consideration Ethical approval study obtain Ethical Committee Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University . The study perform accord principle 'Declaration Helsinki ' 1975 maintain requisite norm 'good clinical practice ' ( GCP ) . This prospective , open label , interventional clinical study . The first 20 ( twenty ) treatment-naive hepatitis B virus ' e ' antigen ( HBeAg ) positive CHB patient treatment indication , present July 2011 onwards , afford treatment Peg-IFN voluntarily agree part study recruit . Signed voluntary consent Bengali obtain participant . Patients receive peg-IFN ( 90 µgms ) sub-cutaneously weekly 24 week combination ETV ( 0.5 mg ) daily orally duration . Administration Peg-IFN supervise patient evaluate regularly clinically biochemical haematological parameter early detection management adverse event ( ) . Virologic biochemical parameter test ( ) baseline , ( ii ) end treatment ( i.e . 24 week ) ( iii ) 12 week off-treatment . These include HBeAg , HBV DNA serum alaninetransaminase ( ALT ) . Besides assessment liver status , patient undergo ultrasonography ( USG ) hepato-biliary system ( HBS ) , endoscopy upper gastrointestinal tract ( UGIT ) possible liver biopsy fibroscan liver baseline . Data analysis All data collect use pre-designed questionnaire preserve safe place . Data analyse use SPSS programme .</detailed_description>
