	<brief_summary>This prospective study evaluate clinical utility novel real-time localization system allow small volume normal tissue include radiation field determine dosimetric parameter adverse effect profile radiation therapy use technology . Subjects beacon transponder implant prostate precisely localize position organ radiation therapy . Hypothesis : 1 . Treatment highly target radiation therapy deliver daily treatment time consistent routine clinical practice . 2 . Highly targeted radiation therapy reduce PTV margin result significant decrease rectal bladder volume treat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek establish clinical feasibility novel real-time localization track system use reduce PTV margin intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , allow treatment small volume normal tissue radiation therapy . Such reduction PTV margin exposure healthy tissue treatment may allow several future improvement prostate radiotherapy include : - decrease acute chronic adverse effect similar local tumor control - dose escalation achieve high cure rate similar adverse effect standard dose treatment - hypofractionation shorten time , low expense , treatment without increased adverse effect .</detailed_description>
