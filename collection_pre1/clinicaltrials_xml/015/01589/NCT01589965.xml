	<brief_summary>The HIV/AIDS epidemic major concern many country . The epidemic especially acute Lesotho roughly one quarter population infect HIV/AIDS . In Lesotho , elsewhere , new innovative approach induce safer sexual behavior desperately call , particularly view limited impact exist prevention scheme trajectory HIV/AIDS epidemic . One key question understand individual get involve short-term risky sexual behavior potential long-term cost become HIV infected high ? A follow-up question replicable feasible intervention affect trade-off short long run return ? The primary aim study evaluate whether use short-term financial incentive affect trade-off , thereby influence young individual ' decision respect sexual reproductive health behavior , thus end reduce HIV incidence rate . The investigator study question use sample population attend serve New Start Voluntary Counseling Testing ( VCT ) sit local NGO , Population Service International ( PSI ) , already implement Lesotho . The investigator propose conduct randomize control trial test whether add financial incentive remain STI-negative form lottery promote safer sexual activity . The lottery work follow : individual test negative set curable STIs , get lottery ticket chance win `` big '' prize . If test positive , receive free treatment , lottery ticket . If individual test positive cure , come back lottery system get later chance win lottery ticket remain STI-negative . The outcome measure impact financial incentive HIV incidence two year . The result research project disseminate academic non-academic conference , workshop , publication academic journal , also policy journal aim reach policy maker outside research community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Short-term Financial Incentives Sexual Behavior HIV Incidence Lesotho</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lesotho third-highest HIV prevalence world 23.2 % . Many HIV prevention initiative currently go country . The propose impact evaluation respond urgent need find innovative approach promote safer sexual behavior among youths Lesotho . In particular , project implement New Start Voluntary Counseling Testing ( VCT ) sit establish PSI country . PSI , implement agency , 5 static New Start VCT sit nationally 5 10 district Lesotho . They locate main camp town district . Each sit vehicle tent use outreach service . Outreach activity aim target specific group population generally high risk HIV infection . For example , rural peri-urban village ( within 60 km radius VCT site , work place ( garment factory , phone company , etc . ) ) school . The present randomized evaluation aim target youths rural peri-urban village . PSI Lesotho extensive experience work HIV prevention sector currently involve various HIV prevention activity , include , particular , provision VCT service condom distribution . 3 . Research objective Motivation The result traditional information campaign ( like ABC-Abstinence , Be Faithful use Condom ) sexual behavioral change conclusive . Although , anecdotal evidence show result change , example , intervention focus condom use result increase condom commercial sexual encounter , rigorous evidence actually show significant reduction HIV prevalence Southern Africa country . Perhaps reason resides difference sexual behavior Africa ( e.g . much common concurrent partnership overlap significant time ) information campaign focus right message thus affect behavior matter . Or maybe , recent literature suggest people tend delay activity little bit unpleasant present ( like protect ) even large return future . People may aware long-term benefit safe sexual behavior . Alternatively , give lot weight short-term gain , either discount future heavily preference might inconsistent time , strong preference present . What replicable feasible intervention affect trade-off short long run return ? Can introduction small `` short term '' reward promote safer sexual behavior ? This intervention aim contrast difference reward next 4 month ( lottery ticket ) reward 10 year later ( HIV negative ) . The main issue interval sexual activity lottery . To gauge extent participation lottery , correct interval time among lottery draw , impact behavioural change , investigator plan short qualitative study couple month begin project . The research objective test rigorously evaluate whether introduction small financial reward short term promote safer sexual behaviour general , reduce HIV incidence particular , high risk environment . The result evaluation expect important input design effective HIV prevention Lesotho . Furthermore , credible impact evaluation also global public good sense offer reliable guidance international organization , government , donor , nongovernmental organization ongoing search effective HIV prevention program . 4 . Methods Evaluation Design 4.1 Evaluation Design The investigator propose conduct randomize control field trial rigorously test whether short-term financial incentive impact sexual behavior incidence HIV small set curable STIs youth live village serve outreach session New Start VCT Lesotho . The underlie question study individual get involve short-term risky sexual behavior potential long-term cost become HIV infected high , clearly case Lesotho . It appear like individual , extent coerce sex ( unfortunately also common problem ) ; put lot weight short-term gain expense long run benefit . If case , short run financial incentive may affect individual 's trade-off short long run return . In fact , exist preliminary evidence small ( financial ) incentive associate activity high return future result significant change behavior . However , little ( ) evidence incentive scheme work come sexual behavior . Thus , main hypothesis test system rapid feedback positive reinforcement use cash incentive effectively low risky sexual activity reduce rate HIV transmission . The primary outcome evaluate impact sub-set sexually-transmitted infection ( STIs ) , Syphilis Trichomoniasis , prevalent population incontrovertibly link risky sexual activity . Each STIs curable . This critical point , since enrollee test positive STI continue participate study treat cured infection . Thus , learn encourage positive reinforcement , mistake correct overcome . The investigator propose test hypothesis introduction financial incentive form lottery remain/become STI-negative , researcher believe replicable relatively easy scale-up . Lotteries also value risk-takers individual might also one risky sexual behavior , thus provide additional incentive would reach important group . The presumption financial incentive influence individual ' trade-off short long run return respect sexual behavior . The sample population consist youth age 18-30 live village serve outreach activity rural peri-urban village implement VCT center Lesotho The investigator aim study population 5,000 ( see section 4.3 detail ) . To extent demand exceed supply ; researcher randomly choose participant . In randomized controlled field trial sample population randomly divide treatment group ( individual chance participate lottery ) comparison ( individual take part lottery ) group . Here , randomization individual level . 30 % individual assign first treatment group , 30 % second treatment group , 40 % control group . The two treatment group differ amount winning possible lottery . The control group slightly large control possibility attrition . Since treatment randomly assign , provide sample contains sufficiently large number individual , unit assign treatment comparison group similar expectation intervention . The causal effect intervention therefore gauge compare mean outcome treatment comparison group intervention . The random assignment control treatment group do transparent way , example draw bag individual treatment control group Not randomization guarantee internal validity , also typically fair way allocate participant across treatment comparison group . Individuals treat control group receive free sexual health discussion session part PSI prevention treatment program , free HIV STI test , free STI treatment ( individual test positive ) , free counseling STI/HIV test . PSI also provide free male female condom . Individuals treatment group eligible participate lottery test STI negative . There test lottery draw every four month . Participants know advance amount lottery reward . The lottery drawn among STI negative people village . There 4 winner ( i.e . two men two woman ) village . The exact detail type size reward precisely decide pilot project . The focus STI status condition participation lottery , rather HIV status , primarily base ethical consideration . By focus STIs curable , investigator also study intervention affect behavior HIV-positive HIV-negative participant . STI-positive individual , receive treatment cure , eligible participate future lottery draw . The proposal call seven follow-up survey , one 4-month period . The investigator aim survey twice sample around 5,000 participant . To generate precise estimate impact intervention , baseline survey also implement . The information baseline survey also assist stratify sample use study heterogeneous effect . In order minimize attrition project , researcher collect data name , address phone number participant way preserve confidentiality decrease willingness participate ( see section 5 detail ) . The design experiment avoids usual complication selection report bias randomize individual incentive learn STIs status . However , self-selection people choose decide participate study , , example , motivate aware perhaps knowledgeable option ( case HIV positive ) compare someone test . Study participant also choose whether know HIV status . However , counsel provided assist make inform decision accept result . Those mainly problem external validity . The investigator aware problem practice , difficult avoid , since investigator impose study representative sample population .</detailed_description>
