	<detailed_description>The impact neurological disorder enormous term mortality , morbidity , physical disability psychological distress , increase low-resource setting lack diagnosis treatment facility well delay management . The frequency neurological disorder pattern causative condition little document low-resource primary care settings.In sub-Saharan Africa , observational study conduct past 20 year , show neurological disorder account 7 24 % admission . Central nervous system ( CNS ) infection suspect one third patient admit neurological symptom , specific microbial aetiology identify half . Where investigate , one third neurological admission relate HIV infection setting . Neuro-infections also lead aetiology common neurological symptom ( headache ) African HIV-positive patient , autopsy study demonstrate CNS infection account 20 % cause death HIV-positive individual sub-Saharan Africa . Most CNS infection may consider `` severe treatable disease '' , e.g . human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) , cerebral malaria , bacterial meningitis , CNS tuberculosis , neurosyphilis , cryptococcal meningitis toxoplasma encephalitis etc . If leave untreated , death serious sequel usually occur ; mortality rate neurological admission high 30 % mentioned study . However , outcome may favourable timely appropriate management . In resource-constrained setting elsewhere , `` severe treatable '' condition target priority clinical decision-making process . Unfortunately , neuro-infections present non-specific symptom early stage , lead important diagnostic delay . Moreover , neurological diagnosis frequently require advanced technology , far beyond reach tropical rural setting , rely clinical judgment first-line laboratory result . However , confirm exclude power clinical laboratory feature limit never adequately quantified , particular setting lack reference diagnostic method . Several rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) develop last decade condition like malaria HIV infection , diagnostic contribution never evaluate within multi-disease approach . Most CNS infection worldwide distribution affect disproportionally ( sub ) -tropical region , others restrict tropic . Also , many infection potential neuropathogenicity belong group 17 Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) attention recently bring . As say , may consider `` severe treatable '' ; however , tropical setting , epidemiology NTDs infectious disease ( IDs ) largely unknown , seriously impair case find clinical decision-making . The aim research therefore improve early diagnosis severe treatable neglect non-neglected infectious disease may present neurological symptom province Bandundu , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) . This achieved elaboration validation new diagnostic guideline base epidemiological evidence , combine classic clinical predictor panel simple point-of-care rapid diagnostic test , design `` panoramic '' ( not-to-miss ) approach . In particular , investigator hope determine pre-test probability HAT priority neglect tropical diseases/infectious disease patient present neurological disorder ; assess predictive weight clinical first-line laboratory feature diagnosis HAT priority NTDs/IDs ; assess sensitivity , specificity predictive value novel point-of-care RDTs diagnosis HAT priority NTDs/IDs patient neurological disorder ; ass diagnostic performance combination novel exist RDTs diagnose HAT priority NTDs/IDs patient neurological disorder . Enrolled patient manage accord current standard care Bandundu , DRC treatments locally available health facilities/programs . The objective methodology second step research ( evaluation exist algorithms elaboration/validation new guideline ) describe subsequent protocol . Another similar study ( describe another protocol ) conduct parallel explore aetiology prolong fever set .</detailed_description>
