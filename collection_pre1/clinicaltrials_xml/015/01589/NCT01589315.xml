	<brief_summary>This pilot , open label investigation evaluate safety efficacy new form electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Both efficacy adverse cognitive effect ECT highly contingent intracerebral current path current density ECT stimulus . However , impedance skull individual difference skull anatomy severely limit spatial target stimulation , create mark individual difference intracerebral current density . To address problem , investigator explore various mean overcome limitation . An approach modify electrical stimulus induce focal seizure . The common method ECT administration US use bidirectional , constant current , brief pulse , large ( approximately 3 sq . . surface area ) identically size shaped electrode . In contrast , protocol investigator couple unidirectional current flow electrode geometry involve small large electrode differ 3:1 surface area . Unidirectional current widely use ECT , 1940 's continue use European American device today . Transcranial electrical stimulation make focal stimulating anode-cathode arrangement , electrodes differ surface area . The investigator show nonhuman primate capacity produce focal frontal seizure induction condition unidirectional current flow small anterior anode ( place forehead nasion ) large posterior cathode anterior motor strip . Furthermore , investigator expect , , seizures result motor convulsion . Thirty outpatient refer ECT participate . Relative concurrent reference data ongoing ECT protocol , investigator hypothesize acute subacute adverse cognitive effect FEAST substantially less patient receive state-of-the art ECT , traditional bidirectional , nonfocal stimulus . The investigator also hypothesize majority patient remit FEAST . Thus , improve efficiency ECT stimulus switch unidirectional current use new electrode geometry , investigator expect able induce focal seizure . The investigator hypothesize pilot study provide evidence treatment superior traditional ECT low dosing requirement superior side effect profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study provide preliminary evaluation follow : 1 . Determination whether focal seizure induce FEAST methodology ( unidirectional stimulation , small anterior large posterior electrode ) . 1 . Focality assess occurrence non-motor seizure . 2 . Electroencephalographic evidence pronounce asymmetry frontal lead . 2 . Determination whether FEAST methodology result reduce seizure threshold . a. Seizure threshold quantify start treatment course use standard method limit titration procedure compare threshold determination match patient treated conventional ECT method . 3 . Characterization dynamic impedance use FEAST methodology . . Dynamic impedance passage electrical stimulus quantify administration compare value obtain match patient treated conventional ECT method . 4 . Characterization efficacy FEAST method safety treatment . 1 . The primary efficacy measure 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression . The change score immediately follow treatment course compare patient treat FEAST methodology match patient treated conventional ECT method . 2 . Acute , subacute , long-term cognitive side effect follow FEAST assess comprehensive neuropsychological battery . The primary acute measure include time return orientation follow seizure induction retrograde amnesia word shape . The primary subacute measure include assessment anterograde amnesia ( forgetting delay ) verbal list reproduction complex figure , well retrograde amnesia autobiographical information . The primary long-term measure retrograde amnesia autobiographical information , assess 6-months follow FEAST course . The neuropsychological measure compare patient treat FEAST methodology match patient treated conventional ECT method , well healthy participant receive administer neuropsychological battery interval FEAST patient , without Intervention . 3 . Safety also determine examine number frequency serious adverse advent adverse event , well score Columbia University ECT Side Effect Scale .</detailed_description>
