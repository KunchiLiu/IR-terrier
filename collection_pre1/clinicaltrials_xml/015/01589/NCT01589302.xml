	<brief_title>PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , B-cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial , type research study , involve treatment investigational ( experimental ) drug call PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) , `` kinase inhibitor '' . `` Kinases '' proteins inside cell help live grow . The specific kinase inhibit blocked study drug believe help blood cancer cell grow live . By inhibit `` block '' activity kinase , possible study drug may able kill cancer cell stop grow . This study involve treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( B-PLL ) respond relapsed standard treatment . This trial study effective PCI-32765 treating CLL , SLL , B-PLL effect , good and/or bad , treatment drug patient cancer .</detailed_description>
