	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis ( AS ) common valvular disorder , affect 2 % 4 % adult old 65 year . It gradually constantly progressive disease whit long asymptomatic phase , symptom develop , prognosis poor . Currently , treatment strategy focus mainly watchful monitor judicious time aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) . However , patient proper candidate corrective surgery need development medical treatment increase . Various mechanism suggest progression AS recent observational study suggest mechanical stress `` wear tear '' also active inflammatory process likewise atherosclerosis may contribute progression AS . Through clinical descriptive study , atherosclerotic risk factor , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , obesity , smoking , metabolic syndrome know facilitate progression AS . The renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) activate early stage AS , promote developemtnt leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , myocardial fibrosis , diastolic dysfunction . Lipid lower therapy RAS blockade emerge potential medical treatment slow progression AS , however , many clinical trial show consistent beneficial effect statins.8-10 RAS blocker perceive relative contraindication due concern increase pressure gradient . However , patient AS tolerate RAS blocker well initiation use angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor appear confer long term survival benefit patient consider contraindication include AS.Pressure overload LV , activation RAS , subsequent adverse LV remodeling , myocardial fibrosis , LV dysfunction may potential therapeutic target retard progression AS improve exercise capacity , even long-term outcome . RAS blocker include ACEI angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) know improve exercise capacity long term outcome patient hypertension , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction . We hypothesize fimasartan , new generation ARBs , would improve exercise capacity decrease rate progression AS modify hemodynamic factor reduce adverse LV remodeling favorably patient asymptomatic moderate severe AS . Prospective , double-blinded , randomized clinical trial enrollment normotensive hypertensive patient age 20 75 require echocardiography clinical indication , typically consist know aortic stenosis presence cardiac murmur . Moderate severe aortic stenosis define continuous wave Doppler determine peak aortic valve jet velocity 3.0 - 4.5 m/s mean pressure gradient 25 - 49 mmHg , aortic valve area 0.76 - 1.5 cm2 . Patients meet inclusion criterion without exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 angiotensin receptor blocker , Fimasartan , placebo . After 1-year enrollment period , patient follow 1 year . Cardiopulmonary exercise test perform baseline enrollment period , end follow-up . Echocardiographic evaluation perform regular interval baseline 6 month interval end study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female Age : 2075 year Moderate severe aortic stenosis define continuous wave Doppler determine peak aortic valve jet velocity 3.0 4.5 m/s , mean pressure gradient 25 49 mmHg , aortic valve area 0.76 1.5 cm2 . Asymptomatic aortic stenosis patient , Stationary minimum dyspnea exertion ( NYHA Fc ≤ I II ) include . Patients prescribed ACEI ARBs treatment hypertension enrol 2 week washout period . SBP 120140 mmHg without medication regardless presence hypertension . Patients BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg without medication include BP control antihypertensive medication ACEI/ARBs . Patients able perform appropriate cardiopulmonary exercise test treadmill . The patient agree study protocol schedule clinical , cardiopulmonary exercise test , echocardiographic followup , provide informed , write consent , approve appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee respective clinical site . Symptomatic aortic stenosis : presence exertional dyspnea ( ≥ NYHA Fc III ) , angina syncope Very severe aortic stenosis regardless presence symptom . It define critical stenosis aortic valve area ≤ 0.75 cm2 accompany peak aortic jet velocity ≥4.5 m/s mean transaortic pressure gradient ≥50 mm Hg Doppler echocardiography . Uncontrolled HTN ( SBP &gt; 160 DBP &gt; 100 ) without ACEI ARBs 2weeks wash period patient prescribed ACEI ARBs treatment hypertension . Patients known history coronary artery disease include myocardial infarction , regardless treatment ( medication , percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass graft ) . Planned cardiac surgery plan major noncardiac surgery within study period . Stroke resuscitate sudden death past 6 month . Chronic disease require treatment oral , intravenous , intraarticular corticosteroid ( use topical , nasal corticosteroid permissible ) . Untreated hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism TSH level 2 time upper limit normal . A diagnosis cancer ( superficial squamous basal cell skin cancer ) past 3 year current treatment active cancer . Female childbearing potential use adequate contraception woman pregnant breastfeeding . Any clinically significant abnormality identify screen visit , physical examination , laboratory test , electrocardiogram , judgment Investigator , would preclude safe completion study . Evidence congestive heart failure , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % . Significant renal disease manifest serum creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dL Hepatic disease biliary tract obstruction , significant hepatic enzyme elevation ( ALT AST &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) . Documented bilateral renal artery stenosis know contraindication ACEI ARBs History chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma manifest acute aggravation COPD past 6 month , currently take bronchodilator include longacting beta2 agonist , anticholinergic , inhaled steroid . Other valvular disease : Moderate severe mitral regurgitation mitral stenosis , Moderate severe aortic regurgitation Patients unable perform cardiopulmonary exercise test . Unwillingness inability comply procedure describe protocol . Patient diagnose galactose intolerance , lactase deficiency , malabsorption glucose galactose main ingredient placebo .</criteria>
