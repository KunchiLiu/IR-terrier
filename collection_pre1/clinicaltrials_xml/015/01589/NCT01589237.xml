	<brief_title>Extension Randomized , Double-blind , Placebo Controlled Study LCQ908 Subjects With Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 52 week open label extension start low treatment dose use CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 ( i.e. , 10 mg ) optional up-titrations , evaluate overall long-term safety tolerability LCQ908 patient Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome , either discontinue CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study ( due tolerability issue ) complete CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study 52 week . In addition , patient previously complete study CLCQ908A2212/NCT01146522 eligible participate . Following Protocol amendment 2 , original 52 week duration study ( CLCQ908B2305 ) become Part A LCQ908B2305 78 week extension become Part B . However , follow Protocol amendment 3 , Part B end time last patient Part A complete 52 week . The reason termination Part B finding December 2014 interim analysis suggest size benefit anticipate continued participation patient 18 month extension trial ( Part B ) longer support trial extension beyond Part A .</detailed_description>
