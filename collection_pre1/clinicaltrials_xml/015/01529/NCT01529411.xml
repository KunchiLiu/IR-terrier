	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Vinflunine Maintenance Therapy Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vinflunine drug recently approve Europe treatment advance metastatic urothelial cancer platinum-failure . It prove improve survival result compare best suportive care . In adition , tolerability favourable , specially lead appearance neuropathy cumulative toxic effect . In study , propose test feasibility , term tolerability efficacy monotherapy vinflunine patient , complete first-line cisplatin-based treatment Transitional Cell Carcinoma Urothelial Tract ( CCTU ) , reach stabilization objective response . In order adequate control group propose design phase II trial one group receive standard management ( follow-up progression disease ) .</detailed_description>
