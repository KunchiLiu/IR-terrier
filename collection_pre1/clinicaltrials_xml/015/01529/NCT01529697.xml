	<brief_summary>Inhaled medication mainstay therapeutic management respiratory disorder . Considered many 'simple ' 'easy ' use , clinician aware inhaler often improperly use . However , tool detect record errors either time method dose administration The investigator design device make acoustic record time inhaler use . Opening device make acoustic file record , file `` time-stamped '' mean time drug administration record . When device retrieve acoustic analysis perform , step involve use inhaler determine . Hence , subject inhaler technique assess error inhaler use identify . Together mean error inhaler technique timing use quantify . In study investigator attach device discus dry powder inhaler . In order eliminate behavioral component adherence identify mechanical issue associate effective inhaler use investigator study subject already Hospital already prescribe discus inhaler . The investigator hypothesize device would identify error technique common would provide insight error might eliminate .</brief_summary>
