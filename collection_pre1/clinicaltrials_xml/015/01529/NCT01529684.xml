	<brief_title>A Study Look How Single Oral Dose 14C-OSI-906 Absorbed , Broken Down Eliminated Body</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include two part : Part A Subjects admitted clinical research unit Day -1 remain confined unit post dose discharge criterion meet maximum 10 day . On Day 1 , subject receive single oral dose 14C-labeled OSI-906 . Part B ( optional ) Once subject complete part A , subject may elect continue participation Part B . Subjects receive OSI-906 ( non-radiolabeled ) twice daily mouth . Subjects see schedule visit every 7 day first 36 day every 21 day .</detailed_description>
