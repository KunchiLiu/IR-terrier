	<brief_title>Effect Post Discharge Follow-up Readmission Rates Congestive Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure , disease affect large proportion age population , continue associate poor outcome especially patient require hospitalization . Each year , nearly 1 million Americans newly diagnose congestive heart failure currently , least 5 million Americans live chronic disease . The number patient heart failure expect reach 10 million year 2037.This population consumes large proportion health care resource main cost hospitalization . The heart failure 30-day readmission rate hover around 25 % nationally , approximate cost $ 7,000 per hospitalization . In effort improve care reduce cost , heart failure disease management program become prevalent . Recent data suggest multi-disciplinary disease management program may reduce mortality hospitalization well improve cost , patient ' ability self-care , quality life . It provide mean increase use evidence-based therapy , improve patient education , decrease resource usage . Heart failure management program involve early assessment , optimize treatment , easy access care , education psychosocial support . Patients hospitalize decompensated congestive heart failure among high risk group morbidity mortality among people chronic heart failure large proportion risk occur early discharge . Thus , goal program include manage gap inpatient outpatient setting ideally involve multidisciplinary team order serve patient comprehensive manner . We propose determine relative efficacy post-discharge disease management system . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study determine time first hospital readmission lengthen use disease management model . STUDY DESIGN : This prospective , one year pilot study enroll patient admit Saint Francis Hospital Medical Center ( SFHMC ) admit diagnosis acute decompensated heart failure refer Congestive Heart Failure Disease ( CHF ) Management Program attend physician . The patient enrol study follow maximum 90 day post-discharge . A case control group 60-100 subject also establish primary endpoint analysis . METHODS : Patients meet study criterion , inform consent obtain hospital discharge first Disease Management visit . Patients follow 90 day post-discharge . Clinic visit , homecare agency visit , heart failure education class attendance , date hospital readmission track . Descriptive characteristic patient record time enrollment . Descriptive characteristic include demographic , etiology heart failure , symptom , physical assessment , current medication , lab result , diagnostic test result . In everyday practice , Congestive Heart Failure Disease Management Program administers clinical questionnaire patient assess quality life heart failure management knowledge . The clinical questionnaire constitute standard care patient include : - Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test : give patient first Disease Management visit attend Congestive Heart Failure educational series determine level understanding self-management heart failure . - Kansas City Living Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) : This validated quality life survey . The questionnaire 23-item , self-administered instrument quantifies physical function , symptom ( frequency , severity recent change ) , social function , self-efficacy knowledge , quality . This survey administer patient upon enrollment Disease Management Program prior discharge Disease Management Program . Results questionnaires collected enrollment discharge score compare improvement level understand self-management heart failure overall quality life . One hundred consecutive patient discharge SFHMC primary diagnosis acute decompensated heart failure refer Congestive heart Failure Disease Management Program undergo retrospective chart review establish case control group . The study team perform retrospective chart review abstract follow data : hospital admission date , hospital discharge date , attend physician , age , ejection fraction . RISKS AND SAFETY : There physical psychological risk associate study . The study involve experimental treatment invasive therapy . There less minimal risk disclosure clinical information maintain file link patient 's medical record data . This file keep allow follow track heart failure re-admission . The file password protect available solely site Principal Investigator Institutional Review Board-approved study staff . At end study , follow data analysis publication abstract paper appropriate peer review journal ( ) , file link patient name case report form destroy . POTENTIAL BENEFITS : There potential benefit patient whose record enter database . The potential benefit society future patient diagnosed heart failure . Implementation disease management model may improve functional clinical outcome productive interaction patient provider . A disease management model may decrease hospital re-admission rate associate cost . If disease management model prove effective , result provide framework expand care opportunity establish new model heart failure patient health care system well system . DATA ANALYSIS : The primary endpoint assess continuous variable use Kaplan Meier survival analysis . The time all-cause readmission readmission heart failure assess use methodology . The time all-cause readmission readmission heart failure CHF Disease Management Group compare aggregate hospital readmission data . The QOL questionnaire analyze use t-test comparing enrollment 2 month KCCQ score . The validity individual domain questionnaire independently establish component summary score consider valid representation intend domain .</detailed_description>
