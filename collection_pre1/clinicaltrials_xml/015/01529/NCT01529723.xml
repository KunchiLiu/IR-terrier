	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To show dysphagia screen tool achieves great 90 % positive negative predictive value relative gold standard dysphagia define study Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation Swallowing ( FEES ) perform speech-language pathologist . 2 . To show risk aspiration pneumonia le 10 % hospitalization patient undergo dysphagia screen tool . 3 . To show dysphagia screen tool applicable across spectrum stroke severity , define NIH stroke scale score . 4 . To assess specific component combination component dysphagia screen tool respect positive negative predictive value . 5 . To show dysphagia screen tool excellent inter-rater reliability perform 5 minute . Methods : The investigator recruit 18 patient clinical diagnosis acute ischemic stroke . Patients clinical diagnosis stroke initially screen dysphagia screen tool within 24 hour last know well admission two separate evaluator perform 2 hour apart . The first evaluator either nurse ( e.g . emergency medicine nurse ) physician ( e.g . neurology resident ) certify use screen . The second evaluator nurse research coordinator study . The first screen part routine clinical care use determine patient 's eating status ( NPO full diet ) . Timing evaluation record . Patients include NIHSS 8-16 inclusive . Patients primary intracerebral hemorrhage unable read consent form due language barrier ( aphasia ) exclude study . Consent aphasic patient obtain authorized representative . Lesion side ( right , leave ) , lesion location ( hemispheric , brainstem , cerebellar ) , TOAST classification ( validated method stroke mechanism classification ) record . The result patient initially enrol study later exclude brain imaging finding record . Patients studied FEES within 6 hour first bedside screen ASHA certify speech-language pathologist include . Time screen FEES examination record . A patient study 6 hour first bedside screen exclude . Patients pass initial screen later fail FEES examination make NPO potential implication clinical outcome . Patients fail initial screen later pas FEES examination wil release NPO status . Results brain imaging also record . Patients negative brain imaging also include diagnostic imaging CT may sensitive first 24 hour MRI may available within hour arrival . Patients include study also follow hospitalization clinical evidence aspiration pneumonia 7 day . A 90-day phone call make determine patient 's level function accord modify Rankin scale , standard outcome tool stroke . Patients whose final diagnosis stroke exclude analysis . Statistical analysis : Inter-rater reliability bedside screener calculate . Results screen perform last bedside screener compare finding FEES . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value score calculate use 2 2 table analysis . Likelihood ratio calculate . Aspiration pneumonia rate describe descriptive statistic .</detailed_description>
