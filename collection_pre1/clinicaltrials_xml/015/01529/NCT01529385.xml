	<brief_title>Mild Compression Sock Control Lower Extremity Edema Individuals With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) commonly associate diabetes . Clinicians often reluctant apply compressive stocking patient diabetes swollen leg due fear exacerbate symptom PAD . The study sock newly formulate sock offer mild compression ( 18-25mmHg ) . The sock make especially diabetic patient suffers concomitant low extremity edema . Eighty patient diabetes low extremity edema recruit . Upon ensure enrollment criterion meet , baseline edema ( measure circumference foot , ankle calf ) , ankle brachial index ( ABI ) , skin perfusion pressure , cutaneous fluid level ( measure MoistureMeter ) assess . Subjects provide four pair sock . Subjects randomize 1:1 distribution receive either mild compression diabetic sock standard diabetic sock . They return four weekly follow visit . Additionally sub-set 30 subject monitor change physical activity pre post sock usage . Physical activity monitor use assess daily physical activity 48hrs prior receive sock wear sock four week additional 48hrs monitor .</detailed_description>

Patient diabetes type 1 type 2 confirm patient 's primary care physician . Patients active wound infection , untreated osteomyelitis , gangrene Patients dementia , impaired cognitive function would prohibit study compliance Patients wide spread malignancy systemically immunocompromising disease Patients unable unwilling participate procedure follow evaluation Patient deep and/or large ulcer require copious bandaging may affect efficacy sock . Patients superficial ulcer require light dress exclude . The ulcer , present , must superficial exhibit clinical sign infection Patients restless leg syndrome , Parkinson 's disease , disease cause involuntary movement microvascular assessment Patients severe edema calf circumference great 24 '' 46cm Patients severe lymphedema Patients edema opinion investigator require high compression 1825mmHg provide compression sock Patients currently wear compression hose . ( Patients prescribe compression hose worn compression stocking past 6 month include study ) Patients unable walk one hundred foot .</criteria>
