	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination temsirolimus metformin give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Temsirolimus design block protein call mTOR ( protein think cause cancer cell grow ) inside cancer cell . This may interfere growth spread cancer cell possibly kill . Metformin design treat patient diabetes . It may able block protein mTOR slow growth tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Combination With Metformin Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level temsirolimus metformin base join study . Up 6 dose level temsirolimus metformin test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination temsirolimus metformin find . Expansion Groups : When high tolerable dose study drug combination find , one group 40 endometrial carcinoma patient enrol tumor-specific expansion group . Study Drug Administration : The first study cycle 42 day cycle 28 day . Before start take drug Cycle 1 , take metformin first 2 week . This call titration period . On Days 15 , 22 , 29 36 Cycle 1 , receive temsirolimus vein 30-60 minute . For cycle , receive temsirolimus vein 30-60 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Before receive temsirolimus , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) vein 30-60 minute help low risk allergic reaction . You take metformin mouth every day time day meal cup water ( 8 ounce ) . You take home except day study visit . On study visit day , may take metformin receive temsirolimus . Depending dose , may take metformin 1-3 time daily . Your study doctor tell take drug . You give letter take home doctor ( ) study drug administration part care provide outside MD Anderson . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask health , drug take , side effect . Exams test perform receive study drug day . Cycle 1 Day 1 test exams may repeat do within 7 day . If part expansion group , within 7 day Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . - If part expansion group certain mutation , biopsy PD testing . The tumor biopsy collect use either fine needle aspiration core biopsy , depend location size tumor . To perform core biopsy , sample tissue remove use hollow core needle cut edge . To collect fine needle aspirate , small amount tissue withdrawn needle . If question mutation status , doctor discus . On Day 1 Cycle 1 ( titration period ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Week 1 , urine collect routine test . On Day 8 Cycle 1 ( titration period ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Day 29 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Week 1 , urine collect routine test . On Day 22 Day 36 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If part expansion group , Day 37 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test . - If part expansion group certain mutation , biopsy PD testing . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . On Day 15 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think need , perform often . After 6 month ( 6 cycle ) take study drug , CT scan MRI scan every 2-4 cycle study doctor think need . Length Study Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , return clinic . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . If part expansion group , - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test disease get bad . - If part expansion group certain mutation , biopsy PD test disease get bad . This investigational study . Temsirolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment renal cell carcinoma . Metformin FDA approve commercially available treatment diabetes mellitus . The combination drug treat advance cancer investigational . Up 104 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
