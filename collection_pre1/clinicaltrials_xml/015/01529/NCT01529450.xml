	<brief_summary>This prospective single-center , open label , pilot study investigate safety efficacy LDE225 patient locally advance metastatic basal cell carcinoma . Primary Objectives : • To explore effect oral LDE225 Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) individual locally advance metastatic BCC previously treat non-LDE225 Smo inhibitor . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate effect oral LDE225 tumor tissue biomarkers BCC activation ( Gii 1 , 2 , Patched 1,2 Ki67 ) individual non-na '' ive Smo inhibitor LDE225 , baseline end-of-treatment - To describe adverse effect oral LDE225 individual history non-LDE225 Smo inhibitor usage - To assess overall survival rate individual locally advance BCC metastatic BCC previously take non-LDE225 Smo inhibitor treatment LDE225</brief_summary>
