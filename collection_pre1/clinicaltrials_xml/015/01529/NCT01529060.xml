	<brief_summary>The investigator learn past research drug phenylbutyrate decrease amount branch chain amino acid byproduct bloodstreams healthy volunteer patient also patient certain disorder protein breakdown include maple syrup urine disease . Through study , investigator try find well phenylbutyrate ( NaPBA ) , also know name brand `` Buphenyl-TM '' , decrease BCAA branch chain keto chain acid blood patient MSUD . The investigator hope research investigator well able treat patient . Subjects MSUD take phenylbutyrate ( NaPBA ) powder form two-week treatment period powder placebo , substance effect body , two-week treatment period . They give amount powder undergo laboratory test two-week treatment period . The result compare study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylbutyrate Therapy Maple Syrup Urine Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maple syrup urine disease severe inborn error amino acid metabolism cause deficiency mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex ( BCKDC ) result accumulation branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) ( isoleucine , leucine , valine ) correspond branched-chain alpha-ketoacids ( BCKA ) [ alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate ( KMV ) , alpha-ketoisocaproate ( KIC ) , alpha-ketoisovalerate ( KIV ) ] tissue plasma . The disorder typically manifest potentially lethal episode intoxication present acute neurological deterioration , feed problem , weight loss , maple syrup odor urine . Current treatment base dietary manipulation protein restriction synthetic formula reduce BCAA content . However , mental social impairment still present majority patient spite dietary management . Our study seek investigate potential small molecule inhibition kinase regulate BCKDC apply novel activity sodium phenylbutyrate ( NaPBA ) , MSUD . Sodium phenylbutyrate use treat patient urea cycle disorder ( UCDs ) . In extensive study UCDs , note patient therapy NaPBA decrease plasma level BCAA . This lead u hypothesize NaPBA effect BCAA metabolism . This single-site , randomize , active-controlled , double-blind , cross-over study design enroll subject MSUD . Subjects randomly assign receive either sodium phenylbutyrate ( PB ) placebo 2 week , cross receive treatment 2 week . If study finding show sodium phenylbutyrate lower BCAA BCKA level patient , may prove effective adjunct treatment patient . A treatment option could prevent decrease accumulation BCAA BCKA state catabolism induce fasting intercurrent illness , thereby minimize prevent neurologic sequelae loss human potential result , would greatly benefit society .</detailed_description>
