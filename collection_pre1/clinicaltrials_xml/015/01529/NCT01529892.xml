	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine abuse addiction widespread cause increase pressure social , public health criminal justice system worldwide . Some risk develop addiction may genetic . Identifying specific genotype understanding interaction environment may help predict risk develop disease . In study investigator evaluate contribution difference one genotype - call CYP2D6 removal methamphetamine body . Methamphetamine remove body special enzymes liver . One enzymes call Cytochrome P450 2D6 . The activity 2D6 genetically determine . Some people active 2D6 whereas others 2D6 active . One group scientist find people low 2D6 activity less likely become methamphetamine addict . In study investigator determine activity 2D6 look CYP2D6 genotype . If low level 2D6 decrease risk methamphetamine addiction may less chemical ( call metabolite ) make 2D6 . The first step metabolism ( process removal drug body ) methamphetamine 2D6 conversion methamphetamine amphetamine para-hydroxymethamphetamine . 2D6 convert inactive chemical . In addition determine genotype , investigator interest relationship genotype methamphetamine metabolism . Thus , part study , give modest oral dose 5 milligram methamphetamine . After receive methamphetamine need collect urine 24 hour . The purpose study investigate impact genetic variation CYP2D6 disposition methamphetamine human body well pharmacologic effect human .</brief_summary>

The subject receive investigational drug participate research trial within 30 day , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose current study medication . 5 . Use prescription nonprescription drug , vitamin , herbal dietary supplement within seven day ( 14 day drug potential CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study mediation , unless , opinion Investigator sponsor , medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . 6 . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Examples condition could interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility include gastrointestinal bypass surgery , partial total gastrectomy , small bowel resection , vagotomy , malabsorption , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , intestinal urinary obstruction , celiac sprue . 7 . History hypersensitivity amphetaminetype drug , history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . 8 . Pregnancy fertile woman without adequate mean contraception . 9 . Any medical psychosocial condition would preclude useful , safe consistent participation .</criteria>
