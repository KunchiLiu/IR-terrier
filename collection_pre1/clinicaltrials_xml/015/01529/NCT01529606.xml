For patient standard treatment group , receive composite resin restoration decay teeth standard preventive treatment ( clean fluoride varnish application ) baseline . For patient plasma treatment group , receive plasma treatment cavity preparation , composite resin restoration , standard preventive treatment follow plasma treatment non-carious teeth . Standard preventive treatment plasma treatment repeat semi-annual ( 6-month ) recall visit . All composite restoration place accord manufacturer 's instruction .
