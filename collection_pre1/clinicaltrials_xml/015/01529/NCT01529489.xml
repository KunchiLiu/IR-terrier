	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) present slow pulmonary oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) heart rate ( HR ) kinetics compare age-matched control . Patients COPD present significant loss body mass , decreased strength endurance respiratory muscle low limb , lead reduce exercise capacity . This reduced exercise capacity mark slow kinetics VO2 HR onset heavy-intensity exercise . Additionally , derangement diffusive convective transport oxygen skeletal muscle mitocondria , intramyocyte metabolic machinery , high ventilation disturbance mechanic breathe , hypoxemia , pulmonary hemodynamics , autonomic balance , peripheral vasodilation , accumulation by-product might relate increased muscle fatigability could slow response systemic ( central ) peripheral ( microvascular ) oxygen delivery point kinetics VO2 might become limited O2 availability HR . Thus , physical training program low limb , addition present scientific evidence `` A '' , important component , result reversal manifestation COPD , result improvement exercise capacity , well significantly speed VO2 HR kinetics patient COPD . However , take account choice appropriate program limitation severity disease . Assuming COPD patient present slow VO2 HR kinetics , investigator hypothesize heavy-intense interval physical training equipament elliptical would promote great increase functionality ( functional performance ) speed kinetics cycle ergometer elliptical equipment constant-load intense exercise test COPD patient . In context , present study intend evaluate compare effect resistive plus aerobic physical training interval physical training oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) heart rate ( HR ) kinetics response onset cycle ergometer elliptical equipment constant-load intense exercise test patient COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Two Physical Training Programs Oxygen Uptake Heart Rate On-kinetics Patients COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects perform two physical train program follow test : lung function test , cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPT ) , constant-load exercise test cycle ergometer , Constant-load exercise test elliptical equipament , one repetition maximum test ( 1RM ) , alternate day . - Lung function : All patient underwent spirometry determination FEV1 FVC accord American Thoracic Society recommendation . Spirometry perform use COSMED microQuark PC - base Spirometer ® , ( Pavona di Albano - Roma , Itália ) , calibrated test . - Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( CPT ) : Incremental symptom-limited exercise test perform cycle-ergometer ( Ergo FIT® , model Ergo 167 Cycle , Pirmasens , Germany ) use computer-based ventilatory expire gas analysis system ( VO2000 , Medgraphics Corp. , St. Paul , MN ) . All subject underwent CPT determine peak work rate peak oxygen uptake ( peak VO2 ) . The subject ' electrocardiographic recording monitor use cardiac monitor , SpO2 , BP sensation dyspnea fatigue use BE-CR-10 . A gas analyzer ( VO2000 Medgraphics® , St Paul MN , USA ) use obtain participant ' VO2 stage test . The ergospirometric value record mean value measure every three breath use Aerograph® program . The VO2 determine choose high coherent value final 30 second stage . - Constant-load exercise test cycle ergometer Constant-load exercise test elliptical equipament : The two exercise test perform 70 % previously determine work rate CPT . During CSET , VO2 measure breath-by-breath average every three respiration , SpO2 , HR , electrocardiogram continuously monitor , calculate on-Kinetics VO2 HR . * Physical training program : - The interval physical training elliptical trainer ( Kiko's® HM 6022 , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) totalize 18 session individual group attend least twice week . Each session last 60 minute individual meeting . The minimal work rate equipment 40W low increment work rate 10W . The elliptical trainer allow combined exercise upper limb , however , present study , exercise perform arm fix , every participant 's HR monitor use pulse frequency meter ( Polar® FS2cTM Kempele , Finland ) , pulse oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) use pulse oximeter ( Nonin® , model 8500A , Minneapolis , Mn , USA ) , blood pressure ( BP ) use mercury sphygmomanometer ( Oxigel® , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) sensation dyspnea lower limb fatigue use Modified Borg CR-10 Scale ( BE-CR10 ) . The elliptical exercise interval training base study perform interval training exercise cycle ergometer . This 30-minute exercise rest interval establish one minute . The exercise 's work rateworkload maximal achieve CPT , modify session finish The individual reach 40W CPT perform 30 second exercise period 40W 1-minute rest interval . The volunteer achieve workload equal high 40W perform 1-minute exercising period workload achieve CPT 1-minute resting interval . During exercise equipment , individual keep speed 40 50 rpm.Vital sign ( HR , BP , SpO2 ) record begin end session , well monitor , elliptical exercise . During training , vital sign record first 30 second rest interval . - The aerobic associate resist physical training consist thirty minute oa aerobic train 60-70 % work rate obtain CPT subsequently three set fifteen repetition resistance train low limb leg press intensity 40-60 % one repetition maximum test .</detailed_description>
