	<brief_summary>The objective study compare time onset Dysport® versus Botox® treatment lateral orbital rhytids ( `` crow 's foot '' ) . Thirty subject enrol study ; specifically 30 male female patient 18 year old moderate severe lateral orbital rhytids maximum contracture . Each patient randomize treat Dysport® one side Botox® side . Both injector patient blind injected toxin . The efficacy endpoint determine investigator subject live assessment `` crow 's foot '' rest maximum contraction visit ( every day 6 day post-injection , every month 9 month follow ) use validate 5 point photographic scale ( wrinkle [ 0 ] , fine wrinkle [ 1 ] , fine wrinkle [ 2 ] , moderate wrinkle [ 3 ] severe wrinkle [ 4 ] ) use previous study .

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Dysport® ( Medicis , Scottsdale , AZ ) formulation ( previously know 52120 Reloxin® ) Clostridium botulinum type A ( BoNT-A ) toxin-hemagglutinin complex use United States ( US ) cosmetic clinical program . It identical Ipsen product market outside United States clinical study United States cosmetic non-cosmetic use . Dysport® injection use relax musculature upper face , reduce appearance dynamic rhytids . Previously FDA-approved Botulinum type A toxin utilized upper face treat glabellar rhytids nearly two decade . Botox® Cosmetic ( Allergan , Irvine , CA ) , first FDA-approved Botulinum toxin type A approve United States treatment glabellar rhytids . Its efficacy safety proven multiple study . However , comparison onset action exist amongst different BoNT-A product . This study seek compare onset action two BoNT-A product , Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic . BACKGROUND : Relaxation facial musculature routinely accomplish cosmetic use use Clostridium botulinum type A. Clostridium botulinum type A toxin reduces recruitment specific muscle group . Many study publish peer-reviewed medical journal regard cosmetic use biologic.2-11 Clostridium botulinum form Botox® Cosmetic FDA-approved cosmetic use treatment rhytids glabellar region . Dysport® , brand name Ipsen product market outside United States clinical study United States cosmetic non-cosmetic use , current name use FDA-approval . Many study demonstrate effect botulinum toxin facial rhytids produce underlie coordinate muscle group . Those glabellar area , upper forehead , low forehead , periocular perinasal area particularly well-documented . Previous report Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic medication show effective relaxation glabellar rhytids injection.12-17 The common adverse event ( AE ) see follow use Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic treatment blepharospasm ptosis . Some patient report diplopia symptom result spread effect mid-facial muscle . Other AEs report injection site reaction , skin rash , influenza-like symptom , dry eye , tear , bruising , eyelid swelling . Reversible ophthalmoplegia report excessive dosing . Multiple Phase II III clinical study conduct North America determine optimal dose Dysport® cosmetic use glabellar area , 50 unit Dysport® generally recognize optimal dosage treatment glabellar region . Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic dose generally 2.5:1 3:1 unit unit conversion . For crows foot area , 10 unit Botox® Cosmetic 4 injection point use similar fashion , produce comparable result 25 unit Dysport® four injection point . What clear whether one BoNT-A provide quicker onset action . This study intend compare onset action BoNT-A daily live assessment patient week follow injection either Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic . INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS : Dysport® formulation ( previously know 52120 Reloxin® ) Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex use United States ( US ) cosmetic clinical program .
