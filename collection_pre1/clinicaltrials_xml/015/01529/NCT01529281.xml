	<brief_summary>It well document exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD ) decrease muscle function cause severe soreness discomfort . Branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) supplementation show increase protein synthesis decrease muscle protein breakdown , however , effect BCAAs recovery EIMD unknown . Thus , aim study examine effect BCAA supplement marker muscle damage .</brief_summary>
