	<brief_summary>The investigator design three-part quality improvement intervention 1 ) improve clinic-based measurement blood pressure , 2 ) introduce care management system promote self-management behavior rapidly titrate medication algorithms develop accord guideline 3 ) introduce interactive , needs-based , longitudinal-provider education system promote patient-centered care provide practical example patient-provider communication strategy . The intervention occur six clinic within metropolitan area Baltimore , Maryland . The investigator also describe clinic health system characteristic measure association implementation ( uptake ) , success ( improvement blood pressure control reductions racial disparity ) , sustainability three-part intervention 12 -24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Method Health System Quality Improvement Intervention Reduce Hypertension Disparities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension common US . From efficacy observational study , know achieve blood pressure control reduce morbidity mortality . However , less one-third person hypertension achieve control define national guideline . Furthermore , racial disparity hypertension clearly document African American patient less likely Caucasians achieve adequate control . The objective study study implementation multi-method quality improvement intervention pragmatic clinical trial . Six clinic site within Johns Hopkins Community Physicians ( JHCP ) healthcare system select participation study . The site locate within metropolitan ara Baltimore , Maryland , yet differ greatly . We define context local characteristic study site determine characteristic associate blood pressure control racial disparity clinic ( micro-system ) health system ( macro-system ) level . We deploy three-part quality improvement intervention 1 ) improve clinic-based measurement blood pressure , 2 ) introduce care management system promote patient ' self-management behavior rapidly titrate medication algorithms develop accord guideline 3 ) introduce interactive , needs-based , longitudinal-provider education system promote patient-centered care provide practical example patient-provider communication strategy . Using statistical process control charting , determine stability blood pressure control system prior intervention introduction intervention . We vary order intervention among six clinical site determine intervention independently effective local context effect repeatable contextual situation within macro-system . In addition , study organizational characteristic feature local context associate implementation , uptake intervention success intervention achieve blood pressure control reduce racial disparity blood pressure control clinic level .</detailed_description>
