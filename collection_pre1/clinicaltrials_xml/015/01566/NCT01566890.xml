	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) inherit blood disorder cause red blood cell change shape round shape half-moon/crescent sickled shape . Sickle-shaped cell cause problem get stuck blood vessel , block blood flow , cause inflammation injury important body part . There specific treatment improve condition promote blood flow hinder sickle cell blockage . Another big challenge manage sickle cell disease good measure determine change improvement blood flow . Contrast-enhanced ultrasound technique currently use detect blood flow heart , muscle , organ . It extremely sensitive detect blood flow small blood vessel . It would useful help healthcare provider know whether treatment strategy improve blood flow sickle cell blockage . The hypothesis contrast-enhanced ultrasound feasible tool determine change blood flow subject sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease inherit blood disorder affect one every 400 African-Americans newborn United States . Sickle cell disease cause red blood cell change shape round shape half-moon sickle shape . Individuals sickle cell disease different type protein carry oxygen blood ( hemoglobin ) individual without sickle cell disease . This different type hemoglobin make red blood cell change crescent shape certain condition . Sickle shape cell problem often get stuck blood vessel block flow blood , cause inflammation injury important area body . These symptom lead painful occurrence call `` sickle cell crisis '' . Many individual admit hospital pain cause sickle cell crisis . Regadenoson drug may help prevent inflammation injury cause sickle shape cell . This drug approve FDA use bolus heart stress test people unable exercise enough put stress heart make beat faster . In recent Phase I study , safe dose regadenoson determine adult sickle cell disease . This dose give slow IV infusion 24-48 hour period . Hydroxyurea FDA approve drug treatment sickle cell disease . Hydroxyurea pill take orally work well useful severe sickle cell crisis . In study researcher use new method , contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEU ) , visualize tiny blood vessel cardiac skeletal muscle . Changes CEU measurement , administration regadenoson examine . Contrast-enhanced ultrasound also perform individual sickle cell crisis . Some individual also undergo CEU sickle cell crisis compare measurement . Lastly CEU result compare individual sickle cell anemia healthy African-Americans . These CEU 's use determine change blood flow tiny blood vessel certain condition . This study want know new method contrast-enhanced ultrasound useful tool physician use individual sickle cell anemia . The researcher also want determine new method CEU use reveal treatment sickle cell anemia work well others .</detailed_description>
