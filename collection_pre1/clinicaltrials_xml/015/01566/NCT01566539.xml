	<brief_summary>The overall objective project explore biological base individual variation cooperative social behavior among normal subject , goal develop hypothesis explain extreme variation manifest mental illness . Cooperative behavior measure interactive social task know Prisoner 's Dilemma ( PD ) Game . There eight specific aim . Aim 1 examine relationship individual variation cooperative behavior individual variation brain function PD game . This accomplish image subject ' brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) play many round PD Game two assume human partner . Aim 2 examine relationship individual variation cooperative behavior individual variation prefrontal cortex anatomy . This aim involve acquire structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan subject measure morphometric variation , well diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) brain scan measure white matter integrity . Aim 3 investigate impact intranasal oxytocin ( OT ) vasopressin ( AVP ) , neuropeptides associate social bonding , cooperative behavior associate brain activity . In placebo-controlled , double-blind experiment , subject randomize one three condition : intranasal oxytocin ( OT ) administration , intranasal vasopressin ( AVP ) administration , intranasal placebo administration . Functional brain activity behavior compare across treatment group . Aim 4 examine effect oxytocin ( OT ) vasopressin ( AVP ) cortisol level . Aim 5 examine relationship individual variation cooperative behavior individual genetic variation . Saliva sample collect subject analysis gene hypothesize influence cooperative social behavior . Aim 6 examine relationship individual variation cooperative behavior individual variation personality , assessed personality test . Aim 7 examine relationship individual variation social intelligence individual variation brain anatomy . Aim 8 use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) test effect vasopressin ( AVP ) neural response face , powerful social signal important emotional communication . Aim 9 use fMRI investigate brain region active empathy perspective-taking task . Aim 10 involves test effect OT empathy-related behavior functional brain activation , use within-subjects placebo-controlled design . Aim 11 investigates role early life experience , spirituality , self-reported prosocial activity , general cognition empathic cooperative behavior . Aim 12 examine neural behavioral effect Lorazepam use challenge agent context iterate PD game healthy control . Aim 13 examine effect OT behavior brain activity unmedicated depressed anxious men context iterate PD game . Aim 14 determine DNA methylation oxytocin receptor gene ( OXTR ) modulate effect intranasal OT cooperative behavior associate brain activity human subject immersed genuine social interaction .</brief_summary>

Hypothesis 3b : In woman , intranasal vasopressin administration : 1 ) increase rate cooperation , 2 ) increase activation OFC decision-making 3 ) increase activation ventral striatum OFC response reciprocate cooperation 4 ) decrease activation anterior insula response unreciprocated cooperation , 5 ) decrease activation DLPFC decision-making . Hypothesis 3c . In men woman , intranasal oxytocin administration 1 ) increase cooperative behavior Prisoner 's Dilemma Game , 2 ) increase activation within OFC decision-making 3 ) increase activation within ventral striatum OFC response reciprocate cooperation 4 ) decrease activation within right anterior insula response unreciprocated cooperation , 5 ) decrease activation within DLPFC decision-making . Hypothesis 4a . Salivary cortisol level increase AVP treated subject decrease OT treat subject relative pre-drug baseline measurement . This change baseline pronounce social interaction PD game . Hypothesis 4b . Baseline plasma CRP level inversely correlate cooperation positively correlate neural response unreciprocated cooperation . Hypothesis 5a . Longer promoter region repeat length AVPR1a , particularly RS3 , associate 1 ) high rate cooperative behavior , 2 ) strong activation region activate intranasal AVP 3 ) strong effect intranasal AVP administration behavior brain activity , presumably due increase receptor expression binding . Hypothesis 5b . OT SNP 's associated autism associate 1 ) decrease rate cooperative behavior , 2 ) weak activation region activate intranasal OT 3 ) weak effect intranasal OT administration behavior brain activity . Hypothesis 5c . The dopamine D4 receptor ( DRD4 ) exon III 4 repeat allele associate 1 ) increase rate cooperation , 2 ) strong activation within ventral striatum VMPFC response reciprocate cooperation . Hypothesis 5d . The long allele serotonin transporter promoter associate 1 ) increase cooperative behavior PD Game , 2 ) increase activation within VMPFC decision-making 3 ) increase activation within ventral striatum VMPFC response reciprocate cooperation 4 ) decrease activation within right anterior insula , amygdala brainstem response unreciprocated cooperation , 5 ) decrease activation within DLPFC decision-making . Hypothesis 5e . The number CAG repeat AR positively correlate cooperative behavior negatively correlate BOLD fMRI response unreciprocated cooperation ( CD ) within amygdala anterior insula . Hypothesis 6a . Cooperative behavior positively correlate Warmth ( E1 ) , Altruism ( A3 ) , Openness Ideas ( O5 ) , Activity ( E4 ) NEO-PIR , Reward Dependence ( RD4 , Dependence ) Persistence ( PS4 , Perfectionism vs. Pragmatism ) TCI . Cooperative behavior negatively correlate angry/hostility ( N2 ) depression ( N3 ) NEO-PIR , Levenson PPI psychopathy score Novelty Seeking ( NS3 , Extravagance v Reward ) TCI . Hypothesis 7a . Social intelligence positively correlate neocortical gray matter volume white matter integrity , particularly within prefrontal cortex . Hypothesis 8a . In male view face male , AVP treatment 1 ) associate increased amygdala , septum , lateral hypothalamus activation 2 ) associate increase functional connectivity amygdala brainstem 3 ) associate increase antisocial response , amplify activation brain circuit involve recognize `` foe '' follow-up scan male face see AVP administration compare male face view placebo administration . Hypothesis 8b . In male view female face , AVP treatment 1 ) increase ventral striatum nucleus accumbens activation , particularly ventral pallidum AVP stimulate affiliative response associate formation emotional attachment 2 ) increase activation within neural circuit affect opposite sex individual pair bond establish , include anterior cingulate insular cortex , notably , ventral pallidum AVP 's long term affiliative effect specifically related emotional attachment mechanism associate pair bond . Hypothesis 8c . In female view female face , AVP treatment 1 ) increase amygdala activation 2 ) increase activation ventral striatum ventral prefrontal , area activate simulation affiliative approach response towards sex friend ( Guroglu et al. , 2008 ) 3 ) increase pattern functional connectivity ventral striatum ventral prefrontal cortex . Hypothesis 8d . In female view male face , AVP treatment 1 ) increase activation prosocial circuit , include ventral striatum ventral prefrontal cortex ( Guroglu et al. , 2008 ) AVP stimulate affiliative response towards men 2 ) increase activation towards male face previously see AVP relative previously see placebo follow-up scan neural circuit associate `` friend '' and/or ally , include posterior cingulate , lateral orbitofrontal cortex , fusiform cortex , leave insula , leave putamen , nucleus accumbens ( Vrticka et al . 2009 Singer et al. , 2004 ) 3 ) increase area activate emotionally attached partner , include anterior cingulate , insular cortex , ventral pallidum ( Fisher et al. , 2006 ) , AVP affect affiliative response towards men .
