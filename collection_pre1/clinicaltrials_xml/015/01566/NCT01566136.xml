	<brief_summary>Hip fracture danger individual 's mobility , independence ability live community . When patient cognitive impairment ( dementia delirium ) recover well go back home often patient cognitive impairment . Therefore , team develop rehabilitation model care patient hip fracture , specifically patient CI . The model care call Patient Centred Rehabilitation Model Care ( PCRM-CI ) . This 3 year study focus compare new model usual rehabilitation care . This study also focus understanding factor could influence use model new rehabilitation unit . The investigator hypothesize patient receive new model care well mobility outcomes time . The investigator collect data 2 hospital , 70 patient receive usual care 70 patient receive care new model . The team invite 60 staff unit manager well . This study help decision maker use research finding make good decision care old Canadians .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Inpatient Rehabilitation Model Care Targeting Patients With Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A hip fracture often catastrophic event significant threat individual 's mobility , independence ability live community . Projections indicate incidence hip fracture increase nearly four-fold 2041 Canada . The course outcomes hip fracture patient often complicate presence dementia delirium , refer cognitive impairment ( CI ) , limit access in-patient rehabilitation . In response concern , member team develop in-patient rehabilitation model care patient hip fracture , specific component model target patient CI ( PCRM-CI ) . The pre-clinical phase I test model complete , preliminary evidence exist patient without CI regain mobility function return previous living arrangement discharge rehabilitation . This propose 3 year study focus phase II , , compare PCRM-CI usual rehabilitation care gain well understanding factor influence implementation model . Decision-making partner proposal identify service gap within local health region relate rehabilitation care patient hip fracture commit sustain model beyond study . This propose research address mandate current funding opportunity improve mobility cognitively impaired elder , enhance capacity research user apply research evidence decision model care contribute improve mobility age old Canadians . Research Objectives : Primary Objective : To determine whether , compare usual care , inpatient rehabilitation model care target community dwell individual hip fracture CI ( dementia and/or delirium ) result improve mobility time discharge inpatient rehabilitation . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) To determine use PCRM-CI person hip fracture CI result : ) improve mobility 6 month post-surgery ; ii ) great improvement physical functioning time discharge inpatient rehabilitation 6 month post-surgery ; iii ) high proportion patient hip fracture return previous live situation community discharge 6 month post-surgery . 2 ) To determine whether PCRM-CI result similar improvement mobility discharge 6 month post-surgery patient without CI . 3 ) To evaluate whether PCRM-CI improve health care provider ' ( HCPs ) attitude , knowledge , satisfaction stress . 4 ) To examine process PCRM-CI implement . Design : A non-equivalent pre-post design use evaluate PCRM-CI compare usual care . All community dwell ( retirement home ) patient follow hip fracture eligible participate . Two facility involve study multi site sampling increase robustness allow comparison contrast site . Study accrual take 16 month complete recruitment data collection 70 hip fracture patient usual care cohort 70 patient PCRM-CI cohort , base sample size attrition estimation phase I . The investigator recruit 60 HCPs unit manager study . Methods : Baseline data collect within 3 day admission rehabilitation . Follow-up occurs within 3 day discharge rehabilitation 6 month post-surgery . Patient evaluation include mobility ( mobility locomotion item FIMM ) , physical function ( motor-FIM ) , live arrangement ( collateral ' informant reply ) . Other variable influence outcomes collect patient include : sex , co-morbidities , age , patient ' level education , social support ( live alone , spouse , ) , pre fracture status ( OARS ) , pre-cognitive status ( IQCODE ) . During patient ' stay rehabilitation , data dementia ( MMSE ) , delirium screening ( CAM ) severity ( Delirium Index ) collect . Lastly , focus group HCPs semi-structured interview unit manager conduct , investigator collect additional data intervention log , field note examine factor influence model implementation . Significance : With age population , research contribute meet emerge health need Canadians improve provision service elder CI .</detailed_description>
