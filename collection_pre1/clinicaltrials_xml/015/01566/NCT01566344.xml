	<brief_summary>Frequent monomorphic premature ventricular complex ( PVCs ) may cause cardiomyopathy ( CMP ) reversible suppression ectopic focus . This study investigate whether PVC suppression therapy improve cardiac function clinical condition patient idiopathic ischemic CMP frequent monomorphic PVCs . For purpose , patient randomize either one two treatment strategy : 1 ) conventional heart failure therapy plus PVC suppression therapy , consist RFCA primary treatment Amiodarone secondary treatment case unsuccessful RFCA , 2 ) conventional heart failure therapy without PVC suppression therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure account substantial morbidity mortality western world . In addition , financial burden associate disease considerable . Prognosis generally poor quality life significantly reduce . The cause heart failure diverse . Identification underlie pathophysiological mechanism essential , specific patient tailor therapy may help improve clinical status individual patient . In addition , patient may potentially reversible cardiomyopathy ( CMP ) . The present study focus role frequent premature ventricular contraction ( PVCs ) cause leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . This potential reversible CMP generally unknown cardiological society . Frequent ventricular ectopy patient without structural heart disease generally think benign find prognostic significance . Suppression PVCs anti-arrhythmic drug catheter ablation therefore usually consider PVCs accompany disable symptom . However , recent data suggest frequent monomorphic PVCs ( symptomatic asymptomatic ) cause form CMP may reversible suppression ectopic focus . Furthermore , high prevalence frequent PVCs patient heart disease suggest PVC-induced CMP may common phenomenon . Suppression frequent monomorphic PVCs improve LV systolic function may therefore emerge new effective treatment strategy patient heart failure . Beta-blockers safe effective anti-arrhythmic agent consider first line therapy suppression PVCs . Most patient HF already take beta-blocker part standard therapy underlying disease . According international guideline , AADs use beta-blockers ineffective , potential adverse ( arrhythmic ) side-effects , especially patient diminish LV function , may even contra-indicated patient group . In patient LV dysfunction frequent monomorphic PVCs refractory beta-blockers , long-term drug therapy potential adverse ( arrhythmic ) side-effects AADs avoid use catheter ablation first alternative treatment . RFCA already frequently apply , widely accept , safe , effective potentially curative treatment symptomatic drug refractory PVCs . It also safely effectively employed patient tachycardia-induced CMP patient PVC-induced CMP . A high acute success rate 93 % low PVC recurrence rate 3 % report . Although recent available data suggest elimination PVC source RFCA improve LV systolic function HF patient , still apply limited fashion indication evidence support weak . The patient series publish far controlled retrospective nature . We intend conduct control , randomize , prospective study careful documentation long-term follow-up evaluate effect PVC suppression therapy ( RFCA primary treatment ) cardiac systolic function patient CMP beta-blocker refractory frequent monomorphic PVCs . This could establish suppression frequent monomorphic PVCs potential curative treatment strategy patient HF .</detailed_description>
