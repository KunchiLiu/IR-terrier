	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study safety effectiveness induction chemotherapy ( ACF ) consist paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( nab-paclitaxel ) , cisplatin fluorouracil follow chemoradiation therapy treat patient stage III-IV squamous cell cancer head neck . ACF may effective way reduce downgrade locally aggressive tumor , improve chance eradication chemoradiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy With ACF Followed Chemoradiation Therapy Adv . Head &amp; Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared standard induction regimen TPF ( docetaxel , cisplatin , 5-FU ) , ACCF ( nab-paclitaxel , cisplatin , cetuximab , 5-FU ) regimen include two therapeutic change : nab-paclitaxel substitute docetaxel cetuximab add . The investigator propose eliminate cetuximab ACCF regimen isolate treatment effect nab-paclitaxel give cisplatin 5-FU . The primary objective ACF proposal determine complete ( CR ) rate clinical examination primary tumor site follow two cycle ACF . An important secondary objective compare tumor response rate primary site follow two cycle ACF historical experience follow two cycle ACCF ( protocol # ABX 218/HRPO # 08-0911 ) . In addition , investigator compare adverse event ( AEs ) patient receive ACF historical group give ACCF . From two comparison , aim determine either ACF ACCF superior base balance efficacy ( use surrogate prognostic endpoint CR rate primary tumor site ) toxicity .</detailed_description>
