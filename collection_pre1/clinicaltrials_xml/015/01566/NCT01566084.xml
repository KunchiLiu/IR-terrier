	<brief_title>Efficacy Dietary Sodium Restriction Improving Vascular Endothelial Function Middle Aged Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The improvement blood vessel function determine 10 week period . Subjects randomly assign either 'low salt ' condition ( placebo pill + 1200 mg dietary sodium ) 'normal salt ' condition ( 2300 mg sodium chloride pill + 1200 mg dietary sodium ) monitor 5 week . After initial set 5 week , subject switch opposite condition , complete cross-over study design . During week 1-4 6-9 , subject monitor weekly 24 hour urine collection diet log . The assessment primary outcome ( blood vessel function ) complete week 5 10 . BH4 ascorbic acid also administer week 5 10 measure effect sodium intake endogenous BH4 level vascular oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
