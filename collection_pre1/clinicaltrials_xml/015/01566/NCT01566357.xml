	<brief_title>Impact Milk Erosion/Abrasion Enamel Dentin - Situ Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental erosion define pathogenic , chronic , chemical removal dental hard tissue due frequent contact extrinsic intrinsic acid . The dissolution process determine pH , chelate property , mineral content kind acid , time modify various biological ( e.g . saliva , pellicle ) behavioural factor . The anticariogenic property milk widely investigate , information effect milk milk component development erosion limit . It suggest demineralisation process reduce presence calcium phosphate , also casein protein affect demineralisation adsorb hydroxyapatite surface inhibit dissolution . Initial study suggest milk able increase rehardening acid-softened enamel , information effect milk dentin erosion available yet . Particularly , effect fluoridate milk dental erosion investigate yet . In contrast , recent study analyse effect product contain casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) erosion , suggest CPP-ACP promotes supersaturated state increase remineralisation demineralise dental hard tissue . However , situ study effect CPP-ACP erosion limit one study , compare microhardness enamel treatment CPP-ACP CPP-ACP 900 ppm fluoride , fail use appropriate control form product contain calcium phosphate fluoride . In summary , effect milk , particular fluoridate milk , product contain milk protein , casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate , erosive wear analyse in-situ-model far .</detailed_description>
