	<brief_title>MRI/TRUS Fusion Guided Prostate Biopsy- An Improved Way Detect Quantify Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy target lesion surgery may limit visibility target procedure . The successful outcome surgical intervention depend upon accurate device placement , may challenge certain setting , kidney tumor visible brief moment transient arterial phase contrast injection , soon disappear dynamic imaging . Historically , prostate cancer diagnose digitally guide trans-rectal prostate biopsy . With PSA ( Prostate SPecific Antigen ) screen improvement ultrasonography , trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guide prostate biopsy become standard care screen diagnose localized prostate cancer . Standard US 12-14 core prostate biopsy common practice , detect cancer 27 % 44 % patient . Prostate MR image addition endorectal-coil probe 3 Tesla magnet dramatically improve diagnostic utility dramatically biopsies difficult , time-consuming , require specialized equipment , increase cost significantly . To meet challenge TRUS image overlay previously obtain prostate MRI , combine electromagnetic tracking system . The urologist performs direct prostate biopsy MR-identified target addition standard 12-14 core biopsy . This study consist comparison standard care ( TRUS guide prostate biopsy ) protocol biopsy consist TRUS guide prostate biopsy MR/US fusion track prostate biopsy . Each patient act control .</detailed_description>
