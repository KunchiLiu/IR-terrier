	<brief_summary>The study consist determine whether melatonin decrease oxidative stress Barrett 's esophageal mucosa 6 month treatment . In order achieve clinical trial , patient randomize two possible arm : omeprazole alone omeprazole plus melatonin . The patient follow around four visit six month . GERD one prevalent pathology digestive tract . Barrett 's esophagus , complication chronic GERD , attract attention researcher due condition pre-neoplastic lesion . At present , treatment Barrett 's patient limit acid inhibition PPIs . Although several study indicate treatment PPIs could decrease incidence high grade dysplasia EAC , treatment PPIs eliminate risk EAC patient . Therefore , necessary find chemo-preventive agent stop neoplastic progression Barrett 's esophagus . Among , antioxidant become promising agent . This pilot study determine efficacy melatonin chemoprevention EAC . So , main objective study determine whether melatonin decrease oxidative stress Barrett 's esophageal mucosa 6 month treatment . To evaluate whether melatonin modifies mechanisms associate neoplastic progression BE patient : proliferation apoptotic index molecular marker progression : 17pLOH , 9pLOH , p16 methylation DNA ploidy ( tetraploidy and/or aneuploidy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melatonin Associated Acid Inhibition Chemoprevention Barret Esophagus : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) chronic disease secondary presence stomach acid esophagus . This atypical situation produce inflammation ulceration distal esophagus mucosa . It main factor predispose development esophageal adenocarcinoma , poor prognosis . At present , therapy Barrett 's esophagus base acid secretion inhibition proton pump inhibitor , effective therapy reduce gastroesophageal reflux . However , therapy completely eliminate risk . Therefore , good way follow disorder perform periodic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy biopsy . Therefore , necessary find new chemo-preventive agent avoid efficiently neoplastic progression BE . New advance knowledge BE suggest antioxidant could use reduce disorder development . These drug use long time ago different pathology lot country . One drug melatonin , combine several characteristic suggest could suitable antioxidant . It adverse effect report . Patients meet follow characteristic include clinical study : Patients ( male female ) Barrett 's esophagus ( &gt; 18 year &lt; 80 ) without macroscopic esophagitis endoscopy length metaplasic mucosa 2 cm longer . By way , patient exclude study present carcinoma high grade dysplasia basal endoscopy , previous gastric esophageal surgery , patient NSAID aspirin treatment , neoplastic malignancy , hematological serious disease ( coagulation disorder anemia Hb &lt; 9.5 gr/dL ) , serious/moderate cardiac , liver renal disease , need corticosteroid therapy ( minimum 5 day per month allow , well topical inhale treatment ) , patient misoprostol anticoagulant , patient inflammatory bowel disease allergy investigational drug . Patients , agree participate study meet criterion , randomize one two follow therapy : omeprazole alone omeprazole + Circadin ( melatonin. ) . This intervention hardly produce adverse effect , frequent adverse effect proton pump inhibitor headache stomach ache . For melatonin report adverse effect . This study do Hospital Clinico Lozano Blesa ( Zaragoza , Spain ) , promote Health Science Aragon Institute principal investigator Angel Lanas Arbeloa ( Digestive Disease Service ) . It start March-april 2012 finish 12 month later approximately . The study sponsor I+CS ( Aragon Institute Health Sciences ) carry cost trial .</detailed_description>
