	<brief_summary>Safety natural , vaginal labor parturient , fetus newborn one important goal among obstetrician , midwife , scientific society world . Maternal newborn clinical problem complication follow vaginal delivery cause big amount medico-legal problem high cost sanitary field . Among maneuver use second stage labor , uterine fundal pressure one controversial often diffuse world , generally document , report medical record . Many Authors affirms different new way push may help . This maneuver introduce Kristeller , 1867 minutely described procedure shorten , application pressure uterine fundus whose intensity quantify dynamometer duration measure second , length second phase labor . Although uterine fundal pressure maneuver describe Kristeller placement two hand uterine fundus consequential application longitudinal steady pressure 30- 45-degree angle direct toward pelvis , avoidance direct pressure toward maternal spine , clear definition maneuver indication use formally describe date . The aim study therefore ass whether use Baby-guardTM system , ergonomic , three chamber , inflatable abdominal belt , engineer study biomechanics biophysics , follow obstetric semiotics , applies fundal pressure second stage labor direction pelvic outlet , may maternal fetus aid safe natural childbirth well outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safe Delivery Using Belt Belly Pregnant Woman</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize , single blind , control , prospective study perform . Subjects nulliparous woman deliver community set hospital ( U.O.C . Obstetrics Gynecology , `` San Giuseppe '' Hospital , Empoli , Italy ) January 24 , 2011 March 24 , 2011 . Vaginal delivery eligible . Patients therefore divide two group randomly number envelope upon full dilatation cervix , allocate follow two group : 1 . The Study Group ( n=40 patient ) inflatable belt apply correct pressure ( range 80 150 mm/Hg , see description protocol ) Labor Delivery 2 . The Control Group ( n=40 woman ) , belt inflate minimal pressure ( 10 20 mm/Hg ) During Labor Delivery To test whether difference experimental group statistically significant , sample-size calculate `` priori '' . To , primary end-point identify : incidence perineal-cervical laceration . The sample-size ( n &gt; 62 subject two group ) obtain use STATA program two-tailed test [ alpha level 0.05 90 % statistical power ( 1-Beta ) ] , detect statistically significant reduction 50 % 10 % less respect primary end-point . Therefore randomize sample size 40 pregnant woman per group choose allow possible refusal withdrawal . Data collect delivery record , retrospectively obtain review , include : patient 's age , race , parity , patient 's body mass index ( BMI , kg/m2 ) time delivery , body weight change pregnancy ( define difference maternal pre-pregnant body weight body weight delivery ) , part ante-partum information . For intra-partum information , gestational age delivery , duration second phase labor , use intravenous oxytocin , episiotomy , cervical laceration ( require surgical repair hemostasis ) , severe perineal laceration ( define third- fourth- laceration , mild perineal laceration defend first- second- perineal laceration ) , vacuum extraction , forceps delivery , use uterine fundal pressure maneuver abstract . All The study Group follow 15 day delivery Fetal weight estimate combination biparietal diameter , abdominal circumference femur length . The mean percent difference predict actual weight 9.6 % correspond mean overestimation 294 g underestimation 314 g. These value consistent report literature . The study perform accord guideline International Conference Harmonisation Technical Requirements Registration Pharmaceuticals Human Use ( ICH ) ; declaration Helsinki regard Standard operating procedure clinical investigator ( GCP ) ; General requirement Clinical investigation medical device human subject . Finally , local ethical committee approve study protocol , patient receive detailed information study procedure , give write consent . The inflatable belt ( Baby-guardTM ) study protocol The Baby-guardTM ( CABEL s.a.s . Costruzioni Elettroniche , Pistoia , Italy ) consist disposable , ergonomic , three chamber , inflatable belt , detector electro-physiological signal maternal abdomen ( i.e . fetal heart maternal heart signal - Figure 1 ) . myographic uterine activity ) . Three chamber separately swell one order reposition fetal body compose inflatable belt . The three belt chamber fill accord pressure set operator ( midwife/MD ) allow gently position fetus wright position towards pelvis . Once correct fetal position obtain , three chamber inflate synchronously uterine contraction . The maternal fetal monitoring unit compose touch-screen computer , record electro-physiological signal collect signal amplifier derive mother ( uterine contraction maternal heart rate ) fetus ( fetal heart rate possibility Doppler parameter fetal heart ) . All parameter signal detect Baby-guardTM system storable touch-screen computer hard disk , per request European Community rule safety ( UNI EN60601 ) ] . This study report part regard result outcomes parturient neonate . At begin uterine contraction , refer patient reveal electro-physiological signal record , midwife/MD , necessary , inflated 30-50 mmHg air pressure lateral chamber inflatable belt correctly align fetus avoid malpositioning respect pelvis . After monitor duration spontaneous uterine contraction , midwife/MD therefore inflate 80 150 mm/Hg ( Study Group ) 10 20 mm/Hg ( Control Group ) air ergonomic belt 30 sec . Fundal pressure apply 30-40° angle spine direction pelvic outlet inflatable belt , standardize force surface area application ( 980 cm2 ) . The frequency inflation limit few 6 time per 20 min . follow pause 10 min . All woman , whether randomize Study Control group , receive standard management second stage labor , include one-to-one support , fetal heart rate monitoring , care midwife . Operative delivery perform clinically indicate . As uterine contraction start , inflatable obstetric belt inflate synchronously maintain pressure indicate 30 sec . midwife/MD . The Baby-guardTM use 2 hour till delivery . The obstetrician , midwife patient blind whether belt inflate sufficient pressure ( 80 150 mm/Hg Study Group ) ( 10 20 mm/Hg Control Group ) . Outcomes study Outcome measure study perineal cervical laceration incidence , use uterine fundal pressure maneuver ( Kristeller manouvre ) , incidence vacuum extraction , cesarean section incidence labor , second stage labor duration ; maternal psychological physical fatigue , maternal request cesarean section labor , absence neonatal intensive care unit admission . At time discharge home , patient ' satisfaction inflatable belt evaluate ask score degree psychological physical fatigue Baby-guardTM mark 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0 ( minimal ) 10 ( optimal ) . Patients also ask usefulness inflatable belt assistance delivery . The number cesarean section request second phase labor also evaluate . Statistical analysis All data analyze STATA software ( StataCorp LP , College Station , Texas , USA ) , express mean ± SD ( range ) number ( % ) case . Comparisons proportion mean group ( study v control ) do use χ2 test ( Fisher exact test , suitable ) , independent t-test , respectively .</detailed_description>
