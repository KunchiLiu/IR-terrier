	<brief_summary>Rationale objective : Based result pilot study , objective present study evaluate whether buttermilk lower serum LDL cholesterol concentration prevent serum LDL cholesterol raise effect egg . Study Design : The study randomize placebo-controlled factorial 2x2 design . The total study duration 14 week , consist 2 week run-in period 12 week experimental period . Subjects stratify age , gender BMI experimental group . Study population : One hundred eight healthy male female subject , age 18-70 year , slightly elevate serum total cholesterol concentration ( 5.5-8.0 mmol/l ) . Intervention : During entire study period , volunteer instruct consume diet accord Dutch dietary guideline ( 35 en % fat ( 10 en % saturated fat ) , 50-55 en % carbohydrates ) . During two week run-in period subject drink daily lunch 100 mL skim milk . During 12 week experimental period , first group subject continue drink skim milk ( control group ) , second group consume low-fat buttermilk , third group skim milk enrich egg-yolk , fourth group egg-yolk incorporate low-fat buttermilk base beverage . The egg-yolk enriched lutein . Whole egg consumption ( others provide u ) allow entire study . Main study parameters/endpoints : Measurements perform run-in period ( day 0 , 11 14 ) experimental period ( day 56 , 95 98 ) . The main effect ( egg-yolk buttermilk consumption ) calculate absolute difference value obtain end experimental ( average day 95 98 ) run-in ( average day 11 14 ) period . The primary endpoint change serum LDL cholesterol concentration . Secondary endpoint change serum total HDL cholesterol , triacylglycerol , apoA-I , apoB hsCRP concentration .</brief_summary>
