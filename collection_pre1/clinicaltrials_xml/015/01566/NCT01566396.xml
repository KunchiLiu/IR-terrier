	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy 3F Applicator ( A3F ) Treatment Facial Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need cosmetic facial enhancement procedure minimal time low risk lead development method non-surgical skin rejuvenation . Various ablative laser develop , remove full skin surface control manner1,2 . However , prolonged recovery significant risk prompt development fractional laser ablate skin fractional manner , leave untreated area improve heal process3 . In past year , fractional RF system introduce enable controlled skin resurface accompany dermal collagen remodeling4,5,6 . The new 3F Applicator ( A3F , trade name TriFractional ) Pollogenâ„¢ design enable skin resurface treatment wrinkle use radiofrequency energy . The 3F Applicator ( A3F ) indicate use dermatological procedure require ablation resurface skin , treatment facial wrinkle . This study design order evaluate safety efficacy A3F treatment facial wrinkle .</detailed_description>
