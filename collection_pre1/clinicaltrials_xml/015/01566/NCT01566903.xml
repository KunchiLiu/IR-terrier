	<brief_summary>MR angiography ( MRA ) become essential treatment neurovascular disease , include ischemic stroke - first cause disability occidental country , vascular malformation aneurysm , arteriovenous fistula malformation , whose treatment improve year year . MRA alternative digital substracted angiography ( DSA ) , circumvent th use endovascular catheterism , irradiation injection iodinate contrast agent . Contrast-Enhanced MRA ( CE-MRA ) gadolinium injection currently reference standard vascular MR exploration still present many limitation inherent injection contrast medium . Hence , synchronization acquisition bolus contrast injection limit improvement spatial temporal resolution require accurate synchronization acquisition arrival bolus . Moreover , acquisition repeat required require contrast injection . Besides , increase nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical case , would secondary gadolinium chelate injection , patient chronic renal insufficiency restrict use CE-MRA . More 500 case describe date world . Its occurrence currently estimate around 4 % patient terminal chronic renal insufficiency mortality around 30 % . According recommendation AFSSAPS August , 2007 , two gadolinium contrast agent ( Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN * , General Electric HealthCare Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST * , Bayer HealthCare ) contraindicate glomerular filtration rate lower 30 ml/mn . Non-contrast enhance MR angiography ( NCE MRA ) technique propose provide complete non-invasive investigation vasculature , thus offer patient chronic renal insufficiency , well pregnant nursing woman surrogate side effect . Moreover , use high field ( 3T ) MR image offer improve signal noise ratio . Combined use phase array coil parallel image , new NCE MRA sequence achieve juxta-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution temporal resolution 50 m close cerebral DSA . These sequence allow joint hemodynamical morphological assessment lesion , cervical cerebral level , whether diagnosis patient follow-up</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective evaluate quality NCE image obtain exploration neurovascular disease , cervical cerebral level . Secondary objective : - compare NCE MRA sequence CE MRA sequence use clinical routine . - evaluate anatomic hemodynamic change observable sequence follow-up patient , particularly treat partial embolization radiosurgery . By circumvent limitation short bolus duration synchronization , new dynamic sequence potential achieve high temporal resolution without compromise spatial resolution . Arteries arteriovenous shunt may precisely identify , due good visibility small vessel allow accurate dynamic analysis . Finally , sequence derive arterial spin labeling , differ time flight phase contrast sequence , allow exploration less dependent vascular geometry well anatomical analysis . For example , tendency overestimate arterial stenosis could reduce . The robustness sequence allow non-invasive monitoring patient include possible monitor hemodynamic change radiosurgery embolization .</detailed_description>
