	<brief_summary>Oral mucositis ( inflammation line mouth ) common adverse effect chemotherapy radiation therapy use treat cancer . Mucositis occur 40 % patient receive standard dose chemotherapy , 80 % patient receive radiation therapy head neck , 100 % patient undergo bone marrow transplant . Because pain mucositis bad cause inability eat drink , inability talk , gag drool . Many time mucositis affect cancer treatment patient may give low dose drug stop treatment completely . There many treatment today help relieve severe pain cause mucositis . This research study help researcher determine use oral mouthwash call Ketamine help lessen mucositis pain . Ketamine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use general anesthesia , sedation severe pain . WVU Hospital use Ketamine mouthwash standard treatment option mucositis pain . During study patient assess determine level pain cause mucositis . This occur first dose , one hour first dose , daily longer study . Patients use mouthwash swishing spitting ( 20mg/5ml ) four time day , also every four hour need . Patients use mouthwash study mucositis get good mucositis get bad ( pain get good three day treatment ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mucositis Mucositis adverse effect result chemotherapy radiation treatment significant quality life clinical consequence . Mucositis result direct cytotoxic damage well cytokine-mediated inflammatory response affect epithelial mucosal surface along entire gastrointestinal tract . Mucositis manifest oral cavity especially distress patient may involve erythema , crack , inflammation , bleed ulceration typically begin 5-10 day start chemotherapy . Mucositis occur 40 % patient receive standard dose chemotherapy , 80 % patient receive radiation therapy head neck , 100 % patient undergo bone marrow transplant . ( 1 ) Pain oral mucositis report single debilitate side effect patient receive bone marrow transplant . Mucositis also common condition require analgesic cancer therapy . Complications pain mucositis include inability tolerate food fluid intake , difficulty inability talk , excess mucus , gag , sleep disturbance , drool . Mucositis may also require hospital admission extend admission total parenteral nutrition , intravenous analgesia , and/or intravenous antibiotic . Seventy percent patient grade 3 4 mucositis require feeding tube . Mucositis also potential impact effectiveness cancer treatment dose-limiting toxicity result cessation reduction treatment 35 % patient ( 2,3,4 ) Current standard care focus palliation include systemic opiate analgesic moderate severe mucositis pain , topical anesthetic mucosal coat agent lidocaine , benzocaine , dyclonine , diphenhydramine , doxepin , benzydamine moderate pain , bland rinse mild pain . Data support management option limit . Other agent investigate variable response oral capsaicin , oral sulfasalazine , growth factor mouthwash . ( 5 ) Ketamine Ketamine sedative hypnotic anesthetic analgesic property . Ketamine work selectively depressing thalamoneocortical system , non-competitively block N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , intrinsic sympathomimetic activity . Ketamine also appear selectively interrupt association pathway brain produce somatesthetic sensory blockade . Ketamine FDA-approved induction maintenance general anesthesia also use procedural sedation , refractory severe pain , acute respiratory failure child . ( 6 ) Topical administration ketamine show cause reduction allodynia double-blind placebo control study peripheral administration ketamine antinociceptive efficacy similar systemic administration likely mediate NMDA antagonism ( 7 ) . Ketamine may also potentiate effect systemic opioid analgesic may reverse opiate tolerance degree . Also , give topical administration opiates local effect , topical ketamine may produce local tolerance reversal . Ketamine also modest anti-inflammatory property could provide beneficial effect mucositis pain relief . ( 8 ) Ketamine oral rinse use describe case report 32 year old female radiation-induced mucositis pain refractory Clark 's solution , transdermal fentanyl , intravenous hydromorphone . Ketamine oral rinse give 20mg drug 5ml artificial saliva solution every 3 hour need continue PCA use . She experience decreased pain rest eat able decrease dose opiate analgesic . Her overall pain report decrease 9/10 3/10 oral ketamine use . No adverse effect report one episode swallow solution result transient sedative psychomotor effect . ( 8 ) A retrospective chart review ketamine mouthwash use 8 patient period 4 year conduct determine safety efficacy . Patients review receive ketamine 20mg/5ml mouthwash every 4 hour need . Seven 8 patient post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( post-HSCT ) patient . Five patient documented improvement mucositis pain 4 patient experienced adverse event . Adverse event consist mild confusion , nausea , vertigo , hallucination ; however 2 4 patient report symptom prior begin ketamine mouthwash still include analysis . Patients receive average 17 dos average 6 day . Reporting pain score variable difficult quantify author conclude ketamine may provide viable treatment option mucositis pain . ( 9 ) Rationale study Evidence use oral ketamine rinse suggest could provide distinct benefit patient suffer pain clinical consequence mucositis result cancer treatment . No treatment currently available provide profound relief pain available evidence suggest ketamine could useful tool arsenal agent available patient . Ketamine mouthwash approve WVUH Pharmacy Nutrition Therapeutics ( PNT ) Committee treatment option mucositis pain . It commercially available currently use hospital . No prospective data exists objectively evaluate potential benefit possible adverse effect ketamine oral rinse . We postulate use ketamine oral mouthwash provide pain relief patient significant distress due pain oral mucositis .</detailed_description>
