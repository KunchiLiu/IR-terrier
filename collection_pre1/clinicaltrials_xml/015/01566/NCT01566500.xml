	<brief_summary>There urgent need understand psychological situational factor influence medication adherence individual epilepsy . According Center Disease Control ( CDC , 2010 ) 2.5 million people United States epilepsy one third still seizures despite receive treatment . With proper medication , estimate 60-70 % individual new onset epilepsy become , remain , seizure free ( Kwan &amp; Brodie , 2000 ) . Despite success medical treatment epilepsy , many patient receive benefit due inadequate adherence medication ( Meyer et al. , 2010 ) . And , chronic medical condition , estimate suggest 30 % 60 % patient epilepsy adherent drug regimen ( Green &amp; Simons Morton , 1988 ; Leppik , 1990 ; Jones et al. , 2006 ) . Poor adherence may important cause poorly control epilepsy ( Gomes et al. , 1998 ) . Stanaway et al . ( 1985 ) find 31 % seizure precipitate nonadherence medication . Questions regard adherence theoretically inform Fisher et al . ( 2006 ) 's Information Motivation Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) model . While originally develop describe , predict , inform intervention antiretroviral treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , study applies model epilepsy first time . In addition , study intend produce accurate description individual epilepsy manage medication adherence identify current self regulation strategy ( immediate adherence behavior , preparatory behavior , barrier management strategy ) situational determinant . Situational determinant explain fluctuation medication adherence . Patients motivate take medication might still show inconsistent medication adherence . For example , patient might miss good opportunity take medication fail anticipate unexpected barrier spontaneous dinner friend bout depression . Therefore , study take particular care investigate situational cue good opportunity adherence ( e.g. , take medication regular meal brush teeth ) expect unexpected barrier . Preparatory behavior cue also interest study : Some patient use facilitator ( physical electronic reminder system , electronic pill bottle pill box ) ensure adequate medication adherence . Social support serve similar function reminding patient take medication . To address question , investigator plan explore individual regulation social support influence medication adherence patient epilepsy . The specific aim propose research : 1 . To test hypothesis main effect information , motivation behavioral skill , adherence behavior , mediation model show information motivation effect partially mediate behavioral skill . 2 . To identify self regulation strategy situational cue ( good opportunity , facilitator , barrier ) medication adherence among individual epilepsy good describe best practice challenge .</brief_summary>
