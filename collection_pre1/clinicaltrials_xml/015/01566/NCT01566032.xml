	<brief_summary>The amount air leak chest tube measure two main way : 1. electronic monitor connect chest tube 2. numerical ( non-electronic ) monitor connect chest tube For people lung surgery , important understand impact measure air leak accurately short term long term . An electronic medical device call Thopaz measure air leak electronically . Another medical device call Pleur-evac measure air leak numerically . The purpose study understand accuracy method use doctor nurse determine chest tube air leak . It also important determine size severity air leak .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Versus Analog Pleural Drainage Patients With Pulmonary Air Leak</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients air leak follow lung surgery assess target number 6 observer ( three nurse three MDs ) randomly ask participate . Patients first connect numerical air leak detector , follow electronic air leak detector . Observers record responses device . They blind response observer .</detailed_description>
