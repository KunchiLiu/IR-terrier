	<brief_summary>Local control rate patient retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma ( RSTS ) remain disappointing even gross total resection , mainly wide margin achievable majority patient . In contrast extremity sarcoma , postoperative radiation therapy ( RT ) show limited efficacy due limitation achievable dose coverage . Although Intraoperative Radiation Therapy ( IORT ) introduce center overcome dose limitation result improved outcome , local failure rate still high even considerable treatment relate toxicity accept . As postoperative administration RT general disadvantage , neoadjuvant approach could offer benefit term dose escalation , target coverage reduction toxicity , especially highly conformal technique like intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) consider . Therefore RETROWTS trial design prospective , one armed , single center phase I/II study investigate combination neoadjuvant dose-escalated IMRT ( 50-56 Gy ) follow surgery IORT ( 10-12 Gy ) patient least marginally resectable RSTS . The primary objective local control rate five year . Secondary endpoint progression-free overall survival , acute late toxicity , surgical resectability pattern failure . The aim accrual 37 patient per-protocol population .</brief_summary>
