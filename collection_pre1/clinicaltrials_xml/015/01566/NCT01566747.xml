	<brief_summary>This phase II open label , single arm study evaluate treatment pazopanib post sunitinib treatment 43 patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Patients receive 800mg pazopanib per day give continuously disease progression . Patients must receive treatment sunitinib relapse . Patient must receive prior treatment sunitinib least 12 week . Prior treatment either temsirolimus everolimus addition sunitinib allow . The trial design use Simons two stage design interim analysis plan first 15 evaluable patient . If 8 first 15 evaluable patient remain disease free 4 month , 28 patient enrol total 43 metastatic renal cell cancer patient . It estimate could 10 % patient drop achieve require number 43 evaluable patient study recruit 48 patient ensure 43 complete stage 2 require . Patients receive treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal patient consent . Response assessment carry every 8 week disease progression . Safety assessment carry every 4 week ( plus visit liver function test 2 week ) first six month every eight week disease progression . A safety assessment carry 4 week treatment discontinuation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment , must willing comply treatment follow . Procedures conduct part subject 's routine clinical management ( e.g. , blood count , image study ) obtain prior signing inform consent may utilize screen baseline purpose provide procedure conduct specify protocol . Note : It necessary inform consent obtain within protocolspecified screen window . 2 . Age ≥ 18 year 3 . Diagnosis metastatic/unresectable renal cell carcinoma clear cell type component clear cell histology 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 5 . Measurable disease RECIST criterion ( Version 1.1 ) 6 . Eligible patient must treat sunitinib minimum 12 week ( 2 cycle ) . Patients must evidence progressive disease follow treatment sunitinib assess site investigator basis CT scan appropriate clinical documentation . Patients receive sunitinib 12 week ( 2cycles ) stop drug due toxicity rather disease progression also eligible study . The Investigator aware patient 's intolerance/toxicity prior sunitinib treatment take account assess eligibility pazopanib study . Patients prior treatment either temsirolimus everolimus also eligible trial . No prior treatment bevacizumab , sorafenib , immunotherapy , chemotherapy , biologic therapy investigational therapy allow . Previous radiotherapy ( RT ) permissible provide measurable disease outside RT port . RT must complete &gt; 2 week prior registration . 7 .
