	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) grow disease public health concern , projection future effect alarming . About one third affect develop diabetic nephropathy 20 year diagnosis . Of patient , 20 % develop clinically end-stage renal disease ESRD , require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . Patients type 2 diabetes account patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) RRT . To best investigator knowledge , effect MMF diabetic nephropathy patient DM type II study far . Therefore , purpose pilot study evaluate effect Mofetil Mycophenolate ( MMF ) proteinuria progression kidney disease diabetic origin , patient high risk progressive renal failure treatment modality insufficient fail .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology diabetic nephropathy initially consider merely secondary non-immune mechanism , specifically due metabolic ( hyperglycemia ) hemodynamic ( glomerular capillary hypertension - mechanical stretching ) factor . However , understand pathophysiological process lead diabetic nephropathy progression clearer involve non immune mechanism , also immune-mediated inflammatory mechanism . Activation immune system , participation chronic inflammatory state , play central role pathogenesis diabetic nephropathy . Evidence involvement immune system pathogenesis diabetic nephropathy derive elevated level proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-18 , TNF-α . These factor important predictor development diabetic nephropathy , recently show inflammatory cytokine play determinant role development progression microvascular diabetic nephropathy . The first publish study show implication inflammatory cytokine pathogenesis diabetic nephropathy 1991 . Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) immunosuppressant drug , use prevent rejection , especially acute rejection various organ transplantation , mainly kidney transplantation since 1995 . In last decade increase report describe beneficial use MMF immune- mediate auto-immune disorder Systemic Lupus Erythematosus , IGA nephropathy glomerulopathies . Unfortunately , potentially beneficial effect MMF diabetic nephropathy examine clinical DM limit diabetic rat . In recent study , Utimura et al . demonstrate MMF largely prevent development albuminuria glomerular injury experimental diabetic nephropathy . The beneficial effect MMF relate action glomerular hemodynamic improvement metabolic control , probably relate directly immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory property .</detailed_description>
