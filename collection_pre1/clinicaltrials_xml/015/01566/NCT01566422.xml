	<brief_summary>Despite use prophylactic systemic antibiotic improved surgical technique , surgical site infection remain serious concern . The incidence deep infection spine surgery lower systemic antibiotic , yet instrument fusion traumatic injury infection rate remain high 10 % . The impact patient cost treat infection profound . With diminish healthcare dollar policy refuse reimburse postoperative infection , critical physician hospital system seek cost effective way decrease postoperative infection . Local delivery antibiotic surgical site find significantly decrease infection rate undergo posterior spine fusion traumatic injury study retrospective manner investigator grant . In proposal investigator prospectively randomize patient undergo posterior spinal stabilization traumatic injury either receive vancomycin powder surgical site ( treatment ) versus receive vancomycin powder ( control ) subsequently follow infection rate , complication , cost care . The investigator 's hypothesis ) vancomycin powder decrease infection rate ii ) systemic toxicity iii ) cost save advancement safety deliver spine surgical care .</brief_summary>
