	<brief_title>Use Neovasc Coronary Sinus Reducer System Treatment Refractory Angina Pectoris Patients With Ngina Class 3-4 Who Are Not Candidates Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Interventional , Allocation : Open label , Primary Purpose : Treatment - Diagnosis treatment device require : Patients advance obstructive coronary artery disease severe disable refractory angina despite optimal medical therapy . No revascularization option available . - Why unlicensed device chosen license device conventional therapy particular patient ? Patient currently treat optimal medical therapy include : long act nitrate , beta blocker , calcium channel blocker . The patient amendable re-do bypass graft surgery , amendable percutaneous coronary intervention , determine recent coronary angiography . There licensed device effectively ameliorate refractory angina reduce number angina episode improve quality life . -The current device use 25 patient date . Safety information 6 month publish ( JACC 2007 ; 49:1783 ) . Extended safety efficacy information 3 year report March 2010 ( ACC Annual Scientific conference ) . The device associate procedure-related adverse event follow-up period . Risks ( theoretical ) : •Coronary sinus dissection time implantation . •Coronary sinus perforation acute cardiac tamponade require drainage . •Device migration embolization . •Late coronary sinus occlusion These risk report patient receieved device . Benefits : •Reduce angina severity . •Improve quality life . •Reduction intensity medical therapy decrease side effect . •Reduced incidence hospital admission , emergency room visit outpatient clinic visit refractory angina . •Improved leave ventricular function , reduce LV end diastolic pressure . These patient poor quality life . They disable unable work perform basic daily activity . Cannulation coronary sinus present procedural risk similar pacemaker electrode insertion , procedure frequently perform Interventional cardiology . For particular patient poor quality life , offer technology potentially make active , productive , less dependent medication health system .</detailed_description>
