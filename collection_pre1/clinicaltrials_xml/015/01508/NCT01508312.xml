	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine 2 cycle SGN-35 use instead ICE prior autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) relapse refractory HL . There 2 step treat patient relapsed refractory HL . The first step shrink lymphoma chemotherapy . The chemotherapy regimen commonly use call ICE . ICE combination chemotherapy drug : ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide . The second step treatment give high dos chemotherapy radiation therapy follow infusion stem cell . This call ASCT . This study focus first step treatment relapse refractory HL . ICE chemotherapy cause many side effect . We believe patient receive less toxic treatment still well . We learn past study [ 18F ] FDG-PET scan ( call `` PET scan '' ) use predict well ASCT . PET scan test use measure metabolic activity disease . Patients without abnormal activity PET scan ( negative PET scan ) ASCT much likely cured activity PET scan ( positive PET scan ) . In study , instead begin ICE chemotherapy , patient receive new drug call Brentuximab vedotin ( SGN-35 ) . SGN-35 type drug call antibody drug conjugate . SGN-35 2 part ; part target cancer cell ( antibody ) cell kill part ( chemotherapy ) . The antibody part SGN-35 stick target call CD30 . CD30 important molecule cancer cell ( include Hodgkin lymphoma ) normal cell immune system . The cell kill part SGN-35 chemotherapy call monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) . It kill cell antibody part SGN-35 stick . Compared ICE chemotherapy , SGN-has few side effect require inpatient admission treatment . We aim determine whether patient avoid treatment ICE prior ASCT . We use result PET scan determine whether patient need additional chemotherapy ASCT . If PET scan negative , patient refer ASCT receive ICE chemotherapy . If PET scan positive , physician discus treatment option patient .</brief_summary>
