	<detailed_description>The Masimo SpHbâ„¢ ( SpHb ) device use monitor blood hemoglobin level via sticky sensor connect finger . Our result 2 recent study undertake device conclude : 1 ) always accurate finger cold surgical blood loss , 2 ) local nerve block finger improve finger temperature accuracy device . Our purpose investigate duration effect two local nerve block drug ( lidocaine bupivacaine - FDA approve drug routine use ) finger hand . Having well understand long nerve block last could help determine additional block might necessary maintain accuracy device surgical blood loss . We previously list primary outcome study time return baseline finger temperature . However , blind look data become clear defining time return baseline serial temperature measurement objective fashion would extremely difficult potentially controversial . We modify primary outcome change average temperature baseline post-intervention .</detailed_description>
