	<brief_summary>Calorie restriction experimental manipulation prolongs longevity experimental animal . The life prolong effect calorie restriction relate low incidence tumor le inflammation , importantly , low generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . This effect relate overexpression two group enzymes . One group ( NAD+ ) ‐dependent deacetylases call sirtuins whose main action increase free fatty acid flow adipose tissue , improve insulin secretion promote mitochondrial biogenesis muscle . The group correspond uncoupling protein ( UCP ) , specially UCP 3 reduces mitochondrial production ROS . On hand , effect calorie restriction always report , decrease rest energy expenditure . A reduction activity UCP1 brown adipose tissue could mechanisms explain effect . However sirtuins apparently increase expression UCP1.Recently PET CT scan emerge non invasive methodology recognize brown adipose tissue activity indirectly , UCP1 activity . Also measurement telomere length peripheral blood mononuclear cell consolidate good marker age . Two possible model calorie restriction study human . One retrospective model adult separate maintain stable weight adulthood manner analogous weight clamp model calorie restriction non human primates . This model reliable objective record weight studied subject 20 year ago . In retrospective part project investigator propose study adult whose weight record previously . The investigator pretend compare telomere length expression SIRT1 6 PBMC , plasma 8 isoprostanes carotid intima medium thickness weight maintainer weight gainer . The investigator hypothesis weight maintainer well age profile weight gainer . In prospective part project investigator study human model calorie restriction prescribe 25 % reduction calorie intake 3 month compare group accord weight loss . At baseline end study period , UCP3 SIRT1 expression muscle biopsy , SIRT1 6 expression PBMC brown adipose activity , assess 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake use PET/CT measure . The investigator hypothesis individual subject calorie restriction experience increase expression UCP3 , SIRT1 SIRT6 reduction brown adipose tissue activity . Simultaneously , subject experience reduction oxidative stress marker muscle plasma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS : Calorie restriction delay age process thus telomere erosion , due reduction oxidative stress , via expression modulation uncouple protein sirtuins . RETROSPECTIVE STUDY : Approximately 1000 adult age 40 55 year , participate nutritional assessment study body weight record , body mass index ( BMI ) less 30 kg/m2 time consider eligible . Other source subject recruitment health record arm force personnel institutional data base . Those accept sign write informed consent , subject : 1 . A complete clinical history , record past present disease , medication use , history smoking , drink illicit drug use . 2 . A dietary questionnaire ass nutrient intake 3 . A complete clinical examination include measurement body weight , height , blood pressure . 4 . A physical activity questionnaire previously validate u 1 5 . Measurement body composition DEXA 6 . Withdrawal 10 hour fast blood sample 30 ml measure - Packed red cell volume , blood glucose , creatinine , serum lipid , TSH , thyroid hormone insulin - Telomere length peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) - Sirt1 6 gene expression PBMC . - Plasma 8‐ isoprostanes 7 . Measurement carotid intima medium thickness ultrasound , perform trained professional use previously report protocol . Once evaluate , subject classify : 1 . Weight maintainer actual weight , within 10 % weight record least 10 year 2 . Weight gainer , actual weight 20 % weight previously record The follow excluded analysis : 1 . Subjects history chronic debilitating disease renal failure , cancer , autoimmune disease , hypothyroidism , diabetes mellitus AIDS . 2 . Subjects engage extremely high physical activity ( 10 hour per week sport work require extreme physical activity shovel hard manual work . 3 . Subjects history drug abuse alcoholism 4 . Subjects use anorexigenic anabolic drug , chronic user non steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug . 5 . Subjects smoke 5 cigarette per day ( 91 pack per year ) 6 . Overly malnourished subject , define body mass index 18 kg/m2 . PROSPECTIVE STUDY : Main objective : To study effect three month period calorie restriction normal volunteer expression expression SIRT1 UCP3 muscle , SIRT6 PBMC , brown adipose tissue activity accumulation marker oxidative damage . Specific goal : 1 . To develop prospective model calorie restriction normal human volunteer . 2 . To study change associate calorie restriction : - Serum marker inflammation free fatty acid fast . - The uptake 18fluorodexoyglucose brown adipose tissue measure PET‐CT - The expression mRNA UCP3 SIRT1 muscle biopsy . - The expression mRNA SIRT1 6 muscle peripheral blood mononuclear cell - The accumulation 4 hydroxynonenal 8 hydroxyguanosine muscle , marker oxidative damage - The production ROS peripheral neutrophil overall measure capacity generate free radical - Insulin sensitivity , measure use formula derive glucose tolerance . METHODOLOGY Premenopausal woman , age 25 40 year , BMI 27 32 kg/m2 , interested losing weight , study . Inclusion criterion : complete high school , stable weight ( ± 2 kg ) last six month , absence diabetes , medication intake could influence energy expenditure beta blocker ( except oral contraceptive ) lack engagement competitive exhaust physical activity . Women require use effective contraceptive method , pregnancy test perform every month study last . After sign informed consent form , total energy expenditure measure calorimetry actigraphy doubly label water . Subjects consider energy balance , take account weight stable ( lack weight change assess two week require inclusion study ) . Therefore , assure energy intake moment equal total energy expenditure . Afterwards , subject subject 25 % restriction measure total energy expenditure ( level restriction well tolerated volunteer , even one year ) . Restriction balance , use mediterranean type diet , maintain proportion 50 % carbohydrate , 25-30 % lipid , 25 % protein provision 100 % micronutrient requirement . Patients attend dietician reinforcement every week . To ease restriction period , one extra meal allow week . According weight change , volunteer consider energy restrict ( group 1 ) loose least 3 kg 5 % weight study period . Instead subject reach goal consider control group ( Group 2 ) . The intervention last three month carry period temperature remain relatively stable low , Santiago Chile , avoid effect climate brown adipose tissue activity . The ideal May August . Both group evaluate weekly basis nutritionist ass compliance diet , reinforce indication weigh . Subjects receive monthly monetary remuneration order permit purchase specific food brand prescribe . Each subject educate healthy dietary physical activity lifestyle . Eventual change physical activity ascertain use portable actigraphs ( Actiheart® ) . Apart weight change , volunteer consider calorie restrict triglyceride level decrease least 15 % T3 level reduce least 8 ng/dl . At baseline , end three month intervention period control zero energy balance adherent subject negative energy balance , follow determination carry : 1 . Measurement routine clinical laboratory parameter discard concomitant disease . 2 . Measurement fast serum free fatty acid . 3 . Measurement ultrasensitive C reactive protein carboxymethyllisine ( CML ) inflammation marker glycotoxin respectively , use commercial ELISA kit . 4 . Measurement triglyceride T3 level ass compliance calorie restriction . 5 . Glucose tolerance curve measure glucose insulin calculate insulin sensitivity use Matsuda formula 6 .
