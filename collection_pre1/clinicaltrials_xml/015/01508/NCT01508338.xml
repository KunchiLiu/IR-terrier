	<brief_summary>The purpose study - determine effect 12 week HMB free acid gel , ATP , HMB free acid gel plus ATP supplementation train individual periodized training program skeletal muscle hypertrophy , body composition , strength , force , velocity , peak power load unloaded vertical jump . Additionally , study determine either supplementation protocol prevents typical decay see performance follow overreach cycle perform 9th 10th week study . Finally , study elucidate mechanism action supplementation protein breakdown analyze serum index muscle damage ( CK , LDH ) anabolic status ( Testosterone : Cortisol ratio ) well urinary indicator protein breakdown ( 3-methylhistidine ) . We hypothesize condition supplementation protocols augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy , strength , power HMB blunt increase serum index muscle damage , urinary index protein breakdown .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects HMB , ATP , HMB Plus ATP Muscle Mass , Strength , Power Resistance Trained Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In randomize double blind study subject consume either placebo supplement , HMB supplement , ATP supplement , HMB plus ATP supplement 12 week . While consume supplement subject undergo extensive resistance training program design train major muscle group . An additional overreaching training cycle week 9 10 involve high-volume , hypertrophy style training program . Subject test consist follow : - Strength power week 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 - Range motion muscle soreness week 0 , 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 - Body composition muscle assessment week 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 - Body fat assessment week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 - Blood biochemical measurement week 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 - Urinary analysis protein breakdown ( 3-methylhistidine ) 0 , 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 week</detailed_description>
