	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different physical therapy exercise program person shoulder pain order determine different affect pain level ability use injured shoulder treatment . Both exercise group attend physical therapy hour , two three time week , eight week . The first two week therapy session involve learn exercise test determine weight use exercise . One group perform traditional therapy exercise program shoulder use hand weight . The group perform version shoulder exercise different exercise technique . Exercises program part standard care shoulder impingement physical therapy one program concentrate lower portion exercise ( eccentric ) emphasize lift portion exercise ( concentrics ) . Both group perform warm-up , stretch , cool-down exercise . Participants also require perform daily home exercise program stretch range motion take 20 minute complete . Exercise test determine hand weight resistance use person therapy session re-testing occur every two week determine change weight use exercise keep challenge . Pain level , ability use injured arm daily activity , strength , amount movement shoulder , measure start physical therapy five eight week ( end study ) exercise treatment . A concurrent study investigate reliability shoulder motion strength measurement use large study also perform . Research hypotheses : 1 . Adults shoulder pain complete eccentric progressive resistive exercise intervention demonstrate significantly great improvement outcome measure three week , early intervention , concentric progressive resistive exercise intervention group . 2 . Adults shoulder pain perform progressive resistive exercise intervention , regardless contraction type , demonstrate significant improvement shoulder outcome measure three six week intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Exercise Interventions Adults With Subacromial Impingement Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , repeated-measure , randomized clinical trial compare shoulder outcome measure adults SAIS follow eccentric concentric progressive resistance exercise intervention program . Subjects : 36 person SAIS , age 18 old , recruit Texas Health Resources Dallas outpatient rehabilitation department refer physician . Procedures : Participants randomly assign either concentric eccentric intervention group . Participants complete outcome measure pain intensity , shoulder function , shoulder pain-free active range motion ( AROM ) flexion scapular plane elevation , shoulder pain-free strength external rotation abduction . Outcomes assessed investigator blind group assignment baseline three six week intervention . Interventions consist supervised exercise session three time week . Exercise progression follow standardize systematic approach . The reliability AROM strength outcome measure assess concurrently use random subset six participant group .</detailed_description>
