	<detailed_description>Allopurinol standard care treatment gout . In practice , approximately 20 % patient report side effect allopurinol 5 % discontinue allopurinol due side effect . Allopurinol cause gastrointestinal intolerance , nausea diarrhea , appear dosedependent . Rash develop 2 % patient treated allopurinol , 20 % patient treat allopurinol ampicillin amoxicillin .

Mortality estimate nearly one quarter AHS case , multiorgan system disease include hepatocellular change renal failure serious concern . Allopurinol also relatively contraindicate use combination 6-mercaptopurine azathioprine , 1/4 1/3 low dos must give order avoid hematologic toxicity . Febuxostat , clinical trial , show similar AE profile allopurinol . Liver function abnormality , nausea , arthralgia rash commonly report AEs . In postmarketing experience , Stevens Johnson Syndrome hypersensitivity rash report ( febuxostat prescribe information ) . Withdrawals due AEs similar frequency allopurinol well . Relative contraindication combination 6-mercaptopurine azathioprine similar allopurinol well .
