	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : The purpose investigation determine relationship exist administration dietary supplement contain 5-ALA sleep mood . HYPOTHESIS : There several possible mechanism improvement sleep mood . In one study involve test mouse , researcher find regular administration 5-ALA appear raise serotonin level brain . One hypothesis increase serotonin level , 5-ALA may contribute improvement sleep , along additional improvement mood , calmness , irritability cop ability . 5-ALA may also support hormonal regulation , include melatonin , pineal gland corticosteroid regulation adrenal gland . Another hypothesis 5-ALA may impact increase energy metabolism cell , circadian rhythm well define . 5-ALA may support neuronal function assistance `` mental energy '' need deal stress daily life , produce good feeling `` cop '' , `` less irritability '' lower individual 's feeling `` fatigue '' , may contribute reduction `` pessimism '' regard ability deal daily task . DESIGN : This double-blinded , randomized parallel-group comparison study . SAMPLE : 40 participant randomize follow 2 study group outcome variable ( Sleep Mood ) : Control Group - 20 participant Intervention Group - 20 participant . A table random number use assign participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>5-Aminolevulinic Acid ( 5-ALA ) dietary supplement naturally occur amino acid . It natural delta amino acid ; non-alpha amino acid , component protein . 5-ALA synthesized mitochondrion , first compound prophyrin synthesis pathway , pathway lead heme mammal chlorophyll plant . 5-ALA associated genetic information , structure metabolism , energy conversion . 5-ALA find many common food , spinach , tomato , shitake mushroom , potato , squid , ground beef , wine soy sauce . The normal intake food contain 5-ALA 1-2 mg/day . 5-ALA synthesized body rate 600 mg/day . Data support hypothesis supplementation 5-ALA may relate improved sleep , mood cop ability . This research study explore potential relationship . The duration study participant total 10 week , include 4 separate appointment , space 3-4 week apart . Participants Intervention Group begin take one daily 50 mg capsule p.o . 5-ALA 6 week period , Control Group provide placebo similar size color . Before enter research study , participant undergoes thorough screen process , include lab work ( CBC Ferritin ) . Once accept study , daily capsule start diary fill participant home day bring appointment review . Instructions give record pattern change pertain sleep , mood cop ability . After 6 week , participant instruct stop daily capsule continue daily diary recording . They also schedule one final appointment week 10 . At 4 appointment 10 week period , assessment perform health care professional , questionnaire daily diary reviewed/recorded anthropometric measurement obtain . The product use investigation contain 3 component : - 5-Aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA ) phosphate - Sodium Ferrous Citrate ( SFC ) - Corn starch filler . The 5-ALA capsule content Non-GMO , BSE free , alcohol free . The product test manufacture food GMP condition . A certificate analysis available . Variables monitor part evaluation assess compare intervention group control group . Two-sample t-tests use assess statistical significance baseline follow-up exam . Baseline data summarize mean standard deviation difference among randomized group test significance t-tests chi-square test . To measure possible difference rate change sleep mood score across follow-up time 5-ALA treatment control group , additional analysis estimate difference slop use linear regression model . Mixed linear model fit use proc mixed procedure SAS 9.2 . The regression model include indicator variable identify treatment group , variable week follow-up , interaction term indicator variable follow-up time . Results summarize difference slope compare intervention group control group . Results also present graphically illustrate estimate difference slope study group . All significant test two-sided .</detailed_description>
