	<detailed_description>Identification validation early chronic disease biomarkers child paramount importance especially burgeon arena pediatric obesity research . Despite presence risk factor , obese child develop overt CVD early life . However , pathologic process CVD begin first two decade life , particularly presence obesity . Because CVD cumulative process occur time , identify early sign order intervene sooner may large impact slow progression . The challenge identify obese youth early vascular problem . Looking vascular endothelium biomarkers damage reasonable approach prominent role origins atherosclerosis . Endothelial activation one early detectable sign beginning CVD predict subsequent atherosclerosis future cardiovascular event . However , accurately quantify endothelial health child proven major challenge . Brachial artery FMD commonly-used method quantify endothelial health child . However , technique widely applicable , even research setting , require specialized equipment highly-trained technician . Moreover , result highly variable ( especially across site ) due operator dependence intra-individual fluctuation endothelial function . More direct measure endothelial cell biology , CEC EMP , may offer great precision characterize state endothelium may especially useful risk-prediction biomarkers youth since hallmark advance endothelial cell distress , thereby identify highest-risk individual . CEC EMP extensively study adult associate vascular disease , CVD risk factor , CVD event . Despite well-validated adult , CEC EMP formally evaluate disease biomarkers child adolescent . Pediatric obesity ideal condition validate CEC EMP disease biomarkers since adiposity childhood associate CVD , type 2 diabetes mellitus , premature death later life . In particular , extreme obesity especially high-risk condition associate significant co-morbidities . Our primary focus study evaluation CEC EMP biomarkers CVD risk , goal validate CEC EMP use vascular endpoint pediatric research study . We propose evaluate change level CEC EMP response substantial weight loss adolescent extreme obesity undergo elective , clinically-indicated bariatric surgery . Specific Aims : 1 . Evaluate effect substantial weight loss level CEC EMP adolescent extreme obesity . We hypothesize level CEC EMP significantly reduce follow elective , clinically-indicated bariatric surgery adolescent extreme obesity . The magnitude change CEC EMP level correlate magnitude weight loss improvement CVD risk factor endothelial function follow bariatric surgery . We enroll 32 child adolescent ( age 8-17 ) schedule elective bariatric surgery . They evaluate prior surgery , six month surgery twelve month surgery .</detailed_description>
