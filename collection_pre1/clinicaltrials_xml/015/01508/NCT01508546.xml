	<brief_title>Conservative Surgery With Without Axillary Lymphnode Removal Treating Women With T1N0 Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : To compare efficacy conservative surgery , without axillary lymphnode removal ( quadrantectomy axillary dissection ( QUAD ) vs. quadrantectomy alone ( QU ) ) follow adjuvant treatment . To plan adjuvant therapy vs. adjuvant therapy ( eA+CMF+TAM regimen ) base biological panel primary tumor QU group ( define good panel ( GP ) ( ER+ , one unfavourable feature ( G3 , Her2+++ , Laminin Receptor+ ) bad panel ( BP ) ( ER- , ER+ one unfavourable feature ) , whereas QUAD group base good factor ( N- , ER+ GI-II disease ( GF ) ) bad factor ( N+ GIII ER- disease ( BF ) ) . To determine relationship biological variable ( hormone receptor status , grade , Laminin receptor , c-erbB2 ) clinical outcome disease patient . OUTLINE This randomize unicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm 1 : patient undergo conservative surgery axillary lymphnodes removal Arm 2 : patient undergo conservative surgery without axillary lymphnodes removal Post-operative adjuvant strategy previously describe . Patients follow every 4 month first two year , every 6 month follow two year , annually thereafter .
