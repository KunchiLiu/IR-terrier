	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients include study follow criterion meet : The patient man woman , 18 65 year age , diagnosis asthma . The patient ACQ score least 1.5 . At screen , patient airway reversibility least 12 % betaagonist administration . The patient currently take fluticasone dosage least 440 µg daily ( equivalent ) . Patients ' baseline asthma therapy regimen ( include limit inhaled corticosteroid , leukotriene antagonist , 5lipoxygenase inhibitor , cromolyn ) must stable 30 day screen continue without dosage change throughout study . Female patient must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , must negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( ßHCG ) result pregnancy test screening ( serum ) baseline ( urine ) . Female patient childbearing potential ( surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal ) , must use medically accept method contraception must agree continue use method duration study 30 day participation study . Acceptable method contraception include barrier method spermicide , abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , steroidal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) . Written inform consent obtain . The patient reasonable health ( except diagnosis asthma ) judge investigator , determine medical history , medical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) evaluation , serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , serology . The patient must willing able comply study restriction remain clinic require duration study period , willing return clinic followup evaluation specify protocol . Patients exclude participate study 1 follow criterion meet : The patient another confound underlying lung disorder ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer ) . The patient pulmonary condition symptoms asthma blood eosinophilia ( eg , ChurgStrauss syndrome , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ) . The patient clinically meaningful comorbidity would interfere study schedule procedure , compromise patient 's safety . The patient know hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . The patient current smoker ( ie , smoke within last 6 month prior screen ) . The patient history use systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulating agent ( antiimmunoglobulin E [ antiIgE ] mAb , methotrexate , cyclosporin , interferonα , antitumor necrosis factor mAb , omalizumab ) within 6 month prior study entry ( randomization ) . The patient currently use use systemic corticosteroid ( include use oral corticosteroid ) within 30 day prior screen visit . The patient expect poorly compliant study drug administration , study procedure , visit . The patient aggravating factor inadequately control , thus would aggravate asthma symptom ( eg , gastroesophageal reflux disease ) . The patient participate investigative drug device study within 30 day prior screen . The patient participate investigative biologics study within 90 day prior screen . The patient previously receive reslizumab antihIL5 mAbs ( eg , mepolizumab ) . The patient pregnant lactate woman . ( Any woman become pregnant study withdrawn study . ) The patient current infection disease may preclude assessment asthma . The patient history concurrent immunodeficiency ( human immunodeficiency , acquire immunodeficiency syndrome , congenital immunodeficiency ) . The patient suspect current drug alcohol abuse specify Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , Text Revision ( DSMIVTR ) criterion . The patient presence suspect parasitic infestation/infection . Patients may receive live attenuate vaccine within 12week period study entry .</criteria>
