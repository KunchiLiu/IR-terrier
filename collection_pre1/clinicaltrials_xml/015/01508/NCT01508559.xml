	<brief_summary>The treatment HIV test perform HIV care change last 20 year improvement management HIV-infected subject still warrant . The investigator would like collect analyse clinical information obtain subject 18 50 year age . The investigator look routine clinic information blood pressure , recent blood test result clinical history . The investigator assess cognitive ( brain ) function talk and/or write test . These test include test memory , depression anxiety . All identify problem brain function way offer onward referral assessment appropriate . Those take part offer follow visit 24-48 week first assessment see change . This allow u understand brain problem develop , get bad , get good time . No genetic research do . Depression mental health condition characterize negative feeling , generally low mood , problem eat sleep normally . Anxiety also mental health condition person feel general anxiousness fear specific situation , , serious case , panic attack . Impaired brain function condition nervous system brain brain function well normally , include symptom forgetfulness , everyday task slowly become disorientated time day place one . For study , investigator also collect data medical record , include ( know ) social educational-related data , HIV infection-related data ( e.g . date diagnosis , blood test result ) , relevant medical history ( e.g . previous psychiatric condition ) medication use ( e.g . date start , drug use ) . The information investigator get study use inform healthcare provider ( doctor , nurse , health advisor , psychologist ) whether necessary routinely assess HIV infect patient presence anxiety/depression impair brain function . The investigator also get information whether treatment use HIV infection make difference commonly condition occur patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim project examine neurocognitive functioning HIV infect men sex men ( MSMs ) . We limit study group order well study share risk factor ( hepatitis coinfection , recreational drug use ) . Given ongoing work old cohort aim study neurocognitive impairment young subject ( 18-49 year ) . There two part study . The first cross sectional pilot ( MSM Neurocog-1 ) look neurocognitive function HIV infect HIV uninfected MSMs . The second plan prospective 48 week cohort study 24-48 week study ( MSM Neurocog-2 ) follow neurocognitive function HIV infect subject group HIV uninfected control time . The shift HIV care chronic , manageable condition transfer focus long-term morbidity drug toxicity . One area renew interest prevalence relevance neurocognitive impairment , well significance compartmentalise virus CSF compare blood . Controlled , comparative data lack - many cross-sectional study date control important confounders recreational inject drug use , current prior co-infections co-morbidities . Where happen , researcher generally use general population control may differ markedly HIV-infected individual term lifestyle demographic factor . In addition paucity longitudinal data mean unclear whether individual normal neurocognitive function pre-ART develop impairment later subject evidence impairment expect improvement normalisation time ; issue highly important clinical management patient counsel . There consensus surrogate marker , , important term diagnose , monitor and/or predict neurocognitive impairment . Studies measure correlation neurocognitive performance neuronal marker inflammation conflicting .</detailed_description>
