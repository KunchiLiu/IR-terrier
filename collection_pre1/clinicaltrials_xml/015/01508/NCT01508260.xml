	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety level effectiveness aquapheresis compare diuretic drug . Diuretic drug design help kidneys form urine . They also remove fluid patient severe fluid overload respond diuretic . Aquapheresis procedure remove excess fluid body . Blood contain much salt water withdrawn body use catheter ( sterile flexible tube ) pass special filter . The filter separate excess salt water blood . The blood return patient fluid collect bag dispose . Aquapherisis may benefit patient remove excess fluid salt body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrafiltration ( Aquapheresis ) Patients With Leukemia Severe Fluid Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . The first group 10 participant join study enrol Pilot portion study . The next group 40 participant enrol Randomized portion study . In Pilot portion study , researcher want learn safety level effectiveness aquapheresis leukemia patient severe fluid overload respond diuretic . If Randomized portion study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign group . - Group A receive aquapheresis . - Group B receive furosemide . The doctor discus . If Group A , connect aquapheresis pump intravenous ( IV ) catheter place forearm . The pump look like one use infuse IV drug . It hang pole bed . About 6 teaspoon blood flow blood circuit , excess fluid slowly collect collection bag . The exact length time aquapheresis treatment determine much fluid need remove fast remove . The average treatment 24 hour extend 7 day . About 6 liter 13 pound remove . If Group B , receive one follow doctor think need ( excess fluid remove ) : - furosemide vein 15 minute every 8 hour - furosemide vein continuous ( non-stop ) infusion Both Groups : If doctor think need , give standard care drug albumin metolazone help kidney make urine . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Study Visits : Every day receive aquapheresis diuretic treatment : - You ask symptom may . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate ) weight . - You ask much drank . The study staff measure much urinate . - Your leg measure swell due fluid retention . At least every day , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , chest x-ray Day 3 . Length Participation : If Group A , remain study treatment long doctor think need ( possibly 1-7 day ) . If Group B , receive standard treatment long doctor think need . You longer able receive study treatment ( Group A ) take study ( Group B ) intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop taking study treatment standard treatment , follow test procedure perform : - You ask symptom may . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask much drank . The study staff measure much urinate . - Your leg measure swell due fluid retention . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , chest x-ray . End-of-Study Follow-up Visit : At 30 day end study therapy : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask symptom may . - Your leg measure swell due fluid retention . This investigational study . The Aquadex FlexFlow™ Fluid Removal Systems pump use aquapheresis FDA approve commercially available patient fluid overload . Using Aquadex FlexFlow™ Fluid Removal Systems pump patient leukemia remove excess fluid investigational . Furosemide FDA approve commercially available us treatment swell cause heart failure kidney liver problem . Up 50 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
