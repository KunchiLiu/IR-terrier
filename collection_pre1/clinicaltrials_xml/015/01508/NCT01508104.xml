	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial determine effect good bad combine BEZ235 along Everolimus determine safe treatment patient advance cancer different type .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study BEZ235 With Everolimus Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BEZ235 agent develop slow halt cell growth proliferation . It work inhibit two pathway important cell growth replication , one call mTOR call PI3K . Everolimus agent also target mTOR thus also slow cell growth spread ; addition , injure blood vessel supply cancer cell nutrition . The rationale behind combine Everolimus BEZ235 inhibit cell growth halt cancer spread great degree either drug alone . BEZ235 approve FDA use human outside context clinical trial . Everolimus FDA approve treatment renal cell carcinoma ( kidney cancer ) , subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) associate tuberous sclerosis ( TS ) , Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Pancreatic Origin ( PNET ) .</detailed_description>
