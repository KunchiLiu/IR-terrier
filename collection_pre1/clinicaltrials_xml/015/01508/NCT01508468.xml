	<brief_summary>The Membranous Nephropathy one common cause Nephrotic Syndrome adult . In 2/3 patient cause disease idiopathic . This also referred idiopathic membranous nephropathy ( IMN ) .The patient treat non immunosuppressive symptomatic treatment ( NIST ) : antiproteinuric antihypertensive block rennin-angiotensine system . However , patient resistant antiproteinuric treatment risk develop end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Rituximab recently use patient suffer nephrotic syndrome relate IMN four international study . Rituximab appear effective safe reduce proteinuria nearly 60 % patient . The primary outcome investigator prospective randomize study determine whether Rituximab associate NIST effective non immunologic symptomatic treatment alone induce long term remission proteinuria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Rituximab Treatment Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IMN expose patient severe complication engage vital prognosis Nephrotic Syndrome . The development well tolerate effective pathogenesis link therapy need treat patient idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy Rituximab , monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) CD20 present B cell , recently use patient suffer nephrotic syndrome relate IMN four international study . Rituximab appear effective safe reduce proteinuria nearly 60 % patient . However , randomize control study publish date . In previous study , outcome 28 patient treat rituximab idiopathic MN analyse . Anti-PLA2R antibody serum PLA2R antigen kidney biopsy assess 10 9 patient . Proteinuria significantly decrease 56 % , 62 % 87 % 3 month , 6 month 12 month . At 6 month , 2 patient achieve full remission 12 partial remission ( overall renal response , 50 % ) . At 12 month ( n=23 ) , complete remission achieve 6 patient partial remission 13 patient ( overall renal response , 82,6 % ) . Three patient suffer relapse nephrotic proteinuria 27 50 month treatment . Univariate analysis suggest degree renal failure ( MDRD &lt; 45/ml/min/1.73 m² ) independent factor predict lack response rituximab . Anti-PLA2R antibody detect serum 10 patient , PLA2R antigen immune deposit 8 9 patient . Antibodies become negative 5 responsive patient available follow-up . In retrospective study , high rate remission achieve 12 month treatment . Our trial Prospective randomize multicentric open label study . The 2 arm study : Non Immunosuppressive Symptomatic Treatment ( NIST ) Rituximab+ NIST Patients randomize Rituximab arm receive 375 mg/m² day 1 8 ( + NIST ) . Patients control arm treat Non Immunosuppressive Symptomatic Treatment ( NIST ) . The duration participation per patient 6 month interventional study . An observational follow-up perform M9 , M12 , M18 &amp; M24 patient include study lab data collection test do usual pathology follow-up . A part diagnosis renal biopsy ( perform usually part health care ) collect patient purpose central analysis . Our Primary Outcome Measure evaluation efficacy Rituximab associate NIST ( IMN ) reduce rate proteinuria ( patient persistent urinary protein excretion rate ≥3,5g/24 h albuminemia &lt; 30g/l ) .</detailed_description>
