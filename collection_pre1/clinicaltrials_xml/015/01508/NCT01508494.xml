	<brief_summary>The investigator would like conduct double blind placebo-controlled prospective study show impact treatment combine specific cognitive rehabilitation program acetylcholinesterase inhibitor executive function young patient 3 month first symptomatic stroke . The secondary objective assess cognitive change performance ( executive also non trained function memory ) treatments treatment effect activity daily live quality life . The main objective study show impact combine treatment brain activation map VCI-ND patient post-acute phase ( 3 month ) stroke . Treatment effect assess functional MRI ( fMRI ) patient perform specific executive task . The investigator hypothesize specific rehabilitation associate acetylcholinestrase inhibitor treatment focalize cerebral activation observe fMRI , improve executive function specifically , improve non trained cognitive function ( generalization effect ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study , include investigator ' , show neuropsychological alteration frequent underestimated stroke ( Vascular Cognitive Impairment ( VCI ) . VCI-No Dementia ( VCI-ND ) characterize mild cognitive alteration relation cerebrovascular lesion , diagnose neuropsychological assessment , without major alteration activity daily live , represent issue return work young patient . Some study demonstrate cognitive rehabilitation pharmacological intervention may improve patient ' cognition social functioning . The investigator hypothesize combination pharmacological cognitive rehabilitation treatment beneficial executive also cognitive function VCI-ND patient Therefore investigator would like conduct double blind placebo-controlled prospective study show impact treatment combine specific cognitive rehabilitation program acetylcholinesterase inhibitor executive function young patient 3 month first symptomatic stroke . The secondary objective assess cognitive change performance ( executive also non trained function memory ) treatments treatment effect activity daily live quality life . The main objective study show impact combine treatment brain activation map VCI-ND patient post-acute phase ( 3 month ) stroke . Treatment effect assess functional MRI ( fMRI ) patient perform specific executive task . The investigator hypothesize specific rehabilitation associate acetylcholinestrase inhibitor treatment focalize cerebral activation observe fMRI , improve executive function specifically , improve non trained cognitive function ( generalization effect ) .</detailed_description>
