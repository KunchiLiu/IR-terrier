	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine uptake , ( semi- ) quantification localization VEGF target fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IDRye800CW breast cancer tissue , surround healthy tissue , tumor margin lymph node . This measured surgical specimen single intravenous administration 4,5 bevacizumab-IDRye800CW , use fluorescence microscopy macroscopy technique . Also safety bevacizumab-IDRye800CW assess . Another purpose ass ability three different fluorescent signal detection system detect fluorescent signal pre- intra-operatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEGF-targeted Fluorescent Tracer Imaging Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need good visualization presence extent breast cancer improve breast cancer management . Molecular image breast cancer associate target promise method improve visualization . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) proven valid target molecular image radioactive label tracer . However view radiation safety , infrastructure , cost stability , fluorescent label bevacizumab ( VEGF target humanize monoclonal antibody ) potential advantage radioactive label . Therefore recently near-infrared fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW developed . In mice fluorescent signal clearly present tumor tissue could visualize intra-operatively . The tracer also approve administration patient microdose ( tracer dose ) . In prospective multicenter feasibility study new tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW administer maximum 30 patient proven breast cancer 3 day surgery . Part surgical specimen surgery extensively investigate macroscopy microscopy determine uptake tracer tumor tissue , surround normal tissue lymph node . To detect tracer surgery , two different pre-operative imaging method use : MSOT ( UMCG en FDOT UMCU . During surgery intra-operative MFRI camera available center detect fluorescent signal . The study consist total five study procedure relate patient visit . 1 . During screen visit , eligibility evaluate patient characteristic collect . 2 . During administration visit , 3 day surgery , 4.5 mg bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW administer intravenously , follow 4 hour observation . Also 4 hour tracer injection pre-operative optical image take place ( UMC Groningen , hand-held MSOT system use UMC Utrecht , FDOT system use ) blood sample take . 3 . A third visit , approximately 36 hour tracer administration , another pre-operative optical imaging procedure take place . 4 . At day surgery , first blood sample take last pre-operative optical imaging procedure take place , follow standard surgery . During surgery , MFRI camera use detect fluorescent signal incision removal tumor . Part surgical specimen surgery extensively investigate macroscopy microscopy determine uptake tracer tumor tissue , surround normal tissue lymph node . 5 . At outpatient visit ( approximately 10 day surgery ) ( visit 5 ) , last blood sample take .</detailed_description>
