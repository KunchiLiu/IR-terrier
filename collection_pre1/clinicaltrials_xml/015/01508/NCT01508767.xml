	<brief_summary>Patients undergo colon rectal surgery usually urinary catheter ( silicone tube ) place bladder time operate monitor kidney function surgery post-surgery period . Such patient also infusion spine , know epidural , surgery provide continuous pain relief . Urinary catheter remove early possible longer require facilitate patient become mobile surgery reduce risk patient develop urinary tract infection . Traditionally catheter remove patient epidural infusion withdrawn , theory would predispose patient develop acute retention urine due lack sensation bladder full . The investigator hypothesis urinary catheter place via urethra withdrawn 48 hour colon/rectal surgery patient receive epidural pain relief without significant increase rate urinary retention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Post-operative Removal Urethral Catheter Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery With Epidural Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo colon rectal surgery randomly assign one two group : Patients study group 1 ( SG1 ) urinary catheter remove 48 hour post-operatively ; Patients study group 2 ( SG2 ) urinary catheter remove epidural withdrawn post-operative period . We primarily examine rate urinary retention group . We also examine rate urinary tract infection , chest infection ( frequently result poor mobility surgery ) , wound infection complication surgery .</detailed_description>
