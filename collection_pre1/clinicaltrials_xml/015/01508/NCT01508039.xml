	<brief_title>Immunological Effects From Intranasal Chitin Micro-Particles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY SYNOPSIS Objectives Primary •To ass effect intranasal dose chitin micro-particles nasal mucosa response respect concentration cytokine ( TNF-alfa , IFN-gamma , IL-1b , IL-4 IL5 , IL , 6 , IL-8 , IL-10 IL-13 ) nasal lavage fluid compare dose placebo . Secondary - To assess effect intranasal dose chitin micro-particles nasal mucosa response respect concentration cytokine ( TNF-alfa , IFN-gamma , IL-1b , IL-4 IL5 , IL , 6 , IL-8 , IL-10 IL-13 ) nasal lavage fluid compare dose active control . - To assess total eosinophil count cysteinyl leukotriene concentration nasal lavage fluid 4 8 hour post-dosing compare pre-dosing . - To assess total nasal symptom score 4 8 hour post-dosing . - To assess safety tolerability chitin micro-particles dose intranasally . Study design This study single-dose , doubled-blind placebo single-blind active control 3-period cross-over study 2-week washout treatment . The subject divide 2-groups study randomise receive single-dose either intranasal chitin micro-particles placebo first two period single dose active control article , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , third period . The treatment first two period double-blinded treatment third period LPS single-blinded . Each single dose application chitin micro-particles ( cmp ) , placebo active control article , LPS , comprise two 0.1 ml meter spray nostril . The total spray volume application 0.4 ml equivalent total single-dose chitin 2 mg ( 0.5 mg per 0.1 ml spray ) , total single-dose LPS , 2 mg endotoxin Enterobacter agglomerans ( 0.5 mg per 0.1 ml spray ) . The climate chamber dose perform run 22°C 3.5-4 air change per hour clean HEPA-filtered air relative humidity ( RH ) 35-40 % Study population The study involve 12-healthy subject conform inclusion criterion randomise treatment . The duration subject 's participation c.42-days eight visit include screen safety follow-up . Treatment plan methods The study comprise three cross-over treatment period , subject ( 12 total ) receive single-doses cmp , placebo LPS ( active control ) three treatment period . The study design LPS dose last period mitigate potential issue carry-over . Screening take place period c.2-6-weeks prior dosing . After obtain informed consent , subject undergo screen visit order review inclusion/exclusion criterion confirm eligibility . Each subject assign one two dose group ( 6 subject per group ) three study period order co-ordinate dose Clinic . The initial screening identify 4-8 additional subject ( total 20 screen ) include one originally randomize subject drop study . Subjects replace randomized treatment require undergo three treatment period . For period 1 , day 0 , first dose group randomize receive either cmp placebo . Subjects admit Clinic 8:30h acclimatize , receive pre-dosing clinical assessment confirm eligibility . Dosing start 10:00h assessment conduct accordance procedure define . Subjects remain Clinic c. 20:00h . On follow day ( day 1 ) , subject receive telephone interview safety follow-up . On day 2 , second dose group randomize receive either cmp placebo , receive telephone interview safety follow-up following day ( day 3 ) . For period 2 , day 14 , first dose group receive dose previously assign , either cmp placebo receive telephone interview safety follow-up following day ( day 15 ) . On day 16 , second dose group also receive dose previously assign , either cmp placebo receive telephone interview safety follow-up following day ( day 17 ) . For period 3 , LPS dose first dose group day 28 second dose group day 30 ; telephone interview safety follow-up day 29 31 respectively . Following last dosing visit , subject receive end-of-study safety assessment telephone interview day 42 ( +/- 2 day ) , include adverse event check . Each subject require provide 10 ml blood haematological assessment screen treatment period 1 , 2 3 . A total 40 ml blood drawn subject entire duration study . Pre-dosing 1 . Safety assessment term physical examination , include mouth , nose lung 2 . Symptom questionnaire 3 . Blood drawn haematological test 4 . Nasal lavage nasal olive test person sit head bent forward 60 second perform Post-dosing 5 . Measurement nasal symptom score 4 8-hours 6 . Acoustic rhinometry test perform 4 8-hours 7 . Nasal lavage nasal olive test person sit head bent forward 60 second perform 4 8-hours 8 . Symptom questionnaire perform 4 8-hours 9 . Safety monitoring : vital sign , heart rate , blood pressure perform 2 , 6-hours 10 . Follow-up safety interview perform 24-hours dosing ( follow day ) include adverse event record concomitant medication check . Primary End-point Changes level ( maximum concentration ) TNF-alfa , IFN-gamma , IL-1b , IL-4 , IL5 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 IL-13 nasal lavage sample follow intranasal dose cmp compare placebo . Secondary End-point Changes level ( maximum concentration ) TNF-alfa , IFN-gamma , IL-1b , IL-4 , IL5 , IL-6 , IL-8 IL-10 IL-13 nasal lavage sample follow intranasal dose cmp compare lipopolysaccharide active control . Change baseline : 1. total eosinophil count cysteinyl leukotriene concentration nasal lavage fluid follow intranasal dose cmp 2. total nasal symptom score 4 8-hours follow intranasal dose cmp Safety assess use adverse event , vital sign nasal acoustic rhinometry follow dose cmp versus placebo . Statistical Assessment For cytokine cell count concentration measure , log-transformed data analyze ANOVA model include study day exposure fix factor participant random factor . These variable describe geometric mean , coefficient variance ( CV ) , relative difference exposure include 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , p-value . Because ceiling flooring problem data , heterogeneity ( within participant ) variation , violation assumption normally distribute data , appropriate analyze data outcome like symptom score ( change baseline ) ANOVAs . Here non-parametric test apply . A Wilcoxon Rank sum test use compare group . Subjective symptom baseline describe median inter quartile range . The data 'change nasal score ' describe box-plots . The upper adjacent value plots large data-point small 75th percentile plus 3/2 time inter quartile range . The low adjacent value define similar way . To compare placebo cmp exposure take account possible 'learning effect ' data analyse standard technique take account design ( cross-over ) . The participant divide two group due two possible exposure order ; one group consist participant expose placebo exposure cmp exposure ; another group participant expose cmp placebo exposure . The hypothesis difference cmp placebo exposure test compare two group respect difference first second measurement . A Wilcoxon Rank sum test use compare two group . In similar way test hypothesis 'no effect learn ' .</detailed_description>
