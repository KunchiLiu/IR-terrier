	<brief_summary>The Vitamin D receptor find colon cancer cell . When Vitamin D bind receptor cancer cell , may stop cancer cell grow abnormally may cause cell death . Vitamin D use research study information research study suggest Vitamin D may help treatment colorectal cancer . In research study , investigator compare standard high dose Vitamin D treatment give combination standard treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Standard treatment include chemotherapy combination 5-FU , Leucovorin Oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vitamin D Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize one study groups-Arm A : Vitamin D ( standard dose 400 IU/day ) , FOLFOX Bevacizumab Arm B : Vitamin D ( high dose 8000 IU/day 2 week follow 4000 IU/day ) , FOLFOX Bevacizumab . Study Treatment ( A cycle treatment 14 day ) : Vitamin D Cycle 1 : You take two capsule Vitamin D orally , day ( time ) , every day . Participants randomize Arm A take one capsule 400 IU Vitamin D one capsule placebo ( pill medicine ) neither doctor know group assign . Participants randomize Arm B take two capsule 4000 IU . Subsequent Cycles : You take one capsule orally , day ( time ) , every day . Participants randomize Arm A take one capsule 400 IU Vitamin D. Participants randomize Arm B take one capsule 4000 IU Vitamin D. FOLFOX bevacizumab FOLFOX bevacizumab give intravenously ( IV , vein arm ) Day 1 every cycle participant Arms A B . The infusion take several hour , addition doctor 's visit , plan clinic day . Note 5-FU give bolus day 1 ( give one dose ) , give continuous IV infusion 2 day . You need port-a-cath place . A port-a-cath medical device place skin . The continuous infusion deliver pump insert port-a-cath . The pump carry pouch hook around waist . Arrangements make pump disconnect 2 day . You may need return clinic disconnect . While study , follow test procedure perform : Cycle 1 , Day 1 - Questions health , current medication allergy . - Physical exam , include vital sign - Performance status - Routine blood test evaluate health - Urine test Subsequent Cycles , Day 1 - Questions health , current medication , allergy side effect may . - Physical exam , include vital sign - Performance status - Routine blood test evaluate health - Urine test - Review study drug diary ( please bring every visit ) . Every 4 cycle ( approximately every 8 week ) : An assessment tumor CT scan MRI . Additional blood sample research : Samples draw ( little 1 teaspoon blood ) Cycle 4 , Cycle 8 every 8 Cycles thereafter . You continue receive treatment long disease get bad tolerating treatment . End treatment - Questions health , current medication allergy . - Physical exam , include vital sign - Performance status - Blood test ( routine blood test evaluate health blood sample research ) - Urine test - An assessment tumor CT scan MRI After final dose study drug : You follow safety reason 30 day last dose study drug . If experiencing side effect , may continue follow side effect resolve start another treatment . If discontinue study treatment reason disease progression ( example , side effect ) , ask continue get tumor assessment every 8 - 16 week disease worsens demonstrate tumor assessment start another therapy treat cancer . These assessment may coincide routine follow-up , case would need repeat . We would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like review medical record and/or call telephone every 3 month see . Keeping touch check condition help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
