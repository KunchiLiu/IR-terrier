	<brief_summary>Fatigue one frequent symptom report multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient often significant source disability . Unlike normal fatigue , multiple sclerosis relate fatigue ( MSRF ) occur independently activity level , suggest due dysfunction neural pathway regulate perception energy although precise cause still understood . While MSRF manage lifestyle modification drug treatment , measure commonly either ineffective partially effective . Administration male sex hormone testosterone show improve energy level males testosterone-deficiency state . Testosterone also reduce fatigue patient medical condition associate low testosterone level , suggest treatment may also useful symptomatic control MSRF . This propose seven-month long clinical trial design test hypothesis administration oral testosterone tablet male MS patient result improvement fatigue relative administration placebo tablet . As fatigue frequently report MS patient one frustrate disable symptom , proven additional treatment option MSRF would beneficial improve quality life .</brief_summary>
