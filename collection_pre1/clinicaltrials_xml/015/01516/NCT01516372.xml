	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo- control cross-over study investigate effect GEn cardiac repolarisation parameter compare placebo positive control , moxifloxacin . Approximately 52 subject recruit study take part four dosing session . Subjects receive , randomized order , single dose 1200 mg GEn , 6000 mg GEn ( supratherapeutic dose ) , 400 mg moxifloxacin ( positive control ) placebo . Twelve lead continuous ECG monitoring conduct pre-dose approximately 24 hour dose Day 1 study session . The primary comparison interest mean change baseline time-matched difference QTcF GEn treatment placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 4-period , randomize , active-and placebo-controlled , double-dummy , double-blind cross-over study evaluate effect single dos GEn cardiac conduction parameter healthy subject . Screening occur within approximately 28 day first schedule dose study medication . Each subject participate 4 dose session least one week apart . Prior dose period , investigator review schedule assessment confirm subject 's suitability study include review study entry criterion lifestyle restriction . All subject receive single dos GEn 1200 mg , GEn 6000 mg , moxifloxacin 400 mg placebo randomize sequence . Dosing moxifloxacin fast state GEn administer follow standard meal . A double dummy approach use maintain blinding . Thus , dose day , moxifloxacin moxifloxacin placebo administer fasted state morning GEn match placebo administer 2 hour later standard meal . During treatment period , subject report clinical research unit day dose ( Day 1 ) remain completion last assessment Day 2 . Twelve-lead ECGs include continuous Holter monitoring , clinical laboratory safety test , vital sign measurement , physical examination , adverse event report , pharmacokinetic sample collect throughout study . In study period , cardiac conduction measure use 24-hour continuous 12-lead Holter monitor morning Day 1 morning Day 2 . Extraction Holter monitor data triplicate analysis begin Day 1 timepoints indicated Time Events Table ( Section 4.7 ) . These timepoints select cover Cmax moxifloxacin GEn . If clinically significant abnormality note , subject discharge clinical research unit completion assessment Day 2 period . A minimum 7-day washout period separate treatment period . A follow-up visit conduct approximately 7 14 day administration last dose study medication treatment period 4</detailed_description>
