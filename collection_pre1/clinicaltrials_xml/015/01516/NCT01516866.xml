	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new imaging technique , call 18F-Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . NaF tracer ( dye ) sensitive change bone . By use tracer positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) imaging , ability evaluate measure change bone lesion could greatly improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) Patients With Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) With Microtubule Directed Chemo AR-directed Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study look repeatable NaF PET scan treatment . Scans also perform standard chemotherapy hormone-directed treatment . This allow evaluation NaF PET scan change chemotherapy hormone-directed therapy . In addition , NaF PET scan compare standard compute tomography ( CT ) bone scan , well prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . This information could use develop good way measure prostate cancer bone lesion . In turn , could use well evaluate treatment effect standard chemotherapy new drug develop treat prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
