	<brief_title>Secondary Prophylaxis Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplant consider standard care patient relapse and/or refractory aggressive lymphoma . High-dose chemotherapy , without ASCT , may also use upfront chemotherapy accord lymphoma histotype ( e.g . primary central nervous system lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma ) , advanced stage disease , extranodal involvement , high IPI . Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression result various degree neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia relate complication lead hospitalization , impaired quality life , death , increase healthcare cost . While myeloid growth factor reduce neutropenia incidence neutropenic fever , erythropoietic agent reduce anemia transfusion , chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) still remain unmet treatment need . Thrombocytopenia significantly associate increased bleeding risk , platelet transfusion need , chemotherapy dose reduction treatment delay , usually compromise therapeutic efficacy . Platelet transfusion also limit cost , supply , associate risk , transfusion reaction , transmission infection , alloimmunization platelet refractoriness . Alternative strategy evaluate pharmacologic option stimulate platelet production overcome CIT . The predominant reason low platelet count cancer patient receive chemotherapy deficiency platelet production . Megakaryopoiesis , process development mega-karyocytes production platelet , involve highly complex cascade event , differentiation immature progenitor maturation megakaryocytes release platelet bone marrow sinusoid . Cytokines present within specialized bone marrow niche contribute survival , proliferation , differentiation megakaryocyte . In addition TPO , essential growth factor platelet production , several growth factor cytokine , IL-1 , IL-3 , IL-6 , IL-11 , SCF , contribute towards megakaryopoiesis different stage development maturation . In last decade , number cytokine evaluate prevention treatment thrombocytopenia . Unfortunately , none yet provide commercially available agent high therapeutic index . Despite promising thrombopoietic activity , clinical development first-generation recombinant TPOs halt due immunogenicity concern . This lead development TPO agonists homology TPO bind TPO receptor activate signal-ling , leading increase platelet production .</detailed_description>
