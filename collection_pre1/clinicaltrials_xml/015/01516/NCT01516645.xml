	<brief_summary>This two-part , Phase 1 open label , single-center , dose escalation study KHK2898 monotherapy subject advance solid tumor longer respond standard therapy standard therapy available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study KHK2898 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part . In Part 1 , standard 3+3 design dose escalation phase , subject receive KHK2898 , administer intravenously , every 2 week . A treatment cycle consist total two dos per cycle . Part 2 study enroll subject squamous cell type tumor receive KHK2898 dose determine follow completion Part 1 . All subject receive study therapy disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , noncompliance withdrawal consent subject , Investigator decision , maximum six cycle ( approximately six month ) . After six cycle KHK2898 therapy , subject may continue receive drug discussion Sponsor determination subject experience best response least stable disease ( SD ) experience unacceptable toxicity dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) .</detailed_description>
