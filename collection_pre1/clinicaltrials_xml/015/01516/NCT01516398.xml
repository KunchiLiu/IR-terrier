	<brief_summary>A lung condition call bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) major cause poor outcome death premature infant . Infants BPD also high risk pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) —an important contributor condition . Previous research suggest protein blood , endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , associate pulmonary disease . This study aim investigate incidence PH level ET-1 among premature baby BPD . It also potentially allow u focus research effort treatment towards infant , sick patient LPCH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim 1 ) investigate incidence PH among premature infant BPD versus without BPD 2 ) investigate ET-1 level infant BPD-associated PH versus without BPD-associated PH . This study allow u help define high-risk population LPCH—namely , premature infant BPD-associated PH . It also potentially allow u focus research effort treatment target towards infant encompass sick patient LPCH . In 2009 Division Lung Diseases National Heart , Lung Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) publish seven priority area research pediatric pulmonary disease , one pulmonary vascular disease . An emphasis make find 'clinical strategy anticipate development PH [ ] may allow early recognition aggressive therapy , thereby slow development PH many chronic lung parenchymal vascular disease ' . This study attempt address goal . Specifically aim evaluate ET-1 level premature infant diagnose BPD BPD-associated PH . If ET-1 level find correlate disease state possibility prediction possible early treatment PH infant raise merit investigation .</detailed_description>
