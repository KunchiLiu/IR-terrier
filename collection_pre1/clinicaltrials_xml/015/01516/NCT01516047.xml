	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study Abiraterone Acetate Patients With Severe Hepatic Impairment Compared Patients With Normal Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized ( individual assign chance study treatment ) , open-label ( individual know identity study treatment ) , single dose , 2-cohort study abiraterone acetate approximately 16 adult men . Participants either severe hepatic impairment ( Cohort 1 ) qualify control group normal hepatic function ( Cohort 2 ) . This study consist screen period follow 4-day open-label treatment phase subsequently 28-day follow study dose abiraterone acetate suspension . Patients admit study center Day -1 , single dose study drug administer morning Day 1 , patient remain study center completion 72-hour pharmacokinetic ( PK ; study body drug ) blood sample collection morning Day 4 . Enrollment begin sequentially patient severe hepatic impairment cohort . Enrollment Cohort 1 stagger order evaluate safety tolerability . The study proceed &gt; =Grade 3 toxicity serious adverse event consider related abiraterone acetate observe . Additional patient may enrol least 8 patient cohort complete require assessment , include PK blood sample collection . The aim treat remain patient Cohort 1 suspension dose yield exposure equivalent 1000 mg tablet healthy individual . If dose adjust Study Evaluation Team review , additional patient may enrol ensure least 8 patient complete study final dose . Once enrollment patient severe hepatic impairment cohort complete , matched-control cohort dose . Serial PK sample collect open-label treatment phase detail protocol . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participant cancer free body mass index ( BMI ) 18 kg/m2 40 kg/m2 , inclusive , body weight less 50 kg . Cohort 1is characterize severe hepatic impairment ( describe ChildPugh Classification C ) . Cohort 2 represent match control characterize healthy participant normal hepatic function . Control cohort participant age match Â± 10 year BMI match within 20 % mean severe hepatic impairment cohort ; clinical criterion match . Control cohort participant must good health , clinically significant finding medical history , physical examination , laboratory evaluation , 12lead electrocardiogram vital sign . Patients hepatic impairment require medication and/or treatment regimen treat underlying hepatic impairment medical condition dose study drug . Participants control cohort test positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C antibody permit enroll study . Patients hepatic impairment acute exacerbate hepatitis , fluctuate rapidly deteriorate hepatic function indicate widely vary worsen clinical and/or laboratory sign hepatic impairment judgment either investigator sponsor 's medical monitor exclude participate study . Patients hepatic impairment take antiviral therapy treatment active hepatitis infection time screening , previously diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma , history biliary sepsis within past 2 year . Patients severe hepatic impairment Gilbert 's syndrome &gt; = Grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy patient lack capacity provide inform consent judged investigator . Mild moderate hepatic encephalopathy would impede informed consent investigator 's judgment permit .</criteria>
