	<criteria>Healthy define free clinically significant illness disease determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory test ECG . Rationale : Set appropriate selection healthy male Japanese healthy male 20 55 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Rationale : Set appropriate evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 healthy Japanese male Body weight great equal 50.0 kg BMI within range 18.5 equal less 25.0 kg/m2 . Rationale : To include standard figure base obesity criterion Obesity Association Japan , range establish Nonsmoker exsmoker cease smoke least 6 month . Rationale : Set appropriate evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 healthy Japanese male AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase total bilirubin less equal ULN screening . Rationale : Set appropriate evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 healthy Japanese male Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Rationale : Set consideration ethic study accordance GCP . Single QTc [ QTcF ] le 450 msec . Rationale : Set appropriate evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 healthy Japanese male A positive test syphilis , Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis B surface antibody , Hepatitis B core antibody , positive Hepatitis C antibody , HIV antigen /antibody , HTLV1 antibody screen . Rationale : Set appropriate selection healthy subject consideration safety staff handle measure blood sample . A positive prestudy drug screen screen . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History regular alcohol consumption exceed , average , 14 drinks/week men ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 350 mL beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit ) within 6 month screen . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . The subject participate clinical study postmarketing study investigational noninvestigational product previous 4 month precede administration study medication study . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior dose day . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . The subject plan concurrently participate another clinical study postmarketing study . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement within 14 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior administration study medication . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy exclude pollen allergy without current symptom . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 400 mL within 4 month 200 mL within 2 month . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Rationale : Set secure study quality Subject mentally legally incapacitate . Rationale : Set secure study quality Subjects ECG result consider clinically significant investigator . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . Subjects supine systolic blood pressure le 90 mmHg great than140 mmHg and/or supine diastolic blood pressure le 55 mmHg great 90 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure drop supine stand great 30 mmHg . Rationale : Set consideration subject ' safety relate IV route administration . Immunoglobulin ( M , A , G ) level less LLN screen . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History anaphylactic reaction food , drug , insect bite/sting . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History allergic reaction parenteral administration contrast agent , foreign protein , monoclonal antibody . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History B cell target therapy ( rituximab , antiCD20agents , antiCD22 [ epratuzumab ] , antiCD52 [ alemtuzumab ] , BLySreceptor fusion protein [ BR3 ] , TACIFc , LY2127399 [ antiBAFF ] GSK1550188 ) time . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 . History infection require hospitalization treatment antiviral antibiotic , vaccination within 30 day prior administration study medication . Rationale : To exclude inappropriate subject evaluation safety pharmacokinetics GSK1550188 .</criteria>
