	<criteria>Healthy subject ( smoker nonsmoker ) Subjects investigator believe comply requirement protocol . A male female , include 45 75 year age time consent . Written inform consent obtain subject . Baseline postbronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume air one second ( FEV1 ) &gt; 85 % predict normal value baseline postbronchodilator FEV1/Forced expiratory Vital Capacity ( FVC ) &gt; 70 % predict normal value . Free obvious health problem establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Nonsmokers : subject never smoke OR Smokers : current smoker smoke history ≥ 10 packyears . COPD subject ( frequent nonfrequent exacerbators ) Subjects investigator believe comply requirement protocol . A male female , include 45 75 year age time consent . Written inform consent obtain subject . Baseline postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % &gt; 30 % predict normal value baseline postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % predict normal value . Current former smoker smoke history ≥ 10 packyears . Documented history ≥ one exacerbation within 365 day prior screen visit require treatment systemic corticosteroid result hospitalization . Healthy subject ( smoker nonsmoker ) Use investigational nonregistered product within 30 day prior Screening Visit plan use study . Concurrently participate another clinical study subject expose investigational noninvestigational product . Any know clinically significant anaemia condition per medical record would preclude draw blood describe protocol . Receipt vaccine within 30 day precede blood sampling . Previous vaccination NTHi vaccine . Chronic administration immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within 180 day prior screen visit . Topical steroid allow . Any confirmed suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , base medical history physical examination . Serious chronic disease include medically significant chronic pulmonary , cardiovascular , renal , neurological , psychiatric metabolic disorder , determine medical history physical examination . Any known respiratory disorder . Acute disease and/or fever time Screening Visit Visit 1 , applicable Receipt immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 90 day prior Screening Visit . Receipt interferon within 90 day prior Screening Visit . History malignancy . Subjects history , current , alcohol substance abuse . Known history immunemediated disorder . Recent use antibiotic antiviral drug within 30 day prior Screening Visit . Pregnant female . Other condition investigator judge may interfere study finding . COPD subject ( frequent nonfrequent exacerbators ) Use investigational nonregistered product within 30 day prior Screening Visit plan use study . Use investigational inhale long act muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) , inhale long act beta agonist ( LABA ) inhale corticosteroid allow . Concurrently participate another clinical study subject expose investigational noninvestigational product . Subjects participate clinical study investigational inhaled LAMA and/or LABA and/or inhale corticosteroid enrol . Any know clinically significant anaemia condition per medical record would preclude draw blood describe protocol . Receipt vaccine within 30 day precede blood sampling . Previous vaccination NTHi vaccine . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , base medical history physical examination . Serious , uncontrolled disease likely interfere study finding . Acute disease and/or fever time Screening Visit Visit 1 , applicable Receipt immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 90 day prior Screening Visit . Receipt interferon within 90 day prior Screening Visit . History malignancy . Subjects history , current , alcohol substance abuse . Known history immunemediated disease COPD . Recent use antibiotic antiviral drug within 30 day prior Screening Visit . Subject experience COPD exacerbation require antibiotic , systemic corticosteroid hospitalisation resolve least one month prior Screening Visit least 30 day follow last dose oral corticosteroid . Chronic administration immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within 180 day precede screen visit . Subjects severe COPD , GOLD stage IV . Primary diagnosis asthma . Other respiratory disorder sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , lung cancer , lung fibrosis , cystic fibrosis . A known diagnosis α1 antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . History lung surgery . Pregnant female . Other condition investigator judge may interfere study finding .</criteria>
