	<brief_summary>This research look marker blood people spinal cord injury may sign injury severity , serve clue degree recovery . Investigators would also like compare marker profile patient neurological condition stroke Guillain-Barre syndrome . Patients participate trial accept neuro-rehabilitation Sheba medical center , Israel . They join trial arrival ward , le 2 week begin condition , later 3 month . Patients examine research staff three time : 1 . At arrival , patient neurologically examine functional ability assess . Blood drawn send lab . 2 . At 6 month begin neurological condition repeat : patient neurologically examine functional ability assess , blood drawn send lab . 3 . The final examination take place 1 year begin neurological condition . This time neurological functional ability assess without blood test . The blood sample test research lab . Then investigator shall compare clinical finding laboratory finding , see marker find reflect injury severity predict recovery .</brief_summary>
