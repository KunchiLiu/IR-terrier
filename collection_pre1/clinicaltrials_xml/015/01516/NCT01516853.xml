	<brief_summary>The purpose study validate magnetic resonance image biomarker hepatic iron concentration ( HIC ) . Excessive accumulation iron body highly toxic , specifically liver . Accurate , non-invasive assessment HIC need diagnosis , quantitative staging treatment monitor hepatic iron overload .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Quantification Liver Iron With MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive accumulation iron body result abnormal intestinal absorption hereditary hemochromatosis repeat intravenous blood transfusion ( ie : transfusional hemosiderosis ) . Excess body iron highly toxic , require treatment aim reduce body iron store . Measurement body iron store critical detection iron overload , stag severity monitor iron-reducing therapy often extremely expensive ( &gt; $ 40,000/year ) carry toxicity . MRI show sensitive presence iron . The investigator develop MRI-based method rapid iron quantification ( instance , whole liver single breath-hold ) . The purpose work validate new method use FDA-approved Ferriscan technique ( Resonance Health , Claremont , Australia ) reference standard .</detailed_description>
