	<brief_title>Assess Safety Efficacy NKPL66 ( CaPre™ ) Treatment Mild-to-high Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data generate preclinical study , well data accumulate preclinical clinical study conduct precursor CaPre™ , NKO® , natural health product ( NPN : 80006416 ) , show CaPre™ safe product well tolerate . In addition , preclinical data demonstrate CaPre™ effective reduce circulate plasma concentration triglyceride . This effect also accompany regulation blood lipid , glucose tolerance inflammatory biomarkers . These study conduct several preclinical adult phenotype : ( 1 ) Healthy Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rat , ( 2 ) obese dyslipidemic Zucker Diabetic Fatty ( ZDF ) rat ( 3-5 ) three distinct murine phenotype ( normal wild-type C57BL/6 , human ApoA-I transgenic mouse homozygous LDL-receptor knockout ) . As prevalence cardiometabolic disorder progressively increase year , expect augmentation necessity new anti-dyslipidemic medication importantly add combination treatment . Current treatment method address specific target indication , offer complete management dyslipidemia . We leave option either inadequately treat patient suffer cardiovascular metabolic disorder , prescribe combination treatment hop address risk factor mitigate known side effect . A treatment gap exist since medication increase HDL-cholesterol reduces triglycerides reduce LDL-cholesterol without side effect . At present need ass effectiveness CaPre™ reduce triglyceride patient high hypertriglyceridemia . The current study address issue generate evidence require determine whether product could effectively use clinical management patient population .</detailed_description>
