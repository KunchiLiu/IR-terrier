	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate prospectively impact two protective mechanical ventilation strategy , use low tidal volume ventilation ( 6 mL/kg/ibw ) cardiac surgery . The study select patient present signal deficient gas exchange ( PaO2/FIO2 &lt; 250 PEEP [ positive end expiratory pressure ] 5 cmH2O ) immediate post-operative period . An aggressive alveolar recruitment protocol apply opening pressure 45 cmH2O , follow ventilation PEEP = 13 cmH2O , compare standard alveolar recruitment protocol institution , open pressure 20 cmH2O airway follow ventilation PEEP = 8 cmH2O . After stabilize period four hour control mechanical ventilation , patient follow routine weaning protocol physiotherapy protocol institution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The postoperative period cardiac surgery associate development pulmonary complication . Functional residual capacity reduce 50 % pulmonary volume may decrease three month surgery . Lung injury result pulmonary inflammation ( activated cardiopulmonary bypass , surgical procedure ischemia-reperfusion injury ) , adopt mechanical ventilation strategy consequence previous cardiac and/or pulmonary dysfunction . The use protective mechanical ventilation strategy low tidal volume since immediate postoperative period , since operating room , show attenuate prevent lung injury previous study select high-risk patient . A complex topic , however , proof additional benefit alveolar recruitment maneuver brief period mechanical ventilation surgery . While experimental evidence suggest use open lung approach could minimize shear force lung parenchyma , enhance protection afford low tidal volume ventilation , innumerous concern hemodynamic side effect , possibility barotrauma prevent routine use intensive alveolar recruitment protocol . Another matter concern net efficacy recruitment maneuver apply post-operative period , instead intra-operative period . Thus , study compare impact two protective mechanical ventilation strategy , use low-tidal volume ventilation ( 6 mL/kg/ibw ) cardiac surgery , selective population patient present signal deficient gas exchange ( PaO2/FIO2 &lt; 250 PEEP 5 cmH2O ) immediate post-operative period . In previous study institution , subgroup patient show high risk postoperative pulmonary complication . During short period control mechanical ventilation patient arrival operate theater , aggressive alveolar recruitment protocol apply opening pressure 45 cmH2O , follow ventilation PEEP = 13 cmH2O , compare standard alveolar recruitment protocol institution , open pressure 20 cmH2O airway follow ventilation PEEP = 8 cmH2O . After stabilize period four hour control mechanical ventilation , patient follow routine weaning protocol physiotherapy protocol institution . Our hypothesis aggressive alveolar recruitment strategy might help reversal collapse create surgery short term mechanical ventilation anesthesia patient transportation . Previous study show effect may extend post-extubation period , impair lung function day . Thus , test effect aggressive alveolar recruitment protocol translate good lung compliance , good gas exchange , few pulmonary complication post-operative period ( latter primary outcome ) . Analysis length stay also scrutinize , consist secondary outcome . All hemodynamic complication report , since also anticipate event hemodynamic impairment might frequent aggressive recruitment arm , eventually obscure expect benefit .</detailed_description>
