	<brief_summary>This research do study safety utility 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA ) ( also know Gliolan ) identify brain tumor tissue surgery . The goal study determine 5-ALA differentiate tumor normal brain tissue . Sometimes , brain surgery , removal tumor tissue difficult tumor look like normal brain tissue . Studies country show brain tumor , 5-ALA make tumor appear bright ultraviolet light . This may make easy doctor remove much tumor safely possible brain . This study also hop see 5-ALA find different cell population within tumor remove allow researcher well understand brain tumor . The purpose study : - Find well 5-ALA separate normal brain tissue tumor tissue AND see well 5-ALA find different cell population within brain tumor - Identify amount 5-ALA take surgery make tumor glow ultraviolet light - Make sure 5-ALA identifies tumor normal brain - Make sure 5-ALA cause side effect</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must clinically document primary brain tumor resection clinically indicate . Radiographic finding consistent high grade glioma . Intraoperative frozen section either : anaplastic astrocytoma ( WHO Grade III astrocytoma ) glioblastoma ( WHO Grade IV astrocytoma ) . Patients must age great 18 year old Karnofsky Performance Score &gt; 70 ( Appendix ) Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000 /uL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL Platelets &gt; 100,000/uL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST/ALT within normal institutional limit Creatinine within normal institutional limit Prior craniotomy resection , deep seat tumor thalamus brain stem . History allergic reaction compound similar chemical composition ALA . Personal family history porphyrias Personal history hepatitis liver disease . Pregnant woman exclude study ALA unknown teratogenic effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ALA , breastfeed discontinue prior treatment ALA . Inability undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( i.e . patient AICD/pacemakers ) .</criteria>
