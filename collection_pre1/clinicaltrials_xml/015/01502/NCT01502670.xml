	<brief_summary>This study look [ 18 ] FACBC go lung nodule . This hopefully lead development well image technique look lung nodule . [ 18 ] FACBC approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) . This study help determine approve FDA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amino Acid Tracer ( FACBC ) Positron Emission Tomography Lung Nodule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test compound ( chemical substance ) small amount radioactivity attach . This substance natural tendency go tumor cell , show detection stag prostate cancer brain tumor . In study go test new substance patient lung nodule . Lung nodules common finding . It important non-invasively determine whether nodule cancer , early cancer detection treatment may cure disease . The substance call [ 18 ] FACBC give form injection vein . After substance reach lung nodule , scan call PET Positron Emission Tomography , do . This similar CAT scan x-ray . Usually compound call [ 18 ] FDG use PET scan substance often go inflammatory tissue well . This new substance significantly go inflammatory tissue , may allow tumor lung well identify .</detailed_description>
