	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct randomize blind placebo-controlled clinical trial patient chronic TMD ( N=20 ) . Patients randomly assign receive either active treatment ( caloric vestibular neurostimulation ) placebo . Data collect prior treatment thermal mechanical pain threshold , clinical sign symptom TMD , adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) musculoskeletal pain condition characterize pain temporomandibular joint and/or masticatory muscle . TMD amongst common chronic musculoskeletal condition affect 6 12 % general population yet medicine approve specifically treatment . TMD cause substantial suffer TMD pain common symptom compels patient seek therapy . One study find average rating pain intensity due TMD 4.3 10-point scale , similar average report chest pain back pain . Studies consistently find TMD pronounce impact quality life . Thus , new successful approach TMD therapy would significant clinical economic impact . Caloric vestibular stimulation ( CVS ) routine diagnostic test assessment vestibular function Central nervous system pathology . It usually conduct instill cold warm water external ear canal show activate anterior cingulate , temporoparietal insular cortex . In addition use diagnostic test , CVS also show reduce pain several chronic condition include migraine , phantom limb pain , spinal cord injury , thalamic pain , complex regional pain syndrome . Central sensitization common feature pain condition show alleviated CVS . It dysfunctional state central nervous system pain longer couple noxious peripheral stimulus . In presence central sensitization response noxious stimulus exaggerate prolonged ( hyperalgesia ) may involve area outside site injury ( secondary hyperalgesia ) . Pain also arise spontaneously elicit innocuous stimulus ( allodynia ) . While neural mechanism underlie development TMD poorly understand , accumulate evidence central sensitization play critical role TMD pathogenesis . It propose cyclical process TMD pain result central sensitization turn predispose patient pain . Thus treatment reverse central sensitization turn result decrease pain . Caloric vestibular stimulation ( CVS ) safe effective procedure use diagnosis brainstem injury balance assessment . As noted already , intrigue observation literature suggest caloric vestibular stimulation lead abatement pain . When caloric stimulation ( warm cool relative body temperature ) apply ear canal , conduction ( primarily via dense bone ) inner ear , particular prominence lateral semicircular canal ( SCC ) , set convection current endolymph . The resultant deformation cupula ( membrane span ampula SCC ) lead phasic change tonic firing rate hair cell base cupula , thereby alter fire rate afferent vestibular nerve ( thus device deliver CVS may view class neurostimulator ) . The afferent map nuclei brainstem ( well phylogenetically ancient , direct connection , e.g . thalamus hippocampus ) fastigial nucleus cerebellum . It hypothesize method action CVS pain relate alteration phasic firing rate vestibular nerve afferent , turn alters activation receive area ( brainstem cerebellum ) . The primary impediment therapeutic application CVS lack clinical device provide control , prolong , repeatable caloric stimulation . The use `` ice water '' irrigation use syrinx even water/air irrigators use balance study practical treatment regimen extend 10 minute . Further , applicant believe control , time-varying thermal waveform essential avoid effect adaptation cupula , attenuate control phasic fire rate hair cell .</detailed_description>
