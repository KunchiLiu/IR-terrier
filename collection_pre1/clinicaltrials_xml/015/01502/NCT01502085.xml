	<detailed_description>lenalidomide investigate combination lenalidomide bortezomib regimen . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study study doctor try find ; safe dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treating relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental FDA approve combination . Your receive 25mg lenalidomide day 1-21 every 28 day . Vorinostat drug interfere life sustain function tumor cell . It already receive regulatory approval U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment T-cell non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma United States . The usage vorinostat Multiple Myeloma experimental ( investigational ) approve FDA , study combination proteasome inhibitor ( bortezomib ) immunomodulatory ( lenalidomide ) agent ongoing . You receive either 400mg vorinostat day 1-7 15-21 every 28 day . Dexamethasone steroid know cause cell death multiple myeloma . Dexamethasone FDA approve treatment multiple myeloma many disease state . You receive either Dexamethasone 40mg less 75 year age 20mg age 75 year day 1 , 8 , 15 22 every 28 day In research study investigator look evaluate safety efficacy vorinostat combine lenalidomide dexamethasone treat relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma , refractory lenalidomide .</detailed_description>
