	<brief_summary>One devastate complication coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) postoperative stroke . While multiple cause stroke CABG , particle generate handle aorta believe account neurologic effect . Handling aorta CABG occur several time operation . One strategy reduce aortic handling avoid cardiopulmonary bypass altogether use off-pump technique ( OPCAB ) . Another method avoid use aortic clamp and/or use device require aortic clamping . This study test hypothesis off-pump ( OPCAB ) approach device perform clampless surgery result least amount aortic handling therefore low incidence frequency neurologic adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One devastate complication coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) postoperative stroke . While etiology stroke CABG multifactorial , atheroemboli generate aortic manipulation believe account cerebral embolic event . Manipulation aorta CABG occur aortic cannulation , institution maintenance cardiopulmonary bypass , aortic clamp unclamping either cross-clamp , partial-occluding clamp , . One operative strategy minimize aortic manipulation avoid cardiopulmonary bypass altogether use off-pump technique ( OPCAB ) . Another method avoid use aortic clamp construct proximal aortocoronary anastomosis facilitate device require aortic clamping . The effect strategies reduce cerebral embolic event underlie mechanism reduction well-defined . This study test hypothesis off-pump ( OPCAB ) approach facilitate device perform clampless proximal anastomosis result least amount aortic manipulation therefore low incidence frequency cerebral embolic event . The approach associate low incidence TCD-detected cerebral embolic event also result low incidence severity postoperative neurocognitive decline . Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography establish method detect cerebral embolic signal cardiac surgery utilized detect cerebral embolic event operation . After on- off-pump strategy select , patient subsequently randomize one two clamping strategy . There 4 group patient : 1 ) OPCAB patient randomize clamping ( facilitating device ) ; 2 ) OPCAB patient randomize partial clamping ; 3 ) on-pump patient randomize double clamping ; 4 ) on-pump patient randomize single clamp strategy .</detailed_description>
