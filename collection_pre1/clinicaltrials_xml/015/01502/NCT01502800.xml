	<detailed_description>This open label , dose escalation study ARQ 761 . Drug administration regimen design two part . Part I single-arm , non-randomized dose-escalation study . Part II multi-arm , randomize dose-escalation study . It design establish clinical tolerability MTD ARQ 761 recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . This first-in-human study ARQ 761 . PART I ARQ 761 administer intravenously start dose 195 mg/m2 IV weekly . A cycle patient already enrol consist weekly administration ARQ 761 cycle repeat every 4 week ( 28 day ) . PART II Alternate dose regimen ARQ 761 evaluate start dose 390 mg/m2 . ARQ 761 administer intravenously assign duration ( 2 h 3 h ) weekly , biweekly two consecutive week follow one week rest . Patient randomize Arm A , B C enrollment . Depending toxicity observe , seven treatment cohort enrol dose escalation occur double ( first escalation ) 40 % increment thereafter . If dose tolerate level pharmacokinetic data suggest continue escalation warrant , additional dose level consider . Patients enrol assessed dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) eligible intra-patient dose escalation . Pharmacokinetic assessment perform first forth infusion day follow different regimen maintain continuity among treatment group . Safety tolerability ARQ 761 assess duration study treatment . Evaluation potential anti-tumor activity ARQ 761 perform regular interval patient remain study . Dose escalation ARQ 761 proceed maximum tolerate dose recommended Phase 2 dose reach . Intra-patient escalation lower dose level successfully administer dose level allow . In order patient low dose level eligible dose escalation , must tolerate therapy without experience DLT . In addition , prior escalation , complete cohort three patient must complete two cycle therapy high dose level without experience DLTs . Patients receive dos ARQ 761 may escalate maximum two time next consecutive cohort . Subjects enrol accord 3+3 dose escalation scheme . Treatment stagger first patient treat dose level receive initial infusion least 1 week prior subsequent patient cohort . At least 3 patient within dose cohort must complete first cycle therapy prior enrol subject next dose level .</detailed_description>
