	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine difference post-concussive ( PC ) symptom endorsement among four group Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) /Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Veterans : history target , service-related , mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) ( Group 1 ) ; history target , service-related , mTBI ( Group 2 ) ; PTSD ( Group 3 ) ; history target , service-related , mTBI PTSD ( Group 4 ) examining score Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory ( NSI ) . Support study provide previous research highlight complex relationship mTBI , PTSD subsequent PC symptom endorsement ( Brenner et al . 2010 ; Terrio et al , 2009 ) . HYPOTHESES ARE AS FOLLOWS : 1 . Individuals history target , service-related , mTBI ( Group 2 ) individual PTSD ( Group 3 ) report significantly PC symptom , measure NSI total score , compare history service-related mTBI PTSD ( Group 4 ) . 2 . Individuals co-occurring target , service-related , mTBI history PTSD ( Group 1 ) report significantly PC symptom , measure total NSI score , either target , service-related , mTBI ( Group 2 ) PTSD ( Group 3 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Archival data collect OEF/OIF Veterans see VA ECHCS TBI Clinic Nancy Cutter , M.D . team January 1 , 2009 December 31 , 2010 . Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) progress note title `` OEF/OIF TBI 2nd Level Evaluation Consult Report '' `` TBI Consult Report '' use identify potential subject . Power base primary hypothesis PTSD ( Group 3 ) target , service-related mTBI ( Group 2 ) significantly PC symptom report history target , service-related mTBI PTSD ( Group 4 ) . Belanger et al . ( 2010 ) report standard deviation 15.3 NSI total score sample 134 mTBI subject . Assuming variability similar Belanger study , significance level 0.025 correct two comparison 80 % power , 180 subject per group detect clinically significant difference 5 point . For simplicity , calculate use two-sided , two-sample t-test . Given model four group together , pool standard error estimate use , result slightly high power . All analysis assume two-sided test hypothesis overall significance level 0.05 , unless otherwise note , perform either Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS ) v9.2 ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) . Demographic characteristic report mean standard deviation ; median range ; proportion , appropriate . Likewise , characteristic compare four aforementioned subject group use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) , chi-square test and/or nonparametric test appropriate . Hypothesis 1 : An ANOVA reference cell cod utilized model NSI total score function four group ( Group 1 : Individuals co-occurring target , service-related , mTBI PTSD ; Group 2 : target , service-related , mTBI ; Group 3 : PTSD ; Group 4 : history target , service-related , mTBI PTSD ) . Potential confounders assess individually add model group . If group parameter estimate change 10 % inclusion potential confounder , variable utilized final model . Once final model determine , contrast set within model test ( 1 ) PTSD v . Neither ( 2 ) target , service-related , mTBI v . Neither , Bonferroni correction employ significance level adjust 0.025 two primary test . Estimated mean difference report 95 % CIs . Potential confounding variable consider : age ; gender ; total number deployment ; time since last deployment ; time since early document mTBI ; time since target , service-related , mTBI ; total number mTBIs . Hypothesis 2 : Within final model , contrast use test ( 1 ) co-occurring target , service-related , mTBI PTSD vs. PTSD ( 2 ) co-occurring target , service-related , mTBI PTSD vs. target , service-related , mTBI .</detailed_description>
