	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study study doctor think disease require treatment time , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . You equal chance assign either group : - If Group 1 , receive inhale form ribavirin . You inhale ribavirin 3 time day 3 hour time tent hospital room . You receive drug 10 day . - If Group 2 , take capsule ribavirin 3 time day 10 day . If study doctor think disease require treatment time , assign Group 3 . If Group 3 , receive treatment ribavirin , test procedure study visit describe . Study Visits : At study visit , ask feeling , side effect symptom may , drug may take . On Day 3 ( +/- 1 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign - Your nasal passage check RSV . On Days 7 14 ( +/- 1 day ) : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign - Your nasal passage check RSV . Length Study : If Groups 1 2 , receive study drug 10 day . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If doctor think need treatment longer 10 day , receive part routine care . This may mean change receive drug inhale form begin study receive mouth . All participant end-of-study follow-up visit , describe . End-of-Study Visit : If Groups 1 2 , end-of-study visit 14 day last dose study drug . If Group 3 , end-of-study visit take place Day 21 . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check RSV antibody . - Your nasal passage check RSV . - You ask feel , side effect symptom may , drug may take . Follow-Up Visit : About 6 10 week last dose study drug , pulmonary function test check lung function . This investigational study . Ribavirin FDA approve commercially available treatment hepatitis C give mouth , severe RSV child inhale . Giving drug adult weak immune system stem cell transplant investigational . Up 96 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
