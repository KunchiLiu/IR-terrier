	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma , Wilms Tumor , Liver Cancer , Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate sorafenib tosylate ( sorafenib ) child relapse refractory rhabdomyosarcoma , Wilms tumor , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define describe toxicity sorafenib administer oral , twice-daily continuous schedule . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics sorafenib child refractory cancer . III . To estimate progression-free survival sorafenib rhabdomyosarcoma , Wilms tumor , hepatocellular carcinoma compare group patient enrol select closed Phase II study Children Oncology Group ( COG ) . IV . To assess biologic activity sorafenib vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) peripheral blood sample . ( Exploratory ) V. To evaluate presence BRAF mutation RET/PTC rearrangement patient PTC . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( rhabdomyosarcoma v Wilms tumor v hepatocellular carcinoma v papillary thyroid carcinoma ) . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic study , VEGF VEGFR-2 analysis ELISA . Previously collect formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sample , patient papillary thyroid carcinoma , also analyze BRAF mutation RET/PTC rearrangements PCR . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
