	<brief_title>Intercalated Administration PamCis With Gefitinib Placebo First Line Lung Adenocarcinoma Never Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators believe PFS curve crossing-over IPASS First-SIGNAL study mainly due early progression EGFR mutation-negative tumor gefitinib alone . Taken together FASTACT trial result , PFS curve crossing-over may well avert effective chemotherapy give together gefitinib optimum timing sequence . Apparently , time EGFR-TKI administration within chemotherapy cycle critical , show OSI 9774 trial . In placebo-controlled randomized phase II , Investigators propose give gefitinib day 5-18 3-weekly chemotherapy cycle pemetrexed/cisplatin avoid potential overlap EGFR-TKI effect chemotherapy vice versa . Investigators would like generate promising pilot data , warrant large phase III trial . Investigators hope show intercalated administration Iressa® ( gefitinib ) Pemetrexed/platinum regimen improve outcome never-smokers advance ( stage IIIB/IV ) lung adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
