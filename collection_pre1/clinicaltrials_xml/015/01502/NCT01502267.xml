	<brief_title>Desensitization Protocol Highly Sensitized Patients Waiting List Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HLA sensitization know important barrier decease donor kidney allocation . Therefore , investigator need develop good strategy manage pre-sensitized patient use desensitization protocol . In study investigator use two kind medication reduction circulate antibody ( high dose IVIg , B cell deplete agent ) highly-sensitized patient wait list decease donor kidney transplantation . After desensitization , investigator check treatment increase chance receive kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
