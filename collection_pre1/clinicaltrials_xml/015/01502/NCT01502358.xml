	<detailed_description>Arguably need tetravalent dengue vaccine effectively induce immunity four dengue serotypes never great . Currently , several different approach take develop protective tetravalent dengue vaccine . These include live-attenuated vaccine derive serial passage tissue culture , live chimeric vaccine , recombinant protein vaccine DNA vaccine . While live attenuate live chimeric vaccine show promise clinical trial , viral competition suspect immune interference result imbalanced immune response reactogenicity occurrence dengue like symptom remains concern . It imperative candidate vaccine produce solid immunity four dengue virus serotypes . Failure may place recipient vaccine risk develop severe dengue disease ( dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome ) follow exposure virus serotype incomplete protective immunity , result antibody dependent enhancement due presence non-neutralizing anti-dengue antibody .</detailed_description>
