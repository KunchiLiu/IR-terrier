	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize , open-label , active-control trial compare effectiveness intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® , Allergan ) versus sacral neuromodulation ( InterStim® , Medtronic ) treatment refractory urge urinary incontinence . In addition , study evaluate select technical attribute intervention well effect two intervention low urinary tract pelvic floor symptom . Hypothesis : InterStim® therapy result great reduction daily urge urinary incontinence episodes 6-month follow-up period compare Botox A® injection . A supplemental study investigate whether biological marker include related inflammation connective tissue remodel change follow treatment Botox A® Interstim® .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Refractory Overactive Bladder : Sacral NEuromodulation v. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment ( ROSETTA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To compare change baseline number urge urinary incontinence episode ( UUIE ) 6 six month follow-up period woman randomize sacral neuromodulation ( InterStim® ) therapy , versus randomize intra-detrusor injection 200 unit botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® ) . Secondary Aims : - Long Term Efficacy : To compare long-term ( 12 24 month ) efficacy outcome woman randomize sacral neuromodulation ( InterStim® ) therapy , versus randomize intra-detrusor injection 200 unit botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® ) . Secondary efficacy outcome , collect 12 24 month well 6 month , include adequate control urge urinary incontinence , change bothersome symptom urinary urge incontinence ( UUI ) , severity urge incontinence , urinary frequency , nocturia , subject satisfaction therapy , quality life measure bowel sexual function . - Cost Effectiveness : To compare utilization medical resource cost effectiveness analysis cost-utility treatment group . - Treatment Safety Burden : To assess safety profile treatment burden intervention compare adverse event incidence treatment arm , also obtain estimate incidence treatment-specific safety burden outcome . Safety burden outcome Botox A® injection include receipt additional injection intermittent catheterization due void dysfunction/partial urinary retention . Safety burden outcome InterStim® device include infection , pain , lead migration , reprogramming ( reason ) surgical revision ( reason ) .</detailed_description>
