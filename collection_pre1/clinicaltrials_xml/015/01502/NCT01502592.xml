	<brief_summary>This study do evaluate safety two strategy call `` cryoablation '' `` immune therapy '' woman curable early stage breast cancer . `` Cryoablation '' procedure perform expert doctor call radiologist . The radiologist use ( magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) insert needle directly cancer . Very cold temperature apply needle kill cancer cell . Some kill cancer cell broken piece recognize person 's immune system . The `` immune therapy '' study drug call ipilimumab . Normally immune system make `` T cell '' kill cancer cell turn . The cancer-killing T cell activity control molecule call CTLA4 . Ipilimumab work turn CTLA4 . Turning CTLA4 allows cancer-fighting T cell remain active Ipilimumab antibody drug make laboratory patient use recently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient type skin cancer call melanoma . An antibody normal protein immune system use find kill germ like bacteria virus . This study do researcher believe cryoablation combine immune therapy , person 's immune system train recognize person 's cancer . This may prevent cancer come back future . In word , hop add cryoablation ipilimumab mastectomy , body remain cancer free long mastectomy perform . The first step determine whether cryoablation immune therapy use cure breast cancer evaluate safety strategy alone combination small group patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women age 18 year old Confirmed histologic diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast , include MSKCC pathology confirmation ER , PR HER2 test progress ( i.e . outside MSKCC biopsy report ) HER2positive pathology permit Operable tumor measure ≥1.5 cm maximal diameter Any nodal status Multifocal multicentric disease permit . Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer permit No indication distant metastases Total mastectomy plan Tumor amenable cryoablation determine radiologist ECOG performance status score 0 1 Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : White blood cell ( WBCs ) ≥ 2000/μL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL ( glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40 ml/min ) AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin within normal limit ( except subject Gilbert 's syndrome , must total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) Negative HIV screen test Negative screening test Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. Patients positive result indicate true active chronic infection may enroll discussion consensus agreement treat physician principal investigator . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use acceptable method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study least 3 month last dose ipilimumab manner risk pregnancy minimize . See definition WOCBP . WOCBP must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day first study intervention . Women must breastfeed . Willing adhere study visit schedule prohibition restriction specify protocol . Definition WOCBP Women childbearing potential include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Post menopause define : Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL Women irregular menstrual period document FSH level &gt; 35 mIU/mL Women hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . Inflammatory breast cancer Medical history concurrent diseases Autoimmune disease : subject document history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease exclude study subject history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) . Subjects motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre Syndrome ) exclude study . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent poorly control diarrhea . Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies ) Chronic use immunosuppressant and/or systemic corticosteroid ( used management cancer noncancerrelated illness ) . However , use corticosteroid allow treatment immune related Adverse Events ( irAEs ) , adrenal insufficiency . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab . Prior treatment CD137 agonist , ipilimumab CTLA4 inhibitor ; Prior investigational agent within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab ; Prior therapy anticancer agent include chemotherapy , adjuvant chemotherapy , immunosuppressive agent , surgery radiotherapy within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab .</criteria>
