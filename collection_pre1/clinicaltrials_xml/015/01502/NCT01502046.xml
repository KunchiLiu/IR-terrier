	<brief_summary>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder , relate abnormal expansion CAG triplets huntingtin gene , characterize motor , cognitive behavioral abnormality , without know effective symptomatic treatment without know disease slow strategy . The severe neuropathological lesion observe HD take place striatum , one brain area important motor control rich cannabinoid receptor ( CBR ) . CBR subdivide two class : CB1R locate neuron play role neuronal function ; CB2R brain locate mostly microglia modulate neuroinflammation . CBR disappear early course HD , massive drop cell striatum . Cannabinoid transmission also early event brain animal model HD . In R6/2 mouse , carry large CAG expansion develop early severe HD phenotype suppression CB1R gene accelerate development severe clinical syndrome characteristic brain inclusion abnormality synaptic density . R6/2 treat mice treat cannabinoids improve clinical phenotype , brain lesion , synaptic density level BNDF , neurotrophic factor enhances survival resistance striatal neuron . Preliminary study cannabinoids patient HD show compound safe patient . Those study , however , show efficacy 1 ) underpowered statistical point view , 2 ) perform isolated pure cannabinoids , instead physiological stimulation mixture compound , 3 ) use insensitive clinical parameter instead sensitive end point , pathogenically important biomarkers . The investigator propose phase II trial combination cannabinoids evaluation safety , profile adverse event , efficacy , accord change important biomarkers</brief_summary>
