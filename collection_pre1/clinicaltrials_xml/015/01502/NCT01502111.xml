	<detailed_description>Advanced airway management ventilatory control generally regard vital management seriously ill injured patient , critical intervention patient out-of-hospital emergency . However , intervention like endotracheal intubation suffer lack clear evidence beneficial effect . Despite publication numerous airway management study , inconsistent imprecise reporting data across heterogenous patient population EMS system persist . The question , , pre-hospital advance airway management perform remains dispute . Several author propose appropriate guideline algorithms management prehospital airway difficult intubation . The guideline emphasize importance promote patient safety avoid error , also recognise importance rescuer level airway skill competence . Drug-assisted rapid sequence intubation ( RSI ) important , potentially harmful , component prehospital advance airway management EMS service . Even physicians work prehospital scene may find challenge maintain adequate level advance airway competence order stay proficient . Better train method system warrant . The recognition endotracheal intubation `` complex intervention '' mark need international standard document report data prehospital intubation severely injured ill patient , alongside standardization research data collection eliminate confound factor . An international airway management expert group recently develop Utstein-style template uniform reporting data prehospital advance airway management . Implementing validate template result high quality dataset allow research cooperation comparison airway management practice EMS system , across different patient population . Such dataset hopefully contribute new knowledge field prehospital advance airway management . The specific aim first two study project define follow : 1 . Describe characteristics outcome advance prehospital airway management Helicopter Emergency Medical Services ( HEMS ) provide full range advance emergency airway management . 2 . Identify group critically injure ill patient benefit competent advanced prehospital airway management , identify specific area future research . In multicentre study , enlist 21 key international HEMS service 6 country ( UK , Australia , Hungary , Finland , Switzerland Norway ) , collect data accord Utstein style template 12 month study period start January 1 , 2012 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient require receive prehospital advance airway management HEMS primary mission . Advanced airway management define attempted insertion advance airway adjunct ( include endotracheal intubation , alternative airway , surgical airway /cricothyroidectomy ) administration ventilatory assistance/support ( include bagmask ventilationBMV , BIPAP/CPAP ventilatory support ) . Advanced prehospital advance airway management define airway management beyond manual opening airway use simple airway adjunct , Guedel airway supplemental oxygen Patients receive advance airway management socalled secondary mission ( interhospital transfer ) .</criteria>
