	<brief_summary>Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) add burden care intensive care patient may cause death patient prolong intensive care stay complicate illness way . The risk infection dependent interplay bacteria load lung immune status . There lot focus bacteria load reduction include use subglottic suctioning attempt reduce amount bacteria may move lung . The Hi Lo tube design allow subglottic suction significantly effective reduce incidence ventilator associate pneumonia compare normal tube . A new generation endotracheal tubes incorporate subglottic suctioning provide snug fit tracheal new taper design may even useful provide solution bacterial load reduction . Conventional tube may furrow allow creation microchannels may aid microaspiration . The taper guard facility subglottic suction well strategy reduce furrow minimum may answer problem ventilator associate pneumonia . This study determine extent protection tube ventilator associate pneumonia compare conventional endotracheal tube</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventilator Associated Pneumonia Taper Guard Versus Normal Tube ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology This prospective randomize trial 2 treatment group 100 patient arm . The control group ( Group C ) intubate conventional endotracheal tubes test group ( Group T ) intubate special Taper guard tube subglottic suction snug fit facility . All adult patient ( &gt; 18 year age ) admit Intensive Care Unit likely receive 72 hour ventilation admit trial . The trial clear Hospital Ethics inform consent obtain patient 's next kin . All patient demographic data collect , primary reason ICU admission , APACHE 2 score , presence infection admission , antibiotic use whether risk factor VAP ( previous surgery , trauma , antibiotic usage , reflux disease use stress ulcer prophylaxis , decrease immune status ) The following guideline modify American Thoracic Society 2005 use basis diagnose Ventilator Associated Pneumonia . Guideline Diagnosis Ventilator Associated Pneumonia ( VAP ) 2 1 . Patient ventilate 48 hour . 2 . Suspicion ventilation associate pneumonia 3 . Presence new progressive infiltrate chest radiograph . 4 . At least 2 follow : 1 . Fever , define oral temperature great 38 degree C , tympanic temperature great 38.5 degree C rectal /core temperature great 39 degree C OR hypothermia , define rectal/core body temperature le 35 degree C. 2 . Elevated total peripheral WBC count ( great 12000/mm3 ) great 15 % band regardless total peripheral WBC count ; leucopenia total peripheral WBC le 4500/mm3 ( cause infection ) 3 . New onset purulent sputum production respiratory secretion ( e.g . tracheal secretion ) , change character sputum tracheal secretion 4 . Worsening hypoxaemia reduction PaO2/ FiO2 great equal 15 % In addition patient aspirants oral cavity ( control group ) subglottic region ( group T ) lung ( group C group T ) send alternate day bacterial culture . All tube inflate sealing pressure leak 20-25 cm H2O whichever low . The sample size estimate base incidence ventilation-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) primary outcome measure studies1,2 . Based VAP incidence 20 % 6 % group , 1:1 ratio , 80 % power significance value 0.05 , number require group 89 . Adding 10 % loss follow-up , number need group 100 give total 200 The assignment patient study randomize accord computer generate random number statistician party ongoing clinical part research . In addition provide allocation sequence via opaque envelope suitable patient identify assignment patient 2 group informed consent obtain . The person intubate patient endotracheal tube use tube allocate accord write instruction inside open opaque envelope . Patient clinical researcher manage patient blind obvious difference 2 type endotracheal tube . However assessor determine presence absence soft sign ventilator associate pneumonia blind type tube use . The Radiologist read Chest Xrays privy type tube use Microbiologist determine significance bacteria identify oral/subglottic secretion tracheal secretion aware endotracheal tube use . The main outcome measure incidence ventilator associate pneumonia day patient ventilate . The secondary outcome length ventilation , duration intensive care stay , duration hospital stay ( pre-intensive care , post-intensive care ) incidence mortality 2 group . Statistics Categorical variable analyse use Chi square test continuous variable analyse use ANOVA . Intention treat analysis use . Analysis carry use SPSS version 15.0 software . All statistical test carry use significance level 0.05 .</detailed_description>
