	<brief_title>Anthropometric Changes Associated With Home-based Exercise Among School Cooks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized clinical trial city Niteroi , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , conduct school year 2007 ( March December 2007 ) . The trial factorial design base two different intervention : 1 ) nutritional counsel 2 ) home-based exercise . The present study focus effect exercise intervention . Of 36 public school spread five different area , select 20 school three area similar demographic socio-economic profile . Because small number male cook ( n=5 ) , include woman neither pregnant breastfeeding . Cooks sick leave work capacity exclude . A total 101 cook eligible , six refuse participate study . All participant receive information goal study sign document indicating inform consent . The study approve institutional review board State University Rio de Janeiro . School cook enrol present study public servant work period eight hour , five day per week , three different shift ( morning , afternoon night ) . They responsible prepare meal serve school cleaning , school machine help perform task . They eat least one meal school . Sample size As previously reported13 ) , sample size calculate assume individual reduction 10 % sugar consumption ( 3.4 gram ) power 80 % 5 % significance level . Anticipating rate participation agreement around 80 % , total sample size estimate 80 school cook . For purpose , 20 school employ total 130 school cook randomize . Intervention Nutritional exercise counsel give school year 2007 ( eight month ) . The nutritional counseling group receive information focus decreasing amount sugar use school meal , well sugar intake . They participate three nutritional education meeting regard sugar intake food label . All activity realize school require 20 minute . In addition , participate contest create reduced-sugar recipe banner , magnet promote reduction sugar intake also provide . All school cook , control nutritional counseling group , participate three discussion session healthy eating . The exercise intervention group receive received booklet physical exercise , consist stretch aerobic exercise could practice home least three time per week 40 minute ( per session ) low-to-moderate intensity ( available www.nebin.org ) . The exercise session divide three part : 1 ) A warm-up routine consist gentle body movement stretch exercise ( 5 minute ) ; 2 ) An aerobic cycle perform circuit continuous movement involve large arm leg muscle , well exercise use ball , rope , stair climbing , stand chair ( balls rope give participant ) ( 30 minute ) ; 3 ) cool-down period , initial stretching exercise perform ( 5 minute ) . The participant encourage engage exercise low-to-moderate intensity low impact least three time week eight month . In first week , woman advise perform 20-minute session , increase gradually ( 10 minutes/session/week ) 40 minute per session . Each session comprise activity ball , rope , stair chair . Additionally , advise reduce exercise intensity felt discomfort ( e.g. , experience breathlessness muscle ache ) . School cook allocate control group receive general information physical activity receive booklet . Measurements The anthropometric variable collect three different time ( baseline , 4 8 month ) , individual food intake , base previously validate food frequency questionnaire14 ) , fast blood sample collect baseline 8 month . Height measure near 0.5 cm wall-mounted stadiometer , body weight measure use calibrated digital scale ( Tanita , BC 533 Inner Scan ) participant . Circumference measurement take large girth hip small girth waist . All anthropometric measurement perform accord standard techniques15 ) . Blood sample collect morning 10 hour fast . Plasma lipid glucose measure use GoldAnalisa kit . The LDL VLDL cholesterol concentration calculate accord Friedewald equation16 ) base triacylglycerol measurement . Physical activity energy expenditure baseline evaluate sub-sample 30 participant use accelerometer ( ActicalÂ® physical activity monitor , Mini Mitter , Bend , OR , USA ) . The accelerometer program accord manufacturer 's instruction enter height , weight , age sex subject . The subject instructed place accelerometer waist wear continuously two consecutive day , except activity contact water could occur ( e.g. , bath ) . Data analysis The characteristic school cook express mean standard deviation , compare two intervention group baseline use Student 's t-test . The effect nutritional counsel home-based exercise weight circumference evaluate repeated random regression ( RRR ) analysis use PROC MIXED SAS ( version 9.1 ; SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) . The analysis effect exercise intervention adjust dietary intervention analysis effect nutritional counselling adjust exercise intervention . The RRR intention-to-treat analysis include observation one subject regardless loss follow-up complies instruction . The term interest treatment X time interaction , estimate rate change outcome time . Residual plots model examine , distribution show major deviation regression assumption . Changes plasma lipid glucose ( sample take twice ) group determine Student 's t-test .</detailed_description>
