	<detailed_description>PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE The propose study aim address two important question regard mechanism underlie weight loss associate exenatide . The investigator primary study objective determine whether Exenatide change rest state activity brain , alters connectivity brain region involve homeostatic hedonic brain circuit . SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVE The secondary study objective determine if/how change differ lean obese subject SIGNIFICANCE Obesity major health problem US many Western country , half population overweight obese . Yet , despite intense research effort mechanisms underlying obesity development novel pharmacologic intervention , bariatric surgery , include gastric bypass surgery successful treatment severe obesity ( le Roux , 2006 ; le Roux , 2007 ) . Mimicking one effect bariatric surgery , e.g . increase secretion glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) could effective strategy obesity ( Torekov , 2011 ) . The impact gut peptide brain regulation ingestive behavior area great interest , since involve signal mechanism may potential target treatment obesity . Both endocrine , paracrine neurocrine ( vagal ) signal pathway involve gut brain signal nutrient relate information ( Holst , 2007 ) . Human study demonstrate long acting hormone like leptin insulin act brain region hypothalamus brainstem , influence food intake response ( Ahima , 2010 ) . More short -term gut signal relay hormone CCK PYY also show human effect subcortical region ( include hypothalamus , nucleus tractus solitarius ( NTS ) , pons , thalamus ) well cortical region ( middle temporal gyrus , insula anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ( Ahima , 2010 ) . Whereas CCK infusion healthy human subject find result increase activity primarily homeostatic brain region ( hypothalamus , brainstem ) , PYY infusion associate increased activity region reward-circuits ( orbitalfrontal cortex , insula , anterior cingulate cortex ) . To knowledge , central effect GLP-1 human study . ( Ahima , 2010 ) HYPOTHESIS 1 . Exenatide change intrinsic activity NTS hypothalamus , connectivity NTS homeostatic hedonic brain circuit 2 . These change see lean obese subject 3 . Changes engagement brain circuit induce Exenatide correlate increased rating satiety follow test meal METHODS The study design double-blind , placebo control , crossover study . Twenty healthy female subject age 18-40 year need The subject divide two age-matched group obese lean woman . The ten obese female BMI 30-35kg/ m2 10 lean female BMI 19-25kg/m2 . All subject ask participate entire protocol 3 visit . There screen visit determine eligibility follow two functional MRI visit subject give subcutaneous injection ( sc ) 10ug Exenatide ( GLP-1 analog ) one visit injection saline MRI visit . The choice female participant base great prevalence obesity woman longstanding interest center 's interest woman 's health . In order control menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuation participant scan follicular phase menstrual cycle , study define 4th-12th day start menstruation . Screening ( Visit 1 ) : All potential subject ask complete initial screen visit approximately 1.5 hour time . This visit take place Gail Gerald Oppenheimer Family Center Neurobiology Stress 10833 Le Conte Ave. , Los Angeles , CA 90095 Room 47-126 . At begin visit , subject give ample time read sign inform consent . The protocol discuss review study MD RN . The screen include medical history physical examination . A urine test pregnancy also do . If pregnancy test positive subject immediately drop participation . Female subject child bear potential ask practice medically approve birth control method study , include oral contraceptive pill , abstinence , double barrier method ( spermicide condom ) , IUD . A menstrual cycle history obtain part medical history first day last menses document . fMRI visit plan follicular stage- specifically day 4-12 cycle . A 5 cc ( 1 tsp ) blood draw glucose collect . If non- fasting blood glucose result 200mg/dl subject consider screen fail . This value choose order exclude subject undiagnosed underlying diabetes . Subjects ask fill several behavioral questionnaire : UCLA bowel symptom questionnaire ( BSQ 5.0 ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression scale ( HAD ) , Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI-Y1 Y2 ) MRI safety screen questionnaire ; require 20 minute complete . The RN , NP MD review inclusion exclusion criterion subject determine eligibility . A brief structured psychological interview ( MINI+ ) do identify major Axis I psychiatric disorder DSM-IV ICD-10 , anxiety , depression , substance abuse phobia . If subject eligible wish participate , provide instruction follow study visit . As noted visit schedule follicular phase individual 's menstrual cycle . Visit 2 MRI scan visit 1 : This visit take approximately 2 hour time . Subject ask fast ( except water ) eight hour prior admission . Eligibility criterion continuance study , include adverse event change medication usage review record . The 1st day last menstrual period note urine pregnancy test perform . If positive subject remove study enrollment . Subjects escort CTSI ( General clinical research area ) IV place four blood draw . A baseline fast blood glucose do . It need 65mg/dl 126mg/dl visit cancel . The subject escort UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center , 660 Charles Young Dr. South , Los Angeles , CA 90095-7085 prepare scanning . Subjects ask complete PROMIS questionnaire prior scan evaluate previous night sleep quality ( RSN analysis ) Fullness Questionnaire ( FQ ) ; visual analog scale use measure hunger satiety . After wanding metal safety escort MRI chamber . They give synopsis study test prepare placement scanner . They monitor pulse oximetry respiratory rate measure autonomic nervous system safety measure ( Exenatide injection ) scanning . These measure collect functional resting state network ( RSN ) scan . Following placement structural scan do After structural scan subject undergo 10-minute rest state ( RSN ) scan ask lie still eye close fall asleep . After RSN scan , subject partially move scanner receive either subcutaneous injection 10ug Exenatide 0.5cc injection saline ( placebo ) upper arm , thigh abdomen . Randomization do UCLA research pharmacy drug store dispense . Subject investigator blind randomization . Immediately follow injection subject move back scanner 8.5 minute structural scanner ( MP Rage : three-dimensional , T1-weighted , gradient-echo sequence use study analysis ) . Immediately follow MP Rage , subject second 10-minute RSN scan ( 10-minutes post drug ) RSN instruction . After second RSN scan complete subject complete second Fullness Questionnaire ( FQ ) . This presented screen via goggles answer give scanner operator via intercom . The subject partially move scanner 1 teaspoon ( 5cc ) blood draw . This serum sample glucose , insulin exenatide pharmacokinetic . The subject move back scanner third final 10-minute RSN previous instruction . Immediately follow scan subject complete third FQ 1 teaspoon ( 5cc ) blood drawn glucose , insulin Exenatide pharmacokinetic level . After scan , subject take CTSI provide full balanced standard meal 1200 calorie . All subject 2 lunch meal choice choose ( chicken ham ) instruct `` eat full '' . After meal , subject complete fourth FQ final 5cc blood draw glucose , insulin Exenatide PK level . Approximate blood sample whole day 1-2 ounce . All scan do morning , ~9am-12pm , account hormonal fluctuation fast comfort subject . Visit 3 MRI scan Visit 2 : Visit 3 identical Visit 2 except subject receive opposite injection . If subject randomize receive 10ug Exenatide Visit 2 receive .5cc saline ( placebo ) Visit 3 . Otherwise study procedure identical .</detailed_description>
