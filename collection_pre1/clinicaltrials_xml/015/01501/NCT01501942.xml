	<detailed_description>This Phase II , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial evaluate efficacy AIM-102 treatment allergen-induced asthma . Individuals stable , mild moderate allergic asthma American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) criterion ( 1 ) , history episodic wheeze shortness breath , eligible enrollment . The study divide 2 part . Part 1 : Screening Patients meet entry criterion screen history , physical examination , spirometry , routine laboratory test . If continue meet entry criterion , atopic status document skin test common airborne allergen ( include cat , dust mite , grass , pollen ) . Twenty-four ( 24 ) hr later , allergen challenge perform confirm presence Early Asthmatic Response ( EAR ) Late Asthmatic Response ( LAR ) . Methacholine PC20 sputum differential perform allergen challenge . Only patient document early late asthmatic response inhale incremental allergen challenge eligible entry Part 2 study . Part 2 : Dosing Follow-up Patients assign receive drug placebo random order , least two week washout treatment period . Spirometry , vital sign , asthma symptomatology , methacholine challenge , sputum differential evaluate first dose 24 hr allergen challenge . Allergen challenge perform morning Day 3 dosing , post-dose , spirometry measure seven hr post-challenge . Sputum also induce seven hr follow allergen challenge . Methacholine challenge sputum induction perform 24 hr allergen challenge . Any adverse event ( AEs ) asthma symptom evaluate clinic visit . A physical examination , vital sign , ECG , spirometry laboratory test repeat termination visit .</detailed_description>
