	<brief_summary>The Multiway stimulator novel TMS stimulator several new unique property . Currently standard TMS device include single channel , operate single coil . The Multiway stimulator include five channel operate five independent TMS coil , either simultaneously sequentially . The Multiway device may use obtain differential activation various brain region . For instance use induce high frequency stimulation certain brain region , thus induce facilitation , simultaneously stimulate low frequency another brain region , lead inhibition . The purpose study explore efficacy safety Multiway deep TMS comparison single channel DTMS treatment subject MDD . Subjects treat one two design study device ( Multiway Coil TMS Device ) : 1 . Single Channel coil place leave PFC ( 10 Hz ) . 2 . Four channel : . 10 Hz leave PFC . b . 1 Hz right PFC . c. 10 Hz leave parietal cortex . d. 1 Hz right parietal cortex .</brief_summary>
