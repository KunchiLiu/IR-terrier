	<detailed_description>Acute chest syndrome severe complication sickle cell disease . Several factor contribute complication include infection , vaso-occlusive crisis , important pain may give shortness breath morphinic treatment may cause hypoventilation . The standard prevention dangerous complication incentive spirometry wich patient require take deep breath trough little device several time day . This treatment compromise pain important patient asleep participate . In patient surgery also pain morphinic treatment , non invasive ventilation proven good option prevent pulmonary complication . Besides , experience non invasive ventilation treatment acute chest syndrome show good tolerance efficiency . It also seem help pain management . The investigator hypothesise non invasive ventilation wich patient effort take might better prevention incentive spirometry may improve pain quality sleep . After informed consent , patient age 6 20 year old SS S-Beta sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crisis necessitate morphinic treatment hospitalise intensive care unit Necker Hospital Sick Children ( Paris ) randomly assign either spirometry ventilation . It monocentric study . Patients acute chest syndrome , oxygen need , pneumonia condition require ventilation presentation include . Spirometry realise volumetric device , every two hour day 10 maximum inspiration night patient awake . Non invasive ventilation apply nasal mask VS III machine ResmedÂ® , least one hour every four hour may maintain patient chooses asleep machine . The investigator monitor occurrence acute chest syndrome , pain , morphinic requirement , length hospital stay , comfort , quality sleep The treatment continue morphinic treatment stop . The investigator intend include 60 patient arm show difference 25 % occurrence acute chest syndrome ( primary judgement criterion ) . Acute chest syndrome define accord criterion use Vichinsky ( Vichinsky , E. P. et al . Acute chest syndrome sickle cell disease : clinical presentation course . Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease . Blood 89 , 1787-1792 ( 1997 ) The investigator aslo compare morphinic requirement , length hospital stay quality sleep secondary judgment criterion .</detailed_description>
