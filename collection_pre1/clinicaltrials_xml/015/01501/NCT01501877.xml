	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Intervention Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals Type 2 diabetes smoke rate similar find general population , health consequence smoke particularly severe among smoker diabetes . In fact , appear synergistic effect smoking diabetes mortality . However , despite report highlight importance work , paucity study conduct develop test smoking cessation intervention tailor meet need individual diabetes . The small number extant study yield mixed result . Distress tolerance ( DT ) focus , acceptance-based intervention demonstrate efficacy smoking cessation , increase support conceptual model underlying intervention among individual diabetes . The long-term objective research program improve smoke cessation treatment individual Type 2 diabetes develop establish efficacy DT smoking cessation intervention tailor population . Furthermore , seek advance knowledge relationship among nicotine withdrawal , negative affect , distress tolerance , smoke cessation outcome among individual diabetes . In present study , develop DT intervention tailor meet needs smoker Type 2 diabetes . In first phase project , develop pilot intervention 18 patient . In second phase project , conduct preliminary , randomized trial 54 patient examine efficacy DT intervention relative standard smoke cessation treatment ( ST ) equate therapist contact time . Patients condition receive transdermal nicotine patch . We expect , relative ST condition , patient randomize DT condition increase likelihood smoking abstinence increase latency smoking lapse relapse . If efficacy intervention establish trial subsequent large scale randomize controlled trial , smoker diabetes improved smoking cessation treatment option . The need work great give paucity extant work area , significantly heighten risk morbidity mortality smoking among diabetic patient , rapidly increase rate diabetes U.S. , apparent stabilization smoking rate recent year .</detailed_description>
