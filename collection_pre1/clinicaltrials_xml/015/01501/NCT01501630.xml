	<brief_title>Role PET/CT With Fluorine-18 Tracers Bone Metastases Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient high risk prostate cancer high PSA level , PET/CT fluoride ( 18F ) FLUOROCHOLINE ( 18F ) whole-body MRI perform within one month . Data 6 month follow-up examination make available panel independent expert . They determine standard truth ( SOT ) concern invasion skeleton also soft tissue prostate cancer tissue , impact image modality patient management adequacy decision . In case ( anti-hormone treatment without histology ) , possible determine SOT . By comparison result blind reading image modality standard truth , diagnostic performance determine . By simulation , several strategy construct concern best examination perform sequence accord precise clinical circumstance . Their cost effectiveness evaluate .</detailed_description>
