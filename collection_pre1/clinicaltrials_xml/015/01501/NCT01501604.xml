	<brief_summary>In people whos cancer PIK3CA mutation , trial evaluate drug BKM120 possible treatment . BKM120 work block phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , thereby inhibit tumor growth survival . The purpose study learn study drug BKM120 shrink slow growth tumor . The safety BKM120 also study . Your physical state , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain study help research team decide BKM120 safe effective patient advance cancer .</brief_summary>
