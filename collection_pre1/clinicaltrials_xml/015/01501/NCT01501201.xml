	<brief_title>Comparison Gastric By-Pass Optimized Medical Treatment Obese Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimizing management type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) remain major public health concern decade come . T2DM already affect 4 % French population generates year 12 billion euro expenditure . By combine therapy , oral and/or injectable ( insulin analogue GLP-1 ) , current management T2DM provide two third patient satisfactory metabolic control ( HbA1c &lt; 7 % ) reduce incidence cardiovascular complication . Its effect mortality , however , remain limited , presumably persistence cardiovascular risk factor . A recent study confirm French patient T2DM present overall mortality risk significantly high general population . In France , group register mortality 32 death per 1000 person . Bariatric surgery recognize method treatment severe obesity . It allow permanent loss least 50 % initial excess weight . In obese patient , surgery also associate significant reduction cardiovascular risk factor particularly T2D . A recent meta-analysis retrospective study available suggests surgery result remission T2DM 75 % case . The prospective randomized study show gastric restriction place gastric band , provide good glycemic control medical treatment obese patient recently discover T2DM . The gastric by-pass ( GBP ) also include intestinal by-pass , seem even high metabolic efficiency gastric bypass alone . In patient T2DM , GBP restore postprandial insulin secretion independently weight loss . Despite significant morbidity intervention , long-term result seem broadly supportive GBP . In large case-control study , GBP associate decrease 90 % death relate diabetes . In controlled study conduct surgical candidate obese diabetic , GBP decrease overall world mortality 75 % 6 year . Despite encourage data , GBP propose small proportion ( &lt; 1 % ) patient likely benefit procedure .</detailed_description>
