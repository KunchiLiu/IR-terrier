	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The total effect medication sum drug effect , placebo effect ( mean response placebo ) , possible interaction . Current interpretation result clinical trial ( gold standard evidence base medicine ) assume interaction . Using novel cross-over balance placebo design caffeine model drug recently show negative interaction exist ; suggest size drug effect currently measure clinical trial may accurate . Due novelty finding important clinical practice research implication , need confirm use another drug ; size drug effect measure use novel design need directly compare measure use conventional clinical trial design . DESIGN : A cross-over balance placebo plus randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial design . METHODS : 480 adult double-blindly randomize three group : first generation H-1 receptor antagonist- hydroxyzine ( 25 mg ) , placebo , hydroxyzine+placebo group . The first two group receive assign intervention describe investigator hydroxyzine placebo , randomize crossover design . The third group receive hydroxyzine placebo randomize double-blind placebo-controled crossover design . Group assignment conceal volunteer recruiter . Data collector blind group assignment intervention assignment . Volunteers partially deceive intervention assignment first two group blind third group . The intervention third group also administer blindly . Serum hydroxyzine level determine 3 hour post intervention volunteer verify compliance help maintain deception/blinding . The result study expect understanding widely use medical intervention , i.e. , placebo , help ass appropriateness randomize clinical trial determine size drug effect .</detailed_description>
