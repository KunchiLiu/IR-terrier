	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two dos Quizartinib patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia also FMS-like tyrosine kinase - internal tandem duplication ( FLT3-ITD ) positive . Patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio one two treatment arm . Both treatment arm receive Quizartinib different dos . The study treatment take orally 28 day cycle either disease progression occur unacceptable toxicity occur . In addition study assessment evaluate disease , blood drawn measure drug level biomarkers . Patients follow survival three month interval end treatment .</brief_summary>
