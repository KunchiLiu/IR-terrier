	<brief_summary>Study GEICAM 2011-02 multicenter , open label , non-randomized phase 2 trial evaluate efficacy safety nab-paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment ER positive HER2 negative patient amenable receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The primary objetive trial determine percentage patient poor response [ residual cancer burden III ( RCB-III ) rate ] contrast good response [ residual cancer burden 0/I RCB-0/1 ] measure Symmans criterion [ 20 ] surgery , patient stage II-III luminal breast cancer treat neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel . The primary endpoint study determine residual cancer burden grade III ( RCB-III ) surgery . The total number patient include study 78 patient . The duration study , first patient visit last patient visit approximately 90 month ( Including follow-up )</brief_summary>
