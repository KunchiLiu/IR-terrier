	<brief_summary>Patients able eat normally long time require parenteral nutrition , i.e . receive liquid nutrient directly vein . This many long-term side effect , include liver problem . This study examine whether specific lipid emulsion contain fish oil improve liver disease patient parenteral nutrition . The investigator compare change bilirubin liver enzymes 3 month 10 patient receive standard lipid emulsion 10 patient receive standard lipid + fish-oil containing emulsion . The investigator also assess liver histology , kind fat , oxidative stress gene expression liver begin 6 month fish-oil . The investigator also want compare baseline value 20 patient 20 healthy control . This help explain fish oil may improve liver disease patient parenteral nutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil Patients With Liver Disease Due Parenteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic exposure total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) cause parenteral nutrition associate liver disease ( PNALD ) , progressive condition may severely affect liver lead end-stage liver disease . Fish oil show exert beneficial effect favorably alters metabolism inflammation . It use parenterally ( Omegaven ) young child short bowel syndrome PNALD encouraging result . In adult mostly use peri-surgical setting well critically ill patient , prove effectiveness . The goal proposal show Omegaven use home-TPN patient PNALD elevate bilirubin despite conventional treatment , beneficial improve cholestasis reduce intrahepatic inflammation . Primary objective compare response treatment Omegaven Intralipid group . Secondary objective study effect Omegaven supplementation single liver function test , liver histology , liver fatty acid composition , liver oxidative stress gene expression . In addition , investigator want compare baseline value 20 patient 20 healthy control subject . After establish patient ' liver disease improve conventional medical treatment 3 month , evidence repeat blood work time , liver biopsy do per diagnostic standard . They randomize either continue receive Intralipid ( 0.25 g/kg/TPN day ) mixture Intralipid ( 0.25 g/kg/TPN day ) Omegaven ( 0.4 g/kg/TPN day ) period 3 month . After , patient Omegaven arm continue treatment 3 month . Those Intralipid arm switch also receive Omegaven follow 6 month . Blood work repeat every 3 month initiation intervention . A repeat liver biopsy do group 6 month . Main outcome response treatment ( improvement liver function test ) 3 month ( compare Intralipid Omegaven ) . In addition , change liver function test 6 month Omegaven assess . Lipid peroxidation oxidative stress , fatty acid composition , gene expression liver compare 6 month Omegaven . In second part study baseline value 20 patient compare 20 healthy control . Controls recruit healthy living liver donor transplant program University Health Network ( UHN ) . Liver sample obtain time hepatectomy transplantation . The measurement patient liver perform healthy liver tissue . Significance : The investigator aim reveal beneficial effect fish oil supplementation set PNALD . Should pilot study show improvement liver disease Omegaven , large , randomized trial follow . Comparison healthy control provide insight pathogenesis PNALD , date completely understand</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically stable patient home TPN PNALD persistently elevate bilirubin ( &gt; 1.5 time &gt; normal ) least 3 month despite standard treatment ursodeoxycholic acid ( 1530 mg/kg least 500 mg/d orally ) , change TPN ( reduction 25 kcal/kg/TPN day Intralipid 0.25 g/kg ) , antibiotic ( Metronidazole 500 mg bid Ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid ) male female , equal 18 year age stable TPN regimen equal 3 days/week stable drug regimen equal 3 month prior randomization , change study duration drug ursodeoxycholic acid give PNALD others affect glucose lipid metabolism Not receive lipid emulsion part TPN Allergy fish , egg , soy , peanuts Liver disease etiology ( e.g . excessive alcohol intake &gt; 20g/d , viral hepatitis , autoimmune druginduced , hemochromatosis , alfa 1antitrypsin deficiency , Wilson 's disease ) Complications chronic liver disease , recurrent variceal bleeding , ascites , encephalopathy reason contraindicate liver biopsy Severe hemorrhagic disorder Sepsis Inflammatory process Taking medication precipitate steatohepatitis ( e.g . corticosteroid , methotrexate , amiodarone ) Pregnancy , lactation Fluid restriction Omegaven dilute Intralipid .</criteria>
