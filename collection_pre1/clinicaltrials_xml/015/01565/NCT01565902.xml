	<criteria>All subject : Male female Caucasian subject 18 70 year age At least 50 kg body mass index ( BMI ) within 1835 kg/m2 . CYP2C9 wildtype ( CYP2C9*1 homozygous carrier ) Hepatic impairment : Subjects must either mild , moderate severe hepatic impairment All subject Hepatic impairment due nonliver disease . Use investigational drug within certain timeline Donation loss 400 mL blood plasma within eight ( 8 ) week prior initial dose History cardiac rhythm abnormality cardiac rhythm abnormality identify 24h Holter ECG record include episode bradycardia ( HR &lt; 50 bpm ) waking hour and/or arrhythmic episode ; subject history presence ventricular rhythm disturbance ( ventricular extrasystole &gt; 100/24h , high grade ) , supraventricular arrhythmia ( occasional supraventricular ectopic beat maximum 5 subsequent ectopic beat per event ) subject conduction disturbance ( high AVblock grade 1 ) bradycardia tachycardia . History cardiac catheter ablation . Women childbearing potential History malignancy organ system Recent and/or recurrent history acute chronic bronchospastic disease ( include asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) History presence symptomatic postural hypotension syncope . Total WBC lymphocyte count fall outside 1.5fold local laboratory normal range platelet count &lt; 30,000/Î¼L screen baseline . Clinically significant infection recent vaccination liveattenuated vaccine . History presence hepatitis B C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Hepatitis C test result screen . History presence coronary heart disease ( stable unstable ) , myocardial infarction , myocarditis , cardiomyopathy , heart failure NYHA II IV . Hepatic impairment : History presence noncontrolled clinically significant disease could affect study outcome would place patient undue risk . Any surgical medical condition hepatic impairment might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , may jeopardize safety study subject case participation study . Treatment certain drug Healthy subject : History presence clinically significant disease major system organ class include ( limited ) cardiovascular , metabolic , renal , neurological psychiatric disease . Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , drug , may jeopardize subject case participation study .</criteria>
