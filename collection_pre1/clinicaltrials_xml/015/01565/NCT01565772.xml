	<brief_summary>This research study look alternative way deliver radiation therapy proton . Protons tiny particle positive charge control travel certain distance stop inside body . In theory , allow good control radiation dose deliver compare photon . Information research study suggest proton radiation may help reduce unwanted side effect radiation allow increase radiation dose increase odds tumor kill . The purpose study determine safest dose proton radiation therapy give combination standard chemotherapy participant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Radiation Therapy With Cisplatin Etoposide Followed Surgery Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton radiation deliver daily Monday Friday 5 week . Study therapy give outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Center Massachusetts General Hospital . During week subject receive radiation , also receive 2 cycle chemotherapy . Each cycle last 28 day . Cisplatin give IV infusion 30-60 minute 1-2 hour Days 1 8 Cycles 1 2 . Etoposide give IV infusion 60 minute Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 Cycles 1 2 . After radiation 2 cycle chemotherapy complete , subject may surgery remove tumor . Following surgery , subject may receive another 2 cycle chemotherapy ( Cycles 3 4 ) . Each cycle last 21 day . Cisplatin give Day 1 . Etoposide give Days 1 , 2 , 3 .</detailed_description>
