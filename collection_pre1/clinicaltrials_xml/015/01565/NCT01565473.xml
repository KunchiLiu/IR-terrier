	<brief_summary>This research plan focus neurochemical positron emission tomography ( PET ) study Parkinson disease ( PD ) . PD common neurodegenerative movement disorder , considerable progress make understand treat `` typical '' movement abnormality rest tremor , bradykinesia rigidity . These cardinal PD feature initially responsive dopamine replacement therapy , investigate intensively respect relationship degeneration nigrostriatal dopamine projection . More recently , increase attention focus `` non-motor '' clinical aspect PD , include cognitive , mood , chronobiological peripheral autonomic defect . These clinical feature less reliably affected dopaminergic therapy , likely associate , non-dopaminergic neural degeneration . Indeed , detailed postmortem assessment PD brain reveal substantial neuronal loss variety chemically-defined neuron , include brainstem serotonin norepinephrine neuron basal forebrain cholinergic neuron . Projects proposal focus dementia , depression , sleep-apnea dysautonomia PD patient , employ PET measure presynaptic dopaminergic , serotoninergic cholinergic CNS neuron peripheral sympathetic neuron . Results investigation may identify association non-motor PD sign symptoms non-dopaminergic neuronal loss . These finding establish additional therapeutic target symptomatic , also potential neuroprotective PD therapy . In addition , majority patient characterize 3 CNS PET measure . The availability multiple marker distinct neuronal population involve PD neurodegeneration permit exploratory analyse ass whether degeneration correlate ( possibly manifestation common pathophysiology ) apparently independent ( possibly manifestation multiple PD subtypes pathophysiologies ) . Ultimately , good understand non-motor feature essential develop future treatment address entire PD patient .</brief_summary>
