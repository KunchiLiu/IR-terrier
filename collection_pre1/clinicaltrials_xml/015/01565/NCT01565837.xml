	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate precisely-targeted radiation therapy , know stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SART ) , give treatment drug ipilimumab ( Yervoy ) improve survival patient melanoma spread five few site ( oligometastatic ) . Blood sample collect research purpose . Planned study include exploration certain gene mutation serum marker predictor response ipilimumab treatment . Research lab study also evaluate circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) accurately detect isolated blood use novel laboratory technique prognostic/predictive marker treatment response . Test result give participant physician . In case , CTC may grow long-term cell line research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Ipilimumab Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy ( SART ) Oligometastatic But Unresectable Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness concurrent ipilimumab therapy SART melanoma base 1-year 2-year overall survival . 2 . To evaluate safety tolerability concurrent ipilimumab therapy SART melanoma base CTCAE grade toxicity , identify novel unexpected Grade 3 4 toxicity think specifically related ipilimumab concurrent SART first 3 cycle ipilimumab therapy ( prior week 9 ) Phase II study . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate 1-year 2-year disease control rate ( CR+PR+SD ) 2 . Assess treatment response base Immune Related Response Criteria ( irRC ) mWHO criterion . 3 . Characterize overall survival Kaplan-Meier analysis . Exploratory Objectives : 1 . Evaluate individual lesion control ( &lt; 25 % progression ) follow body SART 6 , 12 , 24 month . 2 . Describe number patient require retreatment local lesion surgery treatment . 3 . Describe incidence new brain metastasis follow ipilimumab therapy . 4 . Describe incidence treatment related toxicity and/or symptomatic bleeding , perforation , necrosis SART treat tumor site . 5 . Explore use circulate melanoma cell serum metastasis gene expression level prognostic predictive ( intermediate ) marker identify respond patient . 6 . Assess effect therapy quality life , use ECOG score surrogate . Study Rationale : Ipilimumab may markedly enhance immunologic response tumor antigen release necrotic tumor cell radiotherapy promote cytotoxic T cell activation , prevent induction antigen tolerance . In addition , beneficial immunologic effect may achieve reduction amount viable tumor cell mass . The net effect may promote significantly enhance antitumor T cell response . This result improve 1-year 2-year survival , especially minimal microscopic disease state achieve within patient follow SART . Biologic Correlation Studies : There currently standard prognostic predictive marker evaluate predict outcome ipilimumab therapy . This study provide opportunity exploratory analysis several candidate hypothesis may predict outcome .</detailed_description>

Autoimmune disease ( vitiligo basis exclusion ) . History clinically active diverticulitis ( diverticulosis exclusion criterion per se ) . Serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impede treatment . Underlying medical psychiatric condition would cause administration ipilimumab hazardous , would obscure interpretation AEs . Any nononcology vaccine therapy 1 month dose ipilimumab . Concomitant therapy IL2 , interferon , nonstudy immunotherapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunesuppressive agent within 30 day registration ; investigational therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ( however , low stable dose steroid mild brain edema adrenal insufficiency allow ; topical inhaled standard dose corticosteroid allow ) . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance protocol requirement . Pregnant breastfeed woman .
