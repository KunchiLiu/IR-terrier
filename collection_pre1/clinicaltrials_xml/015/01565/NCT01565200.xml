	<brief_summary>T-DM1 , highly innovative also expensive antiHER2 agent consist couple humanise monoclonal antibody trastuzumab cytotoxic agent ( maytansine derivate ) show encouraging antitumor activity evaluate Recist criterion ( 35 % objective response rate , 44 % stable disease , 18 % progressive disease ) patient advance HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated several cytotoxic drug , trastuzumab lapatinib . Rationale I : For TDM1 active , presence intact HER2 receptor `` key '' since internalization cytotoxic moiety depend bind trastuzumab external domain HER2 . The zirconium 89 label trastuzumab PET/CT ( HER2 immunoPET/CT ) non invasive test show promise measure HER2 expression ( extracellular domain ) entire disease burden could identify non respond patient prior TDM1 administration . Rationale II : As many agent , desirable identify early ( use FDG-PET/CT ) patient unlikely benefit therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective trial prospectively evaluate ability zirconium 89 label trastuzumab PET , predict , initiation treatment , treatment failure new target drug : T-DM1 . At time , early FDG-PET/CT , perform 1 course T-DM1 , also evaluate ability predict non response TDM1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must histologically confirm HER2 positive invasive carcinoma breast reference laboratory participate center . HER2 positive criterion apply used participate country : Belgium : FISH amplification ratio ≥ 2 reference laboratory participate center The Netherlands : IHC 3+ FISH ratio ≥ 2 reference laboratory participate center 2 . The patient must document progressive disease present least 2 nonbone `` target '' metastatic lesion , unequivocally neoplastic origin transaxial diameter great 2 cm screen diagnostic CT/MRI nonbone lesion except lymphnodes short axis great 1,5 cm lymphnodes screen diagnostic CT/MRI These two lesion confluent adjacent lesion irradiate previously . 3 . A concurrent biopsy metastatic site mandatory ( two formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) core sample two snap frozen tumor sample ) progression document inclusion patient agree procedure . 4 . Primary tumor block ( 11 unstained slide ) available confirmatory central laboratory HER2 test Institut Jules Bordet . If available , snap frozen sample primary tumor also centralize Institut Jules Bordet . 5 . Age ≥ 18 year 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 7 . No significant cardiac history current LVEF ≥ 50 % 8 . Adequate organ function , evidence follow laboratory result : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless patient document Gilbert 's syndrome . Patients know Gilbert 's Syndrome direct bilirubin within normal limit . Serum alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Patients bone metastasis : alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL 177 μmol/L International normalize ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT PTT ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( unless therapeutic anticoagulation except vitamin K antagonists prohibit study ) 9 . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial . 10 . For woman childbearing potential serum pregnancy test do ( must negative ) agreement use highlyeffective form contraception study least follow 7 month obtain . 11 . Signed write informed consent obtain prior study specific procedure . 12 . Completion necessary baseline surgical , laboratory imaging investigation prior patient inclusion . 1 . Patients bone metastasis eligible . 2 . Diffuse liver ( ≥50 % ) involvement image . 3 . Patients brain metastasis sole site metastatic disease and/or symptomatic require therapy control symptom NB : Brain metastasis allow provide asymptomatic and/or control previous radiotherapy . In case recent prior brain radiotherapy , must evidence MRI image brain metastatic control least 6 week since end radiotherapy . Moreover , patient end corticosteroid therapy clinically asymptomatic . 4 . Current uncontrolled hypertension despite medication intake ( systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ) 5 . Current unstable angina 6 . History symptomatic CHF New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) criteria ventricular arrhythmia require treatment 7 . History myocardial infarction within last 6 month 8 . History decrease LVEF &lt; 40 % symptomatic CHF previous trastuzumab treatment 9 . Current dyspnea rest due complication advance malignancy , diseases require continuous oxygen therapy 10 . Current severe , uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , metabolic disease ; wound heal disorder ; ulcer ; bone fracture ) 11 . History malignancy within last 5 year , except appropriately treat carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin carcinoma , Stage I uterine cancer , cancer similar outcome previously mention 12 .
