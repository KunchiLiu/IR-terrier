	<brief_summary>Psychiatric disorder often result dysregulation cellular molecular mechanism level brain . Unable directly study brain tissue patient affect psychiatric condition , researcher create alternative experimental model use different easy collect tissue . The underlie assumption study `` proxy '' tissue , possible obtain information biological mechanism good approximation would detect brain . One establish experimental model lymphoblastoid cell line derive B-lymphocytes . Lymphocytes present peripheral blood easily collect store virtually forever undergoing special laboratory procedure immortalize . These cell line prove useful genetic pharmacogenetic research , use , investigator want investigate cellular effect mood stabilize drug call lithium specific procedure make virtually immortal . Two main reason lead u study drug : 1 ) effective treatment bipolar disorder , approximately 30 % patient achieve complete illness remission prevention episode recurrence ; 2 ) well establish regulatory effect expression specific target gene protein . The investigator take advantage well-established property lithium regulate expression gene , protein , enzyme stable manner . Conversely , biological measure could use marker effect lithium gene expression . The purpose study learn change activity gene cell sample healthy individual treat lithium . By study cellular change , investigator hope understand lymphoblastoid cell line valid tool psychiatric genetics research . Specifically , investigator want see specially treat lymphoblastoid cell line influence external condition specifically lithium treatment moment sample . To , investigator measure gene expression ( i.e . much gene cell ) lymphoblastoid cell line compare level sample one month lithium treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background One major limitation psychiatric research necessity use indirect method study neuronal function . Among , study transform lymphocyte invaluable tool . Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) transform lymphoblast use variety purpose include vitro study gene expression investigation cellular response pharmacological treatment . They keep re-grown need often serve backup supply DNA genetic analysis . For reason , lymphoblast cell line ( LCLs ) collect used number research group , include . Most investigator work implicit assumption transform cell represent trait characteristic person illness . In word , cell transformation repeat passage assume reduce impact confound factor present time blood sample lymphocyte isolation . These factor may include , among others , clinical state , actual treatment , time day . Surprisingly , could find publish data support contradict assumption . Here propose investigate effect one particular factor may influence various cellular measure , namely vivo drug treatment . Specifically , interested assess effect treatment lithium , ion posse mood-stabilizing property . Indeed , lithium effective treatment bipolar disorder , approximately 30 % patient achieve complete illness remission prevention episode recurrence ( Baldessarini Tondo , 2000 ; Garnham et al. , 2007 ) . Rationale Lithium well establish regulatory effect expression specific target gene . Gene expression study LCLs patient characterize response lithium treatment identify series molecular target directly modulate drug . A microarray study ( Sun et al. , 2004 ) LCLs patient BD characterize full response lithium demonstrate effect decrease expression seven gene : somatostatin receptor type 2 ( SSTR2 ) , nuclear factor kappa-B DNA binding subunit ( NF-kB ) , alpha1B-adrenoceptor ( 1B-AR ) , acetylcholine receptor protein alpha chain precursor ( ACHR ) , cAMP-dependent 3 ' , 5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D ( PDE4D ) , substance-P receptor ( SPR ) , ras-related protein ( RAB7 ) , latter five validated Northern blotting analysis . Recently , use LCLs three healthy subject , Sugawara coworkers ( 2010 ) identify 44 gene whose expression regulate lithium . Among ten gene down-regulated lithium Bax , zuotin relate factor 1 ( ZRF1 ) thioredoxin domain contain 13 ( TXNDC13 ) , platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase , isoform Ib , beta subunit 30 kDa ( PAFAH1B2 ) , Synovial sarcoma translocation , chromosome 18 ( SS18 ) peroxisome biogenesis factor 1 ( PEX1 ) up-regulated . Moreover , Washizuka et al . ( 2009 ) show valproate , lithium , significantly increase expression gene encode subunit mitochondrial complex I ( NDUFV2 ) LCLs Japanese BD patient . In regard psychiatric phenotype , unpublished data LCLs BD patient characterize different risk suicidal behaviour show vitro lithium treatment significantly perturb expression gene cod rate limit enzyme spermidine/spermine N ( 1 ) -acethyltransferase ( SAT1 ) ( Squassina et al. , preparation ) . Besides gene expression study , LCLs also use investigate effect lithium protein level BD subject . The study Tseng et al . ( 2008 ) reveal basal BDNF protein level decrease LCLs lithium responsive BD patient compare unaffected relative healthy control participant . Interestingly , vitro treatment lithium LCLs decrease BDNF level participant , difference BD patient healthy control remain . In addition , pleiotropic effect lithium gene protein expression deeply investigated series study use animal ( Bosetti et al. , 2002 ; McQuillin et al. , 2007 ; Chetcuti et al. , 2008 ; Chen et al. , 1999 ) human ( Sun et al. , 2007 ; Seelan et al. , 2008 ) cell tissue . Specifically : 1 ) Lithium show increase expression anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 reduction expression pro-apoptotic gene p53 Bax ( Chen et al. , 1999 ) clearly indicate role influence molecular cascade regulating program cell death . This evidence acquire particularly interest light recent finding BCL2 . Two recent study ( Machado-Vieira et al. , 2011 , Uemura et al. , 2011 ) demonstrate , individual BD , BCL2 gene expression regulate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs956572 directly impact intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis dysregulation , molecular signal pathway prove play significant role pathogenesis BD . 2 ) Using genome wide gene expression approach ( GWGE ) multiple prostate human cancer cell line incubate lithium , Sun coworkers 11 show mark downregulation gene involve DNA replication . In another study , Seelan et al . ( 2008 ) , attempt profile lithium-modulated gene expression human neuronal cell microarray , identify peroxiredoxin 2 ( PRDX2 ) , antioxidant enzyme , upregulated gene , tribbles homolog 3 ( TRB3 ) , pro apoptotic protein , downregulated , suggest role pathway mood stabilization process . In summary , lithium proven significantly modulate magnitude expression number gene , among robust replicate change BCL2 , BAX , p53 , SAT1 . Thus , take advantage well-established property lithium regulate expression gene , protein , significant stable manner . Conversely , gene could use marker effect lithium gene expression , provide measure investigation effectiveness EBV immortalization repeat passage eliminate vivo treatment effect . Trial Objectives This proposal aim validate assumption LCLs , via EBV immortalization repeat passage , influence environmental condition , especially drug treatment , time sample . To , fresh lymphocyte LCLs sample 20 healthy volunteer ( T0 ) ( T1 ) four week lithium treatment stable dose . First , set molecular study fresh lymphocyte examine expression level target gene ( namely BCL2 , BAX , p53 , SAT1 ) protein ( BDNF ) , activity Complex I ( biological measure already know up-/down- regulated lithium ) T0 T1 . These biological measure serve assay sensitivity . We expect regulate vivo lithium treatment consequently significantly different T0 T1 fresh lymphocyte . Only biological measure show significant difference fresh lymphocyte ( transform EBV ) analyze LCLs . Differential expression LCLs sample T0 T1 indicate EBV transformation repeat passage eliminate environmental influence , specifically , effect lithium treatment sample . Finally , study healthy volunteer , expect decrease confound factor give presence illness status .</detailed_description>
