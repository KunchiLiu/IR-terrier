	<brief_summary>There grow evidence high rate substance use disorder among individual psychotic disorder especially young people predisposition psychosis . There genetic evidence carrier valine158 allele catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene increase risk exhibit psychotic symptom develop schizophrenia use cannabis age 18 . It also show carrier COMT val/val genotype sensitive THC-induced psychotic experience conditional pre-existing susceptibility psychosis . The investigator propose use brain-imaging molecular genetics investigate whether genetic factor may contribute THC-induced dopamine release possibly cannabis- induced psychosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pharmaco-genetic Brain Mechanisms Associated With Cannabis- Induced Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genetic association study perform 100 young cannabis user ( age 18-26 year ) gene relate neurotransmitter dopamine ( D2 , DAT , COMT ) , GABA , glutamate cannabinoid receptor CB1 . Out cohort , 24 male subject without history cannabis drug-induced psychosis undergo brain imaging procedure order measure THC-induced dopamine release use [ 11C ] Raclopride PET image . Carriers high activity COMT158Val allele expect show higher meso-limbic DA release carrier low activity COMT 158Met homozygote smoke cigarette THC turn think underlie risk THC-induced psychotic symptom . The aim present study evaluate relationship COMT genotype cannabis-induced meso-limbic dopamine release measure D2 occupancy . In addition , association predisposition psychosis , age onset cannabis dependence , genotype COMT neurotransmitters-related gene evaluate . Such finding could provide novel pharmaco-genetic explanation psychogenic effect cannabis vulnerable individual .</detailed_description>
