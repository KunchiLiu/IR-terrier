	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES First endpoint : To assess effect high n-3 PUFA ( Omega 3 ) egg , compare regular- high n-6 PUFA ( Omega 6 ) Israeli egg , glycemic level night fast post prandial 2 egg breakfast test meal . Secondary endpoint : To compare effect high n-3 PUFA fortify egg versus high n-6 PUFA ( Regular ) egg measure associate CVD risk include : CRP , LDL oxidation , MDA , post prandial Flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) , liver enzymes , blood lipid lipoprotein , blood chemistry measure . Third endpoint : To assess influence n-3 Egg erythrocytes fatty acid profile . Study design : Prospective , Crossover , Compared Study Study population : 20 Healthy subject Study Methods : Subjects complete two study stage . In first stage study participant get 3 week regimen include 2 Regular , Israeli ( high n-6 Pufa ) eggs/day . In second stage 3 week washout without egg , study participant get 3 week regimen 2 high n-3Pufa eggs/day .</detailed_description>
