	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate medicine treatment symptom complication neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) child adolescent . NDO often occur patient spina bifida spinal cord damage bladder muscle contract normal filling . These patient often inability void , catheterization require empty bladder . The medicine test study call solifenacin succinate . Solifenacin tablet give adult treatment overactive bladder . A new liquid suspension develop treat child adolescent study . The efficacy safety solifenacin suspension investigate . The take-up length time solifenacin suspension stay body also investigate study . The study last approximately 12 month , complete patient receive 52 week continuous treatment . Effectiveness measure urodynamics ( fill empty bladder ) urine volume measure catheterization together diary response relate number incontinence episode incontinence free day . Safety assessment include analysis blood urine , review ECG , ultrasound kidney , simple memory understanding test ( cognitive function ) ability see near far object ( visual accommodation ) .</brief_summary>
