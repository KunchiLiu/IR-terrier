	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate difference use Ultrasonic Coagulation Device ( New Harmonic ACE™ , Ethicon endo-surgery ) Bipolar Energy Sealing System ( LigaSure Precise™ , Covidien ) surgery thyroid cancer . Abbreviations : Ultrasonic Coagulation Device ( UC ) , Bipolar Energy Sealing System ( BES ) , Recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) , Overall survival ( OS )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Ultrasonic Coagulation Device Bipolar Energy Sealing System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Thyroid organ abundant vessel . In thyroid surgery , cautious avoid injury recurrent laryngeal nerve parathyroid , thus careful hemostasis surgery crucial surgeon perform thyroid surgery . Recently , significant advance vessel seal system occlusion vessel surgery endoscopic surgery develop . UC BES commonly use thyroid surgery . However , study compare two surgical device determine technique superior term operative time complication rate . Thus , single-blind prospective randomize trial conduct determine difference operative time , complication rate , postoperative drainage volume , admission time , cost , , furthermore , oncologic outcome ( RFS OS ) two surgical device surgery thyroid cancer .</detailed_description>
