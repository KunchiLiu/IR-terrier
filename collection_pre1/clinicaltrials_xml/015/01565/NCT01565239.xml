STUDY SYNOPSIS Experiments suggest treatment vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) activity coagulation factor ( F ) II X well reflect anticoagulation FVII . Based new monitor prothrombin time base test ( Fiix-PT ) invent sensitive FII FX . The Fiix-PT convert INR ( `` Fiix-INR '' ) .We hypothesize Fiix-PT may reflect anticoagulation antithrombotic effect VKA accurately well current PT base test ( INR base PT P &amp; P ) . The protocol describe prospective randomize double-blind trial conduct Landspitali Anticoagulation Management Center ( AMC ) . The objective protocol evaluate efficacy safety Fiix-INR monitoring test compare current PT base assay ( INR ) use monitor patient treat VKA order prevent thromboembolism . We randomize 1200 client AMC two identically size monitoring group , Fiix-INR ( test group ) INR ( control group ) . Each individual assess monthly 24 month ( expect average 18 month ) total 600 patient year observation reach group . The clinical endpoint study include efficacy ( arterial venous thromboembolic event rate ) safety ( bleed event ) . Also , surrogate convenience endpoint study test frequency time within target range . 2 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 2.1 Background Vitamin K antagonist ( VKA , coumarins ) orally active anticoagulant prevent normal gamma carboxylation vitamin K dependent coagulation factor ( FII , FVII , FIX , FX ) . The consequence reduction clotability blood , ie anticoagulant effect use therapeutically purpose prevent thromboembolism . In order assure efficacy safety , dose VKA need adjust maintain normalized prothrombin time ratio ( international normalize ratio , INR ) within safe therapeutic range ( often INR target 2.5 , range 2.0-3.0 ) . The clot time obtain PT base test practice 50 year presume directly reflect antithrombotic effect VKA patient ( Loeliger 1984 ) . The PT ( P &amp; P-test ) use world purpose monitor anticoagulation make dose-adjustments patient take VKA . Their result standardize calculate International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) take account sensitivity ( strength ) thromboplastin use different reagent . However , inherent problem exist PT . Due VKD factors´ significantly different half-life ( ) , PT clot time obtain early initiation dose change may mainly reflect concentration factor VII since FVII notably shortest half-life ( 4-8 hour ) . If concentration factor VII little influence antithrombotic effect VKA ( see ) , possible unnecessary frequent dose adjustment make base use PT . This , could potentially harmful patient . Prior study others indicate thrombin generation ( Xi , Beguin et al . 1989 ; Brummel , Paradis et al . 2001 ) antithrombotic influence factor VII rabbit ( Zivelin , Rao et al . 1993 ) may less important prothrombin factor X . Based observation , possible monitoring VKA safety could improve measure either coagulation factor II coagulation factor X . Measuring monitor coagulation factor II alone ( native prothrombin antigen ) show successful accurate PT clinical study ( Furie , Liebman et al . 1984 ; Xi , Beguin et al . 1989 ; Furie , Diuguid et al . 1990 ; Kornberg , Francis et al . 1993 ) . The native prothrombin antigen assay , however , convenient laboratory PT P &amp; P . Monitoring coagulation factor X alone test patient knowledge . We investigate ( Thrombosis Research 2012 , press . ) influence VKD factor coagulation induce dilute ( trace amount ) thromboplastin use rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM ) . The dilute thromboplastin scientist consider reflect physiological clotting well 17,000 fold strong thromboplastin use current PT assay . ROTEM measure coagulation detail traditional clotting time , i.e . initiation phase ( clot time ) , propagation phase ( bulk clot formation ) stabilization phase . Taken together , experiment use ROTEM show ROTEM clotting time ( CT , initiation phase ) , ROTEM maximum velocity clot formation ( Max Vel , propagation phase ) ROTEM MCF ( stabilization phase ) affect much mildly moderately low concentration factor II X ( activity level present ideal anticoagulation ) identical FVII factor IX activity level . Factors VII IX mainly influence ROTEM parameter low concentration ( &lt; 5 % ) occur mark anticoagulation . We conclude experiment coagulation initiate trace amount thromboplastin ( physiological coagulation ) , reduction concentration coagulation factor II X much effect development clot concentration factor VII IX except extremely low activity level latter two factor . Our experimental result may indicate patient anticoagulated warfarin , factor VII activity confound source variation INR ( PT ) result . Hence , measure influence factor II X II X simultaneously fibrin formation might reduce INR fluctuation . Possibly , could better predict antithrombotic effect current test . Thus , measure II X simultaneously could possibly improve monitoring dose VKA therapy . This lead invention new test , `` Fiix-PT '' ( Stuart-Prothrombin time ) , measure combine action factor II factor X activity clot induced tissue thromboplastin PPP . We aware scientist investigate method local patent grant international patent application process ( March 2012 ) . The Fiix-PT affect reduced activity coagulation factor . In comparison , traditional test method ( Quick PT Owren´s PT ) measure combine effect factor II , VII X fibrin formation patient take VKA . 2.2 Hypothesis : Based experimental result well result others ( Xi , Beguin et al . 1989 ; Zivelin , Rao et al . 1993 ; Brummel , Paradis et al . 2001 ) , hypothesize Fiix-PT may reflect anticoagulation antithrombotic effect VKA least accurately current PT base test ( PT , P &amp; P ) . 3 . STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective study evaluate efficacy safety Fiix-INR monitoring test compare current PT base assay use monitor patient treat VKA prevent thromboembolism . 4 .

All data document make available requested 11 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 11.1 Statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) The plan describe following section . However , SAPs allow protocol amendment unexpected issue study execution data affect plan analysis . 11.2 Analysis population The intention-to-monitor ( `` ITM '' ) population consist patient randomize , i.e. , patient number allocate monitoring method record study-data base . Patients analyze monitor method assign . Patients contribute patient year time study For patient year analysis follow patient censor last day patient complete assessment study outcome within intend treatment duration . Patients thromboembolic bleed event time predefined randomized test duration , patient lose follow-up patient die reason thromboembolic event patient withdraw informed consent end predefined treatment duration efficacy safety outcome . The per-protocol-population ( PPP ) consist randomized patient without major deviation protocol . The following deviation lead exclusion PP population : Patients test accord allocation VKA treatment receive 11.3 Study population/sample size power/ demographic patient characteristic Baseline characteristic : Demographic characteristic ( include age , sex , indication anticoagulation , concomitant drug use ) summarize treatment group use descriptive statistic group compare regard baseline characteristic use traditional statistical method . As , major clinical event likely admit Landspitali , acute care hospital Reykjavik area , loss follow-up expect negligible . Therefore , adjustment sample size consider necessary . Patients exclude analysis population per protocol analysis list test method reason exclusion . The number percentage randomize patient discontinue study prematurely tabulate main reason discontinuation treatment group . 11.3.1 Non-inferiority margin estimation This study power analysis successful anticoagulation treatment monitoring . For calculation use data study clinical outcome patient mixed indication anticoagulation , monitor dose anticoagulation management center ( Palareti , Leali et al . 1996 ; Wilson , Wells et al . 2003 ; Abdelhafiz Wheeldon 2004 ; Menendez-Jandula , Souto et al . 2005 ) . In study combine endpoint major bleed thromboembolic event range 2.7 7.3 per 100 patient year event rate thromboembolic event 0.9 5.4 per 100 patient year ( 0.9-5.4 % ) low margin 95 % CI range form 2.9 8.2 % . The large observational study ( Palareti , Leali et al . 1996 ; Wilson , Wells et al . 2003 ; Abdelhafiz Wheeldon 2004 ; Menendez-Jandula , Souto et al . 2005 ) randomize study ( Palareti , Leali et al . 1996 ; Wilson , Wells et al . 2003 ; Abdelhafiz Wheeldon 2004 ; Menendez-Jandula , Souto et al . 2005 ) TE event rate 3.5 5.4 % respectively . We therefore chose use 3 % TE-event rate expect TE-event rate ( 97 % success rate ) non-inferiority 5.5 % ( 94.5 % success rate efficacy ) . We consider 2.5 % difference one clinically significant , yet within 95 % CI event rate prior study . Based consideration , appropriate number participant need demonstrate statistical non-inferiority clinically important event test method 80 % certainty one year observation 600 ( 576 ) patient group , i.e . 600 ( 576 ) patient year group . 11.4 Major event analysis ( Efficacy safety analysis ) Major event analysis , primarily TE event rate ( efficacy ) also secondary end point rate bleeding major bleeding ( safety ) well combine endpoint TE event major bleed event base ITT population . For primary secondary endpoint , event free survival compare two group use Kaplan-Meier curve . Optionally , time first event analyze use Cox 's proportional hazard model . 11.5 Interim analysis 11.5.1 Study monitor The study progress monitor continuously . Interim analysis safety purpose plan 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . Based , risk-benefit evaluate DSMB . 11.6 Surrogate endpoint analysis Median time within target range , time stable INR well surrogate parameter evaluate use Mann-Whitney test numeric row appropriate statistical test .</detailed_description>
