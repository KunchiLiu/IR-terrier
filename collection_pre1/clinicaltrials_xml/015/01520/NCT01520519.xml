	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) combine rituximab help control CLL SLL . The safety combination also study . Ibrutinib design stop protein work cell , may cause cancer cell die stop growing . Rituximab design attach cancer cell damage , may cause cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive rituximab vein Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 ( + 3 day ) Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycles 2-6 . Each cycle 28 day . You take Ibrutinib capsule mouth 1 time day start Day 2 Cycle 1 . You take 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You also take allopurinol mouth 1 time day first 1-2 week study treatment low risk side effect . Study Visits : On Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask drug may take . At end Cycles 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 ( +/- 1 month ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask drug may take . At end Cycles 3 6 , 12 ( +/- 1 month ) , every 12 cycle ( +/- 1 month ) doctor think need , CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis check status disease . At end Cycles 3 , 6 , 12 every 12 cycle ( +/- 1 month ) , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . If doctor thing bone marrow aspiration longer need , longer . Every 3 month ( +/- 1 month ) Cycles 13-36 every 6 month ( +/- 1 month ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask drug may take . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug combination rituximab Ibrutinib 6 cycle , Ibrutinib continue total 12 cycle . It possible continue Ibrutinib treatment beyond 12 cycle study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma , CLL SLL . Its use study investigational . Rituximab FDA approve treat CLL SLL . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
