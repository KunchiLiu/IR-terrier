	<detailed_description>Chronic pancreatitis progressive inflammatory disease pancreas characterize destruction pancreatic parenchyma subsequent fibrosis . The prevalence chronic pancreatitis find high southern India ( 114-200/100 000 population ) . Alcohol common etiology worldwide , idiopathic pancreatitis common type India China , account approximately 70 % case chronic pancreatitis . It cause considerable morbidity form pain , steatorrhea diabetes mellitus . Natural history chronic pancreatitis characterize variable course stretch decade recurrent acute pancreatitis early stage steatorrhea , diabetes pancreatic calcification later stage . Pain prominent clinical feature chronic pancreatitis troublesome symptom medical attention often seek . Unfortunately , despite much work , pathophysiology pain CP remain poorly understood . Multiple factor suspect , include inflammation , encasement sensory nerve fibrotic process neuropathy , duct obstruction , lead high back pressure parenchymal ischemia . Increased pressure main pancreatic duct likely important cause pain , particularly patient duct dilatation . This explanation form conceptual basis endoscopic surgical drainage procedure . Approximately one half patient pain owe chronic pancreatitis come intervention aim principally pain relief , along relief bile duct , duodenal , major venous obstruction . Patients chronic pancreatitis treat medical management , endoscopic therapy surgical treatment . For patient dilated duct , ductal decompression advocate . The pros con endoscopic versus surgical therapy debate . The modified Puestow lateral pancreaticojejunostomy commonly employ surgical procedure . Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy relieve chronic abdominal pain 65 % -93 % patient . Morbidity mortality rate generally low , average 20 % 2 % , respectively . Long-term follow-up patient lateral pancreaticojejunostomy reveals 50 % patient develop recurrent symptom 10 % -35 % fail obtain pain relief . Overall 60 % patient undergoing pancreatic endotherapy pain free 1 year procedure . There two randomize control trial compare endoscopic treatment surgical therapy . Dite et al . report first trial . Surgery consist resection ( 80 % ) drainage ( 20 % ) procedure , endotherapy include sphincterotomy stenting ( 52 % ) and/or stone removal ( 23 % ) . In entire group , initial success rate similar group , 5-year follow-up , complete absence pain frequent surgery ( 37 % vs. 14 % ) , rate partial relief similar ( 49 % vs. 51 % ) . In randomized subgroup , result similar ( pain absence 34 % surgery vs. 15 % endotherapy , relief 52 % surgery vs. 46 % endotherapy ) . The increase body weight also great 20 - 25 % surgical group , new-onset diabetes develop similar frequency group ( 34 - 43 % ) , difference result whole group randomize subgroup . The author conclude surgery superior endotherapy long-term pain reduction patient painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis . Cahen et al . report second trial . All symptomatic patient chronic pancreatitis distal obstruction pancreatic duct without inflammatory mass eligible study . Thirty-nine patient underwent randomization : 19 endoscopic treatment ( 16 underwent lithotripsy ) 20 operative pancreaticojejunostomy . During 24 month follow-up , patient underwent surgery , compare treat endoscopically , low Izbicki pain score ( 25 vs. 51 , P &lt; 0.001 ) good physical health summary score Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire ( P=0.003 ) . At end follow-up , complete partial pain relief achieve 32 % patient assign endoscopic drainage compare 75 % patient assigned surgical drainage ( P=0.007 ) . Rates complication , length hospital stay , change pancreatic function similar two treatment group , patient receive endoscopic treatment require procedure patient surgery group ( median eight vs. three , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Authors conclude surgical drainage pancreatic duct effective endoscopic treatment patient obstruction pancreatic duct due chronic pancreatitis . Both trial small sample size . The population study also different . ESWL include protocol one trial . In one trial pancreatic duct drainage choose surgical therapy . The propose study compare surgery endoscopic therapy Indian population chronic pancreatitis . The outcome compare would include pain relief , quality life , morbidity , mortality , length hospital stay change pancreatic endocrine exocrine function .</detailed_description>
