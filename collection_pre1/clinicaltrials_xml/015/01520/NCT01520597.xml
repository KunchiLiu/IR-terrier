	<detailed_description>Context : Listeriosis foodborne infection responsible severe disease . Surveillance human listeriosis France base mandatory reporting case voluntary submission L. monocytogenes strain National Reference Center Listeria ( NRC ) since 1999 . The exhaustiveness reporting estimate capture-recapture least 87 % . A recent consistent increase sporadic cluster-associated systemic listeriosis case report Europe since several year ( since 2006 France ) , remain poorly understood absence new environmental risk factor ( ) . A total 322 case report 2009 France . Three main clinical form identify : septicemia , central nervous system maternal-fetal infection . They characterize retrospective study pool heterogeneous patient . Such study provide accurate picture disease fail identify precise biological / genetic risk factor disease . Prognostic factor associate high risk death , severe neurological impairment fetal loss also remain determined . Main purpose : - study clinical , biological genetic risk factor systemic listeriosis identify determinant listeriosis-associated mortality set large prospective nation-wide study Secondary purpose : - determine clinical/biological radiological presentation listeriosis - describe study current therapeutic practice 3 form disease ( namely , septicaemic , neurologic maternal-fetal ) - identify inherited risk factor listeriosis Ancillary study : - evaluate serologic/PCR diagnostic tool Study design : National prospective multicenter study nest case control study . Clinical , biological radiological data collect . Additionally questionnaire focus dietary habit propose . A bank biological sample perform . For patient , 25ml heparinized blood / 2ml serum collect per patient</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Case : Patient cultureproven listeriosis ( blood , CSF , fetal/placental sample , other… ) . Control : Patient age 18 year medical background clinical feature compatible one 3 form systemic listeriosis : febrile pregnant woman ( temp &gt; 38°C ) , febrile patient comorbidity septicaemic listeriosis , febrile symptom lead empiric amoxicillin prescription . For feasibility reason , control include Paris ( France ) emergency ward . Case : Patient would refuse sign inform consent agreement Control : Patient would refuse sign inform consent agreement , whose sample would evidence L. monocytogenes</criteria>
