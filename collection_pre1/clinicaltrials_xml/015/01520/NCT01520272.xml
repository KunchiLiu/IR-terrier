A vaccine HPV offer 10-year-old girl Nakasongola district Uganda October 1 , 2008 , October 31 , 2009 . The HPV vaccine require three dos ; however , girl receive one two dos . Researchers want compare vaccine immunogenicity girl receive three dos one two dos . Objectives : - To examine immunogenicity ( antibody level ) girls Uganda receive one , two three dos HPV vaccine .

	<brief_title>HPV Vaccine Effectiveness Partially Vaccinated Girls Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Recent experience HPV vaccine implementation low resource setting suggest high vaccine coverage three dos could achieve provided program plan well full complementary component place . However , location experience substantial rate partially vaccinated girl , receive one two dos . From vaccine trial data publish thus far , know vaccine produce high level type-specific anti-HPV antibody begin stabilize past 24 month post-vaccination . Without immune correlate protection , difficult know whether girl receive one two vaccine dos still experience benefit protection HPV infection receive three dos vaccine . Recent data trial two-dose regimen vaccination girl age 9-13 year Vancouver , Canada suggest immune response girl receive two dos non-inferior girl receive 3 dos adult woman age 16-25 year also receive 3 dos . In complementary study Guanacaste , Costa Rica , vaccine efficacy ( define 12-month vaccine type-specific infection persistence ) among adult woman receive either one two dos HPV vaccine part Phase IIb clinical trial Cervarix ( GSK ) similar woman receive three vaccine dose . This propose study would provide additional insight immunogenicity HPV vaccine among partially vaccinate girl Uganda , could add supportive evidence African adolescent population ( currently represent clinical study HPV vaccine ) immunological implication receive less 3 dos HPV vaccine . Objective : To investigate whether anti-HPV 16 and/or anti-HPV-18 immune response elicit bivalent vaccine girl receive one dose receive two dos similar great equal 24 month ( last dose ) girl receive three dos bivalent HPV vaccine . Eligibility : Girls receive least one dose HPV vaccine , 12-20 year old , apparent good general health . Design : This cross-sectional immunogenicity study three group : Group 1 - 200 girl receive one dose HPV vaccine part PATH-UNEPI HPV vaccine demonstration project ; Group 2 - 200 girl receive two dos HPV vaccine part PATH-UNEPI HPV vaccine demonstration project ; Group 3 - 200 girl receive three dos HPV vaccine part PATH-UNEPI HPV vaccine demonstration project . This study enroll girl ( group ) within one district Uganda HPV vaccine registry maintain district . Antibody level parameterized geometric mean titre serum antibody HPV type 16 and/or 18 great equal 24 month last dose vaccine . Titres measure use polyclonal Direct VLP ELISA .</detailed_description>
