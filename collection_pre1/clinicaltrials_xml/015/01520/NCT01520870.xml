	<criteria>1 . Ability understand sign inform consent approve Ethic Committee . 2 . Men woman age great equal 18 . 3 . Patients grade IV malignant glioma accord WHO classification ( glioblastoma ) first relapse histologically confirm diagnosis central laboratory . Patients previous lowgrade glioma anaplastic glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma anaplastic oligodendroglioma ) , eligible , even histological assessment demonstrate transformation GBM . 4 . Patients first relapse ( progression ) chemoradiotherapy temozolomidebased chemotherapy ( Stupp4 scheme ) . 5 . All patient must EGFR gene amplification situ hybridization fluorescent ( FISH ) / EGFRvIII mutation PCR tumor sample make central laboratory ( Laboratory Neuropathology . Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre ) . 6 . For study cohort , patient must least 15 unstained slide block paraffinembedded tissue available previous biopsy surgery ( archived tumor sample previously ) . 7 . All patient must show progressive disease brain MRI define Criteria RANO . 8 . Interval least one week prior intracranial biopsy , heal properly , inclusion . 9 . Interval least 12 week prior radiotherapy inclusion , unless : ) histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor , b ) MR recurrence outside radiation field . 10 . Patients must recover previous therapy : 28 day completionof investigational drug / termination cytotoxic therapy . 11 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . 12 . Stable decrease dos corticosteroid five day prior inclusion study . 13 . Adequate bone marrow reserve , hematocrit great equal 29 % , WBC &gt; 3000 / mcl , ANC great equal 1,500 cell / ul , platelet great equal a100.000 cell / ul . 14 . Adequate hepatic function : bilirubin le equal 1.5 time ULN , AST ( SGOT ) less equal 2.5 x ULN . 15 . Creatinine within center ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level center ULN . 16 . The patient resection make first tumor recurrence eligible following case : There adequate recovery surgery . There must measurable evaluable disease surgery . For adequate Radiological evaluation residual disease , MRI must complete within 72 hour surgery 4 week surgery . 17 . The effect PF00299804 human foetal development unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use effective contraception ( hormonal control method , barrier , abstinence surgical sterilization ) inclusion study , participate study least 3 month treatment end trial . The definition effective contraceptive method base criterion principal investigator designee . In case woman become pregnant suspicion pregnant participating study , trial physician must inform immediately . All woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum / urine ) 2 week start treatment . NOTE : Patients receive treatment base scheme Stupp ( Chemoradiotherapy temozolomide follow temozolomide sequential ) eligible trial , even drug add scheme . It exclude , patient treat EGFR inhibitor obvious reason . However , patient receive Stupp scheme + drug like bevacizumab cilengitide , remain eligible . 1 . Presence extracranial metastatic disease . 2 . Concomitant treatment investigational drug . 3 . Prior treatment investigational drug/s know suspect active action component EGFR tyrosine kinase . 4 . Surgery kind ( include diagnostic procedure minor lymph node biopsy ) 2 week prior baseline assessment disease , presence side effect previous procedure . 5 . Presence clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality affect oral administration , transit absorption study drug , inability take medication mouth tablet . 6 . Presence psychiatric cognitive disorder limit understanding signature inform consent / jeopardize fulfillment requirement protocol . 7 . Significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease , include : Myocardial infarction within previous 12 month Uncontrolled angina within previos 6 month Congestive heart failure previous 6 month Known suspected congenital long QT syndrome History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia type ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation torsades de pointes ) QTc prolongation electrocardiogram prior entry ( &gt; 470 msec ) History second third grade heart block ( patient may eligible currently pacemaker ) Heart rate &lt; 50/minute baseline electrocardiogram Uncontrolled hypertension . 8 . Any patient history significant cardiovascular disease , even though currently control , present sign symptom suggestive impaired leave ventricular function discretion investigator , evaluation LVEF circumstance . If result center low limit normal low 50 % , patient would eligible . 9 . History cancer , except follow circumstance : Patients history malignancy eligible free disease least last 3 year , discretion investigator , low risk disease recurrence . Patients follow cancer eligible even diagnose treat last 3 year : carcinoma situ cervix basal cell basal cell skin carcinoma . Patients ineligible evidence neoplastic disease require therapy surgery past 3 year . 10 . Prior stereotactic radiotherapy brachytherapy . 11 . Intratumoral treatment CCNU recurrent tumor surgery ( second surgery ) . NOTE : Patients treat intratumoral CCNU ( ( intratumor carmustine GliadelÂ® ) , first intervention participate study . 12 . Presence leptomeningeal dissemination . 13 . Pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect PF00299804 unknown . Because unknown risk potential adverse effect infant , secondary maternal treatment PF00299804 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated PF00299804 . 14 . Patients positive HIV treat antiretroviral combination therapy . These patient eligible due potential pharmacokinetic interaction PF00299804 . Additionally , subject increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . HIVpositive patient antiretroviral combination therapy , eligible disease control discretion investigator . 15 . History allergic reaction attribute drug similar chemical biological composition PF00299804 . 16 . Another acute chronic serious medical condition , uncontrolled intercurrent illness laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation test result , investigator 's discretion , make patient inappropriate entry trial . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness / social situation limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
