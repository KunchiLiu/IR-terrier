	<detailed_description>Two cohort patient phenotype HIV resistance exist France . The ANRS CO15 ALT cohort set 1994 . 71 patient enrol defined immunological criterion : CD4 T cell count 600/mm3 stable increase count ( positive zero slope ) least three consecutive exam perform last 5 year whatever viral load , know HIV infection least 8 year . A consortium research team study immunovirological characteristic patient . After 16 year follow-up , 6 patient still actively follow . The main result show lack deletion viral gene functional viral defect , small size viral reservoir , distinctive genetic characteristic host ( HLA , chemokines ) lead potent immune cell response associate virus control . The ANRS CO18 HIV Controller cohort set 2009 stem French National Observatory HIV Controllers active 2006 2008 ( Study ANRS EP36 ) . 152 patient enrol defined virological criterion : last 5 plasmatic viral load 400 copies/mL without antiretroviral treatment , HIV-infected patient 5 year . A consortium research team study patient show Controllers infect replication-competent HIV , HIV infect CD4 T cell viral replication CD4 T cell fully control CD8 T cell . In addition , ANRS EP47 VISCONTI study identify 14 patient able maintain plasmatic viral load 400 copies/ml 7 year absence antiretroviral treatment . Differently HIV controller , naïve antiretroviral treatment , patient VISCONTI study start therapy within ten week primary infection keep median three year treatment discontinuation ( Post-Treatment Controllers PTC ) . The initial analysis reveal important clinical immunogenetic difference post-treatment natural controller , suggest PTC naturally predispose control infection succeed thanks initial therapeutic intervention . The mechanism associate long-term control post-treatment controller also appear different main mechanism identify HIV controller . The main objective gather common cohort patient particular resistance HIV infection , either immunological control ( ALT ) natural ( HIV Controllers ) induce virological control ( PTC ) . The enrolled patient patient already enrol cohort CO15 CO18 , ANRSEP47 VISCONTI study , new patient . This allow common physiopathological study precise mechanisms lead virus control CD4 homeostasy . A good knowledge mechanisms viral control immune response preservation important set vaccine perspective perspective implement new therapeutic intervention induce remission HIV infection . This cohort allow common research project common funding , good visibility clinician see patient unusual phenotypes international research . Such cohort unique world size presence three complementary group patient . The two main objective `` Extreme `` cohort ( ANRS CO21 CODEX ) clinical immunovirological . We wish precise impact prolong untreated HIV infection , describe frequency `` immunological escape '' ( CD4 T cell decrease ) `` virological escape '' ( permanent transient viral load increase ) , identify predictive marker HIV control . We wish study genetic characteristic patient virus , innate adaptative immune response direct HIV virus , consequence inflammation , characteristic loss control .</detailed_description>
