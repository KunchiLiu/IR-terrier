	<detailed_description>Invasive urothelial bladder cancer common malignancy cause 14,000 death annually United States . The primary objective feasibility/Phase I portion study establish feasibility safety proton safety IMRT . Safety base acute toxicity . The primary objective phase II study generate estimate local failure rate intermediate high risk patient treat either proton therapy IMRT . The study , however , explicitly design compare outcomes proton therapy IMRT . Secondary objective include evaluation acute late toxicity , quality life estimation overall survival .</detailed_description>
