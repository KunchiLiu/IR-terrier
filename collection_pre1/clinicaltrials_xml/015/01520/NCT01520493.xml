	<detailed_description>Pulmonary artery hypertension ( PAH ) rare , severe disease , characterize progressive increase pulmonary vascular resistance ultimately lead right ventricular ( RV ) failure premature death . PAH may idiopathic ( IPAH ) may also relate various condition like portal hypertension , HIV infection , leave right shunt , connective tissue disease scleroderma ( PAHSSc ) . PAH define mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP ) &gt; 25 mmHg rest . Symptoms include dyspnea fatigue result restricted exercise capacity poor quality life . The agent currently approve treatment PAH prostanoids ( i.v . epoprostenol s.c./i.v . treprostinil ) , endothelin-receptor antagonist ( ambrisentan , bosentan sitaxsentan ) , phosphodiesterase type 5-inhibitors ( sildenafil tadalafil ) . These therapy show improve pulmonary hemodynamics , exercise capacity , quality life survival . Indeed , recent study describe three year survival high 80 % . This improved survival associate major challenge clinicians patient remain limited exercise capacity poor quality life . A clear understanding exercise physiopathology thus mandatory specifically address mechanism responsible exercise limitation eventually improve patient ' management . In order well characterize exercise physiopathology PAH , general objective research systematically examine blood flow distribution limb muscle microcirculation rest submaximal exercise PAH . The limited link traditional measure pulmonary hemodynamic impairment functional capacity confirm exercise physiopathology PAH well understood . Although peripheral muscle dysfunction exercise intolerance certainly multifactorial origin unlikely explain single mechanism , alter skeletal muscle microcirculation could represent unify mechanism explain similarity skeletal muscle dysfunction exercise intolerance PAH . The investigator plan use multimodality approach provide comprehensive information regard skeletal muscle perfusion PAH . For example , investigator able know relationship muscle perfusion heterogeneity ( arterial spin label MRI ) microvascular oxygenation muscle oxygen consumption ( NIRS ) . Muscle oxygen delivery could also influence cardiac function hypoxemia . These method thus view complimentary help separate difference cardiac function , quadriceps global perfusion , perfusion heterogeneity oxygenation consequence skeletal muscle function exercise tolerance PAH versus control .</detailed_description>
