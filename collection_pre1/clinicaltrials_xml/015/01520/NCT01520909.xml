Patients must refractory relapse least one prior ITP therapy , patient must unable , medical reason , continue ITP treatment . Patients must Day 1 ( within 48 hour prior ) platelet count &lt; 30 Gi/L . Previous therapy ITP immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) must complete least 2 week prior Day 1 , therapy must complete least 1 week prior Day 1 clearly ineffective . Previous treatment ITP splenectomy , rituximab cyclophosphamide must complete least 4 week prior Day 1 . Patients treat concomitant ITP medication ( e.g . corticosteroid azathioprine ) must receive dose stable least 4 week prior Day 1 . Patients must complete blood count ( CBC ) suggestive another hematological disorder . Patients must follow laboratory result : prothrombin time international normalize ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within 80 120 % normal range . clinical chemistry NOT exceed upper limit normal reference range 20 % following : creatinine , ALT , AST , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase . total albumin low limit normal 10 % .

In France , patient eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Patients clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , identify screen examination medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make patient unsuitable participation study suggest another primary diagnosis ( e.g . Thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Patients concurrent past malignant disease , include myeloproliferative disorder . Patients expect suitable continuation current therapy least 13 additional week . Patients history platelet agglutination abnormality prevents reliable measurement platelet count . Patients diagnosis secondary immune thrombocytopenia , include laboratory clinical evidence HIV infection , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis c virus infection , evidence active hepatitis time subject screening . Patients Evans syndrome ( autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune hemolysis ) . Patients know inherited thrombocytopenia ( e.g . MYH9 disorder ) . Patients treated medication affect platelet function ( include limit aspirin , clopidogrel and/or NSAIDS ) anticoagulants &gt; 3 consecutive day within 2 week Day 1 . Patients receive treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede Day 1 . Patients previously receive eltrombopag thrombopoietin receptor agonist . Any patient consider child care , define one place control protection agency , organization , institution entity court , government government body , act accordance power confer law regulation . This include child cared foster parent live care home institution , provide arrangement fall within definition . The definition child care include child adopt appointed legal guardian .
