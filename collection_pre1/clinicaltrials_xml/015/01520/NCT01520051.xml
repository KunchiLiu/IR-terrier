	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway characterize low respiratory tract ( LRT ) symptom wheeze , cough airway obstruction . Patients asthma frequently suffer exacerbation , trigger allergen , particular , viral respiratory infection . It recently show mepolizumab , humanize monoclonal antibody neutralize interleukin ( IL ) -5 , markedly reduce exacerbation rate asthma patient eosinophilic airway inflammation . Previous study indicate mixed population ( eosinophilic non eosinophilic ) mild asthma patient , mepolizumab impact lung function asthma symptom score upon allergen provocation , although marker sputum blood eosinophil . Together , observation lead hypothesis mepolizumab treatment reduce exacerbation rate limit virus-induced asthma exacerbation . The investigator hypothesize neutralization IL-5 virus infection patient allergic asthma : 1 . Reduces virus-induced bronchial inflammation 2 . Attenuates virus-induced asthma symptom , airflow limitation bronchial hyperresponsiveness . 3 . Enhances cellular immune response virus . The aim study : 1 . To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization reduces inflammatory response viral airway infection allergic asthma patient 2 . To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization prevents reduce asthma symptom virus-induced asthma exacerbation 3 . To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization affect cellular immune response viral airway infection allergic asthma patient</brief_summary>
