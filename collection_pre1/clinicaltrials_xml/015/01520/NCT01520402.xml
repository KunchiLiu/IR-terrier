	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine importance genetic difference individual ' response warfarin group healthy subject . Warfarin also know `` trade name '' Coumadin class medication call anticoagulant `` blood thinner . '' Warfarin work reduce blood 's ability make clot . It use stop blood clot form grow large blood blood vessel . Warfarin prescribe many condition , include people certain type irregular heartbeat , people replacement mechanical heart valve , people suffer heart attack , people orthopedic surgery , history blood clot . Warfarin use prevent treat deep vein thrombosis ( swell blood clot vein ) , pulmonary embolism ( blood clot lung ) , stroke ( blood clot brain ) . Researchers find certain gene may affect person 's body break react warfarin . If genetic information help doctor well determine best dose warfarin first give , may help doctor get patient correct level blood thin thereby reduce risk bleed risk develop blood clot . The expectation study information ultimately improve warfarin therapy lessen risk associate dosing error . This study consider investigational subject healthy prescribe warfarin clinical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Warfarin highly effective oral anticoagulant increasingly prescribe United States . It narrow therapeutic window , however , represent inherent limitation , insufficient excessive level anticoagulation associate elevated risk thrombosis bleed particularly frequent early initial dose-finding phase therapy . Typically , anticoagulation achieve empiric dose titration consideration certain variable frequent assessment international normalize ratio ( INR ) . Despite precaution , conventional dosing strategy associate therapeutic level anticoagulation half time treatment . Recently , genetic variant , specifically variation CYP2C9 VKORC1 gene , identify affect warfarin dose requirement , prompt expectation gene-based dosing strategy may maximize therapeutic efficacy minimize risk associate dosing error . While association variation gene difference warfarin dose requirement identify , specific contribution allelic variation response warfarin administration thoroughly identify . The investigator therefore seek ass impact allelic variation warfarin dose-response relationship group healthy subject . The investigator hypothesize genetic variation CYP2C9 VKORC1 enzymes result difference warfarin dose-response relationship account non-genetic factor affect pharmacokinetics warfarin effect coagulation .</detailed_description>
