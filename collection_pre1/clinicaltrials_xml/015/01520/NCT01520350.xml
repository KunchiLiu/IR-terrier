	<brief_summary>Aripiprazole new antipsychotic agent posse unique capability compare antipsychotic agent , especially partial dopaminergic agonistic activity . Moreover , like atypical agent , aripiprazole antagonist 5-HT2a receptor , agonist 5-HT1a receptor . These pharmacological property enable molecule provide antidepressant potentiate capability base observed compound share similar pharmacological profile . Aripiprazole well recognize capacity potentiate antidepressant treatment unipolar depression . However , two randomize control trial aripiprazole treatment bipolar depression negative . This surprising result may stem fact dos aripiprazole use study rather high ( 17.6 ± 8.3 mg/d study 1 15.5 ± 7.5 mg/d study 2 ) could contribute inhibit dopaminergic activity key brain area involve modulation reward , motivation concentration . Bipolar depression indeed heavily load general symptom psychomotor retardation include poor concentration , low energy level , hypersomnolence , hyperphagia . All function modulate dopamine strategy aim improve dopaminergic function use frequently resolve residual symptom bipolar depression . It expect aripiprazole use adequate low dose previous study , efficacious treatment bipolar type I depression .</brief_summary>
