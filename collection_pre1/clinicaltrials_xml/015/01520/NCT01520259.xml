	<brief_summary>Background : - Chile high diagnosis death rate gallbladder cancer world . Gallbladder cancer also lead cause cancer death Chilean woman . High rate gallstones obesity , well genetic concern , may explain high rate . Researchers want study gallbladder cancer depth Chile . A small study must do see full-scale study feasible . Objectives : - To test method procedures small-scale study gallbladder cancer Chile . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age gallbladder cancer gallstone , healthy control volunteer . - Participants recruit four clinical center Chile . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Because gallbladder cancer high fatality rate , family member may ask provide additional medical history information study participant die become ill provide information . - Participants provide blood , urine , stool , hair , fingernail , saliva sample . - Gallstones , bile , tissue sample collect gallbladder removal surgery . Normal tumor tissue sample collect need . - Treatment provide part protocol . This data collection study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Study Gallbladder Cancer Chile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose pilot study gallbladder cancer ( approximately 120 subject ) Chile 2011-2012 ass feasibility conduct plan full-scale population-based multidisciplinary gallbladder cancer study Chile . After completion pilot study , plan submit concept SAG proposal TEP review/approval full-scale study 2012 . It important timely study gallbladder cancer Chile country high report gallbladder cancer incidence mortality world , rate 6-10 time higher report United States . Moreover , gallbladder cancer lead cause cancer death Chilean woman third leading cause cancer death among Chilean men ( next stomach lung cancer ) . Reasons high risk gallbladder cancer Chile unclear , although high prevalence obesity gallstone well genetic susceptibility suggest explain part high risk gallbladder cancer population . In 2009 , NCI Chilean government sign letter intent join force identify reason high risk gallbladder cancer Chile hop develop strategy cancer prevention . Subsequently , DCEG NCI Office Latin America Cancer Program Development ( OLACPD ) organize gallbladder workshop U.S. Chilean scientist Santiago , Chile . Workshop participant conclude large-scale multidisciplinary epidemiologic investigation Chile urgently need clarify risk factor specific Chilean population help derive preventive strategy reduce burden gallbladder cancer Chile . Before NCI/DCEG commit substantial resource support large field effort , propose evaluate feasibility successfully carry high quality multidisciplinary epidemiologic study Chile . We request TEP approval This protocol describe pilot study gallbladder cancer Chile case-control four hospital ( 120 subject , include 40 cancer case , 40 gallstone case , 40 population control ) assess feasibility conduct large study Chile component , include gallbladder cancer case , gallstone patient , population-based control , gallstone expansion recruit additional patient undergo cholecystectomy population-based control explore gallstone high-risk population . The total number participant recruit 420 .</detailed_description>
