	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether CPI-613 effective safe either patient refractory relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) fail therapy hypomethylating agent ( decitabine [ Vidaza ] azacitidine [ AZA ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Study CPI-613 Treat Refractory Relapsed Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new therapy AML necessary , although several treatment option patient AML , treatment toxic available AML patient useful acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . Also , essentially treatment patient refractory relapse AML outside bone marrow transplant . Accordingly , great medical need safe effective therapy AML , especially refractory relapse AML . Also , although hypomethylating agent find effective MDS , agent toxic . Furthermore , relapse hypomethylating agent , treatment disease . A nearly complete clinical trial CPI-613 ( Cornerstone Study # CL-CPI-613-009 Wake Forest Study # CCCWFU 29109 , IND # 107,800 ) show CPI-613 well tolerate dos high 3,000 mg/m2 . Results nearly complete trial also suggest CPI- 613 may effective refractory relapse AML , well MDS relapse hypomethylating agent . Therefore , CPI-613 may suitable treatment option refractory/relapsed AML MDS relapse hypomethylating agent . The promising preliminary efficacy data Study # CL-CPI-613-009 ( Wake Forest Study # CCCWFU 29109 , IND # 107,800 ) basis Cornerstone conduct current Phase 2a trial ass efficacy CPI-613 disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have either document refractory relapse AML , document MDS risk group fail hypomethylating agent ( decitabine [ Vidaza ] azacitidine [ AZA ] ) . ( Therapy failure hypomethylating agent define patient sufficiently treat hypomethylating agent without response opinion treat physician , whose disease progress relapsed hypomethylating agent . ) Has never treat CPI613 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . Expected survival &gt; 2 month . 18 year age old gender . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use accepted contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral contraceptive , double barrier device ) study , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior treatment initiation . Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive method study , unless documentation infertility exist . No radiotherapy , surgery hormonal therapy kind within 2 week prior participate study . Patients must fully recover acute toxicity prior treatment anticancer drug ( include hypomethylating agent MDS patient ) , radiotherapy anticancer modality ( i.e. , return baseline status note recent treatment ) tumor . Patients persist , stable chronic toxicity prior treatment â‰¤Grade 1 eligible , must document . Recombinant erythropoietin GCSF allow , since CPI613 induce myelosuppression . No evidence active serious infection kind within past month . No systemic fungal , bacterial , viral infection control , define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment . Signed informed consent form . Serious medical illness , significant cardiac disease ( e.g . symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , severe debilitate pulmonary disease , would potentially increase patient ' risk toxicity . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 6 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , abnormal ECG , symptomatic congestive heart failure . Any active uncontrolled bleeding , patient bleed diathesis ( e.g. , active peptic ulcer disease ) . Dyspnea minimal moderate exertion . Patients large pleural , pericardial , peritoneal effusion . Evidence active infection , serious infection within past month . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) epidural solid hematologic tumor . Patients receive standard investigational therapy tumor indication within past 2 week , investigational agent indication within past 4 week , prior study . Patients receive immunotherapy type indication within past 4 week prior study . Ongoing oral corticosteroid permit . However , topical inhale corticosteroid permit , prophylactic steroid allow transfusion reaction . Life expectancy le 2 month . Pregnant woman , woman childbearing potential use reliable mean contraception . Lactating female . Fertile men unwilling practice contraceptive method study period . Unwillingness inability follow protocol requirement .</criteria>
