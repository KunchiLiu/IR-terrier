The study primary endpoint overall response rate ( ORR ) determine Investigator evaluation . The ORR percentage subject achieve objective response ( i.e. , partial response well ) , use IWCLL update NCI-WG guideline . Response assessment plan follow time-points : After 3 Cycles ofatumumab plus bendamustine treatment , 6 Cycles ofatumumab plus bendamustine treatment last dose , 6 cycle , ofatumumab plus bendamustine treatment . Follow-up assessment perform every 3 month follow last study treatment . The follow-up period last maximum 3 year . Response evaluation assessment determine subject response progression perform follow-up period , accord IWCLL updated NCI-WG guideline .

	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Plus Bendamustine Frontline Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label , single arm , multi-centre study investigate safety efficacy ofatumumab plus bendamustine subject untreated relapsed CLL . The primary objective study evaluate investigator assess overall response rate ( ORR ) , use International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia ( IWCLL ) update National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group ( NCIWG ) guideline , two population i.e. , subject previously untreated CLL subject relapse CLL administer ofatumumab plus bendamustine . Secondary objective evaluate overall response rate compute tomography scan ( CT scan ) assessment , complete response rate without CT scan assessment , progression free survival , overall survival , duration response , safety tolerability , disease , prognostic biological marker correlation clinical response two population i.e. , subject previously untreated CLL subject relapse CLL administer ofatumumab plus bendamustine . Exploratory objective investigate relationship genetic variant host DNA efficacy , safety and/or tolerability ofatumumab . Each subject screen phase willing participate study find eligible accord inclusion exclusion criterion enter treatment phase receive maximum 6 Cycles study treatment ( ofatumumab plus bendamustine ) . All subject receive 3 Cycles study treatment ( Cycles 1 , 2 3 ) . Eligibility receive study treatment Cycles 4 , 5 6 assess follow 3rd Cycle . Subjects achieve least stable disease acceptable toxicity follow 3 Cycles treatment eligible continue receive study treatment maximum 3 Cycles . In case progressive disease , , time start Cycle 4 , subject must discontinue study treatment move study 's follow-up period . During treatment phase , eligible subject allocate receive follow study treatment : 1 . Subjects Untreated CLL : Up 6 monthly intravenous infusion ofatumumab ( Cycle 1 : 300 mg Day 1 1000 mg Day 8 ; subsequent Cycles : 1000 mg Day 1 every 28 Days ) combination 6 Cycles intravenously infuse bendamustine ( 90 mg/m2 , Days 1 2 , every 28 Days ) . 2 . Subjects Relapsed CLL : Up 6 monthly intravenous infusion ofatumumab ( Cycle 1 : 300 mg Day 1 1000 mg Day 8 ; subsequent Cycles : 1000 mg Day 1 every 28 Days ) combination 6 Cycles intravenously infuse bendamustine ( 70 mg/m2 , Days 1 2 , every 28 Days ) . Prior treatment Cycle , subject must absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.0 x 109/L , platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L , must recover Grade 1 baseline clinically significant non-hematologic toxicity , nausea , vomit alopecia . If retreatment criterion meet , treatment delay 28 Days permit ; thereafter , study treatment bendamustine ofatumumab must discontinue . In case delay 14 Days , bendamustine treatment continue dosage , case delay 15-28 Days , dosage bendamustine must reduce 60 mg/m2 subsequent treatment Cycles subject recruit study previously untreated CLL 50 mg/m2 subsequent treatment Cycles subject recruit study relapse CLL . Additionally , within Cycle , subject develop clinically significant Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity , nausea , vomit alopecia , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.0 x 109/L , platelet count &lt; 50 % pre-treatment value , bendamustine dose also reduce stated subsequent treatment Cycles . Blood sample , lymph node examination , spleen liver measurement , constitutional symptom evaluation perform monthly throughout treatment phase . A bone marrow examination require confirm complete response ( CR ) least two month final study treatment subject fulfils IWCLL update NCI-WG requirement CR . CT-Scans also perform , least two month final study treatment , subject achieve CR partial response ( PR ) accord IWCLL update NCI-WG requirement . Follow-up assessment perform every 3 month follow last study treatment . The follow-up period last maximum 3 year . Response evaluation assessment determine subject response progression perform follow-up period , accord IWCLL updated NCI-WG guideline [ Hallek , 2008 ] . Following progression , survival status detail concern subject 's next CLL therapy record .</detailed_description>
