	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disorder characterize motor symptom tremor , slowness movement , stiffness , lead progressive disability loss independence . Lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) , include urinary incontinence ( UI ) , urgency , and/or nocturia , common non-motor symptom diminish already compromise quality life adult live PD . Behavioral intervention UI - include pelvic floor muscle exercise ( PFME ) therapy - proven efficacy randomize controlled trial free side effect . Exercise-based behavioral therapy UI require individual learn motor skill ( PFME ) implement adaptive behavioral strategy incorporate PFME suppress urinary urgency prevent UI . We conduct two-site , randomize control trial ass efficacy PFME-based behavioral therapy treat urinary symptom adult PD . After stratification UI severity , PD severity , gender , group 60 subject ( 30 group ) randomize receive behavioral therapy behavioral control 8 week order achieve sample size 50 individual ( 25 group ) complete study . A 6-month follow-up plan treatment group . We hypothesize : 1 . PD participant randomize exercise-based behavioral therapy group ( Group A ) report significant reduction weekly frequency UI episode compare PD participant behavioral control group ( Group B ) . The primary outcome , frequency UI , measure use seven-day bladder diary . 2 . Compared PD participant Group B , reduction UI frequency Group A clinically meaningful measure corresponding improvement questionnaire satisfaction quality life well decline urinary symptom include urgency nocturia .</brief_summary>
