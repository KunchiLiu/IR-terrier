	<brief_summary>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) often remain curative treatment haematological malignancy . The anti-leukaemic effect allogeneic HSCT , call GvL ( Graf-versus-Leukemia ) effect , often associate development immune response healthy recipient cell lead graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) 20 70 % allogeneic HSCT . Acute GvHD , usually target skin , gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract liver , important cause morbidity mortality allogeneic HSCT , particularly case GI GvHD . The main goal research field allogeneic HSCT determine strategy could decrease risk GvHD without affect GvL effect . According GVHD experimental model , likely GvL GvHD may occur absence inflammatory signal induce transplant-associated conditioning . Based hypothesis , choose analyse role Complement system patient receive allogeneic HSCT . Indeed , Complement system major actor inflammation generation tissue destruction , involve physiopathology GVHD . Furthermore , might potential target available inhibitory drug ( purify C1-Inhibitor , anti-C5 antibody ) preventive curative manner patient . Preliminary data obtain 34 allografted patient institution suggest Complement activation classical pathway correlate occurrence GI GVHD . The goal current project , order confirm preliminary result large series , explore Complement system activation patient receive allogeneic HSCT three Adult Hematology department Paris fot two year correlate biological result clinical event occur HSCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study perform allografted patient myeloablative condition haematological malignancy 3 adult transplant unit . Patients follow least12 month transplantation blood sample draw condition week 12 week transplantation analyze : - serum concentration Complement factor ( C3 , C4 , B factor ) , Complement regulatory protein ( C1-inhibitor , I H Factors ) analysis surface expression Complement regulatory molecule CD46 , CD55 CD59 . - serum inflammatory cytokine level In addition , patient clinical sign gut GVHD explore gastrointestinal endoscopy perform gut biopsy . C5b9 deposure analyze immunohistochemistry GVHD lesion . Activation complement system define decrease complement factor level 50 % value low physiological limit . The clinical evolution inflammatory cytokine profile patient activation profile compare without complement activation . A data base contain biological clinical data establish . Biological result correlate post-transplant clinical event , particular occurrence gut GVHD also non relapse mortality overall survival adapt statistical test ( comparison percentages Chi-2 Pearson , comparison survival curve logrank , multivariate analysis logistic regression test cox model ) . The number require patient establish comparison percentage gut GVHD patient without complement activation . Based preliminary result , hypothesize 2/3 patient complement activation among whose 20 % develop acute gut GVHD . We expect increase acute gut GVHD 60 % patient complement activation would represent 1/3 cohort . With bilateral alpha risk 5 % power 80 % , number require patient 23 activate group 46 non activate group , thus total 69 patient .</detailed_description>
