	<detailed_description>Traditionally clinicians program safety margin right atrial , right ventricular , leave ventricular lead two-times capture threshold . This safety margin necessary right atrial right ventricular output prevent asystole fluctuation capture threshold . This two-times safety margin may necessary leave ventricular lead output may cause short device battery longevity . Newly implement LV capture threshold management algorithm may help maintain proper balance safety margin battery longevity . However , recent research conduct automatic leave ventricular capture measurement ( LVCM ) show much 3.5 V daily variability capture threshold . In study , 18 % patient &gt; 1.5 V LV threshold variability . A possible explanation variability LV threshold lead stability . Small movement lead electrode associated movement patient posture may account daily fluctuation capture threshold . As heart failure patient care therapy improve , CRT patient may survive long project longevity device . In order minimize patient risk associated device change-outs , care must take maximize battery longevity maintain CRT pacing . Examining patient posture change possible cause threshold variability may guide clinician program appropriate LV output patient safety device longevity mind .</detailed_description>
