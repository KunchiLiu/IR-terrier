	<brief_summary>Many publication deal natural history aortic aneurysms literature . Except connective tissue disorder Marfan Loeys-Dietz syndrome , aortic aneurysm complex multifactorial disease genetic environmental risk factor . Susceptibility loci identify thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) overlap , suggest different genetic risk factor contribute two form aneuryms . With high prevalence correlate age ( 5 % ) , AAA usually present degenerative form disease . However , recent epidemiologic study Olsson et al . reveal increase incidence thoracic aortic disease among old individual ( 70+/-12 year ) 60 % aneurysmal rupture dissection diagnosis , 1.7 :1 male-to-female ratio compare 6:1 AAA . From current knowledge arises concept diffuse plurisegmental degenerative aneurysmal aortic disease , poorly explore far . As regard prevention policy , consensus statement ultrasonography screen AAA recommend individual age &gt; 60 year ( particularly men ever smoke ) age &gt; 50 year family history AAA . Nevertheless , screen concomittant thoracic location disease ( except thoracoabdominal aneurysm ) yet require , whereas could change prognosis patient influence management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through constitution multicentric prospective cohort patient infra-renal AAA ( n=450 ) , investigator aim determine prevalence concomitant TAA , epidemiologic , clinical , biological genetic factor relate aortic phenotype . Therefore , investigator postulate prevalence AAA-TAA association inferior equal 15 % . By use innovating software ( AMIRA ) analyse scan , investigator perform reproductive measurement segmental diameter segmental aortic volumetric numerized imaging , describe different thoracic aortic phenotype associate AAA , include form ( TAA , penetrate ulcer , dolichoaorta … ) location disease .</detailed_description>
