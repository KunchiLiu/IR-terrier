She/he also ask question emotion , memory function , ability simple task . If woman able become pregnant ask urine pregnancy test . After visit subject stop taking study medication 2 week ( 2 week washout period ) . Week 4 ( 4 hour ) He/she ask brief medical question receive brief physical exam , detailed test brain nerve function . He/she ask question emotion , memory function , ability simple task . He/she give new supply study medication . The subject ask take 1 tablet study medication clinic observe 2 hour afterward see he/she immediate side effect . Blood pressure check . On day clinic visit subject take 2 tablet study medication . Thereafter subject take 2 tablet study medication morning .
