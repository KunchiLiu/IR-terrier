	<brief_summary>This observational , retrospective prospective study subject undergone surgery EBA2 medical device lateral proximal femoral fracture follow data collection since day surgery ( retrospectively ) day 180 surgery ( retrospectively prospectively ) . This study aim collect data patient already treat EBA2 nail . Data collection cover detail fracture surgery ( retrospective nature study ) , well detail follow visit surgery patient routinely carry 6 month ( prospective nature study ) .

	<brief_title>Observational Retrospective Prospective Study Treatment Femoral Fractures With EBA2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EBA2 , technological evolution Endovis BA , available . The device develop conformity Regulations 93/42/CE 2007/47/CE , CE trademark register Italian National Registry Medical Devices . EBA2 unique feature describe : - undersized compare nail commerce , proximal distal , facilitate insertion bone . The undersizing aim reduce stiffness stem . In particular , biological nail-bone interaction improve consequence lower shear stress frontal plane ; - make entirely titanium . The choice material aim create flexible mean synthesis minimizes difference healthy bone mechanical property reduce complication process fracture healing ; - dual-lag screw system provide appropriate guidance sliding fractured extremity improve stability . It effective limit torsional instability femoral head , intervention , action tighten screw , heal period due improve bearing capacity towards multidirectional load ; - associate surgical instrument simple ; low number piece ease use make success even previous version . The aim present observational study collect data confirm EBA2 , technological evolution Endovis BA , performance tolerability prove previous trial . In addition , give increase importance good quality life represent elderly , objective observational study verify general satisfaction patient lateral proximal femoral fracture treat EBA2 . In order evaluate subject 's walking ability surgical insertion EBA2 , subject could walk independently fracture include observational study .</detailed_description>
