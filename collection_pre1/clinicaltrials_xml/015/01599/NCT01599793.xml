	<brief_summary>This study do help researcher understand prostate cancer spread bone use new magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques well understand effect experimental drug call XL184 ( cabozantinib ) bone disease . The purpose study good understand effect XL184 prostate cancer progression , bone pain , cancer cell patient may circulate within blood ( call circulate tumor cell )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect XL184 functional MRI metric Ktrans apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) within castrate resistant prostate cancer bone metastasis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify progression free survival men castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) treat XL184 accord Prostate Cancer Working Group criterion . II . To correlate change MRI base functional metric bone scan , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response criterion , circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) number change pain . III . To explore c-MET , phospho-c-MET stain circulate tumor cell predictive biomarker response duration response XL-184 . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
