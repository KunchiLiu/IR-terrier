	<brief_title>Atazanavir/r + Lamivudine Dual Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction combine antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) dramatically improve prognosis HIV infection [ 1 ] ; nowadays , virological suppression ( viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL ) obtain vast majority patient receive cART . Nevertheless , antiretroviral drug short- long-term side effect mainly regard mitochondrial toxicity , impaired lipid glucose metabolism , impairment renal function bone density may contribute increase patient ' cardiovascular risk . Current treatment guideline recommend three drug regimens `` backbone '' 2 nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( N ( ) RTIs ) `` third drug '' choose among non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PIr ) . Regimens contain less three antiretroviral drug currently recommend base high risk virological failure selection drug resistance mutation ( DRM ) previous experience NRTI-only base approach exception boost PIs monotherapy optional patient intolerance NRTIs require treatment simplification provide never experience virological failure admit exceptional circumstance . Nevertheless , investigation possible new treatment paradigm remain attractive due high potency low risk selection drug resistance mutation PIr base therapy establish long term toxicity even newer currently prefer N ( ) RTIs , particular renal bone toxicity tenofovir debate potential association increase cardiovascular risk abacavir , describe cohort study . Studies evaluate N ( ) RTI-sparing treatment strategy thus increase order try respond unmet medical need HIV-infected patient metabolic complication increase risk cardiovascular renal disease . These study need investigate safety efficacy alternative strategy , also evaluate possible effect renal function , bone mass density risk premature osteoporosis . Atazanavir ritonavir generally well tolerate lipid-friendly protease inhibitor mild effect lipid metabolism even combine low-dose ritonavir drug achieve non-significant difference virological efficacy compare efavirenz ; like PIr-based regimen , failure atazanavir/ritonavir contain cART seem protect development drug resistance mutation PI backbone . Lamivudine well tolerate NRTI show significant toxicity short long term , together analog emtricitabine , prefer option major international treatment guideline ; good CNS penetration score signature resistance mutation ( M184V ) deeply impairs viral fitness compromise future treatment option . The combination two drug could therefore appeal possibility treatment switch stably virologically suppressed treatment-experienced patient toxicity-related issue . The result previously plan 24 week interim analysis monocentric 48 week Italian pilot study evaluate strategy 40 patient recently present IAS conference Vienna show virologic failure without `` blip '' good tolerability significant improvement renal function measure MDRD . These data look promise allow u confident design randomize study order confirm finding .</detailed_description>
