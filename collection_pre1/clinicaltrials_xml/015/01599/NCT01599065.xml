	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two option management ICDs ( internal cardioverter defibrillator ) patient undergoing procedure electrocautery : ( 1 ) program ICD therapy `` , '' ( 2 ) use magnet suspend ICD therapy By compare two technique investigator hope demonstrate efficiency use ICD magnet protocol perioperative management patient undergo electrocautery procedure . Secondary purpose gain information health care resource , incidence EMI , handoff communication document lack adverse event either group . Primary objective : ICD therapy `` time '' less use magnet protocol compare `` off-on '' protocol . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) Healthcare resource ( time cost skilled personnel ) less use magnet protocol compare off-on protocol , ( 2 ) difference adverse event magnet protocol compare off-on protocol . The incidence EMI number handoff communication document . The investigator hypothesis number minute ICD therapies `` '' significantly less magnet use . The investigator also expect health care resource less magnet use compare reprogramming .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design prospective multi-center randomize control trial subject randomize either control group ( ICD `` off-on '' group ) experimental group ( magnet group ) within block type procedure site . Subjects enrol time procedure remain study post operative device interrogation . This could take place day ( `` '' group registry ) next ICD clinic visit remote transmission ( 3 month procedure ) . The study duration first enrollment closure expect last approximately 12 month . There two enrolling center target sample size 150 subject various manufacturer . No specific sample size calculate pilot study .</detailed_description>
