	<detailed_description>Rib fracture common injury sustain follow blunt trauma . Ziegler Agarwal note population 7000 trauma patient , 10 % fractured rib . These injury normally hallmark significant chest trauma ; number fracture ribs increase , exponential increase morbidity mortality . This injury therefore pose challenge problem pulmonary analgesia standpoint . Significant morbidity often result hypoventilation lead atelectasis , pneumonia , respiratory failure . Pain management recognize important factor prevent complication . Good analgesia may help improve patient 's respiratory mechanic , lead decrease need mechanical ventilatory support , shorten hospital stay , dramatically alter course recovery impact morbidity mortality . For healthy patient one two fracture rib , systemic analgesic may suffice . For three four fracture rib , study experience reaffirm superior analgesia make possible continuous thoracic epidural , continuous thoracic paravertebral , continuous intercostal block , however , comparative head head trial compare relative merit disadvantage technique undertaken multiple rib fracture patient . Placing catheter , possible use three technique , allow continuation analgesia multiple day one block , essential option treat patient likely need extend analgesia . All option available patient , however , current American Society Regional Anesthesiology advise performance epidural paravertebral block patient abnormal INR ( BWH , equal 1.2 , and/or treatment anticoagulant gpIIb/IIIa inhibitor ( heparin heparin-like medication usually acceptable within certain dosing time frame ) . Rib fracture follow trauma associate severe postoperative pain significant morbidity . Atelectasis , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , intensive care admission relate poor analgesia consequent immobility splint inspiration . With traumatic multiple fracture rib ( MFR ) , concomitant lung injury expect . The effect injury exacerbate pain MFR lead guarding , shallow breath , suboptimal chest physiotherapy . Atelectasis , pneumonia , consolidation , respiratory failure ensue , necessitate prolong assist ventilation and/or oxygenation increase morbidity mortality . Additionally , inadequately treat pain rib fracture lead chronic pain global deconditioning . Without implementation effective regional and/or neuraxial analgesia , need use sedative systemic opioid medication increase , potential increase length stay increase complication delirium , aspiration , decrease mobility subsequent great deconditioning increase risk embolic event , addiction , possibly chronic pain . These risk even high old individual ( age &gt; 55 ) , comorbidities poor respiratory reserve conspire increase morbidity mortality , less able handle recover side effect sedative systemic opioid medication . Additionally , trauma patient may also high risk due multiple , often confound , injury . Options analgesia aside regional block include use NSAIDs , acetaminophen , opioids , ketamine , transdermal lidocaine ( patch ) . The short-term disadvantage NSAID include gastric irritation , platelet inhibition renal injury . Acetaminophen high dos hepatotoxic . Powerful opioids depressant , suppress cough , increase risk delirium , may promote respiratory complication even reduce pain . Ketamine cause dissociation risk hallucination , often unpleasant nature . Assessment head abdominal injury compromise systemic opioids ketamine . Of note , none medication well tolerated dos sufficient greatly diminish pain MFR chest physiotherapy coughing , delay recovery , none treatment , well tolerated dos , provide sufficient analgesia without cause significant side effect , even combination . Lidocaine patch fracture sit ineffective . Regional/neuraxial block provide superior analgesia , impact successful block immediate substantial , , especially regard elderly , authority categorically state 55-65 year-olds three four fracture rib receive regional block . The relative lack systemic sedation make easy monitor patient head abdominal injury , reduce need systemic medication obviate inherent concomitant risk . Though effective , use epidural block intubate unresponsive patient , especially thoracic region , currently widely accept fear inadvertent adverse neurologic complication . This say , incidence neurological complication associate patient respond incidental injury associate placement epidural anesthesia general anesthesia , example unresponsive patient , precisely know . Horlocker et al state `` possibility serious complication may still high 0.08 % . '' Regardless exact incidence rate , prevail wisdom risk benefit ratio support practice epidural/deep plexus regional anesthesia unconscious patient clear association pain placement injection subsequent injury , speak need feedback patient prevent injury . In comparison epidural analgesia , major complication PVB ICNB pneumothorax document account nerve damage due lateral anatomic plane medication delivery reference central nerve axis . However , patient chest tube risk effectively obviate . Moreover , use ultrasound , greatly enhance ability avoid pleura , improve accuracy safety block . Additionally , view pain relief method provide great preservation pulmonary spirometric function thoracotomy-related rib trauma , effective analgesic method paravertebral analgesia , patient approximately 75 % preoperative value first 48 hour surgery . Most technique e.g . traditional intercostal nerve block , epidural local anesthetic local anesthetic-opiate combination produce approximately 55 % preservation 48 hour , interpleural analgesia least effective , mean 35 % preservation 48 hour , less even TENS cryoanalgesia . These finding suggest thoracic paravertebral block best available analgesic method rib trauma patient : however , study perform post-surgical setting trauma setting , concentrate finding respiratory parameter , pain relief , though two may relate . The primary question investigator wish answer study whether continuous PVB equal efficacy epidural anesthesia term analgesia patient INR low 1.2 , continuous ICNB equal efficacy PCA term analgesia , patient INRs equal great 1.2 measure difference visual analog pain score 48 hour . Secondary question : PVBs ICNBs result favorable side effect profile , low complication rate , improve pulmonary mechanic , decrease need intubation , decrease length intubation , reduce supplemental oxygenation need , reduce length stay , improve speed work physical therapy and/or occupational therapy , less need short/long term rehabilitation discharge , less development chronic pain compare epidural block opioid PCA rib fracture patient .</detailed_description>
