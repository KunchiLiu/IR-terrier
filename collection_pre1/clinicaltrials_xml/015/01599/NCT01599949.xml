	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Ibrutinib , Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Progress After Bortezomib Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm ( patient receive study drug ) study evaluate efficacy safety ibrutinib patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) receive least 1 rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen progress bortezomib therapy . Approximately 110 eligible patient enrol . During treatment phase , patient receive 560 mg ibrutinib mouth daily continuously disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end , whichever occur first . Treatment continuous ( without interruption ) self-administered home . Doses hold reduce base severity recovery side effect study drug . The sponsor ensure patient benefit treatment ibrutinib able continue treatment end study . Data collect disease response treatment , progression-free survival , overall survival , subsequent anti-MCL therapy . Serial pharmacokinetic ( study body drug ) sample collect detailed protocol . Safety monitor throughout study . An interim analysis pharmacokinetic data occur approximately 3 month schedule pharmacokinetic sampling Cycles 1 2 complete . Data analyze 1 year last patient enrol primary analysis 2 year last patient enrol final follow-up .</detailed_description>
