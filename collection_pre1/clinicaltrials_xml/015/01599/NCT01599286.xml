	<brief_summary>The overall objective drug trial determine whether treatment acute hyperammonemia N-carbamyl-L-glutamate ( NCG , Carglumic acid , NCG ) propionic acidemia ( PA ) , methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA ) , late-onset CPS1 deficiency ( CPSD ) late-onset Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( OTCD ) accelerate resolution hyperammonemia efficiently safely . The primary goal determine study drug ( NCG ) efficiently reduce ammonia level follow hyperammonemia episode ( ) . Secondly , investigator want know treatment study drug ( NCG ) efficiently improve neurologic function , reduce plasma glutamine level lessen duration hospitalization hyperammonemic episode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Outcome N-Carbamylglutamate Treatment Acute Hyperammonemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind randomized clinical drug trial evaluate efficacy NCG treatment two organic acidemia ( severe PA MMA ) , two urea-cycle disorder ( late-onset CPSD OTCD ) . Primarily , investigator want determine whether NCG treatment acute hyperammonemia severe , neonatal-onset PA , MMA , CPSD OTCD efficacious , whether safe . The investigator approach task two way : 1 . Assess whether NCG treatment effective The objective study ass whether NCG efficacious treat hyperammonemia improve outcome : - The investigator realize goal randomize hyperammonemic episode every subject NCG ( NCG ) +standard treatment ( NCG-STD ) versus placebo+standard treatment ( PLBO-STD ) subsequently gauge response primary outcome plasma ammonia level , addition plasma glutamine , Functional Status Scale , length hospitalization . 2 . Safety The primary safety outcome study assess via rate Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) define study death substantial prolongation hospitalization , patient hospitalize part entry study . Safety test consist complete blood count ( CBC ) , liver kidney function test , coagulation profile ( PTT/INR ) perform treatment , third day treatment , prior discontinuation NCG . An electrocardiogram perform treatment third day treatment discharge earlier .</detailed_description>
