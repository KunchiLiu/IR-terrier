	<brief_summary>Porphyromonas gingivalis one major bacteria involve formation progression chronic periodontitis . Pathogens invade gingiva face host 's innate immune system first later acquire immune system include secreted antibody specialize cell . Although arm immune system coordinate overcome infection , several know mechanism help pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis evade immunity . As result , inflammatory mediator secrete immune cell cause tissue damage lead inflammation process towards chronicity instead clear pathogen . Up till recently study focus role macrophage , dendritic cell lymphocytes response periodontal pathogenic bacteria role fibroblast ( abundant cell connective tissue ) less examine . Fibroblasts spindle shaped cell ability produce extra cellular matrix respond growth factor cytokine . They able affect cell infect tissue contribute immune response efficiency . As known case lymphocytes , fibroblast also vary subtypes , differs phenotype , immune interaction , extra cellular matrix production destruction , migration ability . Two main fibroblast subtypes oral cavity originate gingival tissue periodontal ligament anchor teeth surround alveolar bone . Amongst differences two collagen production ability receptor profile cell surface . Considering , investigator aim obtain use periodontal ligament gingival tissue remove anyways common dental procedure order extract different fibroblast subtypes reside compare response Porphyromonas gingivalis .</brief_summary>
