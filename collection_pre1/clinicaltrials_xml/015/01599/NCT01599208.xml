	<brief_summary>The goal propose research map effects—in particular facilitation—of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Medial Temporal Lobes ( MTL ) onto process associative memory . TMS technology potential selectively enhance function mediate area temporal cortex , include MTL , know primary neuronal seat episodic memory . By use technology investigator understand theoretical model human memory ( specifically regard role Recollection Familiarity process ) , additionally , provide possible route recovery memory loss typically observe elderly—namely , memory association . Given MTL 's critical role human memory facilitation-inducing quality TMS , research goal provide nonintrusive tool facilitate memory performance young elderly healthy participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitating Associative Memory Via Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Medial Temporal Lobe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our theoretical motivation explore mechanisms underlie recognition memory . Evidence variety paradigm converge notion recognition memory comprise two process : 1 . Familiarity , entail item-specific information . 2 . Recollection , entail association-specific information . Evidence suggest recollection associate network neuronal region , include anterior medial prefrontal cortex , lateral parietal cortex , hippocampus . Familiarity , contrast , associate lateral prefrontal cortex peripheral cortex . Critically , familiarity recollection , vital role MTL strongly implicate . To dissociate recollection familiarity , despite stimulating location brain , investigator take account difference processing time two process know operate , use objective subjective cognitive task accurately measure effect . In addition , research clinical motivation , relate nature memory decline elderly . If successful , investigator able set effective TMS protocol could use tool enhance type memories—association-specific memories—that think mediate poor memory performance elderly . To achieve goal , propose experiment target MTL use online stimulation ( short-duration stimulation presentation stimuli recognition memory test ) enable u differentiate effect familiarity recollection offline stimulation mode ( repetitive stimulation several minute separately recognition memory test ) , goal achieve facilitation effect memory performance .</detailed_description>
