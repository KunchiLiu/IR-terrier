	<brief_summary>This study work towards understanding change body ( metabolism ) develop treatment prostate cancer . Hormonal therapy ADT often result detrimental change body composition , include lean tissue loss fat gain , compare patient receive radiation therapy . These change body composition link risk diabetes cardiovascular disease survivorship . The investigator evaluate 50 patient primarily examine change metabolism , nutrition , physical function body composition end treatment , 6 week 6 month follow end treatment . Patients continue follow every 6 month 5 year follow end treatment . The investigator finding provide new perspective future work novel approach treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects Treatment Intermediate High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermediate high risk prostate cancer patient generally undergo either watchful waiting , surgery , RT alone RT conjunction androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Prostate cancer patient receive upfront ADT exhibit drastic reduction testosterone , result loss key anabolic signal ultimately muscle loss adipose tissue gain . In non-malignant population , change body composition associate development insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . Hypogonadism also independently predictive hyperinsulinemia metabolic syndrome , may consequence ADT , increase saturate fat intake , inactivity well unhealthy change body composition treatment time-course . However , think obesity associate atherogenic profile , insulin resistance , biochemical failure , increase risk cancer recurrence and/or metabolic syndrome prostate cancer . The loss muscle largely attribute reduced anabolic stimulus due inactivity reduce androgen hormone ADT . As skeletal muscle important role glucose disposal , use RT alone reduce androgen hormone level may maintain muscle mass prevent deleterious metabolic effect exhibit ADT . Thus , different form therapy may present diverse change body composition ultimately metabolic implication . While discrepancy success ADT therapy , form therapy invariably result several detrimental metabolic change predispose prostate cancer patient survivor develop chronic disease diabetes cardiovascular disease well great risk cancer recurrence . In fact , prostate cancer patient undergo radical prostatectomy androgen deprivation therapy , lose muscle mass undergo treatment also develop great risk mortality cardiovascular disease compare prostate cancer patient receive form therapy . To date , study examine metabolic effect develop ADT and/or radiation therapy . The result propose study indicate potential metabolic change develop therapy . It important identify unhealthy change early specific nutrition exercise protocol may use improve clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
