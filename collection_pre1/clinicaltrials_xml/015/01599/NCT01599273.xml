	<brief_summary>Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy ( TAO ) autoimmune process affect orbital periorbital tissue thyroid gland . Periorbital inflammation cause swelling , fatty infiltration , scar eyelid muscle result eyelid retraction upper scleral exposure , common clinical feature TAO.Even mild eyelid retraction swelling , patient become disappointed depressed due cosmetically unacceptable appearance , unwilling wait spontaneous resolution clinically inactive period surgical intervention . Thus , ophthalmologist endocrinologists recommend surgery chronic burnt-out stage . Several treatment option describe correction eyelid retraction , include Botox filler injection , surgeries burnt-out stage lower upper lid recess levator muscle , excision MÃ¼ller 's muscle , introduce spacer , myotomies.Surgical option significant risk well unpredictable course outcome case . Several author report subconjunctival botulinum toxin injection provide immediate , effective treatment reduce excessive levator function patient suffer disfigure eyelid appearance want wait surgery upper eyelid retraction.Botox treatment usually temporary . However , unwanted ptosis , although temporary , observe five 24 patient ( 20.8 % ) study Costa , may even disappoint cosmetically unacceptable patients.Recently , hyaluronic acid gel filler , inject subconjunctival levator-Muller plane , demonstrate efficacy manage Graves ' eyelid retraction three patients.However , complication lump , fluid buildup , skin pigment darkening may occur use technique.Steroid treatment represent well-established TAO management strategy due anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive action . However , multiple systemic side effect diabetes , infection , hypertension , osteoporosis , stomach ulcer major drawback systemic steroid treatment . Due limitation systemic steroid treatment , several study report TAO improvement periorbital injection methylprednisolone triamcinolone , primarily focus reduce proptosis diplopia . So far , however , single small case series study suggest injection 20 mg triamcinolone subconjunctival region lid , conjunctiva Muller 's muscle , improve upper eyelid retraction within 1 month three four patient . The investigator aware study design demonstrate treatment efficacy locally administer triamcinolone improve eyelid retraction swell prospective manner . Therefore , aim evaluate short-term long-term effect subconjunctival triamcinolone injection treat eyelid retraction inflammatory swell cause TAO .</brief_summary>
