	<brief_summary>Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma treat combination chemotherapy monoclonal antibody rituximab ( chemoimmunotherapy ) . Following chemoimmunotherapy patient receive radiation therapy residue may active tumour . However end chemoimmunotherapy majority patient show tissue scar necessarily active tumor . In recent year , PET/CT prove good tool accurately identify active tumor scar tissue patient treat mediastinal lymphoma.The purpose trial test whether radiation therapy really necessary patient PET/CT show tumor longer active . Therefore compare radiation treatment careful observation . Patients end conventional treatment chemoimmunotherapy negative PET/CT ( i.e. , without residue suspect contain active tumor ) , randomly assign two different treatment group : one treatment group receive radiation treatment , treatment group receive careful observation . The trial plan accord non-inferiority design aim demonstrate progression free survival experimental treatment ( observation ) bad standard comparator ( mediastinal irradiation.Participation study could spare patient complete remission end chemo immunotherapy ( PET/CT negative ) radiation therapy may unnecessary .</brief_summary>
