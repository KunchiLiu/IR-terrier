	<brief_summary>ClarityIQ novel X-ray imaging technology , combine advance real-time image noise reduction algorithm , state-of-the-art hardware reduce patient entrance dose significantly . This realize anatomy-specific optimization full acquisition chain ( grid switch , beam filtering , pulse width , spot size , detector image processing engine ) every clinical task individually . Furthermore , small focal spot size , short pulse introduction automatic real-time motion compensation subtraction image use , know positively influence image quality . The final effect clinical image quality peripheral angiography investigate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>X-ray dose image quality relate law physic . Low dose high image quality achieve time . However , image processing algorithms help x-ray system acquire image low dose without influence image quality achieve high image quality equal dose . The primary aim study verify diagnostic image quality equal well use significant reduction X-ray dose endovascular digital subtraction angiography combination novel image technology compare use normal dose conventional image technology .</detailed_description>
