	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Measuring Effects Pazopanib Hydrochloride Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether K^trans rise nadir predictive subsequent tumor growth . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine association change mean ambulatory blood pressure measurement , K^trans , tumor size change pazopanib therapy . II . To determine association change soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( sVEGFR2 ) measurement , K^trans , tumor size change pazopanib therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore previously describe single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP 's ) pharmacogenomic biomarkers . II . To model tumor growth kinetics use radiologic tumor size measurement . III . To explore serum plasma base putative biomarkers vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway inhibition . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI baseline , day 8 , prior course 3 , 5 , 7 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
