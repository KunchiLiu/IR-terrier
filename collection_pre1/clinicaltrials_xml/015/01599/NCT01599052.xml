	<detailed_description>- Rationale : There ample evidence child treat brain tumour ( BT ) often develop deficit social emotional functioning . The investigator wish examine cause deficit , i.e . underlying neuropsychological deficit ( ) . The following expect : 1 . Children treat BT perform bad healthy control patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) measure social cognition Time 2 ( 3 year post diagnosis ) , Time 1 ( shortly diagnosis , neurotoxic treatment ) . The deterioration performance influence following adverse factor : 1 . History cranial radiation therapy ; 2 . Site lesion diencephalon ; 3 . History hydrocephalus and/or posterior fossa syndrome ; 4 . Younger age diagnosis . 2 . Parents teacher rate patient BT less socially competent experience internalize problem healthy control patient CF Time 2 , Time 1 . 3 . Performance test social cognition positively related executive function Time 1 2 . 4 . Performance test social cognition positively related parent teacher report social competence environmental biographic factor ( parental education occupation ) Time 1 2 . - Objective : To study impairment developmental delay social cognition ( related cognitive function ) cause brain damage patient treat BT childhood compare reference group chronically ill child . The focus neurocognitive basis deficit . - Study design : Comparative Non-randomised Prospective International Multi-Centre Study - Study population : 49 Children treat BT age 5-13 year , 32 child diagnose CF age 5-13 year 32 healthy control age 5-13 year .</detailed_description>
