	<brief_title>Travel Tropics Acquisition Multidrug-resistant Bacteria ( VOYAG-R )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial multidrug resistance long hospital problem . This change last decade emergence community Enterobacteriaceae produce CTX-M-type extend spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) . These enzyme produce mainly Escherichia coli , main digestive commensal bacteria Man , first causative agent community-acquired infection . These strain isolate world high community prevalence country tropic , still low industrialized country France . The steady increase international tourism create daily flux area could well major vehicle ESBL . While report Europe Enterobacteriaceae resistant almost antibiotic , include production NDM-1 carbapenemase , import Indian subcontinent urgently need control phenomenon , quantify characterize acquisition multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( MRE ) French traveler tropic . Assumptions Travel tropic source import MRE France . Population concern Adult volunteer vaccination center prior travel tropic . Main objective Measured independently three main tropical area ( Latin America , Sub-Saharan Africa Asia ) rate acquisition MRE intestinal ( production ESBL , / cephalosporinase plasmid / carbapenemase ) people return trip tropic lead early consultation vaccination center . Objective ( ) school ( ) 1 . - Comparison MRE acquisition rate traveler return visited region . 2 . - Determine risk factor acquisition MRE stay 3 . - Measure length MRE carriage return trip 4 . - To study dynamic concentration MRE digestive carrier stool 5 . - To study influence antibiotic duration carriage MRE 6 . - Estimating occurrence infection among patient MRE 7 . - To identify gene responsible multidrug resistance phenotype MRE 8 . - To assess phylogenetic relationship resistant MRE Primary endpoint The primary endpoint define presence MRE stool back travel tropic patient carrier travel . Keyword ( ) secondary assessment ( ) 1 . - Location : Asia , Sub-Saharan Africa , Latin America 2 . - Acquisition data : sex , age , socioeconomic status , diet , frequency history travel geographical area , type antimalarial prophylaxis ( compliance ) , type stay , occurrence diarrhea , intake antibiotic , contact health facility stay . 3 . - Presence MRE 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 12 month return . 4 . - Amount MRE per gram stool sample 5 . - Antibiotics ( name date take antibiotic ) send stool . 6 . - Report urinary tract infection occur MRE inclusion subject . 7 . - Presence resistance gene molecular technique ( PCR , sequence ) . 8 . - Phylogenetic relationship MRE ( Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae ) assess method multi-locus sequence typing ( MLST ) . Type study Prospective cohort study , multicenter , observational stratify sample geographical area destination ( Asia , Sub-Saharan Africa , Latin America ) . Methodology Adults consultant vaccination center one six investigator ward , prior holiday tropic approach investigator participate study . The volunteer send mail laboratory stool sample week prior departure another within 72 hour return investigate quantified MRE . Data collect investigator self-administered questionnaire establish risk factor acquire MRE stay . If positive , follow-up ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month ) undertake measure duration carriage dynamic concentration MRE stool return . The occurrence urinary tract infection MRE record . Subjects indemnify accord number sample send . Number person need To analyze dozen potential risk factor must provide 110 event . With acquisition rate estimate 20 % , 570 subject analyze need . The inclusion 750 subject , 5 % probably exclude carrier MRE trip 20 % lose sight , achieve goal 570 subject analyze . The inclusion 250 subject ( 190 analyze ) three geographical area ( Asia , Latin America , Sub-Saharan Africa ) , estimate rate acquisition zone accuracy 5 % . Inclusion Criteria - Age great 18 year - Consulting vaccination center - Travel tropic minimum 2 day maximum 90 day Key non-inclusion criterion - Pregnant woman ( known pregnancy ) breastfeed - Refusal participate study , - Accompanied subject already include , - Subject already include study , - Inability follow week follow return trip tropic . Study Schedule Phase implementation : 60 day ( September 7 November 7 , 2011 ) Inclusion period ( February 7 , 2012 February 9 , 2013 ) Follow-up period ( March 7 , 2012 May 7 , 2014 ) Period phenotypic analysis sample ( 7 February 2012 May 7 , 2014 ) Period molecular analysis sample ( 7 February 2012 May 7 , 2014 ) Analysis result ( Winter 2013-2014 ) Publication result ( second half 2014 ) Number participate center : 6 Average number inclusion per month per center : 11 Tags thesaurus DRCD09-V3 ( 3 maximum ) : Public Health Epidemiology Bacteriology Infectious Tropical An ancillary study aim make molecular analysis intestinal microbiota .</detailed_description>
