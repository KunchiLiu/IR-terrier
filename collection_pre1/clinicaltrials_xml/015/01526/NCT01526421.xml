	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , current standard care treatment HIV infection , highly effective take appropriately . Before start treatment , person must aware HIV status present clinic medical care . They undergo screen procedure ( medical assessment laboratory test ) determine whether eligible receive HAART , i.e . whether HIV treatment necessary safe . In many urban centre include Vancouver 's Downtown Eastside , high rate HIV infection among user illicit drug . However , HIV-infected drug user often present medical system complete process necessary start HAART . Given known benefit HAART , new strategy require increase rate HAART initiation group . Contingency management ( CM ) strategy affect behaviour provide reward ( e.g . money ) reinforce desire behaviour . CM use success area medicine ( e.g . smoke cessation , weight loss ) drug use population , establish mean improve HAART uptake . The propose research primarily seek assess effectiveness monetary-based CM engage HIV-infected drug user HAART program . Drug user identify outreach randomize 1:1 ratio one two arm ; participant one arm offer monetary-based reinforcer participate ( n=150 ) participant second arm offer reinforcer ( n=150 ) . Participation involve report study site formal study eligibility screening , consist clinical evaluation , medical history laboratory testing require determine eligibility receive HAART . Participants randomize reinforcer arm receive gift card completion screening procedure . Our hypothesis drug user offer monetary-based reinforcer significantly likely complete HAART eligibility screening offer reinforcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HAART eligibility screen entail present study site within 2 week pre-screening , undergoing laboratory test provide medical history , return result within subsequent four week . Any potential subject appear acutely intoxicated ask return next day later date time choose . All participant ask return result within four week screen . Subjects 70 mL whole blood collected venipuncture train study nurse . Laboratory test include HIV confirmatory test ( antibody Western blot ) , CD4 cell count plasma HIV-1-RNA level ( plasma viral load ; pVL ) , Hepatitis A , B C serology , pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential , complete blood count ( CBC ) differential platelet count , chemistry profile ( creatinine , urea electrolyte ) , transaminase level ( ALT , AST ) . All participant also medical history take undergo physical examination . Recorded data include subject gender , age , ethnicity , race , area residence living arrangement ( categorize homeless/on street , unstable [ define live primarily single room occupancy hotel , board room , transition house ] stable ) . Additional feature record include nature frequency illicit substance use , participation cohort study methadone maintenance program . All clinical past medical history co-morbidities laboratory data record assessment subject HAART eligibility . All subject return result , whether HAART-eligible , laboratory result explain counseled recommended course clinical care study nurse . Those eligible HAART offer enrollment Part II study . Those eligible HAART invite re-evaluate eligibility antiretroviral therapy yearly interval study site . Once 150 subject randomize two study arm ( total n=300 ) , recruitment temporarily halt statistical analysis determine whether reinforcer result significant clinically relevant increase proportion subject complete HAART eligibility screening .</detailed_description>
