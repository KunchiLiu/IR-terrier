	<brief_title>Assessment Platelet Rich Fibrin Efficiency Healing Delay Jawbone Osteochemonecrosis Provoked Bisphosphonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Context Bisphosphonates ( BP ) work slow bone remodelling . They use management different type cancer treatment osteoporosis . Recent study warn drug could produce adverse effect jawbone .In December 2007 , AFSSAPS ( French agency Sanitary Security Health Products ) alert health professional risk spontaneous induced osteonecrosis follow invasive odontological procedure patient receive BP . Prevalence osteonecrosis vary 6 % 10 % surgical intervention . A healing delay estimate 20 25 % case frequently precede occurrence osteochemonecrosis . On whole , total rate complication amount 30 % . We extremely limit term prevention treatment OCN patient . We intend study biological autologous sediment obtain blood sample capacity avoid complication supervene . The collection coagulum call Platelet Rich Fibrin PRF susceptible provide essential ingredient mucous membrane bone healing obtain centrifugation . This biomaterial rich autologous fibrin concentrate leukocyte , platelet number factor favour cicatrisation immune response . Clinical application already well document orthopaedic , thoracic cardiac surgery , also dermatology . The use PRF dental surgery recent . Literature topic limit new technique give rise high hope . Since February 2007 , thanks classification medical treatment AFSSAPS , PRF technique authorize . Objectives To appraise dental avulsion PRF efficiency prevent delay cicatrisation jawbone osteochemonecrosis induce BP . This efficiency assess retroalveolar X-ray perform visit . The main criterion evaluation discovery cicatrisation delay week 8 and/or osteochemonecrosis follow . Material method Studied population : current previous patient treat BP refer dental avulsion . General experimental procedure : A prospective , longitudinal , multicentric , randomize open study . Patients randomize two group : dental avulsion dental avulsion PRF . For group initial management surgical ( bone curettage + PRF PRF group ) .The follow spread one year 10 visit . Each patient undergo clinical photographic examination complete radiological check ( OPT ) , standard biological blood test ( blood count haemogram ( NFS ) thorough calculation quantity BP administer . The appearance OCN delay cicatrisation document histological biopsy , bacteriological swab test X-ray . The requisite number patient : 270 patient require validate expect objective study . Their recruitment take place 4 establishment : Metz-Thionville CHR ( Regional Central Hospital ) three university teach hospital ( CHU ) Dijon , Nancy Reims . Total Duration study : The estimated total duration 3 year : 2 year recruitment 1 year follow-up . Expected result prospect To prove interest use PRF therapy able prevent delay cicatrization OCN induce BP .</detailed_description>
