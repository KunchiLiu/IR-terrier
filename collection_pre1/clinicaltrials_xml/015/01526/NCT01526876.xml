	<brief_summary>Patients acute brain injury risk complication increase pressure brain ( intracranial pressure , ICP ) , decrease blood flow , bleeding , brain swelling ( cerebral edema ) . Several study suggest high blood pressure associate worsen outcome possibly due increase rate continue bleed rebleeding , well increase brain swelling ( cerebral edema ) . High systemic ( body ) blood pressure ( SBP ) may also increase risk ongoing bleeding . Therefore lower blood pressure ( BP ) critical , continue bleed occurs frequently patient high BP . Clevidipine Butyrate ( Cleviprex ) new medication approve FDA treatment acute high blood pressure ( hypertension ) . Cleviprex give intravenous line ( IV ) benefit faster act easy control adjustment drug use treat high BP . Patients acute brain injury severe high BP may benefit faster act medication . For study , eligible patient , 18 yr age old , admit Neurocritical care unit within 24 hour brain injury , high systemic ( body ) SBP . The treating physician already multimodality brain monitoring place clinical management patient ( standard care ) . The investigator use Cleviprex low SBP record brain pressure brain blood flow measurement multimodality monitoring . Due severity brain injury patient eligible study unable provide consent . Informed consent seek surrogate ( family member , spouse close friend ) accord CUMC guideline . Cleviprex fast acting effect see 90 second . The medication start low rate , SBP still need lowering , dose increase every 90 second maximum FDA approve dose reach . If SBP still high , another medication use treat high blood pressure add ( Cardene labetolol ) . Once SBP lower stable , Cleviprex continue 6 hour . As part standard care , patient blood pressure monitor continuously . After 6 hour treat physician make determination continue clinical management cleviprex another antihypertensive medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Clevidipine Intracranial Pressure Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ( CCP ) Brain Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , single center study patient hypertension set acute brain injury . Approximately 15 patient admit Columbia University Neurocritical Care Unit intracerebral hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage traumatic brain injury hypertensive neuromonitoring probe place course standard clinical management enrol 10-12 month period . Patients must hypertensive ( SBP &gt; 180mmHg ) , elevate cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP , 100 mm Hg ) decision make ICU team initiate infusion clevidipine maintain CPP within target range 70-90 mm Hg SBP 120-180mmHg . Due decrease level consciousness injury , majority patient unable provide consent . Informed consent seek surrogate accord Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) guideline ( See section 8-Informed Consent Process ) . Clevidipine infusion use treat hypertension within first 24 hour injury . Multi-modality brain monitoring place standard care . Clevidipine infused initial rate 2.0 mg/h first 90 second titrated effect ( CPP target range 70-90 mm Hg ) either double reduce dose 50 % every 90 second ( dose range 0-32mg/h continuous IV infusion ) . At end 6 hour clevidipine treatment , treat physician make determination continue clinical management clevidipine change another antihypertensive medication . Patients monitor 24 hour infusion liver function , triglycerides lipase .</detailed_description>
