	<brief_summary>Approximately 5−10 % people asthma respond standard therapy refer difficult asthma . Evidence show poor response always relate asthma severity non−adherence treatment recognize common underlying problem , 35 % patient . Recognising non−adherence clinic problematic straightforward objective test identify . Previous study demonstrate up-regulation FKBP51 gene expression follow treatment steroid , make potential biomarker steroid exposure . It therefore also potential biomarker non-adherence inhaled corticosteroid therapy . The investigator plan assess feasibility distinguish non-adherent subject omission steroid naïve adherent subject , steroid expose subject use FKBP51 gene expression sputum throat swab . To investigator obtain throat swab sputum sample healthy volunteer , steroid naïve asthmatic adherent asthmatic high dose ICS ass FKBP51 gene expression comparable group . The investigator compare FKBP51 gene expression response directly observe inhaled steroid therapy steroid naïve , non-adherent adherent asthmatic . This identify response gene expression distinguishes steroid expose ( adherent ) steroid naïve ( non-adherent ) patient . Identifying non-adherence benefit patient enable appropriate tailored management non-adherence enhance treatment effectiveness . It also identify patient therapy resistant asthma unmet need may benefit expensive novel therapy Omalizumab .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This pilot study investigate follow group ( n=10 per group ) : 1 . Healthy volunteer . 2 . Steroid naïve asthmatic . 3 . Refractory asthmatic adherent high dose inhale steroid . 4 . Nonadherent asthmatic . Inclusion Criteria For inclusion study participant must : 16 year old old give write informed consent Healthy volunteer must : good general health determine past medical history physical . significant medical history specifically prior history asthma persistent respiratory symptom . normal spirometry . Steroid naïve subject diagnosis asthma receive treatment Step 1 BTS/SIGN Guidelines i.e . inhale steroid Nonadherent subject must diagnosis asthma nonadherent ICS determine ICS prescription fill &lt; /=50 % previous 6 month Refractory asthmatic adherent subject must : diagnosis asthma receive high dose ICS treatment ( beclomethasone equivalent dose &gt; 1000 µg per day ) adherent ICS determine ICS prescription fill &gt; 75 % previous 6 month Participants fulfill follow criterion exclude study entry : Current smoker , Pregnant lactating , Other significant respiratory disease Previous allergic reaction know hypersensitivity budesonide corticosteroid Healthy volunteer exclude / : significant medical history principal investigator ( PI ) deem appropriate exclude healthy control group obstructive lung function take medication current history drug alcohol abuse significant illness screen period precede entry study Steroid naïve / Nonadherent asthmatic exclude : commenced increase oral corticosteroid previous 28 day concurrent asthma exacerbation Refractory / Adherent asthmatic exclude : commence increased oral corticosteroid previous 28 day concurrent asthma exacerbation</criteria>
