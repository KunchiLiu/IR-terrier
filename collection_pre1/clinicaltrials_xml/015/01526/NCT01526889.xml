	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize , active-controlled , open-label study . Approximately 24 patient active , non-infectious intermediate- , posterior- , panuveitis require systemic immunosuppressive therapy enrol . Safety , efficacy , PK assessments occur schedule visit 12-week period . Low-molecular-weight non-steroidal immunosuppressive medication allow baseline day long dose change 3 week prior baseline , except corticosteroid dos may change . Patients respond treatment offer 6 month extend tretment Assessments safety include laboratory safety test , ECGs , physical exam , ocular exam , vital sign monitor adverse event .

	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Intravitreal LFG316 Patients With Active Non-infectious Intermediate- , posterior-or Panuveitis ,</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 24 patient active non-infectious uveitis , least one eye , require intensification systemic immunosuppressive therapy enrol randomized receive intravitreal LFG316 conventional therapy ( investigator 's discretion ) . Only one eye ( study eye ) treat LFG316 eye ( fellow eye ) treat investigator 's discretion.Throughout study , fellow eye may treat need ; except certain systemic medication prohibit There 1 screen 8 schedule visit 85 day total 9 site visit patient . At Day 85 , patient receive LFG316 treatment meet criterion 'responder ' , offer additional 6 month LFG316 treatment PRN basis . Additional 3 schedule visit attend LFG316-responder patient extension period . However , patient unscheduled visit need determined investigator . Safety evaluation ocular assessment perform throughout study duration . Patients treatment extension phase , experience flare post last dose require treatment , may receive dose LFG316 . These patient assess response next PRN visit schedule investigator . Visit frequency determine investigator . If continue respond LFG316 therapy , may remain PRN treatment arm . They may receive 7 additional dos LFG316 PRN period . Throughout trial LFG316 administer frequently monthly . Patients extension phase , discontinue treatment prematurely ask return approximately 1 month last dose . Low molecular weight non-steroidal immunosuppressive medication allow baseline day long dose change 3 week prior baseline , except corticosteroid dos may change .</detailed_description>
