	<brief_title>Cohera TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive Management Wound Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fluid accumulation dissect tissue plane longstanding problem follow surgical procedure . The common use close suction drain associate infection risk , wound heal complication , additional scarring , patient discomfort . Additionally , seroma formation drain removal often require invasive treatment . Therapies reduce fluid accumulation decrease need drain positive impact surgical practice . Objectives : - To establish use TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive safe effective alternative drain ( standard care ) fluid management follow abdominoplasty . - To evaluate impact TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive post-operative invasive treatment , seroma formation . - To evaluate impact TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive post-operative subject satisfaction quality life . - To document type duration adverse event associate TissuGlu® use abdominoplasty procedure alternative drain . Material Methods : A prospective randomize trial compare standard wound closure technique drain 130 subject ( control group n=65 ) standard wound closure technique plus TissuGlu® drain ( test group n=65 ) Abdominoplasty . For subject randomized Test Group , TissuGlu® apply one surface expose tissue flap use custom applicator standard abdominoplasty procedure follow normal wound closure ( suture technique ) without drain placement . The applicator device deliver array drop space equidistant apart . The user may reposition device next area repeat application process . Each device dispense approximately 5 ml adhesive . It expect one 5 ml device suffice average size subject ( 400-500 sq cm tissue flap ) . The TissuGlu® apply use disposable applicator tissue surface adhere prior standard closure . The tissue approximate , wound close use standard suture technique . TissuGlu® begin cure upon exposure moisture tissue . The cure process take approximately 30-45 minute . Subjects randomize Control Group undergo normal wound closure ( suture technique ) placement two size 12 Blake drain .</detailed_description>
