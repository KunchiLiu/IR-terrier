	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate safety efficacy mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) treatment patient develop extensive chronic graft versus host disease ( skin and/or liver damage ) HSCs transplantation respond first-line therapy . The secondary purpose study evaluate effect mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) one-year survival rate , long-term survival rate , life quality recurrence patient develop extensive chronic graft versus host disease ( skin and/or liver damage ) HSCs transplantation respond hormone treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cells Patients With Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ï¼Œ incidence 30 % -60 % , serious late complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) major cause death late stage transplantation . According targeted organ , cGVHD divide two type , limit cGVHD extensive cGVHD . Extensive cGVHD need systemic immunosuppressant treatment . However , currently standard first-line regimen include cyclophosphamide prednisolone effective patient . Novel treatment urgently need . Our previous study show mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) effective cGVHD patient multiple skin damage . To explore therapeutic effect MSCs extensive cGVHD , plan conduct multi-center clinical trial . Patients develop extensive cGVHD ( skin and/or liver damage ) HSCs transplantation respond first-line therapy enrol . They randomly divide two group receive MSCs routine second-line drug respectively . We evaluate efficacy safety MSCs extensive cGVHD comparison symptom improvement , survival rate , recurrence well side effect two group .</detailed_description>
