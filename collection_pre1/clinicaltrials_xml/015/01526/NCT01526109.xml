	<brief_summary>Quality Life ( Qol ) complex concept relate perception subjective satisfaction , especially elderly population . It also relate self-perception psychological status , independence level , social relationship , environment elderly person life . Consequently , number factor may change perception QoL , namely occurrence disease , physical impairment incapacity , rupture social relationship , well age process . Physical exercise associate improvement mental physical health . However , study investigate effect strength train whole- body vibration train elderly subject . Following line reason , purpose present study assess effect physical exercise cognition functional ability elderly subject . Design : Randomized controlled trial , double-blinded , 12-week follow-up . Setting : Gama Filho University . Participants : Healthy Elderly . Interventions : The patient randomly assign strength training group ( STG ) , whole-body vibration training group ( WBVG ) control group ( CG ) . Main outcome measure : Cognitive function assess use Mini Metal State Examination ( MMSE ) , Trail A B , Digit Span , Stroop Test , Rey auditory-verbal learn test Clock Test , functional capacity evaluate use Senior Fitness Test , American Alliance Health , Physical Education , Recreation &amp; Dance ( AAHPERD ) functional fitness test , Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) health survey .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Three-month controlled , randomize , double-blind study . The subject recruit Gama Filho University . They randomize blind design whole-body vibration training group ( WBV ) , strength training group ( STG ) control group ( CG ) researcher participate initial assessment . Intervention The study longitudinal randomize clinical trial . The subject perform three visit laboratory submit neuropsychological , behavioral physical evaluation . These evaluation perform three month train . Each visit last hour half . After period one week adaptation , subject begin train charge set study . All group carry train twice week , forty minute , three month . Next , describe detail experimental procedure group : STG Group Participants undergo training program set three functional group , last ten minute , follow thirty minute strength training twice week consist six exercise major muscle group : leg press , bench press , lat pull , knee extension , knee flexion Abdominal ( 3 set 10-12 repetition 60-80 % 1 RM 3 min interval set workout ) . WBV Group Participants undergo training program set three functional group , last ten minute , follow thirty minute exercise stimuli whole-body vibration training twice week ( 2-3 set 30 sec . frequency stimulation 30 Hz 60 interval stimuli ) , platform hold range six functional exercise combine squat isometric dynamic exercise upper limb trunk . Control Group Participants undergo training program set three functional group ten minute duration , follow thirty minute functional exercise twice week ( 2-3 set 30 sec . At interval 60 stimulus ) carry range six functional exercise combine squat isometric dynamic exercise upper limb trunk without intensity .</detailed_description>
