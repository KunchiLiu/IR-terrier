	<brief_summary>Purpose : Grapefruit juice one extensively studied dietary/natural substance show interact variety medication . However , unanswered question remain regard causative ingredient mechanisms underlie drug-grapefruit juice interaction . Compounds grapefruit juice call furanocoumarins establish major causative ingredient , act inhibit elimination ( metabolism ) drug , lead increased circulate drug concentration . Increased drug concentration turn lead increase drug potency even toxicity . Grapefruit juice also show , paradoxically , decrease circulate concentration drug , include non-sedating antihistamine agent , fexofenadine ( Allegra ) , undergoes negligible metabolism . Whether furanocoumarins mediate decrease fexofenadine concentration unknown . The purpose propose study compare effect `` furanocoumarin-free '' grapefruit juice grapefruit juice circulate concentration fexofenadine .</brief_summary>
