	<brief_title>Improving Learning-based Treatment Cocaine Dependence With Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence public health problem substantial morbidity , however effective pharmacotherapy cocaine dependence approve FDA . Unlike previous medication study seek pharmacologically reduce cocaine reinforcement , seek craving , exploratory clinical trial test d-cycloserine ( DCS ) ability improve learning-based behavioral treatment cocaine dependence . DCS NMDA partial agonist show robustly improve learn preclinical model , include extinction cocaine condition place preference blockade cocaine reacquisition , improve extinction-learning base exposure therapy multiple anxiety disorder . This Phase II clinical trial investigate pharmacological ( DCS ) enhancement behavioral treatment combine contingency management ( CM ) novel home-environment exposure therapy session cocaine dependence . High magnitude CM incentive use promote cocaine abstinence necessary extinction home-based exposure session . Participants randomize 2 group : 1 . CM placebo ( CM+PL ) , 2 . CM DCS ( CM+DCS ) . For 19 day group assignment , participant report laboratory 3 time per week ( Mon , Wed , Fri ) provide urine sample , receive contingent voucher , complete assessment drug use , craving , mood , withdrawal , quit self-efficacy . DCS ( 50 mg ) placebo administer Mon , Wed Fri study visit ( end lab visit return home environment exposure session time DCS action ) . Follow-up visit conduct 1 week , 1 month , 3 month post-CM completion , time measure drug use ( self-reported urinalysis ) , crave , mood , withdrawal obtain . Comparison continuous abstinence post-CM group primary outcome measure . During initial laboratory session , battery learning/cognitive task test form learning/cognition enhance DCS might contribute treatment effect . This project test efficacy novel intervention cocaine dependence develop base know efficacious cocaine dependence treatment ( CM ) , principles extinction learn theory , medication show improve preclinical learn general , include extinction cocaine conditioning , clinical learning-based exposure treatment anxiety disorder . The study may indicate cost effective addition ( home exposure session DCS ) extend CM benefit removal contingency , therefore may increase dissemination CM community setting .</detailed_description>
