	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluating The Utility Transnasal Endoscopy With Roux en Y Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic United States effect 250 million people worldwide 30 % population United Sates . Medical therapy obesity lack durability maintain weight loss . Currently surgical therapy dependable durable treatment option . The Roux en Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) initially described 1967 currently surgical method choice treatment obesity . It involve creation small gastric pouch restrict gastric body antrum creation long roux limb gastrojejunal anastomosis , thus induce satiety create malabsorptive physiology . Unfortunately procedure maintains significant complication rate . Strictures gastrojejunal anastomosis occur 6-20 % patient bypass.1 Anastomotic ulcer occur 16 % .2 Symptoms include vomit , abdominal pain , significant nausea . Unfortunately symptoms specific stricture ulcer may occur spontaneously without specific etiology , often transoral upper endoscopy ( EGD ) require evaluate anastomosis significant pathology . EGD post bariatric patient safe procedure . However typically require deep sedation administer anesthesiologist overcome patient 's gag reflex discomfort . Sedation obese patient challenge due risk apnea challenge tracheal intubation . For procedure perform patient must take day work bring driver take home , thus significant direct indirect cost procedure . Improvements image technology allow development small endoscope ( `` slim scope '' ) half size typical endoscope . These small endoscope pass transnasally esophagus stomach local anesthesia nasal passage without need deep sedation . They use detection disease esophagus stomach,3,4 use detection complication post bariatric population</detailed_description>
