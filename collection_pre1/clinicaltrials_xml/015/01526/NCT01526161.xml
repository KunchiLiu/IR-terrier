	<brief_summary>Asthma affect 1 8 child UK . Up half treat preventative medicine form low-dose steroid use inhaler . The National Asthma Treatment Guidelines recommend treatment work treatment start . Studies support take place adults child . If patient instruct use inhaler give information asthma , control disease much well . The first part study , last 4 week , make sure child family understand use inhaler . All child give steroid inhaler use 4 week still symptoms enter study proper last 48 week . During part study child give one three treatment . These : - steroid inhaler + dummy tablet , inhaler contain steroid long-acting reliever + dummy tablet steroid inhaler + active tablet . In way patient , family researcher know three treatment child take code broken end study . What matter child feel , able run around play friend well enough go school . The investigator assess treatment best allow happen ask parent child fill questionnaires 4 occasion study . The investigator also see treatment best prevents need short course steroid tablet study . These commonly give asthma symptom worsen . Most child start study general practitioner clinic . It take one year enroll 900 child . Once enrolled child followed-up hospital centre . Much funding require recruit follow-up child , train everyone standard develop administer questionnaire health economic assessment . Asthma care expensive . The investigator look cost assess treatment offer benefit . The team experience ability field ensure result well publicised . Any child withdraw study time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma remain common medical condition see child primary care frequent cause medical paediatric hospital admission . It affect 1 8 child nationwide , approximately 50 % prescribed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . When treatment low-dose ICS fails control asthma symptom , National Guidelines suggest ensure compliance , maximise inhaler technique give appropriate information disease child family . Once measure establish asthma symptom persist , Guidelines recommend change treatment ( Step 3 National Guidelines ) . The evidence step Guidelines much weak child adult . The reason study undertake child take place use adult-based outcome lung function measurement . This unsatisfactory know chronic disease entity asthma child much variable adult period symptom , lung function often normal . Pharmaceutical company study really conduct part requirement obtain license market product . These study generally short-term duration . They add clinician ' understanding use medication . They necessarily select representative population due entry criterion intensive study requirement . Such requirement mean `` real-life‟ compliance occur . In independent National Dutch Study attempt enter patient uncontrolled low-dose ICS , three treatment group employ : inhaled corticosteroid alone , inhaled corticosteroid double dose inhaled corticosteroid + long-acting beta2 agonist . There essentially difference outcome measure three treatment group primary outcome measure lung function ( FEV1 ) . Comparing study similar adult study6 use lung function primary outcome measure , mean FEV1 entry paediatric study approximately 89 % expect children‟s height . In adult study mean FEV1 entry study 74 % expect . It therefore surprising paediatric study unable show difference treatment group . We scientific information treat child asthma well control low-dose ICS therapy . It use recommend low-dose ICS effective dose double . Studies child , however , investigated statement result impressive7 . There scientific evidence control poor child asthma , dose inhaled steroid increase . We therefore decide introduce study treatment limb high ICS dosage . There anecdotal information , however , many study undertake within pharmaceutical industry child enter study control double-blind nature , 30 % improve , symptom reduce lung function increases8 . It therefore surprising approximately one third child receive ICS prescribe high-dose inhaled steroid therapy ( ≥ 800micrograms unlicensed beclometasone dipropionate equivalent ) commence `` add-on‟ therapy long-acting beta2 agonist ( LABA ) leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) addition low-dose ICS . Concerns safety high-dose ICS raise relation growth impairment9 , hypoglycaemia10 suppression adrenal cortex11 result warning prescribe Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) UK12 Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) USA . It therefore unacceptable approximately one third child asthma treat regime . Asthma common condition worth regime proven appropriately devise paediatric study . The National Guidelines develop `` stepwise‟ manner , amount medication increase step symptom control . However , state , may childhood asthma differs adult . It seem relatively poorly control asthma child exhibit frequent symptom necessarily show abnormal lung function period symptom . It reason study concentrate outcome measure exacerbation quality life although opportunity measure spirometric value first ( T0 ) last ( T48 ) visit randomise part study . It could increase medication may need short time child asthma suggestion control achieve child add-on therapy review . To incorporate step within present study would make excessively complicate would major implication number patient include . The inclusion step would make study impractical within UK . A study need simple , pragmatic ( placebo-controlled double-blinded ) , outcomes practical benefit child provide evidence use add-on medication cost effective efficient way . Children dislike exacerbation . School attendance , daily activity general well-being increase asthma well control . Once family understand sufficiently asthma , inhaler technique evaluate optimised , compliance issue address , one reason specific medication may less effective could relate genetic make-up patient . In study opportunity , separate consent process , collect store DNA specimens saliva later analysis specific genetic polymorphism relation asthma severity outcome . This aspect bring add value study .</detailed_description>
