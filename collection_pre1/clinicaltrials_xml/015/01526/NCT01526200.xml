	<detailed_description>Contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound ( CE-IOUS ) surgery colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) enter clinical practice . However , impact seem decrease improvement preoperative imaging . Therefore , CE-IOUS selectively routinely apply remain unclear : profile patient may benefit CE-IOUS application disclose . The aim study define reliable criterion selective use CE-IOUS surgery CLM . IOUS perform use 3-6 MHz convex probe , 7.5-10 MHz micro convex probe . Staging complete CE-IOUS use standard 3-6 MHz convex probe dedicate 1.88-3.76 MHz harmonic frequency probe . In patient , 2.4 mL sulphur-hexafluoride microbubbles ( SonoVueÂ® , Bracco , Milan , Italy ) inject peripheral vein anesthesiologist . Ultrasound guidance use drive dissection plane previously describe . Reference standard histology image 6 month surgery . Univariate multivariate analysis perform . Statistical significance set P=0.05 .</detailed_description>
