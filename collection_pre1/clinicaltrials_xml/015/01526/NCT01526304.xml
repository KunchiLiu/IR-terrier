	<brief_title>The Role Of FGF23 , Klotho , And Sclerostin In Kidney Stone Formers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney stone common industrialized country lifetime risk 10 15 % population . Men affect woman mean age patient be-tween fourth sixth decade life . Notably , considerable percentage patient experience recurrent kidney stone relapse rate 50 % 5-10 year complicate pain urinary tract infection potential loss functional renal parenchyma development chronic renal failure long term . Kidney stone compose inorganic organic component . Calcium contain stone common stone type account 80 % kidney stone . Many factor predispose contribute development kidney stone , include genetic variant mutation , diet , environmental factor , behavior . Among factor , abnormal urinary pH calcium excretion predominant finding stone former seem play major role pathogenesis stone formation ( 1-5 ) . Moreover , significant percentage patient calcium nephrolithiasis normal parathyroid function show hypophosphatemia reduce renal phosphate reabsorption i.e . renal phosphate leak ( 6-8 ) result hyperphosphaturia . To date , little know fibroblast growth factor ( FGF23 ) level patient calcium nephrolithiasis ( 6 ) . The author demonstrate FGF23 increase stone former renal phosphate leak compare control . Also serum FGF23 concentration strongly inversely associate serum phosphate level rate tubular phosphate re-absorption , respectively . This study suggest role FGF23 pathogenesis calcium nephrolithiasis , however , study necessary confirm finding . More , influence novel factor involve hyperphosphaturia identify yet , Klotho . FGF23 crucial phosphate homeostasis include physiological pathophysiological condition X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets seem FGF23 probably important regulator serum phosphate calcitriol ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) level addition parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) produce parathyroid gland ( 9-13 ) . FGF23 produce osteocyte osteoblast , secrete response phosphate , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 , bind FGF receptor ( FGFR ) /Klotho complex , act phosphaturic hormone reduce expression sodium dependent phosphate cotransporters , namely NaPi2a NaPi2c renal proximal tubule cell ( 14 ) . There evidence PTH induce expression secretion FGF23 hand FGF23 decrease 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 production thus stimulate PTH production . In chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient , FGF23 involve CKD-related mineral bone disorder ( CKD-MBD ) show independent probably critical cardiovascular risk factor phosphate ( 14 ) . Novel factor Klotho Sclerostin , involve bone-kidney-parathyroid endocrine axis , identify recently . Klotho putative age suppressor gene deficiency result osteopenia , hyperphosphaturia , calcification . Klotho mainly express kidney also parathyroid gland act FGF23 specific co-receptor mediating FGF23 participation bone-kidney-parathyroid endocrine axis describe . Interestingly , secrete Klotho also able induce phosphaturia independently FGF23 ( 15 ) . Sclerostin protein secrete osteocyte inhibits bone formation osteoblast . Deficiency Sclerostin cause van Buchem disease sclerosteosis , rare sclerosing bone disorder , respectively . Interestingly , human , Sclerostin mRNA express several tissue , high level kidney whereas Sclerostin protein restrict osteocyte . The exclusive effect Sclerostin bone formation deficiency cause bone disorder suggest potential role molecule also diseases bone homeostasis may disarrange nephrolithiasis ( 16-18 ) . However , potential role FGF23 , Klotho , Sclerostin nephrolithiasis still poorly under-stood even unexplored . The aim study test level FGF23 , Klotho , Sclerostin differentially regulate kidney stone former . Given large number kidney stone patient worldwide , good understand pathogenesis kidney disease may provide basis design individualize specifically targeted therapeutic patient cohort .</detailed_description>
