	<brief_title>Patient-Reported Outcomes With LASIK : PROWL-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LASIK Quality Life Collaboration Project ( LQOLCP ) government partnership among FDA , Department Defense , National Eye Institute ( NEI ) . This project examine patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) follow LASIK . This three-phased project part FDA 's ongoing effort well monitor improve safety effectiveness laser use LASIK surgery . PROWL-1 second phase large LQOLCP project . This prospective , questionnaire-based study conduct Navy Refractive Surgery Center San Diego collaboration U.S. Food Drug Administration 's ( FDA 's ) Center Devices Radiological Health ( CDRH ) National Eye Institute ( NEI ) . The primary purpose study explore psychometric property newly develop questionnaire assess satisfaction ophthalmic-related quality life ( QOL ) 550 active duty patient period six month prior follow state-of-the-art laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) . Specific topics interest include : functional limitation , dry eye symptom , pre-operative expectation , depression , anxiety , post-operative symptom , dispositional optimism , satisfaction . Additionally , standard-of-care , non-invasive clinical data collect pre- postoperatively ( e.g. , best correct visual acuity , manifest refraction , wavefront aberrometry , corneal topography , clinical assessment ) , analyze . The questionnaire study newly develop instrument , psychometrically evaluate U.S. Navy/FDA/NEI collaboration , used future large-scale , multicenter FDA clinical study include civilian refractive surgery center throughout United States .</detailed_description>

Previous introcular corneal surgery kind either eye , include type surgery either refractive therapeutic purpose . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding , intend become pregnant 6 month duration study . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane ) , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone ) sumatriptin ( Imitrex ) tryptan . Active ophthalmic disease , neovascularization cornea within 1 mm intend ablation zone , clinically significant lens opacity , clinically significant dry eye syndrome unresolved treatment . Evidence glaucoma intraocular pressure great 22mmHg baseline . Evidence keratonconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . Corneal thickness insufficient allow residual remain stromal bed le 300 micron eye . The residual stromal bed thickness determine subtract LASIK flap thickness depth ablation total central corneal thickness measure pachymetry . History recurrent erosion epithelial basement dystrophy . Patients know sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course .</criteria>
