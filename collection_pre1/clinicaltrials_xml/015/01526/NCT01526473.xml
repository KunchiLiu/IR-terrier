	<brief_summary>HER2 protein express 20-30 % breast cancer . It also find associate lung , gastric , ovarian , pancreatic cancer . Although exist therapy target HER2 , patient eventually experience progression disease even though cancer continue express HER2 . Therefore , new approach need treat tumor express HER2 . This clinical trial use investigational cancer vaccine call HER2 VRP AVX901 . The vaccine base virus call Venezuelan equine encephalitis change cause active infection . Instead , virus change tell immune system attack cancer cell make HER2 . The objective study evaluate safety immunization HER2 VRP patient advance metastatic malignancy express HER2 , test whether immunization cause strong immune system attack cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study To Evaluate The Antitumor Activity And Safety Of AVX901</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic breast cancer continue account 400,000 death yearly HER2 positive breast cancer represent approximately one third case . Despite efficacy trastuzumab HER2 overexpressing breast cancer , progression metastatic disease inevitable . Lapatinib , combine capecitabine , improve time progression trastuzumab resistant disease , lapatinib resistance also develop majority patient . HER2 overexpression also report lung , gastric , ovarian , pancreatic cancer , also need improve treatment option . Because HER2 continue express patient refractory disease , use immune-targeting approach HER2 remain promising strategy . A number clinical trial confirm ability vaccine activate T cell antibody responses HER2 . We propose use propagation-defective , single-cycle , RNA replicon vector system express HER2 antigen-specific cancer vaccine Phase I clinical trial patient advance metastatic malignancy express HER2 . The vaccine prepare attenuate strain alphavirus 3 7 viral gene remove replace HER2 gene create self-amplifying RNA ( replicon ) express large amount HER2 . The HER2 gene use include extracellular domain ( ECD ) transmembrane ( TM ) region HER2 ICD region . The HER2 ECDTM replicon package virus-like replicon particle ( VRP ) provide alphavirus structural protein separate RNA molecule . When VRP use immunization , VRP infect individual cell replicon express HER2 induces immune response . The primary objective study evaluate safety immunization HER2 ECDTM VRP patient advance metastatic HER2-expressing malignancy . The study also monitor immune response HER2 . Preliminary data tumor response rate also collect .</detailed_description>

( iii ) Other histologically confirm metastatic ( stage IV ) locally recurrent ( stage III ) ( 7th Edition AJCC TNM System ) malignancy HER2/neu overexpression immunohistochemistry ( 2+,3+ ) FISH+ . Because malignancy FDA approve HER2 target therapy , prior HER2 direct therapy require subgroup . However , patient require least 1 line therapy know survival benefit malignancy .
