	<brief_summary>Patients melanoma , rare skin cancer , cancer penis scrotum cancer spread lymph node upper part leg , call groin . Medically , area call inguinal area . At present , melanomas skin cancer type spread usually find special test call `` sentinel lymph node biopsy '' . This procedure find spread even cell single lymph nodeâ€”allowing treat doctor find spread early . Treatment patient skin cancer lymph node area remove lymph node area . In patient cancer penis scrotum hot evidence cancer spread either physical examination radiology test , lymph node area remove check see cancer . This call staging . At present , standard way remove lymph node groin large incision , approximately 8-10 inch length . For patient operation , high incidence infection surgery : many 50 % patient problem surgery . These infection range low grade skin infection need oral antibiotic deep infection require wound open occasionally need readmission hospital antibiotic give via vein . With advent new technology new equipment , ability perform procedure small incision away groin leg become possible . This procedure never perform routinely compare side side standard open approach . The investigator propose perform protocol two phase . The investigator perform procedure 20 groin point confirm number lymph node visually verified procedure identical open procedure . The investigator perform procedure order insure investigator offer equivalent option regardless procedure patient randomize . The study involve randomization patient undergoing procedure . The investigator randomize next 110 patient 2:1 fashion ( two people get videoscopic procedure every one get open procedure ) 73 patient include video arm 37 open arm . Outcomes include recurrence rate , duration drain requirement , incidence lymphedema follow . Patients follow use standard care process , include regular office visit , physical exam , radiographic imaging , indicate . Patients follow 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Videoscopic Versus Open Inguinal Lymphadenectomy Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal lymphadenectomy standard procedure use treat patient metastatic lymphadenopathy groin . For melanoma , majority patient diagnose via sentinel lymph node biopsy , identifies disease early stage . In 80 % patient additional disease identify lymphadenectomy specimen1,2 , perform separate set initial biopsy , unlike breast cancer . Unfortunately , due nature incision location , inguinal lymphadenectomy associate extremely high incidence postoperative wound complication . As many 50 % patient develop wound infection range simple cellulitis significant wound abscesses require reopen incision considerable wound care , sometimes necessitate rehospitalization.3 These data associate open procedure , generally require 10-15 cm incision . Recently , videoscopic approach procedure described.4 It well-proven minimally invasive approach cancer surgery negative impact outcomes cancer treatment.5 Emory long forefront minimally invasive surgery appropriate investigator continue lead field . As one busy melanoma center country , investigator opportunity demonstrate utility approach continue lead field cancer therapy minimally invasive surgery . The trial randomize patient either videoscopic open lymphadenectomy determine difference wound complication rate secondary endpoint , time recurrence . It expect substantial ( approximately 25 % incidence versus traditional 50 % incidence half number wound complication ) decrease incidence wound complication minimally invasive lymphadenectomy . This expect predominantly two reason : 1 . The wound procedure outside groin , contrast locate thigh , less difficult area healing ; 2 . The wound markedly short length , make wound heal easy . The investigator would expect recurrence pattern identical two group . The investigator perform 20 procedure use minimally invasive approach , experience point demonstrate mean median number node harvest 9 10.5 respectively . Median procedure duration 147 minute 3 patient ( 15 % ) complication ( 1 seroma , 2 superficial cellulitis ) wound dehiscences superficial breakdown . While investigator immediate access entire dataset patient treat Emory open approach , investigator complete data 40 patient recently treat ( last 2 year ) . Of 40 patient , 17 ( 43 % ) complication lymphedema . Of , 5 require hospitalization two complete wound dehiscence require management wound vacuum-assisted closure ( VAC ) . This data complete , reasonably reflect Emory experience allow u conclude data similar report literature historically . While many minimally invasive approach open procedure apply without randomized trial prove efficacy ( splenectomy , hepatectomy , pancreatectomy , partial gastrectomy , name ) , investigator believe prudent adopt new approach cancer operation study prospective fashion . This trial kind investigator one center world minimally invasive knowledge expertise volume urologic melanoma patient potential perform trial . It incumbent upon u complete study . The goal study determine videoscopic approach standard procedure offer well outcome patient respect wound complication prove inferiority videoscopic approach traditional open approach cancer outcome standpoint , specifically time recurrence nodal yield . Patients consider study age 18 80 , either metastatic melanoma merkel cell carcinoma diagnose sentinel lymph node biopsy indication inguinal lymphadenectomy urological malignancy . The study design randomize , prospective trial , analyze wound complication primary endpoint recurrence-free survival secondary endpoint . Our sample size calculation ( see section 8.0 ) indicate sample size 73 patient study arm 37 patient control arm sufficient detect moderate-to-strong effect 80 % power 95 % level statistical significance .</detailed_description>
