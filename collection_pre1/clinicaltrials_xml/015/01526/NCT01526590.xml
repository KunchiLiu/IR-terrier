	<brief_summary>In US , pancreas cancer fifth lead cause cancer relate death . It estimate take 36,800 life 2010 . Unfortunately , cure pancreatic cancer require surgical removal . Surgical removal pancreas associate high morbidity mortality , well high rate complication . One way aid surgeon remove pancreatic tumor provide good idea tumor locate surround structure involve . This currently happen many different modality image ; usually compute tomography ( CT ) endoscopic ultrasound . Even form image ( sometimes others ) , surgeon occasionally open patient find tumor remove due involvement surround structure . One way avoid potentially unnecessary procedure help surgeon navigate delicate procedure would provide detailed information tumor . Several technique currently use image body rapidly advance recent year . Typical advancement come good resolution image contrast enhance desire part image . Ultrasound see two pronged advance . Ultrasound see substantial advance resolution enhance picture quality , contrast use clinically assess pancreatic mass whereas cardiologist use contrast look potential defect heart . The contrast use ultrasound different CT scan . CT scanner use dye potentially hazardous . This dye lead serious kidney damage patient . Ultrasound contrast , hand , make small micro bubble fill harmless gas . Because way ultrasound work , micro bubble reflect sound wave differently surround tissue thus provide contrast normal tissue abnormal tissue . The contrast use study , Definity , contrast used Cardiologists . The CE-EUS use research purpose use clinical decision making . The surgeon blind result research CE-EUS . The investigator compare research pre-operative contrast enhance endoscopic ultrasound image already complete standard-of-care CT scan , actual pancreatic involvement see surgery pathology report .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Endoscopic Ultrasound Vascular Involvement Pancreatic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . CT Scan abdomen - Standard Therapy . The standard care patient question pancreatic lesion undergo CT scanning . After CT scan , appear pancreatic mass may resectable , standard protocol look pancreas patient sedate endoscopic ultrasound diagnostic tissue sample staging . For reason , endoscopist blind CT scan standard care interpret result EUS information . 2 . Consent Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) - Standard Therapy . Before sedated endoscopic ultrasound , patient inform risks procedure , alternative , do . The patient decide undergo endoscopic ultrasound sign consent form . Our goal enroll 30 patient ( This number limited amount contrast receive Lantheus number patient typically see year . Ideally enroll many possible purpose power ) . 3 . Consent Contrast Enhanced Endoscopic Ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) -- Performed exclusively research purpose 1 . After patient inform standard care sign consent form , patient ask wish participate experimental study . If patient interested , questioned potential structural heart defect , congenital heart defect , recent worsen heart lung condition , pulmonary hypertension , potential pregnancy , attempt become pregnant , nursing , allergy contrast . If report relative contraindication , exclude participate study . 2 . If free relative contraindication , provide information study ( see include form ) ask sign consent form well HIPAA authorization . 4 . EUS - Standard Care 1 . At point undergo endoscopic ultrasound pancreas per standard protocol . They peripheral IV start endoscopic technician nurse anesthetist . While patient prepare , research questionnaire ( EUS CE-EUS ) fill ahead time exception finding , order reduce time complete survey . The patient sedate one two way . Either consciously sedate meperidine midazolam surveillance attend gastroenterologist propofol base sedation surveillance anesthesiologist per standard endoscopic ultrasound protocol . 2 . The patient undergo endoscopic ultrasound video image record . 5 . EUS Questionnaire - Preformed exclusively research purpose . Duration le one minute . 1 . The endoscopist fill survey ( see attach ) record impression tumor extent invasion vasculature . This take one minute . EUS criterion vascular invasion loss normal hyperechoic interface tumor vessel , irregular tumor vessel interface , tumor within vessel lumen , vessel encasement , collateral venous occlusion . 6 . Decision FNA - Standard care , important do CU-EUS . If endoscopist feel FNA warrant make decision time . 7 . CE-EUS - Experimental Procedure perform exclusively research purpose a. Dosing Contrast - procedure perform exclusively research purpose . While patient still sedate tissue sampling , experimental aspect procedure begin . At time , receive dose Definity intravenously peripheral IV access agitate . The dose Definity 10 microliters/kg give one two dos , exceed 2cc . A saline flush follow injection contrast timer start . The remain contrast properly dispose sharps container . b . Recording CE-EUS image - procedure perform exclusively research purpose . Duration 3-4 minute . The endoscopist perform additional reading contrast record 3-4 minute segment review later use harmonic mode ultrasound probe mechanical index 0.3 . The mechanical index may need optimize , however previous study find 0.3 optimal . Aspects analyze later sequence filling ( central vs peripheral ) , time ( arterial [ 0-30s ] , venous [ 60-180s ] , post-venous/equilibrium phase [ &gt; 180s ] ) , pattern perfusion ( homogenous v heterogenous , without defect ) degree venous washout . After experimental portion procedure endoscopist fill form ( see attach ) record impression characteristic tumor contrast . The image save comparison CT scan pathology result late time . 8 . FNA - Standard care ( previously decide upon ) . If determine normal EUS CE-EUS patient need tissue sampling , patient undergo sample standard fashion . If patient receive tissue sampling , exam would . When exam finish endoscopist fill remain questionnaire patient recovers . 9 . Patient recovery Endoscopy Suite - Standard Care 10 . Patient transport recovery room - Standard Care 1 . After patient recovers endoscopy room , patient transport recovery room monitor least 30 minute . The patient inform finding EUS per standard care . The patient inform finding CE-EUS significance unknown . 2 . If incidental lesion find EUS patient undergo appropriate follow-up lesion per standard protocol . If incidental find apparent EUS CT , happen show CU-EUS , patient inform find unknown significance . 11 . Radiologist 's Interpretation - Research purpose . After CE-EUS EUS , image randomly order interpreted radiologist . An excel sheet make study place three separate block chronological order Participant 1-10 , 11-20 , 21-30 . In separate column random number generator order first block 1-10 's EUS random order different random order CE-EUS . The radiologist fill attach questionnaire . The Surgeon blind reading research purpose standard care . 12 . Surgery - Standard Care questionnaire procedure research purpose . The surgeon record impression vascular involvement tumor attach questionnaire surgery . 13 . Pathology review - Standard care . If patient pathology send surgery , surgeon label vessel encompass pathologist report whether invasion vasculature . We retrospectively review pathology result surgery comparison .</detailed_description>
