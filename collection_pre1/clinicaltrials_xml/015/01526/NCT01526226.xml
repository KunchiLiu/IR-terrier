	<brief_summary>Preterm child increase risk develop lung disease due immature lung . Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) support increasingly use treatment . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) common NIV-mode . Recently , high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) become alternative NIV-mode . Both nCPAP HFNC provide increase pressure airway aim keep lung open . With nCPAP common use short binasal prong fill nostril completely press tightly nose . With HFNC oxygen/air administer via two small , thin cannula locate inside nostril , nostril block . The aim study compare patient comfort premature infant treat nCPAP HFNC . The investigator hypothesis HFNC increase patient comfort . The study randomize cross study ( 2 x 24 hour ) . Children eligible inclusion bear 34 week gestation moderate respiratory distress , thus `` need '' nCPAP . During study period ( 48 hour ) investigator consider child tolerates treatment nCPAP versus HFNC . Primary outcome patient comfort assess EDIN-score ( Neonatal pain comfort score ) . Secondary outcome stress hormone response ( cortisol saliva ) , surround noise parental satisfaction . The child 's breathing pattern carefully monitor . The study involve extra painful investigation . The investigator plan recruit 20 patient .</brief_summary>
