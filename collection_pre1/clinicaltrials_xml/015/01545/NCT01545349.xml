	<brief_summary>This Phase I , randomize control trial evaluate safety Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) versus placebo elderly subject receive live attenuate influenza vaccine . Lactobacilli part normal flora intestine . LGG one several strain Lactobacilli use probiotic microorganism administer confer `` health benefit '' . Our research focus study possible therapeutic effect LGG . The study hypotheses : 1 . LGG placebo administer twice daily safe well tolerate elderly subject receive live attenuate influenza vaccine , 2 . The immune response influenza vaccine day 21 , 28 , 56 high LGG group placebo group , 3 . The diversity microbiota nasopharyngeal stool specimen day 21 , 28 , 56 great LGG group placebo group .</brief_summary>
