	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group 3-arm study investigate 2 different dos subcutaneous ( SC ) IgPro20 compare placebo maintenance treatment patient CIDP . Patients receive lease 1 dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) within 8 week screen assess 4 separate study period . Patients first undergo Screening Period , follow IgG Dependency Test Period 12 week test ongoing need IgG . Those patient experience CIDP relapse test period administer standardized IVIG regimen IVIG Re-stabilization Period . Patients improve maintain adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause treatment scale ( INCAT ) IVIG Re-stabilization Period continue SC Treatment Period study . Patients enter 24 week SC Treatment Period randomize receive weekly infusion 1 2 IgPro20 dos ( 0.2 0.4 g/kg body weight ) placebo . The overall study duration 52 week . Clinical outcome assess Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause Treatment ( INCAT ) score , maximum grip strength , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) sum score , Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale ( R-ODS ) , electrophysiological evaluation .</brief_summary>
