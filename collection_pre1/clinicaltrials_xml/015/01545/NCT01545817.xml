	<brief_title>Everolimus Post Pazopanib Treatment Metastatic Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-randomised , open label , single-arm phase II study evaluate efficacy safety 1st-line pazopanib follow 2nd-line everolimus patient previously untreated advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Subjects receive initial therapy pazopanib , follow , progression , 2nd-line therapy everolimus . Study treatment , sequential treatment pazopanib follow everolimus , continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent death .</detailed_description>
