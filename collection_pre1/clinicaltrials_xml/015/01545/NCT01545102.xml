	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation ideal comprehensive intervention patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , since address complex interplay medical , psychological behavioural factor face individual . Structured exercise training within cardiac rehabilitation programme firmly recommend patient . However , questionable whether patient achieve adequate dose exercise provide optimal benefit . The essential component set optimal train include appropriate mode , duration , frequency intensity exercise . UK survey cardiac rehabilitation describe frequency duration training , scant information exercise intensity . However , apparent randomise controlled trial exercise training use dose 4 time great UK current practice . The Eastbourne Exercise Cardiology Research Group demonstrate although patient benefit improve quality life submaximal fitness hospital outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme , achieve increase important prognostic indicator report majority exercise training trial . The critical factor term elicit sufficient training effect minimise risk intensity exercise perform . It widely accept traditional method use fix percentage maximal heart rate oxygen uptake set exercise intensity include serious error . The European Society Cardiology recommend cardiopulmonary exercise test use provide objective evaluation metabolic demand exercise . This allow physiologically meaningful reference point establish aerobic exercise prescription solution define safe effective training intensity . The next step determine whether information transfer practical cardiac rehabilitation environment set monitor exercise intensity</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Heart failure chronic , costly life-threatening disorder constitutes significant burden individual National Health Service [ There 27,000 new case report per annum UK . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) recommend ideal comprehensive intervention since address complex interplay medical , psychological behavioural factor face CHF patient carers . Study Aim Primary objective describe exercise intensity , define oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) term individual physiological threshold , CHF patient undergo CR accord current guideline Primary end point : VO2 Secondary objective Secondary objective study : - 1 . To measure rest exercise energy expenditure order ) establish value 1 MET ( rest metabolic rate ) patient CHF , b ) establish MET value ( defined multiple rest metabolic rate ) exercise perform CR session 2 . To measure affective response ( feel bad - feeling good ; level energy - tiredness tension - calmness ) exercise CR session 3 . To measure weekly physical activity level CHF patient undergo Phase III IV CR . For secondary analysis follow secondary end point parameter establish 1 . MET value , define multiple rest oxygen uptake rest metabolic rate ( 1 MET ) , different CR exercise 2 . Ratings affective response Feelings Scale ( FS ) rating perceive activation Felt Arousal Scale ( FAS ) . 3 . Average daily activity 7 day period term step per day period spend sit , stand walk</detailed_description>
