	<brief_title>Dose Reducing Door-to-balloon Time ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction Cause Less Cost ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship quality care cost discuss widely . Higher cost care bring good outcome , vice versa . However , rise spending health care , health care provider , insurance payer , government , consumer begin pursue high quality care low cost .

The Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration ( PHQID ) United State improve process care significant effect cost . Another single hospital experience Indiana , USA , show reduce D2B time STEMI decrease insurance payment well total hospital cost . However , study design before-and-after intervention analysis , actually measure impact D2B time . Besides , payment system study prospective payment , fee-for-service payment Taiwan . In study , try determine whether less D2B time lead cost saving benefit insurance payer well outcomes patient .</detailed_description>
