	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Chronic disease management ( CDM ) present enormous challenge primary care workforce due rise epidemic cardiovascular risk factor . The Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) proven effective improve chronic disease outcome develop country . Evidence model work develop country still scarce . Therefore , aim study evaluate effectiveness EMPOWER-PAR intervention ( multifaceted CDM strategy base CCM ) manage type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) hypertension ( HPT ) , use readily available resource Malaysian public primary care set . METHODS This pragmatic cluster randomise control trial - participatory action research currently conduct 10 public primary care clinic Selangor Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . Five clinic randomly select provide EMPOWER-PAR intervention 1 year , 5 clinic continue usual care . Each clinic recruit consecutive T2DM HPT patient fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion 2-week period . The EMPOWER-PAR intervention consist creating/strengthening multidisciplinary CDM Team ; train team utilise Global CV Risks Self-Management Booklet support patient care reinforce utilise relevant clinical practice guideline aid management prescribing . For T2DM , primary outcome change proportion patient achieve target HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % . For HPT without T2DM , primary outcome change proportion patient achieve target blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg . Secondary outcome include proportion patient achieve target serum lipid profile , body mass index waist circumference . Other outcome measure include medication adherence level , process care prescribe pattern . Patients ' assessment chronic disease care , provider ' perception , attitude perceived barrier deliver care cost-effectiveness intervention also evaluate . CONCLUSION Results study provide objective evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness multifaceted intervention base CCM resource constraint public primary care set . It hop evidence instigate much need primary care system change Malaysia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Empowering Primary Care Providers Patients Improve Chronic Disease Outcomes : The EMPOWER Participatory Action Research ( EMPOWER - PAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES The primary hypothesis T2DM patient proportion achieve target HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % would improve EMPOWER-PAR intervention . The primary hypothesis HPT patient without T2DM proportion achieve target BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg would improve EMPOWER-PAR intervention . The secondary hypothesis T2DM patient proportion achieve target blood pressure ( BP ) &lt; 130/80 mmHg would improve EMPOWER-PAR intervention . The secondary hypothesis group patient ( T2DM HPT without T2DM ) proportion achieve target fast serum lipid , body mass index ( BMI ) waist circumference ( WC ) would improve intervention . Medication adherence level patient ' perception experience receive chronic disease care also expect improve intervention . Secondary hypothesis also make primary care provider ' level term process care prescribe pattern expect improve intervention . Cost-effectiveness analysis primary care provider ' perception , attitude , experience perceive barrier implement intervention also explore . METHODS - Pragmatic cluster-randomised parallel control trial -participatory action research conduct 10 public primary care clinic two state Malaysia Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur ( WPKL ) Selangor ( SEL ) . - The overall duration study 2 year duration intervention 1 year . - Blinding possible due nature complexity intervention . Site Recruitment Site eligibility All 34 clinic lead Family Medicine Specialists ( FMS ) SEL WPKL invite participate study give site feasibility assessment form . To eligible , clinic must satisfy follow criterion : i. minimum 500 T2DM patient 500 HPT patient registry . ii . FMS keen participate study willing lead implementation intervention component clinic . iii . Have minimum capacity implement obligatory component EMPOWER-PAR intervention . iv . locate within 70 km central laboratory blood sample transport back centre analysis . Site selection Site feasibility assessment conduct identify eligible clinic . Out 34 site , 20 fulfil eligibility criterion enter study . These 20 clinic match 10 pair accord geographical location , staff workload . Geographical location divide urban sub-urban area . Urban area define area locate within major city , sub-urban area define area locate surround within commute distance major city . Staffing defined number doctor ally health personnel ( FMS , medical officer , assistant medical officer , staff nurse , dieticians/nutritionists pharmacist ) work clinic . Workload define average number patient see clinic per day . Multistage randomisation perform use computer generate table . The first stage randomly select 5 10 pair include study . The second stage randomly allocate clinic intervention control arm . Patient Recruitment This study recruit consecutive T2DM and/or HPT patient attend select clinic within 2-week recruitment period . They give patient information sheet wait area . Informed consent obtain willing participate . Screening conducted identify eligible participant base inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible patient enrol study . Inclusion criterion Males female age ≥ 18 year diagnose : 1 . T2DM HPT 2 . Seen least last one year primary care clinic condition Exclusion criterion 1 . Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 2 . Receiving renal dialysis 3 . Presenting severe HPT ( Systolic BP &gt; 180mmHg and/or Diastolic BP &gt; 110 mmHg ) 4 . Diagnosed condition result secondary hypertension 5 . Diagnosed circulatory disorder need referral secondary care last 1 year e.g . unstable angina , heart attack , stroke , transient ischaemic attack 6 . Receiving share care primary secondary care complication T2DM and/or HPT 7 . Pregnancy 8 . Enrolled another study All patient intervention arm require see least twice CDM team clinic 1-year intervention period . Those comply consider lose follow-up . There limit number clinic visit patient allow make either arm course study . The EMPOWER-PAR INTERVENTION The study intervention , refer EMPOWER-PAR Intervention , develop accordance Medical Research Council ( MRC ) guidance develop evaluate complex intervention improve health outcome implement primary care clinic period 1-year . The underlying framework develop complex intervention EMPOWER-PAR base 6 interrelated element CCM . The 6 element 1 ) organisation health care ( i.e . provide leadership minimise barrier care ) , 2 ) self-management support ( i.e . facilitate skills-based learning patient empowerment ) , 3 ) decision support ( i.e . provide guidance implement evidence-based care ) , 4 ) delivery system design ( i.e . coordinate care process ) , 5 ) clinical information system ( i.e . track progress report outcome patient provider ) , 6 ) community resource policy ( i.e . sustain care use community-based resource ) . Three obligatory component define EMPOWER-PAR intervention develop base 4 interrelated element CCM ( organisation health care , delivery system design , self-management support decision support ) . These intervention component utilise readily available exist resource Malaysian public primary care set . I. Creating/Strengthening CDM Team-a multidisciplinary team lead FMS improve coordination care T2DM and/or HPT co-existing CV risk factor II . Utilising Global CV Risks Self-Management Booklet support patient self-management III . Utilising Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) T2DM HPT aid management prescribe Two optional component EMPOWER-PAR intervention develop base 2 CCM element ( clinical information system community resource ) : I. Utilising clinical information system conduct clinical audit track progress reporting outcomes patient provider II . Utilising community resource support sustain care SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS The sample size calculation conduct base randomise clustered trial design use PASS software ( Copyright ( c ) 2009 Dr Jerry L. Hintze , All Rights Reserved ) . Sample size calculation T2DM patient A sample size 626 ( 313 arm ) obtain sample 10 cluster ( 5 intervention v 5 control ) 63 subject cluster achieve 91 % power detect 25 % difference proportion subject achieve target HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % baseline intervention control group . The test statistic use two-sided Z test ( unpooled ) . The significance level test 0.05 . Therefore , allow 25 % dropout rate , study aim recruit total sample 836 T2DM patient baseline i.e . 418 arm 84 clinic . Sample size calculation HPT patient without T2DM A sample size 438 ( 219 arm ) obtain sample 10 cluster ( 5 intervention v 5 control ) 44 subject cluster achieve 88 % power detect 25 % difference proportion subject achieve target BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg baseline intervention control group . The test statistic use two-sided Z test ( unpooled ) . The significance level test 0.05 . Therefore , allow 25 % dropout rate , study aim recruit total sample 584 HPT patient baseline i.e . 292 arm 58 clinic . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical analysis plan test primary hypothesis study describe . Continuous variable describe summary statistic ( mean standard deviation ) normally distribute variable . If distribution normal , median inter-quartile range report instead . Other descriptive statistic , minimum maximum value report necessary . Categorical ( nominal/ordinal ) variable describe frequency percentage . All outcomes treated categorical variable ( e.g . proportion patient achieve target HbA1c BP ) . To assess difference proportion patient able reach treatment goal intervention strategy , generalize estimation equation model adjusts cluster effect use . The model independent work model . Treatment effect obtain use estimate marginal mean difference test use Wald chi-square test . The power study recalculate base effect size take account cluster effect study design . An intention-to-treat analysis conduct , P-values le 0.05 consider significant . All analysis carry use SPSS ( IBM Corp . Released 2011 IBM SPSS Statistics Windows , Version 20.0 . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp. ) . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The Ethics Committee UiTM Medical Research Ethics Committee ( MREC ) Ministry Health ( MOH ) approve study protocol . Permission Family Health Development Division ( FHDD ) MOH respective Health District Offices also obtain prior conduct study . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) requirement . Patient information sheet give informed consent obtain participant prior study enrolment . For participant unable read , content consent form read aloud copy patient information sheet give next kin additional explanation give need . Confidentiality personal information ensure time . Subject enrolment do investigator attend doctor reduce subject 's vulnerability participate study . Subjects informed immediate result obtain study may affect care health . DISCUSSION The EMPOWER-PAR first pragmatic , randomise control trial multifaceted chronic disease management strategy conduct Malaysian public primary care set . It expect yield important new evidence improvement T2DM HPT clinical outcome , two prevalent chronic disease manage public primary care sector . Ultimately , result study provide objective evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness multifaceted intervention base CCM resource-constrained public primary care set . If proven effective , result may generalisable Malaysian public primary clinic share characteristic would probably inexpensive replicate . It hop objective evidence EMPOWER-PAR would provide platform instigate much need primary health care system change Malaysia .</detailed_description>
