	<brief_summary>This study investigate benefit use Sputum induction TB diagnosis primary care clinic adult TB suspect either unable produce sputum sample ( sputum scarce ) initial diagnostic work-up 2 negative sputum smear sample ( WHO standard frontline TB diagnosis ) . The investigator hypothesize acquire induce sputum sample smear microscopy liquid TB culture decrease time-to-diagnosis time-to-treatment initiation smear negative/sputum scarce TB patient primary care clinic resource-limited high TB HIV prevalent setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis increase Africa . A key area weakness TB control effort inability make rapid diagnosis . This , part , due inability obtain representative biological sample non-availability cheap , effective , rapid field-friendly diagnostic tool . Indeed , HIV positive patient , sensitivity sputum smear low 20 % , culture result take several week significant proportion patient expectorate sputum . Sputum induction diagnosis TB evaluate several study , show good yield , feasibility safety perform correctly , diagnostic comparability bronchoscopy . Few study evaluate performance induce sputum outside hospital environment tolerability , yield performance outcome sputum induction primary care facility yet evaluate . The objective study two-fold . We seek evaluate , randomize control trial , feasibility , performance outcome impact time-to-diagnosis -treatment sputum induction , high HIV prevalence primary care set , diagnosis smear negative/ sputum scarce TB . We hypothesize acquire induce sputum sample smear microscopy liquid TB culture decrease time-to-diagnosis time-to-treatment initiation smear negative/sputum scarce TB patient primary care clinic resource-limited high TB HIV prevalent set . We also evaluate potential incremental benefit novel technology improve rapidity diagnostic yield use induced sputum sample ( Xpert MTB/RIF assay , microscopic observation drug susceptibility test ( MODS ) Genotype MTB DRplus line probe assay ) .</detailed_description>
