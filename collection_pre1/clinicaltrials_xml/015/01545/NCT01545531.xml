	<detailed_description>Serum creatinine accurately measure kidney function patient mild renal insufficiency certain patient population ( example , individual malnutrition , muscle wasting , cancer , elderly ) [ 8 , 9 ] . The serum creatinine level relate estimating equation , routinely used clinical measure estimate kidney function , dependent muscle mass , influenced age , race , gender , weight . [ 10 , 11 ] . Patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant may large fluctuation nutritional status , muscle mass weight influence glomerular filtration rate base estimation equation serum creatinine level . In fact , recently publish position paper recommend research do specifically evaluate accuracy golemular filtration rate estimate equation cancer patient `` particular focus reduce influence confound factor muscle wasting , malnutrition extracellular fluid volume expansion [ 12 ] . '' Cystatin C cysteine protease inhibitor express nucleated cell freely filter glomerulus . Serum Cystatin C correlate well measure glomerular filtration rate accurately measure kidney function serum creatinine elderly , cancer patient , diabetic renal transplant recipient [ 9 , 13-15 ] . It also linearly associate cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality heart failure risk [ 16 ] . The gold standard measurement Golemular filtration rate use inulin radioisotope-labeled nonlabeled trace quantity EDTA , technetium-99-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid , iothalamate iohexol expensive time intensive limit clinical usefulness . Although study do use cystatin C patient cancer report conflict result compare cystatin C estimate GFR measurement , generally find perform well serum creatinine [ 14 , 17-20 ] . Only one study do HC population evaluate cystatin C measure renal function author include gold standard measurement GFR comparison cystatin C level [ 20 ] . The author find elevation cystatin C patient HCT compare control group . However , elevation correlate serum creatinine creatinine clearance . A plausible conclusion serum cystatin C sensitive marker renal function measure employ . These author also look area curve , receiver operator characteristic curve 1/cystatin C curve show accurate correlate well measure GFR [ 21 ] . Moreover , long-term study do patient population use cystatin C ass renal function define CKD prevalence . Iohexol , non-ionic , low osmolar , X-ray contrast medium ( OmnipaqueR ) safe non-toxic use angiographic urographic procedure , eliminate plasma exclusively glomerular filtration [ 13 ] . Iohexol molecular weight 821 dalton , plasma elimination half-time ~90 min , distribute extracellular space le 2 % plasma protein bind [ 13 , 17 ] . Iohexol excrete completely unmetabolized urine 100 % recovery within 24 hour injection [ 14 ] . Since iohexol quantify small sample , capillary , well venous , sample employ [ 15 ] . Extrarenal elimination iohexol set reduce GFR negligible [ 16 ] . Iohexol measure deproteinized plasma serum HPLC . The commercially available preparation contain two isomer iohexol , handle similarly body [ 15 , 18 ] . An accurate measure kidney function important clinical management medication , choice condition regimen , prognosis , study treatment toxicity . Establishment precise prevalence need design clinical intervention trial .</detailed_description>
