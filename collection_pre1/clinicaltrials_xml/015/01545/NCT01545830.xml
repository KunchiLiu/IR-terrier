	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency widespread appear represent one easily inexpensively modifiable risk factor diabetes cardiovascular disease . More 40 year data link hypovitaminosis D metabolic syndrome , insulin resistance , hyperglycemia , type 2 diabetes increase cardiovascular risk . Screening vitamin D deficiency follow supplementation appropriate individual could among simplest cost-effective measure reduce metabolic syndrome insulin resistance general population . This study test hypothesis increase vitamin D status vitamin D deficient individual metabolic syndrome : 1. reduce multiple serum cardiometabolic risk factor diabetes cardiovascular disease , 2. stabilize reverse stage pre-diabetes , 3. improve quality life , , 4. improve ability make health-related behavioral change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Longitudinal observational study suggest significant inverse association vitamin D status incident prevalent metabolic syndrome/type II diabetes . Results small underpowered trial post-hoc analysis data large trial design bone-specific outcome suggest vitamin D may slow progression diabetes adult glucose intolerance . However , time , randomize trial sufficient size exist ass effectiveness . Importantly , investigator ' study 10,000 Allina employee , investigator find 6 % employee level le 10 ng/mL , 30 % less 20 ng/ml 60 % less 30 ng/ml . Recently , Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study Group review 41,504 patient record least one measure vitamin D level . Surprisingly , Intermountain Allina Employee study demonstrate vitamin D deficiency ( ≤30 ng/ml ) 60 % people test minor difference gender age ( Plotnikoff GA , Finch M , Dusek JA . Impact Vitamin D Deficiency Productivity Health Care Workforce . J Occup Environ Med ( press ) ) . Furthermore , Intermountain group demonstrate vitamin D level less 30 ng/ml , compare level great 30 ng/ml , associate highly significant ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) increase prevalence diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease . Also , without risk factor severe deficiency increase likelihood develop diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . The vitamin D level also highly associate coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , heart failure , stroke ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , well incident death , heart failure , coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , stroke ( p = 0.003 ) , composite ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Numerous prevention effort underway minimize predicted economic human burden increasingly common disease . However , , , prospective clinical trial underway vitamin D intervention . This trial specifically design prospectively test impact vitamin D replenishment metabolic syndrome insulin resistance . The 2011 Endocrine Society guideline assert vitamin D intake current recommendation may associate good health outcome . However , consensus optimal 25 ( OH ) D concentration necessary minimize metabolic syndrome , insulin resistance progression diabetes . This trial design prospectively identify optimal serum level reduction cardiometabolic risk factor .</detailed_description>
