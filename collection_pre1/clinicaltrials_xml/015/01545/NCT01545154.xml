	<brief_summary>This study do find transperineal ultrasound ( TPUS ) help define prostate gland radiation treatment plan improve upon current method image guidance treatment prostate cancer . For patient , TPUS involve placement ultrasound probe perineum , skin scrotum anus , lie back position receive treatment . Image-guidance required treatment prostate cancer prostate shift position depend full bladder rectum . Image-guided radiation therapy do Fletcher Allen Health Care approximately three year . Most commonly , transabdominal ultrasound image obtain every day compare ultrasound do day treatment planning . Adjustments radiation field position do daily basis comparing image . Transperineal ultrasound never use image-guidance . The investigator complete earlier study develop TPUS device process allow u get clear ultrasound picture prostate gland . The TPUS three potential advantage transabdominal method investigator currently use : 1 . Transabdominal ultrasound challenge men . A full bladder help u get clear image , however difficult men prostate cancer comfortably keep full bladder . It also particularly difficult get good image large men long distance skin surface prostate gland . TPUS dependent man full bladder less dependent size man . 2 . TPUS image plan CT image acquire simultaneously . This possible abdominal probe get way CT machine . Simultaneous image eliminates possibility prostate gland shift position time image study . 3 . TPUS place acquire image patient treatment ( abdominal probe get way treatment machine ) may future allow u watch prostate gland treatment . If investigator discover accurately view prostate gland real time , TPUS may ultimately allow u treat even small radiation field possibly decrease risk radiation complication . Patients study treated prostate cancer standard image guidance technique use Fletcher Allen Health Care : transabdominal ultrasound and/or X-ray imaging gold marker seed place prostate gland . In addition standard care , men study TPUS CT scan do total four time 12 week compare method prostate localization course radiation treatment . Some men may choose take part additional study also include MRI pelvis compare TPUS CT. Because prostate gland clearly define MRI , institution ( Fletcher Allen ) routinely patient prostate cancer get MRI scan treatment planning . This proven improve care men prostate cancer possible TPUS provide similarly clear image . The potential advantage TPUS image prostate localization MRI include fact do time CT treatment planning ( eliminate possibility movement prostate gland time MRI time CT ) do much low cost .</brief_summary>
