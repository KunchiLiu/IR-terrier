	<brief_summary>Residual neuromuscular blockade frequently observe early postoperative period patient receive general anesthetic muscle relaxant . At present time uncertain whether certain patient population great risk common anesthetic complication . However , possible elderly surgical patient may exhibit high incidence residual neuromuscular blockade . The aim clinical trial determine incidence residual neuromuscular blockade cohort younger ( age 18-50 ) old ( age 70-90 ) patient undergo surgery general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Age Incidence Postoperative Residual Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>300 patient enrol study . Patients select enrollment review operating room schedule day prior procedure . Two group patient examine ; group 1 consist patient age 18-50 ( n=150 ) group 2 consist patient age 70-90 ( n=150 ) . Patients enrol block 20 ensure equal distribution subject age group time . Anesthetic neuromuscular management standardize study cohort Neuromuscular Monitoring : On arrival PACU , blind research assistant obtain quantitative TOF measurement subject . The TOF-Watch SX use obtain measurement . Two consecutive response TOF stimulation ( separate &gt; 15 second ) obtain , average two value record . If measurement differ great 10 % , additional TOF ratio obtain ( total 4 TOF value ) , close two ratio average . The number patient TOF ratio &lt; 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 ( level residual neuromuscular block associate various adverse clinical outcome ) group compare . Signs Symptoms Residual Neuromuscular Blockade After TOF data collect arrival PACU , patient carefully examine sign symptom muscle weakness blind research assistant . A standardized examination form use determine presence absence muscle weakness variety muscle group . The examination perform arrival PACU 15 minute admission . Respiratory Events Potentially Related Residual Neuromuscular Blockade Pulse oximetry use continuously monitor arterial oxygen saturation ( Sp02 ) patient transport PACU . Patients transport PACU without supplemental oxygen ( unless anesthesia care provider determines oxygen therapy require patient safety-per standard practice ) . All patient place 2 liter nasal cannula oxygen PACU . In PACU , pulse oximetry use continuously measure Sp02 . Oxygenation data store record every minute first 30 minute PACU admission . In addition oxygenation data , patient assess transportation PACU first 30 minute PACU admission evidence airway obstruction . PACU Length Stay The impact age residual blockade length PACU stay determine . The time require meet discharge criterion achieve actual discharge note .</detailed_description>
