	<brief_summary>Netherton Syndrome serious skin disorder cause damage gene call SPINK5 . This gene control formation protein call LEKTI , important skin barrier function . LEKTI inhibit certain enzyme ( serine proteinase ) outermost layer skin ( epidermis ) . The function serine proteinases break intracellular cement hold together horny cell epidermis , order skin able shed cell ( know cell desquamation ) . LEKTI deficiency lead uninhibited desquamation horny cell , result skin become red scaly . The barrier function skin also affect . The permeability skin increase , capacity bind water decrease , cause dryness . The thinness barrier also result absorption chemical , example topical medical treatment . Historically one ten infant die first birthday . Currently proven treatment cure condition . The investigator develop gene therapy approach treat disorder . The investigator use disabled virus ( vector ) carry functional copy SPINK5 gene skin stem cell . Proof-of-principle experiment show investigator restore almost normal shape size upper layer skin skin graft grow lab . Even small number cell genetically modify carry correct SPINK5 gene , seem correction wide area graft . In trial investigator propose graft autologous epidermal sheet generate genetically modify skin stem cell treatment patient Netherton Syndrome . The investigator anticipate production release LEKTI protein even small patch skin beneficial .</brief_summary>
