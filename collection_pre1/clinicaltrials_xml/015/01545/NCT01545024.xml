	<brief_summary>Rocca et al . report first secretion incretins , particular GLP-1 rat regulate enteric nervous system , afferent efferent vagus nerve [ 1 ] . Further , Kazakos et al . [ 2 ] report autonomic nerve disturbance ( AND ) patient T2DM impair incretin effect owe decrease GLP-1 secretion . However , Toft-Nielsen et al . [ 3 ] report decreased GLP-1 response patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) unlikely relate AND , thus , support result Rocca et al . Kazakos et al . Recently , Yabe al . [ 4 ] also observe observation Japanese patient T2DM . Meanwhile , Jin et al . report administration DPP-IV inhibitor recover disturbance diabetic nerve dysfunction rat [ 5 ] . However , unknown whether administration DPP-IV inhibitor effect AND human , although many study perform investigate effect DPP-IV inhibitor glycemic control . Accordingly , significant reinvestigate effect DPP-IV inhibitor glycemic control autonomic neuropathy diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
