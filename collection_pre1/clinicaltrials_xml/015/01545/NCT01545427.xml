This drug use previously treat scleroderma , find advance treatment life span patient type leukemia call chronic myeloid leukemia CML . Gleevec act chemical signal cell may decrease fibrosis ( harden skin occur scleroderma ) . It work interfere process activates many molecule cause fibrosis , include TGFbeta ( may key part disease activity scleroderma ) . This study propose treat patient significant diffuse scleroderma Gleevec 6 month investigate several measure scleroderma disease activity , end treatment ( 0 , 3 month 6 month ) . This randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled trial : 20 patient divide two group 4:1 ratio , 16 patient take 400mg Gleevec per day 4 take placebo . The difference group measure include safety , Modified Rodnan skin score ( mRSS ) , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , global assessment ( 100mm VAS ) change biomarkers blood skin biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof Concept Trial Gleevec ( Imatinib ) Active Diffuse Scleroderma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : Scleroderma connective tissue disease prototypical fibrosis autoantibody vascular abnormality include vasomotor instability ( Raynaud 's ) one end blood vessel obliteration ( 1,2 ) . Scleroderma occur &gt; 2/10,000 ( thousand Canadians affect ) proven therapy modify disease overall ( 3 ) . The purpose study investigate potential Gleevec use novel therapy treatment scleroderma . Background : There two subtypes systemic scleroderma : diffuse limit ( 2 ) . Limited skin involvement include skin involvement distal elbow knee may include neck face , spar trunk proximal extremity . Diffuse scleroderma extensive skin involvement include trunk proximal extremity associate internal organ involvement increase mortality ( 4 ) . For instance , significant interstitial lung disease , cardiomyopathy scleroderma renal crisis common diffuse scleroderma limit . The extent organ involvement area may correlate extent skin involvement worsen skin involvement associate increased mortality worse overall health function measure Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) ( 5 ) . Formulation Objective : Various signal could therapeutically regulate scleroderma PDGF , VEGF , endothelin , TGFβ potential therapeutic target . The inhibition tyrosine kinase decrease cell growth could key signal modifier scleroderma ( 6 ) . Signal transduction modification select target successful treatment cancer , use Gleevec chronic myelocytic leukemia ( 7 ) . Gleevec ( imatinib ) oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor . It use treatment CML GI stromal tumor , reduction mortality CML . Tyrosine kinase activate PDGF TGFbeta , key signal scleroderma proof concept study need determine biological signal proceed disease fibrosis scleroderma . PDGF regulation important fibrotic disease stimulate replication migration myofibroblasts ( 8 ) . Protocol : Subjects active diffuse scleroderma enrol consent receive Gleevec 400mg/od placebo . Serum skin biopsy collect biomarkers . Serum sample take baseline , 3 6 month analyze ELISA/multiplexing change profibrotic cytokine include PDGF , VEGF , endothelin , TGFβ . Skin biopsies take prior first dose 6 month . Modified Rodnan Skin Score ( MRSS ) , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , MD patient global assessment also do time 0 , 3 , 6 month . SF36 Health Transition Score do 0 6 month . Biochemistry safety inflammation do month duration trial . Gleevec 400 mg/od placebo give orally food large glass water 6 month . As proof concept Phase IIa trial randomize active vs. placebo group 4:1 ratio , n=20 . Therefore , 16 patient receive active drug 4 receive placebo . Specific Aims : 1 . Primary outcome measurement : change cytokine expression skin biopsy serum sample profibrotic cytokine . 2 . To determine group difference baseline final skin score Gleevec placebo 6 month use Modified Rodnan Skin Score ( MRSS ) . 3 . To compare AEs ( adverse event ) SAEs ( serious adverse event ) group . 4 . Secondary objective : Comparing secondary outcome measurement : MD global , patient global , HAQ , SF36 , Health Transition , ESR , CRP . Randomization Blinding : The randomization stratify current use methotrexate . It anticipate majority patient trial take methotrexate time randomization , stratification balance group heterogenous response . The randomization do balance block 5 , stratification methotrexate use . The pharmacy call provide medication randomization code . The trial blind patient , research nurse perform study procedure include dispense study drug , physician outcome assessment unaware treatment allocation . Concomitant Medications : Stable dose concomitant methotrexate 25 mg/week tolerate ( po sc ) continue throughout study . In addition , necessary , folate add increased decrease side effect . All standard care allow except medication list . Thus treatment GERD , Raynaud 's , digital ulcer , HTN , delay GI empty , small bowel overgrowth , Sjogren 's symptom , arthritis ( use NSAIDs low dose prednisone ) allow . Severe PAH severe ILD exclude could expectation comorbidity may interfere current 24-week treatment protocol . Steroids increase rare chance patient develop complication co-morbidity require high dos steroid part standard care . Regular need antibiotic small bowel overgrowth allow . Good clinical practice follow appropriate treatment deny . This 'add-on ' treatment standard care . Concomitant medication assume hold stable throughout study . Patients take medication may interact Gleevec ( eg . SSRIs , TCA , trazadone , benzodiazepine , betablockers , etc . ) monitor cautiously . Since Gleevec postulate ( case report ) improve pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) annual echocardiogram do part standard care may compare group determine estimate PAP echocardiogram ( 9 ) . AEs SAEs : The University Western Ontario Ethics Committee approve protocol amendment inform SAEs per usual research conduct . The patient free withdraw consent drop time adverse effect future care . As per trial , AEs SAEs collect . SAEs report expedited way UWO Ethics Committee Novartis . Pregnancies : Pregnancy father child , although serious adverse event , also report serious adverse event form pregnancy form follow determine outcome , include spontaneous voluntary termination , detail birth , presence absence birth defect congenital abnormality . In addition pregnancy father child within 84 day ( 12 week 3 month ) last Gleevec intake report recorded SAE . Any pregnancy occur study participation report use Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form . To ensure patient safety pregnancy must also report Novartis within 24 hour learn occurrence . The pregnancy follow determine outcome , include spontaneous voluntary termination , detail birth , presence absence birth defect congenital abnormality maternal newborn complication . Patients informed risk involve become pregnant take Gleevec Letter Information female partner male study participant require read sign `` Pregnant Partner Data Release Form '' acknowledge informed risk well . Discontinuation Treatment : The patient free drop time . A severe allergic reaction necessitate withdrawal . If sustain cytopenia ( WBC &lt; 2.0 , Hbg &lt; 8.0 Plt &lt; 50,000 ) 2 infusion row patient withdrawn . If WBC &lt; 1.0 Hbg &lt; 7.5 Plt &lt; 10,000 time , patient withdrawn . If sustain elevation AST/ALT twice row , twice upper limit normal , methotrexate decrease 5 mg/week . If elevation persist 2 test , methotrexate hold two week liver enzymes repeat . If still elevate , methotrexate cut half still elevate concomitant med think cause elevation , patient withdrawn . Sample Size : This study pilot anticipate enough power statistically significant group difference skin score . However , effect fibrosis mediator serum tissue specimen may help determine large trial 'go ' 'no go ' . Analysis : This modified intent treat analysis , patient receive least one dose study drug analyze , dropout last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . The primary outcome measurement change profibrotic cytokine expression serum urine sample skin biopsy . Multiplexing used measure 30 analytes interest one 50ul sample biological fluid . Statistics include group ( active placebo ) difference 24 week ( 6 month ) MRSS . There group assessment HAQ , ESR CRP placebo compare Gleevec . The SF36 Health Transition Scores compare use paired test . AEs SAEs quantify compare placebo active treatment . PK PD data analyze thought continue drug development area . If data appear demonstrate benefit , repeat measure ANOVA do determine group differences various time point . Data Safety Monitoring Board : All SAEs report Ethics Committee Novartis . An independent safety board blind treatment allocation meet 3 month monitor study progress SAEs . There interim analysis , study power one . Safety event collect one month discontinue study drug case wherever possible .</detailed_description>
