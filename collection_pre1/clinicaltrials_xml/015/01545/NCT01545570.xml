	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test Holter monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include investigator GSK Medical Monitor ( designee ) agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure objective . Subjects value outside range note excluded enrollment , unless investigator GSK medical monitor ( designee ) agree value question would pose significant safety risk subject compromise study objective . Please see Section 7.1 additional information . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study . Body weight ≥ 50.0 kg BMI within range 19.9 35 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Single Average QTcB &lt; 450 msec . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN screen baseline ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . A positive test HIV antibody . History chronic acute pancreatitis . Note : Subjects lipase value upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening exclude . If amylase result ULN lipase ULN , amylase isoenzyme analysis may perform . If additional test confirm pancreatic amylase isoenzyme fraction cause elevation , subject may enroll study . History thyroid disease : personal family history thyroid cancer unless approve GSK medical monitor ( designee ) , and/or history uncorrected thyroid dysfunction abnormal thyroid function assess TSH , and/or plasma calcitonin screen &gt; 50pg/mL . History family history renal disorder may compromise renal function Creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min . ( estimate serum creatinine ( SCr ) demographic data use CockcroftGault calculation ) : To calculate estimate CockcroftGault GFR ( mL/min ) manually : = ( 140 age ) * ( weight kg ) * ( 0.85 female ) / ( 72 * Cr mg/dL ) History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female .

Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day , prior exposure antidiabetic drug clinical study require approval GSK medical monitor ( designee ) subject consider eligible enrollment . In addition , subject participate clinical trial receive investigational ( nonapproved ) product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor ( designee ) , contraindicate participation . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor ( designee ) medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess approximately 500 mL within 56 day period .</criteria>
