	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Impact Denosumab Disseminated Tumor Cells ( DTC ) Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence disseminate tumor cell ( DTC ) bone marrow woman early stage breast cancer important prognostic factor associate increase recurrence disease-associated death . In pooled analysis 4703 invasive breast cancer patient , detection DTC bone marrow associate increase disease recurrence , distant metastasis , death breast cancer median follow-up period 5.2 year . Subsequent study demonstrate presence DTC bone marrow woman early breast cancer follow completion adjuvant therapy even great impact risk recurrence death breast cancer . Multivariate analysis demonstrate presence marrow cell independent prognostic factor reduce breast cancer specific survival relative risk 6.3 ( 2.3-17.6 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Clearly , detection DTC woman early stage breast cancer marker increase risk relapse death , could serve unique indicator select high risk patient intervention target therapeutic . It long recognize close relationship bone immune system , recent study also suggest addition monocytes/macrophage , T cell ( especially Th17 , subset T helper cell produce IL-17 ) , B cell dendritic cell play important role osteoclast formation . RANKL , addition effect osteoclast , also induce local inflammation . Several recent study demonstrate presence tumor associate macrophage ( TAM ) associate aggressive disease , bad outcome . Preclinical data suggest TAM play important role promote metastasis resistance therapy . In addition RANKL , gene secrete breast cancer cell , include TGF-β , TNF associate factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) , Hypoxia Induced Factor -1 ( HIF-1 ) Bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( BMP2 ) , also involve bone-cancer `` vicious cycle '' induce RANKL expression . Cytokines , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-17 , TNF-α CSF-1 , also play important role osteolysis immune response bone microenvironment regulate TAM function ( CSF-1 , IL-4 IL-17 ) RANKL expression . Recently , CD47 Signal Regulatory Protein α ( SIRPA ) also show impair macrophage function , associate increase risk recurrence patient breast cancer . The investigator hypothesize patient high DTC may higher expression RANKL chronic inflammatory cytokine . The investigator plan evaluate expression RANK , RANKL , TRAF6 , BMP2 , CSF-1 , CD47 , IL-17 SIRPA isolate DTC bone marrow hematopoietic cell , correlate result outcome patient enrol trial . The investigator hypothesize treatment denosumab decrease number DTC woman early stage breast cancer complete adjuvant neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy possibly prevent cancer cell migration , promote cancer cell death change bone `` hostile '' environment . The investigator propose conduct non-randomized phase II trial test hypothesis woman early stage breast cancer persistent DTC follow adjuvant systemic therapy . Patients DTC receive denosumab monthly 6 month , every 3 month total one-year treatment , mirror schedule utilize ongoing randomized phase III denosumab versus placebo D-CARE trial . DTC monitor follow 6 month 12 month therapy . The investigator anticipate treatment reverse `` vicious cycle '' bone cancer cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ≥18 year age histologically cytologically confirm stage I , II , III breast cancer . 2 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 3 . Prior therapy : 1 . Prior adjuvant therapy require participation study . 2 . If adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment chemotherapy recommend , must complete study start , 18 month prior study start . 3 . If adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) recommend , patient receive least 3 month therapy eligibility bone marrow perform . 4 . Patients surgery follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy hormonal therapy eligible 5 . Patients must complete definitive surgery completely resect disease . 6 . Concomitant hormonal therapy allow . 7 . Concomitant adjuvant trastuzumab permit 8 . If adjuvant hormonal treatment recommend , patient receive least 3 month therapy screen bone marrow perform . 4 . Bone marrow aspirate positive IE/FC assay within 12 week study entry 1 . Definition positive : &gt; 10 DTC/ml 2 . Timing bone marrow aspiration determine study eligibility i.If patient receive either adjuvant therapy hormonal therapy alone , aspiration may perform diagnosis part large micrometastasis study UCSF , follow diagnosis patient receive initial surgery elsewhere . This also true patient surgery follow neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer . ii.If patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy , aspiration perform least three week chemotherapy complete . iii.For trastuzumab hormone therapy , see . 5 . Laboratory study 1 . Liver function test within normal limit , include total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , AST ( elevation total bilirubin due Gilbert 's disease allow ) . Gilbert 's disease : common hereditary cause increase indirect bilirubin , normal direct bilirubin . 2 . Calculated creatinine clearance ( calculated GFR ) &gt; 30 ml/min 6 . Ability understand sign inform consent 7 . Patients surgery follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy hormonal therapy eligible participate trial . 1 . Karnofsky performance status &lt; 90 % 2 . Patients participate study allow receive bisphosphonate therapy study period , either oral intravenous . 3 . Patients complete adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy 18 month prior study screen . 4 . A history malignancy within last 5 year except basal cell carcinoma skin . 5 . A history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 6 . Severe , concurrent illness would likely prevent patient able comply study protocol . 7 . Pregnant lactate woman woman childbearing potential use effective method birth control . 8 . Significant dental disease require major intervention study period , tooth extraction 9 . Significant coagulopathy would prevent safe bone marrow aspiration</criteria>
