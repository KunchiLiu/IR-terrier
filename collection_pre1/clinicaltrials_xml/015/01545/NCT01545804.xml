	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label phase II trial . Eligible patient must histological clinical diagnosis HCC , advance tumor amenable loco-regional therapy , document progression intolerance sorafenib-based treatment anti-angiogenic therapy first-line therapy advance HCC , ECOG performance status 0 1 , Child-Pugh class A liver function , measurable tumor ( RECIST 1.1 ) . All enrol patient receive lenalidomide , start 25 mg orally daily day 1-21 , every 4 week . Lenalidomide treatment continue objective disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , voluntary discontinuation . Dose titration do accord severity adverse event . Tumor assessment do 4 week 8 week treatment every 8 week thereafter objective disease progression . All patient receive DCE-MRI baseline , day 3 ± 1 day , day 14 ± 2 day . The primary endpoint percentage patient tumor progression-free ( accord RECIST 1.1 ) 6 month lenalidomide treatment . It estimate 2nd-line setting , 20 % less patient remain progression-free 6 month current treatment , i.e. , standard treatment . Lenalidomide consider effective percentage patient remain progression-free 6 month increase 40 % . With type I type II error 0.05 0.1 , respectively , 50 evaluable patient , i.e. , patient receive least 4 week study medication receive first schedule assessment tumor response , require planned sample size 55 patient , assume 10 % dropout rate . The study expect complete 2 year .</detailed_description>
