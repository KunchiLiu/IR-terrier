	<detailed_description>Background : Multiple observational study report blood product component ratio ( i.e. , plasma : platelet : RBCs ) approach 1:1:1 ratio , find fresh whole blood , associate significant decrease truncal hemorrhagic death overall 24-hour 30-day mortality among injured patient . The rationale 1:1:1 ratio close transfusion regimen approximate whole blood , fast hemostasis achieve minimum risk coagulopathy . The current DoD guideline specifies use 1:1:1 , practice follow almost combat casualty . In observational study , lead center report good outcome across range different blood product ratio . For example , 1:2 plasma : RBC ratio use little guidance regard platelet . The propose randomized trial intend resolve debate uncertainty regard optimum blood product ratio . Study Design : Randomized , two-group , controlled Phase III trial Vanguard stage . Equal random allocation treatment use stratify , permute block randomly choose block size stratification site . Objective : To conduct Phase III multi-site , randomize trial subject predict massive transfusion , compare efficacy safety 1:1:1 transfusion ratio plasma platelet red blood cell ( close approximation reconstitute whole blood ) 1:1:2 ratio . The co-primary outcome 24-hour 30-day mortality . The PROPPR Trial conduct exception inform consent ( EFIC ) . Additionally , laboratory data trial add understand trauma induce coagulopathy ( TIC ) inflammation .</detailed_description>
