	<brief_summary>Iron overload severe complication multiple blood transfusion . As body physiologic mechanism clear iron , repeat transfusion cause iron accumulation organ lead iron toxicity . Accurate assessment iron overload paramount quantify excessive iron accumulation monitor response iron chelation therapy . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method use noninvasively measure hepatic iron concentration ( HIC ) . Although MRI-based measurement transverse relaxation rate ( R2 R2* ) accurately predict biopsy-proven HICs 15 mg Fe/g , previous study show precision limit HICs 15 mg Fe/g inaccurate 25 mg Fe/g . Current R2* gradient-echo ( GRE ) MR technique fail occasionally high iron overload ( HIC ~ 15-25 mg Fe/g ) always massive iron overload ( HIC &gt; 25 mg Fe/g ) R2* high MR signal decay measure accurately . Overall accrual : 235 ( 200 patient , 35 healthy volunteer ) Purpose : To determine new MRI ( UTE ) measure amount iron liver people large amount iron compare result patient 's liver bx . Estimated patient accrual 200 . It estimate 41 patient clinical indication liver biopsy . Volunteer purpose : To test UTE MRI ensure run correctly test patient , collect data normal value iron liver people without iron overload use UTE MRI compare current MRI ( GRE ) UTE . The UTE MRI give accurate value liver iron patient large iron deposit liver , therefore provide accurate mean diagnose , monitor , provide treatment participant . This new technology impact care many different population iron overload , patient sickle cell disease thalassemia . Estimated accrual healthy volunteer 35 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MIDAS study prospective non-therapeutic study test new MRI technique assessment iron overload liver : newly develop ultra short echo time ( UTE ) , R2*-UTE . The R2*-UTE technique , develop St. Jude investigator Department Radiological Sciences , first test healthy volunteer feasibility implementation technique . The technique test research participant , R2*-GRE R2*-UTE technique perform , addition liver biopsy liver iron quantitation clinically indicate . Quantitation liver tissue iron do Mayo Clinic Laboratory Rochester , Minnesota . Healthy volunteer liver biopsy perform two type R2*-MRI technique perform compare . Primary Objective : - To test association hepatic iron content ( HIC ) measure newly develop 1.5T R2*-UTE technique HIC quantify liver biopsy subject iron overload . Secondary Objectives : - To explore relationship 1.5T R2*-UTE 1.5T R2*-GRE measurement healthy volunteer subject iron overload . - To explore relationship 1.5T R2*-UTE measurement iron study ( serum iron transferrin saturation ) subject iron overload .</detailed_description>
