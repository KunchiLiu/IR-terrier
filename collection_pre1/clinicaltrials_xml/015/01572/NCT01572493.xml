	<brief_summary>Background : - People cancer weak immune system result cancer , prior treatment . . Still , treatment stimulate immune system show effective number different cancer . Recombinant human interleukin-15 ( rhIL-15 ) drug design boost immune system . Researchers interested see rhIL-15 strengthen immune system 's response cancer . The drug give vein without break 10 day ( 240 hour ) . Objectives : - To see rhIL-15 give continuous infusion 10 day use treat advance cancer - Identify side effect associate treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance cancer effective treatment . Design : - Participants screen procedure include physical exam medical history , laboratory ( blood ) test x-rays ( Imaging study ) determine suitability protocol . -- Appropriate participant easily accessible tumor deposit may also ask one pretreatment one post ( cycle 1 ) treatment tumor biopsy . . - Eligible participant admit hospital rhIL-15 treatment spend 12 day hospital . . - Participants receive one 10 day infusion cycle ( every 42 day ) long serious side effect disease progress . - Participants continue treatment long image study show tumor continue shrink two additional cycle disappear x-ray make cancer completely go . - Participants stop treatment side effect tumor shrink stop respond treatment continue follow-up visit monitor outcome rhIL-15 treatment evidence cancer progress begin another treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) stimulatory cytokine number desirable immunotherapeutic feature , clinical trial evaluate recombinant human ( rh ) IL-15 underway . - In contrast IL-2 , IL-15 treatment stimulate activation-induced cell death Tcells ; potentially inhibit immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell , contributes proliferation , differentiation activation CD8+ T-cells NK-cells maintenance long-term CD8+ memory T-cells . - IL-15 active number syngeneic mouse preclinical tumor model , vacciniabased construct express IL-15 induced long-lasting , high-avidity cytotoxic CD8+ Tlymphocyte response appear effective similar IL-2 expressing vaccine . - Pharmacology/toxicology ( pharm/tox ) experiment non-human primate ( NHP ) rhesus macaque preliminary result first-in-human phase I trial examine rhIL-15 give IV bolus ( IVB ) 12 consecutive day indicate significant stimulation expansion NK-cells CD8+ T-cells . - rhIL-15 give IVB 1 mcg/kg dose level appear well tolerate despite presence common cytokine-related side effect indicate 0.1 mcg/kg/day appropriate initial dose level phase I safety trial continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV ) rhIL-15 . - Comparison pharmacokinetic immunologic assessment IVB phase I trial data set NHP pharm/tox experiment suggest CIV rhIL-15 may great potential stimulating anticancer cellular immune response manageable safety profile . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : - Determine safety , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) rhIL-15 administer CIV 10 consecutive day ( 240 hour ) subject metastatic unresectable cancer curative palliative measure either exist associate survival advantage . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : - Patients great equal to18 years-old , ECOG PS less equal 1 , pathologically confirm metastatic unresectable cancer curative palliative measure either exist associate survival advantage . - Patients measurable evaluable disease , normal organ bone marrow function . DESIGN : - This single-institution , open-label , non-randomized 3 + 3 design phase I dose escalation study . - Groups 3 6 subject receive CIV rhIL-15 dose 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 mcg/kg/day 10 day provide DLT observe . - After assessment 10-day dosing cohort complete , new group 3 6 subject receive CIVrhIL-15 dose 3 , 4 5 mcg/kg/day 5 day provide DLT observe . - Patients evidence response absence significant toxicity eligible repeat cycle treatment . - Samples correlative study obtain prior treatment specific time point treatment assess pharmacokinetics rhIL-15 , effect rhIL-15 immune cell subset population pro-inflammatory cytokine level peripheral blood development neutralize anti-rhIL-15 antibody .</detailed_description>
