	<brief_summary>Background : - Multiple myeloma blood cancer affect plasma cell . These cell help produce antibody fight infection . Smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM ) relate condition may develop multiple myeloma . The current standard care SMM close follow-up without treatment multiple myeloma develops . However , researcher study possible treatment SMM . One possible treatment involve combination cancer treatment drug . - Lenalidomide drug may help reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Dexamethasone steroid often give anti-cancer drug . These two drug approve treatment multiple myeloma respond least one treatment . Carfilzomib experimental drug effective treat multiple myeloma . Researchers want combine three drug see safe effective treatment SMM . Objectives : - To see carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone safe effective treatment smolder multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age SMM likely progress multiple myeloma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test , baseline bone marrow scan . Bone marrow sample also collect . - Participants eight 28-day cycle treatment three study drug . The drug give tablet infusion . Treatment monitor frequent blood test study visit . - After first four cycle , participant eligible stem cell transplant stem cell collect stored future use . - At end eight cycle , participant whose disease progress 12 cycle treatment lenalidomide tablet alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - SMM precursor condition MM define clinical parameter M-protein great equal 3.0 g/dL bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 % absence end organ disease . - Risk progression high risk SMM 5 year 72-75 % median time progression &lt; 2 years.1-2 - The current standard care SMM close follow-up without treatment symptomatic MM develops . However , IMWG state Preventive clinical trial need consider patient high risk smolder myeloma . - Carfilzomib new proteasome inhibitor potent anti-MM effect OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective study assess response rate CRd patient high-risk SMM . ELIGIBILITY : - SMM accord International Myeloma Working Group definition 3 i.e . : - Serum M-protein great equal to3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cell great equal to10 % , - Absence anemia : Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl - Absence renal failure : serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL . Absence hypercalcemia : Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl 2.65 mmol/L - Absence lytic bone lesion - Measurable disease within past 4 week define one following : - Serum monoclonal protein great equal 1.0 g/dl - Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour - Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt; 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio ( reference 0.26-1.65 ) - High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic2 Spanish PETHEMA criterion - Age &gt; 18 year - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 - Male female patient accepts able use recognise effective contraception ( oral contraceptive , IUCD , barrier method contraception conjunction spermicidal jelly ) throughout study relevant - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal to1.0 K/uL , hemoglobin great equal to8 g/dL , platelet count great equal 75 K/microL - Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , AST ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN - Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min determine Cockcroft-Gault formula : CrCl = ( 140 Age ) x Mass ( kilogram ) x [ 0.85 Female ] 72 x Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) . If calculate CrCl base Cockcroft-Gault method &lt; 60 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also great equal 60 ml/min . DESIGN : - Single arm pilot trial combination therapy ( carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ) high risk smolder multiple myeloma - Patients receive 8 cycle induction combination therapy CRd - Each cycle consist 28-days - After 4 cycle therapy , transplant eligible patient undergo stem cell collection - After 8 cycle CRd , patient receive lenalidomide extend dosing ( phase I ) 12 cycle . After 12 cycle , patient option continue extend dosing ( phase II ) one additional year . - Patients routine blood work SPEP free light chain monthly - Pre- post-treatment bone marrow biopsy obtain confirmation diagnosis correlative study - Patients also undergo evaluation minimal residual disease regular interval time point , use multi-parametric flow cytometry FDG PET-CT - This single arm pilot study plan initially enrol 12 evaluable patient detect VGPR baseline . A replicate cohort 16 evaluable patient enrol order precisely define response rate CRd regimen population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Smoldering Multiple Myeloma confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI base International Myeloma Working Group Criteria : Serum Mprotein great equal 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 % Absence anemia : Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl Absence renal failure : serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Absence hypercalcemia : Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl Absence lytic bone lesion Measurable disease within past 4 week define one following : Serum monoclonal protein great equal 1.0 g/dl Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt; 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use carfilzomib combination lenalidomide patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal to1.0 K/uL platelet great equal to75 K/uL hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3.0 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine Clearance great equal 60 ml/min . CrCl calculate Cockcroft Gault method . CrCl ( calculate ) = ( 140 Age ) time Mass ( kilogram ) time [ 0.85 Female ] 72 time Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) . If calculate CrCl base CockcroftGault method &lt; 60 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also great equal 60 ml/min . Highrisk SMM per Mayo Clinic Spanish PETHEMA criterion All study participant must register mandatory RevAssist program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist .

Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior prescribe lenalidomide Cycle 1 ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . All patient must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Concurrent systemic treatment prior therapy within 4 week SMM Treatment corticosteroid indication permit Patients prior proteasome inhibitor therapy exclude Patients diagnosis MM Contraindication concomitant medication , include antiviral , anticoagulation prophylaxis , tumor lysis prophylaxis , hydration give prior therapy History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition carfilzomib lenalidomide agent use study , bortezomib thalidomide . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes Pregnant lactating female . Pregnant woman exclude study Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide .
