	<detailed_description>Background In patient one anatomical functional ventricular chamber , encompass spectrum rare complex congenital cardiac malformation , stag surgical approach view ultimate Fontan operation become procedure choice . Especially early era , perioperative mortality lead cause death . However , many patient long high-quality life , continuously improve well understanding Fontan hemodynamics refinement surgical procedure . Nevertheless , prospect eventual failure Fontan circulation remain major concern . More specifically , evaluation pulmonary circulation become particularly important fail Fontan circulation become common indication cardiac transplantation . Although essential , especially preoperative setting , comprehensive evaluation pulmonary circulation remain difficult patient population . Different type Fontan circulation Atriopulmonary connection In atriopulmonary connection , right atrium interpose valveless contractile chamber systemic venous pulmonary arterial bed . Although initially believe beneficial , interposition valveless pulsatile chamber contribute positively fluid energy . Moreover , pulsation result price high upstream pressure , whereas downstream pressure remain unchanged . Total cavopulmonary shunt This procedure consist divert superior vena cava return pulmonary artery connect vena cava inferior pulmonary artery . This action achieve either construction composite conduit make sinus venarum prosthetic patch ( intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection lateral tunnel ) extracardiac conduit ( extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection ) . Our global hypothesis absence pulsatile pulmonary flow may lead development pulmonary vascular lesion Fontan operation - together absence subpulmonary ventricle pressure generation - increase afterload result systemic ventricular underfilling eventually lead fail Fontan circulation . Fontan attrition The systemic ventricle Although preload reduction may lead inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy , concomitant ventricular relaxation problem decrease capacity adaptation increase afterload , generally accept pulmonary vasculature important mild ventricular dysfunction patient population . Naturally , severe ventricular dysfunction affect patient 's prognosis . The pulmonary circulation The absence right ventricular pulmonary arterial couple profound influence systemic venous return pulmonary circulation . Several aspect take account evaluate pulmonary circulation 1 . Systemic venous pressure . Systemic venous pressure , approximately 5 mmHg healthy control rest remain unchanged exercise , high Fontan patient . In Fontan patient , absence right ventricle pressure generation , degree congestion require order force transpulmonary flow . However , rest pressure 20 mmHg rarely see pressure would lead complication ( oedema , pleural effusion ascites ) . Interestingly , pressure change observe exercise normal Fontan patient quite similar . In healthy control , increase mean pulmonary artery pressure 15 mmHg rest 30 mmHg exercise . In Fontan patient , mean right atrial pressure increase 15 mmHg rest 25 mmHg exercise . 2 . Left atrial pressure . In healthy control , leave atrial pressure show little variability rest mainly determine atrioventricular valve ventricular dysfunction . In Fontan patient , diastolic parameter difficult assess preload insufficiency considered.8 During exercise , leave atrial pressure normally remain stable increase somewhat healthy individual . However , data available leave atrial pressure exercise Fontan patient . 3 . Pulmonary circulation Although still unequivocal proof , several author indicate PVR appear major determinant cardiac output Fontan patient rest exercise . A low PVR even important patient possibility adapt high afterload , whereas patient subpulmonary ventricle , increase afterload counter RV hypertrophy . It suggest Fontan patient low PVR remain stable many decade , whereas high PVR appear poor prognostic factor . Measurement PVR problem Fontan patient Most commonly , PVR measure use Fick method base principle known amount specific indicator add volume fluid . If concentration addition know , volume fluid calculate . The Fick method use physiological uptake oxygen indicator . However , method may inaccurate patient population . Other technique , dye dilution technique thermodilution technique suffer limitation , reduce reliability presence shunt valvular regurgitation . In order provide accurate measurement PVR , combine approach invasive pressure measurement velocity-encoded magnetic resonance become available , proven feasible different patient population . Cardiac output measure use approach show accurate feasible Fontan patient . Moreover , flow leave right pulmonary artery measure separately . Measurement PVR ventricular volume exercise As mention earlier , transpulmonary flow Fontan patient dependent presence low PVR normal behavior PVR exercise order able increase cardiac output . An increase PVR exercise would cause pronounced underfilling systemic ventricle subsequently less increase even decrease stroke volume . Both pressure flow measurement show feasible patient congenital heart disease rest exercise . Measurement PVR ventricular volume vasodilatation Several study show drug affect pulmonary vasculature ( sildenafil , bosentan , NO ) reduce PVR increase cardiac output select patient . Especially patient elevate PVR , drug potential decrease PVR increase ventricular volume , cardiac output exercise tolerance . Whether drug improve outcome remain evaluate . Aims study Feasibility measure PVR Fontan patient use simultaneous acquisition invasive pressure MR flow data . Effect Sildenafil 50 mg PVR , ventricular volume function rest Effect bicycle stress PVR , ventricular volume function Evaluating reliability bicycle stress echocardiography determine ventricular volume function indirect parameter reflect status pulmonary vasculature</detailed_description>
