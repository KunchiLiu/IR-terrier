	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine impact community-based screening treatment abnormal vaginal flora urinary tract infection early pregnancy ( 13-19 week ) preterm live birth Sylhet district , Bangladesh . Hypothesis 1 : Community-based screening treatment abnormal vaginal flora ( Nugent score &gt; 4 ) urinary tract infection early pregnancy ( 13-19 week ) reduce population rate preterm live birth least 15 % . The secondary aim study : - To determine impact community-based screening treatment abnormal vaginal flora urinary tract infection : - proportion pregnancy outcomes occur prior 37 week ( late miscarriage , preterm still birth preterm live birth ) ; - proportion baby early onset neonatal sepsis . - To determine prevalence abnormal vaginal flora urinary tract infection , include asymptomatic bactiuria , among pregnant woman Sylhet district , Bangladesh . - To evaluate accuracy simple , low-cost , point care diagnostic test detect bacterial vaginosis urinary tract infection community health worker rural , develop country setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Burden Maternal Genitourinary Tract Infections : Genital urinary tract ( GU ) infection may due endogenous sexually transmit pathogen , estimate affect 41 % woman reproductive age globally , although wide regional , country , population specific variation ( Table 1 ) . These estimate , however , may underestimate burden develop country , 60-80 % GU infection asymptomatic pregnant woman [ 1 ] , furthermore many woman never receive appropriate medical care resource poor setting . Several epidemiologic study conduct Bangladesh report prevalence GU infection different population [ 2-15 ] . Genital tract infection , particularly sexually transmitted infection common among urban high risk population , i.e . commercial sex worker . In rural Bangladesh , burden disease associate bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) ( 5.9-18.9 % ) [ 3 , 4 ] asymptomatic bactiuria ( 12 % ) high [ 12 ] . In urban area , mostly Dhaka , prevalence BV high ; one study report prevalence 28 % [ 8 ] . There know data prevalence intermediate vaginal flora Bangladesh . The prevalence sexually transmit infection include Gonorrhea , Chlamydia , Trichomonas Syphilis high among high risk urban population Bangladesh generally low rural area . Given prevalence data , postulate among pregnant woman rural Sylhet district Bangladesh , BV UTI prevalent GU infection . Rationale screen treat asymptomatic woman The rationale treat asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis ( Nugent score 7-10 ) asymptomatic intermediate flora ( Nugent score 4-6 ) base data : 1 ) show association adverse pregnancy outcome [ 38 ] , 2 ) several promising trial show treatment may reduce preterm birth [ 39 , 40 ] . Up 84 % bacterial vaginosis case asymptomatic [ 23 ] . In meta-analysis 32 study develop develop country Leitich et al , asymptomatic BV ( Nugent score 7-10 ) associate 6.32 time elevated risk late miscarriage ( 95 % CI 3.65-10.94 ) 2.16 time ( 95 % CI 1.56-3.00 ) increase risk preterm birth . The association preterm birth high BV detect early pregnancy ( &lt; 16 week , OR 2.97 , 95 % CI 1.48-5.98 ) [ 38 ] . Among woman prior history preterm birth , Hauth colleague find screen treatment asymptomatic BV ( Nugent score 7-10 ) metronidazole erythromycin 22 week gestation significantly reduce incidence preterm birth 46 % placebo group 31 % treatment group [ 41 ] . In multi-center NICHD BV trial , 1953 woman asymptomatic BV 16-24 week gestation randomize receive two dos metronidazole ( 2g ) placebo ; however , treatment significantly affect preterm delivery adverse perinatal outcome [ 42 ] . Intermediate vaginal flora ( Nugent score 4-6 ) heterogeneous condition also associate elevate risk preterm birth neonatal infection [ 43-46 ] . Intermediate vaginal flora comprise 15 % abnormal vaginal flora ( Nugent score &gt; =4 ) [ 39 ] . In recent trial , Ugwumadu et al report early ( 12-22 week gestation ) screen treatment abnormal vaginal flora ( Nugent score &gt; 4 ) 5 day oral clindamycin result significant reduction spontaneous preterm birth rate ( 12 % placebo vs. 5 % treatment group ) late miscarriage ( 13-24 week ; 4 % placebo vs. 1 % treatment group ) [ 39 ] . Similarly , Lamont et al report early ( 13-20 week ) treatment abnormal vaginal flora ( Nugent score &gt; 4 ) intravaginal clindamycin reduce incidence preterm birth 60 % [ 40 ] . Potential explanation treatment effect 2 late trial may include : 1 ) early time treatment , prior amniotic membrane seal uterus 20 week [ 47 ] , may thus prevent early ascension bacteria intrauterine cavity ; 2 ) antibiotic choice : 5-7 day course clindamycin , great activity Mobiluncus atypical Mycoplasma specie vs. 2 day metronidazole [ 26 ] ; 3 ) treatment abnormal vaginal flora Ugwumadu et al Lamont et al , vs. treatment BV NICHD trial . A Cochrane meta-analysis conclude risk preterm birth significantly reduce treatment abnormal vaginal flora ( Nugent score &gt; 4 ) ( 2 trial , 894 woman ; OR 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.32-0.81 ) . Thus , low-resource setting rural Bangladesh , BV preterm birth prevalent , treatment abnormal vaginal flora early pregnancy may hold promise reduce incidence preterm birth , evaluation well-conducted community-based randomize trial need .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All woman become pregnant study area eligible participate trial . We identify woman miss period monthly surveillance health worker identify pregnant woman positive pregnancy test conduct CHWs . Thus enrollment may begin soon 5 week gestation continue 19 week gestation . A sample woman enrol early gestation ( &lt; 12 week ) , consider enrolment gestational age substudy . The first CHW visit screen abnormal vaginal flora urinary tract infection occur initial enrollment 1319 week . Their infant enrol well . Subjects exclude study recall uncertain report LMP ( due lactational amenorrhea , recent discontinuation contraceptive irregular menses ) , history irregular bleeding due injectable depoprovera , history severe chronic disease base selfreported history medical history checklist . For woman report missed period pregnancy surveillance , CHW perform urine pregnancy test confirm pregnancy keep log positive pregnancy test LMP . Pregnant woman uncertain refuse participate initial visit allow time consider enroll next study visit still meet inclusion criterion . Women give information regard study CHWs answer question family . If woman certain whether would like participate , allow 1 week consider participation , CHW return 1 week revisit participation answer additional question . If woman refuse participate visit , long approached participate . Families withdraw study time , study staff available answer question family may time .</criteria>
