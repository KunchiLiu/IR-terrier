The propose study randomize control trial enrol 242 largely rural Veterans uncontrolled diabetes clinically-significant depressive symptom . Both group receive screening , education , notification clinical finding along follow-up usual primary care . HOPE participant also receive behavioral coach telephone session six month period . Patients control group screen , provider notify high risk patient ' status need intervention . Both group receive usual primary care subsequent 6 month maintenance period . Study measurement use self-report questionnaire also collect baseline , 6 12 month follow-up . The investigator also conduct chart review evaluate usual care blood test diabetes control . Changes measurement baseline compare group . This intervention reach Veterans rural set community-based primary care need , especially care blends treatment strategy physical emotional health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Background : The co-occurrence diabetes depressive symptom highly prevalent dramatic consequence quality life health affect patient . Due complex interrelation condition , patient often experience psychological physiological difficulty . Furthermore , Veterans diabetes depressive symptom rural setting limit access care . Interventions reach Veterans rural / community-based primary care need , especially blend treatment strategy physical emotional health . Project Objectives : Specific ( Primary ) Aim ( 1 ) : Compare effectiveness Healthy Outcomes Patient Empowerment ( HOPE ) intervention enhance usual care ( EUC ) 6 12 month follow-up . Hypothesis 1a : After 6 month ( active treatment phase ) , HOPE produce great improvement diabetes control ( measure hemoglobin A1c level ) depression ( measure PHQ-9 score ) EUC . Hypothesis 1b : At 12 month ( 6-month active phase plus 6-month maintenance phase ) , HOPE participant continue evidence significant great improvement HbA1c PHQ-9 compare EUC participant . Exploratory Specific Aim ( 2 ) : To examine role moderator mediator intervention effectiveness Exploratory Aim 2a . To evaluate factor mediate moderate effectiveness 6 12 month enrol patient ( regardless intervention group assignment ) . Potential mediating moderate variable include patient-level ( clinical factors-diabetes distress self-efficacy sociodemographics ) facility-level factor ( availability medical mental health service clinical site ) . Exploratory Aim 2b . To evaluate factor mediate moderate effectiveness 6 12 month patient enrol HOPE intervention arm . Intervention factor include adherence ( e.g . session attendance ) , fidelity ( rating coach effectiveness ) , treatment implementation ( e.g. , goal set quality self-management behavior ) well significant predictor obtain Aim 1a . Exploratory Specific Aim ( 3 ) : Evaluate potential embed HOPE intervention process within VA CBOC use RE-AIM framework evaluate effectiveness behavioral intervention . Exploratory Aim 3a - Reach . Compare clinical demographic characteristic enrol study participant characteristic potentially eligible patient CBOC . Exploratory Aim 3b - Adoption . Qualitatively elicit clinician ' perception behavioral coach , patient ' use action plan , responses coach ' recommendation preparation future implementation Project Methods : The propose study randomize control trial enrol 242 largely rural Veterans uncontrolled diabetes clinically-significant depressive symptom . Both group receive screening , education , notification clinical finding along follow-up usual primary care . HOPE participant also receive 6 behavioral coach telephone session 3 booster session six month period . Coaches use standardize , theory-based process conduct session aim create patient-centered articulated goal behavioral action plan . Participants ' primary care provider notify session discussion resultant goal action plan . Both group receive usual primary care subsequent 6 month maintenance period . Hemoglobin A1c PHQ-9 measurement along self-report questionnaire also collect baseline , 6 12 month follow-up . Changes measurement baseline compare group . Analytic evaluation intervention mediators/moderators implementation also conduct 6 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Veterans comorbid diabetes depressive symptom receive primary care service VA CBOCs throughout Southeast Texas well MEDVAMC patient live &gt; 20 mile hospital face similar distance relate treatment barrier Participants must : diagnosis diabetes mellitus average HbA1c level &gt; 7.5 % prior 6 month clinically significant symptom depression Verification diabetes mellitus diagnosis base data collect VA data warehouse . To verify participant meet depression criterion , investigator use participant selfreport clinically significant depressive symptom accord PHQ9 , score great than/equal 10 PHQ9 signify clinically meaningful symptom burden . The investigator exclude potential participant clinical factor would render telephonebased behavioral activation intervention inappropriate . Specific exclusion criterion : lack regular access telephone significant cognitive impairment ( three error ) establish sixitem screen exam meeting criterion bipolar , psychotic , substanceabuse disorder presence uncorrected hear vision impairment medical chart recommend titrate therapy due prior history significant hypoglycemic event live within 20 mile MEDVAMC . Patients secondarily exclude HbA1C level fall 7.5 % baseline assessment , report suicidal ideation PHQ9 baseline assessment . Patients receive mental health service time study recruitment exclude .
