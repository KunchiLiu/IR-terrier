	<brief_summary>Dermatomyositis inflammatory muscle disorder often associate many skin finding . One skin finding see 50 % individual juvenile dermatomyositis , early onset form condition , 20-30 % adult dermatomyositis patient respond treatment , calcinosis , deposit calcium within skin muscle tissue . In addition cosmetically unappealing , involvement deep tissue calcinosis may lead contracture , shorten muscle , may significant impact function quality life . Unfortunately , know effective treatment dermatomyositis associate calcinosis . However , recent report show medication call sodium thiosulfate effective treating individual calciphylaxis , condition calcium deposit within blood vessel , tumoral calcinosis , genetic form calcification , receive medication vein . In addition , recent advance laser technology lead development method may allow topical medication penetrate deep layer skin . The investigator design pilot study evaluate use topical sodium thiosulfate solution treat superficial calcinosis individual juvenile adult dermatomyositis . The investigator use laser assist delivery medication area calcinosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Five individual meet eligibility criterion take part study . They variety assessment perform throughout treatment period order evaluate dermatomyositis calcinosis severity potential response fractional carbon dioxide sodium thiosulfate treatment . A medical history take baseline assessment perform screening period . Serum creatinine kinase level determine visit repeat end study ( week 20 ) ; level one measure monitor disease activity study . One calcinosis lesion treat , assess , follow . If second calcinosis lesion present , act control ( treat ) . Two week prior first treatment session , optional ( require ) skin biopsy target ( treat ) calcinosis lesion offer first 3 patient â‰¥ 18 year age determine optimal fractional carbon dioxide laser setting use treatment . Area durometer ( device measure hardness ) measurement photographs calcinosis lesion perform week 0,4,8,12,16 , 20 . One x-ray control one x-ray target calcinosis lesion also perform screening period week 20 . Assessment muscle strength , physical functioning , endurance , range motion , well myositis activity outside muscle perform screen period week 8 20 . Myositis damage assessment perform screening period week 20 . Questionnaires assess physical functioning pertaining activity daily live quality life , well quality life relate skin disease calcinosis lesion complete screening period week 8 20 . Treatment target calcinosis lesion fractional carbon dioxide laser topical sodium thiosulfate occur week 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 , 18 . Each patient receive total 8-10 treatment 6 month period . Assessments side effect treatment perform prior treatment session week 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 , 20 .</detailed_description>
