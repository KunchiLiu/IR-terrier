	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Osteoarthritis ( OA ) major impact mobility , disability loss productivity patient . Patients become disabled early life OA . ( 1,2,3 ) Osteoarthritis primarily genetic disease trigger trauma , intra-articular fracture , axis deviation joint overloading , include overweight / obesity . Perhaps common type disease hand OA , debilitate patient change generate rheumatoid arthritis . On hand , among debilitate , knee OA , greatly diminish quality life affect patient . ( 4 ) At Knee Surgery Group Instituto de Ortopedia e Traumatologia Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo ( IOT-HCFMUSP ) - Orthopedics Trauma Institute University São Paulo 's General Hospital - large number young adult patient economically active , advent joint trauma , lead early OA . There also large number people seek group Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) without offer non-surgical alternative treatment . As also patient underwent surgical treatment suffer consequence OA clinical treatment current need . These patient receive appropriate OA clinical care . Those patient reabsorb basic health network . But patient return social service IOT-HCFMUSP , reference Unified Health System The OARSI concerned publish guideline respective level evidence various form treatment osteoarthritis knee hip . Those guideline show importance education , phone call , non-drug method physical therapy , exercise , acupuncture , mind body therapy , use insole orthotics , cane , crutch knee pad , finally drug pain slow progression disease . ( 5,6 ) It believe education program positive impact quality life patient OA . In England , simple delivery educational material show different course associate delivery educational material . But country like Sweden , primary care concern give course OA . In France , teach pathology associate medical consultation superior simple medical consultation improve patient ' symptom treatment adherence . ( 6 ) No paper telephone follow-up perform , addition patient care phone , always show well result single intervention . ( 6 ) The Osteometabolic Diseases Group IOT-HCFMUSP , initially focus care osteoporosis diseases bone metabolism thalassemia osteogenesis imperfecta . More recently take care research treatment OA , start knee OA , since 's among prevalent debilitate type OA . ( 3 ) Obesity knee OA frequent comorbidities elderly United States ( U.S. ) . Although present level obesity U.S. patient , patient OA also overweight , often diabetes hypertension . Changing habit patient imperative clinical improvement . Those patient incorporate healthy eat habit well daily physical activity . But change behavior , necessary : - perceive problem important serious . - perceive behaviour change beneficial . Patients prone health information present term potential gain ( 11 ) gain present patient sex race . ( 12 ) We diverse population patient level education range illiterate patient university level . With diversity patient , number patient easily reach four digit , total lack possibility referral patient primary secondary care city São Paulo , design pilot program three phase : Phase 1 - Creation educational program consist various health professional educate patient OA disease , role treatment . This program administer single day review / reinforce interval time . Half patient monitor monthly phone question specific health area make participant . This way evaluate strength telephone follow-up . We 're go create educational print audiovisual material patient , access information give theoretical course home . Calculation cost-effectiveness presentation data authority . Phase 2 - If demonstrate effectiveness improve quality life patient , hold train course health professional West Region Project create system reference cross-reference primary secondary care center . Patients course demonstrate improve quality life , accompany closer home western region São Paulo . Phase 3 - Expansion city São Paulo city . In pilot , focus exclusively Phase 1 . The variable interfere patient compliance program , therefore , final result , : - Length Interval intervention ( 1 , 2 3 month ) - Phone follow-up - Attending course receive educational material GENERAL OBJECTIVES To assess improvement quality life patient osteoarthritis exposed education program multi-professional / telephone follow-up . Develop knowledge , experience indicator support expansion project : West Region Project Municipal Programs , State National . Subprojects : Social Work - improve quality life introduction leisure Nutrition - Decrease body mass index ( BMI ) improve quality quantity diet . Physical Therapy - Improves autonomy , function pain introduction daily exercise habit . Occupational Therapy - Improves autonomy , function pain improve ergonomics and-administration daily task . Physical Education - Improvement autonomy , function pain introduction daily exercise habit . Psychology - Improving quality life patient behavior change induce intervention . METHODS Two hundred forty patient public , healthcare IOT-HCFMUSP , already identify OA knee Given inclusion criterion , patient undergo pre-assessment group compose multi-professional team physician , orthopedic surgeon , nutritionist , psychologist , physiotherapist , occupational therapist , social worker , physical educator : Orthopedics - We treat patient accord OARSI guideline , offer everything disposal treatment OA IOT-HCFMUSP . Thus , orthopedic surgeon : 1 . - request evaluate exam , classify disease knee x-ray , 2 . - prescribe medication delay disease ( work diacerein service ) , analgesic , muscle relaxant , Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) , necessary , 3 . - prescribe orthotics ( insole , knee pad , stick crutch , brace ) ; 4 . - report Social Security Departamento de Transportes ( DETRAN ) - Transports Department ( , social service confirm need ) ; 5 . - Apply evaluation questionnaire SF 36 , Visual Analog Pain Scale ( VAS ) , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) first visit six month , make referral physiotherapy physical activity network offer government , refers acupuncture / dry needle physiatry IOT-FMUSP cardiac evaluation clearance physical activity . Apply Consent Report patient . Each professional staff ass effect intervention personalize way subproject : Nutritionist - anthropometric Social Worker - Level education , autonomy limited mobility hospital . Psychologist - ass cognitive ability , application World Health Organization Quality Life ( WHOQOL ) Physical Therapist - ass range motion , pain , strength quality life . Occupational Therapy - range motion quality life . Physical Educator - Evaluate physical capacity prescribe appropriate exercise patient . The 240 patient randomly assign 4 group 60 . 3 group subject 2 intervention , vary time interval intervention : Group 1 3 month apart Group 2 - 2 month apart Group 3 - 1-month interval Group 4 receive print material . Patient Flow Interventions take place Saturdays IOT-HCFMUSP , use classroom dependency physiotherapy . We `` home simulation '' teach ergonomics home . The course take place 8:00 17:00 hour . Course Schedule - 30 student per week 7:00 Reception patient 8:00 Opening 8:10 Orthopedics Class 8:30 Psychology Class 9:30 Interval - Morning Snack 10:00 Theoretical Lecture - Physical Therapy 10:20 Theoretical class - Occupational Therapy 10:40 Practices : Physical Therapy ( 15 student ) Occupational Therapy ( 15 student ) 12:10 Lunch 13:00 Practices : Physical Therapy ( 15 student ) Occupational Therapy ( 15 student 14:30 Nutrition 15:20 Physical Education 15:50 Interval - Afternoon Snack 16:20 Fitness Physical Educator 16:30 Social service 17:00 Closure COURSE CONTENT 1 st Intervention Education program 8 hour , multidisciplinary team , cover following : Psychologist disease , role team patient treatment self-care Nutritionist basic balance food Social Worker importance leisure experience advice place close home recreation physical activity Physiotherapist Importance exercise , activity home , experience Occupational therapy deal daily activity limitation cause OA Physical Educator Differences physical activity exercise importance patient OA Orthopaedist disease treat daily self-care . The program take place Saturdays IOT - HCFMUSP , 8 17 pm 50 % group ( number 30 patient group 1A , 2A , 3A , 4A ) receive monthly follow-up phone . Groups 1B , 2B , 3B , 4B , receive phone call . 2nd Intervention Education program 8 hour , multidisciplinary team order check reinforce learn first intervention .
