	<brief_title>A Study JNJ-40346527 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( individual know identity study treatment ) , dose-escalation study evaluate clinical efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ; study body drug ) JNJ-40346527 . Up 38 subject could enrol Phase 1 portion study 30 subject could enrol Phase 2 portion study . During Phase 1 portion study , dose escalation JNJ-40346527 start 150 mg ( Cohort 1 ) daily maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) high plan dose ( 600 mg daily ) ; twice daily dosing may also perform deemed necessary . A Study Evaluation Team ( SET ) review available data 1 cycle ( 21 day ) treatment cohort additional dose escalation occur also determine recommend Phase 2 dose expansion cohort . This study consist 3 period : screening period ( sign inform consent immediately dose ) , open-label treatment period ( first dose study drug end-of-treatment visit ) , follow-up period ( end-of-treatment visit ) . All patient participate screen treatment period . Patients administer JNJ-40346527 continuously disease progression , unacceptable toxicity ( base investigator assessment ) . The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events use grade toxicity throughout study . Disease response assess accord Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( base investigator assessment ) occur . Only patient discontinue study drug disease progression discontinue due treatment-related Grade 3 high toxicity continue follow-up period . Serial PK sample collect Cycle 1 detail protocol . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
