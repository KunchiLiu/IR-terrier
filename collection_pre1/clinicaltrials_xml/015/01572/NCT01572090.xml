	<brief_title>Comparison Weight Loss Induced Bariatric Surgery vs Conventional Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite recognition obesity serious public health problem due well-known increased risk development type 2 diabetes hypertension , coronary heart disease , sleep-breathing disorder , certain form cancer , among others , prove extraordinarily difficult halt pandemia . Strictly speak obesity refer excess weight weight height ratio . In fact , World Health Organization define obesity state increase adipose tissue sufficient magnitude produce adverse health consequence . Thus , order well define effect benefit weight loss important address impact body fat change . Given limited approve anti-obesity drug , main therapeutic strategy involve either conventional treatment bariatric surgery . The main modifiable factor affect energy balance dietary energy intake energy expended physical activity . In spite difficulty achieve relevant sustain weight loss via conventional approach , patient successful reduce weight obesity-associated complication . Bariatric surgery prove effective long-term treatment weight loss comorbidity improvement . While surgery-induced benefit directly dependent adipose tissue reduction , others due specific gastrointestinal change take place early significant effect body weight observe . Noteworthy , currently available bariatric procedure differ impact aspect . The present study contemplate determination comparison anthropometric metabolic change produce conventional surgery-induced treatment modality . Particular emphasis place potential differential effect conventional surgical weight loss energy intake , energy expenditure , body composition change , circulate adipokines gastrointestinal hormone together subsequent impact cardiometabolic risk factor . The conventional weight-reduction program ( CONV ) pursue safe weight loss rate 0,5-1,0 kg per week . The surgery-induced weight loss achieve two frequently use bariatric operation , sleeve gastrectomy [ SG ( implies restrictive component ) ] Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [ RYGB ( combine restrictive malabsorptive component ) ] . The purpose study determine effect three weight loss procedure differ manipulation anatomical functional characteristic gastrointestinal tract . While conventional treatment gastrointestinal system remain intact , SG stomach manipulate opposed RYGB , stomach small intestine operate . Since bariatric surgery well know induce partial total remission type 2 diabetes mellitus , effect three different weight loss procedure assess separately obese normoglycemic obese type 2 diabetic individual .</detailed_description>
