	<brief_summary>Chronic renal failure serious complication lung transplantation especially patient cystic fibrosis . Their medical history prior Lung Transplantation already expose kidney damage . Post-lung transplantation , patient subject renal toxicity anticalcineurins receive large dos . The measurement renal function patient formula estimate GFR routine use unreliable marker seem indispensable . The purpose study evaluate two marker , PIIINP ( Procollagen III aminoterminal peptide N ) , whose urinary level correlate intensity fibrosis different type kidney disease .</brief_summary>
