	<criteria>Age ≥18 &lt; 85 year The patient present firsttime acute , anterior wall STEMI schedule undergo primary PCI stenting . The patient symptom cardiac ischemia ≥10 minute . The patient must demonstrate anterior wall STEMI &gt; 0.1 mV STsegment elevation least two contiguous precordial lead ( i.e. , V1V4 ) presume new left bundle branch block . The time onset symptom cardiac ischemia anticipate time initial PCI balloon inflation exceed four ( 4 ) hour anticipate doortoballoon time &lt; 2 hour . For female patient childbearing potential , adequate form contraception must adhere prior entry study 3 month followup visit . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior entry study . Female patient childbearing potential ( i.e . female patient postmenopausal since last regular menses , surgically sterilize least 1 year prior screen visit ) eligible enter study . For male patient female partner childbearing potential , adequate form contraception must adhere prior entry study 3 month poststudy medical . Written inform consent obtain strictly adhere write guideline local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) / Ethical Committee ( EC ) . Exclusion Criteria Cardiogenic shock maximal systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &lt; 80 mm Hg fluid and/or vasopressor resuscitation least two consecutive reading . Ongoing vasopressor support . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic BP &gt; 180 mm Hg diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg least two consecutive reading . Cardiac arrest arrhythmia require prolong ( &gt; 5 minute ) chest compressions/ cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . Prior myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ( ICD ) permanent pacemaker ( PPM ) unless know MRI safe . The presence MRIcompatible pacemaker MRIcompatible hardware contraindication participation trial . Known leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % prior qualifying infarct .
