	<brief_summary>Background : - Anemia occur commonly associate poor outcome elderly . In third anemia case older people ( age 65 ) , cause anemia unexplained . Anemia old adult may cause bone marrow 's inability produce red blood cell fast enough replace old red blood cell die . Researchers want look unexplained anemia study life span red blood cell young adult old adult . To , vitamin call Biotin use marker red blood cell . Objectives : - To investigate possible cause unexplained anemia old people . Eligibility : - Individuals follow group : - Men woman 18 50 year age anemia - Men woman least 70 year age anemia . - Men woman least 70 year age iron-deficiency anemia . - Men woman least 70 year age anemia know cause . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants overnight stay first study visit . They provide blood sample Biotin add . The blood sample Biotin return participant . Twenty-four hour later , another blood sample collect . - Participants 14 additional study visit . At visit , blood sample collect measure amount Biotin remain blood . - Participants may also provide separate blood sample genetic testing . These test may provide information genetic cause unexplained anemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anemia occur commonly associate adverse outcome elderly . In approximately one third anemia case patient age 65 year , cause anemia readily apparent ( unexplained anemia UA ) . Of various cause anemia young adult , overt hemolysis ( either acute chronic ) uncommon . However , speculate old person tend develop low grade hemolytic process significantly reduce RBC survival , adequately counter increased bone marrow RBC production , anemia ( UA ) consequence . This hypothesis support clinical observation . For example , red cell patient UA generally small peripheral blood smear examine microscopically , anisocytosis ( vary cell size ) observe , typical patient hemolytic anemia . Similarly , UA frequently associate elevate red cell distribution width ( RDW ) electronic measurement . Furthermore , serum erythropoietin level gradually rise advance age ( 1 ) , would consistent either smolder hemolytic process decrease responsiveness erythropoietin . To address hypothesis UA due , least part , shorten RBC survival , propose directly measure red blood cell survival correlate aspect red blood cell physiology may increase susceptibility hemolytic process .</detailed_description>
