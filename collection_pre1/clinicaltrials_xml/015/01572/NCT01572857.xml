	<brief_summary>The measurement 24-hour proteinuria allow assessment treatment response patient multiple myeloma . But difficult restrictive make . This study therefore design investigate correlation ratio proteinuria / creatinine sample , easy obtain , 24-hour proteinuria assess response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Protein/Creatinine Ratio Single Urine Sample Versus 24-hour Proteinuria Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measure 24-hour proteinuria important biomarker multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma often accompany proteinuria overhead secretion plasma cell large quantity immunoglobulin free light chain ( FLC ) kappa lambda . This proteinuria compose monoclonal FLC . The measure urinary concentration FLC important biomarker diagnosis evaluation response treatment light chain multiple myeloma also intact immunoglobulin multiple myeloma . The 24-hour proteinuria couple urine protein electrophoresis standard method measure concentration urinary FLC . However , difficult obtain reliable collection urine 24 hour make difficult assess response therapy patient . It would interest assess proteinuria single urine sample collect time day . Contribution urinary protein/creatinine ratio assessment proteinuria glomerular origine . For reason convenience , extent 24-hour proteinuria increasingly abandon nephrologists favor urinary protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) . The use UPCR measure sample urine overcomes inaccuracy relate collection 24 variation urine concentration . This report validate 24-hour proteinuria screen monitor renal glomerular disease French Society Nephrology . In theory , UPCR measure urine sample , take preferably morning . In practice , precision measurement time day quite acceptable . Using urinary protein/creatinine ratio assessment response multiple myeloma ? The use UPCR validate patient renal glomerular disease especially diabetic nephropathy . However , UPCR validate assessment proteinuria overload see myeloma . Two recent paper study UPCR multiple myeloma . The result article suggest : - That UPCR well correlate 24-hour proteinuria - The UPCR varies time depend response treatment could therefore used monitor patient treatment However , give limit , two article alow recommend widespread use UPCR instead classic 24-hour proteinuria clinical practice yet . Prospective study need analyze correlation UPCR proteinuria 24 hour assess response therapy .</detailed_description>
