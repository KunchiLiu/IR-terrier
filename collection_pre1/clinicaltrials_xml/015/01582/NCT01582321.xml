	<brief_summary>Inflammation key initiate damage factor many illness include infection , arthritis cancer also particular relevance study diseases heart blood vessel ( i.e . cardiovascular disease ) . Much evidence exist demonstrate male sex increase one risk cardiovascular disease . More recent evidence demonstrate inflammatory response female appear dampen comparison age match male . Since inflammation think key initiate phenomenon many cardiovascular disease state investigator examine difference acute inflammatory response sex healthy volunteer impact function blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We know one early event involve precipitate disease heart blood vessel phenomenon inflammation inflammation key process involve dampen protective nature inner lining ( endothelium ) blood vessel wall , call endothelial dysfunction . In healthy artery endothelium release number factor maintain health blood vessel . These factor act keep blood vessel open dilate state prevent furring vessel actively inhibit cell component blood collect endothelium block flow blood artery . Recent research animal demonstrate one key component inflammation i.e . attraction white cell , reduce female compare male due reduce expression key protein call 'adhesion molecule ' , particular molecule call P-selectin , endothelium . We wish determine whether similar difference white cell attraction adhesion molecule exist sex human whether difference might underlie difference endothelial function . To investigate possibility conduct study two part , use well validate model acute inflammation healthy volunteer . Part 1 To determine whether response inflammation differ sex part 1 use cantharidin-induced model acute inflammation . Previous publish study show cantharidin apply skin cause acantholysis blister formation . It safe , reproducible technique permanent scar ill-effects . We study effect inflammatory response measure level cell inflammatory mediator blister fluid , urine plasma . Participants give two blister harvest 24 hour ( acute phase ) 72 hour ( resolution phase ) cantharidin application . The effect inflammation blood vessel also study non invasive blood pressure measurement . Part 2 To determine whether susceptibility inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction distinct sex part 2 use typhoid vaccine induce mild inflammation throughout body include blood vessel . Previous publish study show vaccination induces acute inflammation result temporary ( reverse within 48h ) dysfunction endothelium measure use range non-invasive technique call ultrasound flow-mediated dilatation pulse wave velocity . We use technique together biochemical measurement determine possible association endothelial dysfunction specific inflammatory factor . In particular investigate possibility difference expression adhesion molecule P-selectin might role play difference sex .</detailed_description>
