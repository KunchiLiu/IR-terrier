	<brief_summary>The goal Part I clinical research study find high tolerable dose TPI 287 give bevacizumab patient glioblastoma . The goal Part II learn TPI 287 give bevacizumab help control glioblastoma well bevacizumab give alone . The safety drug combination also study . TPI 287 similar type chemotherapy drug call taxane design block protein ( tubulin ) help cancer cell divide . By block tubulin , drug may able cause cancer cell shrink stop growing . Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part I Part II Study : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 3-6 participant enrol Part I study . After , 90 participant enrol Part II . If Part I , assign receive 1 4 dose level TPI 287 base join study . The first 3-6 participant receive start dose level . The next 3-6 participant receive high dose intolerable side effect see low dose intolerable side effect see . Your dose may lower side effect . All participant receive bevacizumab dose level entire study . If Part II , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . If one first 20 participant Part II , randomly assign group . If enrol first 20 participant , likely enrol group show good result . - If Group 1 , receive bevacizumab . - If Group 2 , receive bevacizumab TPI 287 . If disease get bad time treatment bevacizumab alone , may enroll Crossover Group receive TPI 287 bevacizumab . Other Drugs : If take TPI 287 , give standard drug Benadryl® ( diphenhydramine ) cimetidine help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Drug Administration : There 42 day study cycle . Part I : - On Days 1 22 every cycle , receive TPI 287 vein 1 hour . - On Days 1 , 15 , 29 every cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 30-90 minute . Part II : If Group 1 : ° On Days 1,15 , 29 every cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 30-90 minute . If Group 2 Crossover Group : - On Days 1 22 every cycle , receive TPI 287 vein 1 hour . - On Days 1 , 15 , 29 every cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 30-90 minute . Study Visits Part I , Group 2 , Crossover Group Part II : Every time receive study drug ( ) , vital sign record end infusion . On Days 1 , 15 , 22 , 29 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1- 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . On Days 1 , 15 , 29 Cycle 1 , urine collect kidney function test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Urine collect kidney function test . - You MRI scan brain check status disease . On Days 15 , 22 , 29 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Study Visits Group 1 Part II : Every time receive study drug ( ) , vital sign record infusion . On Days 1 , 15 , 29 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect kidney function test . On Day 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - Your medical history performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Urine collect kidney function test . - You MRI scan brain check status disease . On Day 15 29 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At time study , extra test may perform doctor think need safety . The study doctor tell extra test . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug ( ) long doctor think best interest . If enroll Crossover Group , may continue take study drug 6 additional cycle Crossover Group . You may longer able receive study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 28 day stop study drug : - Your medical history performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Urine collect kidney function test . - You may MRI scan brain check status disease . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month end-of-treatment visit 1 year , call asked feeling . This call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . TPI 287 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment brain tumor , include glioblastoma . The combination TPI 287 bevacizumab glioblastoma investigational . Up 108 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically prove glioblastoma gliosarcoma eligible protocol . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma anaplastic glioma ( WHO II III ) subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma gliosarcoma make . Only patient histologically proven image proven recurrent glioblastoma gliosarcoma eligible protocol . 2 . Patients must show unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence progression MRI scan fail radiation temozolomide therapy . The scan do prior study entry document progression review treat physician document change tumor dimension confirm recurrence . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis . 3 .
