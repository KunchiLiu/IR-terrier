	<detailed_description>This study open label , multicenter study two phase : The Phase IB part study dose escalation study lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) administer orally 3 week every 28-day cycle , combination fix dos obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma patient . The Phase II part study efficacy study association recommend dose lenalidomide associate GA101 2 separate population patient : relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma ( diffuse large B-cell lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma : cohort 1 ) , relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma ( cohort 2 ) previously untreated follicular lymphoma ( cohorts 3 4 ) . First , patient receive combination obinutuzumab lenalidomide total 6 cycle . Patients achieve least partial response 6 cycle receive maintenance treatment obinutuzumab 2 year Lenalidomide 1 year tolerate , disease progression .</detailed_description>
