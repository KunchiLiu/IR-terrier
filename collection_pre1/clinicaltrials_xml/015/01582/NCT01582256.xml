	<brief_summary>The study aim investigate whether neuropsychological function ( particularly cognitive flexibility executive function ) , functional ( assessed rest functional MRI , rfMRI ) structural connectivity ( assessed DSI ) , electrophysiological function ( assess event-related potential [ ERP ] : mismatch negativity , MMN P50 ) effective cognitive endophenotypes ( biomarkers ) Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) common severe , multi-factorial , highly heritable , clinically genetically heterogeneous , life-long impair childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder . Due high prevalence severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention pharmacological treatment , disastrous disease prioritize epidemiological , molecular genetic biomarker study world . Specific aim : 1 . To validate structural functional connectivity fronto-temporal , cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry effective imaging endophenotypes demonstrate difference ASD probands CNVs finding ( n=22 ) unaffected sibling ( n=22 ) , probands without CNVs known genetic marker relate ASD ( n=22 ) unaffected sibling ( n=22 ) , match neurotypicals ( n=22 ) ; 2 . To validate neuropsychological functioning ( particularly set-shifting executive function ) effective neuropsychological endophenotypes demonstrate difference among six group ; 3 . To validate electrophysiological functioning assess ERP effective neurophysiological endophenotypes demonstrate difference among 6 group ; 4 . To correlate data structural functional connectivity , neuropsychology , electrophysiology involve alter brain functioning . The investigator anticipate probands CNVs may higher level decreased structural functional connectivity , impaired ERP neuropsychological functioning probands without CNVs . The alteration structural functional connectivity , neurophysiological neuropsychological functioning would observe unaffected sibling compare neurotypical participant . If CNV probands prove de novo mutation unaffected sibling result , likelihood different functioning unaffected sibling neurotypical participant would decrease . The genetic dosage ( CNV , rare mutation moderate large clinical effect , versus multiple common variant small effect , regard unaffected sibling , neurotypicals ) anticipate pose strong effect microstructural integrity white matter , follow functional connectivity electrophysiological function , neuropsychological function least effect .</detailed_description>
