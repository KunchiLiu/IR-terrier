	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies show change breast density ( amount white area woman 's mammogram ) may relate change breast cancer risk . Currently , ideal way measure breast density repeatedly time . Researchers want test whether ultrasound tomography scan show change breast density . To examine change , healthy volunteer history breast cancer woman take tamoxifen ultrasound tomography scan . Objectives : - To test whether ultrasound tomography scan show change breast density relate tamoxifen exposure . Eligibility : - Women 30 70 year age ( ) take tamoxifen ( b ) healthy volunteer never breast cancer . Design : - All participant screen visit . Healthy volunteer one additional study visit ; woman take tamoxifen three additional study visit . - All participant screen physical exam medical history . They also give blood saliva sample . This visit also include initial ultrasound tomography breast scan . - For healthy volunteer : - At study visit ( 12 month screen visit ) , participant short interview weigh . They also ultrasound tomography breast scan provide blood sample . - For woman take tamoxifen : - At second third visit ( 1 3 month 3 6 month start tamoxifen ) , participant short interview . They also weigh ultrasound tomography breast scan . - At fourth visit ( 12 month start tamoxifen ) , participant short interview , weight measurement , ultrasound tomography breast scan , also provide blood sample . - All participant may follow 5 year final study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Ultrasound Study Tamoxifen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated breast density one strongest risk factor non-familial breast cancer [ 1 ] . Recently , International Breast Cancer Intervention Study-1 ( IBIS-1 ) trial report woman whose mammographic density decline 10 % within 12-18 month initiate tamoxifen chemoprevention also mark reduction cancer risk [ 2 ] ; however , preliminary data suggest 30 % patient , tamoxifen fail low density reduce cancer risk . Therefore , hypothesize breast density represent biosensor tamoxifen response , reflect bioavailability action active drug metabolite . Distinguishing tamoxifen responder non-responders early time point would value make informed treatment decision , provide rationale continued therapy among responder spar non-responders exposure ineffective treatment . We propose use novel ultrasound tomography ( UST ) scanner repeatedly assess volumetric breast density among 150 woman first year tamoxifen use clinical indication , include referral health professional base woman personal risk breast cancer diagnosis atypical lobular ductal hyperplasia ( ALH/ADH ) , ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) , invasive breast cancer , ass whether tamoxifen-related decline mammographic density find 12 month identify earlier UST . UST ideally suit application produce volumetric data avoids artifact secondary breast compression exposure potentially harmful ionize radiation . For comparison , perform UST group 150 age- , race- , menopausal status-matched woman without breast cancer order ass change UST density time without tamoxifen exposure . The specific goal project utilize UST describe early time course volumetric breast density change . The broad objective ass concept breast density biosensor tamoxifen response UST useful tool make determination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Subjects : Aged 30 70 baseline visit ; Weight le equal 350 lb ; Not currently pregnant breastfeeding ; No breast implant currently ; No active skin infection wound overlie breast ; The breast , visually assess , fit ultrasound tomography ring ( i.e. , 20 cm diameter ) ; No serious medical psychiatric illness would prevent voluntary informed consent . Cases : Is plan take tamoxifen clinical indication include : 1 . A referral health care professional base woman personal risk breast cancer ( i.e. , BRCA1/2 mutation carrier 5year predict risk breast cancer great equal 1.66 % accord gail model [ 30 ] ; OR 2 . A diagnosis invasive , estrogen receptor positive breast cancer , ductal carcinoma situ , lobular carcinoma situ , atypical lobular ductal hyperplasia affect one breast ; AND 3 . Has never diagnose breast cancer breast contralateral current diagnosis ; Is receive currently plan take chemotherapy . Screennegative Comparison Group : The recent mammogram result recommendation continue routine screening ( i.e. , BIRADS diagnostic score 1 `` 2 '' ) ; Not currently take oral contraceptive menopausal hormone therapy ; Not previously diagnose breast cancer receive medication radiation type cancer ; Not take medicine ( tamoxifen raloxifene ) low breast cancer risk .</criteria>
