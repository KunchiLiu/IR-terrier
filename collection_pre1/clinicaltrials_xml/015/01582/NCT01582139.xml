	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Closed Loop Control Type 1 Diabetes Using Heart Rate Monitoring Exercise Marker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination Control Range system cell phone call `` Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) Platform '' . The purpose study see investigational technology help control blood sugar people type 1 diabetes mellitus insulin pump therapy successfully use supervised hospital setting . This study also do see give information heart rate Closed-to-Range System reduce hypoglycemia relates exercise . Subjects exercise exercise bike clinical research unit . During one exercise test session , Closed-to-Range System receive information heart rate ( Experimental Condition ) . During exercise test session , Control Range System receive information heart rate ( Control Condition ) . This part study do see whether heart rate information help Closed-to-Range System reduce occurrence exercise-related hypoglycemia . The Closed-to-Range system two part ( module ) work together separately . A . The Safety Supervision Module ( SSM ) help prevent low blood sugar . It reduce amount basal insulin pump deliver alert carbohydrate need help prevent low blood sugar . This module active time operation Closed-to-Range System . B . The Hyperglycemia Mitigation Module ( HMM ) help prevent high blood sugar . It instruct insulin pump deliver small bolus help prevent high blood sugar . It also help warn possible pump problem blood sugar level respond insulin . The Closed-to-Range System work insulin pump continuous glucose monitor help keep blood sugar desire range ( 80-180 mg/dL ) day help avoid hypoglycemia night .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . ≥21 &lt; 65 year old clinical diagnosis Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus least 1 year . 2 . Criteria document hyperglycemia ( least 1 criterion must meet ) : 1 . Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL confirm 2 . Twohour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) glucose ≥200 mg/dL confirm 3 . HbA1c ≥6.5 % document confirmed 4 . Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL symptom 3 . No data diagnosis available participant convince history hyperglycemia consistent diabetes . Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( least 1 criterion must meet ) : 1 . Participant required insulin diagnosis continually thereafter 2 . Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) require insulin eventually use continually 3 . Participant start insulin diagnosis continue hyperglycemic , positive islet cell antibody consistent latent autoimmune diabetes ( LADA ) adult require insulin eventually use continually . Criteria Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( least 1 criterion must meet ) 4 . Documented low absent Cpeptide level . 5 . Documented presence Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies ( ICA ) Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase ( GAD65 ) antibody . 4 . Use insulin pump treat his/her diabetes least 6 month 5 . Actively use bolus calculator current insulin pump predefined parameter carbohydrate ( CHO ) ratio , insulin sensitivity factor ( ISF ) , target glucose 6 . HbA1c 5.0 % 10.5 % measure DCA2000 equivalent device 7 . Not currently know pregnant , breast feeding , intend become pregnant ( female ) 8 . Demonstration proper mental status cognition study . 9 .

If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , stability medication least 2 month prior enrollment study . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Clinical diagnosis Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 2 . Diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 month prior enrollment 3 . Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 3 month prior enrollment 4 . Pregnancy , breast feeding , intention become pregnant 5 . Uncontrolled arterial hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg ) 6 . Hematocrit &lt; 36 % ( female ) ; &lt; 38 % ( male ) 7 . Uncontrolled thyroid disease thyroid replacement determine thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) UVa reference range . 8 . Impaired hepatic function measure alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal 9 . Impaired renal function measure creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL 10 . Conditions may increase risk hypoglycemia know coronary artery disease ( e.g . history myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , therapeutic coronary intervention , coronary bypass stenting procedure , stable unstable angina , episode chest pain cardiac etiology document EKG change , positive stress test catheterization coronary blockage &gt; 50 % ) , congestive heart failure , history cerebrovascular event , seizure disorder , syncope , adrenal insufficiency , neurologic disease atrial fibrillation 11 . Additional condition may inhibit ability perform exercise stationary bike ( e.g . injury immobility limb , neuromuscular disease , exerciseinduced asthma require inhaler use within last 12 month clinically impaired pulmonary function ) 12 . Use medication significantly lower heart rate ( beta blocker , reserpine , guanethidine , methyldopa , clonidine , cimetidine , digitalis , calcium channel blocker , amiodarone , antiarrythmic drug , lithium ) 13 . History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans 14 . Use device may pose electromagnetic compatibility issue and/or radiofrequency interference continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) ( implantable cardioverterdefibrillator , electronic pacemaker , neurostimulator , intrathecal pump , cochlear implant ) 15 . Medical condition require use acetaminophencontaining medication withheld study admission . 16 . Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g . inpatient psychiatric treatment within 6 month prior enrollment , uncontrolled anxiety panic disorder ) 17 . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation 18 . Current recent alcohol drug abuse patient history 19 . Medical condition would make operating CGM , cell phone insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , immobility ) 20 . Any skin condition prevents sensor pump placement abdomen arm ( e.g . bad sunburn , preexist dermatitis , intertrigo , psoriasis , extensive scarring , cellulitis ) 21 . Known microvascular ( diabetic ) complication ( diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy ) , history laser coagulation , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , know diabetic nephropathy ( microalbuminuria normal creatinine ) neuropathy require treatment 22 .
