	<brief_summary>The study open label , multicenter , randomize ( three arm : DOT ( standard control ) , SAT , SAT SMS reminder ) control clinical trial . The trial conduct patient diagnosed latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) recommend treatment . The primary objective evaluate adherence three-month ( 12-dose ) regimen weekly rifapentine isoniazid ( 3RPT/INH ) give directly observe therapy ( DOT ) compare self-administered therapy ( SAT ) . The secondary objective : - To compare treatment completion rate participant randomize SAT without reminder versus SAT weekly SMS reminder - To evaluate timing dos pattern adherence weekly RPT/INH among participant complete treatment discontinue therapy prior completion . - To determine availability acceptability use SMS reminder among patient consent participate study . - To determine toxicity tolerability compare rate drug-related grade 3 4 adverse event death DOT arm SAT arm ( combine individually ) - To compare frequency , timing , cause failure complete treatment DOT arm SAT arm - To collect patient-specific cost data relate 3 treatment arm - To describe pattern antituberculosis drug resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain culture participant develop active TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 33 : Adherence Latent Tuberculosis Infection Treatment 3HP SAT Versus 3HP DOT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate approximately 2.3 billion people infected Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Approximately 1.7 million people die TB year , second common infectious cause death world . In order improve TB control worldwide , affordable , effective , short course treatment latent TB infection ( LTBI ) global priority . Candidates LTBI treatment person positive TST IGRA , particularly also risk factor progress active TB , include individual likely recently infect . The Prevent TB Study ( TBTC Study 26 ) open-label , randomize , phase III control clinical trial 8,000 high risk TST reactor enrol . The study compare rifapentine INH ( 3RPT/INH ) give once-weekly directly observe treatment ( DOT ) 3 month ( 12 dos ) compare 9 month daily , self-administered INH . The result demonstrate safety efficacy short regimen . Moreover , weekly therapy significantly higher treatment completion rate standard 9 INH regimen . One effective strategy assure adherence therapy dose medication directly administer health care worker observe record ingestion drug . DOT active TB successfully use many setting improve treatment completion , however cost logistical constraint DOT remain . The estimated cost give 12 weekly DOT dos LTBI patient likely prohibitive TB control program worldwide . This may lead decrease uptake new regimen implementation use SAT adherence study . Therefore , apply Prevent TB study result broadly , new study evaluate treatment completion 3 RPT/INH give SAT conduct . Medication adherence define whether patient take treatment prescribe . The effectiveness treatment determine largely adherence . In clinical practice research , indirect measure adherence commonly use . Indirect measure adherence include patient self-report , evaluation pharmacy dispensation record , pill count , use electronic prescription bottle monitor . Patient self-reported adherence accurate non-adherence report tends overestimate true adherence . Self-report discern enough utilized sole measure adherence research setting adherence primary outcome . Pill count utilized successfully research clinical setting real-time assessment also tend overestimate adherence . Electronic drug monitor Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) best available tool assess timing pattern adherence . This study use combination indirect measure include MEMS , pill count , self-report provide accurate assessment adherence weekly , self-administered RPT/INH . The number cellular phone user globally increase dramatically last decade . Cell phone SMS reminder use successfully randomize control clinical trial improve adherence vaccine , HIV medication , asthma treatment . SMS appear cost-effective way reach patient remote location . This study examine effect SMS medication adherence . The goal open label clinical trial compare adherence 3RPT/INH give DOT versus SAT SAT weekly SMS reminder . The primary assessment adherence treatment completion define take least 90 % dos ( 11/12 dos drug ) within 16 week initiation . Secondary objective include evaluate pattern adherence participant fail complete , determine feasibility impact use SMS reminder treatment completion SAT , evaluate tolerability adverse event associate treatment arm , monitoring development active TB , determine drug susceptibility participant develop active TB , measure important patient-related expenditure associate study arm . The trial conduct patient diagnose LTBI recommend treatment .</detailed_description>
