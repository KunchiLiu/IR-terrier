	<detailed_description>Screening test Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer ( HNPCC ) [ also call Lynch Syndrome ] , among available validated genetic test recommend evidence-based practice save life . However , half patient meet well-established accept screen criterion receive screening . This critical failure patient health-care delivery system HNPCC mutation carrier exceptionally high risk colorectal HNPCC-related cancer , clinical strategy prevent future cancer , provide early detection , individual affect HNPCC relative . HNPCC test also cost-effective compare treating individual diagnosis colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . To address shortfall practice , propose research mobilize resource integrate health-delivery system extensive electronic clinical data implement evaluate new strategy maximize screen CRC patient HPNCC . The Evaluation Genomic Applications Practice Prevention ( EGAPP ) work group recommend newly diagnose CRC patient screen HPNCC , able recommend best-strategy accomplish aim . Therefore , use Practical Robust Implementation Sustainability Model ( PRISM ) , develop one co-investigators , guide analysis , investigator : Aim # 1 : Conduct randomize control trial determine effectiveness universal laboratory test-based HNPCC screen program compare current practice physician referral self-referral . Aim # 2 : Elucidate patient , provider , system factor important success implementation . Aim # 3 : ( revise approve year 1 ) : To create , refine , disseminate implementation guide HNPCC screen combine result Aims 1-2 perspective informant interview key staff future diverse dissemination-implementation site : Case Western Reserve University , Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University , MD Anderson Cancer Center , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Kaiser Permanente Georgia , Kaiser Permanente Hawaii , Safety Net West Clinics . Addition Aim 3 : We contribute material LSSN website dissemination implementation material . This study aim evaluate implementation novel HNPCC screen program ass , stakeholder , facilitator barrier program implementation success . Results study help achieve Healthy People 2020 objective reduce CRC mortality . It add grow literature increasingly important area translate research finding real-world practice , subject NIH Roadmap . Many finding useful clinical area broadly applicable health care organization aim improve access genetic test cancer .</detailed_description>
