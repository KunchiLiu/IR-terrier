	<detailed_description>GBS post-infectious immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy highly diverse clinical course outcome despite partially effective form treatment ( immunoglobulins plasma exchange ) . Outcome patient GBS improve last two decade . At present 10 20 % patient remain severely disabled 5 % die . One explanation stagnation highly variable clinical course GBS lack knowledge factor determine clinical course individual patient GBS . GBS may consist distinct pathogenic subgroup , disease onset progression influence different type precede infection , anti-neural antibody genetic polymorphism . Optimal treatment individual patient may depend pathogenesis clinical severity . Patients severe form GBS may possibly need intensive treatment recover . Patients milder course fully recover standard therapy could suffer possibly side effect aggressive form treatment . This could possible prognostic model accurately predict clinical course individual patient . Ideally model base clinical biological predictor strongly associate disease course know early possible acute phase illness , treatment immunomodulatory therapy effective . Prognostic model could help guide selective trial specific GBS subtypes . Because possible treat GBS effective individual therapy . This study aim identify clinical biological determinant predictor disease course outcome individual patient Guillain-Barré syndrome , early possible onset disease . This information use understand diversity clinical presentation response treatment GBS . This information also use develop new prognostic model predict clinical course outcome accurately individual patient GBS . To address research question require conduct prospective study standardize collection clinical data biomaterials large group well-defined GBS patient long follow-up period . Such extensive study relatively rare disease GBS address intensive international collaboration .</detailed_description>
