	<brief_summary>The purpose study clinical , technological organizational impact telestroke service Nordlandssykehuset , Bodø , two small rural hospital Lofoten Vesterålen . The stroke specialist Bodø examine patient cooperation doctor local hospital video- sound communication . Radiology image transmit use RIS/PACS system . Telestroke consultation may useful ass whether patient need thrombolysis medication , also whether need advance specialist neurological neurosurgical treatment , support quick triaging transfer appropriate unit . The study design multi-method approach use before-and-after hospital information data well registration form monitor patient outcome pathway . The research question approach medical , organisational technological perspective . A telestroke service North Norway expect face challenge report internationally : In Nordlandssykehuset , Helse Nord general , number case low , clinician high turnover , technical support available 24/7 severe weather condition long distance might add transport time . Primary hypothesis : The use telestroke lead faster accurate diagnosis proper treatment Secondary hypothesis : Telestroke lead improve overall patient treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telestroke Nordland Hospital . A Study Telemedicine Network Rural Hospitals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There good evidence prognosis patient ischemic stroke improved thrombolysis acute phase . The challenge narrow time window : Thrombolysis give soon possible later 4.5 hour first symptom . In Norway , approximately 2 % stroke patient receive thrombolysis whereas 20 % expect benefit treatment ( The Norwegian Directorate Health , 2010 ) . The low rate could due geographical condition long travel distance , lack awareness population , also little experience treatment local hospital may play role . The overall aim project improve health outcome stroke patient telemedicine . This study investigate potential outcome stroke patient small rural hospital use telestroke service . The project study `` patient flow‟ analyse hospital information system ( HIS ) data well monitoring teleconsultations log main purpose result consultation . This conduct throughout project , analyse period 18 month . Hospital data diagnosis , thrombolysis frequency , stroke complication like haemorrhage stroke recidive , used analysis process . Around 60 case may potentially include study 18 month observation period , compare register data patient study . Control-groups consider , find ethical since telestroke equipment already instal two hospital . Log information Norwegian Health Net use videoconferencing use basis field observation interview verify actual use system . Corresponding log data , semi-structured interview conduct make follow-up phone call hospital staff telestroke incident . Using qualitative approach , number follow-up call decide process , add app 20 case . This method use capture happen concrete telestroke incident first call hospital throughout process , detail session still fresh . There also period fieldwork three hospital . This include observation hospital ward concrete telestroke consultation . Semi-structured focus group interview conduct health personnel involve stroke-patients , include ambulance personnel , doctor nurse , well technical support . Fieldwork take place early project phase , interval project period . Fieldwork follow-up phone interview different time research period capture potential change stroke treatment time .</detailed_description>
