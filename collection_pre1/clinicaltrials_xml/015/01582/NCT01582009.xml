	<brief_title>Panobinostat Everolimus Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Renal Cell Cancer That Does Not Respond Treatment With Sunitinib Malate Sorafenib Tosylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability determine recommend dose combination LBH589 Everolimus patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . ( Phase I ) II . To assess preliminary evidence tumor response patient treat LBH589 Everolimus . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate effect LBH589 Everolimus progression-free survival event rate . ( Phase II ) IV . To determine clinical response rate LBH589 Everolimus patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity combination LBH589 Everolimus patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate effect LBH589 Everolimus time-to-tumor-progression ( TTP ) , disease-free survival overall survival . ( Phase II ) III . To assess pharmacodynamic effect LBH589 Everolimus peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMNC ) tumor accessible treatment , available . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate modulation tumor metabolism blood patient treat LBH589 Everolimus FDG 015 water PET/CT scan . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study panobinostat everolimus , follow phase II study . Patients receive oral panobinostat daily day 1 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 oral everolimus daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
