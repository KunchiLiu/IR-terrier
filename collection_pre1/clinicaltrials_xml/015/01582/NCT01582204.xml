	<brief_summary>Usually , doctor monitor kidney cancer CT scan measure size tumor . Sometimes , even drug working , take several month effect see regular CT scan . The purpose study see new kind scan , call 124I-cG250 PET/CT , determine response sunitinib pazopanib earlier regular CT scan . Research show certain protein blood , call antibody , attach cancer cell without bind normal cell . In study , antibody use call chimeric G250 ( cG250 ) attach radioactive isotope . The radioactive isotope study Iodine-124 ( 124I ) . If cG250 attach tumor body , 124I show PET scan .</brief_summary>
