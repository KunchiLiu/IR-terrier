	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess perianal perirectal fistula healing ( complete closure ) base endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) evaluation 3 month PDAI ( Pouchitis Disease Activity Index ) Fistula Drainage assessment 6 month , show fistula ( new recurrence ) treatment Crohn 's ' disease patient Certolizumab ( Cimzia ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS Evaluation Perianal Peri-rectal Fistulizing Crohn 's Disease With CERTOLIZUMAB Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peri-anal ( locate around anus , open rectum outside body ) fistulae major complication Crohn 's disease occur almost 30 % patient . Patients perianal fistula suffer severe pain , perianal drainage , significant impairment quality life . Initial study Infliximab Adalimumab patient CD show perianal fistula heal medication . Infliximab Adalimumab medication reduce effect substance body cause inflammation . They also use treat Crohn 's disease drug try without successful treatment symptom . Although study specifically evaluate Certolizumab ( Cimzia ) treatment fistulizing Crohn 's disease , evidence efficacy . Certolizumab reduce effect substance body cause inflammation . Certolizumab use treat symptom Crohn 's disease drug try without successful treatment symptom . Studies small number patient use Cimzia show significant effect fistula closure . However , large subgroup patient fistulae PRECiSE 2 43.3 % receive 3 induction injection certolizumab follow placebo , 53.6 % certolizumab 400mg continuous treatment fistula closure define drainage gentle compression least 50 % open fistula 2 consecutive visit , least 3 week apart . Perianal disease activity usually monitor clinically . In clinical study , two evaluation method use attempt unify definition perianal disease activity . One method perianal Crohn 's disease activity index ( PDAI ) involve question regard discharge , pain/ restriction activity , restriction sexual activity , type perianal disease , degree induration ( score &gt; /=5 indicate active disease , decrease PDAI 2 point indicate improvement , consider 0 heal . PDAI scale ( Pouchitis Disease Activity Index ) . This scale analyze summarizes different criterion : clinical , endoscopic histological . Among clinical symptom , important factor number stool exceed post-operative average , bleeding , re-occuring stomachache , well body temperature 37.8°C 100°F . `` Pouchitis '' term describe inflammatory change pouch create low part ileum . The patient suffer high body temperature , stomachache watery stools small amount mucus , blood soiling . An exam base technique , use Precise trial Fistula Drainage Assessment indicate improvement remission closure individual fistula define fistula drainage despite gentle finger compression , improvement define decrease baseline number open drain fistulae great equal 50 percent least 2 consecutive visit ( i.e . least 4 week ) , remission define closure fistula drain baseline least 2 consecutive visit ( i.e. , least 4 week ) . However validate , response level usually evaluate several month treatment . If another method could provide early assessment / predictor heal , could make decision treatment gastroenterologist well patient , easy determine continue biologic stop . Studies evaluate use endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) follow fistula assessment healing , none specifically assess response certolizumab treatment . EUS increasingly use find equally accurate evaluation perianal fistula compare MRI pelvis . An accurate assessment classification fistula facilitate management include surgical planning , medical treatment , combination . EUS evaluate fistula well abscesses relation anatomic landmark rectum include sphincter muscle well adjacent organ vagina bladder . EUS advantage convenient patient MRI . An MRI take long duration , cause anxiety claustrophobic , expensive . EUS usually perform sedation treat physician allow personal evaluation fistula anatomy correlation endoscopic mucosal finding . Thus , propose evaluate use certolizumab Crohn 's disease patient peri-anal peri-rectal fistula ( abnormal passage lead abscess hollow organ part body surface one hollow organ part another ) ass response healing ( A perirectal abscess collection pu deep tissue surround anus . Perirectal perianal abscess think develop gland surround anus ) base EUS finding . This study help provide recommendation fistula classification EUS use classification provide EUS - base early predictor response treatment certolizumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Conventional therapy indicate nonbiologic therapy . Study subject would fail conventional standard regimen treatment immunomodulators ( azathioprine , 6mercaptopurine , methotrexate ) mesalamines corticosteroid . Certolizumab actually approve regimen treatment Crohn 's disease patient perianal fistula fall moderately severely active disease . It offlabel indication , therefore would require IND . The study goal look EUS tool determine fistula heal occurs use certolizumab one biologic therapy use treat fistulizing Crohn 's disease . Crohn 's disease patient perianal perirectal fistulizing disease . Moderate severe Crohn 's disease patient age 18 70 year active perianal perirectal fistula . Preexisting fistula improve current medical therapy . Contraindication certolizumab use . Prior use antiTNFalpha .</criteria>
