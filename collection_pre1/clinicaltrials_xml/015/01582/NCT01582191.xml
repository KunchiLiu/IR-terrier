	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination vandetanib everolimus give patient advanced cancer . The effect study drug different dose level safety study drug also study . Vandetanib everolimus design harm cancer cell , stop growth . This may stop slow growth spread cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Trial Vandetanib ( Multi-kinase Inhibitor EGFR , VEGFR RET Inhibitor ) Combination With Everolimus ( mTOR Inhibitor ) Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level combination vandetanib everolimus base join study . Up 5 dose level vandetanib everolimus test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see low dose . This continue high tolerable dose combination vandetanib everolimus find . Study Drug Administration : You take study drug mouth 1 time every day . The number pill take day depend dose level . The study staff tell many pill take give detailed direction take study drug . Everolimus take cup ( 8 ounce ) water , without food . Swallow everolimus whole . Do chew , break , crush everolimus , unless swallow whole . In case , crush everolimus tablet mix 2 tablespoon water able swallow whole . Vandetanib take without food . Do chew , crush , break vandetanib . Vandetanib swallow whole OR mix vandetanib water . To , mix pill ( ) 1/4 cup water 10 minute drink ; rinse cup ½ cup water drink . You ask fill pill diary time take everolimus vandetanib . The pill diary give study cycle . They bring every clinic visit . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect . Within 14 day Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - If 3 day since screen test , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . At Weeks 1 2 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect Week 1 Before Cycle 2 every cycle first 6 month : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 ½ teaspoon ) drawn test blood sugar . - You ECG ( every 2 cycle ) . After complete 6 month study tolerate treatment well , see per every cycle . Before Cycle 3 , every odd number cycle ( Cycles 5 , 7 , ) : - Blood ( 2-5 teaspoon ) draw test fat sugar level blood . You need fast ( eat drink anything water ) least 4 hour blood draw . - You x-ray , CT scan , PET scan , MRI scan check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug doctor longer think best interest , disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur . You may choose stop take study drug time . You tell study staff doctor right away think stop participation study . The study staff doctor talk safely stop take study drug . You may ask return follow visit check side effect happen . End-of-Study Visit : If study doctor think need , may end-of-study visit 14 28 day last dose study drug . The following test procedure perform : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You may electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . - If able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . This investigational study . Vandetanib FDA-approved commercially available treatment medullary thyroid carcinoma . Everolimus FDA-approved commercially available treatment pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , subependymal giant cell astrocytoma , renal cell carcinoma . The use drug combination treatment advance cancer investigational . Up 174 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
