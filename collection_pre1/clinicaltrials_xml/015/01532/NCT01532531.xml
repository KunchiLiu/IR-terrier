	<brief_summary>Collateral meridian therapy ( CMT ) recently develop technique accord traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) experience , differ traditional Chinese acupuncture numerous manner . CMT involve manipulation distant non-painful collateral meridian , thereby facilitate dissipation pain . The technique avoids direct stimulation involve meridian , enhance patient tolerability prevents injury disease painful area . Numerous clinical case report effectiveness CMT pain management . This study test whether CMT effective treat knee OA pain functional recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Knee OA patient age 60 year older recruit orthopedic clinic Taichung Armed Force General Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan . All patient clinically radiologically diagnose knee OA accord criterion American College Rheumatology Lawrence radiographic change tibiofemoral joint use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain score high 30 mm 100-mm scale medial side knee walking . Individuals undergone total knee arthroplasty , exhibit uncontrolled hypertension , history cardiovascular disease , suffer neurological disorder affect low extremity function exclude study . Patients receive conflict ongoing intervention acupuncture , hyaluronan injection , intra-articular corticosteroid , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation thermotherapy also exclude . Patients drug treatment include change medication occur , dosage administer one month longer . Oral paracetamol non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) permit rescue pain medication duration study . Rescue pain medication change medicine dosage record . This study approve IRB Tri-Service General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan write informed consent obtain enrolled participant . According seal envelop method , enrol patient randomly allocate control group CMT group . Treatment CMT group The CMT group patient receive , accord CMT protocol describe previously , CMT select point CMT Electrotherapy Stimulator ( `` GEMORE '' Multi-Function Electrotherapy Stimulator ; GM390TE , GEMORE Co Ltd , Taiwan ) treat affect OA knee . In brief , knee OA mostly induce knee pain medial side , correspond disease meridian OA AxI/3 , first yin meridian ( AxI ) knee region ( `` 3 '' ) medial aspect low extremity ( spleen meridian TCA ) . A reduction technique , remove obstruct overflowed Qi , perform treat point `` 3 '' ipsilateral third yang meridian ( TyIII ) dorsal aspect upper extremity ( TyIII/3:3 ) , correspond Tze Cheng ( SI7 ) small intestine meridian TCA ; aspect share control C-point ( first `` 3 '' ) F-point ( second `` 3 '' ) divert obstruct Qi obstruct diseased meridian healthy one ; C-point use link diseased meridian treatment healthy meridian ; manipulate F-point treatment/removal disease/pain symptom . An enhancement technique perform treat contralateral meridian `` Ax II/2 : ( 3 ) , '' represent treat `` 2 '' C-point `` 3 '' F-point , number parenthesis signifies usage enhancement technique contralateral second yin meridian medial aspect low extremity ( correspond San Yin Jiao ( SP6 ) Lou Ku ( SP7 ) , respectively , liver meridian TCA ) . The 6-minute treatment ( electrotherapy set 40 Hz biphasic 30 mA ) comprise reduction enhancement procedure specific point ( figure 1 2 ) . Each patient receive CMT twice per week three week study . Control ( CT ) group The patient CT group receive electronic lead-patches apply treatment point , identical CMT group receive , also 6 minute , though electric stimulation apply . Evaluation outcomes Primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) pain intensity activity , quantify 100 mm VAS ( 2 ) pain disability measure Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC , 0-96 point ) . The WOMAC disease-specific measure pain , stiffness , physical function individual knee OA . The WOMAC comprise 5 item related pain , 2 item related stiffness , 17 item related physical function . Each item score 5-point Likert scale ( 0-4 ) . The reliability validity WOMAC score establish . The VAS WOMAC score measure immediately independent staff first treatment , subsequently one , two , three week , three month first treatment . Statistical analysis Patients exclude analysis present follow-up , outcome assess . The Mann-Whitney test employ analyze difference VAS WOMAC score two group . SPSS software Windows use statistical analysis . All data present mean ( Â±SD ) . The data P value less 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
