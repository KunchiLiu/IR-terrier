	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination erlotinib pralatrexate give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Pralatrexate design block body 's ability make folic acid , protein may help cancer tissue develop spread . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block protein think cause cancer cell grow . Erlotinib may help slow growth tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Combination With Pralatrexate Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level erlotinib pralatrexate base join study . Dose Escalation : Several dose level erlotinib pralatrexate test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant start low plan dos erlotinib pralatrexate . Each new group 3-6 participant receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose erlotinib combination pralatrexate find . Dose Expansion : Once high tolerable dose appropriate combination dose level find , 10 participant take study drug dose level . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . Up 10 day start treatment , start take folic acid help low risk side effect . Although study drug design prevent body make folic acid could help cancer grow spread , folic acid need prevent side effect non-cancerous tissue . You take folic acid mouth 1 time every day treatment least 30 day receive last dose pralatrexate . Up 10 day start treatment , receive vitamin B12 injection . You receive injection Vitamin B12 every 3 month . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , receive pralatrexate vein 3-5 minute . You take erlotinib hydrochloride mouth 1 time day every day . You take erlotinib hydrochloride empty stomach either 1 hour eat 2 hour eat . You take erlotinib home except day study visit . You take time day cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask current health condition , drug take , side effect . If screening test perform within 7 day Cycle 1 , test procedure may repeat . At time Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight least 1 time per cycle . - Your vital sign measure . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test see well blood clot . - If take part expansion phase , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . At time Cycle 2 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight least 1 time per cycle . - Your vital sign measure . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If take part expansion phase , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD testing . About every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or positron emission compute tomography ( PET ) /CT scan check status disease . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) may draw tumor marker test depend type tumor . If study doctor think need , perform less often . At time Cycle 3 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight least 1 time per cycle . - Your vital sign measure . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Dosing : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End Dosing Visit : After finish take study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This investigational study . Pralatrexate FDA approve commercially available treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment pancreatic cancer non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The study drug combination investigational . Up 74 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
