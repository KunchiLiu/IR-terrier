	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , open-label , single institution trial combination intravenous ( IV ) ofatumumab oral GSK2110183 patient relapse refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Patients must receive least one prior line therapy contain fludarabine ( single-agent combination therapy ) . During initial 6 month Treatment Phase , ofatumumab administer weekly 8 dos , every 4 week cycle additional 4 dos ( dose schedule identical pivotal phase 2 trial ) GSK2110183 give daily PO ( Treatment Phase ) . There initial 10 day lead-in GSK2110183 alone prior initiation ofatumumab allow evaluation change cell surface expression due GSK2110183 GSK2110183 pharmacokinetic study ( Lead-in Phase ) . The official Cycle 1 Day 1 start date first dose ofatumumab . Cycle duration = 4 week . Patients assess safety , disease assessment , response , survival day 1 cycle Treatment Phase . A formal review safety data Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) first 6 patient complete cycle 1 Treatment Phase perform continue accrual . All patient achieve SD , PR CR end Treatment Phase proceed Maintenance Phase . Patients PD time , include end Treatment Phase , take study . During Maintenance Phase , single-agent GSK2110183 administer daily maximum 12 month ( 12 cycle ) . Maximum duration study drug 18 month ( 18 cycle ) . During Follow-up Phase , patient assess safety , disease assessment , response , survival every 3 month month 36 ( year 3 ) , subsequent CLL therapy death , whichever come first . Key indication study withdrawal progressive disease , intolerable toxicity , completion therapy</brief_summary>
