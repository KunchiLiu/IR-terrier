	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well gemcitabine hydrochloride work without pazopanib hydrochloride treat patient refractory soft tissue sarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether gemcitabine hydrochloride effective without pazopanib hydrochloride treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Refractory Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate whether treatment gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) plus pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) improve median progression-free survival patient metastatic soft tissue sarcoma compare gemcitabine plus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate population gemcitabine plus pazopanib compare gemcitabine plus placebo . II . To assess overall survival population gemcitabine plus pazopanib compare gemcitabine plus placebo . III . To investigate difference treatment response different histologic subgroup ( liposarcoma vs. eligible soft tissue sarcoma subtypes ) . IV . To evaluate safety tolerability combination gemcitabine plus pazopanib . V. To assess progression-free survival response rate patient treat single agent pazopanib follow administration gemcitabine cross-over portion study . VI . To collect specimen exploratory analysis potential biomarkers predict response patient receive combination therapy gemcitabine plus pazopanib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 placebo PO day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression may receive single-agent pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
