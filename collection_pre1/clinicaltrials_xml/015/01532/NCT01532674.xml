	<brief_summary>The goal study determine patient chronic periodontitis undergo scale root planing ( SRP ) plus photodynamic therapy comparison SRP alone result improved clinical , microbiological biochemical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical , Microbiological Biochemical Effects Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research orientate find effective way kill oral microorganism cause periodontitis gingivitis problem resistance , happen use antibiotic . The efficacy low power laser demonstrate numerous field medicine use year . The application photodynamic therapy easy since fill periodontal pocket photosensitive agent apply low power laser area . The photosensitive agent stain bacteria immediately laser disrupts membrane free-radical reaction . Improving health status patient week treatment .</detailed_description>
