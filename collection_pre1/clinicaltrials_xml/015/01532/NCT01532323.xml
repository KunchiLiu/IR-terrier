	<brief_summary>In Human , oral sphere first main place sensory stimulus receive perceive . The phenomenon occur food breakdown sensory perception complex system saliva play major role . In neonatal period , severe digestive disease require cessation oral feeding use enteral parenteral nutrition prolong period ensure growth development child disease active . The early stage sensory oral exposure consequence development eat habit child poorly document . It likely process acquisition preference eat habit atypical `` bypass '' oral sphere early stage feed . Thus , orally feed , child get expose wide variety taste texture first year life , may impact oral acceptance later age . These oral disorder ( OD ) express refusal eat , heighten gag reflex , refusal certain consistency difficulty chew swallowing . Few data available food typically accept child . Finally , oral sensory phenotype OD child ( gustatory sensitivity ... ) describe yet . It likely may differ significantly healthy ( NOD ) . In context , population OD child particularly interest study effect absence learn stage consequence development sensory perception eat habit . The investigator formulate hypothesis lack exposure standard oral diet would modify development `` oro-sensory system '' include saliva . Studying population great opportunity ass influence non oral food exposure diet saliva characteristic . Saliva recently receive attention potential easy collect source biomarkers several condition exclude OD . The potential impact OD salivary composition never study . Several study link saliva perception preference conduct UMR CSGA ( Unité Mixte de Recherche du Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation ) . They already contribute highlight great inter-individual variability number saliva marker change saliva protein profile response taste stimulation They also underline remarkable intra-stability saliva flow composition one year study . This study intend prove concept relevant relate saliva characteristic food intake behaviour food habit The first hypothesis test study salivary profile ( biological signature ) discriminate two group child differ orality . The second hypothesis test specific biological biological signature may correlate certain food habit associate oral disorder .</brief_summary>
