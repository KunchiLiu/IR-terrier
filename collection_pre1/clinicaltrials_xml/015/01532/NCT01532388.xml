	<detailed_description>Background : The aim study investigate effect Internet-based screen brief intervention ( SBI ) site problematic alcohol drug use among illicit drug user . Method : Individuals search information alcohol drug online score 0 Drug Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test ( DUDIT ) 15 year older recruit trial randomize one group receive Internet-based screening brief intervention via eScreen.se ( n = 101 ) one assessment-only control group ( n = 101 ) . Both group screen baseline follow 3 6 month . The primary outcome measure DUDIT-C score secondary outcome measure DUDIT , AUDIT-C ( Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test-C ) AUDIT scores.Additional outcome include proportion drug abstainer make clinically signiﬁcant change alcohol drug use . Four statistical model analysis use conservatively assess result . Results : A signiﬁcant decrease DUDIT-C score 3-month follow-up occur group . Three four statistical model show large decrease DUDIT score intervention group control group ( p = 0.006 ; p = 0.046 ; p = 0.001 ) . Two model show continued decrease AUDIT-Cand AUDIT score also 6-month follow-up intervention group control group.No additional difference occur . Conclusions : The result inconclusive provide evidence SBI sit eScreen.se could effective short-term reduction problematic substance use .</detailed_description>
