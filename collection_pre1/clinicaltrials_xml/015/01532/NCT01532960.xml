	<brief_summary>Despite advance surgical , radiation medical therapy early stage breast cancer , patient experience disease recurrence . Because recurrence may happen year definitive treatment , period time resection relapse micrometastatic disease may amenable immune eradication modulation . While ultimate goal cancer treatment clinical efficacy , immediate urgency breast immunotherapy define treatment immunologic efficacy . In study , investigator determine whether vaccine consist nine-class I breast specific peptide plus class II tetanus toxoid helper peptide immunogenic administer poly-ICLC participant stage IB IIIA breast cancer adjuvant setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Breast Cancer Vaccine Plus Poly-ICLC Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single arm , open label , pilot study safety immune efficacy peptide vaccination poly-ICLC patient stage IB-IIIA resected breast cancer . Participants patient complete last dose/treatment single treatment combination adjuvant surgery , radiation , chemotherapy trastuzumab therapy 45 day 6 month ( 180 day ) prior enrollment . Each vaccination administer day 1 , 8 , 15 , 36 , 57 , 78 . All participant receive 9 class I MHC-restricted synthetic peptide ( restrict HLA-A1 , -A2 , -A3 , -A31 ) class II MHC-restricted tetanus helper peptide mix 1mg poly-ICLC administer sterile water . The vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) ( 1 ml ) intradermally ( ID ) ( 1 ml ) vaccination sit arm leg . ( Each vaccine give IM ID one site ; site alternate arm site opposite breast cancer anterior thigh site . ) Participants screen HLA type must HLA-A1 , -A2 , -A3 , -A31 ( 80 % Virginia population prior studies1 ) . Annual follow-up progression survival 3 year study withdrawal/completion .</detailed_description>
