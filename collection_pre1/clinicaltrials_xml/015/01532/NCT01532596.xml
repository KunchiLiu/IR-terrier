	<detailed_description>It well establish mindfulness meditation intervention improve wide-range mental physical health outcome stress patient population , although underlying mechanism currently unknown . It suggest mindfulness training may reduce reactivity stimulus improve regulation , although mechanism examine ( use functional neuroimaging ) . Additionally , well-established loneliness inflammation major risk factor morbidity mortality old adult , although currently unknown whether mindfulness meditation training may reduce risk factor . The purpose propose study test mindfulness meditation training ( vs wait-list control condition ) reduce neurobehavioral reactivity improve affect regulation sample healthy old adult , measure functional magnetic resonance imaging . Additionally , examine whether mindfulness meditation training reduces loneliness marker inflammation .
