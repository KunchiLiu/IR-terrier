	<brief_title>The Effect Priming Intravenous Rocuronium Fentanyl-Induced Coughing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fentanyl widely use analgesia anesthesia rapid onset , intense analgesic effect , associate lessen cardiovascular depression low histamine release . Although cough reflex usually transient self-limiting , avoid situation elevate intracranial , intraocular , intra-abdominal pressure , unstable hemodynamics . The cause FIC unclear . One hypothesis vocal cord spasm might induce cough fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity histamine release . Muscle relaxant commonly use treat condition . This study hypothesize prim muscle relaxant could prevent suppress FIC . This study investigate whether muscle relaxant rocuronium attenuate FIC effectively .</detailed_description>
