	<brief_summary>Seriously ill patient may develop complication call acute lung injury ( ALI ) , form inflammation lung tissue fill fluid contain white blood cell call neutrophil . ALI common often fatal ( example USA estimate 190,000 patient develop ALI per annum , 75,000 die ) . No pharmacological treatment show improve ALI . Data animal model patient strongly suggest neutrophils central disease progression . However bedside method exist rapidly accurately determine seriously ill patient , neutrophils present release damage enzymes elastase . As , investigate team develop synthesised clinical grade , image agent call NAP ( Neutrophil Activation Probe ) detect activate neutrophil also damage enzyme , human neutrophil elastase ( HNE ) . The investigator extensively test NAP animal model efficacy safety . It reliably detect activated neutrophil toxic . NAP small molecule deliver tiny dos ( call microdoses ) area inflammation human lung bronchoscope . The activity NAP visualise image though tiny camera also introduce bronchoscope . This camera system widely use throughout world 150 site . The investigator therefore aim test utility safety NAP exploratory clinical study . The study involve delivery NAP 6 healthy volunteer follow deliver NAP 3 patient ICU pulmonary infiltrates 6 patient know bronchiectasis . In healthy volunteer study , healthy male volunteer recruit University Edinburgh invite participate . In ICU study , patient recruit ICU Royal Infirmary Edinburgh . In bronchiectasis study , patient recruit respiratory service NHS Lothian . If study ( support Medical Research Council ) demonstrate safety also ability image activate neutrophil , investigator intention design future study patient ALI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) /adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) clinically important ( 16 % mechanically ventilate patient acquire ALI , one third die ) , yet pharmacological therapy show impact significantly outcome . This part due inadequate stratification patient neutrophil predominant ALI/ARDS inability determine disease activity hence target therapy . Molecular Imaging ( MI ) offer potential strategy visualize neutrophil activity vivo situ . Indeed FDG PET use image neutrophil activity bedside modality , move critically ill patient remote scanner dangerous expensive currently bedside 'smart ' MI solution guide , cellular/functional level , diagnostic therapeutic pathway patient inflammatory lung disease . Indeed , ICU , specific need rapidly diagnose patient deteriorate gas exchange , particularly chest X-ray ( CXR ) shadow . Such CXR infiltrates result numerous cause include cardiac failure , fluid overload , secondary pneumonia ALI/ARDS . All require different treatment , present , option distinguish condition severely limit , result empirical 'blunderbuss ' antimicrobial therapy non-correction primary condition . There press need rapidly stratify patient inform focused implementation specific target therapy . Activated neutrophils histotoxic product , particularly human neutrophil elastase ( HNE ) , specifically implicated pathogenesis ALI/ARDS , considerable clinical interest new drug area . However , currently way rapidly determine whether new therapeutic candidate exert predicted effect situ human lung prior embark upon major clinical trial . Such solution would inevitably accelerate pathway new drug clinical application . The Proposed Solution : probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) combine direct intra-pulmonary instillation microdoses ( pharmacologically-inactive non-toxic ) highly specific sensitive 'smartprobe ' ( NAP ) detect neutrophil activity presence active HNE lung ventilate ICU patient . pCLE safely provide high-resolution , real-time image human lung cellular resolution situ . Alone , however , provide functional molecular information . The investigator therefore embark discovery programme synthesise highly sensitive smartprobes , detectable pCLE specifically direct key inflammatory event . This provide new dimension clinical application cutting-edge technology . NAP , prototype validate vitro vivo effective dose &lt; 10Âµg generates powerful fluorescent signal &lt; 30 sec . Our pilot study aim apply combine utility pCLE NAP healthy volunteer patient inflammatory lung disease . The study also provide prototypic foundation apply future smartprobes , lung organ accessible endoscopy . The primary end-point proof concept demonstration technique use visualise activate neutrophil background autofluorescence . Other end point include safety . The investigator shall also assess alveolar ( bronchoscopy ) neutrophil activation elastase activity patient . Demonstration activate neutrophils pCLE ICU would expect lead directly clinical trial patient ALI/ARDS .</detailed_description>
