	<brief_title>Oxytocin Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress important predictor relapse , target stress-activated pathway may lead therapeutic advancement treatment substance use disorder . Oxytocin show promote trust , social bonding , calmness ; however , potential effect explore cocaine-dependent individual . Oxytocin receptor localize brain region activate drug-paired cue preclinical study show oxytocin attenuates acute long-term behavioral effect psychostimulants . However , little known role oxytocin mediate affective response cocaine-paired cue associate neural activity cocaine-dependent men woman . This project direct evolution previous SCOR-supported research . Our work progress characterize sex/gender difference response social stressor cocaine cue cocaine-dependent men woman , on-going work evaluate whether stress potentiate cue-induced crave impact hormone response . The propose study investigate role oxytocin sex/gender difference stress response crave cocaine-dependent individual preliminarily explore therapeutic potential .</detailed_description>
