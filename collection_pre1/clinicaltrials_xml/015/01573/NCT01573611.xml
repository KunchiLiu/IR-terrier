	<brief_summary>Constituents grape study antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , anticarcinogenic property . In past decade , emerge evidence regard potential role grape slow cognitive decline effect age . Furthermore , evidence obtain vivo supplementation age rat grape seed extract improve cognitive performance . Despite promise accumulate data support use grape safe effective strategy delay incidence dementia , remain unclear grape intake would useful respect factor dose schedule stage dementing illness . In general , well-controlled experimental data obtain human subject need much development . The investigator aim measure effect grape intake cerebral metabolism cognitive function , determine whether initial pattern , magnitude change , cerebral metabolism assess positron emission tomography ( PET ) serve respectively predictor , biomarker , magnitude cognitive change result intake grape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People experience mild cognitive change represent epidemiologically major segment geriatric patient population . Numerous study carry study benefit grape associate dementia Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . In present proposal , investigator aim determine 1 ) whether cognitive regional cerebral metabolic change associate grape powder use identify , 2 ) presence magnitude therapeutic response grape patient mild cognitive decline predict particular pattern regional brain metabolism , 3 ) change identify , magnitude change correlate magnitude change note neuropsychologic parameter examine , might useful objective biomarker therapeutic effect . A total 12 patient suffer documented decline cognitive function ( absence overt dementia ) study . In placebo-controlled , double-blinded study , 12 recruited subject meet screen criterion randomize receive 72 g grape powder per day placebo . The subject undergo baseline brain PET study radiotracer [ F - 18 ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) . In addition , neuropsychological assessment perform baseline six month initiation therapy . Follow-up PET scan also obtain six month assess change metabolism occur therapy regimen .</detailed_description>

Subjects age 65 recruit , order enhance clinical relevance project focus age group serious concern early sign symptom senile onset dementia typically emerge . Already diagnosed Alzheimer 's disease cause dementia Cognitive dysfunction impair subject 's ability perform activity daily live .
