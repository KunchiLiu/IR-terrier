	<detailed_description>Recruitment occur phone clinic Practice Based Research Network ( PBRN ) use attached screener . Prior contact , patient identify potentially eligible current past diagnosis depression indicate Regenstrief Medical Records System . These potentially eligible person must approve study moderate-intensity exercise primary care provider recruitment call screener PBRN . The telephone screener use PHQ 9 ( Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ) modify Stanford Brief Physical Activity Scale . Those PHQ-9 score 10 great indicate current regular physical activity eligible screening . Following recruitment PBRN , study personnel call confirm PHQ-9 result SCID . If patient pass follow-up screening , staff arrange travel patient 's home . Study staff obtain informed consent perform baseline assessment include Short Form-36 , PHQ-9 , Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 ( GAD-7 ) , Medical Outcomes Study Social Support survey , ASA 24 . The ASA 24 online dietary screener measure energy intake 24 hour period . It post National Cancer Institute 's website . Medication adherence smoking level measure self report . Height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure also measure . With exception SCID , measure repeat 3 month follow-up . The PHQ-9 complete monthly . Also , month ( three different time period ) participant ask wear armband accelerometer measure energy expenditure 2 week period . The protocol give detail accelerometry procedure . Blood drawn use 2 ten ml tube base line 3 month follow-up use procedure describe Data Safety Monitoring Plan . We ask participant fast eight hour prior blood draw , note possible . Appointments blood draw make within five day assessment also take place within participant 's home.. The blood sample measure circulate level proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α , IL-1β , IL-6 , TNF-α ; anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra IL-10 ; acute-phase reactant CRP ; VEGF BDNF . Participants randomize public health low dose exercise . Randomization stratify baseline use/no use prescription anti-depressants . Both low public health exercise arm receive supervise one one instruction via video conference . The exercise occur five time week 10 30 minute session . During twelve week intervention , exercise increase intensity may include wrist ankle weight . During session , participant rate perceive exertion use Borg 's Rating Perceived Physical Exertion ( RPE ) : 10 Point Scale 0 movement 10 maximum effort . Participants also wear heart rate monitor . Participants low dose exercise arm instruct exercise RPE le 5 heart rate le 50 % age-adjusted maximum ( 200 minus participant 's age ) . The participant public health dose arm instruct exercise RPE 5 7 maintain heart rate 55 70 % age-adjusted maximum heart rate . All assessment blood draw occur participant 's home .</detailed_description>
