	<brief_summary>Background : - Bisphenol A ( BPA ) chemical use primarily make plastic , resin , thermal paper . Most people expose daily low level BPA leach food water plastic product , include water baby bottle . However , risk BPA know . Researchers want learn BPA act body , body get rid BPA . Objectives : - To study controlled exposure BPA effect body . Eligibility : - Healthy , non-obese volunteer 25 45 year age . Design : - Participants five visit 2 4 week study . - At first visit , participant screen physical exam blood urine test . They complete questionnaire exposure BPA-containing product . They also receive list medication take study period . - The second visit last 13 hour . Participants fast 8 hour visit . They single dose d-BPA ( modified form BPA easy study body ) . Regular blood sample take 13-hour visit . All urine also collect . Participants receive breakfast lunch visit . - Participants three follow-up visit . They collect store urine follow-up visit . Blood sample collect follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bisphenol A ( BPA ) utilize primarily manufacture polycarbonate plastic epoxy resin , widely use fabrication baby bottle food lining . Consequently , human exposure BPA widespread . However , still uncertainty extent nature exposures . This pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study aim refine understanding metabolism excretion BPA follow two different route administration . This investigation also intend help resolve current controversy BPA risk assessment . We administer 100 micrograms/kg body weight ( bw ) deuterated BPA ( d- BPA ) orally and/or dermally , 50 participant , comparable number men woman , collect blood urine measurement d-BPA d-BPA conjugate select time point three day period post-dosing . The use d-BPA allow detection administer BPA distinguish background BPA . The primary endpoint study detection measurable d-BPA d-BPA conjugate blood urine administration single dose 100 microgramsg/kg bw d-BPA apply orally and/or dermally . Participants give option complete either one phase study , exposure visit separate period least 4 week . Dose selection base balance need detectable level BPA blood urine meet objective need minimize human subject risk . Data first 3 participant study , receive oral d-BPA , confirm dose oral pilot phase sufficient capture measurable d-BPA blood urine continue 100 micrograms/kg bw d-BPA oral dosing . Dermal exposure consist pilot phase route administration comprise 4 participant assess whether 100 microgram/kg bw d-BPA applied skin sufficient obtain measurable d-BPA blood and/or urine order establish PK parameter evaluate whether time point appropriate necessary . If need , dermal pilot phase repeat use ethanol solution rather carboxymethylcellulose suspension . The design include sufficient sample blood urine define relevant PK parameter , include rate BPA absorption , plasma elimination rate , area curve ( AUC ) apparent clearance , half-life , urinary excretion rate , fractional metabolic clearance glucuronide sulfate conjugate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants meet follow criterion consider admission study : Male female 2545 year age time enrollment . Able fast overnight ( least 8 hour ) . Able understand provide write informed consent English . Able travel NIEHS Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) require study visit . Male female reproductive age agree use contraception avoid conceive child agree donate egg sperm six month follow participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Uncontrolled diabetes : Hemoglobin A1C &gt; 6.5 % fast blood glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL . Known liver dysfunction disease : ALT higher normative value determine abnormal PI . AST higher normative value determine abnormal PI . ALP higher normative value determine abnormal PI . Known kidney dysfunction disease : Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60 ml/min per MDRD equation . Clinically relevant anemia define hemoglobin concentration &lt; 13g/dL male hemoglobin concentration &lt; 11g/dL female . Pregnancy : Positive serum quantitative hCG pregnancy test . Current lactation . BMI le 19 great 35 Medication use : Given widespread use medication , may practical instruct subject avoid medication prior study . Thus , participant exclusion base use medication within 48 hour exposure 3 day follow exposure affect glucuronidation dBPA dosage : Salicylic acid , acetaminophen , ibuprofen , naproxen , mefenamic acid , diclofenac , gliclazide carbamazepine , valproic acid , cimetidine , sulfasalazine , amoxicillin erythromycin . Recent blood donation within past 8 week BPA exposure visit ( exceed donation 10.5 mL/kg 550 mL 8 week period ) .</criteria>
