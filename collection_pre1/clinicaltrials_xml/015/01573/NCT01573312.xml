	<brief_summary>This single center , randomize , double-blinded , control , Phase I , small target prospective study healthy male non-pregnant female subject , 18 49 year old , inclusive , design determine safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity intramuscular subvirion inactivate monovalent influenza A/H5N1 ( HA A/Indonesia/05/2005 ) virus vaccine manufacture Sanofi Pasteur administer 3.75 mcg per dose give without AS03 adjuvant manufacture GSK . In study , subject receive two dos administer 28 day apart . This study use system biology approach ass human early gene protein signature express Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 28 first vaccination . The system data integrated immunogenicity reactogenicity data develop system model human immune response A/H5N1 vaccine without AS03 adjuvant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>H5N1 Vaccination With Without AS03 : Systems Biology Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal project identify RNA protein biomarkers within 1 7 day vaccination peripheral blood predict successful immune response protection disease . Adjuvants use boost response vaccine stimulate innate immune response . However , exact mechanism safety adjuvant still debate . Systems biology study complex biological process integrate system many interacting component . The goal system biology make biology predictive . This proposal use system biology approach identify successful immunization biomarkers . The study use fresh blood sample patient data collect propose VTEU-funded study . At selected time point , volunteer ' blood sample collect immediately process . Using specimen , identify quantify change whole transcriptome proteome major immune cell identify quantify change gene expression . We integrate change gene expression change immune cell response . We use mathematical modeling accumulate data identify RNA protein biomarkers significantly correlate observed serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) response , cytokine/chemokine response , cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) responses . Ultimately , predictive biomarkers foundation simple , rapid , inexpensive test quickly show protection pathogen foreign agent vaccination . This single center , randomize , double-blinded , control , Phase I , small target prospective study healthy male non-pregnant female subject , 18 49 year old , inclusive , design determine safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity intramuscular subvirion inactivate monovalent influenza A/H5N1 ( HA A/Indonesia/05/2005 ) virus vaccine manufacture Sanofi Pasteur administer 3.75 mcg per dose give without AS03 adjuvant manufacture GSK .
