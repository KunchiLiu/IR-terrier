	<brief_summary>Subjects randomize receive either tositumomab ( Anti-B1 Antibody ) iodine I 131 tositumomab ( Arm A ) unlabeled tositumomab ( Arm B ) . Subjects randomize Arm B allow cross receive I 131 tositumomab disease progress long still fulfil protocol entry criterion ( except exclusion criterion 12 , prior monoclonal antibody therapy ) human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) negative . Study endpoint assessment response conduct Masked Independent Randomized Radiographic Oncologic Review ( MIRROR ) panel Study Investigators ' assessment safety survival . Subjects complete least two year follow-up Protocol BEX104515 ( formerly Corixa Protocol RIT-II-002 ) enrol long term follow-up Protocol BEX104526 ( formerly Corixa Protocol CCBX001-051 ) , administrative protocol , continue radiographic response evaluation safety evaluation every 6 month year 3 5 post-treatment annually year 6 10 post-treatment . Subjects BEX104526 assess survival , disease status , subsequent therapy NHL , long-term safety , include use thyroid medication , development hypothyroidism , human anti murine antibody ( HAMA ) , myelodysplastic syndrome , acute myelogenous leukemia , secondary malignancy . Additionally , subject follow development adverse event ( ) deem Principal Investigator possibly probably related subject 's previous treatment Iodine I-131 tositumomab . Laboratory evaluation consist thyroid stimulate hormone level complete blood cell count , differential platelet count , obtain annually year 10 post-treatment . Dosimetric Dose : Subjects receive 450 mg tositumomab IV follow 5.0 mCi Iodine I-131 35 mg tositumomab . Following dosimetric dose , whole body dosimetry perform subject use total body gamma camera . Whole body anterior posterior whole body image obtain follow timepoints . 1 . Within one hour infusion dosimetric dose prior urination 2 . 2-4 day infusion dosimetric dose , follow urination 3 . 6-7 day infusion dosimetric dose , follow urination Therapeutic Dose : The total body residence time , derive total body gamma camera count obtain 3 time point , use calculate iodine-131 activity ( mCi ) administer deliver therapeutic total body irradiation dose 65 75 cGy . The therapeutic step administer 7-14 day dosimetric step consist tositumomab 450 mg follow activity ( mCi ) iodine-131 calculate deliver 75 cGy 65 cGy total body irradiation , depend platelet count , 35 mg tositumomab . For subject ≥150,000 platelets/mm3 , recommend dose activity iodine-131 calculate deliver 75 cGy total body irradiation ; subject NCI Grade 1 thrombocytopenia ( platelet count ≥100,000 &lt; 150,000 platelets/mm3 ) , recommend dose activity iodine-131 calculate deliver 65 cGy total body irradiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Iodine-131 Anti-b1 Antibody Versus Anti-b1 Antibody Chemotherapy-relapsed/Refractory Low-grade Transformed Low-grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II randomize , control , two-arm , open-label , multicenter study compare safety efficacy tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab tositumomab treatment chemotherapy-relapsed refractory low-grade transform low-grade B-cell NHL . Treatment Arm A : Subject undergo 2 phase study . In first phase , term `` dosimetric dose '' , subject receive tositumomab ( 450 mg ) follow tositumomab ( 35 mg ) trace label 5mCi ) Iodine-131 tositumomab . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain day 0 , day 2 , 3 , 4 , day 6 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data three image time point , subject-specific dose iodine I 131 tositumomab deliver desire total body dose radiotherapy calculate . In second phase study , term `` therapeutic dose '' , subject receive unlabeled tositumomab ( 450mg ) follow iodine tositumomab ( 35mg ) label subject-specific dose iodine I-131 deliver whole body dose 75 cGy subject . Subjects platelet count 100,001 - 149,999 cells/mm3 , receive 65 cGy subject obese dos base 137 % lean body mass . Subjects treat either saturate solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior first infusion Iodine-131 tositumomab ( i.e. , dosimetric dose ) continue 14 day follow last infusion radiolabeled tositumomab ( i.e. , therapeutic dose ) . Treatment Arm B : Subjects receive amount unlabeled tositumomab ( 450 + 35 mg ) administer time-frame Arm A study Days 0 7 ( day 7 dose may delay long 14 day first dose ) . Crossover treatment Arm B : Subjects Arm B may crossover receive Iodine-131 tositumomab follow progression lymphoma still fulfill protocol inclusion exclusion criterion ( except exclusion criterion # 12 ) HAMA-negative .</detailed_description>
