	<brief_summary>The investigator new technique look urine see whether contains protein fragment release damage kidney . These fragment seem accurate current blood test investigator use diagnose renal failure . This technique need validated group patient relatively high incidence renal failure , cardiopulmonary bypass . The investigator hypothesise use novel marker renal dysfunction identify patient go develop renal failure earlier , high number standard blood test . The investigator aim collect urine patient go onto bypass , Day 1 Day 2 bypass . This urine analyse protein fragment , well new marker renal dysfunction . The investigator also take blood baseline first two day Cardiac Intensive Care , compare accuracy new test 'gold standard ' creatinine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Novel Biomarkers Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis acute renal failure problematic , review show 35 work definition use literature . This lack clarity give rise ADQI group create terminology acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . AKI use give foundation RIFLE AKIN criterion , show perform well predict critical care hospital mortality . Their criterion base measuring increase serum creatinine baseline level , tally weight-based urinary volume . Problems technique lie accurate baseline creatinine value , MDRD formula often prove inaccurate . Criticisms also level use serum creatinine , give variance different body-mass composition fluid-balance status , well relatively late rise AKI compare utility chronic renal failure . Many novel biomarkers investigate AKI , either serum urine ( cystatin-C , Il-18 , KIM-1 , NGAL ) . Results vary , potential problem lack specificity AKI , cost heterogeneous nature patient population various study . NGAL emerge potentially specific early AKI additionally number commercially available assay available . Interest show use biomarker panel , allow improved sensitivity , albeit high cost . Urinary proteomic analysis use investigative technique AKI last ten year , diverse population lack blind hamper early study . A recent paper use technique develop collaborator proposal improve performance proteomic assay , impressive performance assay look critically ill patient AKI . A problem assess utility diagnostic screening tool AKI critically ill heterogeneity pathological insult , unpredictable early clinical course . This lead difficulty identify control group , capture evolution AKI . We propose investigate use novel biomarkers proteomic technique homogenous group patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass . This carry benefit thorough pre-operative test stable baseline measurement clearly definable renal insult form bypass time . Post-bypass renal failure require RRT estimate occur 1.5-2 % coronary artery grafting case , around 5 % combine graft/valve replacement case ; however , far high incidence AKI measure creatinine rise and/or oliguria . As part standard operative technique patient 's bladder catheterise prior start surgery first 100mls urine void collect baseline sample . Venous blood take cannulation serum spun freeze later analysis NGAL ( emergent biomarkers AKI interest ) . Finger prick blood sampling perform baseline point care analysis NGAL/brain natriuretic peptide use Alere platform . Details intra-operative conduct gather computerised anaesthetic record cardiac perfusionist record include anaesthetic technique ( volatile/TIVA ) , duration bypass perfusion pressure bypass . When Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) 100mls urine collect 24hrs induction anaesthesia , 48 hour . This 'clean ' sample ( ie urine lie overnight ) . Accompanying laboratory value serum creatinine collect diagnosis AKI comparison proteomic value . At point blood take stored NGAL well finger prick measure use point care NGAL/BNP . Copies correspond electronic ICU physiological record collate data relate cardiovascular parameter , diagnosis AKI use vasopressor . APACHE-II score calculate 24 hour post admission addition daily SOFA score . AKI define AKIN stage I ( increase serum creatinine &gt; 50 % baseline measurement , and/or urinary output &lt; 0.5ml/kg/hour six hour ) RRT 48 hour post-surgery . Patient outcomes recorded respect CICU mortality , 90-day mortality , need ongoing RRT , development chronic kidney disease ( move eGFR &gt; 60ml/min/1.73m2 pre-admission eGFR &lt; 60ml/min/1.73m2 hospital discharge ) .</detailed_description>
