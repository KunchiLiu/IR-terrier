	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death disability United States , affect 81 million American adult . It well establish risk factor hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia place individual risk CVD , also place risk neurocognitive impairment dementia . CVD risk factor show associate cascade neurophysiologic neuroanatomic change , result cognitive impairment dementia . Exercise diet show improve CVD risk factor also appear particularly promising lifestyle approach prevent dementia among individual risk , cognitive impairment , dementia ( CIND ) . ENLIGHTEN randomize clinical trial diet exercise among patient CIND .</detailed_description>
