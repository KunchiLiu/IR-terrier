	<detailed_description>Heart failure complex clinical syndrome characterize high prevalence incidence population great risk , therefore , significant social economic impact . Randomized clinical trial , meta-analyzes , observational study control trial clearly demonstrate neuro-hormonal therapy highly effective reduce mortality , hospitalization improve quality life . In recent year electrical therapy play increasingly important role treatment patient chronic heart failure . Such importance mainly due possibility prevent sudden cardiac death implant ICD correct deleterious effect electrical dyssynchrony / leave ventricular mechanic CRT . The CRT proven effective tool reduce mortality , reduce symptom improve quality life patient already receive optimal medical therapy . Despite undoubted benefit electrical treatment add conventional medical therapy , high percentage patient benefit term clinical echocardiographic . The identification non-responders CRT crucial order submit patient unnecessary costly device whose electrical therapy prove ineffective . The reason lack response still unclear factor lead placement , device-settings degree dyssynchrony implant seem important . The purpose study collect parameter ( clinical , electrical , radiographic , echocardiographic ECG ) able predict response cardiac resynchronization therapy .</detailed_description>
