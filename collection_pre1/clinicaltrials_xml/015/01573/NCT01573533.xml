	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Rituximab therapy safe effective treating patient kidney condition , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) , longer responsive traditional therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assess Efficacy Rituximab Therapy Treatment Resistant FSGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial ass safety , feasibility efficacy Rituximab therapy 20 adult pediatric patient either steroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor resistant FSGS significant intolerance contraindication use agent . In addition clinical criterion , elevate level suPAR define inclusion . Changes baseline level potential biomarkers ( suPAR , well activation beta-3 integrin ) response treatment compare clinical measure efficacy . Participants screening/baseline visit confirm eligibility within 6 week prior first two Rituximab infusion ( Day 1 Day 15 ) . Participants attend follow visit 1 , 3 , 6 12 month Rituximab treatment assess adverse event collect safety blood urine sample .</detailed_description>

The rationale patient advance renal failure may progress rapidly towards ESRD . Collapsing variant FSGS , rare associate aggressive course Concurrent use immunosuppressive therapy exception prednisone 10 mg/day . Patients take immunosuppressive therapy , must immunosuppressive medication equal &gt; 3 month prior enrollment study exception patient demonstrate significant worsen proteinuria ( &gt; 30 % baseline ) washout period . These resistant patient treat 1 month washout due high likelihood progression and/or lack delay ( previous ) immunosuppression effect . Patients medical condition may cause FSGS ( e.g . HIV , lymphoma , heroin use ) secondary form FSGS due hyperfiltration injury ( massive obesity , vesicoureteral reflux , renal mass reduction ) Type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus diabetic glomerulosclerosis may contribute proteinuria patient History serious recurrent chronic infection Presence suspicion active infection include TB , HIV , Hepatitis B HCV positive test Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , Hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb ) , Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C serology , HIV serology positive TB skin test , require investigation rule active disease ( ie . chest xray ) Known active infection require hospitalization treatment intravenous antibiotic within 4 week oral antibiotic within 2 week study initiation Low immunoglobulin ( level base age ) Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x103/mL Patients receipt live vaccine within 4 week study initiation Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy within last five year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix Previous Treatment Bcell deplete antibody History severe allergic reaction humanize murine monoclonal antibody Treatment investigational agent within 4 week study initiation History major psychiatric disorder , drug alcohol abuse within previous 6 month Any disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination find clinical laboratory provide reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug may affect interpretation result render patient high risk treatment complication</criteria>
