	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Smac Mimetic TL32711 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose TL32711 ( smac mimetic TL32711 ) combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity safety profile TL32711 combination gemcitabine patient advance solid tumor . II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile TL32711 gemcitabine administer combination . III . To determine preliminary efficacy study combination patient advance solid tumor . IV . To determine relationship predictive biomarkers clinical activity use archival tumor tissue sample biomarker analysis . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study smac mimetic TL32711 . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute smac mimetic TL32711 IV 30 minute weekly 2 week . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
