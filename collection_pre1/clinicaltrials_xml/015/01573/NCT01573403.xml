	<brief_summary>This 3-arm , double-blind , randomize , control , parallel dose range clinical study 3 day therapy investigate effect DLBS2411 gastric pH regulation well safety healthy volunteer . DLBS2411 similar mechanism action proton-pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) . However , hypothetically potential PPIs suppress gastric acid previous preclinical study DLBS2411 proven effect activity H+/K+ ATPase , enzyme regulate proton pump stomach , also gene expression . It hypothesize DLBS2411 may benefit gastric pH regulation healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
