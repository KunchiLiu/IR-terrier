	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease involve many motor difficulty well non-motor one . Recent research strongly suggest exercise important Parkinson 's disease . We interested especially dance form exercise , combine physical movement balance task , social engagement , mental stimulation . Therefore , think dance class may beneficial exercise Parkinson 's disease ; purpose study see Argentinean Tango class might improve motor non-motor manifestation Parkinson 's disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tango Treatment Motor Non-motor Manifestations Parkinson 's Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There accumulate evidence positive effect exercise gait speed , strength , balance , quality life people PD . Habitual physical activity lower risk develop PD . In toxin-induced animal model PD , exercise may decrease neuronal injury . The key component exercise program PD include : 1 ) cueing strategy improve gait ; 2 ) cognitive movement strategy improve transfer ; 3 ) exercise improve balance , 4 ) training joint mobility muscle power physical capacity . Traditional exercise program meet need often appeal old adult include patient PD . Unfortunately half individual PD meet recommend daily level physical activity . There connection music level Dopamine , pivotal establish maintain behavior . According recent study music-induced emotional state increase dopamine release , partially explain musical experience value music especially potent pleasurable stimulus people , frequently use affect emotional state . The development intervention combine exercise , accessibility , enjoyability , good motivation practice regularly improve mood stimulating cognition would ideal individual PD . Dance may provide characteristic , may affective useful accessible intervention improve motor impairment . Dance require dynamic balance permanent adjustment environment time . It promote enjoyment encouragement interest continue participation . Habitual social dancer superior balance , gait function , reaction time compare age-matched nondancers . Regular dance improves balance functional mobility , increase motivation continue healthful exercise-related behaviour old adult . There also evidence exercise positive impact cognitive function vulnerable population . Musical exercise improve cognitive function resident long- term care facilitation without diagnosis dementia patient establish Alzheimer 's disease . Particularly dance produce clinically important change measure mental status behaviour patient moderate severe dementia . Social isolation important cause development depression old population may cause number factor , include mobility limitation : medical illness , economic difficulty . The relationship social isolation depression clear , link social engagement improve mood perceive quality life . There also important link social disengagement , depression cognitive decline elderly population . Dance class occur group set force social interaction , may produce noticeable improvement mood subsequently decrease cognitive decline . There currently insufficient body literature dance PD much additional work need . Most study dance PD use small sample size assess short-term effect long-term effect dance intervention focus motor manifestation PD . Consequently , effect dance cognition , mood motivation yet explore PD . There insufficient literature type dance beneficial motor non-motor manifestation PD . Why Argentinean tango ? Better improvement balance complex gait observe elderly participant tango lesson compare walk group . Beneficial effect Argentine tango also suggest , compare traditional exercise improve balance functional mobility patient PD . Furthermore , positron emission tomography ( PET ) study show increased activity basal ganglion tango movement perform meter predictable beat . Tango require particular motor skill , include frequent initiation cessation , variety movement speed , rhythmic variation , spontaneous multidirectional perturbation . These feature target motor impairment movement initiation , turn , bradykinesia . Interesting , tango could also effectively address freeze gait ( FOG ) , step pattern mimic rehabilitation exercise design FOG . Visual cue , foot step , improve FOG . Tango technique involve step partner 's foot , tap partner 's foot , cross one foot another , step similar conventional rehabilitation FOG . In addition , tango involve rhythmic rocking , alternate shift center mass foot foot , another good strategy freeze . Tango appear large effect freezing compare style dance ( waltz/foxtrot ) . Tango involve practice control movement speed size , may improve walk velocity stride length . It also add slow quick step vary lengths require continual adjustment feature . Tango may especially beneficial address backward walking , critical area give tendency fall backward direction PD6 . Surprisingly recent study , tango even significantly improve upper extremity function , may reflective global impact exercise bradykinesia . Better improvement balance complex gait observe elderly participant tango lesson compare walk group . No study examine effect tango cognitive function , mood motivation patient PD .</detailed_description>
