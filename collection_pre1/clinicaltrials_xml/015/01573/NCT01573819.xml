	<brief_summary>The study drug , GSK356278 , possible new medicine treatment Huntington 's disease . Huntington 's disease , often call HD , cause faulty gene pass family . HD cause damage nerve cell brain cause waste away . As damage progress patient develop symptom affect every aspect life . HD reduce people 's ability walk , talk , think , communicate cause uncontrolled movement . GSK356278 may slow progression damage nerve cell people HD help ability think . GSK356278 well tolerate give single dose healthy people . In study want see effect , good bad , GSK356278 people take every day . During study look 3 different dos GSK356278 36 healthy people . The study also look GSK356278 tablet behave body swallow ( call pharmacokinetics ) . The study also look effect GSK356278 body ( call pharmacodynamics ) . The study help design future clinical study GSK356278 .</brief_summary>
