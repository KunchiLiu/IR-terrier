	<brief_title>Optimization Peripheral Nerve Reconstruction : A Non-inferiority Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients plan undergo peripheral nerve repair traumatic nerve injury either gap ( group 1 ) critical size defect ( &gt; 5mm , group 2 ) finger provide write informed consent investigation randomise two group : . Group 1 : nerve repair gap Group 1a ( standard ) : Epineural Suture Group 1b ( experimental ) : Epineural Suture Fibrin Wrap Group 2 : Nerve repair critical size ( &gt; 5mm ) defect Group 2a ( standard ) : Epineural suture autologous nerve transplantation lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN ) Group 2b ( experimental ) : Epineural suture Fibrin Conduit In group epineural suture perform ( suture enhancement ) . The outcome fibrin enwrapment fibrin conduit compare standard treatment option date ( direct nerve repair autologous nerve graft , respectively ) . Randomization perform use computer-base algorithm ( www.randomizer.at ) . Ambulatory follow patient carry Department Plastic , Reconstructive Aesthetic Surgery , Handsurgery , University Hospital Basel . The outcome-assessor well patient blind analysis outcome-assessor access surgery report . The investigator 's aim analyse 48 patient within 12 month . Since 100 patient undergo peripheral nerve repair annually Department Plastic , Reconstructive Aesthetic Surgery , Handsurgery University Hospital Basel , patient accrual appear unproblematic . After completion , statistical analysis focus comparison different type surgery concern clinical parameter 2-Point Discrimination ( PD ) , Semmes Weinstein test , electroneurography conduct . After six month , difference expect group 1a 1b 2a 2b , respectively . In investigator 's experience confounders may influence nerve regeneration . A similar patient satisfaction expect group . The investigator expect high patient satisfaction group 2b group 2a due nerve tissue harvest . Between group 1a 1b difference expect regard MHQ .</detailed_description>
