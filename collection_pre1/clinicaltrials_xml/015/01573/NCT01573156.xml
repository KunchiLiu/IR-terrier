	<brief_summary>Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy ( VTP ) Vascular Occluding Agent ( VOA ) WST11 , may offer alternative , provide tumour destruction via minimally invasive approach . In investigation , investigator plan use WST11 VTP procedure treat predetermine small renal tumour target . Patients give general anaesthetic , ensure immobility , prevent discomfort treatment session . Treated patient undergo surgical resection tumour , accuracy reliability tissue death VTP assess histologically . The aim proof concept study demonstrate whether modality potential clinical role treatment oncological kidney disease , either alternative surgery , surgery feasible .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male postmenopausal female , age 60 year . Lesions suspicious renal cell carcinoma triple phase CT &lt; 4cm maximum diameter suitable surgical resection Participant must sufficiently good health suitable general anaesthesia VTP treatment subsequent surgical resection tumour Subjects must ≥ 1 evaluable tumour visualize diagnostic ultrasound . If one tumour exists , index tumour nominate treated ( uncommon ) Previous chemotherapy / biological therapy cancer permit , subject recover fully effect prior surgery ( minimum 28 day ) . Patients receive radiotherapy target area within precede 12 month . Subject clinically acceptable haematological , electrolyte hepatic function demonstrate serum laboratory value within 14 day prior VTP treatment : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000mm3 Haemoglobin ≥ 10gdl1 Prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤ 1.5 * Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Activated partial thromboplastin time ( APPT ) ≤ 1.5 * ULN Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 * ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 3 * ULN Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) &lt; 2 * ULN ; unless arise bone Participants clinically acceptable ECG Able ( Investigators opinion ) willing comply study requirement . Willing allow General Practitioner consultant , appropriate , notified participation study . The participant may enter study ANY follow apply : Non menopausal woman Significant hepatic impairment . Significant renal impairment mean surgical resection unsuitable Clinical radiological evidence metastatic disease Subjects tumours lie adjacent vital structure VTP treatment would risk damage structure Subjects currently take immunosuppressive medication Patients whose medical condition need follow medication potential photosensitizing effect ( tetracycline , sulphonamides , phenothiazine , sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agent , thiazide diuretic , griseofulvin amiodarone ( see appendix G ) ) treatment stop replaced treatment without photosensitize property Patients absolute need anticoagulant drug antiplatelet drug ( e.g. , warfarin , aspirin ) , withdrawn 10 day prior VTP procedure . Scheduled elective surgery procedure require general anaesthesia study . Any significant disease disorder , opinion Investigator , may either put participant risk participation study , may influence result study , participant 's ability participate study . Participants involve treatment phase clinical trial ( observational followup study allow ) An American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) score ≥ 3 A World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status ≥2</criteria>
