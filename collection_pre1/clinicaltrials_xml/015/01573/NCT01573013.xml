	<detailed_description>Introduction Coexisting chronic lead poison iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) common urban area develop region , particularly young child . In urban Morocco , anemia affect 1/3rd schoolchildren lead exposure high . Lead poison IDA impair cognitive development educability may therefore substantial health , social economic cost develop country . Iron status alters susceptibility gastrointestinal lead exposure ; absorption lead sharply increased child IDA . IDA upregulates divalent metal transporter trans-port protein ( DMT-1 ) increase lead absorption . Thus , iron fortification reduce IDA may also reduce lead absorption effective strategy accompany environmental lead abatement . The optimal iron compound wheat flour currently debate , although elemental iron compound commonly use , may poorly absorb face inhibitory compound found wheat flour . A form chelate iron , NaFeEDTA , promise iron fortificant recommend wheat flour fortification . It also lead chelator . It may superior iron fortificants ability reduce body lead burden , due : 1. iron highly bioavailable face dietary inhibitor ( phytic acid wheat flour ) ; 2. potentially , ability chelate lead gut bloodstream . Thus , may good choice fortification wheat flour Morocco , particularly urban area , reduce IDA low body lead . Study aim objective : 1 . Assessment body lead burden iron status cohort individual reside area presume high lead exposure . Investigation association lead burden iron status . 2 . Comparison effect iron fortification without NaEDTA body lead iron status lead-exposed child ; relative impact cognition . Study hypotheses : The prevalence iron deficiency elevate blood lead high child region . 2 ) Body lead burden , assess blood lead level urinary lead delta-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) , high individual poorer iron status . 3 ) Poor iron status associate low intake bioavailable iron . 4 ) Greater severity iron deficiency and/or high body lead child predict poor performance cognitive motor test , condition interact predict poor performance . Study design : Our study carry one four sub-economic area , previously use baseline assessment near Marrakesh , Morocco ( exact site still need determined accord extend lead contamination level human population ) . Body lead burden iron status determine , association examine use cross-sectional design . For purpose , blood urine sample collect two group ( preschool school-aged child ) , reside area high lead exposure . Study design : An 8-month intervention study iron deficient , lead-exposed school child ( n=500 ) design investigate whether iron fortification reduce IDA may also reduce lead absorption effective strategy accompany environmental lead abatement . For purpose child divide four group receive daily fortify baked snack contain either : 1 ) 66.4 mg NaFeEDTA ; 2 ) 52.2 mg Na2EDTA dehydrate ; 3 ) 27.1 mg FeSO4 ; 4 ) fortificants .</detailed_description>
