	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study effect safety give lithium carbonate ( lithium ) patient small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) undergo radiation therapy brain ( PCI ; prophylactic cranial irradiation ) . PCI use prevent cancer metastases return brain . This treatment cause short-term memory problem damage hippocampus . Lithium may help prevent lessen memory problem cause PCI protect hippocampus .</brief_summary>
