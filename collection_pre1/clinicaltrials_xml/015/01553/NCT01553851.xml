	<brief_title>GSK1120212 Surgically Resectable Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale study oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma rest pre-clinical finding demonstrate ( ) activation ERK1/2 kinases associate aggressive feature , ( b ) aggressive phenotype directly link expression CD44 , cell surface hyaluronan receptor ( c ) association activate ERK1/2 CD44 also identify human cell line primary tumor . These data suggest ERK1/2 targetable biochemical pathway CD44 express cell . These cell represent putative cancer stem cell tumor initiate cell associated bad patient outcome . Thus , application GSK1120212 target OCSCC specific translational application laboratory finding .</detailed_description>
