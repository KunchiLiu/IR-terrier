A total 80 patient forearm/elbow fracture plan include study . Patients randomly attain Training Control group . Training period six week . Patients control group receive standard care provide fracture , include fixation rest.Before start study six week , bilateral bone density distal radius measure DXA . Before trial , grip strength rest muscle electrical activity contralateral wrist flexor extensor measure . After six week , bilateral grip strength rest muscle electrical activity measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Unilateral Forearm Vibration On The Loss Of Muscle And Bone Of Contralateral Forearm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The structure bone muscle surround change temporally synchronized fashion . Skeletal muscle positive effect bone structure function . It well-known exercise training muscle improve resistance bone mechanical load physical activity also important treat prevent osteoporosis . Resistance impact training induce bone formation and/or prevent bone resorption . Immobilization frequently lead disuse osteoporosis patient bone fracture . Vibration strong osteogenic effect . The cyclic mechanical load bone stimulate osteocyte . Vibration-induced bone formation neuronally regulate . Vibration also effectively enhance muscle strength power . Previous study show vibration increase muscle electromyographic ( EMG ) activity . Based bone myoregulation reflex , bone sensitive mechanical stimulus send mechanical input signal central nervous system neuronally regulate muscle activity . Previous study document impact unilateral training limb muscle untrained contralateral homologous muscle . The aim present study investigate effect vibrate forearm bone free limb muscle strength bone mineral density forearm patient forearm/elbow fracture . The study include total 80 patient forearm/elbow fracture . The participant meeting inclusion criterion randomize one two group : training group ( 40 case ) control group ( 40 case ) . Patients control group receive standard care provide fracture , include fixation rest . Forearm Vibration : Training group exercise 5 time week six week period use forearm vibration device . The forearm vibration device consist joystick unit , weight-pulley system control panel . The subject seat chair . The right forearm place vibration device shoulder 10 degree abduction , elbow 90 degree flexion forearm wrist neutral position . The axis rotation joystick unit align wrist joint free arm . The joystick unit capable perform angular slide motion simultaneously . The angular motion obtain vibration effect slide motion obtain compression effect . The angular motion joystick unit provide electric motor . The range angular motion 6 degree . The weight attach joystick rope pulley system provide mechanical loading forearm ( compression effect ) . This weight define vibration load . Maximum vibration load tolerate applied vibration . The amplitude vibration ( range motion wrist ) 6 degree frequency vibration 40 Hz . The exercise duration intensity low beginning increase systematically 6-week training period . The subject ask report negative side effect adverse reaction train diary . Bone Densitometry : Before trail six week , bilateral bone density distal radius measure DXA . The bilateral bone density evaluate bone densitometer ( Norland ) . Grip Strength Measurement : Before start study , grip strength wrist muscle free limb measure . After six week , bilateral grip strength measure hand dynamometer ( Jamar digital plus hand dynamometer ) . Surface EMG : Surface EMG right leave wrist muscle record use disposable self-adhesive bipolar Ag/AgCl electrode ( Kendall Arbo ) place belly . The small disc electrode ( 10-mm diameter , inter-electrode distance 20 mm ) arrange direction muscle fiber . All cable carefully tap skin . The skin overlie muscle shave , light abrasion apply , skin clean use 70 % alcohol , conductive paste use reduce electrode resistance place electrode . Motor unit potential amplify record computer off-line analysis sample frequency 2k use data acquisition analysis system ( Powerlab data acquisition system , ADInstruments , Australia ) . Twenty second myoelectrical activity record wrist muscle rest . The mean myoelectrical activity calculate root mean square ( RMS ) use EMG device software , define `` rest myoelectrical activity '' . The rest myoelectrical activity express microvolt . Power spectral analysis do . They conduct use Hamming windowed , 2048 point epoch , result frequency resolution 0.98 Hz . This prospective , randomize , control , single blind trial</detailed_description>
