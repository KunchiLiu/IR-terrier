	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study study doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA yet approve drug patient type cancer use outside research study . Chemotherapy radiation standard treatment patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . For people epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation , add type drug call tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) help increase response treatment . Afatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor . It study previous research study participant advance NSCLC . Results study indicate may helpful treat NSCLC EGFR mutation . In study , patient stage III NSCLC EGFR mutation receive standard treatment radiation chemotherapy . If possible , patient tumor remove surgery . Afatinib give radiation chemotherapy surgery . The aim give afatinib radiation therapy try shrink tumor . This may make radiation therapy effective since radiation therapy tend work well small tumor . The goal study see add afatinib standard treatment help improve response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib With CT RT EGFR-Mutant NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study treatment divide 5 stage : Stage 1-induction , consist afatinib two 4-week cycle . Afatinib pill patient take mouth per day . The patient receive study drug diary record dose afatinib . Stage 2-concurrent radiation chemotherapy cisplatin/pemetrexed two 3-week cycle . Stage 3-Surgery remove tumor participant whose tumor remove surgery . This do 4-6 week finish radiation chemotherapy . The exact timing depend upon quickly patient recovers side effect radiation chemotherapy . The investigator use piece patient tumor remove surgery research test look biomarkers gene protein may associate response afatinib , chemotherapy radiation . Stage 4-Chemotherapy surgery ( adjuvant chemotherapy ) . The patient doctor decide patient receive chemotherapy patient surgery receive consolidation afatinib . If patient receive , start 6-12 week surgery finish radiation patient surgery . The chemotherapy receive along radiation therapy . Stage 5-Consolidation afatinib twenty-six 4-week cycle ( 2 year ) participant respond 2 cycle induction afatinib . The investigator would like keep track patient medical condition status patient disease 5 year patient stop study treatment . Keeping touch patient check patient condition every year help investigator look long-term effect research study . The patient ask CT scan follow : - Every 3 month first year stop study treatment - Every 6 month year 2-4 stopping study treatment - Once per year year 5 stopping study treatment</detailed_description>
