	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect adalimumab ( Humira ) , compare NB-UVB ( narrow-band ultraviolet B ) phototherapy placebo ( inactive substance may resemble active substance medical value ) injection . The study compare effect systemic inflammation cardiovascular disease risk factor subject diagnose moderate severe psoriasis . This study look systemic vascular inflammation subject test call FDG-PET/CT ( Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) . The study also look cardio metabolic ( heart disease metabolic factor diabetes ) identifier blood . A blood sample take look marker identify high cholesterol , cholesterol efflux function ( ability cholesterol move body ) , metabolic factor , inflammation . This study also assess effect adalimumab ( Humira ) , compare NB-UVB phototherapy placebo injection psoriasis activity severity . The study also compare safety adalimumab ( Humira ) NB-UVB phototherapy placebo injection . This study also evaluate subject ' report outcome questionnaire assess quality-of-life subject live psoriasis .</brief_summary>
