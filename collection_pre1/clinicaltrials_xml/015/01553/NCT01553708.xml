	<brief_summary>Partial thickness burn wound likely heal within 2-3 week mainly mechanism epithelialization . However , depend depth wound patient condition . Infection one common complication cause delay wound heal might affect quality patient 's life . Generally , standard treatment partial thickness burn wind topical 1 % silver sulfadiazine cream . Previous study report broad spectrum antimicrobial activity silver sulfadiazine cream demonstrate accelerate effect wound heal . Therefore , combination substance promote wound heal topical silver sulfadiazine cream might benefit partial thickness burn wound treatment . The objective study compare result partial thickness burn wound treatment burn unit , Siriraj hospital topical cream contain 1 % silver sulfadiazine plus 6 % epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) 1 % silver zinc sulfadiazine . The demographic data ( age , sex , % body surface area burn ) , time wound closure , pain itching , dose type pain itch medication , adverse effect topical medication , laboratory result cost expense . This prospective , double blind , randomize-controlled study . The sample size partial thickness burn wound patient treated burn unit , Siriraj hospital . Patients allocate 2 group receive treatment either topical silver sulfadiazine plus EGF silver zinc sulfadiazine . All parameter data analyze repeated measure ANOVA independent t-test .</brief_summary>
