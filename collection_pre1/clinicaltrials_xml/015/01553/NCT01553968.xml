	<brief_summary>It suggest imbalance TCA-cycle flux β-oxidation may underlie insulin resistance , predispose factor development type 2 diabetes mellitus . Acetylcarnitine concentration suggest marker imbalance . It expect TCA-cycle capacity high ( high oxidative capacity ) , less acetylcarnitine accumulate , improve balance supply demand lipid . The major research objective examine acute exercise result pronounce increase acetylcarnitine concentration sedentary subject compare endurance-trained subject exercise-induced increase acetylcarnitine restore quickly endurance-trained subject compare sedentary subject . The investigator hypothesize increase acetylcarnitine level lower train subject compare sedentary subject , due good balance lipid supply utilization TCA-cycle . Furthermore expect acetylcarnitine concentration restore faster trained subject , tight regulation influx fatty acid . To test hypothesis investigator want compare acetylcarnitine response exercise group sedentary subject group endurance train subject . This response measure 30 minute exercise use 1H-MRS .</brief_summary>
