	<detailed_description>The propose research first evaluation implementation Mobile Diabetes Education Teams ( MDETs ) Canada . This intervention support primary care provider ( PCPs ) offering diabetes education team ( one register nurse [ RN ] one register dietitian [ RD ] ) one four time month , base patient volume , various primary care site assist share care management patient diabetes . This intervention collaboration Mississauga Halton Local Health Integration Network ( MH LHIN ) host Trillium Diabetes Management Centre Halton Diabetes Program . Each host site receive permanent operational funding half diabetes education team ( salary support ) Ontario Ministry Health Long-term Care ( MHLTC ) new Ontario Diabetes Strategy . The rationale incorporate MDETs primary care guide extensive literature underuse low referral diabetes education program ( DEPs ) , diabetes self-management education primarily offer . Low utilization due low PCP referral rate service , well numerous systematic operational barrier PCPs patient . Consequently , majority Canadians receive diabetes care solely PCPs , express barrier care diabetes patient provide sub-optimal care consistently adhere clinical practice guideline . As result , MHLTC invest million dollar expand align current program increase access team-based care . The objective research evaluate structural redesign investigator deliver diabetes care self-management education use collaborative approach PCPs DEPs guide Chronic Care Model conceptual framework . The purpose research twofold : 1 ) evaluate effect MDET intervention : ( ) patient clinical outcome ; ( ii ) quality care patient receive PCPs ; ( iii ) PCPs ' referral patient ' utilization DEPs ; 2 ) ass implementation process MDET intervention degree collaboration team function PCPs MDET member across primary care site . A mixed-methods approach propose three year period . Patients refer MDET PCPs . The MDET meet patient two hour ( one hour RN one hour RD ) assess level diabetes knowledge , diabetes self-care lifestyle habit ; data use develop patient treatment priority action care plan . Three 30 minute follow-up visit MDET carry one-year period patient patient action plan review , discuss potentially revise . A communication tool develop good facilitate communication patient information PCPs MDETs . Case conferences conduct major change make patient 's treatment plan patient 's visit . Accordingly , PCPs educators collaboratively manage patient care . A cluster-randomized trial step wedge design use ensure site eventually receive intervention , still facilitate comparison change within individual study group across time point attribute intervention . The inclusion criterion review patient medical record patient 18 year age , type 2 diabetes , HbA1c great 8 % . Twenty unique patient chart extraction perform 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month 12 primary care site collect patient care process patient clinical outcome data ( total 1,200 patient chart ) . Characteristics interprofessional collaboration PCPs MDET assess practice site end one year . To assess implementation MDET across site , qualitative process data , in-depth interview patient , PCPs MDETs , MDETs ' field note debrief session analyze . MDETs strengthen formalize link primary care provider diabetes education program within community , increase patient access diabetes self-management education support , potentially improve patient experience clinical outcome enhance coordination integration care . This study timely relevant DEPs local PCPs start integrate service across Canada ; thus , research provide evidence necessary inform practice model . If result promise , model extend direct impaired glucose tolerance gestational diabetes/post-gestational diabetes ; result , diabetes prevention , management care deliver , greatly reduce burden diabetes Canada .</detailed_description>
