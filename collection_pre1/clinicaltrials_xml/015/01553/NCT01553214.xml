	<brief_summary>Background : - White blood cell call granulocyte help body fight infection . People chemotherapy bone marrow transplant may low number cell . Transfusions cell help improve body 's ability fight infection . However , cell locate bone marrow spleen , hard collect healthy donor . Two drug , filgrastim dexamethasone , help move cell bloodstream collect apheresis . Researchers want study best way collect white blood cell . They also want monitor effect injection donation volunteer donor . Objectives : - To improve amount quality granulocyte ( white blood cell ) collect apheresis donation . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 75 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Initial blood test do check eligibility . - Participants donate granulocyte apheresis maximum 12 time 1 year . Donations usually request often every 4 week . Donors allow decline participation time . - Participants one injection filgrastim 12 24 hour donation . They also two tablet dexamethasone 12 hour donation . - White blood cell collect apheresis . The apheresis last 2 hour . - Participants eligible donate reach 76th birthday .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bacterial fungal infection neutropenic patient patient inherited disorder neutrophil function continue cause substantial morbidity mortality . In particular , fungal infection increasingly important cause death patient receive aggressive chemotherapy , patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , patient chronic granulomatous disease , patient bone marrow failure syndrome severe aplastic anemia . The strong predictor progression death invasive mold infection cancer/ HSCT set duration neutropenia . Any modality increase granulocyte count period profound neutropenia severe infection thus likely clinical benefit . In 1970-80 , collection granulocyte concentrate apheresis healthy donor stimulate corticosteroid alone yield product insufficient number granulocyte substantially raise circulate count neutropenic patient . Transfusion component variably associate clinical benefit . More recently , ability give donor recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) combination corticosteroid ( dexamethasone ) dramatically increase circulate neutrophil count prior apheresis result collection granulocyte concentrate contain 2 6 time many cell collect use steroid alone . Transfusion granulocyte concentrate collect G-CSF dexamethasone stimulation donor typically increase recipient granulocyte count 1,000 cells/uL , increase count generally sustain 24 48 hour . Transfusion daily every day granulocytes derive apheresis G-CSF dexamethasone-stimulated donor associate observational retrospective study clearance life-threatening infection neutropenic patient , single small randomize prospective study demonstrate improve survival neutropenic infected patient receive granulocyte . Granulocyte component recognize licensed blood component Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , neither G-CSF dexamethasone approve FDA use allogeneic granulocytapheresis donor . Studies NIH Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) define optimal timing dose drug granulocyte donor , component use clinical care since 1996 . Short term adverse effect G-CSF dexamethasone , include bone pain , myalgia , headache , insomnia fatigue , well know possible long term effect , include cataract serial steroid administration , describe . The purpose current protocol determine operational feasibility manage volunteer community donor granulocytapheresis program provide inform consent administration filgrastim dexamethasone volunteer donor donate granulocyte apheresis . Donor accrual retention , immediate short term adverse effect G-CSF dexamethasone , long term effect , assess healthy subject permit donate granulocyte maximum 12 time per year . Participants select base general blood donor eligibility criterion , adequacy antecubital venous access , interest program . Most subject already experience plateletpheresis donor . The toxicity granulocyte transfusion survival discharge rate transfusion recipient monitor , protocol design evaluate efficacy granulocyte transfusion .</detailed_description>
