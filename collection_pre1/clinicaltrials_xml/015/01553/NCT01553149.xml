	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well low-dose lenalidomide work compare high-dose lenalidomide treat young patient juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas optic nerve pathway gliomas come back ( recurrent ) , respond treatment ( refractory ) , grow , spread , get bad ( progressive ) . Lenalidomide may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether low-dose lenalidomide less effective high-dose lenalidomide treat patient juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas optic nerve pathway glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose High-Dose Lenalidomide Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent , Refractory , Progressive Pilocytic Astrocytoma Optic Pathway Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate child recurrent , refractory , progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas optic pathway glioma treat Regimen A low-dose ( 20 mg/m^2/dose ) Regimen B high-dose ( 115 mg/m^2/dose ) lenalidomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate event-free survival ( EFS ) ( base standard two-dimensional tumor measurement , determined institution ) child recurrent , refractory , progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas optic pathway glioma treat lenalidomide . II . To compare response category EFS across 3 magnetic resonance ( MR ) sequence ( T2-weighted , fluid attenuate inversion recovery [ FLAIR ] , T1-weighted post-contrast ) . III . To correlate steady-state pharmacokinetics lenalidomide ( 1 sample obtain day 5-21 ) objective response EFS . IV . To evaluate toxicity long-term lenalidomide use . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( Regimen A ) : Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( Regimen B ) : Patients receive high-dose lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually approximately 3 year .</detailed_description>
