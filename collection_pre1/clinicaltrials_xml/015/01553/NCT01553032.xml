	<detailed_description>With aim optimize combined treatment strategy term efficacy well manageable side effect , implementation Cetuximab EGFR target antibody demonstrate successfully significant increase survival time , although exhibit expected increase skin toxicity ( 1,2 ) . This Phase IV trial explore prominent side effect , due synergistic effect radiodermatitis acneiform rash , great detail . In addition , feasibility aspect complex treatment schedule common routine patient present increased comorbidity rate compare study population study pivotal Phase III trial observe . Further , peripheral blood sample patient consent participate molecular monitoring collect genetic , epigenetic- transcriptional profile correlate clinical outcome parameter . The goal translational program identify confirm novel peripheral blood base molecular predictor surrogates therapy response . Tissue sample available medical evidence patient consent participate assessment HPV status collect . The goal program correlate HPV status clinical outcome parameter . In addition , patient answer Quality Life questionnaires include EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire , Head Neck cancer specific module ( 3 ) Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) . This prospective , open , multicenter phase IV study design assess rate radiodermatitis patient LASCCHN treat combination radiotherapy EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody Cetuximab .</detailed_description>
