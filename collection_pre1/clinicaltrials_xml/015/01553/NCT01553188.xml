	<brief_summary>Background : - Advanced prostate cancer treat surgery drug low level androgen ( male hormone ) body . However , cancer become resistant treatment . These type cancer know castration-resistant prostate cancer . - Interfering growth blood vessel fee tumor slow prostate cancer growth . AMG 386 , new anticancer drug , target blood vessel fee tumor . It test different type cancer , prostate cancer . Researchers want see AMG 386 slow disease progression men castration-resistant prostate cancer . AMG 386 give abiraterone prednisone , two drug also use treat advanced prostate cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness AMG 386 abiraterone castration-resistant prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age castration-resistant prostate cancer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , image study . Blood urine sample also collect . - Participants separate two group . - The first group AMG 386 per week total four dos 28-day cycle . They also take abiraterone day prednisone twice day , every day cycle . - The second group AMG 386 . They take abiraterone day prednisone twice day , every day 28-day cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants continue take study drug long disease progress severe side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 386 Abiraterone Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Inhibition angiogenesis , either stand-alone approach combination chemotherapy , demonstrable antitumor efficacy castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) several antiangiogenic agent clinical trial population patient . - AMG 386 novel peptide-Fc fusion protein . The molecule non-glycosylated homodimer engineer fuse IgG1 Fc domain 4 copy anti-angiopoietin 2 ( Ang2 ) peptide . AMG 386 sequesters Ang1 Ang2 , thereby prevent interaction Tie2 inhibit tumor endothelial cell ( EC ) proliferation tumor growth . - Abiraterone acetate small molecule irreversibly inhibit CYP17 , rate-limiting enzyme androgen biosynthesis , block residual androgen synthesis adrenal gland tumor cell . - Previous study demonstrate vivo alteration testosterone level regulate expression VEGF , FGF , angiopoietin family member . Dual target androgen angiogenic axis represent novel approach potential target therapy patient metastatic CRPC . Objectives : -To estimate treatment effect measure progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat AMG 386 plus abiraterone/prednisone relative abiraterone/prednisone alone . Eligibility : -Patients progressive , metastatic CRPC radiographic evidence progression primary therapy ( surgery radiotherapy ) adequate androgen deprivation therapy . Design : - This open-label , randomize , phase II multicenter trial two-part design plan accrual 88 patient . - An initial run-in phase AMG 386 conduct 15mg/kg weekly escalate 30mg/kg weekly establish MTD . The decision declaration safe tolerable dose run-in phase lead second part study consist randomize comparison abiraterone/prednisone plus AMG 386 ( establish MTD ) vs. abiraterone/prednisone alone . - AMG 386 administer intravenously every week , day 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle . Abiraterone acetate self-administered daily mouth prednisone self-administered mouth either twice per day 5 mg per dose per day 10 mg per dose patient prefers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must metastatic , progressive , castrateresistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) radiographic evidence disease continue progress radiographically biochemically ( rise PSA level successive measurement ) despite adequate androgendeprivation therapy . If patient flutamide , disease progression document 4 week withdrawal . For patient bicalutamide nilutamide disease progression document 6 week withdrawal . Flutamide , nilutamide bicalutamide disease progression requirement apply patient drug least prior 6 month . Histopathological confirmation prostate cancer Laboratory Pathology NCI Walter Reed National Military Medical Center prior enter study . Patients enrol participate site may histopathological confirmation enrol centerprior enter study . Patients whose pathology specimens longer available may enrol patient clinical course consistent prostate cancer available documentation outside pathology laboratory diagnosis . All effort make material forward research team use correlative study case original tissue block archival biopsy material available . Patients must metastatic disease , define least one lesion bone scan least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Patients participate study must mCRPC . Patients receive docetaxel plus ADT metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer eligible study . ( Patients may enroll long progressive disease docetaxel 6 month remove treatment , treatment related toxicity resolve least grade 1 . ) Patients may 7 day treatment ketoconazole mouth past 6 month . Males great eqaul 18 year age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AMG 386 combination abiraterone patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 runin phase ; ECOG le equal 1 randomized phase . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month run phase &gt; 6 month randomize phase .
