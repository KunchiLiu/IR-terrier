	<brief_summary>Background : - Cord blood transplant treat cancer diseases child adult . The U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require cord blood collect store certain safety standard . However , available cord blood unit collect FDA set standard . These unit may meet FDA standard , meet similar standard set follow National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) . Cord blood unit meet new FDA standard may use transplant part research study . Doctors want allow people need transplant receive cord blood meet NMDP standard may meet FDA standard . Objectives : - To allow select cord blood unit meet current FDA standard use transplant . Eligibility : - Individuals need cord blood unit transplant , best match cord blood unit FDA-licensed . Design : - Participants provide consent receive cord blood meet NMDP standard may meet FDA standard . - Participants remain study observation 1 year transplant , withdraw study personal medical reason .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The requirement licensure become part FDA final rule Human Cells , Tissues , Tissue-Based Products ( HCT/Ps ) ( March 29 , 2004 May 25 , 2005 ) effort prevent transmission communicable disease , minimize contamination preserve integrity function processing , outline safety effectiveness requirement cell unrelated donor HCT/Ps minimally manipulate , assure label clear accurate misleading monitor communicate industry via establishment registration . However , October 20 , 2011 , unit meet manufacturing requirement licensure distribute transplantation transplant occur IND research protocol . These unit current future inventory domestic international cord blood bank demonstrate meet licensing requirement . In addition licensure guidance , FDA publish guidance August 2011 entitle Investigational New Drug Applications ( INDs ) Minimally Manipulated , Unrelated Allogeneic Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood Intended Hematopoietic Reconstitution Specified Indications . This study access distribution protocol conduct National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood unit ( CBUs ) pediatric adult patient , site wish receive NMDP unrelated cord blood unit treatment research must participate locally IRB- approve protocol . Primary Objectives The primary objective study examine incidence neutrophil recovery great equal 500/mm ( 3 ) cord blood transplantation multi-institution set use CBUs Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) license . Secondary Objectives In patient receive non-licensed CBU - Assess incidence graft rejection - Assess incidence transmission infection - Assess incidence serious infusion reaction Determine 1 year survival cord blood transplantation - Assess cumulative incidence acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) grade II IV grade III IV - Assess cumulative incidence chronic GVHD - Determine CBU-derived engraftment Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria - Patients age FDA-specified indication - Signed informed consent ( assent applicable ) obtain prior study enrollment Exclusion Criteria - Patients license CBUs available - Cord blood transplant recipients international transplant center - Patients enrol another IND protocol access unlicensed CBU ( ) - Patients whose select unlicensed CBU ( ) minimally manipulate Design -Treatment description , include pre-transplant conditioning GVHD prophylaxis , occur per transplant center specification .</detailed_description>
