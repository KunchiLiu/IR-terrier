	<brief_summary>This single-centre prospective trial 140 patient employ [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission compute tomography ( FDG PET/CT ) advance motion correction image fusion algorithms create motion frozen display quantify FDG-uptake thus inflammatory activity atherosclerotic plaque coronary tree . Four group patient , two stable coronary artery disease two acute coronary syndrome compare result FDG PET/CT correlate result invasive coronary angiography , intravascular ultrasound / virtual histology , patient risk profile serum marker inflammation . The investigator hypothesize increase FDG accumulation atherosclerotic plaque show positive correlation inflammatory activity coronary plaque marker plaque vulnerability well risk profile patient serum marker inflammation . The investigator furthermore hypothesize FDG PET/CT able detect high risk patient provide important mean risk stratification optimization patient management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/CT Quantification Atherosclerotic Plaque Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently morphological reference standard detect vulnerable coronary plaque . However , inflammatory activity plaque composition predict future cardiovascular event . Thus aim objective study follow : 1 . Inflammatory activity coronary artery great peripheral artery shall detect quantified mean FDG PET/CT hybrid imaging . 2 . We aim develop `` motion frozen display '' heart coronary artery mean ECG- respiratory trigger myocardial motion reduce motion artifact . 3 . We aim compare coronary FDG uptake patient know stable CAD coronary FDG uptake patient acute coronary syndrome . 4 . We aim correlate coronary PET/CT intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) / virtual histology ( VH ) , carry coronary angiography provide gold standard characterize plaque composition . 5 . Correlation inflammatory activity measure PET risk profile patient , blood coagulability inflammatory plaque-associated serum marker establish valid risk stratification . 6 . Follow-up patient least one year detect cardiovascular event . Study Design This prospective single-center study evaluate coronary FDG PET/CT control standardized condition . The study approve local ethical committee well German Federal Authority Radiation Protection ( Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz ) . All examination perform University Hospital LMU Munich . The study accordance Declaration Helsinki , patient provide inform write consent . We plan image four study population high risk inflammatory atherosclerosis plaque rupture : two group consist patient stable coronary disease two group consist patient acute coronary syndrome ( Figure 1 ) . In follow , group describe detail . Patients acute coronary syndrome Group 1 : Patients acute cardiovascular event typical aberration ECG ( STEMI ) positive serum marker need stabilize immediately , thus eligible IVUS . However , mean ICA `` culprit lesion '' identify . 48 72 hour event stable patient receive FDG PET/CT detect morphology inflammation culprit lesion well vulnerable plaque might need intervention . PET/CT result correlate result ICA . Group 2 : Patients acute coronary syndrome without typical aberration ECG ( NSTEMI ) without positive serum marker need stabilize immediately . In second step ICA IVUS / VH perform . 48 72 hour event stable patient receive FDG PET/CT detect morphology inflammation culprit lesion well vulnerable plaque might need intervention . PET/CT result correlate result ICA IVUS / VH . Patients stable CAD Group 3 : Symptomatic patient stable CAD , eligible ICA receive additional FDG PET/CT scan well IVUS / VH . Results correlate . Group 4 : Patients eligible ICA 6 month STEMI revascularization receive IVUS / VH FDG PET/CT . Results correlate regard former culprit lesion well coronary lesion might present . Summary work hypothesis Hypothesis 1 ( technique ) By mean FDG PET/CT radiotracer uptake coronary artery allocate specific lesion quantify aid appropriate technique motion correction three-dimensional image fusion . Hypothesis 2 ( association FDG-uptake extent disease ) The coronary FDG-uptake patient stable CAD significantly low coronary FDG-uptake patient acute coronary syndrome . Hypothesis 3 ( correlation IVUS/VH FDG-uptake ) Plaques typical sign vulnerability IVUS/VH show significantly increase FDG-uptake surrogate marker inflammatory activity . Hypothesis 4 ( association FDG-uptake risk profile / serum marker ) Coronary FDG-uptake show positive correlation increase risk profile ( Framingham Score ) serum marker plaque vulnerability inflammatory reaction . Hypothesis 5 ( association FDG-uptake cardiovascular event ) Increased coronary FDG-uptake increase uptake peripheral vessel associate cardiovascular cerebrovascular event course one year .</detailed_description>
