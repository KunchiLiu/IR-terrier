	<brief_title>Examining Common Complaint Women Who Receive Chemotherapy Breast Cancer- Cognitive Difficulty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most woman breast cancer diagnose early stage disease ( Stage I II ) 90 % expect survive least 5 year . Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens breast cancer often associate complaint cognitive change , mostly inability concentrate memory lapse may persist woman long chemotherapy end . These change frequently accompany report triad behavioral condition : fatigue , increase stress , depressive symptom . Biologically , cytokine release pattern play important role regulation immune system normal CNS function , include neural cell repair metabolism neurotransmittersâ€”both critical normal cognitive functioning . Thus , theoretical underpinnings research embed biobehavioral ( mind-body ) model characterize multidimensional interaction among mind , neuroendocrine , immune system . The purpose prospective , longitudinal project 100 woman determine whether difference cognitive functioning related behavioral condition ( fatigue , perceive stress , depressive symptom ) woman 3 group : early stage BC treat surgery chemotherapy , woman early stage BC treat surgery without chemotherapy age-gender-education-matched healthy cohort without cancer . The primary aim project examine relationship among fatigue , perceive stress , depressive symptom neurocognitive impairment . A secondary aim explore relationship among key behavioral biological marker may explain underlying mechanism development neurocognitive impairment . In particular , project explore pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine pattern potential association neurocognitive functioning . For primary aim , mixed linear model use test difference group . For analysis secondary aim variable reduction stage correlation use . The strength project biobehavioral approach discern underlying mechanism neurocognitive impairment woman early stage BC receive adjuvant chemotherapy . In addition , three common behavioral condition associate BC and/or chemotherapy , fatigue , perceive stress , depressive symptom , evaluate potentially confound effect cognitive function .</detailed_description>
