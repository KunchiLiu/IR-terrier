	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc , scleroderma ) multisystem autoimmune rheumatic disease cause inﬂammation , vascular damage ﬁbrosis . Besides involvement skin , fibrosis also affect many internal organ involve blood vessel , lung , heart , kidney etc . Although advance understand pathophysiology use immunosuppressive therapy bring significant improvement outcome autoimmune disease , scleroderma still remain disease high mortality 10 yr survival rate improve 54 % 66 % last 25 years1 . But significant change pattern cause mortality year . The frequency death due renal crisis significantly decrease ( mainly due effectiveness ACE Inhibitors ) , 42 % 6 % scleroderma-related death ( p 0.001 ) , whereas proportion patient scleroderma died pulmonary fibrosis increase ( due lack significant treatment ) 6 % 33 % ( p 0.001 ) . The frequency pulmonary hypertension , independent PF , also significantly increased time period ( p &lt; 0.05 ) 1 . Presently PAH interstitial lung disease account majority scleroderma related death . This emphasize need novel therapy interstitial lung disease scleroderma , order improve mortality morbidity outcome patient . The ﬁbrosis skin internal organ SSc believe caused transition quiescent ﬁbroblasts activate myofibroblasts , characteristically overproduce dermal ﬁbrillar collagen ( type I , III , V ) , collagen-modifying enzyme extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components2 . One major cytokine involve process transform growth factor TGF β1 3 . TGF-β normally secrete latent complex , require activate extracellular region bind receptor exert biological effect . In dermal ﬁbroblasts , several membrane protein , include integrin αVβ5 thrombospondin 1 ( TSP1 ) , catalyze activation latent TGF-β local microenvironment4,5 . Binding TGF-β type II receptor ( TRII ) recruit type I receptor ( TRI ) activate series signal transduction pathway include core Smad pathway ( canonical pathway ) non-Smad pathway ( mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK ] , Rho , etc ) . TRI phosphorylates Smad3 S423/S425 within C-terminal MH2 . The activated pSmad3 bind Smad4 form activate heteromeric Smad complex . The pSmad3/Smad4complexes enter nucleus associate transcription factor regulate transcription target gene require collagen synthesis , myofibroblasts transformation synthesis matrix metalloproteinases6 . Studies cyclophosphamide show inconsistent result pulmonary function survival . In Scleroderma Lung Study ( oral cyclophosphomide ) , modest improvement dyspnoea score , stabilization ( improvement ) FVC effect DLCO 1 year 7 . At 2 year , significant difference parameter placebo treatment group8 . In decision analysis use Markov model ass quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) , author conclude survival quality life benefit oral cyclophosphamide9 . Subsequent , Fibrosing Alveolitis Scleroderma Trial ( FAST ) [ intravenous cyclophosphamide follow azathioprine ] demonstrate significant improvement primary secondary end point active treatment group versus group receive placebo10 . A recent meta-analysis conclude although previous trial cyclophosphamide show statistically significant improvement lung function , show clinically significant improvement ( &gt; 10 % change lung function ) 10 . Considering risk infection serious adverse effect oral cyclophosphamide , risk benefit ratio may favorable long term use drug . The experience immunosuppressive agent like mycophenolate moeftil11 , azathioprine ( single agent ) 12 , rituximab13 limit case study open label study lack double blind randomize control study . Nonetheless , potential adverse effect associate agent raise concern regard long term administration chronic disease like SSc -ILD . Therefore , focus treatment SSc associate ILD gradually shift non- specific immunosuppressive drug specific target therapy . Many attempt make use drug target molecular pathway responsible cause fibrosis . Imatinib mesylate small molecule block specific tyrosine kinase , include c-Abl platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) kinase . Incubation culture fibroblast patient SSc healthy volunteer imatinib strongly inhibit synthesis col 1a1 , col 1a2 fibronectin-1 mRNA well protein level 90 % concentration 1.0 mg/ml14 . Treatment imatinib completely prevent development fibrosis mouse model Bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis tight-skin-1 ( tsk-1 ) mouse model SSc15 . But clinical trial patient fail reproduce effect . In randomized , placebo-controlled trial patient mild moderate Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis follow 96 week , imatinib affect survival lung function16 . The major adverse event include edema , muscle cramp creatine kinase elevation , uncontrollable diarrhea bone marrow toxicity , congestive heart failure17 . These adverse effect need particular attention clinical trial patient SSc patient often present cardiac involvement , diarrhea coexist myositis creatine kinase elevation . In addition , mild moderate edema might less well tolerated patient SSc exist skin disease patient cancer 18 . Recently , endothelin1 ( ET-1 ) , implicated pathophysiology lung fibrosis . Endothelin 1 ( ET-1 ) know induce fibroblast chemotaxis proliferation19 , promote deposition collagen20 , decrease collagenase activity , increase level fibronectin21 . But Bosentan , nonselective Endothelin receptor antagonist , randomize placebo control trial fail significant impact 6-min walk distance lung function parameter 22 . PDE5 enzyme degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( c-GMP ) , molecule responsible nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation . Recently PDE 5 inhibitor show novel antifibrotic effect increase level CGMP . Cyclic GMP turn activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase G ( PKG ) . Phosphorylation Smad3 S309 T368 within MH2 PKG prevent heterodimerization Smad4 thus disrupt nuclear translocation , result repression transcriptional activation23 . TSP1 ( thrombospondin -1 ) molecule catalyze latent TGF-b activation express high level culture SSc ﬁbroblasts ( vitro ) activate ﬁbroblasts lesional skin SSc ( vivo ) . Blockade TSP1 cyclic GMP partially abolish autocrine TGF-b signal SSc ﬁbroblasts24 . Increase level cGMP block ca2+ pump thereby improve endothelial disruption initiate event pathogenesis fibrosis . Increase NO level also help mop reactive oxygen specie implicate pathogenesis fibrosis . In Bleomycin induce pulmonary fibrosis model , PDE5 inhibition alters pulmonary right ventricular ( RV ) response intratracheal Bleomycin inhibition act suppression tissue free radical Rho kinase pathway25 . Dunkern et al show predominant PDE activity lung fibroblast attribute PDE5 , PDE1 small extent PDE4 PDE inhibitor prevent formation myofibroblasts fibroblast 26 . The evidence PDE 5 inhibitor antifibrotic mainly come effectiveness prevention treatment Peyronie 's disease ( PD ) . In rat model TGF-β1-induced PD , Valente associate , demonstrate oral sildenafil , PDE5 inhibitor protect cGMP breakdown , oral pentoxifylline , predominantly PDE4 inhibitor increase cAMP synthesis , counteract development PD-like plaque27 . In case pentoxifylline , propose well-known cAMP-cGmP signal crosstalk may responsible antifibrotic effect . In subsequent study rat model , show another PDe5 inhibitor , vardenafil , give orally different dose regimen , prevent partially reverse formation PD-like plaque . Preventive treatment high dose reduce overall collagen content , collagen iii/i ratio number myofibroblasts tGF-β1-positive cell , selectively increase apoptotic index cell ( presumably include myofibroblasts ) , PD-like plaque28 . The antifibrotic effect although initially demonstrate penile tissue , prove tissue like heat , kidney lung . These antifibrotic effect PDE5 inhibitor also see rat model diabetic nephropathy29 , experimental glomerulonephritis24 , myocardial infarction hypertrophy30 , pulmonary fibrosis . So scleroderma patient fibrosis multiple organ , beneficial effect PDE5 inhibitor may become manifold . It also find effective treat clinical manifestation systemic sclerosis like PAH digital ulcer . In double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial sildenafil idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , significant difference arterial oxygenation , carbon monoxide diffusion capacity , degree dyspnea , quality life patient treat sildenafil comparison placebo group31 . Tadalafil PDE5 inhibitor longer act sildenafil . It safe associate serious life threaten side effect recently conclude study effect tadalafil digital ulcer scleroderma patient center32 . In trial , Patients report improvement skin tighten move limb joint freely . Those patient ILD improvement least stabilization lung function ( Unpublished ) . Besides , FMD ( flow mediate vasodilation marker endothelial dysfunction ) significantly improve patient provide another basis use drug treatment pulmonary fibrosis . Hypothesis : Tadalafil , PDE5 inhibitor , virtue stabilize effect endothelial dysfunction anti-fibrotic effect , may efficacy reduce symptom due interstitial lung disease scleroderma .</detailed_description>
