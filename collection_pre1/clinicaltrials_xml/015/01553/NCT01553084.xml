	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research two-fold . First , two smoke cessation medication treatment strongest evidence effectiveness never directly compare .

Today 's smoker differ early smoker many way could influence impact smoke health ( e.g. , weight , sex , diet , socio-economic status ) ; propose work determine smoke cessation affect cardiovascular pulmonary health today 's smoker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Effectiveness &amp; Long Term Health Study Wisconsin Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study recruit treat large sample contemporary smoker former smoker age increase health risk , achieve follow over-arching aim important NHLBI mission : - Specific Aim 1 : Produce important new data treat smoking optimally conduct open label comparative effectiveness trial ( CET ) first time directly contrast two smoking cessation pharmacotherapies strongest extant evidence efficacy : combination NRT varenicline . - Specific Aim 2 : Determine impact smoke cessation biomarkers health risk factor , especially relevant CVD , today 's smoker , elucidate mechanism via cessation benefit health . - Specific Aim 3 : Identify individual great risk exacerbation biomarkers risk factor status due continue smoking , benefit cessation . This help identify individual need cessation intervention . While smoker need quit , evidence could ultimately use help focus treatment motivate smoker clinician intervene intensively patient great risk . Two secondary aim use result Primary Aim 1 develop treatment assignment algorithm optimal treatment today 's smoker use result Primary Aim 2 determine relation health biomarkers clinically meaningful disease outcomes CVD event . We re-recruit many smoking non smoke participant past longitudinal cohort study ( `` Wisconsin Smokers ' Health study '' ) 2004 . We recruit additional smoker participate comparative effectiveness trial join longitudinal cohort.. All participant enroll complete questionnaire demographic , smoke history , withdrawal symptom , affect , alcohol use , stressor , medication usage diet . They also complete structured clinical interview ass mental health . They provide blood sample test various marker cardiovascular disease risk well genetics test . They carotid ultrasound , pulmonary function test , arterial tonometry assessment , 12-lead ECGs . Participants Madison also treadmill stress test . Participants wear pedometer 1 week record daily number step . Participants provide permission staff review medical chart ass smoking-relevant diagnosis treatment . These assessment occur baseline 3 year later . A small subset assessment also conduct 1 year enrollment . Participants also complete brief phone assessment 6-month interval 3-year visit . Interested eligible smoke participant original cohort study newly recruit participant enroll new smoke cessation intervention study . Participants cessation treatment study randomly assign receive nicotine patch , nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge varenicline . If participant original cohort study eligible use study medication otherwise eligible cessation treatment , s/he assign non-randomized treatment arm receive nicotine patch ( appropriate ) . All cessation participant receive 6 individual counseling session .</detailed_description>
