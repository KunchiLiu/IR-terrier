	<brief_summary>Overview rationale : Through Swedish health care register possible vaccine effectiveness . The overall aim develop tool fast reliable evaluation vaccine focus effectiveness . In study investigator assess population impact condyloma prescribe drug HPV-vaccination estimate economic burden hospitalization due condyloma . Genital wart ( condyloma ) one common sexually transmitted disease Sweden , estimate 20 000 identified case per year , primarily treat Podofyllotoxin Immiquimod . One approve HPV vaccine also protect condyloma . In clinical trial , vaccine safe highly efficacious ( 90-100 % ) persistent infection HPV 6 11 genital wart woman men . However , result clinical trial answer question weather vaccine work deliver , would real world . By linkage Svevac , patient register Drug prescription register investigator estimate effectiveness HPV vaccine prevent case condyloma define population . Method execution : This retrospective collection data Swedish health care registry study population consist person HPV-vaccinated well non-HPV-vaccinated control group ( identify population-based register , match sex , age live area ) . The primary statistical analysis calculation prescription condyloma treatment vaccination compare non-vaccinated control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GARDASIL® POPULATION-BASED CONDYLOMA EFFECTIVENESS STUDY IN SWEDISH WOMEN BACKGROUND Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) establish necessary sufficient cause cervical cancer . Over 100 HPV type identify , 40 infect genital tract . HPV16 , follow HPV18 , frequent cervical cancer contribute 70 % invasive cervical cancer . All together , around 15 high-risk ( oncogenic ) HPV type identify . Cervical cancer second common cancer among woman globally , estimate half million new case quarter million deaths year . Two 40 genital HPV type , 6 11 , call low risk type cause genital wart ( condyloma ) . Genital warts one common sexually transmitted infection clinical burden increase past decade . The wart benign often cause mental emotional stress experience . There two available vaccine HPV . Both vaccine show 95 % efficacy HPV16 18-related precancerous lesion clinical trial follow-up time far limited 5.5 year . One vaccine , Gardasil® , also offer protection HPV 6 11 . In clinical trial , vaccine safe highly efficacious ( 90-100 % ) persistent infection HPV 6 11 genital wart woman men . Recently first study effect Gardasil® national population level publish . The study show substantial decline condyloma Australian woman introduction GARDASIL® . However , limitation study . It base entirely true population-based data , could adjust residency status could link case vaccination status . The aim study investigate whether Gardasil® effective condyloma vaccinate woman compare non-vaccinated woman use registry-based data . The study also go investigate whether Gardasil® effect case previous history condyloma , possible data . Further , try estimate economic burden hospital visit due genital wart investigate whether Gardasil® affect hospital visit . It estimate 20 000 visit health care , condyloma , one third require surgery due recurrence , one third require surgery . The study take advantage unique Swedish population-based health care database , allow link follow-up individual level . OBJECTIVES - To assess population impact Podofyllotoxin/Aldara prescription hospital visit condyloma Sweden vaccination GARDASIL® . - To assess vaccination GARDASIL® effect recurrence genital wart . - To estimate economic burden hospital visit due genital wart . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design The study historically prospective analysis population-based nationwide cohort comprise participant individual-level longitudinal information HPV vaccination status prescription Podofyllotoxin/Aldara . Vaccination status obtain national vaccination register , drug prescription register ( Sweden ) information Podofyllotoxin/Aldara drug prescription register . Information hospital visit due genital wart obtain national in- patient registry . The study observational vaccination accord local regulation , policy practice . Registers use HPV vaccination status obtain Swedish vaccination register ( SVEVAC ) Swedish drug prescription register . The Swedish vaccination register ( SVEVAC ) currently register , user-friendly web-based large-scale system , HPV vaccination Sweden nationally , since start HPV vaccination 2006 . SVEVAC hold information personal ID-number , sex , age , date vaccination , time vaccination , type vaccine , vaccine lot number , health unit ( county municipality ) . Registration personal ID-number voluntary , subject must actively state n't want registered . Written information subject inquiry consent aspects registration register base follow-up administer efficient way ( subject approval Ethics Committee ) . Present experience HPV vaccination 95 % vaccinated subject accept registration . In Sweden opportunistic HPV vaccination available since May 2006 recommend young adult . The vaccine subsidise girls age 13-17 since May 2007 Swedish drug reimbursement system . A prescription medical doctor require . All drug prescription since 2005 register national drug prescription register . To compare HPV vaccinated subject drug prescription register scrutinize complete information HPV vaccination . The drug register hold information prescription date , number dos , ID-number , sex , type vaccination . Today approximately 100 000 Swedish female vaccinate HPV vaccine , well 800 male . The majority vaccination Gardasil® ( 98 % ) . From drug prescription register obtain information Podofyllotoxina Aldara prescription , date prescription dose . In majority case prescription self-treatment home . All in-patient health care Sweden register personal ID-number national level since 1987 . The so-called Patient register keep Swedish National Board Health Welfare ( NBHW ) . From 2001 , out-patient care hospital include register . Information adverse event obtain register . The International Classification Diseases 10th revision ( ICD-10 ) use code diagnosis since 1997 . Many specialist clinic base hospital use patient register possible catch visit clinic well day surgery . Study population study size This population-based study comprise girls/women vaccinate GARDASIL® Sweden May 2005 October 2010 . The study also include woman prescribe Podofylloxin/Aldara January 2005 December 2010 also woman record hospital visit due genital wart 2005 December 2009 . The study cohort include girls/women born 1989 1996 . In way include old young girls/women may benefit subsidised vaccination within study period . As October 2010 , 98 % vaccination register Gardasil® . 108 670 woman vaccinate least one dose , 92 296 two dos 66 150 three dos . Approximately 87 % vaccinated girls/women 13 17 year age 10 % 18-25 year age . In report NBHW ( 2007 ) estimate number case condyloma 20 000 every year , take prescription Podofyllotoxin/Aldara hospital visit account . Approximately half woman . To link information vaccination status , health care data population base register data Swedish personal ID number use . Study outcome To study effect Gardasil condyloma incidence compare incidence genital wart vaccinate versus non-vaccinated woman . The majority case identify Drug prescription register 20 % find patient register . To find case Drug prescription register ACT code use Podofyllotoxin Aldara ( see ) ICD-10 code In- Out patient register . The described register also use investigate whether vaccination Gardasil change burden recurrent wart identify woman genital wart vaccination compare vaccinate . The burden hospital visit also investigate compare vaccinate non-vaccinated woman . ACT code use Drug prescription register ACT-code use Gardasil® : J07BM01 ACT-code Podofyllotoxin : D06BB04 ACT-code use Aldara : D06BB10 ICD-10 code Hospital visit due genital wart find in- patient register . The ICD-10 code use indentify patient : A63 D26 . Statistical method This cohort study data analyze use statistical method survival analysis . In particular , study population impact genital wart incidence Sweden vaccination GARDASIL® model association exposure ( vaccination status ) outcome ( genital wart determine via either prescription Podophyllotoxin/Aldara hospital visit due genital wart ) use Cox and/or Poisson regression . Incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) 95 % confidence interval use quantify effect vaccine risk genital wart . All girl follow May 2006 attain age use underlying time scale model . Because full effectiveness vaccine assume achieve 3 dos exposure include statistical model time-varying exposure classify vaccination ( unexposed ) , partially complete vaccination ( 1 2 dos ) fully vaccinate ( expose ) . The analysis account possible confounding factor sexual risk take behavior , use genital wart history marker , socioeconomic status parent type prescribe treatment ( Podophyllotoxin orAldara ) . To assess risk recurrence condyloma , IRR adjust prior genital wart history , determine way outcome , use . To estimate temporal trend economic burden hospital visit due genital wart identify report descriptive data record hospital visit due genital wart Swedish Patient registry function calendar year ( 2005-2009 ) well mode treatment ( Podophyllotoxin/Aldara /surgery ) . Limitations We exclude able catch case seek medical care . Some case visit primary health care may treat visit record anywhere . However , case receive prescription self-treatment . Because majority vaccinee 13-17 year age may genital wart vaccination therefore recurrence wart may difficult catch study population . Ethical approval The study conduct approval Ethics Committee Karolinska Institutet .</detailed_description>
