	<brief_title>Therapeutic Angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) Treating Patients With Metastatic Sarcoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate chemotherapy-refractory sarcoma 20 mg per day single-agent Ang ( Angiotensin ) - ( 1-7 ) 10 mg per day single-agent Ang- ( 1-7 ) excessive toxicity observe 20 mg dose . II . To evaluate toxicity associate single-agent Ang- ( 1-7 ) give patient chemotherapy-refractory sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) patient treat Ang- ( 1-7 ) . II . To evaluate accumulation Ang- ( 1-7 ) 21 day continuous treatment quantify change plasma level angiogenic peptide include placental growth factor ( PlGF ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive therapeutic angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
