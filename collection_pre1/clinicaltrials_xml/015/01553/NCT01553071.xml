	<brief_summary>In preclinical study , anti-cancer efficacy fenretinide , synthetic retinoid cause cytotoxicity mechanism include increased intracellular dihydroceramides , show enhanced safingol , stereochemical-variant dihydroceramide precursor . This phase I study represent first clinical trial employ promising combination . The drug administration schedule ( fenretinide give Days 1-5 , safingol give Days 1-2 21-day cycle ) reflect vitro observation tumor cell exposure safingol increase fenretinide efficacy safingol administration . The total dose fenretinide , 4600 mg/m2 5 day , represent 30 % total dose reduction single agent MTD dose 1280 mg/m2/day x 5 day determine PhI-42 study . This fenretinide dose expect produce plasma level 30 ? ? M . This dose reduction employ reduce potential overlap hepatic toxicity two agent . The administration reduce fenretinide dose Day 1 ( 600 mg/m2 Day 1 , escalate 1000 mg/m2/day Days 2-5 ) select due earlier observation initial exposure soy bean oil vehicle fenretinide emulsion may induce endogenous lipase , thereby permit tolerance high total dos fenretinide emulsion subsequently administer . The start dose safingol study , 210 mg/m2/day x 2 day ( 420 mg/m2 total ) , correspond 50 % recommend Phase II safingol dose ( bolus ) determine Schwartz , et al , Phase I study safingol plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 ( MTD single-agent , intravenous ( emulsion ) safingol reach Phase I safingol run-in monotherapy portion study ) , select provide adequate safety margin potential overlapping toxicity ( hepatic transaminitis ) . The study design optimize safety novel combination . Treatment administer inpatient setting . Central venous access mandate avoid potential hemolysis thrombophlebitis associate preclinical peripheral administration previous safingol formulation rat . To reduce incidence hypertriglyceridemia , revise fenretinide delivery schedule employ . Patients also encourage maintain low-fat diet fenretinide administration . Serum triglyceride monitor every 12 hour . To monitor cardiac toxicity , note canine study high dose safingol plus fenretinide test , serum troponin T level monitor daily . To limit potential hepatotoxicity result possible drug interaction observe intravenous fenretinide , ceftriaxone acetaminophen pediatric patient , concurrent administration ceftriaxone , acetaminophen , fenretinide emulsion infusion prohibit .</brief_summary>
