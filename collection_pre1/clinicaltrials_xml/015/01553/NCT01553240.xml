	<brief_summary>This study use functional brain image noninvasive brain stimulation technique study brain basis developmental disorder like Autism Spectrum Disorder Asperger Disorder . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) recently approve FDA treatment depression , Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use study neurocircuitry certain symptom cluster developmental disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study area brain may something repetitive movement ( thing people ) difficulty communicate people ( problem talk , understanding , relationship people ) . The investigator try find brain area work differently people developmental disorder , Autism investigator one day improve new brain stimulation technique . The investigator screen make sure eligible study . After screen , investigator functional MRI . In procedure subject control look video develop understand social communication language skill . The investigator able understand difference brain activation patient control . The investigator also use TMS identify difference motor excitability patient healthy control .</detailed_description>
