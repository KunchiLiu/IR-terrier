	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib hydrochloride give together oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , radiation surgery alone surgery treat patient locally advanced cancer esophagus gastroesophageal junction . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together erlotinib hydrochloride radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . The primary aim phase I study evaluate safety multi-drug chemotherapy ( addition anti-epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] agent erlotinib [ erlotinib hydrochloride ] ) concomitant radiotherapy follow resection consolidative erlotinib treatment locally advanced esophageal cancer judge dose limit toxicity . Correlative endpoint include analysis pre-treatment tumor cyclin D1 expression EGFR expression/amplification . III . Correlate pathologic complete response change fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) - pre post-chemoradiation . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study erlotinib hydrochloride CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients undergo radiation therapy daily ( QD ) , 5 day week receive fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) continuously erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) QD day 1-38 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . SURGERY : Within 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient potentially resectable disease ( i.e. , complete response , partial response , stable disease ) undergo surgery remove tumor . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Within 2-4 week surgery , patient tumor demonstrate positive immunohistochemistry EGFR and/or cyclin D1 ( pretreatment biopsy residual tumor esophagectomy specimen ) receive consolidation chemotherapy comprise erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD 12 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
