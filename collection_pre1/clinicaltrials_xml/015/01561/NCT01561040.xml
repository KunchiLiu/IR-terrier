	<brief_summary>Dry eye disease ( DED ) common often inadequately treated disease tear surface eye . It cause poor vision chronic pain frequent increase age . The 1995 Report National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop Clinical Trials Dry Eye define dry eye `` disorder tear film due tear deficiency excessive evaporation , cause damage interpalpebral ocular surface associate symptom ocular discomfort '' . The International Dry Eye Work Shop ( DEWS ) committee subsequently define dry eye `` multi-factorial disease tear ocular surface result symptoms discomfort , visual disturbance , tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany increase osmolarity tear film inflammation ocular surface . '' Typically , symptom associate dry eye disease include ocular burning , foreign body sensation ( sand grit ) , photophobia ( light sensitivity ) , symptoms result overall long term discomfort patient . The propose eight week feasibility study dry eye subject confirm elevated osmolarity symptom respond nutritional therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperosmolarity major cause cell damage time result apoptosis corneal conjunctival cell . Determining patient hyperosmolarity critical allow u offer therapy correct problem . Reducing regulate osmolarity important prevent potential long-term tissue compromise . Treatment lead decrease tear osmolarity improve patient 's quality life stabilize vision , many case , simply allow patient return normal activity . Fatty Acids ( EFA ) show diminish inflammatory response many human inflammatory disease , interest use omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid disease treatment result several small study well use ( over-the-counter availability ) EFA-containing nutritional supplement , include several specifically treatment DED . Unfortunately , effect Omega 3 dry eye disease establish date . The purpose study well understand role Omega 3 play regulate tear osmolarity patient establish finding consistent dry eye disease .</detailed_description>
