	<brief_summary>Objective : Previous study suggest psycho-educational intervention deliver telephone improve adherence initial colposcopy abnormal Pap smear . To explore strategy enhance follow-up medical care recommendation , study impact theory-guided cognitive-affective barrier counsel intervention , deliver 2-4 week colposcopy appointment , inner city woman . The comprehensive telephone barrier intervention compare enhanced comparison group group receive tailored print material . Methods : Participants ( N = 211 ) recruit colposcopy clinic randomly assign : 1 ) telephone assessment barrier follow adherence recommendation combine tailor telephone barrier counsel ; 2 ) telephone assessment combine tailored barrier print brochure ; 3 ) telephone assessment barrier counsel . Participants assess baseline , 1-week , 9 15 month post-colposcopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Previous study show theory-based , tailor telephone barrier counsel significantly improve adherence colposcopy appointment abnormal pap smear result among low-income , minority woman . This study build research finding explore efficacy state-of-the-science telephone counsel intervention utilize rigorous study design . This enhance counsel intervention tailor individual 's distinctive cognitive-affective barrier profile , assess Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing ( C-SHIP ) model-guided barrier assessment tool , counsel message target five domain individual 's barrier adherence . In addition , current study design improve two way . First , comparison group current study enhance one receive notification letter , assessment cognitive-affective barrier telephone , telephone appointment reminder . Second , study longer follow-up period allow test intervention effect beyond initial colposcopy adherence . The participant follow 15 month post-colposcopy participant ' adherence medical follow-up recommendation ( ) within 12 month initial colposcopy collect study . Adherence medical follow-up 6 month 12 month measure 9 month 15 month , respectively , allow 3 month reschedule , attend , record appointment . Overall , study test whether enhanced tailor telephone barrier counsel intervention improve adherence medical follow-up abnormal pap smear among low-income , minority woman . Methods : METHODS Participants ( 211 ) randomize follow baseline condition : ) standard care ( SC ) , i.e. , cognitive-affective barrier ( CAB ) assessment deliver via phone , receipt notification letter physician regard abnormal Pap test result need undergo colposcopy , also include appointment date clinic contact number , plus telephone confirmation post-card appointment reminder ; b ) SC plus CAB counseling deliver phone ( CAB-C -T ) , i.e. , culturally-relevant/sensitive barrier-specific message draw pre-developed library design counsel individual regard specific barrier adherence , e.g. , increase risk-related knowledge , provide accurate outcome self-efficacy expectancy , address health-related value goal , moderate risk-related affect , offer active plan strategy assist self-regulation ; c ) SC plus CAB counseling deliver via Mail-Home Print Material ( CAB-C-P ) , include exactly applicable message deliver phone , print form . The tailoring message participant 's cognitive-affective barrier profile base two barrier five Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing ( C-SHIP ) category ( total 10 message ) rat important five-point scale . There 23 cognitive-affective adherence barrier group follow C-SHIP category : 1 ) risk-related encodings/perceptions ( i.e. , purpose colposcopy , presence progression HPV-related disease ) ; 2 ) risk-related expectancy belief ( i.e. , confidence ability keep appointment , fatalistic belief cancer ) ; 3 ) risk-related value goal ( i.e. , maintain modesty , importance child ) ; 4 ) risk-related affect ( i.e. , worry necessary procedure and/or progression disease , concern regard fertility ) ; 5 ) risk-related self-regulation ( i.e. , remember appointment , overcome child-care work-related conflict , transportation difficulty , ability manage negative risk-related affect ) . With regard assessment , conduct follow time point : baseline , 1-week , 9-month , 15-month post-colposcopy include following : CAB assessment ; background variable , include demographic ( e.g. , gender , age , ethnicity , education , marital employment status , household income , number child ) ; medical screen history ( e.g. , cancer diagnosis , previous Pap smear frequency ; breast exam ( self clinical ) ; mammogram abnormal result ; result index colposcopy physician recommendation medical record ; potential moderating dispositional variable , attentional style ( Monitoring-Blunting Style Scale ) ; potential mediating variable , include affective variable ( Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , Center Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale ) , cognitive-affective process variable ( knowledge , risk perception , expectancy beliefs , affect , value goal , regulatory skill ) ; outcome variable , include adherence initial diagnostic colposcopy 6- 12-months colposcopically-based follow-up diagnostic medical management recommendation , intervention evaluation . All assessment use scale develop previous research , except Powe Fatalism Inventory use assess fatalism Revised Impact Events Scale use assess affect ( i.e. , stress-related intrusive avoidant thought ) . Assessed baseline background variable ( except medical recommendation ) , moderate variable , mediate variable . The cognitive-affective barrier assess baseline . Assessed 1-week post-colposcopy 9-month 15 month follow-ups mediating variable ( except cognitive-affect barrier ) outcome variable . The medical recommendation assess 1-week post-colposcopy . Medical history also re-assessed 15-month follow-up relating interim period baseline .</detailed_description>
