	<brief_summary>The long-term objective develop tool aid making timely accurate diagnosis acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) . The immediate objective develop model accurately predict likelihood ACS base data available clinician within first 48 hour injury ( specific clinical finding supplement muscle oxygenation measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , continuous intramuscular pressure ( IMP ) perfusion pressure ( PP ) monitoring ) . Our primary outcome retrospective assessment likelihood compartment syndrome make panel clinician use follow data : - A physiologic `` fingerprint '' compose continuous pressure versus time curve , continuous oximetry value , response muscle fasciotomy perform , serum biomarkers muscle injury ( CPK level ) . - Clinical functional outcome 6 month post-injury include : sensory exam , muscle function , presence/absence myoneural deficit , patient report function use Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment ( SMFA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Prospectively enroll follow 6 month sample 200 patient . Patients receive continuous tissue perfusion monitoring use NIRS 4 leg compartment intramuscular pressure ( IMP ) via indwell catheter place anterior deep posterior compartment . These measure blind provide real time treat physician . All clinical care , include diagnosis ACS , accord current standard-of-care practiced institution . Specific Aim 2 : Convene expert panel 5 orthopaedic surgeon experience diagnosis treatment ACS retrospectively assess likelihood patient ACS . This retrospective assessment base 'patient profile ' summarize data collect part study . Specific Aim 3 : Determine extent clinician agree retrospective assessment likelihood ACS . Hypothesis : On basis know clinical functional outcome 6 month monitor information , clinician agree likelihood ACS &lt; 90 % case . Specific Aim 4 : Model panel 's assessment likelihood ACS function data available clinician within first 48 hour injury use training set data . This model use compute point estimate risk ACS ( associate 95 % confidence interval ) give patient . Specific Aim 5 : Assess , patient test/validation data set , performance model predict panel 's assessment likelihood ACS . Hypothesis : In &lt; 95 % case , panel 's assessment likelihood ACS fall within 95 % interval uncertainty predict model .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient age 18 60 2 . Weight &gt; 88 lb/40 kg 3 . Patient present one follow injury : Closed tibial shaft fracture displacement , comminution , segmental pattern Closed bicondylar tibial plateau fracture medial tibial plateauknee dislocation Open tibial shaft fracture ( Gustilo Type I , II IIIA ) Open bicondylar tibial plateau fracture medial tibial plateauknee dislocation ( Gustilo Type I , II IIIA ) Severe soft tissue crush injury lower leg Gun shot injury leg Proximal fibula fracture 4 . Injury result highenergy mechanism ( e.g . pedestrian struck ; fall &gt; 10 ft ; MVA/MCA speed &gt; 30 mph ; injury due shotgun , rifle , projectile ) 5 . The injury occur 12 hour prior initiation monitor 6 . If bilateral leg injury present , limb severely injured judgment investigator study 7 . At least one extremity must uninjured serve control muscle oximetry 8 . Patients may injuries except noted exclusion criterion 9 . Patient may impend compartment syndrome time evaluation ; however , surgeon must able initiate monitor take least one set muscle pressure obtain one set tissue oxygenation measurement prior perform fasciotomy 1 . Soft tissue wound interfere monitoring ( i.e . insertion indwell pressure catheter and/or application NIRS pad anterior deep posterior compartment leg ) 2 . Patients known peripheral vascular disease 3 . Informed consent patient legally authorize representative ( LAR ) obtain early enough begin monitor within 12 hour postinjury 4 . Nonambulatory due associate complete spinal cord injury 5 . Nonambulatory injury due preexist condition 6 . Patient speak neither English Spanish 7 . Severe problem maintain followup ( e.g . patient homeless time injury intellectually challenge without adequate family support ) . 8 . Prior extensive traumatic injury require surgery either low extremity .</criteria>
