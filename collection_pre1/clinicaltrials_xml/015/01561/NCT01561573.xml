	<detailed_description>The reduction fracture commonly perform procedure emergency department ( EDs ) . In Canadian EDs , reduction perform emergency physician ( EPs ) . The distal radius fracture common fracture require reduction . Fracture reduction time-consuming several step require : initial evaluation include x-ray , equipment personnel gathering , sedation and/or local anesthesia , reduction attempt ( ) splinting/casting , post-reduction x-ray , subsequent patient reassessment . These step negative effect ED patient throughput . Subsequent reduction attempt ( ) , patient send x-ray often uncertainty regard reduction success . Fluoroscopy generally option EP evaluate accuracy reduction . If reduction adequate , reduction attempt need . This utilizes resource , either ED orthopedic clinic operating room , depend reduction attempt make . Emergency ultrasound ( EU ) Canada become well-established part emergency medical practice recent year evidence late position statement Canadian Association Emergency Physicians ( http : //caep.ca/template.asp ? id=B5283F4158FB471AA56E480D6277C1AC ) development Canadian Emergency Ultrasound Society ( www.ceus.ca ) . A grow body literature show utility EU diagnosis reduction fracture ( 1-6 ) . A recent case report ( 7 ) show EU use aid Colles fracture reduction . Similar fluoroscopy , EU may fast accurate method determine successful fracture reduction . Unlike fluoroscopy , EU available immediately ED . EU may also obviate need post-reduction x-ray , particularly set patient yet another x-ray time orthopedic follow-up evaluate interval loss reduction . Thus , EU potential significantly reduce time discharge . Our study follow objective : - To assess EU utility guide reduction attempt distal radius fracture . - To compare EU x-ray final assessment reduction adequacy .</detailed_description>
