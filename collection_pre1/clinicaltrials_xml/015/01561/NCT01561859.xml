	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic highly disable disorder , make imperative apply intervention alter deleterious effect early possible . Impairments neurocognition social cognition , appear link impaired structural functional integrity key brain region , strong predictor functional disability early course schizophrenia , make key target early intervention . Although pharmacologic treatment cognitive impairment currently limit , study others , include meta-analyses show cognitive rehabilitation effective address cognitive impairment chronic patient . Most notably , Cognitive Enhancement Therapy ( CET ) , unique integrate approach rehabilitation social non-social cognitive impairment develop test Hogarty colleague group , show substantial lasting effect chronic schizophrenia patient . Recently , investigator show beneficial effect CET successfully extend early phase disorder , result large functional improvement . The investigator posit CET particularly effective early intervention strategy capitalize fronto-temporal plasticity reserve , investigator observe compelling , albeit preliminary evidence CET indeed slow progression gray matter loss region brain , associate significantly improve cognition ( see Preliminary Studies ) . Preserved structural integrity improve brain function fronto-temporal region may critical mechanism support cognitive improvement early course schizophrenia , yet remarkably little known neurobiologic effect cognitive rehabilitation , durability effect post-treatment , whether initial fronto-temporal reserve portends great treatment response . Our excite preliminary finding neuroprotective effect CET represent first study demonstrate structural integrity brain early course schizophrenia alter use cognitive rehabilitation . It critical morphologic finding examine advanced imaging technique large sample gain precise understanding underlie neurobiologic mechanism predictor cognitive functional enhancement early course schizophrenia . These goal reflective strategic plan NIMH identify underlying neural mechanism mental disorder facilitate treatment , personalize care optimize treatment response . To accomplish , investigator propose use comprehensive structural functional imaging method study 102 new early course schizophrenia patient treat 18 month randomize trial CET Enriched Supportive Therapy ( EST ) : Aim # 1 : Confirm neuroprotective effect CET fronto-temporal brain structure . Structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) assessment collect along cognitive functional outcome data baseline , 9 , 18 month . It hypothesize patient treat CET demonstrate decrease loss fronto-temporal gray matter relative EST , neuroprotection mechanism cognitive functional improvement . Effects key brain region also explore ; Aim # 2 : Examine effect CET fronto-temporal brain function . Functional MRI data use establish executive social cognition paradigm collect baseline , 9 , 18 month along cognitive functional outcome data . It hypothesize CET patient demonstrate enhance fronto-temporal brain activity task relative EST ( see Section 3C.6.2 specific prediction ) , enhance brain activity mechanism cognitive functional improvement . Changes fronto-temporal functional connectivity relation improve brain structure cognition also explore ; Aim # 3 : Examine durability CET effect fronto-temporal brain structure function , cognition , functional outcome 1 year post-treatment . Identical neuroimaging , cognitive , behavioral data collect assessed active treatment . It hypothesize differential neurobiologic benefit CET relative EST observe Aims 1 2 , cognitive functional benefit CET observe active treatment sustain 1 year post-treatment . Exploratory Aim : Explore effect fronto-temporal structural functional reserve CET treatment response . Moderator analyse examine whether pre-treatment fronto-temporal structural functional brain reserve ( operationalized Section 3C.8.2 ) predict large cognitive functional gain CET . Exploratory analysis also examine degree later ( 18 mo ) treatment improvement dependent upon early ( 9 mo ) neuroprotection increase brain function , may reflect plasticity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients include : 1. diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder verify SCID ( data patient condition respond similarly CET ) ; 2. duration since first psychotic symptom &lt; 5 year ; 3. stable positive symptom ( Clinical Global Impression score &lt; 4 least 2 month [ i.e. , 2 consecutive visit ] ) ; 4. currently maintain compliant prescribe antipsychotic medication ; 5. age 1835 year ; 6. significant social cognitive disability base Cognitive Style Social Cognition Eligibility Interview25 utilize previous CET study ; 7. current IQ &gt; 80 ; 8. ability read ( sixth grade level high ) speak fluent English . This study early course schizophrenia , firstepisode schizophrenia . A duration illness since first psychotic symptom &lt; 5 year adequate define early phase illness , particularly give average duration untreated psychosis year more.76 Eligibility criterion regard IQ justify previous experience CET indicating individual severe mental incapacity well serve less cognitively advanced program . In order avoid confounders likely affect cognition limit response cognitive rehabilitation , exclude : 1. significant neurological medical disorder may produce cognitive impairment ( e.g. , seizure disorder , traumatic brain injury ) ; 2. persistent suicidal homicidal behavior ; 3. recent ( within past 3 month ) history substance abuse dependence ; 4.
