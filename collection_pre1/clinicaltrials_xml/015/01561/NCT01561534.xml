	<brief_summary>The rehabilitation patient affect defect jaws tumor resection still challenge . Resection lead significant facial deformity , impaired oral function speech , swallow , saliva retention , concomitant psychological problem . Moreover , loss teeth alveolar basal jawbone lead significant impairment mastication . The reconstruction defect autogenous bone graft revascularized free flap become valuable mean rehabilitation patient . Major benefit procedure include usually low morbidity donor site extensive length bone graft . Moreover , vascularized graft provide good bulk bone place implant satisfactory contour . In fact , reconstruction , local hard soft tissue condition often exclude integration conventional denture impairment dental prosthetic retention thin cutaneous tissue , thickness subcutaneous tissue , absence perilingual vestibular groove , fragility soft tissue . In Literature well established high biologic value vascularize fibula graft regard potential implant osseointegration , seem equal regional mandibular maxillary bone eventually capable provide sufficient stabilization prosthesis . It must keep mind final prosthetic success may affect difficulty clinical scenario . These include limited open scar-contracted oral cavity , huge amount soft tissue cover fibula , little information profile underlie harvest bone , need limited bony exposure field may well irradiate may cause poor prosthetically-guided implant position eventually disappointing result dental rehabilitation , either functionally esthetically . It postulate complication overcome , least reduced , adopt new method compute tomography ( CT ) -assisted implant surgery .</brief_summary>
