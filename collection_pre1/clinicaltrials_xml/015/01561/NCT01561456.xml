	<brief_title>Study AXL1717 Compared Docetaxel Treat Squamous Cell Carcinoma Adenocarcinoma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Small-Cell lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) common form lung cancer , treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy provide 10 % reduction risk death patient advance NSCLC . One-third non-resectable advanced NSCLC patient second line receive chemotherapy treatment . In absence treatment Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) NSCLC patient dismal , range 6-8 week , treatment modestly improve median PFS 10-11 week . Therefore , overall poor prognosis patient advance NSCLC , development new agent urgently need . AXL1717 small molecule experimental product develop Axelar AB anticancer agent oral administration . AXL1717 inhibit insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) , often express lung tumor mediate proliferation lung cancer cell resistance therapy . Results previous preclinical clinical study indicate AXL1717 tolerable effective patient previously-treated , advanced squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) adenocarcinoma ( AC ) histological subtypes NSCLC . This open label , randomize , multi-center , Phase II study investigate AXL1717 compare docetaxel patient squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) adenocarcinoma ( AC ) lung . Patients previously treat , locally advanced metastatic SCC AC subtypes NSCLC need additional treatment enrol study . Patients randomize either AXL1717 docetaxel group monotherapy , 3:2 ratio NSCLC subtype . Patients AXL1717 group receive 400 mg AXL1717 twice daily ( BID ) oral suspension 21 day per cycle ; i.e . daily four cycle unless dose interruption , delay , reduction require . Docetaxel administer standard treatment ( 75 mg/m2 IV infusion 1 hour ) every three week throughout 4-cycle study . The primary objective study compare rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) 12 week patient treat AXL1717 patient treat docetaxel . Additional efficacy safety parameter monitor throughout study . Patients treat AXL1717 respond treatment remain stable end 4 cycle may offer extension treatment AXL1717 .</detailed_description>
