	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Chimeric Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibody ChiLob 7/4 Treat Advanced Malignancies Refractory Conventional Anti-cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study establish safety maximum tolerate dose Chi Lob 7/4 . In line establish antineoplastic , chimeric monoclonal antibody therapy Rituximab , Chi Lob 7/4 give slow intravenous infusion every week total four week . This treatment regimen facilitate early , rapid dose dense administration antibody patient group advance malignancy refractory conventional treatment . The start dose infusion Chi Lob 7/4 0.5mg ( give total dose per patient 2mg divide 4 week ) . Escalation one treatment dose level another permit least 3 patient complete treatment without dose limit toxicity .</detailed_description>
