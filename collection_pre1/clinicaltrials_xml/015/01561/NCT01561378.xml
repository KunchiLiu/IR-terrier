	<brief_title>Cardiac Surgery Neuroprotection Study Elders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly half intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission consist adult &gt; 65 year old , age group high risk develop cognitive decline delirium ICU . Over 50 % 70 % critically ill cardiac surgery patient develop post-operative delirium ( POD ) post-operative cognitive decline ( POCD ) , respectively . These two form acute cognitive dysfunction associate increased mortality poor functional recovery . While distinct condition , POD associate subsequent development POCD , suggest mechanistic link . No proven pharmacologic treatment target prevention POD POCD elderly patient exist date . Recent data suggest insulin administer central nervous system via intranasal delivery improve cognitive function elderly patient Alzheimer 's disease mild cognitive impairment . However , utility prevent POD POCD elderly critically ill patient investigate . The hypothesis study intranasal insulin prevent POD POCD elderly critically ill patient admit intensive care unit undergoing cardiac surgery . To test hypothesis , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded Phase II study enroll 60 patient &gt; = 65 year old undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft and/or valve surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass , treat either 40 IU aspart insulin placebo intranasally surgery four time day 7 day hospital discharge ( whichever occurs first ) .</detailed_description>
