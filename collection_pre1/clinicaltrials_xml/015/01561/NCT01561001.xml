	<brief_summary>Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) associate inadequate drainage aqueous humor via trabecular meshwork towards systemic circulation . This may lead increase IOP may damage optic nerve . The purpose glaucoma management low IOP order prevent progression optic neuropathy subsequent visual loss . Firstline treatment usually include IOP-lowering drug therapy . However , IOP remain uncontrolled and/or optic nerve damage progress despite control IOP , surgery may indicate . Deep sclerectomy collagen implant ( DSCI ) non-penetrating surgical procedure treatment open angle glaucoma allow enhancement aqueous outflow . This form rationale conduct prospective , open label study ass 24-hour IOP fluctuation profile record Triggerfish® patient POAG DSCI .</brief_summary>
