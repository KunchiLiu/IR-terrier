	<detailed_description>Background : Metformin hydrochloride , biguanide , effective treatment type 2 diabetes , lower basal postprandial hyperglycemia either monotherapy combination antihyperglycemic drug . Metformin hydrochloride immediate release form ( IR ) use decade treatment type 2 diabetes . An IR formulation release entire drug within 1-2 h dosing , result high drug concentration GI ( gastrointestinal ) tract may associate GI side effect ( especially nausea , diarrhea ) 20-30 % patient . This limit tolerate dose , reduce adherence result discontinuation therapy . In addition , frequent need administer metformin two three time daily may also support good adherence therapy . Metformin hydrochloride extend release ( ER ) formulation develop overcome problem . Because metformin get absorb first part small intestine , extend release metformin hydrochloride formulation employ various novel gastric-retentive technique . The polymeric matrix ( hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose ) extend release metformin tablet design swell gastric fluid . As matrix swell , become resistant peristalsis easily retain stomach . Gastric fluid penetrates matrix , dissolve drug diffuses matrix liquefied form . Metformin hydrochloride thus slowly release matrix tablet absorb gastric fluid pass small intestine . The slow release drug GI tract permit daily dose also reduce incidence nausea ( 6.5 % ) diarrhea ( 9.6 % ) . These factor particularly relevant increase treatment adherence long term therapy like anti-diabetic medication . Glimepiride , new generation sulphonylurea , dose 1-8mg/day , effective treatment option non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) patient . Oral bioavailability approximately 100 % absence food interaction guarantee highly reproducible pharmacokinetics drug . A combination tablet formulation sustain release metformin hydrochloride glimepiride beneficial term convenience administration patient compliance . Metformin hydrochloride extended-release formulation generally give daily even meal . Administration food increase bioavailability metformin hydrochloride . Food increase extent absorption ( AUC ) metformin hydrochloride ( AUC 13306 ng h/ml high fat breakfast , AUC 10200 ng h/ml low fat breakfast , AUC 7506 ng h/ml fast condition ) . Food either cause change increase Cmax drug . One study report effect food Cmax metformin [ high fat meal ( 1018 ng/ml ) , low fat meal ( 992 ng/ml ) fast condition ( 1022 ng/ml ) ] . In contrast , healthy volunteer study Glucophage SR 1000mg , food increase extent absorption ( AUC ) 77 % , peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) 26 % prolonged time peak plasma concentration ( Tmax ) 1 hour compare fasting state . The mechanical stress grind action stomach fed state could introduce variability extend release tablet contain metformin hydrochloride break rapidly anticipate . Because food prolongs gastric retention time , extend release formulation administer food expose long duration mechanical stress stomach . The latter raise possibility increase release rate ( intend ) drug formulation . This result high risk 'dose dump ' , create potential safety risk patient . Therefore clinically important ass effect food extend release formulation metformin hydrochloride metformin hydrochloride/glimepiride . Study Rationale : Extended release formulation metformin hydrochloride India include metformin SR 1000mg tablet metformin hydrochloride SR 1000mg/glimepiride 2mg tablet . In combination tablet , metformin hydrochloride extend release form . In view fact extend release metformin hydrochloride usually recommend meal , food know affect PK parameter metformin potential dose dump extended release formulation may lead side effect similar IR formulation , study estimate magnitude food effect formulation feed state compare fast state warrant . The safety tolerability profile metformin SR 1000mg tablet metformin hydrochloride SR 1000mg/glimepiride 2mg tablet also evaluate study . Objectives : Primary : To compare pharmacokinetics bioavailability metformin give feed condition either metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet fix dose combination metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR/glimepiride 2mg tablet give fast condition metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet healthy Indian volunteer . Secondary : To compare safety tolerability metformin hydrochloride give fed condition either metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet fix dose combination metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR/glimepiride 2mg tablet give fast condition metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet healthy Indian volunteer . Study Design/Schematic : This study randomize , single-center , open-label , single-dose , three-period , 6 sequence crossover study healthy adult volunteer estimate bioavailability metformin metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet give fast condition relative metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet fix dose combination metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR /glimepiride 2mg tablet , give fed condition . 30 healthy adult male randomize receive single dose metformin hydrochloride SR ( 1000mg ) fast state metformin hydrochloride SR ( 1000mg ) feed state fix dose combination metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR /glimepiride 2mg tablet feed state treatment period . There 6 treatment sequence washout 7 day three treatment period . Subjects screen visit within 21 day prior first dose study drug , follow three treatment period , contain single dose study drug , follow 30 hour serial PK sample collection . Subjects check unit Day +1 collection 30 hour PK sample . Subjects instructed return next treatment period final follow-up visit , appropriate . The final follow-up visit occur 7 day last dose study drug . Subjects assign three treatment randomly per randomization schedule . Study participant check study unit clinical research organisation least 12 hour prior dose remain clinical research unit 36 hour administration investigational product . In fast fed condition , pre-dose dinner administer 11 hour prior dose drug . Following 10-hour overnight fast , subject randomize per predetermine randomization sequence three study treatment arm ratio 1:1:1 administer single oral dose study drug ( A : metformin SR 1000 mg fast state , B : metformin SR 1000 mg feed state , C : metformin SR 1000 mg/glimepiride 2 mg feed state ) treatment period 1 . In subsequent two study period , subject receive treatment , accord randomisation schedule subject receive treatment . In fast condition , dose drug take place schedule time follow breakfast , lunch dinner 4 , 8 13 hour post dose respectively . On D+1 ( day dose day ) , breakfast lunch provide 25 hour 30 hour post dose respectively . In fed condition , breakfast serve scheduled time . The dose drug schedule time dose fast condition . Lunch , snack dinner serve 4 , 9 13 hour post dose respectively . On D+1 , breakfast lunch provide 25 hour 30 hour post dose respectively . According CDSCO recommendation high-fat breakfast BA/BE feed state study , participant must consume high-fat breakfast ( 950-1000 kcal , least 50 % calorie fat , 15-20 % protein rest carbohydrate ) approximately 15minutes prior dosing . A random high fat breakfast sample serve study send analysis caloric breakdown test meal calculate . In , fast feed condition , study medication administer 240 ml 20 % glucose solution . Thereafter , 60 ml 20 % glucose solution administer every 15 minute 4 hour dose . In period , total 18 blood sample collect use pre-labelled 6ml K3EDTA vacutainers per follow schedule : 0.0 ( pre-dose ) 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 24 30 hour dose . The volunteer house 36 hour dose . The bioanalyst blind study treatment receive subject .</detailed_description>
