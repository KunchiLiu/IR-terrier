	<brief_summary>Adjuvant use fibrin glue fistula tract may promote heal low-output enterocutaneous fistula . However , study report autologous glue application large patient group clinical-controlled study set . The aim study investigate efficacy safety autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue ( PRFG ) treatment low-output digestive fistula compare conservative management without use adjuvant application FG fistulous tract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sudden appearance intestinal content drain abdominal incision emotionally devastating experience patient surgeon . An enterocutaneous fistula ( ECF ) abnormal communication bowel lumen skin , often associate fluid electrolyte abnormality , malnutrition , sepsis . It report spontaneous fistula closure rate vary 15 % 71 % conservative treatment wound care , control infection , nutritional support . Sufficient time allot ECF heal conservative treatment , also result long-term discomfort . Adjuvant use fibrin glue ( FG ) fistula tract may promote heal low-output ECF . Containing high concentration human fibrinogen thrombin , FG use extensively many surgical field biological adhesive system tissue adhesion hemostasis . Different type FG employed : commercially produce homemade autologous adhesive . Currently available FDA-approved commercial product Tisseel , Artiss ( Baxter , Westlake Village , CA , USA ) , Evicel ( Johnson &amp; Johnson , Somerville , NJ , USA ) widely use clinical application . Risks infection transmission , allergic reaction , also high cost , however , still make autologous FG attractive . Additionally , comparison adhesive , autologous compound several advantage term biocompatibility biodegradation . The aim study investigate efficacy safety autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue ( PRFG ) treatment low-output digestive fistula compare conservative management without use adjuvant application FG fistulous tract .</detailed_description>
