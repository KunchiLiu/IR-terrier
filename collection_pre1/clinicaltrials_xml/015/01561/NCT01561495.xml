	<brief_summary>This study proton radiotherapy pre- post- operative treatment patient extremity sarcoma . This study treat patient two dose group : 1. patient receive pre-operative proton therapy 2. patient receive post-operative proton therapy . In dose group , study divide two phase . In first phase study , investigator determine treatment proton therapy safe deliver regular basis . In second phase , investigator determine proton therapy less long term side effect compare standard radiation pre-operative patient post-operative patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study perform two phase . In first phase , feasibility establish use primary objective set . The second part begin early 30 day last patient initial phase complete treatment safety feasibility verify . The primary objective study feasibility . The study deem infeasible 10 % patient experience one following : 1 . Patient give treatment anatomy dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan devise ( 95 % planning target volume cover 95 % dose ) . 2 . Patient unable tolerate 25 % treatment ( reasonable set patient within acceptable limit tolerance , patient unable tolerate treatment position immobilization duration treatment ) use proton radiotherapy . Note : end-point proton-therapy specific , indicate feasibility proton oppose photon radiotherapy . For example , proton-specific patient immobilization/positioning well tolerate extra time treatment position long uncomfortable , proton deliver per protocol would deem feasible compare photon . Any treatment deliver proton deliver use photon , patient receives prescribe tumor dose . 3 . Patient unable complete his/her treatment within 10 day estimate date treatment completion require treatment break great 5 day . Additionally , great 33 % patient experience significant toxicity . Primary Objectives second phase study : - The primary objective Phase II pre-operative group evaluate wound complication rate pre-operative proton radiotherapy patient STS low extremity . - The primary objective Phase II post-operative group evaluate functional outcome ( e.g. , fibrosis , joint stiffness , edema ) two year post-operative proton radiotherapy patient STS low extremity . Secondary Objectives phase study : - To assess local control rate , progression-free survival overall survival proton radiotherapy STS extremity . - To determine acute late toxicity proton radiotherapy extremity . - To monitor effect proton treatment tumor normal tissue use radiographic imaging ( cohort ) ex-vivo analysis tissue sample ( pre-operative cohort ) . - To examine relationship pre-treatment hypoxia determine F18-EF5 scan treatment outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologic diagnosis soft tissue sarcoma extremity eligible study . Patient must 18 year age . Patients must evidence disease limited extremity . For preoperative group , patient must consider operable/resectable candidate preoperative radiotherapy judge attend surgeon radiation oncologist . The clinical evaluation patient include work per standard care . All patient preoperative group evaluate protocol PRIOR initiation therapy . For postoperative group , patient must consider operable/resectable ( evaluated prior resection ) candidate postoperative radiotherapy attend surgeon radiation oncologist . The clinical evaluation patient include work per standard care . Patients postoperative group may evaluate PRIOR initiation therapy may refer evaluation surgical resection . ECOG status 02 . Patients must sign document indicate aware investigative nature treatment protocol , potential benefit risk . Patients unwilling unable sign inform consent exclude study . Women childbearing potential long agree use recognize method birth control ( e.g . oral contraceptive , IUD , condom barrier method etc. ) . Hysterectomy menopause must clinically document . Negative urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential day F18EF5 PET scan prior F18EF5 injection Pregnant woman , woman plan become pregnant woman nurse . Patients experience surgical complication prevent radiation start 5 month , unless evidence gross residual disease .</criteria>
