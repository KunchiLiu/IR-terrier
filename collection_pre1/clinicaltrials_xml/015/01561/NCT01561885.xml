	<detailed_description>This study pragmatic randomize controlled trial . To date , scarcity randomize control trial look pathway-based , patient-centered healthcare versus usual care several high-risk high volume diagnosis account vast majority hospitalization medical setting . In study , pathway care intervention collaborative effort involve healthcare professional multiple department , include pharmacist , health educator , nurse , social worker , nutritionist , quality management . For patient allocate usual care , healthcare professional deliver standardize care consult . For pathway care patient , collaborative healthcare default .</detailed_description>
