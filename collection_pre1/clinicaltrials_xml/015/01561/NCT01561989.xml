	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Flu Vaccine Treating Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 level immunologic response ( antibody responses week 4 [ 4 week ( +/- 7 day ) ] post-vaccination ) injectable seasonal ( 2011-2012 ) trivalent influenza vaccine among Roswell Park Cancer Institute ( RPCI ) employee . ( Observational component ) II . To examine effect vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) supplementation immunologic response ( antibody response Week 16 [ 4 week ( +/- 7 day ) ] post-vaccination ) injectable seasonal ( 2012-2013 ) trivalent influenza vaccine among RPCI employee . ( Intervention component ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To track occurrence flu-like illness study population November 1 , 2011 April 1 , 2012 , use standardize epidemiologic questionnaire . ( Observational component ) II . To determine relationship 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 level time vaccination immunologic responses Week 20 ( 8 week [ +/- 7 day ] ) Week 24 ( 12 week [ +/- 7 day ] ) follow administration inject seasonal ( 2012-2013 ) trivalent influenza vaccine . ( Intervention component ) III . To track occurrence flu-like illness study population November 2012 April 2013 , use standardize epidemiologic questionnaire . ( Intervention component ) IV . To evaluate association single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) polymorphisms deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence vitamin-D3 metabolizing enzyme , measure vitamin-D3 metabolism ( 24,25 hydroxy [ OH ] vitamin D3 ) response seasonal ( 2012-201 ) trivalent influenza vaccine . ( Intervention component ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive low-dose cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 week , follow seasonal ( 2012-2013 ) trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) . ARM II : Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol PO QD 12 week , follow seasonal ( 2012-2013 ) trivalent influenza vaccine IM . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
