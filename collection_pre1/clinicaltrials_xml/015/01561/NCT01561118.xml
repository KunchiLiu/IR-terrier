	<brief_summary>Physical activity consider essential optimal health , development , socialization well-being child . However patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) often restrict participation exercise activity . This especially true child hemodialysis ( HD ) . As consequence exercise capacity reduce , , impressively HD . In nationwide randomize , multi-center design study aim proof influence individualise endurance training program bicycle ergometer perform dialysis efficacy HD , measure single pool Kt/V . Secondary goal enhance physical performance , physical mental well-being , improve measurable blood treatment parameter ( e.g . haemoglobin level , amount medication ) . A positive impact physical activity observe adult HD , although study address issue randomise protocol . Despite beneficial evidence adult , sport still integrate part standard care patient maintenance HD . The study protocol , develop close collaboration German Sport University Cologne , differs substantially previously publish report us bicycle ergometer train upright position outside dialysis couch adapts intensity intervention patient 's capability . Based expected result investigator develop individualised training program integrate standard care ( pediatric ) patient maintenance HD .</brief_summary>
