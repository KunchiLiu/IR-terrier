	<brief_summary>Breast Cancer affect 1 8 American woman . Twenty percent breast cancer patient undergo form breast reconstruction . Several type reconstructive procedure available appropriate patient . A reconstructive sequence consist tissue expander follow permanent implant placement popular choice many woman . In past several year , acellular dermal matrix ( allograft ) use time tissue expander placement extend submuscular coverage . Reported benefit include ability initially fill expander great extent , improve control inframammary crease , possible decrease capsular contracture rate . Potential disadvantage dermal allograft include foreign body reaction , incomplete tissue integration , increased infection rate . The latter especially worrisome , infection set tissue expander often necessitate removal implant interruption reconstructive sequence . There scattered report use dermal autograft implant-based breast reconstruction , widely use . Dermal autograft carry potential benefit improved tissue integration lower complication rate . However , date study compare acellular dermal allograft matrix dermal autograft use breast reconstruction . The objective study compare dermal allograft dermal autograft respect cost , tissue integration , patient satisfaction scar , complication profile patient undergo mastectomy follow tissue expander/implant reconstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Dermal Autograft AlloDerm Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This retrospective comparative study two establish therapy . It design enroll patient undergo breast reconstruction tissue expanders/implants . Two group create . One patient receive acellular dermal allograft submuscular coverage second group patient undergo dermal autograft submuscular coverage . Patients low abdominal scar sufficient abdominal laxity autograft harvest offer technique . The subset patient elect undergo autografting comprise autograft group . The allograft group consist patient without suitable abdomen autografting decline autograft procedure . Patients allograft group placement dermal allograft low pole tissue expander . Patients autograft group undergo harvest dermal autograft low abdomen time mastectomy , use cover low pole tissue expander . The following data record unidentifiable fashion : age , medical history , type breast cancer treatment , type reconstruction include implant type , brand , implant size characteristic , time surgery include autograft harvest , cost overall procedure . Patients receive routine follow-up care , presence complication record . Per standard reconstructive sequence implant-based breast reconstruction , patient undergo second surgical procedure general anesthesia approximately three month follow initial surgical procedure replacement tissue expander permanent implant capsulotomy . At time procedure , three small sample internal capsule harvest standard location 4mm biopsy punch . Histology H/E factor VIII staining perform sample measure inflammation , tissue architecture , vascular ingrowth . Comorbidities patient without acellular dermal matrix evaluate use Fisher exact test . Group differences continuous variable assess test . Statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
