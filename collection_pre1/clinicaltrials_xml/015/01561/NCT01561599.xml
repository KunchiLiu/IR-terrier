	<brief_title>Study Delayed Graft Function Using Paired Kidneys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplantation effective cost-efficient form renal replacement therapy burgeon population present end-stage renal disease . Although organ donation become national priority , gap number patient await kidney versus number available kidney continue widen exponentially . In many country within European Union , utilization `` donation cardiac death '' ( DCD ) kidneys steadily increase , expand donor pool &gt; 50 % . Given high incidence cardiac death US , aggressive pursuit DCD kidney pool could potentially reduce waitlist period month , day . Risk delay graft function ( DGF ) attendant risk increase recipient morbidity , chronic allograft nephropathy increase medical cost however temper DCD kidney utilization country . Development strategy limit normothermic reperfusion injury , promote renal repair , reduce incidence and/or duration DGF improve long-term outcome greatly enhance acceptance recruitment DCD kidney . The study design evaluate safety efficacy intravenously administer drug recipient kidneys DCD donor risk develop DGF . This trial unique compare drug versus placebo outcome kidney recipient donor direct evaluation function ( creatinine clearance ) graft .</detailed_description>
