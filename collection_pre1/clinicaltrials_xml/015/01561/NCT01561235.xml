	<detailed_description>Dietary protein appear satiate thermogenic macronutrient ( 7-11 ) . However , protein exerts effect appetite fully know . The effect suggest related high oxidation rate protein compare carbohydrate fat ( 12 ) , also great thermogenic effect cause great increase core temperature ( 13 ) . The involvement peripheral appetite-regulating hormone sparingly investigate ( 14 ) . These study include two preloads different concentration protein . This optimal design investigate protein dose-dependent effect threshold reach two concentration . The effect protein mainly investigate glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , ghrelin , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , generally intake protein 35 % energy content ( 35E % ) ( 5 ; 15-18 ) . The relationship appetite-regulating hormone appetite still elusive due contradict result . Only one study investigate effect protein preloads 50E % . Bowen et al . ( 19 ) find high protein preloads could decrease concentration CCK rate gastric emptying , show enhance satiate effect food ( 20-22 ) . Thus need examine effect protein appetite-regulating hormone dose-response manner order detect whether interaction relate change subjective sensation appetite EI ( 14 ) . This examine compare two isocaloric meal protein content one macronutrient vary whereas third macronutrient keep fix . Thus , objective study investigate mechanism responsible satiate effect protein three isocaloric test meal protein content 14 , 25 50 E % protein . A possible dose-response effect protein investigate number appetite-regulating hormones/peptides , together change ad libitum energy intake . Design : 25 men participate 3-way , randomize , double-blind , crossover study . The test meal isocaloric 30E % fat increase protein content expense carbohydrate . Test meal : normal protein content ( NP , 14E % protein ) , medium-high protein content ( MHP , 25E % ) , high protein content ( HP , 50E % ) . Four-hour subjective appetite rating blood sample assess every half-hour . Subsequently , subject serve ad libitum lunch .</detailed_description>
