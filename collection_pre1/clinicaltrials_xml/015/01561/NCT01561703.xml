	<brief_title>Comparing Healthcare Utilization Between Adenotonsillectomy Patients With Without Postoperative Antibiotic Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective trial provide evidence prescribe postoperative antibiotic increase number phone call physician , increase number emergency department/urgent care/clinic visit postoperative period , increase medical diagnostic cost ( ie : labwork , culture , x-ray ) . Additionally , investigator aim provide evidence high percentage patient give prescription antibiotic ultimately obtain prescription another provider . One common surgical procedure perform pediatric population tonsillectomy . The term `` tonsillectomy '' refers surgical excision entire tonsil tissue may may include excision adenoid tissue well . Typical symptom follow surgery pain , malaise , fever among others . Otolaryngologists many year prescribe antibiotic postoperatively base early randomize control trial suggest benefit improved recovery . A recent poll show 79 % otolaryngologist routinely prescribe antibiotic reduce postoperative morbidity antibiotic prophylaxis . The American Academy Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery ( AAOHNSF ) recently publish evidenced-based Clinical Practice Guideline tonsillectomy child routine use postoperative antibiotic evaluate . Evaluation recent literature show routine use post-operative antibiotic show benefit improve main measure perioperative morbidity . Multiple individual trial show antibiotic use impact pain , amount analgesic use , recovery time , time required return normal diet . However , routine antibiotic use prevention postoperative fever remain controversy show benefit two trial show benefit two different trial . Considering lack support evidence benefit reduce postoperative morbidity , AAOHNSF issue strong recommendation routine administration postoperative antibiotic tonsillectomy . The investigator experience busy pediatric surgical service 1-2 week follow tonsillectomy , physicians clinic commonly receive phone call concerned parent regard local refer pain , bad breath , fever . Despite patient education several step process , parental phone call regard postoperative fever remain common . While post-operative fever know occur follow tonsillectomy , management issue phone , sometimes weekend , challenge . Children often pain , tired usual , eat well . Even though anticipated symptom , occur fever , difficult provide adequate reassurance concern parent . Often parent think child infection expect provider start antibiotic . From clinician perspective , difficult discern whether concurrent illness evaluate . As result , parent often bring child urgent care clinic , emergency department , physician clinic evaluation may eventually obtain antibiotic prescription complaint cover possible infection . While routine use antibiotic show benefit improve many main element morbidity , controversy remain regard reduction postoperative fever . When fever occur child take antibiotic , parent often become concerned infection desire antibiotic evaluation . The concern parent case lead unnecessary visit emergency department , urgent care clinic , physician clinic evaluation . The workup perform evaluation patient may include complete blood count , chest x-ray , urinalysis , urine culture . Ultimately , patient may give empiric antibiotic prescription . To date literature document healthcare utilization compare patient give antibiotic give antibiotic . The goal study evaluate healthcare utilization patient/caregiver burden group . If increase healthcare utilization patient/caregiver burden find `` antibiotic '' group , analysis type utilization outcome direct future effort improve patient education regard postoperative morbidity possibly continue routinely administer post operative empiric antibiotic . This benefit effort improve patient satisfaction surgery , reduce unnecessary healthcare cost , reduce unnecessary antibiotic use .</detailed_description>
