	<brief_summary>Muscle weakness atrophy important consequence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Although resistance exercise increase strength muscle mass patient COPD , response training appear suboptimal individual . A dysregulation signal pathway involve regulation muscle mass could play important role phenomenon . Hypothesis : Proteins involve muscle mass regulation less activated quadriceps patient COPD follow acute bout resistance training exercise compare healthy age-matched control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Signaling Pathway Activation After Exercise Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective investigate impact acute bout resistance training key signal pathway involve regulation muscle mass moderate severe COPD ( FEV1 60 % predict ) . Key proteins signal intramuscular pathway involve protein synthesis degradation measure 72 contraction quadriceps . The exercise protocol design match actual exercise prescription model use context pulmonary rehabilitation . A squat , leg press leg extension do 80 % max one minute rest set . A biopsy quadriceps do exercise order measure phosphorylated kinase , total protein content mRNA expression . All patient undergo thorough baseline assessment pulmonary capacity , muscle force body composition .</detailed_description>
