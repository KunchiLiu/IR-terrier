	<detailed_description>Minocycline , second-generation tetracycline , find inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthase ( NOS ) inflammatory cytokine . These primary mechanism propose explain neuroprotective neuroplastic effect several animal human model neurological psychiatric disease , include Parkinson 's disease schizophrenia . There three clinical trial minocycline schizophrenia subject . A definitive clinical trial large sample optimize cost-effective design use comprehensive cognitive battery global assessment schizophrenia symptom domain necessary examine efficacy minocycline . If minocycline improves psychopathology potentially symptom ( include cognitive function ) schizophrenia , treatment could easily implement exist treatment delivery system relatively low cost potential make significant public health impact . The investigator plan recruit 120 individual early course schizophrenia currently second-generation antipsychotic ( SGA ) medication experience persistent symptom least moderate range . In effort limit placebo response , notoriously high psychiatric population , investigator use adaptive design . Since , grow evidence support inflammatory hypothesis schizophrenia , investigator also explore whether cytokine level mediate response minocycline treatment .</detailed_description>
