	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory disease impact approximately 1 % Canadians . RA associate increased mortality , decreased life expectancy increase morbidity , primarily attributable increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Traditional risk factor ( e.g . dyslipidemia , hypertension , physical inactivity , etc . ) contribute , part , elevate risk CVD individual RA . However , high incidence CVD event RA appear independent influence traditional CVD risk factor . Non-traditional risk factor , inflammation , also contribute increase risk CVD RA patient . In fact , traditional CVD risk factor co-morbidities control people RA , marker systemic inflammation confer significant additional risk CV death . This suggest systemic inflammation significantly contribute increase risk CVD individual RA . Thus , immediate need develop intervention strategy reduce inflammatory mediate risk CVD RA population . One possible intervention could use decrease CVD risk RA patient exercise . Exercise modify traditional ( e.g . dyslipidemia ) non-traditional ( e.g . inflammation ) risk factor decrease risk CVD . For patient cardiac disease , clinical guideline recommend regular exercise . For , patient refer cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program , exercise represent cornerstone program . The goal program modify CVD risk factor , improve physical capacity decrease CVD risk . Thus , CR program may offer suitable therapeutic intervention help decrease CVD risk RA patient . However , RA patient rarely refer CR despite increase risk CVD . Thus , effect CR inflammation CVD risk patient RA remain unclear . The purpose study examine effect 12-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise program systemic inflammation CVD risk individual RA . The specific objective study : 1 ) determine whether feasible RA patient complete 12-week high intensity CR exercise program , 2 ) examine effect 12-week standardized CR exercise program systemic marker inflammation individual RA , 3 ) examine effect 12-week standardized CR exercise program CVD risk individual RA 4 ) characterize effect 12-week standardized CR exercise program severity patient 's RA functional ability . This study mean pilot study help provide insight therapeutic effect CR inflammation CVD risk RA patient . Based result preliminary work , large scale study develop evaluate effect exercise intensity cardiovascular risk patient inflammatory disease well effect exercise decision make pharmacological intervention ( e.g . statin therapy ) population . Methods : Study Design : This pilot study randomize control study . Subjects randomly assign one two group : 1 ) control ( CON ) 2 ) CR program high intensity exercise ( CRH ) . Outcome measure assess baseline ( week-0 ) post-intervention ( week-13 ) . The primary measure include CVD risk , level systemic inflammation severity RA . Secondary measure include weight , waist girth , rest heart rate , rest blood pressure ( BP ) , lipid profile , fast glucose , aerobic fitness , physical activity ( PA ) level , functional ability , tobacco use alcohol consumption . Patient Screening : If individual agrees participate study , ask use tobacco regularly diabetic , BP measure sent routine blood work . Blood test perform determine patient 's lipid profile ( total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol triglyceride ) . The patient 's BP , answer aforementioned question ( e.g . tobacco , diabetes ) lipid profile result use calculate patient 's Framingham risk score , estimate 10-year CV risk patient . Inclusion Criteria : Only patient 1 ) 20 year age old 2 ) RA fulfil American College Rheumatology criterion , 3 ) zero swollen joint , 4 ) receive stable pharmacotherapy ( define great 3 month unchanged antirheumatic drug great 1 month unchanged nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) , 5 ) moderate risk CVD identify Framingham risk score , 6 ) able walk treadmill cycle stationary bike 15 minute 7 ) able attend Community Cardiovascular Hearts Motion program ( hold Halifax Regional Municipality ) ask participate study . Any patient meet inclusion criterion , 1 ) know coronary , cerebral peripheral artery disease , 2 ) taking statin , 3 ) one arthroplasty weight bear joint , eligible participate study . Sample Size : The study recruit 60 participant , 30 CON 30 CRH.. Outcome measure : Variables pertain RA , CVD PA measure subject ( CON , CRH ) two different time point study . Specifically , subject assess baseline ( week-0 ) reassess post 12-week intervention ( week-13 ) . The post CR intervention assessment conduct 72 hour completion final exercise session . The variable measure week-0 week-13 list section B1e tool use assess outcomes describe . Of note , physicians/nurse conduct assessment blind regard group subject assign . RA Severity : Severity RA determine use American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) response score . The ACR composite score base 7 measure : 3 assessor ( swollen joint , tender joint count physician global status ) , 3 patient ( function , pain global status ) one acute phase measure ( CRP ) . The ACR examination conduct rheumatologist ( VB , Coinvestigator ) . Aerobic Fitness : The subject 's aerobic fitness determine base result stress test . All stress test conduct cardiac research nurse . In brief , subject perform grade exercise test ( Bruce treadmill protocol ) speed inclination treadmill increase every 3 minute . The subject ask exercise volitional fatigue . Cardiac function monitor 12 lead ECG . The ECG data also use determine evidence cardiac disease ( e.g . arrhythmia ) . Predictive equation develop men woman use calculate subject 's peak oxygen uptake . This value represent subject 's aerobic fitness . Physical Activity : The subject 's current level PA measure use long form International Physical Activity Questionnaire . This questionnaire suitable use clinical population use previously quantify physical activity level RA patient . Functional Ability : Functional status assess use short form Health Assessment questionnaire ( HAQ ) . This self report questionnaire comprise HAQ disability index , HAQ patient global health status pain visual analog scale . Blood Analysis : Blood sample draw either research nurse physician . Samples process local hospital determine subject 's lipid profile , fast glucose CRP level . Serum also extract blood sample . Markers systemic inflammation ( cytokine ) quantify serum sample . Specifically , test quantify level proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-17 TNFα well anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 IL-10 . Analysis perform Dalhousie University ( SG , PI ) use BioRad Bioplex Suspension Array System . All serum sample store -20°C require analysis . Exercise Intervention : Subjects randomly assign either CON CRH group . Subjects assign CON receive treatment RA consider standard care ( e.g . pharmacotherapy ) , enrol CR program . Subjects CON group ask maintain current level PA course 12-week study . CON subject give log book record daily activity well report significant change PA level occur study . Subjects assign exercise group ( CRH ) receive standard care RA plus enrolled CR program ( Community Cardiovascular Hearts Motion Program , Halifax Regional Municipality , NS ) . The CR program 12-weeks duration supervise nurse , physiotherapist research assistant . The CR program compose one 60 minute education session per week two 60 minute exercise session . The education session conduct multidisciplinary team health professional ( nurse , physiotherapist dietician ) . Topics cover include heart healthy eating , set health-related goal , exercise , nutrition , healthy weight , smoke cessation stress/coping . Some education session modify good suit RA subject ( e.g . CVD medication session ) . The exercise session base standard care CVD patient . Exercise session begin group warm-up activity , follow 45 minute aerobic activity end cool . Aerobic activity consist walking/running treadmill , step exercise and/or cycling cycle ergometer . The subject encourage rotate various exercise machine ( e.g . 15 minute treadmill , 15 minute cycle , 15 minute stepper ) . All aerobic exercise perform high intensity , present study define exercise elicits HR 60-80 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) . Subjects keep log book duration program detail exercise session . Subjects record rest heart rate , type exercise perform , duration exercise HR exercise session . The subject also may add relevant note . All exercise session closely monitor nurse , physiotherapist research assistant . Prior initial CR exercise session target heart rate calculate subject base maximum HR achieve stress test . Subjects taught palpate radial and/or carotid pulse first week CR program . This enable subject monitor maintain HR within target HR zone perform aerobic exercise .</detailed_description>
