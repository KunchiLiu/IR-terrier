	<brief_summary>The superiority percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) one stent another term clinical outcome usually document large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Although generate select study population data form basis evidence base practice ( EBP ) entire population patient consider coronary intervention . An inherent limitation approach study population differ significantly comer term patient characteristic prognosis undermine foundation extrapolation trial result comer . Furthermore , trial base `` one-fits-all '' concept , benefit `` individual-tailored '' approach might superior , investigate . The Purpose current study - Compare clinical outcome several CE mark drug elute stent - Compare clinical outcome several CE mark bare metal stent - Compare clinical outcome comer select study population RCT 's - Evolve method compare clinical outcome generalize `` one-fits-all '' versus individualize `` individual-tailored '' stent selection approach The Method employ - All comer PCI registry - single centre - Randomisation eligible patient within registry one several study stent - Quality assurance non-randomized population within registry periodical alternate institutional standard stent - Continuous follow patient include registry mean systematic event detection classification independent safety end point committee - Assessment effect quality life heart health questionnaires Outcome Measures Primary endpoint : - Composite cardiac death , acute myocardial infraction target vessel revascularisation - Stent thrombosis - A specifically developed Treatment Failure Rate classification Secondary outcome measure include , target lesion revascularisation total death analyze hierarchical fashion 2 , 3 , 4 5 year . Tertiary outcome measure self report quality life base health questionnaire general health cardiac symptom . Power Calculations An event rate 20 % within 5 year , relative difference 25 % ( absolute difference 5 % ) , P &lt; 5 % , Power &gt; 80 % = &gt; 900 patient two treatment arm . Prespecified Analysis include 1 . The MACE rate stent type 2 . The Stent thrombosis rate stent type 3 . The Treatment failure rate stent type 4 . The randomized population versus non-randomized population 5 . The individualized versus generalize Population 6 . QOL stent type</brief_summary>
