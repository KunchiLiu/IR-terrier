	<brief_summary>The aim study assess effect diet prior cardiac surgery common postoperative decline renal function . Until , know drug procedure preserve kidney impairment . Patients know kidney disease especially risk . A potential beneficial effect diet prior surgery show investigation mammal , therefore study investigate preoperative diet patient know kidney disease schedule heart surgery attenuate prevent postoperative loss kidney function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Title : Effect Preoperative Calorie Restriction Renal Function After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cardiothoracic surgery risk postoperative acute renal failure associate significant morbidity mortality . There drug procedure know prevent loss renal function . Experimental data suggests , preoperative caloric restriction might provide kidney protection context . This clinical trial investigates phenomenon also applicable human . Patients increase risk postoperative renal failure due know chronic kidney disease randomize 2 group . Patients diet group receive calorie restriction 60 % calculated daily energy rate day -7 day -1 ( include ) pre-surgery ( day 0 corresponds day surgery ) . Patients control group receive alimentation ad libitum . Primary objective increase serum creatinine mg/dl 24 h induction ischemia ( `` cross clamping '' ) comparison baseline value obtain morning day surgery ( day 0 ) order analyse preoperative calorie restriction preventive strategy lead attenuation postoperative kidney injury . Hypothesis : A seven day calorie restriction reduces increase serum creatinine cardiac surgery patient know chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
