	<brief_summary>Background : - FdCyd ( also call 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine ) THU ( also call tetrahydrouridine ) experimental cancer treatment drug . FdCyd may change gene work cancer cell . THU help keep FdCyd broken body . FdCyd THU give people cancer treatment trial , usually vein . Researchers want give FdCyd THU mouth see work cancer respond earlier treatment . Objectives : - To test oral FdCyd THU advance solid tumor respond earlier treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance solid tumor respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study tumor sample use study cancer treatment . - FdCyd THU give 21-day cycle . THU take 30 minute take FdCyd . - Participants take FdCyd THU mouth , day , 3 day begin first second week cycle ( day 1 3 8 10 ) . The drug take entire third week cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Treatment continue long cancer respond drug serious side effect develop ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - 5-Fluoro-2-deoxycytidine ( FdCyd ) , fluoropyrimidine nucleoside analog , short ( 10-minute ) half-life rapidly degrade vivo cytidine deaminase . However , coadministration tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) , inhibitor cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase , show increase AUC parent compound 4-fold . Increased FdCyd exposure allow take intracellularly converted triphosphate , incorporate DNA inhibit action enzyme DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) . Inhibition DNMT , turn DNA methylation , result re-expression tumor suppressor gene . - Intravenous FdCyd THU evaluate Phase I clinical trial preliminary evidence activity . This trial investigate oral administration drug , show feasible expansion cohort previous trial . Objectives : - Establish safety tolerability oral FdCyd combination oral THU administer intermittent schedule 21-day cycle patient refractory solid tumor - Determine pharmacokinetics oral FdCyd oral THU - Document preliminary evidence activity oral FdCyd oral THU - Determine effect study treatment re-expression p16 select gene silence methylation circulate tumor cell tumor biopsy - Evaluate effect study treatment DNA ( cytosine-5 ) -methyltransferase 1 3 ( DNMT1 DNMT3 ) expression tumor biopsy Eligibility : -Adults histologically document solid tumor whose disease progress least one line standard therapy . Design : - This multicenter trial NCI coordinating center . - FdCyd THU administer intermittent schedule 21-day cycle . THU administer orally fix dose 3000 mg 30 minute prior FdCyd . - The trial follow standard Phase I dose escalation design ( 3-6 patient per cohort ) . - Consideration give increase day administration FdCyd THU target maximum plasma concentration FdCyd reach . - Blood urine pharmacokinetic study obtain patient . Blood pharmacodynamic study obtain achieve target Cmax 1microM . - Up 15 patient enrolled expansion cohort , mandatory pre- post-dose tumor biopsy collect assessment pharmacodynamic endpoint , dose level 8 ( 160 mg FdCyd+3000 mg THU 1x daily day 1-6 day week 1 , day 8-13 week 2 , 21-day cycle )</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document solid tumor whose disease progress standard therapy know associated survival advantage disease know standard therapy . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Diagnosis malignancy must confirm department pathology institution patient enrol prior patient enrollment . Patients must complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy , major surgery great equal 4 week prior enrollment ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug Phase 0 equivalent study , discretion Principal Investigator . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . Patients bone metastasis hypercalcemia IV bisphosphonate treatment prior study entry may continue treatment . Age great equal to18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use FdCyd THU patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &lt; TAB &gt; great equal 1,500/mcL platelet &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; TAB &gt; great equal 3 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; le 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; great equal 60 ML/min patient creatinine level &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; Above 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Because FdCyd show teratogenic animal , pregnant woman exclude trial . Nursing woman also exclude , unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FdCyd . Women childbearing potential must agree either abstain sexual intercourse use two form acceptable birth control , include one barrier method , 4 week prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Men must use latex condom every time sexual intercourse therapy 3 month study completion , even successful vasectomy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , partner inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients receive investigational agent . Ability swallow liquid . Willingness provide blood urine sample , biopsy sample expansion phase study , research purpose . For expansion cohort , patient must tumor amenable biospy ( excisional incision biopsy skin H &amp; N lesion visualization ) willingness undergo tumor biopsy patient undergoing procedure due medical necessity tissue may collect , tumor biopsy tissue previous research study medical care available submission registration . Criteria submission tissue : Tissue must collect within 3 month prior registration Patient receive intervening therapy cancer since collection tumor sample Tumor tissue must meet minimum requirement EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinically significant illness would compromise participation study , include , limited active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency , know HIV infection require protease inhibitor therapy , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 2 month treatment brain metastasis . Patients stable dos antiseizure medication . These patient may enrol discretion Principal Investigator . History allergic reaction attribute fluoropyrimidines ( e.g. , capecitabine , fluorouracil , fluorodeoxyuridine ) tetrahydrouridine . Malabsorption syndrome condition would interfere intestinal absorption .</criteria>
