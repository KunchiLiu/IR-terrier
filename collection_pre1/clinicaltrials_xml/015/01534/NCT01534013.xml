	<detailed_description>Background : Type 1 diabetes cause antibody attack insulin-producing β-cells pancreas . Treatment usually regular insulin injection , inform glucose measurement fingerprick blood sample . However , injection mimic normal behaviour β-cell lead suboptimal blood glucose control complication include kidney failure , blindness , nerve damage heart disease . Aggressive treatment help may lead potentially-dangerous low blood glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . Glucose control measure HbA1c ( normal range 4 6 % ) , measure amount haemoglobin expose glucose period around 3 month . Current regimens treat Type 1 diabetes clinical practice mainly base injection subcutaneous insulin several time daily dosage determine intermittent blood glucose measurement . The DCCT ( Diabetes Control Complications Trial ) demonstrate intensive management use principle reduce complication 50-76 % . This expense increase hypoglycaemia , especially HbA1c level &lt; 7.5 % . In study , intensive management result people spend 30 % day glucose value &gt; 10mM &gt; 2 hours/day hypoglycaemia , often night . A closed loop system provide potential improve HbA1c avoid hypoglycaemia . It require continuous glucose measurement , control device pump insulin delivery . The subject extensively review . Intelligent control device develop others , use principle feedback control predictive modelling . These initially cumbersome e.g . 'biostator ' recent system miniaturise capable achieve blood glucose control fast state , provide input interstitial glucose level . They yet proven robust , may associate hypoglycaemia capable achieve adequate post-prandial control cop intercurrent illness outside hospital environment . This clinical trial protocol assess Imperial College close loop insulin delivery system . The closed loop insulin delivery comprise 3 main component : glucose sensor , control algorithm insulin delivery system . The glucose sensor use throughout clinical validation study CE mark , MHRA approve device manufacture Medtronic . It subcutaneous sensor sits skin sample interstitial fluid use enzyme electrode . A small voltage apply across sensor current feed back sensor instrumentation . This current proportional glucose concentration interstitial fluid calibrate blood glucose minimum 12 hourly . The control algorithm derive physiological experiment carry group demonstrate beta cell pancreas produce insulin people without diabetes . Utilising data experiment possible implement behaviour beta cell software use simulator 200 virtual patient demonstrate safety efficacy software . The data simulator attach application appendix . The simulator develop human data take account sensor error , sensor placement , route insulin administration meal-time glucose absorption . It approve FDA United States step pathway develop artificial pancreas validate human data . In clinical validation device control algorithm implement print circuit board use programmable micro-controller . The insulin pump device use throughout clinical validation Roche Accu-Check Combo Spirit . This CE mark MHRA approve device supply Roche capability direct communication motor verify pump software command license use communication protocol research purpose . This ensure safe communication control algorithm pump provide fail-safe ensure pump motor respond appropriately control algorithm . Clinical validation close loop insulin delivery device follow path incremental challenge algorithm hardware , start fast basal study advisory mode progress ambulatory , meal study full close loop . The aim trial ass safety efficacy close loop device apply technology participant type 1 diabetes variety scenario , start fast test progress overnight control , mealtime control , finally , ambulatory test . Brief outline 5 visit within trial period : - Visit 1 : Screening include clinical examination , fast blood test , completion diabetes quality life questionnaire , continuous glucose monitor attach subject - Visit 2 : Review continuous glucose monitoring result 5 day - Visit 3 : Short Duration Fasting Closed Loop ( 6 hour closed-loop assessment ) - Visit 4 : Long Duration/ Overnight Fasting Closed Loop Standard Meal Challenge ( 13 hour closed-loop assessment ) - Visit 5 : 24 Hour Ambulatory Automatic Closed Loop During visit 3-5 blood sample capillary glucose &amp; ketone , venous glucose insulin level take place every 15-30 minute closed-loop insulin delivery system run .</detailed_description>
