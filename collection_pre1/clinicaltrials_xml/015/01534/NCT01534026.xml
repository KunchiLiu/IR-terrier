	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( cardiomyopathy ) chronic condition heart fail function pump move blood around body . Aspirin traditionally use heart failure tendency towards blood clot ( include stroke heart attack , clot legs lung ) observe group aspirin 's mechanism action prevent blood clot . This important two-thirds case heart failure cause blood clot coronary artery result heart attack , aspirin give reduce chance heart attack . However aspirin introduced clinical trial investigator know run . Systematic review trial aspirin heart failure show use increase survival , evidence recommend routine use . Another important finding use aspirin may reduce beneficial effect ACE inhibitor mortality benefit , aspirin associate increase hospitalisation heart failure compare drug prevent clot placebo . The investigator propose use aspirin heart failure cause heart attack ( `` non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy '' ) unnecessary could stop . The importance find evidence cease unproven medication heart failure understate . Patients heart failure take average six prescription medication day . Each medication side effect interaction drug together unknown . Aspirin drug frequently side effect increase risk bleeding , gastrointestinal ulceration , well kidney impairment . In study , investigator plan withdraw aspirin patient stable non-ischaemic heart failure closely monitor environment watch effect heart failure .</brief_summary>
