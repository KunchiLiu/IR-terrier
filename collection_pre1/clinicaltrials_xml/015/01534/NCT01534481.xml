	<brief_summary>The Milk Trial seek determine effect neurodevelopmental outcomes age 22-26 month donor human milk compare preterm infant formula in-hospital diet infant whose mother choose provide breast milk able provide minimal amount . Infants randomize receive donor breast milk formula hospital stay . Infant 's followed reach 22-26 month age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Milk v . Formula Extremely Low Birth Weight ( ELBW ) Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong evidence maternal breast milk feeding infancy confer multiple health benefit extremely preterm population ( extremely low birth weight , ELBW , &lt; 1000 g ) . Studies suggest IQ advantage 8 point confer maternal milk feed population . Rates sepsis necrotizing enterocolitis also low human milk feed ELBW infant , experience shorter hospital stay few re-hospitalizations first year life . When mother choose unable provide milk , preterm formula usually use . Recently , pasteurize donor human milk available NICUs US alternative preterm formula . Donor milk well studied regard safety efficacy . It unknown donor human milk confers benefit maternal milk regard neurodevelopmental health outcome . The propose study first US multicenter randomize trial health developmental effect donor milk compare preterm formula ELBW infant receive little maternal milk . Our long-term goal optimize neurodevelopmental health outcome ELBW infant , maximize quality life societal functionality throughout life . If donor human milk similar effect maternal milk , public health benefit donor milk feeding ELBW infant unable receive maternal milk would considerable .</detailed_description>
