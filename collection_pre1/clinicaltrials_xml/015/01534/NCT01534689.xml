	<brief_title>Study Use Low Level Laser Light Therapy Treat Toenail Fungus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An infection toenail fungus , onychomycosis , occur fungi infect one nails . As nail fungus spread deep nail , may cause nail discoloration , thicken development crumbling edge , lead unsightly potentially painful problem . Onychomycosis difficult treat , infection recur easily . Toenail fungus affect approximately 23 million people US - 10 % adult . Currently available treatment toenail fungus lacking . Even effective oral medication successful half time . Topical medication successful less 10 % time . Recently , research find laser therapy show promise novel alternative treatment toenail onychomycosis . Unlike medication-driven treatment toenail fungus many side effect include serious one liver toxicity , laser therapy present minimal risk side effect . Laser therapy apply toenail onychomycosis shin laser light toenail . The laser light vaporize fungus leave skin surround tissue unharmed .</detailed_description>
