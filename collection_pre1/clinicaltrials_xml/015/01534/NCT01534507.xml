	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome , ( IBS ) common functional disorder gut quite disabling patient . The common symptom IBS abdominal pain discomfort along erratic change bowel habit diarrhoea , constipation mixture two ( refer IBS subtypes ) . Despite much research effort understand pathophysiology IBS ; yet specific biomarkers/definitive measurement identify use aid diagnosis reduce need unnecessary , unpleasant expensive test . Evidence show anxiety play part IBS speed transit time small bowel . In study , investigator hypothesise since anxiety common feature IBS , fast small bowel transit likely find subtypes IBS difference stool frequency consistency IBS subgroup therefore likely reflect difference colonic function . The investigator wish test measure small large bowel transit time use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) validate result MRI two method currently use clinical practice -The previously validate lactose-C13 Ureide breath test ( small bowel transit ) standard radio-opaque pellet method assess whole gut transit ( WGT ) time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Small Large Bowel Transit Tests Using MRI ( Study 1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator 2 main part study i.e . Study 1 Study 2 . As part study 1 , investigator would like recruit 5 healthy volunteer pilot study optimise measurement analysis Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test along MRI scanning regular interval . Following , investigator would like assess feasibility reproducibility use MRI image assess gastrointestinal transit . The investigator would like recruit 21 healthy volunteer measure orocaecal transit time ( OCTT ) whole gut transit ( WGT ) use conventional method Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test OCTT Metcalf method use standard radio-opaque pellet method WGT compare MRI imaging . Once analysed best method OCTT WGT decide , method would apply Study 2 . In study 2 , investigator would like recruit 30 healthy volunteer , 30 patient diarrhoea predominantly Irritable Bowel Syndrome , 30 patient constipation predominantly Irritable Bowel Syndrome 30 patient Mixed irritable Bowel Syndrome . The best method study 1 OCTT WGT apply assess gastrointestinal transit subject . Based first study , best method ass OCTT Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test WGT , best method MRI marker capsule . Participants need fill questionnaire assess stress level fill symptom questionnaire study day .</detailed_description>
