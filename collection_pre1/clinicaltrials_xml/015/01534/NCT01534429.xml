	<brief_summary>Increasing experience identify post-herniorraphy chronic pain under-recognized important complication . Nerve entrapment injury recognize cause pain . Operative treatment select patient condition include surgical exploration affect groin , identification removal involved nerve , removal meshoma . This procedure highly effective treatment chronic pain . This study attempt subjectively objectively evaluate patient 's chronic groin pain use quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) validate pain scale questionnaire . Quantitative sensory test method use assess damage small large nerve fiber . It use diagnose assess severity nerve damage , also help determine neuropathy respond treatment . QST use computer test system measure nerve react vibration change temperature . The procedure non-invasive patient feel minimal discomfort test . The hypothesis decrease subjective pain score would accompany improved QST result .</brief_summary>
