	<brief_summary>With current chemotherapy protocol , 60-80 % patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) leukemic blast bone marrow reduce &lt; 5 % . This call `` complete remission ( CR ) '' prerequisite cure disease . During last year , several genetic biologic risk factor achievement CR define , remission rate vary considerably patient group different risk profile . On one hand , patient certain chromosomal molecular aberration high CR rate approximately 90 % . Moreover , patient , molecularly target therapy specific genetic aberration currently evaluate clinical trial . However , genetic aberration account 50-60 % overall patient population AML . The remain patient significantly inferior CR rate 50-60 % 30 % resistant disease two cycle standard induction chemotherapy . In conclusion , need improve induction regimens large number adult patient AML . An improved CR rate patient population increase number patient eligible intensive consolidation allogeneic stem cell transplantation might thereby basis well overall outcome . However , clear evidence goal achieve currently available chemotherapy protocol . Clofarabine ( 2-chloro-2-fluoro-deoxy-9-D-arabinofuranosyladenine ) nucleoside analogon combine property fludarabine cladribine . Due lack neurological side effect , clofarabine could explore high dos nucleoside analogue show considerable antileukemic activity patient relapse refractory acute leukemias elderly AML patient alone combination cytarabine . In addition , combination clofarabine , cytarabine idarubicin produce promising result acceptable toxicity patient relapse refractory AML . Based initial study , need optimization clofarabine dose combination . The aim AMLSG 17-10 study therefore evaluate tolerability safety increase dos clofarabine combination idarubicin/cytarabine patient high risk AML define genetic molecular risk profile .</brief_summary>
