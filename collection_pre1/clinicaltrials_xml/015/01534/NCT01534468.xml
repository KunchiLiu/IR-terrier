	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response H7N7 Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza A viruses widely find nature infect wide variety bird mammal , include human . Some type influenza A virus likely spread animal human , researcher interested monitoring virus develop potential vaccine . H7N7 one type influenza A virus . In recent year , several H7N7 outbreak among human , development H7N7 vaccine high priority . This study enroll two group participant : people previously receive one three type pandemic LAIV part research study people previously receive LAIV vaccine . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity single dose inactivate H7N7 vaccine two group participant . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , vital sign measurement , blood collection , nasal secretion collection . Female participant provide urine sample pregnancy test . All participant receive one intramuscular ( IM ) injection H7N7 study vaccine upper arm . They remain clinic 30 minute observation monitoring . Participants monitor record adverse symptom study visit . Additional study visit occur Days 4 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 , 180 . At select study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , nasal secretion collection . Blood collection occur visit ; blood sample may store future research .</detailed_description>
