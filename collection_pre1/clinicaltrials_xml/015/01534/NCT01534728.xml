	<brief_summary>Nearly 175 million people worldwide infect Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , close 3 % global population . Contrary chronic infection HIV , clearance HCV possible . While much know response treatment chronic HCV patient , fact acute HCV infection typically asymptomatic ( ~80 % patient show clinical sign ) make challenge define mechanism involve spontaneous clearance . Immune protection HCV think largely dependent upon CD8 T cell response . Therefore use late T cell detection technology investigator develop panel tetramers specific potential HCV epitope . To produce tetramers investigator utilize HLA ligand exchange technology allow production large collection peptide-HLA multimers T cell stain . The investigator already perform large scale identification HCVg1 HCVg4 CD8 T cell epitope use publish viral sequence algorithm prediction database . Using information investigator currently process develop collection peptide-HLA multimers T cell stain . Therefore investigator require large lymphocyte pool HCV+ patient test sensitivity accuracy tetramer CD3+CD8+ T cell . The investigator wish examine cell patient infected HCV g1 HCV g4 able test compare frequency possible conserve epitope present HCVg1 HCVg4 infection . Once developed technique allow u examine virus-specific CD8 T cell present patient acute chronic disease , small quantity blood . The development technology also allow u tailor future diagnostic test local population viral subspecies prevalent ; example use North-African HLA allele HCVg4 epitope . The work carry use assay provide important immunological correlate viral clearance impact vaccine design HCV infection . Finally , identification protective CD8 T cell specific HCV may allow new diagnostic tool predictive power disease progression use flow cytometer machine .</brief_summary>
