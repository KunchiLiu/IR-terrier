	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Radiotherapy Alone Versus CCRT With Temozolomide Grade III Gliomas Without 1p/19q Codeletion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role chemotherapy glioma recently reappraise advent temozolomide , especially glioblastomas , investigation direct unveiling optimal indication , dose protocol , relevant prognostic factor . Meanwhile , management anaplastic glioma WHO grade 3 ( anaplastic astrocytomas , anaplastic oligodendrogliomas , anaplastic oligoastrocytomas ) currently largely base surgery follow radiotherapy , prognosis remains still dismal median survival 2-5 year . To date , benefit chemo WHO grade 3 glioma unclear modest best conventional cytotoxic agent , role temozolomide entity still elucidate . Moreover , WHO grade 3 glioma know consist heterogeneous group different histologic feature , biological behavior , prognosis . Accordingly , relevant molecular marker appreciate grow body data show implication response therapy survival , include codeletion chromosome 1p/19q , methylation status methylguanine methyl transferase ( MGMT ) , isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) mutation.1,4-6,11 Among , codeletion chromosome 1p/19q consider important marker prognostic significance WHO grade 3 glioma . One recent Korean prospective cohort study show potential survival benefit safety concurrent chemoradiotherapy temozolomide follow adjuvant temozolomide WHO grade 3 glioma . In study , however , role molecular marker codeletion chromosome 1p/19q MGMT methylation could determine small number patient available . These result prompt Korean group project randomize phase 2 screen trial examine efficacy concurrent chemoradiotherapy temozolomide follow adjuvant temozolomide WHO grade 3 glioma without codeletion chromosome 1p/19q . The basic concept present clinical trial `` subgroup expect bad prognosis accord status chromosome 1p/19q , i.e . one without codeletion chromosome 1p/19q manage aggressively '' , investigate role temozolomide . An aggressive therapy ( surgery + concurrent chemoradiotherapy temozolomide follow adjuvant temozolomide ) compare conventional arm ( surgery + radiotherapy ) term efficacy safety WHO grade 3 glioma without chromosome 1p/19q codeletion . The prognostic significance methylation status MGMT IDH1 mutation molecular marker also assess arm key secondary analysis . Until , trial examine efficacy safety temozolomide WHO grade 3 glioma base prospective molecular stratification .</detailed_description>
