	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness place numbing medication around cervix prior perform laparoscopic gynecologic surgery decrease pain surgery . The study focus laparoscopic hysterectomy robotic-assisted myomectomies . It ass whether patient receive medication experience less pain require less pain medication post operatively help reduce number patient require hospitalization pain control follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Paracervical Block Post Operative Pain Laparoscopic Gynecologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A variety traditionally open surgical procedure recently become minimally invasive use laparoscopic technology . Gynecologic surgeries exception . However , gynecologic laparoscopic procedure associate significant post-operative pain , necessitate prolonged hospitalization , use post-operative opioids , case , development chronic post-operative pain . Prolonged hospitalization use opioids pose important patient safety concern , increase risk hospital borne illnesses medication error ; addition , opioids may cause respiratory depression addiction . Given rise cost health care also economic incentive eliminate need hospital admission due post-operative pain . Preemptive analgesia involve nerve blockade administration pain medication systemically prior incision reduce post-procedure pain . Paracervical blockade form preemptive analgesia . Paracervical block demonstrate safe effective obstetrical procedure reduce post-operative pain since 1970s . Recently also show efficacious reduce post-operative pain vaginal hysterectomy ( Long et al , Int Urogynecol J ( 2009 ) 20:5â€”10 ) . For present investigation , intend study effectiveness paracervical blockade laparoscopic robotic-assisted laparoscopic gynecological surgery . We hypothesize paracervical blockade prior surgical incision lessen level post-operative pain , reduce use opioids , decrease number patient require hospitalization pain control . We also hypothesize effect may longer last immediate post-operative period may decrease amount time return normal activity surgery . Using anecdotal evidence primary investigator , Dr. Ascher-Walsh rate hospitalization laparoscopic hysterectomy ( laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy , total laparoscopic hysterectomy , laparoscopic assist supracervical hysterectomy ) approximately 67 % . In study , wish decrease hospitalization paracervical block 50 % , thus obtain overall post-operative hospitalization rate 33 % . For robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy , rate hospitalization 50 % . We wish decrease 50 % well . Overall aim achieve rate 30 % post-operative hospitalization pain control laparoscopic hysterectomy robotic myomectomies combine .</detailed_description>
