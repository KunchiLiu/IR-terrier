	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested study role gene play drug alcohol addiction . Genes seem account half difference people become addicted drug people . This study collect blood skin cell sample . These cell use develop stem cell useful study gene relate drug use dependence . Objectives : - To study genetic cellular difference people addict drug . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 65 year age use drug . - Individuals 21 65 year age treatment buprenorphine methadone . Design : - Participants screen brief physical exam medical history . - Participants also answer question physical mental health , quality life , history drug alcohol use . A urine sample cheek swab sample collect . - Participants whose genetic sample match study requirement ask come back provide skin biopsy sample second urine sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - The molecular- cellular-based mechanism contribute initiation development addiction remain elucidated . Estimates suggest 40-60 percent vulnerability addiction may attributable genetic aberration . Multiple chromosomal region link addiction include contain dopamine transporter ( DAT ) vesicular monoamine transporter ( VMAT2 ) gene . Current effort understand polymorphism monoamine transporter contribute molecular mechanism addiction severely hinder inability directly interrogate neural cell type patient . There great potential patient-specific iPS cell technology profoundly impact understand human development disease provide genetically distinct , functional source human cell . Objective - The objective research develop cell-based system whereby neural cell afflict individual functionally assay interrogate molecular mechanism underlie addiction . Study population Controls ( non-drug user ) opioid dependent adult receive opioid agonist therapy age 21- 65 enrol . Design Participants demographic characteristic , psychosocial evaluation , psychiatric , medical , drug use history characterize . DNA collect via cheek swab 30 potential participant determination dopamine transporter ( DAT ) vesicular monoamine transporter ( VMAT2 ) gene polymorphism . Participants ( N=16 ) suitable polymorphism ask go skin biopsy ; 2 individual two genotype gene ( DAT VMAT ) , i.e. , 8 sample addict 8 sample control subject . Collaborators Case Western Reserve University use skin cell derive characterize patient-specific , induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell carry monoamine transporter polymorphism hDAT1 hVMAT2 gene . They differentiate patient-specific iPS cell line dopaminergic neuron carry detailed functional characterization cell identify molecular characteristic . Outcome measure - Biological specimen addiction patient control use derive characterize patient-specific , induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell carry monoamine transporter polymorphism . Patient-specific iPS cell line differentiate dopaminergic neuron . In follow study , characterize , compare , functionally assay patient-specific , iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neuron control addiction patient carry polymorphisms hDAT1 hVMAT2 gene investigate possible association dopamine neurotransmission variation vulnerability addiction .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . 21 65 year old Opioid dependent participant group : 2. enrollment substance abuse treatment protocol Archway . Nondrug user 3. lifetime history drug dependence indicate screen ASI Substance Abuse/Dependence Evaluation counselor interview . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Relevant neurological disorder ( include , limited , Parkinson disease Huntington disease ) . 2. contraindication skin biopsy include , limited , bleed disorder , skin disorder , immune disorder , MAI determine may alter risk biopsy . 3. cognitive impairment severe enough preclude informed consent valid response questionnaire . 4. control also exclude test positive drug alcohol screen study visit . 5. unwillingness allow sample keep future research .</criteria>
