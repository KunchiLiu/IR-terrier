	<brief_summary>Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion treat Aptus Heli-FX EndoAnchor System conjunction commercially available non-Aptus Endografts divide , appropriate , two group . 1 . Primary Group- Subjects undergoing initial ( primary ) endovascular repair AAA investigator believe proximal aortic neck challenge risk failure fixation and/or seal great enough use Heli-FX EndoAnchor System warrant . 2 . Revision Group- Those subject previously undergone EVAR procedure investigator believe use Heli-FX EndoAnchor System warrant A- Treat exist graft migration and/or type 1a endoleak , without concurrent use device . B- Treat subject believe risk migration and/or Type 1a endoleak Subjects must sign ICF prior obtain study specific information . Subjects eligible consented 30 day post-procedure . Enrolled subject follow per local 'standard care ' 5 year post procedure . Study recommend follow-up per SVS ESVS guidance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Arms : Abdominal Arm : Subjects abdominal aortic aneurysm require placement EndoAnchors™ level renal artery consider part abdominal arm . If renal artery visceral artery require ( ) chimney procedure ( ) , subject consider part Advanced Disease arm . Thoracic Arm : Subjects thoracic aortic aneurysm require placement EndoAnchors proximal leave common carotid artery ( LCCA ) distal celiac artery . Thoracic procedures require arch vessel transposition ( ) bypass procedure LCCA brachiocephalic artery , chimney procedure arch visceral artery ( ) , hybrid open-endovascular repair aorta consider part Advanced Disease Arm . Advanced Disease Arm : To collect data consecutively treat patient , Advanced Disease Arm comprise subject require placement EndoAnchors proximal LCCA visceral segment aorta distal celiac artery proximal renal artery . Subjects thoracic procedure require arch vessel transposition ( ) bypass ( except leave subclavian artery ) hybrid open-endovascular procedure well abdominal thoracic procedure require chimney procedure renal visceral artery also include Advanced Disease arm . Primary Group : Assess Aptus HeliFX Aortic Securement System place time initial endograft implantation , either prevent endograft migration Type Ia endoleak , treat Type Ia endoleak evident time implantation . Revision Group : Assess Aptus HeliFX™ Aortic Securement System subject previously implant commercial endografts , prevention graft migration treatment Type Ia endoleak .</detailed_description>
