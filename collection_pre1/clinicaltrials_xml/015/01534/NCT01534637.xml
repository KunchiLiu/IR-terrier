	<brief_title>Aprepitant Preventing Nausea Vomiting Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Discern gastrointestinal toxicity associate 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) /Gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) chemotherapy combine upper abdominal radiation therapy . II . Determine addition prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy standard chemoradiation patient pancreatic cancer result less nausea vomiting compare historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine impact prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy impact emesis daily living , measure use MASCC Antiemesis ( MAT ) tool . OUTLINE : CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients undergo radiation therapy daily day 1-5 5.5 week . Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute weekly either fluorouracil IV continuously capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily day 1-5 . PROPHYLACTIC THERAPY : Beginning 1 hour chemoradiotherapy , patient receive aprepitant PO day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 7 day 5.5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Two four week completion chemoradiotherapy prophylactic therapy , patient without disease progression decline performance status receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
