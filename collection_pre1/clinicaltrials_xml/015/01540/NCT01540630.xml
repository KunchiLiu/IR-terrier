	<brief_summary>This double-blind , randomize withdrawal study compare CNV1014802 placebo patient trigeminal neuralgia successfully respond CNV1014802 initial open-label phase . Patients participate initial open-label treatment period 21 day CNV1014802 150mg three time day ( tid ) . Responders randomize 28 day CNV1014802 150mg tid placebo . Following interim analysis 10 evaluable patient complete open-label phase , dose regimen may increase 350mg twice day ( bid ) remainder trial responder rate le 60 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IIa Withdrawal Study CNV1014802 Patients With Trigeminal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order randomise enter double-blind placebo control phase study , patient must satisfy least one follow criterion : - 30 % decrease number paroxysm ( either spontaneous , evoked , ) - 30 % reduction severity pain experience paroxysm ( either spontaneous , evoke ) - A Patient Global Improvement Change rating much improved/very much improve The response compare baseline recording pain make 7 day run-in period . If patient meet one criterion term responder , eligible randomize double-blind treatment phase . During double-blind randomised phase , patient evaluate determine meet failure criterion clinic visit occur every 7 day double-blind treatment period . The number failures CNV1014802 versus number failure placebo double-blind treatment period primary outcome study . Patients classify treatment failure meet one follow criterion : - 50 % increase frequency paroxysm compare final 7 day open-label period - 50 % increase severity pain experienced paroxysm compare final 7 day open-label period - A Patient Global Improvement Change rating much worse/very much bad - The patient discontinues study due 'Lack Efficacy ' - The patient discontinues due adverse reaction poor tolerability consider related study medication</detailed_description>
