	<brief_summary>Malaria remain major concern US military . During World War II , malaria lead cause disease non-battle injury 500-700 men infect per day , result 24,000 malaria-related casualty . ( 10 ) Currently , method use protect troop malaria insecticidal net , clothing , antimalarial treatment . To effective , method must self-administered use consistently , often unattainable field combat situation . The United States Army Medical Research Development Command ( USAMRMC ) , United States Army Medical Materiel Development Activity ( USAMMDA ) Walter Reed Army Institute Research ( WRAIR ) actively pursue development effective vaccine P. falciparum malaria ; development vaccine high priority US military individual travel endemic region , equally important population reside area . A Phase 1 study use FMP012 , recombinant E.coli express malaria protein ( CelTOS ) vaccine 1. assess safety reactogenicity candidate P. falciparum malaria vaccine FMP012/GLA-SE Secondary : 2. measure humoral immune response FMP012/GLA-SE use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) 3. assess protective efficacy FMP012/GLA-SE P. falciparum sporozoite challenge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single center , non-randomized , open label , dose escalation Phase 1study sporozoite challenge . The antigen FMP012 adjuvanted Glucopyranosyl lipd A stable emulsion ( GLA-SE ) , proprietary adjuvant produce Infectious Disease Research Institute ( IDRI ) . This first-in-human study FMP012 . Thirty subject , divide 3 group ( 10 subject per group ) , receive 3 dos FMP012/GLA-SE vaccine . Group 1 receive 10 µg FMP012 formulate 2 µg GLA-SE adjuvant Group 2 receive 10 µg FMP012 formulate 5 µg GLA-SE adjuvant . Group 3 receive 50 µg FMP012 formulate either 5 µg GLA-SE adjuvant ( Group 3a ) 2 µg GLA-SE adjuvant ( Group 3b ) . Determination whether proceed Group 3a Group 3b make principal investigator ( PI ) independent medical monitor second vaccination dose Group 2 complete , base predefined safety group hold criterion protocol . There staggered start Group 1 Group 2 separate minimum 14 day . Group 3a Group 3b start vaccination 2 week second vaccination Group 2 . The first second vaccination dos group separate 28 day group receive third vaccination dose day . The second third vaccination dos Group 1 separate 84 day , Group 2 70 day , Group 3 28 day . Six non-immunized infectivity control subject enrol prior challenge phase . All subject Vaccination Group Infectivity Control Group participate primary malaria sporozoite challenge require stay hotel evaluation maximum 10 night start 9 day challenge . A directly monitor , sequentially allocate , open-label oral regimen chloroquine artemether/lumefantrine administer parasitemic subject .</detailed_description>
