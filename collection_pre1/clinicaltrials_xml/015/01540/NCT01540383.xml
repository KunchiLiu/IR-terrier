	<brief_title>Effectiveness Intensive Aphasia Therapy Under Routine Clinical Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims study : This multicenter randomize placebo-controlled study aim examine whether integrative intensive ( &gt; 10 hours/week least 3 week ) language communication therapy administer routine clinical condition translate statistically significant functional improvement everyday communication patient chronic aphasia ( i.e. , aphasia persist 6 month stroke ) . A aim examine whether therapy-induced improvement still maintain period six month . The study 's result may lead targeted treatment regimen thus enhancement health-related quality life person chronic aphasia . The data provide evidence-based guideline best practice rehabilitation person chronic aphasia . Methods : Fourteen in- outpatient rehabilitation centre across Germany participate study . Via digital randomization procedure , patient allocate one two group : experimental group , start soon feasible treatment last 3 6 week , wait list control group , whose therapy begin three-week delay . Both group receive combination language systematic communicative-pragmatic language therapy . Everyday language ability examine standardized outcome measure , compare group several point : immediately well immediately 6 month completion ( 3-6 week ) intensive language therapy . Statistical analysis : The primary analysis compare change functional communication ability ( indicated change pre- post-therapy functional communication score primary outcome measure , ANELT ) experimental wait list control group intention-to-treat ( ITT ) design . To balance unequal treatment duration across patient ( `` naturalistic treatment set '' ) , critical pre- post therapy interval fix three week , option extension therapy ( provide grant sickness fund ) re-test termination therapy . The long-term stability potential treatment gain re-evaluated 6 month post therapy . Further exploratory analysis examine therapy-induced change secondary outcome measure ( see ) experimental compare wait list control group . Considering age , gender , time post stroke onset , aphasia type ( fluent , non-fluent ) , aphasia severity ( base Aachen Aphasia Test [ AAT ] profile score ) , total hour therapy provide , type stroke ( cortical stroke without subcortical involvement ) , amount therapy-concomitant self-administered language practice ( e.g . computer-aided practice ) , concurrent physio- neuropsychological therapy might influence functional outcome , factor include multivariate analysis variable selection . The amount outpatient therapy provide discharge intensive treatment statistically control covariate analysis . Finally , investigator expect therapy effect wait list control group comparable experimental group . Thus , initiation therapy control group three-week delay , outcome data collect analogy experimental group , serve replicate potential effect intensive language therapy routine clinical condition .</detailed_description>
