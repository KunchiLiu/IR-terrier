	<brief_title>PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 Docetaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor That Locally Advanced , Can Be Removed By Surgery , Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity identify recommend phase II dose combination docetaxel BKM 120 ( P13K inhibitor BKM120 ) patient advance solid tumor . II . To determine safety tolerability combination . III . To determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interaction BKM12O docetaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary evidence efficacy combination patient advance cancer . II . To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation predictive biomarkers efficacy combination . III . To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms polymorphism BKM120 transport metabolism predictor toxicity and/or efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 . Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
