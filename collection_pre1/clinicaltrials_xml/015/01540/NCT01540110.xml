	<brief_summary>Primary The purpose study evaluate tumour pathological complete response rate six cycle neoadjuvant docetaxel cyclophosphamide Asian population . Secondary To assess : 1 . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacogenomics ( PG ) docetaxel cyclophosphamide Asian patient , 2 . Safety toxicity docetaxel cyclophosphamide Asian patient , 3 . To determine efficacy short course ( 3 day ) filgrastim primary secondary prophylaxis febrile neutropenia patient receive docetaxel cyclophosphamide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Duration Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design use trial . With null hypothesis p0=5 % alternative hypothesis p1=20 % , significance level , α=5 % power , ( 1-β ) =90 % , total 41 patient require , 21 patient recruit first stage . Hence , 21 41 patient recruited National Cancer Centre Singapore 36 month Patient Sample Patients newly diagnose , histological confirm HER-2 negative clinically node positive locally advanced ( cT3-T4 , N0-3 cTx , T0-4 , N2-N3 ) primary breast cancer without evidence metastatic disease . Dosage/ Dosage Form , Route Dose Regimen Node Positive Locally Advanced HER2 Negative Breast Cancer proceed Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 + Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 q21 day x 6 proceed surgery NOTE : cyclophosphamide administer intravenous infusion 10 minute follow docetaxel 90 minute Patients receive chemotherapy , radiotherapy , endocrine therapy target therapy per institutional guideline surgery . Patients clinical non-response 4 cycle docetaxel cyclophosphamide unlikely pathological complete response . Hence , discontinuation study cross anthracycline base chemotherapy allow point discretion treat oncologist . These patient classify pathological non complete response . Patients progressive disease time discontinue study treatment receive salvage therapy . Efficacy Measurements Pathological response assess evaluation resect surgical specimen completion protocol treatment . Safety Measurements Vital sign , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status , adverse event ( AEs ) , serial laboratory safety test . Proportion patient febrile neutropenia despite primary prophylactic G-CSF review 6,12 ,18 , 24 30 patient accrue . Increase number dos primary prophylactic G-CSF implement low limit 95 % confidence interval proportion exceed 20 % . Data Analysis All patient receive least 1 dose study treatment include safety efficacy analysis . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , Pharmacogenetic ( PG ) Correlative Studies Consent obtain future analysis store preoperative tumour biopsy specimens possible gene expression profile predictive docetaxel cyclophosphamide . Patients undergo blood sample docetaxel cyclophosphamide PK study cycle 1 day 1 ( see page 22 detailed timing ) . Whole blood collect baseline genotyping CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 , ALDH , GST , ABCB1 , SLCO1B3 , PXR , CAR , HNF4α gene ALL PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS MUST BE FOLLOWED UP FOR OUTCOME .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer . Patients must either locally advanced ( cT3T4 , N03 cTx , T04 , N2N3 ) lymph node positive breast cancer Age &gt; 21 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use docetaxel patient &lt; 21 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial . Life expectancy great 10 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect docetaxel develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . HER2 positive breast cancer Metastatic breast cancer Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy prior enter study . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel , cyclophosphamide , lenograstim filgrastim . History preexist peripheral neuropathy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy general include docetaxel cyclophosphamide use study pregnancy class D agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treated chemotherapy . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction chemotherapy agent administer study . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients prior malignancy exclude except basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma insitu cervix receive curative treatment . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Protocol precaution restriction Patients pregnant actively breast feed eligible participate study state 3.2.8 . Female patient child bear potential require use reliable method contraception duration study 4 week last dose study treatment .</criteria>
