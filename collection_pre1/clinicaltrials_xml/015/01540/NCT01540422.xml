	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate improve vein graft patency rate 12 month endoscopically harvest saphenous vein graft . The study evaluate use modification exist technique vein graft handling harvest . A secondary aim develop standardized approach harvesting , handle , prepare vein graft endoscopic approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Improve Long Term Vein Graft Patency After Coronary Bypass Surgery Using Novel Endoscopic Harvesting Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Available data support two fact : 1 ) Saphenous vein graft failure rate may high 47 % per patient one year post coronary artery bypass grafting , 2 ) Endoscopic vein-graft harvest independently associate vein-graft failure adverse clinical outcome . Multiple factor may contribute low long term patency rate endoscopically harvest graft . Summarized , two major contribute factor theorize harvest technique vein trauma harvesting . With recognize disadvantage open vessel harvest include high incidence infection , long incision , great potential poor healing , long length hospital stay , reduce failure rate vein graft harvest endoscopically utmost importance . It hypothesis modification exist harvest technique improve vein graft patency endoscopic vein graft harvest patency rate comparable open vessel harvesting obtain . In prospective , multi-center non-randomized , observational study , 100 patient undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting . Eligible candidate undergo lone coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedures endoscopic vein graft harvest use best harvesting practice . As part routine postoperative care , patient prescribe dual-antiplatelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel . Compliance 3 month dual-antiplatelet therapy monitor . Vein graft patency evaluate : 1 . Intra-operatively transit time graft flow measurement . 2 . Post-operative Day 30 Cardiac CT Angiography . 3 . Post-operative Month 12 Cardiac CT Angiography .</detailed_description>
