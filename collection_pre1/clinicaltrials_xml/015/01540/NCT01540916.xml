	<brief_summary>Alterations acid-base equilibrium common critically ill patient . Thus , understand pathophysiology possible compensatory mechanism act different organ may play important role well set consequent clinical treatment . The lung kidney two principal actor regulation . Although respiratory response acid-base alteration well understood , less information available renal system concern . Such lack information partially due : 1 ) historical consideration kidney `` slow '' organ , response variation acid-base equilibrium ; 2 ) lack monitoring system closely assess renal response . Our group recently develop monitoring system aim analyze , quasi-continuous non-invasive manner ( every 10 min ) urinary profile term urinary pH electrolyte concentration ( sodium , potassium , chloride , ammonium ) . The investigator hypothesize renal system react large well minimal variation acid-base equilibrium ( especially induce variation respiratory function ) fast way , modify urinary concentration ( therefore urinary excretion ) ammonium electrolytes ( especially chloride ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Alterations Acid-base Equilibrium : Acute Chronic Renal Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim : To investigate acute renal response respiratory alteration acid-base equilibrium order well understand underlie physiological mechanism evaluate validity renal monitoring system indirectly assess effectiveness respiratory function . Secondary aim : To collect data chronic response renal system patient affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , well acute response acute variation chronic respiratory acidosis characterize patient affect COPD exacerbation . Study protol : Mechanically ventilate patient undergo control variation ventilatory setting ( hyperventilation vs. hypoventilation ) order induce control reduction increase arterial partial pressure carbon dioxide ( increase reduction arterial pH ) , within normal range pH ( 7.35 - 7.45 ) During variation , urinary concentration electrolytes pH monitor .</detailed_description>
