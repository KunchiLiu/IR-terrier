	<detailed_description>Controlled human malaria infection ( CHMI ) critical component malaria vaccine drug development important element strategy accelerate development new tool malaria control , elimination eradication . Until , CHMI perform malaria naïve subject country endemic malaria use infectious mosquito recently , aseptic , purified , cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite ( PfSPZ ) . Results study report significant infection success study subject excellent safety profile . The conduct CHMI study malaria endemic population allow early understanding response new vaccine drug endemic country population direct comparison previously expose non-exposed individual . Performing CHMI study malaria endemic country reduce associate cost , speed-up process test substantially contribute acceleration malaria vaccine drug research development process . This study conduct Bagamoyo , Tanzania , aim see whether people endemic country minimal previous history malaria suitable CHMI use PfSPZ Challenge . This study also assess whether success rate experiment improve lowering volume injection increase number inoculation . Hence , study contribute towards improvement CHMI study use syringe needle inoculation sporozoite .</detailed_description>
