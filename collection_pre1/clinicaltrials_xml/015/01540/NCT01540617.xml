	<brief_summary>Low back pain ( LBP ) well know health problem Western society significantly responsible socio-economic problem like absenteeism disability . The lifetime prevalence LBP 60-80 % approximately 85 % LBP `` non-specific '' character whereby underlying cause risk factor demonstrate . While many people recover within month , individual recurrence within year severe symptom . This might due insufficient knowledge underlie mechanism . Impaired proprioception , ability discern body/limb position movement , may cause maintain LBP show altered postural control strategy . Specifically , patient LBP rely proprioceptive signal ankle due less reliable proprioceptive input proximal segment . Moreover , show decreased variability postural control less postural robustness , variability prerequisite optimal function biological system . However , clarification neural correlate necessary . Deficits proprioception , find subgroup patient LBP , associate decreased ability brain process proprioceptive input . The aim project clarify central change individual recurrent non-specific low back pain healthy control . To evaluate central change MRI technique ( 3DTFE , DTI RS-fMRI ) use . In addition , association central change postural control task evaluate .</brief_summary>
