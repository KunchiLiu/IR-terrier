	<brief_summary>During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation spinal cord injure men increase pressure observed external urethral sphincter along increase bladder capacity . In subsequent study demonstrate Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve Stimulation ( TMNS ) woman could induce pressure increment external urethral sphincter . A pilot study since show 6 week stimulation 24 33 woman suffer urinary stress incontinence able contract pelvic floor muscle become free symptom . Another pilot study show promising effect overactive bladder syndrome . Furthermore pilot study men incontinent radical prostatectomy show promising result . A randomized investigation TMNS apply immediate period radical prostatectomy investigate effect continence erectile function go . The present study aim treat urinary incontinence men still incontinent 1 year radical prostatectomy . A medical vibrator use daily period 6 week result treatment evaluate . The participant randomize 2 group . Group 1 start vibration treatment base line group 2 start 6 week group 1 do . The group compare baseline , 6 week 12 week . The stimulation perform frenulum glans penis every day 6 week amplitude 2 mm frequency 100 Hz . Results evaluate basis questionnaire , micturition diary diaper test . If investigator able demonstrate significant reduction incontinence symptom subject investigator asses vibration way reestablish normal continence men radical prostatectomy .</brief_summary>
