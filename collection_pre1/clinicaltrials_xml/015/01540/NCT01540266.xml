	<detailed_description>RATIONALE However essential transfer information discharge might , positive effect patient recall content discharge . Little known patient ' ability subsequently recall instruction receive hospital discharge ( Sanderson , Thompson , Brown , Tucker , &amp; Bittner , 2009 ) . Using telephone interview gauge ability recall discharge instruction , Sanderson et al . ( 2009 ) find many patient unable even name diagnosis list risk factor contribute cause . Examining elderly patient ' comprehension discharge instruction , study find 21 % understand diagnosis , 56 % fail comprehend return instruction ( Hastings et al. , 2011 ) . A study Chau et al . ( 2011 ) show even immune-compromised patient 's knowledge oral drug discharge merely moderate . Finally , Isaacman et al . ( 1992 ) observe less half important discharge information , include medication detail indicator worsen patient 's clinical status , recall exit interview . These available finding suggest ample room discharge communication optimize find test technique . As psychological theory associate empirical finding suggest information structure powerful tool improve memory recall understanding , question raise whether structure information convey discharge communication could also improve patient ' memory respective content . Few researcher ( Doak , Doak , Friedell , &amp; Meade , 1998 ; Ley , 1979 ) suggest structure communication clinical setting could improve patient ' recall . They argue structure information would easier recall nonstructured information ; however , author provide strong evidence support hypothesis . Furthermore , structure approach tool may provide support physician increase communication competence potential solution improve quality communication prevent subsequent patient harm . To date , attempt make investigate whether convey information structure way result well outcomes , measure term learn recall . The power information structuring associate chunk mechanism primarily study laboratory ; previous study investigate role improve discharge information delivery . Could information structure also improve patient ' recall understand discharge information ? If , physicians best structure information discharge achieve goal ? How possible effect patient ' recall translate well adherence recommendation ? Studying question experimentally Emergency Department ( ED ) would demand potentially stressful ED patient . In first step , therefore decide take advantage student proxy patient . Various previous study use proxy ( mostly health care professional family caregiver ) evaluate certain patient outcome ( health-related quality life ( Pickard &amp; Knight , 2005 ) , functional ability ( Loewenstein et al. , 2001 ) , symptom ( Nekolaichuk et al. , 1999 ) ) . To knowledge previous study use student proxy gauge recall performance patient . Prior knowledge facilitates process new incoming information provide structure new information integrate ( Brod , Werkle-Bergner , &amp; Shing , 2013 ) ; therefore , structure incoming information recall well nonstructured information individual build upon prior knowledge . If , contrast , internal structure absent prior knowledge , externally impose structure could yield similar benefit . Thus , extent possible superiority structure presentation ED discharge information nonstructured presentation relate relevant prior medical knowledge secondary goal study . Or , word , could availability relevant prior knowledge enable receiver information store efficiently , even presentation lack structure ? To answer question , recruit , besides first-year psychology student , two additional independent population , namely first-year medical student third-year medical student . Specifically , three participant group differ notably knowledge cardiac pain ( first-year psychology student &lt; first-year medical student &lt; third-year medical student ) . TRIAL OBJECTIBVES Primary objective First , assume externally impose structure yield benefit term memory performance internal structure unavailable , goal study investigate whether first-year psychology student , i.e . student little prior medical knowledge , serve surrogate patient , recall information present structured way compare nonstructured presentation . Second , assume structure benefit mostly individual make use previous knowledge build memory chunk well control experimental setup two parameter `` structure '' `` prior medical knowledge '' , set oppose various degree relevant prior medical knowledge structure nonstructured content presentation , respectively . Secondary objective 1 . To compare difference structure nonstructured condition term participant ' rating comprehensibility physician , structure dialogue , willingness recommend physician friends relative . 2 . To establish whether effect information structure number recall item independent influence student ' current mood level attention . TRIAL ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Number item recall , separately structure nonstructured condition well three participate group Secondary endpoint Visual analog scale ( VAS ) measure participant ' current mood , level attention ( test moderating effect student ' status ) , rating comprehensibility physician , structure dialogue , willingness recommend physician friends relative . TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODS Trial design Prospective cross-sectional multicenter trial Participating site University Mannheim , Germany University Basel , Switzerland Study schedule Participants We recruit student regular lecture University Basel , Switzerland , Mannheim , Germany . Psychology student receive course credit participation . Participants young 18 year include limited ability give inform consent . Study Procedure The study conduct two quiet auditorium Universities Basel ( first-year psychology student third year medical student ) , Mannheim ( first year medical student ) . We randomly divide participant structure nonstructured condition , respectively . At outset , give informed consent , participant condition instruct watch video physician-patient interaction , request take perspective patient . After , video displaying experience emergency physician orally present structured content patient show one group . A second video display emergency physician , present content , nonstructured manner , show group . We confront student blank piece paper , ask mark everything occur concern communication ( immediate recall ) . Informed student observe peer order inhibit take note . After , student condition confront multiple choice test construct order measure student ' medical knowledge , five VASs order ass secondary endpoint . Information demographic variable collect conclusion . Data Analysis Primary endpoint recall performance participant express number item remember discharge communication . In primary , un-adjusted analysis , difference recall performance two group receive structure nonstructured discharge information , three group different level medical knowledge , well interaction , analyze use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . In addition , analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , adjust two VAS measure concern student ' status , perform . Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test perform probe inter- intragroup difference medical knowledge first-year psychology student , first-year medical student , third-year medical student . A t-test analysis use compare difference structure non-structured condition term participant ' VAS rating comprehensibility physician , structure dialogue , willingness recommend physician friends relative . All test perform use significance level Î± = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
