	<brief_title>Veliparib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event associate treatment veliparib ( ABT-888 ) assess Active Version National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . To determine proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair gene ( e.g. , breast cancer [ BRCA ] 1 , Fanconi ) clinical characteristic , response , patient outcome ( PFS OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma AND carry germline mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 ( confirmation require via Myriad test report ) ; histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report All patient must measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 ; measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ; lesion must &gt; = 10 mm measure compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; = 20 mm measure chest xray ; lymph node must &gt; = 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI Patient must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST ; tumor within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy Patients receive one prior cytotoxic regimen must Gynecological Oncology Group ( GOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Patients receive two three prior cytotoxic regimen must GOG performance status 0 1 Recovery effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy Patients free active infection require antibiotic ( exception uncomplicated urinary tract infection [ UTI ] ) Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior registration ; continuation hormone replacement therapy permit Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include chemotherapy , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) agent immunologic agent , must discontinue least three week prior registration ; patient receive nitrosoureas mitomycin C must discontinue 6 week prior registration Any prior radiation therapy must discontinue least four week prior registration Prior therapy Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease contain carboplatin , cisplatin , another organoplatinum compound ; initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) agent extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment Patients allow receive , required receive , two additional cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent disease Patients allow receive , required receive , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) therapy management recurrent persistent disease ; patient allow receive , required receive , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) therapy part primary treatment regimen Patients platinumsensitive platinumresistant disease eligible ; patient platinumrefractory disease NOT eligible Definitions : Platinum sensitive ovarian cancer define patient respond platinumbased therapy ( complete partial ) progress/recur 6 month last platinum dose ( i.e. , platinumfree interval &gt; 6 month ) Platinum resistant ovarian cancer define patient respond platinumbased therapy ( complete partial ) progress/recur within 6 month last platinum dose ( i.e. , platinumfree interval = &lt; 6 month ) Platinum refractory ovarian cancer define patient progression disease receive platinumbased chemotherapy fail achieve least partial response platinumbased chemotherapy ( i.e. , best response platinumbased chemotherapy stable disease ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mcl Platelets great equal 100,000/mcl Creatinine less equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin le equal 1.5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5 x ULN Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information Patients childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior study entry practice effective form contraception Patients previous treatment veliparib ( ABT888 ) poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP ) inhibitor ( include olaparib ) ; note : Iniparib ( BSI201 ) inhibit PARP1 pharmacologically achievable concentration , therefore prior iniparib therapy allow Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer specific malignancy , exclude evidence malignancy present within last three year ;
