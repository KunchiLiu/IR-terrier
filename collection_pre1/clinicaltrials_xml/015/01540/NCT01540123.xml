	<brief_summary>Berry fruit widely recognise natural functional food product . They contain several different phytochemical potential modulate human health wellbeing . There however debate regard mechanism drive health promoting property . Despite wide health promote property fruit extract report literature , considerable interest past decade primarily focus role reduce risk factor associate cancer heart disease . Consequently , remain paucity actual scientific information role modulate brain function , mood , learn memory , decrement negative impact quality life . Fruit phytochemical source show mediate peripheral cerebral blood flow . However , modulation cerebral blood flow show berry yet . Cerebral blood flow must maintain ensure constant delivery oxygen glucose well removal waste product . The modulation cerebral blood flow via supplementation berry polyphenols could therefore potential way positively modulate human cognitive behavior . The link acute increase cerebral blood flow increase cognition currently little weak could give good platform long term behavioral health benefit via increased cerebral/peripheral blood flow decrease MAO-B activity . The aim study therefore investigate impact berry extract digital volume pulse , blood pressure cerebral blood flow .</brief_summary>
