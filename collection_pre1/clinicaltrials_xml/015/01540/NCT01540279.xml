	<brief_summary>Background : Poor wound heal development surgical site infection ( SSI ) continue occur remain significant cause disability among operated patient . In spite substantial advance understand epidemiology , pathogenesis prevention remain one common complication conventional abdominal surgery incidence literature 4 % 17 % . As known surgical suture potentiate development wound infection search ideal suture material , suitable purpose pursue surgeon decade . Hypothesis : In line in-vitro result investigator hypothesize use antibacterial skin suture triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces rate SSI open abdominal surgery Methods : To prevent microbial colonization suture material operative wound therefore prevent SSI , triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture material antibacterial activity test un-coated suture material skin closure open abdominal surgery 200 patient . The study plan single center , randomize control trial . After ethical approval patient consecutively enrol 2011 2012 Department Visceral Surgery , University Hospital Basel , Switzerland . The patient follow 30 day ( day 3,7 30 ) detect document wound complication . Wound complication classify accord Center Disease Control Prevention Standard guideline . Data collect rate SSI analyse group . Expected value propose project : If investigator confirm propose hypothesis study could promise feasible approach lower SSI open abdominal surgery might also use surgical field . By lower rate SSI investigator might offer new cost saving procedure surgical community .</brief_summary>
