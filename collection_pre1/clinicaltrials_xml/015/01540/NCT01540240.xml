	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare tolerance safety low-dose Zidovudine ( AZT ) contain regimen ( 200 mg BID ) standard dosage ( 300 mg BID ) HIV patient initiate first line antiretroviral therapy . The investigator expect low-dose regimen show improved tolerability safety compare standard dosage , significant reduction number patient experience new grade 1 4 anaemia increase anaemia grade first 6 month treatment . The secondary objective study compare efficacy two dose regimen , measure classical clinical biological marker : number new AIDS defining illness , mortality rate , proportion patient achieve virological success mean CD4 cell count increase baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Reduced Dose Zidovudine ( AZT ) Compared With Standard Dose AZT Antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Existing formulation adult include zidovudine 100mg capsule , zidovudine/3TC 300/150mg , zidovudine/3TC/NVP 300/150/200mg , zidovudine/3TC/ABC 300/150/300 . Currently , international guideline recommend daily dose 600 mg 2 divided dos . Pharmacokinetic study zidovudine show twice daily regimen result high predose zidovudine-triphosphates ( TP ) concentration , active intracellular metabolite , compare daily dose give daily . Further , small study Thailand study find dos zidovudine 200 mg twice daily achieve plasma level equivalent standard international 300 mg twice daily dose individual weigh less 60 kg . The clinical efficacy zidovudine evaluate randomized clinical trial use range dose 300 1500 mg/day . In early trial ( Nordic Medical Research Councils ' HIV Therapy Group 1992 ) compare different dose zidovudine monotherapy advance HIV infection find difference death rate , new AIDS defining event . The incidence anaemia leucopenia compare 400 mg 1200 mg daily show direct dose relationship : 4 % 24 % ( anaemia ) 3 % 22 % ( leucopenia ) respectively . Another early trial ( Fischl 1990 ) demonstrate improved survival lower dose zidovudine ( 63 % ) versus high dose ( 52 % ) , significantly anaemia neutropenia high dose zidovudine arm ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . High dos zidovudine lead increased incidence anaemia neutropenia , impairment treatment efficacy measure CD4 cell count , HIV RNA level clinical progression . In context new recommendation favour use zidovudine stavudine first line treatment resource limit setting , investigator aim evaluate impact reduce zidovudine ( 200 mg BID ) treatment . API ( active product ingredient ) production cost important determinant antiretroviral drug price among generic manufacturer . A give percentage reduction dosage thus translate virtually equivalent percentage drug pricing . As cART continue expand Least Developed Countries , predict around 1.5 million people take zidovudine-based regimen 2010 . Small reduction annual per-patient cost AZT-based regimen could lead significant reduction global cost HIV treatment : estimate 47 million US dollar save 9 million patient treated 2014 . The present study prospective , randomise , 48 week , phase II trial . Subjects recruit one site : HIV outpatient clinic Internal Medicine Department , CNPS Hospital , Yaoundé , Cameroun . Randomisation perform initiation ART . Patients randomise one follow treatment arm , combination lamivudine NNRTI regimen : low-dose AZT arm ( 200 mg twice daily ) standard-dose AZT arm ( 300 mg twice daily ) . The primary endpoint comparison proportion patient experience new grade 1 4 anaemia increase anaemia grade two dose AZT regimen first six month treatment . The secondary endpoint : - Mean haemoglobin concentration leukocyte count change , laboratory grade 3 4 adverse event rate lead switch another cART regimen . - Differences proportion patient achieve virological success ( VL &lt; 50 cop/ml ) two dose zidovudine regimen week 24 . - Difference proportion patient achieve virological success ( VL &lt; 400 cop/ml ) two dose zidovudine regimen week 24 . - Difference mean viral load decline two group week 4 8 - Difference mean CD4 cell count increase baseline two dose zidovudine regimen week 8 , 24 . - Difference proportion patient genotype mutation patient detectable viral load week 24 . - Number new AIDS defining illness , mortality rate , drop-out rate compare two group . Patients follow individually 24 week entire period experimental treatment . After follow-up period , patient include low dose AZT arm treat standard AZT dose . They keep routine follow-up CNPS hospital . For first 68 patient include ( half total cohort ) study , Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB , independently clinical investigator ) undergo interim analysis week 8 follow-up continue enrollment . In sample patient , efficacy two treatment group compare : excess 15 % virological treatment failure low-dose AZT arm consider significant . Virological treatment failure point define decline viral load baseline 8th week less 2log . An incidence 30 % patient experience new grade 1 4 anaemia increase anaemia grade first 6 month treatment expect standard AZT dose regimen . A reduction adverse event 10 % patient treat low dose regimen would consider clinically significant . Thus , 10 % LFU expect follow-up period , investigator calculate sample size 68 patient arm detect clinically significant difference two arm . The percentage patient experience new grade 1 4 anaemia increase anaemia grade compare treatment arm use difference proportion observe ( Chi2 test Fisher exact test ) . The method use compare efficacy safety indicator . Multivariate analysis use obtain adjusted estimate risk factor treatment failure clinically significant adverse event . Analysis treatment safety efficacy perform 'intention treat '' `` per protocol '' . An `` intention treat '' analysis include patient enrol study receive least one dose study medication randomly allocate . A `` per protocol '' analysis include patient enrol study receive least one dose study medication randomly allocate AND reach one protocol define treatment failure endpoint ( death , lose follow-up , virological failure ) treatment randomly allocate complete trial follow-up treatment randomly allocate . Criteria termination trial : - Too low enrollment rate . - Unsafe unethical practice . - Following recommendation DSMB . The sponsor investigator ensure study conduct full compliance principle `` Declaration Helsinki '' law regulation country research conduct , whichever affords great protection individual . The study must fully adhere principle outline `` Guideline Good Clinical Practice '' ICH Tripartite Guideline ( E6 , June 1996 ) local law affords great protection subject . This study conduct accordance ethical principle lay Declaration Helsinki National Statement Ethical Conduct Research Involving Humans . Investigators obtain write informed consent subject participate study , adequate explanation aim , method , anticipated benefit , potential hazard study .</detailed_description>
