	<brief_summary>The main purpose study learn safety investigational drug , axitinib . An investigational drug drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available research use . Researchers also see change happen tumor take axitinib stop ( schedule break ) , change tumor may responsible growth . This do use special kind scan call 18F-FLT PET/CT . This scan consider investigational type scan use clinical care . These scan approve FDA , use study research purpose . In addition , investigator want find drug process distribute human body . The investigator also look different type cancer affect axitinib .</brief_summary>
