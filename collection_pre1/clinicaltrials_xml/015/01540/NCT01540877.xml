	<brief_summary>Main present study develop model concomitant C-fibre block sensitization elicit spontaneous pain well apply topical capsaicin local anesthetic ( LA ) examine sensory alteration combine C-fiber block sensitization different application order ( sensitization block C-fibers block sensitize C-fibers ) , compare mechanism alone . Thereby , expect strong sensory change combine substance application monoapplication . We expect also contralateral sensory alteration mirror change intervention site combine capsaicin LA application , strong sensitization alone absent C-fiber block alone .</brief_summary>
