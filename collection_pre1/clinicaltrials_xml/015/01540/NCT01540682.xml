	<brief_title>MLN8237 Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1b study MLN8237 , cetuximab definitive radiation therapy patient previously untreated locoregionally advanced HNSCC candidate definitive radiation therapy curative intent cetuximab radiosensitizer . The treatment regimen consist MLN8237 po bid 7 day follow 2 week 4 cycle first 3 cycle MLN8237 concurrent RT . Three dose level MLN8237 plan : 30 , 40 50 mg po bid . Cetuximab give FDA-approved load maintenance dos start ~ 1 week prior initiation radiation therapy continue grand total 12 week . Radiotherapy administer 2-Gy fraction , 5 day week , total dose ~70 Gy accord standard departmental protocol . Correlative biomarker assay pre- on-therapy biopsy specimen ( tissue micro array analyze AQUA quantitative immunofluorescence ) seek establish proof-of-mechanism determine novel drug combination predict effect biochemical signal pathway link Aurora A EGFR . Tumor sample also analyze Aurora A EGFR expression IHC FISH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female great 18 year age . 2 . ECOG performance status 01 3 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm HNSCC oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx , nasopharynx paranasal sinus consider multidisciplinary evaluation ( surgery , medical oncology &amp; radiation oncology ) appropriate definitive cetuximabbased radiation therapy 4 . No distant metastatic disease . Minimum workup include : History/physical examination within 4 week prior registration , include assessment weight weight loss past 6 month examination Medical Oncologist PET/CT scan within 6 week prior registration CT scan MRI head neck ( primary tumor neck node ) within 4 week prior registration 5 . Adequate organ marrow function 6 . Negative pregnancy test within 2 week prior registration woman childbearing potential . The effect MLN8237 develop human fetus unknown . For reason MLN8237 agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Male subject agree use acceptable method contraception entire study treatment period 4 month last dose MLN8237 . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . 1 . Systemic antineoplastic treatment within 21 day precede first dose MLN8237 . Patients treat noncytotoxic small molecule drug ( eg , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , erlotinib hormonal agent , letrozole ) must receive treatment drug least 2 week first dose MLN8237 administer . 2 . Patient already definitive surgical treatment , exclude diagnostic biopsy primary site nodal sample neck disease . Prior radical modify neck dissection also permit . 3 . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field . 4 . Primary tumor site skin salivary gland . 5 . Uncorrected CTCAE , v. 4.0 grade 34 electrolyte abnormality 6 . Patients may receive investigational agent treatment investigational product within 21 day first dose study drug . 7 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop rapid progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse event . 8 . History known allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition MLN8237 cetuximab . 9 . Patients may take proton pump inhibitor , H2 antagonists pancreatic enzyme replacement . Subjects refuse limit use alcohol also exclude . 10 . Severe , active comorbidity 11 . Clinical evidence intestinal malabsorption . Examples include resection pancreas upper small bowel , requirement pancreatic enzyme , condition would modify small bowel absorption oral medication . 12 . Prior treatment highdose chemotherapy , define chemotherapy require use peripheral blood bone marrow stem cell support hematopoietic reconstitution , include prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . 13 . Prior radiotherapy great equal 25 % bone marrow . Whole pelvic radiation consider 25 % . 14 . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . 15 . Major surgery within 14 day prior first dose study drug treatment . 16 . Inability swallow oral medication maintain fast require 2 hour 1 hour MLN8237 administration . 17 . Known history HIV infection , active hepatitis B , hepatitis C infection . Testing NOT require absence clinical finding suspicion . 18 . Known history uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome condition could result excessive daytime sleepiness , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; requirement supplemental oxygen . 19 . Patient Grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy within 14 day enrollment . 20 . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . 21 . Treatment clinically significant enzyme inducer , enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug phenytoin , carbamazepine phenobarbital , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine St. John 's wort within 14 day prior first dose MLN8237 study .</criteria>
