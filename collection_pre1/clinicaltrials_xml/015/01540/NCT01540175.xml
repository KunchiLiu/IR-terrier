	<brief_summary>Autologous stem cell rescue establish therapy high risk neuroblastoma relapse Hodgkin 's lymphoma experimental therapy solid brain tumor facilitate use intense chemotherapy beyond bone marrow tolerance . It usually tolerate acceptable toxicity graft failure practically existent . But whereas immune reconstitution allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) set widely study , investigator comprehensive data available autologous set regard recovery innate adaptive immune system . However , observation patient autoimmune disease undergo autologous HSCT suggest exact recovery patient 's pre-transplant immune system re-education reconstitution immune function . Also , recent development cancer-directed immunotherapy monoclonal antibody immunocytokines rely activity patient 's immune system via complement-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . These novel therapy give either shortly conventional chemotherapy . To find optimal time point administration immunotherapy , important know immune effector cell recover conventional myelosuppressive and/or immunosuppressive chemotherapy use Induction regimen . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital want study research participant 's immune profile prior multiple set time point autologous stem cell infusion recovery process . In subset participant investigator want study recovery lymphocyte subset function one course conventional chemotherapy precede high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant . That way investigator hope learn pace order recovery functional capacity different compartment immune system reconstitution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : - To describe immune reconstitution T cell- , B cell- natural killer ( NK ) cell- compartment patient undergo autologous stem cell transplant part treatment malignancy . The design study prospective , longitudinal observational study . Immune reconstitution measure course autologous stem cell transplant use serial blood sample analyze cell count , immune cell phenotyping ( demonstrate expression specific receptor cell surface ) functional lymphocyte assay . These blood sample obtain prior defined time point stem cell infusion either research participant hospitalize schedule clinic visit . Immune recovery conventional chemotherapy measure use serial blood sample analyze cell count , immune cell phenotyping , NK cell functional assay . These blood sample obtain prior defined time point completion course # 1 # 4 Induction chemotherapy research participant hospitalize schedule clinic visit .</detailed_description>
