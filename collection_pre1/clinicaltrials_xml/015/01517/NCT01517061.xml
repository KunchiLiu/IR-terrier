	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people lose limb feel pain miss limb . This feeling call phantom limb pain . Researchers fully understand cause pain . Differences people 's gene may play role . Comparing gene people without phantom limb pain may help researcher well understand feeling , likely develop , treat . Objectives : - To study whether genetic difference affect phantom limb pain . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age lose arm leg least 3 month ago . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants answer question lose limb , whether feel phantom limb pain . They also test measure sensitivity heat cold . - Participants provide blood sample genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The propose clinical trial investigate role human genome include genetic variation gene expression profile development phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . Study population : Patients recruit military personnel major limb amputation . A total one thousand subject upper low extremity amputation level enrol study . Design : Eight hundred subject chronic PLP ( PLP patient ) 200 patient without PLP ( non-PLP patient ) ass severity pain symptom . Each participant undergo routine blood draw DNA RNA harvest . Outcome measure : Using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 technology , identify 1 million single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) 1 million copy number variation human genome , difference genomic variation PLP non-PLP patient analyze . An extreme subset PLP patient test quantitative sensory function profile gene expression epigenetic pattern Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx . These integrative genomic analysis use genetic variation , gene expression epigenetic profile could explain amputee experience chronic PLP . By study response patient sample , evaluate role genomic factor PLP . SNP frequency , gene expression epigenetic profile PLP non-PLP group analyze .</detailed_description>
