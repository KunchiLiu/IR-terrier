	<brief_summary>Background : - Advancing age associate great risk heart disease . High blood pressure harden artery also complication age . Studies suggest age-related inflammation may affect fatty tissue body . If fat develops muscle around heart , may increase risk heart disease . Researchers study body composition old adult see age-related change body fat related high risk heart disease . Objectives : - To study relationship fat deposit age , great risk heart disease . Eligibility : - Participants Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging 50 80 year age . - Individuals 50 80 year age diagnose coronary artery disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants provide blood urine sample . They also height weight measure . Waist circumference also take . - Participants DEXA scan study muscle . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging scan . These scan study heart function muscle blood vessel health . - Participants coronary artery disease catheterization . Blood sample collect procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advancing age associate increase prevalence , incidence , complication cardiovascular disease , particularly hypertension atherosclerosis . The reason age associate increased susceptibility cardiovascular disease understood recent literature suggest systemic inflammation , affect endothelial function , vascular stiffening , diastolic dysfunction insulin resistance may important contributing cause . Aging also associate substantial change body composition , primarily increase fat mass decline lean body mass . Studies animal model human show adipose tissue important source pro-inflammatory mediator suggest change body composition may primary cause pro-inflammatory state aging . A number gene expression study animal model show gene several pro-inflammatory cytokine over-expressed aging , especially adipose tissue . The overproduction pro-inflammatory cytokine important systemic effect , include ( 1 ) endothelial dysfunction , one early feature atherosclerosis ; ( 2 ) vascular stiffening , primary etiology isolate systolic hypertension elderly ; ( 3 ) insulin resistance , principal metabolic abnormality associate cardiovascular risk . Fat infiltration liver also promote chronic inflammation directly induce apoptosis hepatocytes consequent inflammatory response deterioration liver function . Limited data exists suggest deposition adipose tissue specific district others associate high circulating level pro-inflammatory marker . For example , humans central adiposity , include fat accumulation surround heart , fat infiltration muscle , oppose subcutaneous adiposity seem particularly pro-inflammatory . However , information come small study , study limit narrow age-range . In addition , assessment regional adiposity mostly base anthropometrics . Indeed , non-invasive methodology assessment regional lipid deposition profile become available recently . We propose complement BLSA population group individual establish CAD inclusion group may help determine whether , extent , expect relationship body adiposity , inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , arterial stiffness insulin resistance different healthy individual compare age-matched individual clinically overt vascular disease . As side hypothesis , also verify whether change Testosterone age associate change regional fat accumulation . To test hypothesis measure total , free biovailable Testosterone participant .</detailed_description>
