	<detailed_description>Presently , significant lack knowledge everyday surgical practice concern treatment incisional hernia treatment corset surgery mean conservative treatment . For many year , corset use surgical department without evidence support practice . Corsets expensive require good patient compliance . Some argument use corset reduce pain tension abdominal wall prevention development recurrence incisional hernia , well use truss case conservative treatment decide . The aim project thus ameliorate lack knowledge surround corset use . More specifically , aim project clarify effect corset use 1 . Physiological parameter - Measured spirometry , Vital capacity ( VC ) , Forced Expiratory Volume ( FEV ) , Peak Expiratory Flow ( PEF ) coughPEF 2 . Patient comfort , pain self-perceived experience - Measured VAS scale pain . VHPQ ( ventral hernia pain questionary ) pain . Recording medication . Grade mobilisation . Corset treatment think affect cardiovascular respiratory function well intra abdominal pressure positive negative direction . There scientific publication specifically describe evaluate effect . One reason could assessment parameter difficult time-consuming clinical practice , instance spirometry . Less complicate alternative e.g . Peak Expiratory Flow rate ( PEF ) consider imprecise . However , recently , simpler efficient instrument develop measure lung function , Peak Cough Flow ( PCF ) . It validate use pulmonary function test patient neuromuscular disorder , use predict risk inadequate cough response mucus clearance . Moreover , portable digital spirometer develop easily use ambulatory set . Postoperatively , similar problem may arise reduction vital capacity . It therefore important investigate effect corset lung function . Many patient undergo laparotomy indwell urinary catheter first postoperative day , often result epidural anaesthesia also monitor fluid balance . A urinary catheter also allow measurement intra abdominal pressure , , together measurement systemic blood pressure , give good estimate physiological parameter use compare different treatment group . A randomised control study concern postoperative use corset laparotomy . Hypothesis : Postoperative corset-use improve respiratory physiology measure use PCF without impair spirometric parameter . Corsets also reduce pain discomfort surgery . Consecutive patient undergo laparotomy Centre Gastrointestinal surgery Karolinska University Hospital ask whether would accept participate randomise study one arm receive corset five day postoperatively receive corset laparotomy . The primary end-point PCF change , secondary end-points vital capacity , residual volume patient perception measure VHPQ . A GCP-trained research nurse extensive experience charge monitor collection data . PCF measure use portable PCF apparatus ( Peak flow meter , HS Clerment Clarke International ) whereas spirometric parameter measure use portable computer-assisted vitalograph ( IM-Medico ML 2525 ) . Pain functional status patient measure use VHPQ describe EuroQoL . Based previous measurement , normal PCF without corset assume around 360ml/min . Assuming standard deviation 40ml/min corset improves performance 10 % , 21 patient require group ( 42 total ) 95 % significance level power 80 % . In order compensate patient drop-out , plan include 50 patient . If intra abdominal pressure rise 28cmH2O sign wound infection , corset remove . The wound photograph day five patient .</detailed_description>
