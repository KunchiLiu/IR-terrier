	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop validate clinically useful molecular prognostic signature base ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) -expression array accurately distinguish good poor outcome patient stage 1B non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( T2aN0M0 ) predict risk cancer recurrence surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop validate clinically useful prognostic signature stage 1A NSCLC ( T1a-bN0M0 ) accurately predict risk post-operative cancer recurrence part prognostic classifier , also include histological , pathological , demographic parameter primary objective . II . To determine effect test accuracy histological subtype ( adenocarcinoma [ AC ] vs squamous cell [ SQA ] ) stage specific prognostic classifier . III . To determine relevant statistical feature , include accuracy predict overall survival , cancer specific survival , disease free survival 3 5 year , prognostic classifier validate . IV . To utilize validated prognostic signature classifier stage 1B NSCLC determine whether reliably predict good outcome among stage II NSCLC patient . OUTLINE : RNA extract archived tumor tissue sample analyze whole-genome expression Affymetrix microarrays ( Gene Profiling Array cGMP U133 P2 ) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .</detailed_description>
