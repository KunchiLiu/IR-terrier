	<brief_summary>The investigator propose first prospective , double blind , randomize controlled trial treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) relate underlying portal hypertension . Specifically investigator evaluate potential efficacy safety sildenafil ( Revatio ) 16 week blind , multicentre study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Revatio Portal-Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAH recognize complication portal hypertension - term portal-pulmonary hypertension ( PPHTN ) . In World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification PPHTN categorize WHO group 1 condition . This categorization appropriate PPHTN share similar pathological feature clinical presentation idiopathic ( primary ) pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Advances oral therapy PAH ( idiopathic , connective tissue disease , congenital heart disease ) defer need parenteral therapy , lung transplantation lead improvement functional capacity , quality life survival . However unlike form PAH , treatment option formally evaluate PPHTN approve medical therapy . Patients unable pay medication . Consequently patient continue endure natural progression PAH - state characterize progressive right heart failure , disability death . Furthermore unacceptable mortality associate liver transplantation presence hemodynamically significant PAH , leave therapeutic option . Therefore , new treatment option need systematically evaluate .</detailed_description>
