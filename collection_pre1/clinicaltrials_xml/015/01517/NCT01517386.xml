	<brief_summary>For effective anesthesia interventional pain treatment , correct needle placement crucial . Currently use method guide needle placement confirm actual treatment location injection medication include : image-guidance , loss-of-resistance , electrical stimulation . However , accuracy needle placement could improve information would available would complement current method . We develop so-called `` photonic needle '' technology base optical spectroscopy potential provide complementary information . This study observational study limit number patient . A common ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia procedure select , data acquire photonic needle number point along needle trajectory allow confirmation imaging . Rationale study investigate potential technology discriminate tissue relevant distinguish procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photonic Needle Paravertebral Space Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial investigate photonic needle technology reliably identify thoracic paravertebral space . Diffuse reflectance spectrum acquire needle advancement , custom-made needle stylet contain optical fiber . Main study parameter : 1 . Successfully acquire diffuse reflectance spectrum obtain thoracic paravertebral space , spectrum obtain needle advancement . 2 . Confirmation sonographic thoracic paravertebral localization , define tissue image location needle diffuse reflectance spectrum collect . 3 . Recordings reaction small test dose lidocaine 2 % epinephrine 1:200.000 target position regional anesthesia ( exclude vascular localization needle ) 4 . `` certainty score '' 3-point scale ( 1 = uncertain , 2 = certain , 3 = certain ) provide physician assignment type tissue present needle tip , base information available imaging and/or aspiration and/or reaction small injection epinephrineOther study parameters The endpoint study statistical analysis difference diffuse reflectance spectrum obtain non-paravertebral paravertebral measurement location .</detailed_description>
