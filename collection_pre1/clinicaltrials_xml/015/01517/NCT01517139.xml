	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want collect information diet , physical activity , sun exposure child young adult . The data provide information effect factor might development cancer disease . Information collect adult accurately measure factor . To collect accurate information , mother child provide information . Study participant Hebei province northeastern China Jiangsu province eastern China . Objectives : - To collect study diet , activity , sun exposure data Chinese adolescent mother . Eligibility : - Adolescents 15 17 year age Hebei Jiangsu provinces China . - Mothers study adolescent . Design : - Participants answer question diet , physical activity , time sun . - Participants wear pedometer measure activity 7 day . They also wear badge measure sun exposure 3 day . - Participants record activity food drink consume 3 day . Urine sample collect full day . - Participants grip strength test . On last day study , provide blood , saliva , toenail sample . - A small separate group adolescent provide saliva sample complete food questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest early-life exposure conjunction genetic makeup variability may important etiology many common adult cancer . Prospectively collected information adolescent early adulthood exposure lack current evidence often rely adult recall past limited array exposure variable . Long Term Objective : 1 . To investigate feasibility assess exposure may link early life exposure later disease . Exposures include diet , physical activity , UV-exposure , DNAmethylation status , body size reproductive factor . This feasibility work inform additional research exist large Chinese-U.S. CDC collaborative project conduct 1993 1995 , Community Intervention Program ( CIP ) ( n = 247,000 ) . Short Term Objectives : 2 . To determine feasibility collect assess quality data current diet , nutritional status , physical activity , physical strength , UV exposure , DNA methylation status environmental exposure early life determinant adult cancer adolescent 15 17 year age early adulthood mother . 3 . To assess difference methylation status DNA expose periconceptional folic acid supplementation unexposed . 4 . To compare dietary physical activity self-reporting instrument objective measure dietary intake physical activity , respectively . Eligibility : Pairs mother child age 15-17 year CIP , complete associate pilot study Laoting ( Task 1 ) , Hebei provincein North , Taicang , Jiangsu provincein South , agree participate study . An additional subsample 100 child complete accompany study ( Task 1 ) , agree participate sub-study eligible . Design : This pilot study include 100 pair child mother recruit 2 province . A total 50 child ( age 16-17years ) high school ( grades 9-10 ) identify province . To extent possible , approximately equal number child age 16 17 year age recruit , stratify gender utero exposure folic acid . An additional sub-sample 100 child complete accompany study ( Task 1 ) enrol saliva collection completion food frequency questionnaire .</detailed_description>
