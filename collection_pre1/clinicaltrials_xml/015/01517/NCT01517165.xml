	<brief_summary>Background : - Opioid-withdrawal symptom include runny nose , body ache , chill , sweat , diarrhea . Many people symptom try stop use opioid drug . Long-acting opioids like methadone buprenorphine use help people stop use opioids , drug cause withdrawal symptom . There non-opioid drug approve specifically treat symptom . - Pioglitazone drug use treat type 2 diabetes . In research study , drug allow heroin user decrease methadone dose faster without much discomfort , stay abstinent heroin . Researchers want learn pioglitazone help treat opioid withdrawal symptom . Objectives : - To test whether pioglitazone reduce opioid withdrawal symptom . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age use buprenorphine treat opioid dependency . Design : - This study last 17 week . Participants must come study clinic every day least 13 week . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also answer question drug use habit , provide blood urine sample . - Participants take buprenorphine daily 7 week . For first 3 week , dose increase level help stop use opioids . For next 4 week , dose decrease . Blood , urine , breath sample collect different study visit . Participants also fill questionnaire mood , drug craving , withdrawal symptom . - After 1 week buprenorphine , participant start study pill ( pioglitazone placebo ) every day . They take study pill 13 week . - During treatment period , participant drug counsel week 30 minute . - Some participant test part study . These test include functional magnetic resonance imaging scan look change brain activity give sample cerebrospinal fluid study brain chemistry . - Participants final followup phone call 3 week last clinic visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Some individual successfully maintain buprenorphine methadone appropriate candidate dose taper transition medication-free follow-up care . For individual , physical discomfort dose taper barrier successful transition . Recent data suggest novel approach : FDA-approved diabetes medication pioglitazone ( Actos ) , activate gamma ( g ) subtype peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARs ) . Pioglitazone act peripheral tissue , also brain region associate drug tolerance withdrawal . In animal model , pioglitazone prevents sign opioid withdrawal . In small , preliminary open-label clinical study , opioid-maintained outpatient give pioglitazone remarkably successful transition comfortably medication-free state , prior unsuccessful attempt without pioglitazone . These initial data provide proof principle indicate pioglitazone merit evaluation randomized-controlled study . Scientific goal : ( 1 ) To determine whether , compare placebo , pioglitazone increase successful completion opioid agonist/antagonist taper patient physically dependent opioids . ( 2 ) To determine neural mechanism effect may occur . Participant population : A total 120 opioid-dependent participant ( 80 evaluable ) enrol . Evaluable participant define randomized one two main experimental group ( pioglitazone placebo ) . Target enrollment include 25 % woman 70 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design method : The study randomize , double-blind clinical trial two treatment group ( 40 per group ) : pioglitazone ( 45 mg oral daily ) placebo . The study last 10 week . All participant receive 27 day buprenorphine/naloxone ( referred hereinafter buprenorphine ) - 14 day stabilization 13-day taper . Pioglitazone/placebo initiate week 2 continue 5 week ( 3 week concurrently buprenorphine 2 week without ) . Participants two follow-up assessment : clinic visit ( week 7 one week post-pioglitazone/placebo ) phone follow-up ( week 10 4 week post-pioglitazone/placebo ) . Participation conduct combination outpatient inpatient portion : first two week ( pre-buprenorphine taper ) outpatients ; 18 day inpatient unit ( JHBC CRU ) approximately 5 day buprenorphine taper ; 10 daily visit two follow-up visit outpatient . Throughout study , participant receive weekly individual counseling , include case management prepare post-study treatment . Data opiate-withdrawal symptom crave collected daily . Data self-reported drug use , urine specimen drug testing , collect three time weekly . A subset participant undergo functional magnetic-resonance imaging ( fMRI ) magnetic-resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) : one training session mock scanner two scanning session occur end first week buprenorphine second week buprenorphine taper . Another subset participant ( largely overlap subset undergo fMRI/MRS ) undergo one lumbar puncture measure level neurotransmitter , metabolite , proinflammatory cytokine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . At lumbar-puncture visit , blood also draw compare analyte level CSF blood . At end study , participant offer assistance transfer another treatment program , either drug-free treatment opioid-agonist treatment ( OAT ) . The primary outcome measure opioid-withdrawal severity measure SOWs COWs . Secondary outcome measure include overall proportion opioid-negative urine , proportion participant need adjunct medication , time resumption opioid use follow discharge residential unit , status follow-up , ( subset participant agree undergo lumbar puncture ) CSF level ( correspond blood level ) proinflammatory cytokine analytes , hypothesize predict outcome thereby clarify pioglitazone mechanism action . In subset participant agree undergo fMRI/MRS lumbar puncture , attempt determine neural mediator pioglitazone therapeutic effect , ( pioglitazone effective ) determine predictor treatment outcome . Post-treatment outcome measure expect affect indirectly pioglitazone ; anticipate pioglitazone reduce withdrawal symptom , enhance initial abstinence buprenorphine taper , address possible protracted withdrawal . Benefits participant and/or society : Participants receive buprenorphine taper drug counseling . There may incidental benefit buprenorphine counseling , likely reduce participant ' use opioids risk infectious disease HIV hepatitis B C. Risks participant : Participants may experience side effect pioglitazone and/or buprenorphine/naloxone likely experience discomfort opioid withdrawal . The subset participant agree undergo lumbar puncture fMRI/MRS may experience side effect procedure .</detailed_description>

Acceptable form contraception study include : hormonal contraceptive ( birthcontrol pill , injectable hormone , vaginalring hormone ) ; IUD ; diaphragm spermicide ; condom spermicide . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Any medical illness view investigator would compromise participation research ( determined Medical History ; Physical Examination ; Blood Urine Laboratory test ; see detail Screening measure ) , include , limited : Diabetes mellitus Type I Type II Past current diagnosis congestive heart failure Signs symptom consistent congestive heart failure include limited fatigue , exercise intolerance , decrease peripheral perfusion , orthopnea , dyspnea exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , peripheral edema , elevate jugularvenous pressure , pleural pericardial effusion , hepatic congestion , ascites , elevate BUN creatinine , hyponatremia , elevate serum level hepatic enzyme .

Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 40 high Additional Exclusion Criteria fMRI portion Study : Exclusion MRI component study base criterion outline . Participants qualify agree participate fMRI portion study exclude main study . Exclusion criterion assess screen NIDAIRP screen protocol 06DAN415 . Participants exclude fMRI portion study : 1. leave hand . Justification : Some neural process assess protocol may lateralize brain . In order reduce potential variance , participant require righthanded . Assessment tool ( ) : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . 2. age 55 year . Justification : Many cognitive process change age . In addition , likelihood difficulttodetect medical abnormality silent cerebral infarct increase age .
