	<brief_title>Drug-drug Interaction Study Tivantinib ( ARQ 197 ) With Omeprazole , S-warfarin , Caffeine , Midazolam , Digoxin Cancer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonclinical study indicate tivantinib ( parent molecule ) potential inhibit CYP3A4 ( [ I ] /Ki=0.15 , midazolam substrate ) , CYP2C19 ( [ I ] /Ki=0.98 ) , CYP2C9 ( [ I ] /Ki=0.44 ) , CYP1A ( [ I ] /Ki=0.37 ) , efflux transporter P glycoprotein ( P-gp ) ( I2/IC50=82 ) clinical concentration study Phase 3 development program . In addition , tivantinib major circulate plasma metabolite ( ) also show nonclinical study exhibit similar CYP inhibition potential . The result study evaluate potential tivantinib influence pharmacokinetics CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/CYP1A and/or P-gp substrate , help provide guidance clinician co-administration tivantinib drug metabolize CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/ CYP1A and/or transport P-gp .</detailed_description>
