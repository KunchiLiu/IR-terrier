	<detailed_description>GNE myopathy hereditary inclusion body myopathy ( HIBM ) severe progressive metabolic myopathy cause defect biosynthetic pathway sialic acid ( SA ) . Substrate replacement therapy potential therapeutic strategy base success replace miss SA reduce muscle disease relevant mouse model human disease ( Malicdan et al. , 2009 ) . Successful use SA replacement therapy human believe depend upon provide steady long-term exposure compound extend release form ( Sialic Acid-Extended Release [ SA-ER ] ) , give SA 's short half-life . Following Phase 1 study establish pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SA-ER , Ultragenyx conduct study ass dose potential pharmacodynamic effect restore sialylation muscle treatment SA-ER two dose level compare placebo administer two 24 week period time . The study also evaluate safety , well effect SA-ER clinical measure muscle strength , mobility , function self-reported disability quality life . Effects muscle volume/mass function serum biomarkers evaluate exploratory measure . These data allow selection dose appropriate design Phase 3 clinical study .</detailed_description>
