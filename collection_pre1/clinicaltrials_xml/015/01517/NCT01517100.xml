	<brief_summary>Background : - The endocannabinoid system involve different body function process . It help regulate appetite mood , send signal nervous system . It may also involve body produce insulin digestion . Researchers want test two drug work endocannabinoid system : nabilone CP-945,598 . These drug may able affect insulin level blood . This information may suggest possible new treatment people diabetes . Objectives : - To study endocannabinoid system involve insulin production action . Eligibility : - Healthy men 21 55 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood urine sample . They also image study test brain response , especially food-related cue . Some participant also study visit test insulin resistance level . - Participants four separate study visit 6 week apart . They keep food diary visit . At visit , one follow combination drug : - Double placebo - Placebo nabilone - Placebo low dose CP-945,598 - Placebo high dose CP-945,598 . - Participants follow-up visit 1 week study visit . Blood sample take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Specific Aims : We plan investigate whether endocannabinoid system involve regulation insulin secretion Beta cell modulation insulin action peripheral tissue human . We hypothesize cannabinoid receptor 1 ( CB1R ) antagonist CP-945,598 increase insulin secretion Beta cell improve insulin sensitivity peripheral tissue cannabinoid receptor ( CBR ) agonist nabilone decrease insulin secretion Beta cell worsen insulin sensitivity peripheral tissue . Moreover , investigate brain control initial phase insulin secretion ( cephalic insulin response ) effect central cannabinoid receptor . Experimental Design Methods : Twenty healthy men , age 21-55 , recruit study . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study . Each subject serve control person four different intervention visit space least 6 week apart . During visit , receive one follow medication random order : placebo , nabilone 2 mg , CP-945,598 15 mg , CP-945,598 45 mg. A sequential hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp procedure 3-hr oral glucose tolerance test use study effect CP-945,598 nabilone insulin secretion insulin action healthy men . To identify brain area involve cephalic insulin response , functional MRI use assess brain activation response food image association frequent blood sampling . Medical Relevance Expected Outcome : Based pre-clinical animal data , CB1R antagonist enhances insulin secretion action response glucose CBR agonist virtually shut insulin secretion worsens insulin action response glucose . The application novel , pre-clinical finding understand human biology pathobiology fundamental critical importance . This study give u good understand regulator insulin secretion Beta cell insulin sensitivity human , new understand importance find new treatment type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
