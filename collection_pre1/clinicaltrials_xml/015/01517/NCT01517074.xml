	<brief_summary>Background : Autoimmune scleritis inflammatory disease affect white out part eye . It associate immune system disorder like rheumatoid arthritis . It cause blindness severe case . Most treatment scleritis involve steroid immune-suppressing drug , cause side effect whole body . Sirolimus drug use help prevent transplant rejection . It help prevent immune system attack body . Researchers want try give sirolimus injection eye treat severe scleritis . Objectives : To see sirolimus safe effective treatment autoimmune scleritis . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age autoimmune scleritis least one eye respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , eye exam . Blood urine sample also collect . - One eye select study eye receive injection . - Participants six study visit 4 month ( initial visit week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 ) . The injection give first visit . If study eye respond treatment , participant may injections eye second visit . - If still inflammation first injection , scleritis improves return , participant may second injection Week 4 . - Injections monitor blood test eye exam . - Participants may study visit injection 1 year injection seem work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Scleritis chronic , painful potentially blind inflammatory disease characterize edema episcleral scleral tissue commonly associate systemic autoimmune disorder . Sirolimus suppress cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation thus , inhibits production , signal activity many growth factor relevant scleritis . Subconjunctival sirolimus administration could reduce eliminate need topical and/or systemic immunosuppressive drug often take immunosuppressive disorder could result reduce morbidity . The study objective investigate safety , tolerability potential efficacy subconjunctival sirolimus possible treatment active , autoimmune , non-necrotizing , anterior scleritis . STUDY POPULATION : Five participant active , autoimmune , non-necrotizing , anterior scleritis scleral inflammatory grade ≥ 1+ least one quadrant initially enrol . Participants must history past flare require oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , oral topical corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication . Up seven participant may enrol , two participant may accrue account participant withdraw study prior receive investigational product . DESIGN : This phase I/II , single-center , open-label , non-randomized , prospective uncontrolled pilot study evaluate safety possible efficacy subconjunctival sirolimus injection active , autoimmune , non-necrotizing , anterior scleritis . If two eye active , eye bad inflammation inject first ( study eye ) baseline follow two week later injection second eye ( fellow eye ) . If eye equal inflammation , study eye choose physician 's discretion consultation participant . Participants still demonstrate active inflammation experience flare-up initial study eye injection may eligible re-injection Week 4 ( exceed dose 1,320 μg per eye within eight-week period ) . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome number participant experience least 2-step reduction reduction grade 0 scleral inflammation study eye accord standardized photographic scleritis grade system develop National Eye Institute ( NEI ) Week 8 visit . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity , step change scleral inflammation , number participant experience disease flare , number participant taper standard immunosuppressive regimen 16 week , participant experience disease flare , number day disease flare baseline well number participant require re-injection due flare . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event ( AEs ) , proportion participant experience vision loss ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter number participant experience substantial rise elevate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .</detailed_description>
