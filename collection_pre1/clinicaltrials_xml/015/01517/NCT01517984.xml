	<brief_summary>The study compare well transplant kidney work response people 's immune system tacrolimus , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) , withdrawn . In addition , research study evaluate whether reduce immunosuppression decrease side effect still prevent rejection kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Monitoring CNI Withdrawal Low Risk Recipients Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation treatment option people kidney disease . However , still much learn best care transplant kidney keep function long time . Transplant recipient take immunosuppression ( anti-rejection ) drug prevent body reject new kidney . These drug use prevent immune system attack transplant kidney . All anti-rejection medication unwanted side effect . The purpose study evaluate safety slowly remove tacrolimus , CNI .</detailed_description>
