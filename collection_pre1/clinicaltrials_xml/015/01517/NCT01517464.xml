	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Systemic Gene Therapy With SGT-94 Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RB94 , tumor suppressor gene , modify form retinoblastoma gene , RB110 . RB94 show enhanced tumor suppressor tumor cell kill activity compare RB110 tumor cell type study date , include bladder cancer cell line . Moreover , RB94 show toxicity normal human cell test . SGT-94 , agent test , systemically administer complex compose RB94 gene ( plasmid DNA ) encapsulate liposome targeted tumor cell mean anti-transferrin receptor single chain antibody fragment ( TfRscFv ) attach outside liposome . Pre-clinical vivo efficacy study indicate SGT-94 , systemically administer , preferentially target tumor cell efficiently transfects . This result cancer cell death via mechanism unique RB94 also increase tumor 's response conventional radiation chemotherapy . This Phase I study design evaluate safety SGT-94 establish practically attainable and/or tolerable dose anti-cancer agent use clinical trial . Additionally , evidence RB94 expression within tumor tissue systemic administration SGT-94 seek , clinically observable anti-cancer effect patient document . Enrollment target individual `` RB negative '' tumor , i.e . tumor stain RB protein immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Preference give patient tumor location amenable biopsy follow treatment SGT-94 . This would include prostate , bladder , superficial lymph node mass suitable fine needle aspiration CT ultrasound guidance , lesion reachable endoscopy .</detailed_description>

Some prior cancer therapy consistent eligibility ; specifically : At least 30 day must elapse since prior experimental therapy At least 6 week must elapse since prior systemic mitomycin C At least 8 week must elapse since dose Strontium89 At least 4 week must elapse since prior Sm153 lexidronam ( Quadramet™ ) At least 4 week must elapse since prior radiotherapy Any prior exposure gene vector delivery product Pregnancy lactation Serious concurrent medical illness opinion investigator would compromise patient safety preclude accurate assessment outcome . Patients follow manifestation cardiovascular disease exclude : Myocardial infarction ( MI ) within previous six month , patient leave ventricular ejection fraction le 45 % secondary remote MI . Any history CVA TIA previous six month New York Heart Association grade 2 great congestive failure Unstable angina define angina ( anginal equivalent ) 2 time per week despite medical therapy . Echocardiographic evidence pulmonary hypertension . Diastolic dysfunction felt contribute clinical sign symptom . Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic BP &gt; 140 diastolic &gt; 90 despite therapy . Serious concurrent psychiatric disorder opinion investigator would compromise patient safety preclude accurate assessment outcome .
