	<brief_summary>The aim study determine impact package smoking-cessation intervention composite measure Tuberculosis ( TB ) treatment-related outcome . Given lack objective clinical data/evidence impact smoking-cessation TB-related outcome , yet subjective expert opinion smoke cessation highly likely beneficial particularly patient TB , study proposes determine impact intensive package smoking-cessation intervention aim promote smoking-cessation ( counsel plus nicotine replacement therapy , NRT ) , patient response anti-tuberculosis therapy . This compare structure counsel smoking-cessation recommend routinely provide health care worker patient smoker . If result prove smoking-cessation PI indeed improve outcome TB patient , information would strongly motivate institution intensive smoking-cessation intervention TB clinic currently employ TB patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>No clinical trial do determine cessation smoke influence outcome tuberculosis patient . In particular , smoke cessation lead high rate sputum culture-conversion 2 month , TB transmission rate reduce . Such targeted smoking-cessation intervention may successful general public education strategy reduce spread TB high-incidence country Tuberculosis ( TB ) . The WHO estimate approximately third world 's population infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis , approximately 2 million die TB every year . Tobacco smoking , single preventable cause death world today , appear important risk factor TB disease mortality , especially country India . The smoking-TB association major public health implication many develop country high prevalence TB , smoking also common practice . Smoking widespread , approximately third global population age 15 year smoker , reach epidemic proportion country India , China Russia . For example , India half rural male population estimate smoke India account 1.85 million TB case year . Therefore India , develop country , co-existence high TB smoking burden major health concern , underscore importance promote smoke cessation general public . In India , study show strong association tobacco TB mortality . An estimated third male TB death India may due smoking . However , concern many publish study adequately control bias confounding ( may cause spurious association ) .</detailed_description>
