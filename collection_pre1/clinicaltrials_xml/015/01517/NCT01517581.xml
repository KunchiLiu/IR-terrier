	<brief_summary>White brown adipocytes differ expression hormone , cytokine , inflammatory factor , modulate different biological function . While white adipose tissue ( WAT ) serve primary site energy storage , brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) instead metabolize fat produce heat regulate body temperature . BAT likely present human , low prevalence BAT depiction adult elderly subject hinder longitudinal assessment relation BAT activity WAT . Under typical imaging condition , BAT detect frequently child teenager adult malignancy . Since child cancer significantly shorter treatment course great survival rate compare adult patient , investigator ability examine relation repeat measure body composition BAT select pediatric patient . In study , investigator longitudinally examine whether BAT activity relate change weight amount SAT , VAT , abdominal muscle child successfully treat pediatric cancer .</brief_summary>
