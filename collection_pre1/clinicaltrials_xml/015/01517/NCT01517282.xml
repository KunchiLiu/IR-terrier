	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease associate central nervous system ( CNS ) demyelination subsequent axonal degeneration . Multiple sclerosis exhibit unpredictable variable clinical course . Multiple sclerosis plaque contain numerous type cell infiltrate macrophage identify contribute significantly demyelination clinical MS animal model MS. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM CSF ) stimulate proliferation activation macrophage , monocyte , neutrophil , eosinophil , dendritic cell microglia subsequent induction proinflammatory biomolecules . Therefore block GM CSF activity might therapeutic approach treatment MS .</brief_summary>
