	<brief_summary>Metal-on-metal total hip replacement ( MoM THR ) target young patient anticipated long-term survival since bearing surface wear less traditional metal-on-plastic ( MoP ) replacement . However , production metal ion result wear concern possible toxicity cell . In Norwich England number different metal-on-metal implant trialed one , Ultima TPS , poor result . A total 545 patient 652 MoM THRs Ultima TPS 20 % revise . There ongoing MHRA program screen problem use MRI scan technique develop Norwich . Investigations far show massive corrosion implant catastrophic immune response cause death cell . This may include death bone leading fracture . In third patient revise pain normal plain X-rays . In patient without pain screen abnormal change MRI scan . We wish investigate immune cell patient find happened . The study include patient come new hip act comparator , well MoM THR patient revise MoM THRs , MoP THRs . We shall also investigate patient MoM THRs opportunistically .</brief_summary>
