	<brief_summary>Background : - Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) MC4R genetic mutation two condition cause problem appetite regulation . People PWS often behavior think problem . People MC4R mutation may problem attention . These problem may relate Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) , protein important brain development . Researchers want study people PWS MC4R mutation see BDNF involved condition . Specifically , body weight brain function study , compare healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To study BDNF affect body weight brain function people PWS MC4R mutation . Eligibility : - Individuals age Prader-Willi syndrome MC4R genetic mutation . - Healthy volunteer age act control participant . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . Height , weight , waist/hip circumference measure . Blood sample take genetic test . - Participants fill questionnaire eat habit , pain perception , sleep behavior . - Participants keep 3-day food diary record food drink eat . - Tests questionnaire give study thinking , speech , movement , behavior , mood . Some test do computer ; test paper . Tests may also involve perform task block object . - Participants may test direct . These include hot cold sensitivity test , image study like x-ray , measurement body fat water content . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) protein important nervous system development function . BDNF also appear function downstream leptin-melanocortin signal pathway control appetite . In animal human , diminish BDNF function associate hyperphagia , obesity , neurocognitive deficit . We propose study BDNF two hyperphagic disorder : Prader-Willi syndrome MC4R function-altering mutation . We hypothesize patient PWS may increase BDNF infancy , follow decline BDNF precede onset hyperphagia persist onset obesity . We hypothesize patient MC4R mutation decrease BDNF , severity associate degree MC4R functional loss cause specific mutation ( ) individual . To test hypothesis , wish conduct cross-sectional study evaluate serum BDNF concentration , metabolism , body composition , neurocognition : subject PWS , subject MC4R mutation control subject match age , sex , race , BMI . If alteration BDNF find associate PWS and/or MC4R mutation , investigation could lead future study BDNF receptor agonists mechanism-specific pharmacologic therapy hyperphagia obesity PWS MC4R mutation , BDNF receptor antagonists failure-to-thrive neonatal PWS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject 1 . For PWS subject : We enroll 75 subject ages diagnosis PWS confirm chromosome analysis ( i.e . interstitial deletion paternallyderived chromosome 15q , uniparental maternal disomy chromosome 15 abnormality ) . Our goal 25 infant , 25 nonobese , 25 obese subject order ass different phase associate PWS . Subjects receive growth hormone therapy may enroll dose stable precede 6 month . 2 . For MC4R subject : We screen 200 subject mutation MC4R enroll 50 subject ages diagnosis homozygous heterozygous MC4R mutation confirm sequence MC4R gene . Both functionalaltering ( N=25 ) nonpathologic ( N=25 ) mutation include . 3 . For control subject : We enroll 125 subject age match PWS MC4R subject age ( plusminus 10 % ) , sex , race , BMI percentile ( plusminus10 % ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject 1 . For subject : 1 . Pregnancy 2 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study 3 . If age &gt; 12 month , great 2 % body weight loss precede 6 month 4 . Anorexiant weight loss medication use precede 6 month 2 . For control subject : 1 . Chronic medical condition anticipate affect result impede study participation 2 . Medication use review casebycase basis Principal Investigator determine eligibility</criteria>
