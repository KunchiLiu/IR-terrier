	<brief_title>Prevalence Peripheral Neuropathy Children Adolescents With Type I Diabetes Mellitus : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number newly diagnose patient diabetes mellitus type I increase every year , patient become young . The Austrian Diabetes Incidence Study Group demonstrate significant constant increase incidence rate 12.0 18.4/100,000 child adolescent â‰¤15 year age 1999 2007 [ 7 ] . So , confront child adolescent suffer complication determine long-term outcome . Chronic disease complication important impact quality expectation life health resource . Among long-term complication diabetes , vascular complication include retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , macrovascular disease prevalent [ 2 ] . The main therapeutic goal avoid complication early detection clinical , even well , subclinical sign . For reason , International Society Pediatric Adolescent Diabetes ( ISPAD ) periodically issue Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines , particularly screen vascular complication [ 2 ] . With regard diabetic neuropathy ( DN ) still uncertainty time frame , intensity diagnostic method choice , despite significant source morbidity mortality [ 3 ] . Additionally , considerable uncertainty prevalence DN due lack large epidemiological study consensus diagnostic criterion [ 4 ] . The American Academy Neurology suggest combination objective symptom , sign electrophysiology provide accurate diagnosis distal symmetric polyneuropathy [ 5 ] . Nerve conduction study consider many `` gold standard '' nerve damage consistent indicator ( sub- ) clinical neuropathy [ 6 ] . So far , several cross-sectional study conduct nerve conduction velocity diabetic child . The result regard prevalence largely divergent . We find 15 39 patient ( 38.5 % ) pathological nerve conduction velocity . This result neither correlate clinical symptom score ( Young Score consist Neurological Deficiency Score , NDS Neuropathy Symptom Score , NSS ) [ 10 ] , mean HbA1c , patient age , duration diabetes , body mass index , insulin regime , hour sport metabolic test result . Only one long-term prospective study address issue development diabetic neuropathy juvenile population do far [ 8 ] . To good understand long term development diabetic neuropathy plan study peripheral nerve conduction velocity population diabetic child outpatient clinic . At time , neurological examination use Young Score , clinical score peripheral neuropathy [ 10 ] . The result obtain related long-term vascular complication ( nephropathy , retinopathy ) , glycaemic control , duration diabetes , insulin dose regime , hour sports/week , BMI</detailed_description>
