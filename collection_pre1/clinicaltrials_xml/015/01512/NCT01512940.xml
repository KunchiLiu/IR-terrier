	<detailed_description>Since acceptance surgical procedure achieve sustainable weight loss , many different procedure try variable success . Among , various gastric restrictive procedure evolve year abandon due poor long term weight loss , food intolerance severe gastroesophageal reflux . Currently , laparoscopic adjustable gastric band ( LAGB ) sleeve gastrectomy use variable acceptance success . Laparoscopic gastric plication laparoscopic great curvature plication ( LGCP ) recently do alternative restrictive procedure . But short long term safety efficacy outcomes LGCP well document current literature . American society metabolic bariatric surgery ( ASMBS ) guideline state LGCP procedure consider investigational time perform study protocol third party oversight ( e.g . IRB ) ensure continuous evaluation patient safety review adverse event outcomes . A prospective nonrandomized study Cleveland clinic suggest reduction gastric capacity achieve way plication stomach thereby achieve encourage weight loss . We intend study procedure alternative LAGB sleeve gastrectomy carefully select patient . The objective study demonstrate feasibility , short term long term safety efficacy LGCP . This do achieve gastric restriction infolding stomach thereby achieve good weight loss . The subject follow post operatively observe effect comorbidities along sustained weight loss . The inclusion exclusion criterion , target population , duration subject participation primary endpoint define data record per protocol .</detailed_description>
