	<brief_summary>The incidence prevalence end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Taiwan high worldwide 2001 2008 . In Taiwan , 90 % ESRD patient hemodialysis patient . Either arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) arteriovenous graft ( AV graft ) essential vascular access patient . However , frequent AVF stenosis thrombosis occur 10-30 % hemodialytic patient , rate even high , around 30-70 % , past history AVF/AV graft stenosis . Therefore , early detection AVF stenosis essential care hemodialysis patient term medical economics psychological impact . Unfortunately , angiographic study expensive invasive need contrast medium injection . The diagnostic accuracy color duplex ultrasound AVF stenosis remain satisfactory , always available decreased AVF flow acute thrombotic event occur . Continuous AVF/ AV graft flow monitoring patient good option term long-term care . Previous study indicate stethoscope waveform analysis could use alternative diagnosis vascular stenosis . Therefore , aim investigate AVF/ AV graft stenosis use electronic stethoscope ( 3M Littmann ) AVF sound recording , follow software analysis use waveform decomposition , principle component analysis ( PCA ) sequential forward selection algorithm [ xx ] . Our study result provide new diagnostic option , low cost , non-invasive self-monitoring , AVF stenosis ESRD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis well-established method removal fluid uremic toxin prolong survival patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . The common permanent vascular ass autogenous non-autogenous arteriovenous ( AV ) fistula , refer AV fistula AV graft , respectively . In Taiwan , incidence prevalence ESRD remain high worldwide . However , frequent vascular stenosis/ thrombosis event occur repeat needle puncture . These exert large economic burden society psychological impact ESRD patient [ 1 ] . Therefore , essential develop easy patient-centered method monitor flow status either AV fistula AV graft . Physical examination auscultation simple monitoring method assess vascular access . There several sign report associated vascular stenosis , prolong bleeding , arm edema , change pulse characteristic vascular access , need high level skill experience operator , doctor nurse [ 2 ] . Unfortunately , angiographic study expensive invasive need contrast medium injection . The diagnostic accuracy color duplex ultrasound AVF stenosis remain satisfactory , always available decreased AVF flow acute thrombotic event occur . Continuous AVF/ AV graft flow monitoring patient good option term long-term care . Previous study indicate stethoscope waveform analysis could use alternative diagnosis vascular stenosis . Previous acoustic study indicate increase sound intensity , extra sound , high spectral energy infrequency domain , range 300 Hz 1000 Hz . These finding associate change laminar flow turbulent flow downstream site vascular stenosis [ 3 ] . In addition , phonoangiography study point systolic peak stenotic segment high narrow time domain compare non-stenotic segment Methods : This observational cohort study . We plan recruit 150 eligible patient ESRD regular hemodialysis least one year national Taiwan University Hospital . 1 . Data gather A . The first group patient ( study group ) recruit hose refer endovascular intervention , e.g . angioplasty , due vascular access dysfunction ( n=30 ) . An electronic stethoscope ( 3M-Littmann ) use record digital sound signal 5 point 30 second , include AV junction , proximal distal needle puncture site , respectively . All data transfer computer anlaysis . B . The second group ( validation cohort ) recruit patient regular hemodialysis ( HD ) receive angioplasty National Taiwan University Hospital ( n=120 ) . Those patient receive angioplasty AVF AV graft stenosis also receive follow-up angiography 12 week angioplasty . We record digital AVF/AV graft sound signal mention . In addition , blood pressure AVF/AVG venous pressure , heart rate record . Diameter stenosis restenotic segment also record diameter stenosis 50 % regarded significant . 2 . Post-processing The propose method base analysis envelope sound signal . Before , calculate envelope , signal down-sampled 2k Hz , follow linear-phase , finite impulse response low-pass filter . PCA apply analysis describe previously [ 1-4 ] . PCA ( principal component analysis ) 3 . Analysis Sensitivity , specificity diagnostic accuracy calculate base diagnostic criterion basal function . Area ROC curve calculate base diagnostic criterion derive PCA method .</detailed_description>
