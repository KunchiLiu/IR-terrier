	<brief_title>BKM120 Combined With Vemurafenib ( PLX4032 ) BRAFV600E/K Mutant Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1 portion trial dose escalation study ; phase 2 portion single-stage , single arm prospective clinical trial . All patient receive continuous dos vemurafenib twice day BKM120 day . In phase 1 portion study , 7 day lead-in period allow single dose pharmacokinetic analysis BKM120 alone . Cycle 1 ( 28 day ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) period . During phase 1 , vemurafenib BKM120 dos escalate use standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme goal identify recommend phase 2 dose . In phase 2 portion study , patient receive continuous dos vemurafenib BKM120 start day 1 first cycle . In phase 2 portion study , patient receive vemurafenib BKM120 recommend phase 2 dose .</detailed_description>
