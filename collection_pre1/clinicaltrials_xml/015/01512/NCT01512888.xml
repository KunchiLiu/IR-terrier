	<brief_summary>SCID-X1 genetic disorder blood cell cause DNA change gene require normal development human immune system . The purpose study determine new method , call lentiviral gene transfer , use treat SCID-X1 . This method involve transfer normal copy common gamma chain gene participant 's bone marrow stem cell . The investigator want determine procedure safe , whether do accord method develop , whether procedure provide normal immune system patient . It hop type gene transfer may offer new way treat child SCID-X1 brother sister use donor stem cell transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bone marrow CD34+ cell obtain operating room , transduce lentiviral vector contain normal copy γc gene , reinfused without myeloreductive conditioning . Participants monitor hematopoietic recovery busulfan severe adverse event 42 day . The primary endpoint assess efficacy approach T-cell immune reconstitution 52 week ( + 2 ) week transplantation . Continued detailed evaluation aspect immune reconstitution , protocol-related toxicity , retroviral integration site also perform . This study evaluate first use SIN lentiviral vector treatment SCID-X1 may lead new form therapy could apply majority newly diagnose patient . OBJECTIVES Assess safety , feasibility efficacy lentiviral gene transfer newly diagnose SCID-X1 patient transplant autologous CD34+ cell transduce self-inactivating lentiviral vector ( CL20-i4-EF1α-hγc-OPT ) express γc gene . Primary Objective 1 : Evaluate safety feasibility infuse least 1 million transduce CD34+ cell per kilogram body weight SCID-X1 infant . Primary Objective 2 : Evaluate efficacy lentiviral gene transfer induce significant T-cell reconstitution 52 week ( ± 2 week ) transplantation . Significant reconstitution T cell define least 2 follow 3 criteria present : - The development T-cell proliferative response phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ≥ 50 % value see normal control - ≥ 1000 autologous CD3+ T-cells/μl peripheral blood - ≥ 500 autologous CD4+ T-cells/μl peripheral blood - ≥ 200 autologous CD4+ CD45RA T-cells/μl peripheral blood OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : - Correlate busulfan metabolite pharmacokinetics toxicity , efficacy , engraftment vector-transduced cell , event-free survival overall survival . - Evaluate efficacy busulfan dose-targeting busulfan administration every 24 hour total 2 dos order achieve cumulative busulfan area curve 22 mg*hr/L . - Evaluate B-cell function longterm follow-up protocol patient . Evaluation include γc expression circulate B-cells , measurement serum IgG , IgA , IgM concentration , measurement antibody responses vaccination , evaluation IgG production cessation intravenous gamma globulin therapy patient clinical indication discontinue IVIG . - Evaluate NK cell number long term follow-up protocol patient . Evaluation include flow cytometry evaluation NK cell number . - Determine vector copy number location vector-integration site sort blood cell . Sorted T-cells , B-cells , NK cell , granulocyte monocyte evaluate vector copy number . Vector copy number sort T-cells evaluate potential safety measure report FDA vector copy number great 3 copy per T cell patient time . Studies sort cell also include deep sequencing automate sequencer characterize insertion site , expression array analysis T-cell clone assay gene expression alteration within 100 kb insertion site . - Evaluate overall , long-term safety lentiviral gene transfer . This include complete clinical evaluation AEs result gene transfer procedure . If oncogenic event see , evaluation include complete molecular characterization tumor clone include insertion site analysis , gene expression analysis , evaluation LMO2 , Cdkn2a , Notch1 , Cyclin D2 gene alteration .</detailed_description>
