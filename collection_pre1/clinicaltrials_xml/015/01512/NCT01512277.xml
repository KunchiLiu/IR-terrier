	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study evaluate safety immunogenicity adult healthy volunteer vaccine candidate schistosomiasis name Bilhvax .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Bilhvax , Vaccine Candidate Against Schistosomiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development efficient vaccine human schistosomiasis represent major challenge improvement health many develop country . Schistosomiasis affect million people numerous country hamper economical development tropical area . Although progress make limitation disease severity chemotherapy , continuous re-infection risk drug resistance point necessary development alternative strategy . It widely agree immunological prevention chronic parasitic infection extremely difficult achieve . Conversely major helminth infection like schistosomiasis , parasite egg lay tissue exclusive cause pathology elimination egg nature source transmission , inhibition parasite fecundity might represent future novel way prevent deleterious effect chronic infection man . The concept target vaccination cause pathology rather parasite would provide potent tool control major chronic infection . After year basic study effector regulatory mechanism immune response schistosomiasis identify schistosome molecule name glutathione S-transferase 28 kDa ( 28GST ) present potential vaccine candidate . This 28GST clone name Bilhvax . It show immunization schistosome GST would dramatically decrease female worm fecundity egg viability various host . It demonstrate anti-fecundity effect associate production antibody neutralize GST enzymatic activity obtain Th2-type immune response . This correlation anti-fecundity effect inhibition-mediated antibody demonstrate several animal model re-enforced epidemiological study show acquired antibody produce infection could detect adult individual naturally resistant re-infection . The present phase 1 clinical trial conduct healthy Caucasian volunteer evaluate primary endpoint safety recombinant Sh28GST ( rSh28GST ) Alum ( name Bilhvax ) , vaccine candidate human urinary schistosomiasis . The secondary endpoint evaluate immunogenicity Bilhvax , determine profile immune response , estimate neutralizing capacity antibodies rSh28GST enzymatic activity . The recombinant S. haematobium 28GST express yeast produce Eurogentec SA GMP condition .</detailed_description>
