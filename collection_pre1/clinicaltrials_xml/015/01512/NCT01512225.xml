	<brief_title>Enhancing Breast Milk Production With Domperidone Mothers Preterm Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It widely acknowledge recent perinatal neonatal technological advance ( eg . assist ventilation , surfactant , antenatal corticosteroid ) greatly enhance survival rate low birth weight ( VLBW ) extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infant . A compelling body evidence exist suggest use breast milk fee preterm infant initial hospitalization positively impact neurodevelopment early childhood beyond . In order provide breastmilk , mother preterm infant begin produce mechanically express milk . However , mother often face challenge maintain adequate volume meet infant ' nutritional need , well decline production several week despite myriad measure design assist production . The primary hypothesis study Domperidone , pharmacologic action increase prolactin level , assist mother experience inadequate breast milk production increase breast milk volume level identify sufficient continue pump hospitalization period .</detailed_description>
