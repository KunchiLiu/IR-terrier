	<brief_title>Clinical Study Veloderm Treatment Split-thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rational oxygen permeability Veloderm dressing also provide good environment wound heal . Therefore , temporary skin substitute case miss epidermis play role , order provide ideal environment wound epithelialization . As regard safety , 1 adverse reaction occur test group . It show effusion dress mild inflammatory infiltration wound edge . After dress change effusion drain , patient relieve . As Veloderm dress direct anti-inflammatory effect , clinical application appropriate plus anti-infective drug accordance patient condition . In conclusion , Veloderm safe effective dress accelerate heal donor site burn plastic surgery . Veloderm use temporary skin substitute case damage skin loss superficial epidermal ( burn , wound , abrasion , ulcer , sores auto-graft donor area ) .</detailed_description>
