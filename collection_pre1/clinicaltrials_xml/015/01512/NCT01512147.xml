	<brief_summary>The investigator want know use study drug dexmedetomidine improve nerve wave reading neurosurgery . These reading do many time surgery patient asleep . The reading look nerve work let operate team know nerve hurt surgery . If reading tell nerve work correctly , surgeon help change way operate . The study drug use addition general anesthesia patient give . The nerve reading investigator get use study drug compare nerve reading investigator get use study drug . The study hypothesis dexmedetomidine change nerve reading .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Intraoperative Somatosensory Motor Evoked Potential Monitoring During Neurosurgery Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) motor evoke potential ( MEP ) become integral component intraoperative care patient result high degree sensitivity predict neurologic outcome . According Padberg , Nuwer Ecker , SSEP MEP monitoring allow surgical intervention occur early thus decrease incidence postoperative neurologic deficit . These measurement do surgery general anesthesia know anesthetic agent dose-dependent adverse effect ability record evoke potential response . All anesthesia agent seem interfere measurement especially high dos . In 1999 , dexmedetomidine , highly specific selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist sedative , anxiolytic analgesic effect , get FDA approve adult patient sedation . Since , also widely use off-label various setting ; describe successful adjunct surgical procedure adolescent adult population SSEP/ MEP monitor beneficial . Several small retrospective study show dexmedetomidine appear interfere neurophysiological monitoring use FDA approve dos . In pediatric patient , dexmedetomidine also use off-label show beneficial . In fact , Doernbecher Childen 's Hospital , use dexmedetomidine become standard pediatric procedure involve SSEP MEP measurement . To best knowledge , prospective study pediatric patient SSEP monitor use dexmedetomidine complete . If dexmedetomidine interfere SSEP/MEP reading , might advantageous adjunct use setting . Propofol small risk serious side effect call propofol infusion syndrome . Propofol infusion syndrome potentially life threatening , development profound lactate acidosis . It see large dos propofol ( usually prolong infusion ) give pediatric population .</detailed_description>
