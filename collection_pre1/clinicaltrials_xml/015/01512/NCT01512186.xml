	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Investigating Upfront Pazopanib In Metastatic Renal Cancer Renal Cancer ( Panther )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label study evaluate pre-operative pazopanib treatment previously untreated patient metastatic clear cell renal cancer . This study follow Simon 2 stage design Patients take pazopanib 14 week follow nephrectomy . The drug continue nephrectomy disease progression document . Patients come study disease progression occur , follow survival . Subsequent treatment discretion treat physician document . After surgery , patient radiologically evaluate 8 weekly progression . Standard radical nephrectomy lymph node dissection perform patient deem operable . The surgery laparoscopic open . Those deem suitable nephrectomy 14 week treatment offer repeat biopsy .</detailed_description>
