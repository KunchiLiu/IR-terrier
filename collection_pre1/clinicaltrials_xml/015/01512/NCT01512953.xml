	<detailed_description>In manage patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , rapid predictable platelet inhibition patient important therapeutic goal . Determining optimal dose antiplatelet therapy achieve goal hamper considerable interpatient variability response clopidogrel , largely reflect gene polymorphism . Most evidence centre around cytochrome 450 2C19 . A substudy TRITON TIMI 38 recently show among person treat clopidogrel , carrier reduced-function CYP2C19 allele significantly low level active metabolite clopidogrel , diminish platelet inhibition , high rate major adverse cardiovascular event , include stent thrombosis , noncarriers ( N Engl J Med 2009 ; 360:354-62 ) . As contrary , common functional CYP genetic variant affect active drug metabolite level , inhibition platelet aggregation , clinical cardiovascular event rate person treat prasugrel ( Circulation . 2009 May 19 ; 119 ( 19 ) :2553-60 ) . More recently , show CYP2C19*17 carrier status significantly associate enhanced response clopidogrel increase risk bleeding . ( Circulation . 2010 ; 121:512-518 ) . Whether CYP2C19*17 carrier status enhance response prasugrel unknown . Attention also place potential interaction observe clopidogrel widely use proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) . The CYP2C19 isoform key enzyme metabolism many PPIs , also inhibitor CYP2C19 isoenzyme vary degree . This important antiplatelet effect clopidogrel rely , degree , upon CYP2C19 activity . However , recent COGENT study sub-analysis TRITON-TIMI 38 apparently mitigated concern . Nevertheless , unknown whether PPI father blunt response clopidogrel especially patient carry loss function 2C19 allele . A recent review paper ( Aliment Pharmacol Ther 31 , 810-823 ) include 23 study cover 93,278 patient . There substantial heterogeneity meta-analyses major cardiovascular event ( 19 study , I2 = 79 % ) myocardial infarction ( 12 study , I2 = 77 % ) . Analysis propensity-matched randomize trial participant show associate cardiovascular risk PPIs , whereas observational study generally show significant association . Thus , still today emerge need study , especially prospective randomize study , investigate effect individual PPI agent clopidogrel 's effectiveness . Such study also include genetic component stratify response base presence reduced-function allele CYP2C19 enzyme</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All comer patient undergo PCI recruit consecutive basis . â€¢ Patients undergo screen soon PCI depend clinical presentation follow : STEMI patient receive upstream treatment 600 mg clopidogrel PCI undergo screen 2C19 status within 24 hour treatment . Randomization occur immediately thereafter . Stable NSTEACS patient treat upstream 600 mg clopidogrel undergo screen either PCI soon ( within 6 hour ) revascularisation . In scenarios randomization occur immediately genotype status know without additional delay . 1 . Patients give inform consent life expectancy &lt; 1 year 2 .
