	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safe effective proton-beam therapy ( PBT ) may comparison intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) combination chemotherapy patient esophageal cancer . PBT IMRT form radiation therapy design treat specific area body affect little surround normal tissue possible . PBT new technology design reduce amount radiation affect surround normal tissue . However , still study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Beam Therapy ( PBT ) Versus Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group : - If Group 1 , receive IMRT . - If Group 2 , receive PBT . You receive radiation therapy 1 time day , 5 day week ( Monday Friday ) 28 treatment . Your doctor may think best interest also receive chemotherapy receiving radiation therapy . If occurs , sign separate consent form drug full description give risk may cause . Study Visits : Before begin receive radiation therapy , baseline visit . The following test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Your performance status record . - You PET/CT CT scan check status disease . - You lung function test - You complete symptom quality life questionnaire . - Your esophagus examine use endoscope . If doctor think need , biopsy check status disease . You study visit every week receive radiation therapy . The following test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status , weight , vital sign record . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You complete symptom quality life questionnaire . Length Study : You receive radiation therapy 28 treatment ( 5Â½ week ) . You longer able receive radiation therapy disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up : After stop receive radiation therapy , 4-6 week break . During time , contact 2 time week complete symptom quality life questionnaire . You receive call automated call service study staff schedule time choose . You continue follow routinely treatment follow-up visit test . About 4-6 week stop receive radiation therapy , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status , weight , vital sign record . - You PET/CT scan check status disease . - You lung function test . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You complete symptom quality life questionnaire . - Your esophagus examine use endoscope . If doctor think need , biopsy check status disease . If doctor think best interest complete radiation therapy , surgery remove tumor . You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk . As part study , study doctor check side effect discomfort surgery . Every 3-4 month 2 year , every 4-6 month next 3 year , follow-up visit . The following test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status , weight , vital sign record . - You either CT PET/CT scan check status disease . - You complete symptom quality life questionnaire . ( If disease get bad , questionnaire longer complete . ) Additionally , follow test procedure perform follow-up visit doctor think need : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) may draw routine test . - You may lung function test . - Your esophagus examine use endoscope . If doctor think need , biopsy check status disease . You may contact study staff ask health , even choose return MD Anderson follow-up visit complete treatment esophageal cancer . This investigational study . IMRT PBT deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . It investigational compare IMRT PBT . Up 180 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
