	<brief_summary>Life style intervention promote exercise healthy diet , potential improve health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , may particularly appropriate cancer survivor . The previous study suggest key strategy implement sustainable healthy behavior improve health provide appropriate feedback promote self-efficacy . Web-based program enables provide feedback timely manner daily basis , continue healthy behavior . Therefore , investigator develop web-based , stage-matched Exercise Diet Planning program , whether program promote significantly great change behavioral outcome [ goal exercise ( energy expenditure aerobic exercise ≥ 12.5 kcal/kg/week ) diet ( intake vegetable ≥ 5 serv/day intake fruit ≥ 1 serv/day ) ] , stage change exercise diet , psychosocial outcome ( HRQOL , fatigue , anxiety depression ) self-efficacy implement goal exercise diet among breast cancer survivor Korea examine . Hypotheses follow : 1 . Survivors group participate web-based , stage-matched Exercise Diet Planning program ( hereinafter call 'intervention group ' ) show advanced stage change exercise diet compare survivor control group . 2 . The intervention group show high proportion attain goal exercise ( high level energy expenditure aerobic exercise ) compare control group . 3 . The intervention group show high proportion attain goal diet ( high level diet quality ) compare control group . 4 . The intervention group show good HRQOL level compare control group . 5 . The intervention group show good self-efficacy level compare control group . 6 . The intervention group show low fatigue level compare control group . 7 . The intervention group show less anxiety compare control group . 8 . The intervention group show less depression compare control group .</brief_summary>
