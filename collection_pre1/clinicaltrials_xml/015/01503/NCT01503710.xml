	<brief_title>Early Diagnosis Postoperative Acute Renal Failure-using Biomarker Predict Outcome Cardiac Surgery Associated Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common syndrome Intensive Care Unit , renal dysfunction would result morbidity mortality . Critical ill complicate acute kidney injury usually accompany multi-organ failure . Therefore , National Taiwan University Hospital Study group Acute Renal Failure ( NSARF ) realize characteristic AKI result perfusion less body fluid attempt develop therapy prevent attenuate AKI , limited success . We attempt use novel biomarker soluble hemojuvelin ( sHJV ) evaluate iron homeostasis acute kidney injury develop new strategy therapy protease inhibitor kidney function , safety marker monitor toxicity measure treatment effect . Besides , focus validation sensitivity specificity sHJV clinical specimen post-operative patient NSARF data-bank . Merge renal function type biomarkers panel predict post-operative outcome . Based different expression marker , use panel serum urine marker may potentially help u distinguish various type insult , establish duration severity injury , predict clinical outcome help monitor response treatment AKI .</detailed_description>
