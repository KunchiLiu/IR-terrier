	<brief_summary>Giant Axonal Neuropathy ( GAN ) devastate rare childhood disease . Children GAN develop increase muscle weakness , impaired sensation , time mental retardation . GAN start infancy , lead significant disability , typically lead death within first 30 year life . GAN cause defect `` gigaxonin '' ( GAN ) gene , result pathologically enlarge dysfunctional nerve . Currently , effective therapy . To find medication help patient GAN , investigator conduct clinical trial . In study , investigator propose prepare future clinical trial invite GAN patient join research effort . The investigator examine regularly well understand disease . The visit include question , physical exam , blood drawing , lumbar puncture , skin biopsy . The visit also include test assess electrical conductivity patient ' nerve well test measure patient ' brain wave activity . In addition , investigator perform test evaluate patient ' motor function , vision , think ability . Identifying effective GAN treatment important currently none . Clinical trial way decide whether new treatment work GAN patient . With future objective conduct clinical trial GAN , propose project three specific aim . The first plan clinical trial develop reliable outcome measure , establish infrastructure need carry efficient clinical trial . The second characterize patient population clinical molecular point view , third aim utilize information gather study pre-clinical GAN drug development select candidate drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Giant Axonal Neuropathy ( GAN ) rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder appear childhood affect central peripheral nervous system . This disorder generally characterize motor sensory involvement include progressive predominant distal clumsiness , muscle weakness , pronounce gait disturbance . GAN cause various mutation GAN gene encodes protein gigaxonin . This lead giant axonal swell degeneration due substantial accumulation neurofilaments axon . Currently , effective therapy , onset occur age seven , death usually occur first third decade life .</detailed_description>
