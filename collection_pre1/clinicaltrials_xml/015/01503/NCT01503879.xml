	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation therapeutic method use order keep gas exchange adequate cell metabolism patient acute respiratory failure . It currently prove , although one hand use method keep gas exchange , hand promotes support pulmonary inflammatory process ( VILI ) . A recent study effect positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) DLCO ( diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ) patient undergo invasive mechanical ventilation prove patient without evident pulmonary disease ( negative medical history , negative chest clinical examination , normal chest X-ray radiography normal arterial oxygen tension [ PaO2 ] ) 24 hour invasive mechanical ventilation show significant worsen pulmonary gas exchange property . The author suppose worsening may cause early alteration alveolar-capillary membrane cause mechanical ventilation . This hypothesis find support study carry animal model found mechanical ventilation , even low tidal volume ( Vt ) set hour , able induce lung injury ( show histologic finding ) . The sensitive specific tool investigator currently rely study alveolar-capillary membrane measurement diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) evaluation plasmatic level pulmonary surfactant protein B ( SPB ) . DLCO standard , widely diffuse technique evaluation functional alteration alveolar-capillary membrane currently available also patient undergo invasive mechanical ventilation . SBP produce type II pneumocytes alveoli . An increase plasmatic level correlate decay pulmonary gas exchange ; SPB thus consider alveolar-capillary membrane anatomical damage marker . The primary end-point study evaluate change anatomical ( SPB ) functional ( DLCO ) feature alveolar-capillary membrane spontaneous breathe mechanical ventilation well progressive change affect DLCO SPB time general anaesthesia mechanical ventilation patient otherwise healthy lung undergo elective surgery . This order check time observe worsen alveolar-capillary membrane function , find process progressive time . The secondary end point check alteration functional feature alveolar membrane ( DLCO ) proportionate increase alveolar injury marker ( SPB ) , order understand worsen alveolar-capillary membrane function attributable anatomical damage physiologic change ventilation-perfusion matching .</brief_summary>
