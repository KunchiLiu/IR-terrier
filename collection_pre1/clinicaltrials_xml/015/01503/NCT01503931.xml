	<brief_summary>The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system key structure underlie addictive behaviour alcohol addiction control prefrontal glutamatergic neurotransmission . The aim present multicenter-study Berlin , Bonn Mannheim use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) alcohol addiction endophenotyping order study relevance genetic variation , particular dopaminergic glutamatergic gene , addiction . The investigator use temporal discounting cue reactivity paradigm alcoholic healthy control order 1 ) test impact genetic variation activation mesolimbic system population 2 ) test predictive effect treatment outcome alcoholic . The subproject thus bridge animal research genetically determine cue reactivity human study alcoholic . Furthermore , investigator link result measurement glutamate glutamine magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) subproject SP14 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol addiction one common neuropsychiatric disease today 's society . Chronic misuse alcohol cause significant physical psychological damage afflict individual , also represent serious social economic problem . Despite availability range psychological medical therapy , risk relapse dependent individual remain high even year abstinence . New , effective therapy urgently need . Approximately 50 % predisposition develop alcohol addiction genetically inherit . In order create improve treatment approach novel diagnostic tool , enhance knowledge genetic basis biology alcohol addiction prerequisite . The aim multi-centre study investigate genetic variation increase risk develop alcohol-addiction . To achieve , scientist Berlin , Bonn Mannheim examine specific brain mechanism play important role alcohol dependence . Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , technique make possible observe brain 'at work ' , use reveal brain mechanism affect alcohol addiction process reward punishment , behaviour control memory . It investigate gene gene-gene interaction underlie neuronal mechanism . This powerful approach potential uncover 'addiction-pathways ' gene affect personality , drink behaviour success stay abstinent via influence neuronal mechanism . A special emphasis project lie upon so-called 'reward system ' , process naturally rewarding stimulus ( e.g . food , sex ) , alcohol-dependent individual , change perception behaviours way become progressively focused alcohol . Two major neurotransmitter involve working reward system : 'dopamine ' indirectly 'glutamate ' . The project investigate dopaminergic glutamatergic gene influence neural mechanism reward processing , neural mechanism , personality , drink behaviour therapy success . In long run , knowledge might lead effective therapy development new medication . This large-scale study conduct several hundred alcohol-dependent patient non-dependent individual period five year .</detailed_description>
