	<brief_title>Biomarkers Exhaled Breath Condensates Acute Lung Injury : Early Detection Outcome Predictors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) lead cause mortality morbidity intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The cause ALI/ARDS differ patient patient , include sepsis , aspiration , systemic inflammation , trauma , blood transfusion , etc . With early detection treatment , survival rate may improve significantly . However , often difficult differentiate ALI/ARDS cardiogenic pulmonary edema cause , even advance technology invasive tool . A potential tool breath chemical test , range exhale gas measurement , exhale nitric oxide carbonic monoxide , volatile organic compound determination nonvolatile biomarker profiling . Being completely noninvasive , sample exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) allow clinician researcher assess body function easier flexible manner . Exhaled breath contain thousand volatile nonvolatile compound trace amount . Therefore , recently , development highly sensitive cutting-edge technology sample analysis , evaluation type human specimens becomes possible . Advanced technology proteomics , metabolomics , GC/LC-Mass Spectrometry pattern recognition computation generate field exhale biomarker profiling , call `` breathomics . '' After establishment metabolomic profiling EBC patient ALI , ARDS cardiogenic pulmonary edema , useful powerful noninvasive tool ALI/ARDS diagnosis outcome prediction could set . Metabolomics , metabonomics , large-scale approach monitor many possible compound involve cellular process single assay derive metabolic profile . Although metabolomics first refer monitor individual cell metabonomics refer multicellular organism , term often use interchangeably . Metabolic change occur number mechanism , include direct genetic regulation alteration enzymatic metabolic reaction . Metabolomics allow global assessment cellular state within context immediate environment , take account genetic regulation , alter kinetic activity enzyme , change metabolic reaction . Thus , compare genomics proteomics , metabolomics reflect change phenotype therefore function . Techniques apply metabolic profile include nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) mass spectrometry ( MS ) . Metabolomics advantage capable search protein metabolite blood urine . Metabolomics may useful understand metabolic imbalance diagnosis human disease . Over 30 endogenous metabolite study breast tissue , breast cancer show elevate total choline-containing compound ( tCho ) , low glycerophosphocholine , low glucose compare benign tumor healthy tissue . Similar breast cancer , prostate cancer exhibit distinct metabolic profile characterize high tCho phosphocholine level , along increase glycolytic product lactate alanine . In prostate cancer , citrate may also marker responsiveness treatment . These result show potential utility metabolomics cancer diagnosis clinical evaluation . Breath chemical test broad spectrum application range exhale nitric oxide fraction ( FeNO ) measurement monitor effect anti-inflammatory treatment asthma , volatile organic compound ( VOC ) determination nonvolatile biomarker profile cool breath sample call exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) . Being completely noninvasive , sample breath allows clinicians researcher assess different body function flexible manner . Therefore , breath testing consider potentially ideal candidate screening purpose . Besides widely know constituent nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide , inert gas water vapour , exhale breath also consist thousand volatile nonvolatile component , mainly trace amount , make detection challenge task . The use innovative `` -omics '' technology , include proteomics , metabolomics , mass spectromics , gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) ion mobility spectrometry , offer great potential field exhale biomarker profiling . Unlike bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) sputum induction involve inhalation hypertonic saline induce cough possibly bronchoconstriction , EBC influence airway function cause inflammation . It easily safely perform patient severe illness even allow repeat measurement take . As , relatively new field potential study perform investigate acute lung injury metabolomics .</detailed_description>
