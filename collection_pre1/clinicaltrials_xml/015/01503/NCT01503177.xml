	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial investigates side effect best dose local ( intrapleural measles virus therapy treating patient malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) . The investigator anticipate intrapleural vaccine strain measles virus enable virus specifically infect kill cancer cell spare , without damage normal cell . Furthermore , investigator expect measles virus trigger anti-tumor immune response result additional destruction tumor immune cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intrapleural administration modify vaccine strain measles virus ( MV ) genetically engineer produce human thyroidal sodium iodine symporter ( NIS ) ( MV-NIS [ oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter ] ) patient MPM . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Safety toxicity repeat ( 6 cycle ) intrapleural administration MV-NIS patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time course viral infection , dissemination elimination non-invasive measurement NIS gene expression use radioactive iodine single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) / compute tomography ( CT ) imaging . II . Viremia , viral replication , viral shed follow intrapleural administration . III . Changes humoral cellular anti-MV immunity follow intrapleural administration MV-NIS . IV . Antitumor efficacy approach serial measurement radioiodine uptake SPECT/CT , radiographic response , time disease progression . V. Changes local systemic innate adaptive anti-tumor immunity follow intrapleural administration MV-NIS . VI . Effect MV-NIS administration eukaryotic initiation factor ( eIF ) 4F translation complex mesothelioma cell . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter ( MV-NIS ) intrapleurally . In absence unacceptable side effect disease progression treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
