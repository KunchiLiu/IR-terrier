	<brief_title>Biomarkers Exhaled Breath Condensates Septic Patients Predict Development Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose project , focus identification potential biomarkers EBC ability predict development multi-organ failure . Currently , tool could use evaluate effect mitochondrial dysfunction sepsis . All human study discuss mitochondrial dysfunction sepsis use tissue biopsy study material . Repeated tissue biopsy invasive applicable . EBC could collect non-invasively conveniently . A study demonstrate use metabolomic technology mitochondrial disease . We believe metabolomic biomarkers EBC could use demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction lung respiratory tract septic patient . Such metabolomic biomarkers may also reflect similar on-going mitochondrial dysfunction organ system , could potentially become novel diagnostic tool therapeutic target future sepsis therapy .</detailed_description>
