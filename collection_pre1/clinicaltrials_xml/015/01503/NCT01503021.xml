	<brief_title>Safety Study Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate ( SFP ) Dialysate CKD Patients Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parent Study : randomize , double-blinded , crossover , 6 week , 700 patient . Patients randomize receive SFP 2 µmoles ( 110 µg ) iron/L dialysate liquid bicarbonate concentrate placebo ( standard liquid bicarbonate concentrate ) x 2 week , 1 week washout , crossed alternate treatment x 2 week . Extension Study : open-label , single active arm , uncontrolled study , 53 week , 300 patient . Following completion RMTI-SFP-6 parent study , patient could enter extension study , receive SFP 2 µmoles ( 110 µg ) iron/L dialysate liquid bicarbonate concentrate 52 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parent Study , Double Blinded , Crossover : Key 1 . Adult ≥ 18 year age . 2 . Has chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) receive maintenance hemodialysis ( HD ) ( CKDHD subject ) regularly undergo 2 dialysis session per week . 3 . Stable predialysis Hgb ≥ 9.0 ≤ 12.5 g/dL . 4 . Stable predialysis TSAT ≥ 15 % ≤ 45 % . 5 . Stable predialysis ferritin ≥ 100 ≤ 1200 µg/L ( 1200 ng/mL ) . Key 1 . Any previous exposure SFP . 2 . Therapy intravenous , intramuscular oral iron time first/screening visit randomization visit , anticipate requirement iron supplementation study period . 3 . Nontunneled vascular catheter dialysis . 4 . Scheduled kidney transplant within next 8 week . 5 . Active infection require systemic antimicrobial antifungal therapy within 2 week prior screen , screen period prior randomization . 6 . Hospitalization within 1 month prior screen ( except vascular access surgery ) . Extension Study , Open Label , Single Active Arm : Key 1 .
