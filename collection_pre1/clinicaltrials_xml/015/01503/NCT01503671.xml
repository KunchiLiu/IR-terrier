	<brief_summary>Background Heart failure final consequence various heart disease also lead cause mortality worldwide . Diastolic dysfunction refers abnormality diastolic distensibility , filling , relaxation leave ventricle . Patients hypertensive leave ventricular hypertrophy echocardiogram showing normal ejection fraction abnormal leave ventricular filling say diastolic dysfunction . If pulmonary edema effort dyspnea develop patient . The term diastolic heart failure would appropriate . Pathology lead diastolic heart failure include : impaired relaxation , increase passive stiffness , endocardial pericardial disorder , microvascular flow neurohormonal regulation . Among , association pro-inflammatory system diastolic dysfunction already establish . The investigator therefore hypothesize change serum inflammatory marker might associate change leave ventricular diastolic function investigator thus conduct randomized case-control trial regard . Method material This case-control randomize study . The definition leave ventricular diastolic function accord Guideline ACC AHA . The investigator evaluate leave ventricular diastolic function noninvasively echocardiography intervention . Exclusion criterion include coronary artery disease , significant valvular heart disease , cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease renal insufficiency . The investigator would like enroll 50 case number control . The inclusion criterion subject underwent peritoneal dialysis investigator hospital 6 month high pro-inflammation serum cytokine level ( C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL ) . Atorvastatin ( 40mg/day ) would give allocated intervention group . The investigator follow cardiac diastolic function echocardiography also change serum marker . The investigator would also genotype inflammation-associated gene promoter region find association genetic polymorphism treatment effect statin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We evaluate leave ventricular diastolic function noninvasively echocardiography intervention . Exclusion criterion include coronary artery disease , significant valvular heart disease , cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease renal insufficiency . We would like enroll 50 case number control . The inclusion criterion subject underwent peritoneal dialysis hospital 6 month high pro-inflammation serum cytokine level ( C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL ) . Atorvastatin ( 40mg/day ) would give allocated intervention group . We follow cardiac diastolic function echocardiography also change serum marker . We would also genotype inflammation-associated gene promoter region find association genetic polymorphism treatment effect statin . Patients population Monitoring The study population consist patient CAPD DHF ( NYHA Class II-IV ) , age 18 year old without reduce systolic function , define leave ventricular EF ≤ 45 % , Patients fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 ratio study single medical center . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Outpatients ≥ 20 year age , male female essential hypertension 2 . Patients must stable condition CAPD least 6 month . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . History hypersensitivity study drug . 2 . Current acute decompensated HF ( exacerbation chronic HF manifest sign &amp; symptom may require IV therapy ) . 3 . Acute coronary syndrome , stroke , transient ischemic attack , cardiac , carotid major vascular surgery , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) carotid angioplasty , within past 3 month prior visit 1 . 4 . Coronary carotid artery disease likely require surgical percutaneous intervention within 6 month Visit 1 . 5 . Right heart failure due severe pulmonary disease . 6 . Diagnosis peripartum chemotherapy induce cardiomyopathy within 12 month prior visit 1 . 7 . Patients history heart transplant transplant list leave ventricular assistance device ( LVAD device ) . 8 . Documented ventricular arrhythmia syncopal episode within past 3 month , prior visit 1 , untreated . 9 . Symptomatic bradycardia second third degree heart block without pacemaker . 10 . Implantation CRT ( cardiac resynchronization therapy ) device within prior 3 month visit 1 intent implant CRT device . 11 . Presence hemodynamically significant mitral and/or aortic valve disease , except mitral regurgitation secondary leave ventricular dilatation . 12 . Presence hemodynamically significant obstructive lesion leave ventricular outflow tract , include aortic sub-aortic stenosis . 13 . Severe primary pulmonary , renal hepatic disease judge physician . 14 . Presence disease life expectancy &lt; 1 year . 15 . Chronic long-term requirement NSAIDs ( high dose ) COX2 inhibitor , exception aspirin dos use CV prophylaxis ( ≤325 mg o.d. ) . 16 . Subjects breast feeding , get pregnant pregnant within 6 month .</detailed_description>
