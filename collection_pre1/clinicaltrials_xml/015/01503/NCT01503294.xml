	<brief_summary>Assessment evaluation body temperature important sign health disease . Inferior thermometry increase risk morbidity mortality , increase health care cost delay diagnosis treatment fever-related disease . The gold standard measure core body temperature pulmonary artery thermistor ( PAT ) . The measurement PAT require insertion invasive pulmonary artery catheter , high risk procedure . An innovative thermometry technology , temporal artery thermometer ( TAT ) , introduce clinical arena potential non-invasive proxy PAT . The TAT reduces risk cost pulmonary artery catheter insertion non-invasively measure core blood temperature measure temperature skin temporal artery . Research demonstrate precision accuracy TAT normothermic patient publish , little data available temperature great 100.4oF . The purpose study measure precision accuracy 2standard care temperature method : thermistor PAT , consider gold standard , TAT measure patient PAT temperature great 100.4oF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Temporal Pulmonary Artery Temperature Measurement Patients With Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The result previous study agree direct comparison PAT TAT clinically comparable normal temperature range adult . This defined clinical significance difference less ±.5ºC ( .9ºF . In one study assess subject fever ( temperature great 37.8oC ( 100.0oF ) methodological criticism , compare TAT PAT adult ( n=15 ) . There poor correlation ( r=0.3 ) among adult measurement difference 1.3+0.6o C. Eighty-nine percent TAT measurement different PAT ±.5ºC . With one study focus PAT outside normal temperature range evaluate accuracy precision , need research ass accuracy precision TAT detection hyperthermia . A new onset temperature equal 100.4oF define fever temperature 100.9oF consider reasonable trigger clinical assessment accord Society Critical Care Medicine fever guideline adult . Researchers synthesize literature TAT noninvasive temperature measurement , indicate noninvasive temperature measurement accurate normal temperature may fail detect hyperthermia hypothermia , depend thermometer use . The author conclude TAT clinically comparable PAT normal temperature range . A repeated measure design use describe accuracy precision 2 temperature measurement , PAT TAT . Study subject act control order investigate difference PAT reading TAT reading core oral mode . The PAT also compare TAT read take clinical staff .</detailed_description>
