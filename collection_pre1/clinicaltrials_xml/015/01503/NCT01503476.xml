	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : This study design integral part development new improve feature component Bravo® pH Monitoring System may serve verification validation purpose The study population include group healthy volunteer ( Group A ) group symptomatic patient know suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease ( Group B ) . Group A : Healthy volunteer undergo invasive procedure . These volunteer may ask carry capsule and\or Bravo Recorder . These procedure serve evaluate different technical matter human interface , ergonomic aspect communication performance system Group B : Symptomatic patient undergo invasive procedure , include Bravo capsule delivery , position attachment . Confirmation capsule attachment may do endoscopically . These procedure serve evaluate overall system performance actual clinical setup , instance : Bravo Recorder performance include communication quality , human interface similar , ergonomics delivery device , pH Capsule performance , etc . Subjects study group well physician may ask provide feedback procedure and/or document activity procedure .</brief_summary>
