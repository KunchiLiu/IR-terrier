	<brief_title>Computer Training Program Younger Patients With Brain Tumor Who Underwent Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility home-based , computerized , cognitive training program patient pediatric brain tumor undergo cranial radiation therapy ( CRT ) , treat multiple Children Oncology Group ( COG ) institution . II . To estimate effect size program measure attention work memory patient brain tumor treat CRT order design definitive large-scale clinical trial . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk factor , include age ( &lt; 8 year vs ≥ 8 year ) treatment intensity ( whole brain vs focal radiation ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . ARM I ( intervention ) : Patients undergo home-based , computerized , interactive training program comprise 3-5 session 15-45 minute every week 5-9 week . The program contain twelve visually engage interest exercise target skill involve visual-spatial verbal work memory ( WM ) . The program adaptive way difficulty task automatically adjust trial-by-trail basis match patient 's current WM . Each patient interventional coach online access patient 's training session outcome ( pas fail ) . Coaches able modify training sequence make suggestion patient and/or parent progress maximize . Coaches also telephone meeting patient and/or family week ensure compliance , track progress , provide feedback , answer question arise training . ARM II ( control ) : Patients undergo home-based , computerized , interactive , non-adaptive training program comprise 3-5 session 15-45 minute week 5-9 week . Each patient also interventional coach arm I . Patients arms complete brief neuropsychological/behavioral assessment comprise Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children ( WIS-IV ) , Children 's Memory Scale ( CMS ) , California Verbal Learning Test-Children 's Version ( CVLT-C ) baseline , completion study , 6 month completion study . Additionally , parent complete parent-report questionnaire gather information patient 's behavior , thought , emotion , adaptive skill , social functional impairment . Parents child also complete survey program regard technical feasibility , adherence , ease-of-use , satisfaction .</detailed_description>
