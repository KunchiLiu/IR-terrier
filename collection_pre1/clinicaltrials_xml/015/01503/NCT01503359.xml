	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dietary supplement sarcosine effective treatment schizophrenia . The investigator assess impact sarcosine quality life sexual functioning . In project investigator also measure glycine , sarcosine , BDNF , MMP-9 level oxydative stress parameter blood , brain glutamatergic metabolism parameter magnetic resonance spectroscopy oculomotoric change electrooculography .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glutamic acid large excitatory neurotransmitter central nervous system , population glutamatergic neurones represent approximately 50 % neurones brain . Being closely dependent inhibitory GABA system , glutamate system responsible transmission modulation majority brain signal connect dopaminergic serotonergic system . The glutamate system play important role pathogenesis schizophrenia . NMDA receptor antagonist , include phencyclidine , ketamine MK-801 , cause symptom similar find schizophrenia , well deterioration mental state patient schizophrenia . What important theoretical point view NMDA agonists also cause negative symptom observe amphetamine drug intoxication . Based observation , assume normalization glutamatergic transmission may result improvement schizophrenia symptomatology . According assumption hypothesis , attempt make stimulate transmission within system . Due high risk excitotoxic effect induction therapy glutamic acid administer ( hyperactivity glutamatergic system , lead nerve cell damage observe neurodegenerative disease ) . Along glutamic acid voltage change dependent another glutamatergic receptor - AMPA , presence glycine necessary stimulate NMDA receptor . This widely distribute amino acid , important element protein chain , present daily diet ( average consumption amount 2g/day ) . In addition building property , paramount importance central nervous system . As primary transmitter glycinergic neurones belongs class I neurotransmitter . Moreover , also play role co-agonist modulator , example glutamatergic system . Glutamic acid release nerve ending synaptic cleft , re-uptaken disperse , , consequence , result rapid decline concentration vicinity NMDA receptor . As result , time receptor bind short . Intrasynaptic glycine turnover different - resides inside synapsis permanently , depend concentration , great lesser extent , bind modulatory site . Glial cell , identify glycine transport system ( GlyT-1 ) responsible maintain stable level glycine neuronal junction . New research inhibitor transport system ( GTI ) eg . sarcosine , may similar good effect glycine administration , begin . Glycine bind modulatory site NMDA receptor vivo , augmentation saturation intensifies glutamatergic transmission . This phenomenon particularly observed individual relatively low ( sufficient maximum saturation receptor site ) level synaptic glycine . We hypothesize supplementation sarcosine help achieve betterment symptomatology , general quality life also cognitive function prefrontal derivative , eg . oculomotor function . To extend research plan assess blood level glycine , sarcosine also parameters involved glutamatergic transmission BDNF metalproteinase MMP-9 . Knowing excitotoxic property glutamate TBARS ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ) - oxidative stress relate assess . Methodology study . We plan enroll 60-70 patient stable mental state meeting criterion schizophrenia accord ICD-10 predominant negative symptom ( minimum 21 point severity negative symptom least 3 point PANSS-Negative subscale ) . Main study part continue 26 week ( T0-T26 ) 10 visit ( W1-W10 ) . The precede 12-week period ( W0-W1 ) use evaluation stability mental state pharmacotherapy . Patients visit T0 randomize two comparable group 30 patient ( sarcosine control group ) . Researchers patient information administer treatment . During study patient receive previous antipsychotic treatment ( least 3-month without dosage change ) . Mental stability assess preceding period ( W1 W0 visit - 12 week W1 ) . Sarcosine ( placebo ) augment visit W1 W9 , subsequent period ( W9 W10 ) , use evaluate consequence withdrawal sarcosine ( placebo ) . Information history disease , current mental status obtain psychiatric examination , part , standardize use commonly accept psychiatric scale ( PANSS , Calgary Depression Scale , CGI , SAS quality life sexual activity scale ) . Assessment use psychiatric scale use visit . As basic tool use study cognitive function test Wisconsin Card Sorting ( WCST ) , Trail Making Test ( TMT ) Stroop Test use . Psychological testing perform psychologist visit W1 , W6 W9 . Assessment metabolism glycine glutamic acid brain tissue frontal cortex hippocampus use magnetic resonance spectroscopy , electrooculography , parameter oxidative stress - T-BARS blood assessment ( glycine , sarcosine , BDNF MMP-9 ) perform visit W1 W9 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis schizophrenia ( ICD10 ) Other criterion relate diagnosis verify selection visit : The score PANSS negative symptom subscale â‰¥ 21 , Severity individual symptom PANSS positive symptom subscale may exceed 3 point . General lack write informed consent , risk noncompliance study period , patient assess throughout study period ( eg . due travel vacation ) , pregnancy breastfeeding , woman childbearing potential use effective contraception ( ie . birth control pill , surgical sterilization , hormonal contraceptive injection , IUD , contraceptive implant , patch , condom ) , participation another clinical study , currently within 3 month visit selection panel patient previously subject selection study . Medical Therapeutic Criteria Associated schizophrenia patient acute psychosis , severe symptom productive , patient take clozapine , declare suicidal tendency , history commit suicide past year . Associated psychiatric disorder patient currently meet criterion ICD10 diagnosis mental disorder schizophrenia ( last 6 month visit selection ) , confirm MINI questionnaire patient show prevalent / severe symptom depression ( even without meet criterion major depressive episode accord ICD10 criterion ) , patient ever diagnose lifetime bipolar disorder , patient severe personality disorder , particularly type antisocial , borderline , histrionicznego could affect assessment test result . Other abuse addiction alcohol psychoactive substance ( exclude nicotine ) within last 6 month , accord criterion ICD10 , confirm MINI questionnaire , disturbance occur form somatic accord ICD10 criterion , Delirium dementia accord ICD10 criterion , current diagnosis neurological disease ( eg , stroke , seizure , migraine , multiple sclerosis ) , liver failure ( ie , cirrhosis active liver disease ) , diagnose acute chronic hepatitis , severe uncontrolled somatic disease could affect course study ( eg cancer , cardiovascular , respiratory , metabolic oral , severe renal failure , unstable diabetes type I II , morbid obesity , untreated uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant blood ) , thyroid dysfunction ( especially hypothyroidism ) untreated uncontrolled , T thyroid hormone treatment start , terminate modified 3 month selection visit , hormone replacement therapy start , terminate modified 3 month selection visit . recognize disorder hemostasis , Associated prior concomitant treatment Particular caution maintain use drug likely affect central nervous system mechanism action could affect course study .
