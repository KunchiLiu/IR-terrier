	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This research study study biomarkers tumor tissue blood sample patient small cell lung cancer register CALGB-140202 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers Tumor Tissue Blood Samples From Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Registered CALGB-140202</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify major genetic alteration human small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) use next-generation sequence focus mutation cod sequence . Secondary - To follow in-depth assessment candidate oncogene tumor suppressor gene use gene expression analysis , cell culture system , murine model SCLC . OUTLINE : DNA isolate archived tumor tissue blood sample analyze genetic mutation gene expression profile use Illumina exome sequencing . Results compare transcriptome tumor ( cell line ) without specific mutation . Cell culture study overexpressing inhibit gene interest also perform mouse model identify potential driver small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
