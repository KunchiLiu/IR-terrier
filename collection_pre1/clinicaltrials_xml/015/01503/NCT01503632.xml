	<brief_title>Assessing Compliance With Mercaptopurine Treatment Younger Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia First Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine impact intervention propose intervention program ( IP ) vs. education alone ( EDU ) adherence oral 6MP ( mercaptopurine ) child acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . Adherence measure : ) Medication Event Monitoring Systems ( MEMS ) ( primary measure adherence oral 6MP , provide real-time data ; ii ) red cell thioguanine nucleotide ( TGN ) level ( provide data chronic , systemic 6MP exposure ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine modify effect sociodemographic psychosocial variable , mediate effect health beliefs/ knowledge change adherence intervention . II . Determine impact IP vs. EDU risk relapse ALL . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . ARM I : Patients receive Patients Supply Kit contain electronic pill monitor system , MEMS® medication bottle TrackCap™ standard resistant cap , write instruction patient pharmacist . Parents and/or caregiver also train supervise patient ' intake medication . Beginning day 1 , patient start use MEMS® medication bottle TrackCap™ . Clinical research assistant contact patient parent telephone next day confirm TrackCap™ use , identify obstacle , determine solution . Beginning day 29 , patient caregiver view interactive multimedia educational program on-line via DVD . Patients also receive customize electronic mercaptopurine schedule automate customized text message reminder deliver via cellular phone web-based interface . Patients caregiver instruct return MEMS® medication bottle TrackCap™ clinic day 141 . ARM II : Patients receive usual standard care mercaptopurine MEMS® medication bottle TrackCap™ patient arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year annually 10 year diagnosis .</detailed_description>
