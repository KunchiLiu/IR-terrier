	<brief_summary>Dural lumbar puncture ( LP ) , pass needle space spinal cord , common procedure everyday clinical practice . The common use LP measure spinal fluid pressure sample spinal fluid laboratory analysis . However , also use therapeutic purpose , administer chemotherapy spinal anesthesia . A notorious side effect dural puncture headache range mild debilitating may last several day follow procedure . Among diagnosed patient , 39 % experience least 1 week impaired ability perform activity daily live . The likelihood develop headache dural puncture depend number factor . As fluid leak assume culprit mechanism headache strategy minimize leak seem offer best path lower incidence headache diagnostic LP , common clinical context dural puncture medical practice . Lumbar puncture highly stressful event patient . As pain anxiety cause adrenergic stimulation , also cause increase ICP . We believe mild increase ICP , occur puncture well puncture may exacerbate pressure difference CSF space epidural space worsen CSF leak Furthermore , excess pressure , although mild , might cause dural puncture hole widen slightly augment leak possibly even prolong . Furthermore , anticipation pain cause rise neurotransmitter may cause sensitization effect worsen pain . This increase adrenergic drive well sensitization pain effectively blunt periprocedural use mild IV sedation . Benzodiazepines , sedative-hypnotic quality well suit task . This study aim test effect mild peri-procedural IV sedation use Midazolam rate headache diagnostic LP . Patients undergoing diagnostic LP randomize two group . Group 1 undergo procedure routinely practice . Group 2 give Midazolam IV 10-5 minute prior procedure undergo diagnostic procedure . All patient study remain observation hospital least 6 hour . Patients evaluate headache specifically headache . Clinical follow continue 72 hour administer short questionnaire telephone .</brief_summary>
