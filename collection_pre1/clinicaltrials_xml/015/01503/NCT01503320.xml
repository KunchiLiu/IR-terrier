	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) potentially serious illness characterize inflammation pancreas variable involvement peri-pancreatic tissue and/ remote organ system . AP contribute thousand annual hospital admission , severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) account 10-20 % . The course SAP tend prolonged patient usually hyper metabolic high protein catabolic due systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) induce acute local inflammatory process subsequent vital organ dysfunction . There currently specific proven treatment . Therefore , current therapy AP direct intensive medical care , nutrition support , infection control medicine administration . Nutritional support play important role management patient SAP , critical complex . Thus , nutritional support appropriately administer match rapidly increase demand treatment SAP , patient consequently come gross metabolic imbalance nutrition deficiency . This consider increase mortality due impair immune function , increase risk infection intractable vital- organ failure . Despite recently report encouraging result early enteral feeding patient acute pancreatitis , total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) still frequently perform management patient AP . However , long period TPN know associate mucosal atrophy increase gastrointestinal permeability , two establish risk factor endotoxemia bacteriemia . Artificial nutrition prevent complication provide long term nutritional support SAP patient . Enteral nutrition prefer parenteral nutrition improve patient outcome largely replace parenteral route . Early nasogastric enteral nutrition ( NGEN ) consider potentially lead pancreatic-unrest thereby prove harmful early acute phase AP . However , Eatock et al introduce early nasogastric feed nutritional management SAP Pandey et al apply oral re-feeding patient SAP , suggest nasogastric feed feasible 80 % case . A meta-analysis recent randomize control trial show early NGEN would effective safe early Naso Jejunal enteral nutrition ( NJEN ) TPN SAP patient , without increase mortality pain re-feeding . EN could preserve intestinal permeability , proven assessment excretion polyethylene glycol antiendotoxin core antibody IgM level , would best barrier prevention certain complication . Serum interleukin-6 level elevate early patient necrosis infection C-reactive protein ( CRP ) consider valuable independent predictor mortality . IL-6 CRP level play similar role control systematic inflammatory response early EN TPN group time point . Moreover , biochemical/ nutritional parameter serum albumin prealbumin concentration early EN well preserve without significant difference . Glutamine abundant free amino acid body . When nutritional deficiency arise critical illness include SAP , glutamine , readily synthesize situation , tend conditionally deplete . The low concentration plasma glutamine find independent predictive factor poor outcome critical illness . Glutamine use major fuel nucleotide substrate rapidly divide cell intestinal mucosal cell gut-associated immunocytes . Glutamine prevent atrophy intestinal epithelial cell HSP 70 generation improve intestinal immune barrier . A meta-analysis Novak et al reveal glutamine could reduce infectious morbidity ( RR 0.84 , 95 % CI : 0.68-1.03 ) mortality ( RR 0.76 , 95 % CI : 0.56-0.98 ) critical illness . Standard TPN contain glutamine . Parenteral nutrition supplement glutamine show beneficial effect preservation intestinal integrity , improve lymphocyte function improve antioxidant capacity compare standard TPN ; glutamine administration relate clinically significant decrease morbidity mortality . We hypothesize enteral glutamine supplementation patient severe predict severe acute pancreatitis help early recovery prevention adverse outcome . In study , aim evaluate therapeutic effect enteral glutamine clinical outcome , gut permeability , systemic inflammation , oxidative stress plasma glutamine level .</detailed_description>
