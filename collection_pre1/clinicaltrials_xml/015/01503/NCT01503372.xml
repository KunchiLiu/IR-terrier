	<brief_summary>The prognosis advance gastric cancer adenocarcinoma gastro-esophageal ( GE ) junction poor . Even modern chemotherapy median survival range around 8-10 month . Inhibition neoangiogenesis seem promising approach gastric cancer . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) act one potent stimulate agent angiogenesis , several strategy target VEGF signal pathway develop , include anti-VEGF antibody , soluble receptor bind directly VEGF ligand , anti-VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) antibodies VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . The breakthrough clinical development anti-angiogenic therapy colorectal cancer come 2003 large prospective , randomized clinical trial bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody direct VEGF . Anti-angiogenic therapy introduce highly effective , completely new mode action area new standard care advanced colorectal cancer . The concept VEGF inhibition also promise gastric cancer . Bevacizumab investigated combination irinotecan cisplatin phase-II trial , include 47 patient gastric GE-junction carcinoma . Bevacizumab could safely give could improve time tumor progression 75 % compare historical control . Several phase-II trial confirm tolerability promise efficacy bevacizumab gastric cancer ( Bevacizumab + Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin ; FOLFOX + Bevacizumab ; Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Irinotecan + Bevacizumab ) . These result promise randomized phase-III trial 1st-line perioperative set way ( AVAGAST-trial : Cisplatin /Capecitabine +/- bevacizumab 1st line ; MAGIC-B-trial : ECX +/- bevacizumab perioperative ) . Tyrosin kinase inhibitor inhibit VEGF receptor EGFR also investigate gastric cancer promise efficacy . Pazopanib , orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor , selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , -2 -3 , c-kit platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGF-R ) , result inhibition angiogenesis tumor receptor upregulated . Pazopanib advantage orally available anti-angiogenesis component . Pazopanib show promising activity phase-II trial renal cell cancer , breast cancer , soft tissue sarcoma non small cell lung cancer . A phase-III trial pazopanib renal cell cancer ( NCT00334282 ) complete result approval Pazopanib disease . A phase-III trial soft tissue sarcoma ( NCT00753688 ) currently perform . In phase-I trial , pazopanib investigate combination FOLFOX Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin . FOLFOX could administer full dose 800 mg pazopanib . In Cape/Ox , capecitabine reduce 850mg/m² bd . 5-FU- oxaliplatin-based regimen one establish treatment standard 1st-line therapy metastatic gastric cancer . The efficacy 5-FU , leukovorin oxaliplatin ( FLO ) compare 5-FU , cisplatin could confirm randomized phase-III trial Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie ( AIO ) . FLO favorable toxicity profile . In Germany , FLO widely use combination advance gastric cancer recommend regimen new German S3-guidelines 2011 . The investigator therefore want examine FLO + pazopanib .</brief_summary>
