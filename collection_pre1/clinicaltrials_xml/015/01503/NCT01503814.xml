	<brief_title>Simplified Cardiovascular Management Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity , mortality , disability develop , also develop country . There well-established intervention lifestyle modification drug therapy , i.e. , aspirin low-dose diuretic , along consistent use , help alleviate burden practicality deliver care large number resource-poor setting low cost resolve . One particular cost-effective approach secondary prevention CVD identify manage individual high CVD risk order prevent delay event . This approach test rural Andhra Pradesh Cardiovascular Prevention Study India currently implement rural area northern China China Rural Health Initiative fund NHLBI . This project aim address highly prevalent problem CVD even remote poor area China India receive minimal attention far , specifically Tibet , China Haryana , India . This pilot project cluster-randomized control interventional trial include total 15 village 6 township Gongbujiangda County 12 village 6 township Linzhou County Tibet , China 12 village state Haryana India . The study last one year . The village randomize receive either intervention package usual care . At baseline , village-wide screening do identify high-risk individual select village follow throughout study one year . The interventional model make use highly simplify cardiovascular disease management plan target lifestyle modification utilization basic drug regimen help overcome barrier prevention management CVD area extremely limited economic natural resource , minimal public awareness problem , lack train healthcare professional . Electronic blood pressure monitor use village measure blood pressure individual . However accuracy electronic blood pressure monitor measurement need consider due Tibet 's high altitude . A study validate calibrate select blood pressure monitor model plain high altitude area thus undertake use validation procedure publish European Society Hypertension ( ESH ) ensure accuracy .</detailed_description>
