	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea affect approximately 2-4 % middle-aged adult general population associate several medical condition include hypertension coronary artery . Research last decade show obstructive sleep apnea may also increase propensity insulin resistance , glucose intolerance , type 2 diabetes mellitus . Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) first line therapy treatment obstructive sleep apnea . While PAP therapy several favorable effect improvement daytime sleepiness quality life , clear whether use PAP therapy alter metabolic risk . The overall objective study examine whether treatment obstructive sleep apnea positive airway pressure therapy improve glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity . The primary hypothesis study PAP therapy obstructive sleep apnea improve insulin sensitivity glucose metabolism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus one prevalent medical condition , affect stagger 246 million people worldwide . Obstructive sleep apnea relatively common often undiagnosed condition general population . Cross-sectional study clinic population-based sample suggest 40 % patient obstructive sleep apnea type 2 diabetes 75 % patient type 2 diabetes obstructive sleep apnea . There increase evidence pathophysiological feature intermittent hypoxia sleep fragmentation may responsible alter glucose homeostasis worsen insulin sensitivity . The mechanisms obstructive sleep apnea impairs glucose metabolism largely unknown . While intermittent hypoxemia sleep fragmentation likely play essential role , relative contribution causal pathway remain determined . Moreover , whether adverse effect intermittent hypoxia sleep fragmentation mediate increase sympathetic nervous system activity , alteration corticotropic function , and/or systemic inflammation know . Furthermore , remain determined whether positive pressure therapy obstructive sleep apnea salutary effect glucose metabolism . Many available study examine effect PAP glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity plague small sample size , lack control group , limit data compliance positive pressure therapy . The current study ass , use community-based sample , whether treatment obstructive sleep apnea positive pressure therapy improve insulin sensitivity , assess frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( primary outcome measure ) .</detailed_description>
