	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis formation new blood vessel exist vascular bed . Certain integrins upregulated angiogenesis myocardial fibrogenesis . Therefore , target integrin imaging agent potentially useful early diagnosis angiogenesis and/or fibrogenesis malignant process myocardial remodelling . Trail design Arm 1 : Study cohort include 30 patient . After IV injection 630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692 breast image CC oblique view use MBI system . Scintigarphic finding correlate tissue diagnosis or/ image clinical follow- least 6 month well MRI , perform , order determine PPV NPV technology MBI label NC100692 detection tumor differentiate benign malignant breast lesion . Arm 2 : Study cohort include 30 patient breast cancer refer 18-FDG PET-CT stag re-staging . In addition PET-CT study , scintimammography use MBI system whole-body scintigraphy use Infinia gamma-camera perform IV injection 630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692 . Imaging 99mTc-NC100692 take place first follow 18-FDG PET-CT , day . Detection primary tumor , lymph node remote metastasis various modality tracer correlate . Arm 3 : Study cohort include 15 patient locally advance breast cancer . Patients undergo scintimammography MBI system ( breast ) SPECT axilla thorax ( regional lymph node ) Infinia gamma camera , IV injection 630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692 prior treatment end . The result follow-up study correlate histological finding patient refer surgery MRI others . Prior exam , patient answer detailed questionnaire medical family history , finding image modality , therpy . The patient guide study coordinator answer questionnaire Reading 99mTc-NC100692 study blind mode image data , separately two nuclear medicine expert consensus . Mammography , US MRI review breast imaging .</detailed_description>
