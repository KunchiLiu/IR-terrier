	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine magnitude tissue testosterone suppression abiraterone acetate metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) ( resistant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [ LHRH ] agonist orchiectomy Â± antiandrogen ) one month treatment establish tissue base mechanism action . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability abiraterone acetate suppress tumor testosterone 12 week treatment . II . To determine tissue testosterone metastasis time progression abiraterone acetate treatment . III . To determine response dose escalation abiraterone acetate clinical progression . IV . To determine potential mechanism resistance abiraterone acetate analyze pharmacokinetics clinical progression , tissue androgen level baseline radiographic progression , evaluate wild type splice variant androgen receptor ( AR ) level baseline time progression complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarray progression . V. To determine micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) acquire peripheral blood reflect molecular change tumor metastases potential biomarker mechanism sensitivity resistance . VI . To evaluate pharmacokinetics dose escalate abiraterone ( abiraterone acetate ) 1000 mg twice daily . OUTLINE : Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) prednisone PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
