	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study best way give abiraterone acetate treat patient castration-resistant prostate cancer . Abiraterone acetate effective treat castrate resistant prostate cancer take fast state . However , body 's absorption abiraterone increase food intake . This study test whether low dose abiraterone take food similar effect prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) compare full dose take fasting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Food Effect Study Abiraterone Acetate Treatment Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare pharmacodynamic effect reduce dose ( 250mg daily ) abiraterone acetate prandial state ( 250mg-Fed ) full , standard 1000mg daily dose fast state ( 1000mg-Fasting ) assess change serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect prandial state plasma level intra-patient pharmacokinetic variability abiraterone acetate . II . To evaluate safety profile reduce dose abiraterone acetate take prandial state . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect reduce dose abiraterone acetate prandial state assess reduction extra-gonadal androgen dihydroepiadrosterone sulfate ( DHEA-S ) dihydroepiandrostenedione ( DHEA ) . IV . To evaluate effect prandial state time disease progression ( Working group criterion ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) daily first thing morning overnight fast least 8 hour . ARM II : Patients receive abiraterone acetate PO daily within 30 minute conventional low-fat breakfast . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Both arm also treat prednisone 5mg twice daily . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 30 day .</detailed_description>
