	<detailed_description>HIV-infected people increase inflammation body organ , even take anti-HIV medicine . Inflammation normal body reaction infection . However , inflammation last long time like HIV infection , may lead complication , heart disease , cancer , liver disease , problem think . Also , HIV-infected people high inflammation lower CD4+ T-cell count ( cell fight infection ) . Many HIV researcher study harmful effect prolong inflammation possible way prevent complication . The increase inflammation HIV-infected people may cause HIV factor part bacteria . These bacterial piece , call endotoxin , cause harm intestine ( gut ) . However , HIV infection , damage gut allow endotoxins cross gut blood . These endotoxin cause inflammation body . New research focus strategy reduce level endotoxin way decrease inflammation . A drug call sevelamer carbonate use bind phosphate dialysis patient . However , sevelamer carbonate also bind endotoxin gut lower endotoxin level blood dialysis patient . Sevelamer carbonate also decrease inflammation endotoxin cause dialysis patient . This study see sevelamer carbonate effect HIV-infected patient . A5296 phase II , single-arm study evaluate effect 8 week sevelamer carbonate administration marker microbial translocation well monocyte T-cell activation blood chronically HIV-infected subject CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 400 cells/mm3 receive ART . This study enrol 40 subject . To assess whether persistent effect study drug , subject observed additional 8 week sevelamer carbonate change biomarkers monitor . As A5296 phase II study biologic activity , primary secondary analysis as-treated , limited subject data baseline week 8 remain study treatment week 8 . For subject initiated antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) , analyse include data collect prior time ART start .</detailed_description>
