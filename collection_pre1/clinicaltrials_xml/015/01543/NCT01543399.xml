	<brief_summary>The interruption secretion sex steroid occur menopause , cause change vascular pattern various level . As result , several agency side effect interfere woman 's health . The use hormone replacement therapy contribute improvement effect . In previous study investigator show effect sex steroid premenopausal woman conjugate equine estrogen , medroxyprogesterone acetate tibolone menopausal woman , central retinal artery . The aim study evaluate effect Tibolone Flow-Mediated Dilatation brachial artery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Menopause transitional phase biological evolution woman loss reproductive capacity . The phenomenon strike manifestation represent vasomotor hot flush sweat , consequent fall estradiol production ovary . The main landmark menopause menopause , last period govern ovary , reflect depletion follicle . The main clinical manifestation climacteric vascular , act mechanism action fully understood . Several study publish show effect vasomotor tone demonstrate production vasoactive substance vascular cell induce . The main objective HRT ( Hormone Replacement Therapy ) , improve physical psychological state woman climacteric disorder , lead improve quality life . The American College Physicians , careful review available evidence , recommend postmenopausal woman consider eligible receive HRT decision treat individualize . Besides knowledge pattern endocrine patient climate , investigator must subject full physical examination ( pelvic ) exams plan start HRT . Complementary test must clinically orient , respect resource available . There need make routine use dose gonadotropin sex steroid , reserve certain diagnostic situation doubt , example , premature ovarian failure syndrome . He currently world consensus best available treatment menopause hormone replacement therapy exogenously reset hormone produce ovary . HRT fulfill several objective : reverse neurovegetative symptom , improve trophism genital atrophy genital-urinary , act prevention treatment osteoporosis , lead low incidence colorectal cancer , promote later onset , low incidence , evolution improvement symptom Alzheimer 's disease positive influence view . The development HRT result prove individual benefit epidemiological bring new question appropriate way use various scheme available . The treatment regimen design establish hormonal profile similar premenopausal use : estrogen , progestogen androgens different dos rout administration . Estrogens commonly use conjugate estrogen . The subcutaneous implant ( 17 beta estradiol ) The percutaneous estradiol form gel , transdermal device ( patch ) Tibolone . Hormones use alone combine , cyclic continuous , always try individualize situation order provide patient regimen suit need desire . Since description 1989 , extent dilatation brachial artery flow-mediated ( FMD ) use assess endothelial function . It believe ischemia induce inflation cuff cause dilation vessel , lead increase brachial artery flow . This effect seem mediate NO production normal endothelial cell . In patient whose bioactivity NO decrease absent endothelial function impairment , dilatory response happen . The dilation brachial artery thus high patient normal endothelial function patient pathology lead endothelial injury , among , Hypertension , Coronary heart disease , diabetes mellitus , smoking , hyperlipidemia Pre-Eclampsia . Patients randomly divide two group 30 , use code envelope medication , without responsible study know component use ( double-blind study ) , group divide follow : - Group 1 placebo 30 day ; - Group 2 : Tibolone 2.5 mg / day 30 day Patients evaluate use drug end use ( 28-30 day medication use ) .</detailed_description>
