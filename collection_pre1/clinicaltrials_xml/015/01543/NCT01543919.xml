	<criteria>Male female subject , include , age 40 80 year . Subjects diagnosis , least 6 month , moderate severe COPD ( GOLD ) meet criterion Stage IIIII disease : Subjects must postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 postbronchodilator FEV1 30 80 % ( inclusive ) predict value age , height , race sex use European Community Coal Steel ECCS standard NHANES III standard . Subjects must smoke history least 10 packyears* meet one follow criterion : They current smoker , exsmokers abstain smoke least 6 month . Subjects treat tiotropium bromide ( SPIRIVA HandiHaler ) 18 microgram daily least 1 month prior screen . Subjects must stable disease least 1 month prior screen . During screen runin phase subject must able manage disease symptom adequately tiotropium bromide +/ salbutamol ( albuterol ) rescue medication ( subject use &gt; 10 actuation [ 100 microgram/actuations ] daily 2 consecutive day ) , without reliance therapy include oral inhaled corticosteroid , longacting bronchodilator , nebulizer therapy , theophylline , roflumilast regular oxygen . A COPD exacerbation require treatment oral steroid hospitalization treatment COPD within 3 month screen . History low respiratory tract infection significant disease instability month precede screening time screen randomization . History presence respiratory failure , cor pulmonale right ventricular failure . Subjects home oxygen therapy ( either PRN longterm oxygen therapy ) . Any clearly documented history adult asthma chronic respiratory disorder ( eg , bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , pneumoconiosis ) . Known previous diagnosis Hepatitis B C HIV infection ( specific screening require ) . History cancer ( cutaneous basal cell ) previous 5 year . Active past history GI hemorrhage etiology , peptic ulceration , erosive esophagitis , gastric outlet obstruction inflammatory bowel disease . Regular use aspirin dose great 325 mg/day . History within previous 6 month : myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia ( eg , atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , supraventricular tachycardia , ventricular tachycardia ) , leave ventricular failure , unstable angina , coronary angioplasty , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) . A family history long QT syndrome . Presenting : Any condition possibly affect oral drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy clinically significant diabetic gastroenteropathy ) . Any clinically significant skin lesion describe Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Dermatology ( CTCAE ) Version 3.0 . Any clinically significant active systemic cutaneous infection include herpetic lesion . Congestive heart failure require treatment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IIIIV . ECG abnormalities screen randomization , include list : Subjects prerandomization evidence QTcF prolongation ( define &gt; 450 m ) screen baseline ( Week 0 ) eligible randomization . This assessment base confirm mean triplicate ECG recording make investigator time ECG collection . Predominant heart rhythm normal sinus rhythm eg , atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , supraventricular tachycardia . Atrioventricular ( AV ) block great first degree . Resting heart rate &gt; 100 &lt; 40 bpm . Evidence previous myocardial infarction absence clinical history consistent finding . Evidence acute ischemia .</criteria>
