	<brief_title>Application Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance Frail Elderly : The Effects Postural Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study base guideline fall management exercise program ( FaME ) design exercise Skelton Dinan . The FAME program structure four biocybernetic pillar embed three successive stage train . The biocybernetic pillar : 1. improve balance 2. improvement functional capacity 3. improvement bone density muscle mass Overthrowing 4 ) improve security ( reduce anxiety ) . The training phase reach follow goal : 1 . Skilling : aim improve improve neuromuscular control , postural control strengthen large muscle group low extremity . 2 . Training Gain : aim improve functional ability . 3 . Maintaining Gains : goal muscle mass bone density introduce build complex multi-sensory exercise . We start FaME program assistance pilot study , `` Effects stochastic resonance therapy postural control elderly population '' ( KEK Bern : No.228/09 , Trial Registry : NCT01045746 ) . It find whole-body vibration stochastic resonance ( SR-WBV ) enable strength , coordination , balance training standing , exercise train gain phase possible . For reason , study examine feasibility immediately long term effect SR-WBV 6 Hz , Noise 4 postural control strength frail elderly .</detailed_description>
