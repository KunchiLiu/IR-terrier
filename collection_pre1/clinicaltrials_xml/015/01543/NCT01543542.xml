	<brief_summary>Helical tomotherapy novel radiation treatment machine combine two exist technology : spiral radiotherapy treatment combine simultaneous compute tomotherapy image body . This new machine potentially allow radiation treatment focus precisely , deliver accurately exist radiation machine . In study , helical tomotherapy use provide radiation treatment ( whole brain radiotherapy , daily 10 treatment ) commonly use treat cancer metastatic brain . In addition , individual spot cancer ( metastasis ) brain treat high dose ( approximately 2 time higher ) dose whole brain . The purpose study determine effectiveness whole brain radiation lesion boost helical tomotherapy machine .</brief_summary>
