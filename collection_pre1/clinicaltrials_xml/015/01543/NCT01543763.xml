	<brief_title>Phase I Tolerability , Efficacy , Safety Study Pazopanib Combination With PCI-24781 Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale/purpose Pazopanib potent , multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor44 VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , PDGFR-α -β c-kit approve metastatic renal cell carcinoma base phase III data show significant prolongation PFS ( 5 mo pretreated patient 8.3 mos treatment-naïve patient ) . In addition recent data present year , yet publish , treatment-refractory sarcoma patient show PFS significantly prolong median 20 vs. 7 week . As occur antiangiogenic agent , resistance pazopanib may develop . Epigenetic modification HDAC inhibitor may overcome drug resistance cause increase accessibility DNA chemotherapeutic agent may therefore significantly potentiate cytotoxicity . Combination trial chemotherapy agent ongoing ( clinicaltrials.gov . ) To knowledge , combination trial HDACi anti-angiogenesis agent yet perform represent unmet medical need . PCI-24781 pan HDAC inhibitor . In cell line test , up-regulation down-regulation gene know result change signal transduction , oxidation , metabolic change , apoptosis , proliferation , differentiation angiogenesis see . In addition , ongoing single agent combination trial show drug effective well-tolerated . Hypothesis : Combining antiangiogenic agent , pazopanib , epigenetic modifier , histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) PCI-24781 , increase efficacy pazopanib well overcome development resistance pazopanib .</detailed_description>
