	<brief_summary>Episodic ataxia type 2 ( EA2 ) rare familial neurological condition characterize debilitate episode vertigo imbalance . Since serendipitous discovery dramatic response EA2 acetazolamide , acetazolamide first-line treatment EA2 . Yet , patient respond tolerate acetazolamide , alternative treatment . The purpose randomized trial test whether 4-aminopyridine may reduce ataxia episode EA2 alternative acetazolamide . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim determine whether 4-aminopyridine ( 4AP ) reduce attack ataxia patient episodic ataxia type 2 ( EA2 ) , rare often debilitate condition . Episodic ataxia ( EA ) group inherit disorder characterize recurrent , discrete episode vertigo ataxia variably associate progressive ataxia . EA2 , common best characterized EA syndrome , cause heterozygous mutation CACNA1A , encode main subunit neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel , Cav2.1 . Although observational data suggest symptomatic resolution acetazolamide many EA2 patient , investigator find patient database least third EA2 patient continue suffer debilitate ataxia attack , either incomplete control acetazolamide intolerability hypersensitivity acetazolamide . For patient alternative intervention . 4-Aminopyridine ( 4AP ) find helpful handful patient EA2 . Recently , dalfampridine , extend release formulation 4AP ( AMPYRA ) Acorda Therapeutics , receive FDA approval improve gait multiple sclerosis . The investigator plan recruit 20 subject genetically define EA2 suffer frequent ataxia episode ( least 3 episode month ) conduct randomize trial 4AP examine efficacy tolerability EA2 . Study subject recruit UCLA University Rochester participate randomize , double-blind , double-crossover trial 4AP.Each treatment period 2-months 1-week wash-out period treatment period . Participating subject undergo standardized history physical examination time enrollment . Participants log ataxia attack daily interactive voice response ( IVR ) system interview monthly event side effects/toxicity . Study visit occur begin end study .</detailed_description>
