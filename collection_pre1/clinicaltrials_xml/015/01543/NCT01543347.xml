	<brief_title>Temocillin Use Complicated Urinary Tract Infections Due Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases ( ESBL ) /AmpC Enterobacteriaceae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spectrum activity together route excretion temocillin make good candidate treatment urinary tract infection . Several study show good clinical microbiological activity uncomplicated complicate cystitis pyelonephritis adult pyelonephritis child old 2 month . However specific study perform Urinary Tract Infections due broad spectrum ÃŸ-lactamases produce strain . In context , study aim demonstrate efficacy temocillin treatment complicate Urinary Tract Infection due confirm Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases ( ESBL ) produce AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae United Kingdom . The investigator also evaluate tolerance drug monitoring adverse event incidence eventual Clostridium difficile associate infection .</detailed_description>
