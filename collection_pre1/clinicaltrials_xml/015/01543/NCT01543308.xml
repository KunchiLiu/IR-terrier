	<brief_summary>The protein composition HDL complicate . The investigator identify 40 distinct protein associate HDL proteomics technology , protein confirm related function anti-inflammation , anti-oxidation , improvement endothelial function , inhibition thrombosis . And investigator also find level protein HDL change patient coronary heart disease , compare healthy control group . So , study conduct two follow aspect : enlarge sample size verify preliminary result find new research idea pathogenesis biomarkers coronary heart disease ; study change HDL protein composition patient coronary heart disease statins treatment use proteomics technology order find mechanism statin pleiotropic effect indicator evaluate treatment effectiveness .</brief_summary>
