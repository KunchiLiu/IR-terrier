	<brief_summary>The RIAL study aim investigate whether non-invasive measurement liver fat , iron content fibrosis accurate liver biopsy specimen determine patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , suspect liver disease . Currently , gold-standard diagnosis stag liver disease liver biopsy . In study , consecutive patient offer multiparametric MR scan ass liver await liver biopsy . Study time-frame : The scan perform 6-week period biopsy , result compare biopsy finding . result present end study MR data outcome compare gold-standard biopsy dat . Participants attend one study visit participate - patient follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity per se cause liver dysfunction failure well study . However , although common disease , present reliable way diagnose percutaneous liver biopsy . This painful without risk , liver highly vascular organ . Even ultrasound guidance , still diagnostic test underused carry 1:1000 risk serious adverse event ( eg bleeding , infection , bowel perforation ) invasive . Moreover , patient require test often impair clot blood due liver dysfunction , high risk bleeding , need observe hospital hour procedure . This add cost procedure . As result factor , liver biopsy use patient NAFLD , NASH liver disease suspect , unless patient clinically moderate severe disease . With increase prevalence obesity community , NASH NAFLD become increasingly common , need reliable , feasible cost-effective non-invasive diagnostic tool condition . Moreover , often coexist liver disease ( eg tumour , autoimmune liver disease ) . There approximately 1.5million UK adult mild moderate liver disease , present , ascertain non-invasively . Developments magnetic resonance medicine may allow u accurately diagnose liver fibrosis , use amount extracellular fluid ( ECF ) biomarker fibrosis . T1 map liver reliably show difference ECF content thereby allow quantification degree liver fibrosis . In conjunction MR spectroscopy T2* mapping concurrent interpretation lipid iron content , allow rapid non-invasive diagnosis type and/or severity many common liver disease ( NAFLD/NASH , hepatitis , iron overload ) .</detailed_description>
