	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common cutaneous malignancy . In United States alone , incidence tumor approach exceed one million case year , continue increase . Actinic damage primary causal factor , 85 % lesion locate cosmetically-sensitive area face , head , neck . Although tumor usually metastasize , high prevalence morbidity establish significant public health problem . In addition small percentage cause significant morbidity mortality . Treatment goal BCC focus complete tumor removal minimization cosmetic functional defect . Among multiple therapeutic option available , include excisional ablative approach , MMS definitive treatment modality . MMS involve excision clinically apparent neoplastic lesion , process stain horizontal frozen section , stepwise microscopic analysis , meticulous mapping , re-excision residual neoplasm tumor-free margin obtain . Unlike excisional technique , MMS allow visualization entire surgical margin , thus ensure complete removal lesion maximally preserve surround normal skin . Unfortunately , many tumor show significant sub clinical extension , result surgical defect completion MMS significantly large present lesion , often necessitate complex , costly , time-consuming repair , compromise final cosmetic appearance function . In addition , tumor low-risk location , typically undergo simple excision , nonetheless require significant circumferential margin normal tissue ensure complete removal , impact cosmesis , function cost . Likewise , aggressive tumor sclerosing/morpheaform recurrent BCC 's result significant post surgical defect associate morbidity decrease function . Presently , treatment BCC , whether excisional ablative mean , incurs estimate annual cost excess $ 600 million . An effective oral agent treatment BCC could serve adjunct modality removal primary recurrent lesion may expect significantly decrease cosmetic disfigurement well reduce treatment-associated cost . In fact , study one may ultimately show oral treatment result complete elimination select neoplastic lesion , thereby eliminate altogether need surgery lesion . Vismodegib , ( GDC-0449 ) orally deliver small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor . In tumor growth Hedgehog binding PCTH1 ( Patched ) stop PCTH1 inhibit SMO ( smoothen ) signal . In absence PCTH1 ( e.g . loss PCTH1 mutation ) SMO signal occurs constitutively , stimulate GLI1 ( Glioma-Associated Oncogene-1 ) thus promote tumor growth . Vismodegib inhibit SMO signal direct interaction SMO thus prevent activation GLI1 thus inhibit tumor growth Basal Cell Carcinomas . The investigator anticipate study demonstrate feasibility , efficacy , safety Vismodegib oral treatment BCC . The safety , preliminary efficacy , pharmacokinetics Vismodegib assess open-label , multicenter , two-stage Phase I trial1 . Patients solid tumor refractory therapy . An expansion cohort include patient locally advance metastatic BCC ( n=33 ) . Patients receive continuous administration Vismodegib 150 mg/day ( n=17 ) , 270 mg/day ( n=15 ) , 540 mg/day ( n=1 ) begin Day 1 . Patients treated disease progression , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal study . Response assessments radiologically measurable disease , RECIST version 1.0 use . CR PR determine 2 consecutive occasion â‰¥4 week apart . Locally advance tumor assess Dermatological Examination . CR define disappearance palpable visible tumor ; PR define reduction &gt; 50 % tumor diameter . Results pilot study demonstrate oral vismodegib could clear reduce tumor burden BCCs CR 2 , PR 16 , SD 11 PD 4 patient follow 20 month period . No dose-limiting toxic event grade 5 event observe single grade 4 adverse event ( asymptomatic hyponatremia ) report . The significant frequent adverse event GI relate dysgeusia muscle spasm report . Recently , one Phase II single-arm , non-randomized trial single-agent vismodegib 150 mg/day progression intolerance 104 patient enrol : ( 33 mBCC , 71 LA BCC ) use primary endpoint : Independent Review Facility ( IRF ) assess overall response rate ( ORR ) secondary endpoint : Investigator-assessed ORR , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , duration response , safety also recently complete announce study meet primary endpoint ( ORR ) show shrinkage tumor pre-defined percentage patients2 . A preliminary safety assessment show common adverse event consistent previous experience vismodegib . The common adverse event muscle spasm , hair loss , alter taste sensation , weight loss , fatigue , nausea , decrease appetite diarrhea . A detailed safety assessment ongoing . Since slow-growing tumor expect respond favorably treatment , since lesion surgically excise MMS within 6 month initial consultation , study affect current standard care management BCC . After target tumor site identify guide either plastic template tattoo perform pre treatment original lesion delineate use template concentric circle two millimeter draw around central target area . A punch biopsy center lesion perform thereafter lesion excise use standard Mohs procedure , excise tissue evaluate histologically confirm presence absence tumor . If residual tumor find histologically scar significant inflammation present histologically additional layer perform use 2mm concentric circle guide tumor deem remove . The final wound size completion Mohs surgery ( i.e. , upon reach tumor-free tissue margin ) determine use pre-treatment concentric margin , compare lesion size initiation treatment treatment placebo area . In addition , histological extent lesion compare expect sub clinical extension document Wolf Zitelli previously note . Any subject discontinue treatment prematurely encourage return clinic excision . Only subject histological evidence BCC consider complete responder . Note post excision antibiotic analgesic administer subject prophylactically infection pain excision site must record concomitant medication page CRF .</detailed_description>
