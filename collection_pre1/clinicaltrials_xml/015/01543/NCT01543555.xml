	<brief_summary>Patients submit noncardiac surgery increase risk serious cardiovascular complication . Statins show low cholesterol level reduce cardiovascular event scenario . The objective study explore effect atorvastatin , compare placebo , 30-day risk composite death , nonfatal Myocardial Injury Noncardiac Surgery ( MINS ) , stroke among patient undergo noncardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lowering Risk Operative Complications Using Atorvastatin Loading Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular complication , myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke common perioperative period noncardiac surgery . To moment safe effective intervention reduce vascular event scenario . Data observational study small-sized randomize control trial ( RCTs ) show promising result term risk reduction . In addition , experimental data indicate statin acute anti-inflammatory property , promote stabilization atherosclerotic lesion , therefore , might reduce risk MI , even short term . This study design explore effect atorvastatin , compare placebo , 30-day risk composite death , nonfatal Myocardial Injury Noncardiac Surgery ( MINS ) , stroke among patient undergo noncardiac surgery . The study conduct accordance prespecified protocol reach successful enrollment rate , end 2014 steer committee invite join international initiative participate much large clinical trial investigate relevant question . Due outstanding possibility , steer committee decide redesign study format exploratory trial . As described , study complete inclusion 648 participant June , 2015 .</detailed_description>
