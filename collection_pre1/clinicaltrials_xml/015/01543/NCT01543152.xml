	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Cyclophosphamide HIV-Infected Subjects HAART Receiving SB-728-T</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study augment HIV-specific T-cells reverse decrease progressive destruction CD4+ T-cells lead clinical AIDS . Levels engraftment vary negligible 10 % CD4+ T-cells vascular compartment . Preliminary analysis HAART TI suggest anti-HIV effect may correlate level SB-728-T engraftment . Concurrently , non-myeloablative lymphodepletion cyclophosphamide demonstrate enhance engraftment adoptively transfer T-cells variety mechanism . The study undertaken increase SB-728-T engraftment administration low non-myeloablative dos cyclophosphamide .</detailed_description>
