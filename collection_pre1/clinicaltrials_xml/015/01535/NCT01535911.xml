	<brief_summary>This study look effect , good and/or bad , treat primary brain cancer diet therapy use energy restrict ketogenic diet ( ERKD ) use food . An energy restrict ketogenic diet diet design keep blood sugar low range normal time increase blood concentration metabolic break product call ketone . This diet currently use treat child uncontrollable seizure . This diet well tolerated child minimal side effect report use diet year . - The main purpose study find whether energy restrict ketogenic diet help patient primary brain cancer either decrease size cancer keep cancer grow . - Another reason study learn side effect associate energy restrict ketogenic diet patient primary brain cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary : The current standard care glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , common primary brain tumor adult , include surgical resection , radiation chemotherapy . Survival rarely exceed 18 month . The investigator propose test hypothesis brain tumor cell unable utilize ketone source energy deprive glucose , due mitochondrial dysfunction , whereas normal glia neuron survive metabolic stress . A nutritionally adequate energy restrict , ketogenic diet ( ERKD ) deprive brain tumor energy result death glioma cell promise . ERKD-based therapy manage brain cancer biologically plausible support data animal model . A multidisciplinary team oncologist , register dietitian , physiologist implement ERKD therapy newly diagnose GBM subject . After initial maximal tumor excision , ERKD therapy initiate subject one week inpatient admission Sparrow Hospital local outpatient supervise registered dietitian experience implement therapy.The ERKD continue adjunctive therapy along radiation therapy standard care chemotherapy . The supervised ERKD continue additional 6 week completion radiation therapy along standard care chemotherapy . The objective trial determine whether ERKD decrease tumor size result recurrence individual GBM measure serial MRI imaging . Enzymes signal pathway regulate metabolism cell growth assess initial post-ERKD tumor use standard biochemical approach .</detailed_description>
