	<brief_title>Furlow Palatoplasty With Tensor Tenopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost infant young child bear cleft palate ( without cleft lip ) middle-ear disease condition last late childhood early adolescence . The type middle-ear disease usually occur cleft palate patient associate pain symptom , fluid middle-ear cause poor hear sometimes problem balance . Past study show middle-ear disease infant child cleave palate cause inability open natural tube connects back nose middle-ear ( call Eustachian tube ) . Opening Eustachian tube require keep pressure middle-ear equal atmosphere prevents fluid build middle-ear . For reason , middle-ear disease usually treat place small plastic tube eardrum keep middle-ear pressure pressure room ( atmospheric pressure ) equal even Eustachian tube fail open . However , disease often return plastic tube become block fall new tube need place eardrum . The action two small muscle , levator veli palatini ( LVP ) muscle tensor veli palatini ( TVP ) muscle combine open Eustachian tube LVP muscle play role raise palate speech , swallow activity . Both muscle run soft palate . In child cleft palate , usual position , orientation function muscle abnormal surgical procedure palate repair focus re-establishing `` normal '' orientation attachment muscle . One well accepted method repair palate , Furlow palatoplasty standard procedure use two cleft palate surgeon involve study . During Furlow palatoplasty attachment TVP muscle cut . Recently , modification Furlow palatoplasty , call tensor tenopexy , describe involves attach cut part TVP muscle bony hook soft palate effort improve Eustachian tube function lead less middle-ear disease . One small study present result suggest middle-ear disease cure earlier age cleft palate patient palates repaired use modify Furlow procedure compare number method palate repair , comparison include standard Furlow procedure . However , design study poor possible benefit small modification surgical procedure respect middle-ear disease need evaluate formal study . Because surgical procedure Furlow palatoplasty modify Furlow procedure identical exception addition anchor cut muscle attachment , study two procedure allow u determine modify procedure improve middle-ear disease earlier age patient cleft palate .</detailed_description>
