	<brief_summary>After implantation Ahmed glaucoma valve patient glaucoma , hyperencapsulation phase unwanted postoperative phenomenon , typically occur free 3 month postoperatively . When occur , treat aqueous suppressant eye drop . This study aim determine possible reduce rate hyperencapsulation phase . Patients treatment group receive aqueous suppressant eye drop hyperencapsulation phase start . Treatment initiate intraocular pressure pre-defined level , target pre-defined range .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Prophylactic Aqueous Suppression Hyperencapsulation Ahmed Glaucoma Valves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients glaucoma require tube shunt surgery , without simultaneous cataract surgery , enrol prospective randomize control study ten sit across Canada United States ( determine ) . Patients highly advanced glaucoma high risk fixation loss , neovascular glaucoma , chronic uveitis , mark corneal disease , sulfa allergy , renal disease contraindication diamox use exclude . Patients schedule Ahmed glaucoma valve surgery , without cataract surgery , randomize use stratified central block randomization approach treatment group control group . Those scheduled combine cataract tube shunt randomize separately receive tube shunt alone . Surgeons mask postoperative treatment control group time surgery since randomization occur patient one-week postoperative Those treatment group would receive short-term prophylactic aqueous suppression first 3 postoperative month maintain intraocular pressure ( IOP ) 7 10mmHg . The control group would receive prophylactic aqueous suppression , would treat use similar protocol treatment group event Hyperencapsulation phase ( HEP ) endpoint meet . Prophylactic aqueous suppression study group would give 1st 3 month postoperatively . At 3 month visit , aqueous suppression stop . The primary outcome measure washout IOP 4 month postoperative . Washout IOP check one month discontinuation ( earlier need i.e. , advance glaucoma patient ) . Beyond 3 month , aqueous suppressant would use clinician 's discretion base IOP . At conclusion study , 4-month postoperative washout IOP , incidence HEP , 12-month IOP , 13-month washout IOP , medication requirement would compare treatment control arm .</detailed_description>
