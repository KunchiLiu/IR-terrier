	<brief_summary>Orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) treatment choice patient Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection end-stage liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma ; infection graft hepatitis C recurrence universal OLT recurrent HCV hepatitis often follow accelerated course OLT , rapid histological recurrence cirrhosis . These poor outcome significantly affect graft patient survival reduces benefit transplantation indication . Therapeutic strategy available ; high viral load , high prevalence genotype 1b need dose reduction interferon ribavirin side effect intolerance , together interference immunosuppressive drug , result vast majority patient failure obtain viral eradication . Recently , Silibinin , study report capable act potent antiviral agent patient HCV ; use successfully protocol 14 day intravenous infusion previous non-responders peginterferon/ribavirin therapy . In view postulate profile safety , seem ideal drug use set HCV recurrent patient liver transplant . Aim prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study determine therapeutic effect Legalon SIL prevention HCV reinfection chronically infect hepatitis C patient OLT . Awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation patient affect HCV randomise 3:1 receive , addition current therapy , silibinin 20mg/kg/day ( Legalon SIL ) placebo infuse 2 hour 14 21 consecutive day ; addition , patient receive treatment silibinin 20mg/kg/day ( Legalon SIL ) , infuse 2 hour , 7 day transplant . The Primary Efficacy endpoint achieve sustain virological response ( SVR ) Secondary Efficacy endpoint evaluate virologic response , percentage patient decrease least 2 log10 level HCV-RNA safety Legalon SIL population .</brief_summary>
