	<brief_summary>Goal-directed hemodynamic fluid optimization show key factor medical care anesthesia.According medical literature , goal-directed fluid hemodynamic optimization efficient base dynamic parameter base static one , major dynamic criterion cardiac output . Unfortunately , transpulmonary thermodilution , device consider `` The gold standard '' evaluate cardiac output associate many complications.Furthermore , device commercialize past decade able replace transpulmonary thermodilution . As monitoring device n't reliable enough widely use practice leave aside benefit clinical evaluation . Even though , hemodynamic optimization base analysis several clinical parameter seem guarantee good care thanks favorable benefits/risks balance , could improve new plug play mini-invasive system . In investigator opinion , ECOM system seem able provide monitor tool responds expectation modern hemodynamic monitoring device . It use well know technique , bioimpedance . The investigator suppose device efficient one use . Indeed , system build endotracheal tube , come closer aorta , measure make , record signal less affected passage surround tissue . This randomize control trial study Patients schedule elective coronary surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . The purpose trial evaluate benefit intraoperative goal-directed hemodynamic therapy base ECOM cardiac output measure mortality major postoperative cardiac morbidity coronary surgery , compare standard management strategy . Patients allocate control ECOM group , 50 people . The standard management strategy , apply control group , set lead attend anesthetist , base analysis clinical parameter . The ECOM Group face hemodynamic optimization strategy lead ECOM evaluation cardiac output stroke volume variation . The main hypothesis hemodynamic strategy lead ECOM cardiac output measure reduce mortality morbidity cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
