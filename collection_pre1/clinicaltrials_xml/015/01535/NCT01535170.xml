	<detailed_description>Background Nosocomial infection Nosocomial infection , especially cause bacteria resistant antibiotic , major threat critical care medicine . A systemic review reveal 10-20 % patient receive mechanical ventilation ( MV ) 48 hour develop ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) , patient develop VAP twice likely die compare similar patient without VAP , patient develop VAP additional hospital cost $ 10,019 [ 1 ] . The problem occur Respiratory Care Centers ( RCCs ) design care patient prolong mechanical ventilation ( PMV ) , MV 21 day , Taiwan . One report Taiwan show nosocomial infection rate RCC 40 % patient develop nosocomial infection lower wean rate high mortality compare patient without infection [ 2 ] . It estimate 50 % 60 % nosocomial infection occur year United Sates cause antibiotic-resistant bacterial strain [ 3 ] . This high rate resistant strain increase morbidity , mortality medical cost infection . Preventing infection limit emergence antibiotic-resistant strain two important issue critical care medicine . Selective Decontamination Digestive Tract ( SDD ) One current hypotheses nosocomial infection colonization nasopharynx oropharynx predisposes patient development nosocomial pneumonia , bacterial overgrowth intestinal tract increase gut wall permeability , lead bacterial translocation sepsis . Selective decontamination digestive tract ( SDD ) , aim eradicate colonization potential pathogen oropharynx gastrointestinal tract , one strategy reduce ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) sepsis critically ill patient . Controversy exist effectiveness SDD reduce mortality prevent antibiotic resistance [ 4-6 ] . The present SDD regimen may create selective pressure induce emergence methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , Gram-negative bacillus harbor extended-spectrum β-lactamases ( ESBL ) , even Candida [ 7 , 8 ] . Therefore , SDD research must aim find ideal regimen effective pathogen leave anaerobic flora undisturbed . Lactoferrin Lactoferrin ( LF ) iron-binding glycoprotein find milk various external secretion saliva , tear , airway secretion , granule neutrophil , imply important role innate immunity . This protein number biological function , include antimicrobial , anti-tumor , antioxidant , immunomodulatory effect . Partial degradation LF pepsin stomach , may give rise peptide term lactoferricin potent antimicrobial activity . LF lactoferricin show inhibit growth number pathogenic bacteria include antibiotic-resistant strain , fungi even virus vitro vivo study [ 9,10 ] . In mouse experiment , oral administration bovine LF reduce bacterial infection gastrointestinal tract [ 9 ] promote growth bacteria low iron requirement Lactobacillus Bifidobacteria , generally believe beneficial host [ 11 ] . Bovine lactoferrin ( bLF ) human lactoferrin ( hLF ) high ( 77 % ) amino acid homology , bLF exhibit even high vitro antimicrobial activity hLF.5 Bovine lactoferrin grant GRAS ( generally recognize safe ) status US Food Drug Administration [ 12 ] basis add infant formula many manufacturer report adverse effect . Despite many promise vitro animal experimental data , clinical information bLF scarce , study investigate effect bLF supplementation patient prolong mechanical ventilation . Our previous study We previously demonstrate recombinant porcine LF ( pLF ) produce yeast [ 13 ] synthetic 20-residue porcine lactoferricin peptide [ 11 ] exhibit antimicrobial activity vitro . Its bactericidal activity four time effective human lactoferricin [ 14 ] . In recent report [ 15 ] , perform pathogen challenge digestive tract transgenic milk-fed animal model test porcine LF ( pLF ) effective SDD regimen . Transgenic mouse express recombinant LF milk 120 ± 13.6 mg/L lactation stage feed normal CD-1 mouse pup 4 week . The pup subsequently challenge pathogenic Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus Candida albicans . The group feed pLF transgenic milk demonstrate statistically significant improvement weight gain , low bacterial number intestinal fluid , blood liver , healthy microvilli small intestinal tissue , low proinflammatory cytokine compare control group feed normal milk . Results show recombinant pLF express milk transgenic mouse feed mice pup lead broad spectrum antimicrobial activity digestive tract protect mucosa small intestine injury , imply porcine LF use effective selective decontaminant digestive tract . Aim study This study prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial examine whether oral supplementation bLF reduce nosocomial infection , sepsis even mortality patient prolong mechanical ventilation . Methods Patients Between July 1 , 2010 , June 30 , 2012 , enroll 280 patient mechanical ventilation 21 day evident sign infection admission Respiratory Care Centers ( RCCs ) clinical study . The study send Ethics Committees China Medical University Hospital approval . Patients guardian provide write informed consent explanation . Exclusion criterion inform consent lacking/refused , ongoing antibiotic treatment infection , predict mortality 7 day . All patient follow death discharge hospital . Objectives The primary objective evaluate effectiveness bLF prevention first episode nosocomial infection sepsis bacterial fungal origin admission RCC . Secondary objective assessment incidence pneumonia , urinary tract infection sepsis , mortality prior discharge ( overall sepsis-attributable ) , wean rate MV , total day MV , alteration immune system , cytokine liver function , adverse effect intolerance . Study design Lactoferrin placebo mask drug A B factory . Randomization stratify center patient randomize A B group random-number table sequence inform consent obtain . No patient , research nurse , investigator , medical staff RCC aware assignment study period . Patients receive either bLF ( 10 mg/Kg/day ) ( Westland Co-operative Dairy Company , New Zealand ) placebo ( starch ) control . The dosage bLF base mean hLF intake low body weight neonates ingest mother 's fresh milk first 2 week life ( 30-150 mg/d ) [ 16 ] bLF 200 mg bid find effective suppress Helicobacter pylorus [ 17 ] . Drug administration begin within 24 hour RCC admission last 6 week discharge . Medication nutritional support prescribe medical routine . Systematic surveillance adverse event ( eg , vomit , feed intolerance , skin rash ) perform daily examination . Weekly surveillance liver function , complete blood count , CD4/CD8 , cytokine ( TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-12 , IL-18 ) perform [ 18,19 ] . Definition outcomes The diagnosis sepsis base detection clinical sign symptom physician charge , presence laboratory finding consistent sepsis , isolation causative organism blood body fluid . Patients episode sepsis continue receive follow-up death discharge RCC secondary outcome [ 16 ] . VAP characterize presence sign respiratory infection ( fever , leukocytosis purulent respiratory secretion ) , new persistent infiltrate chest X-ray patient undergo MV [ 20 ] . Urinary tract infection diagnose isolation pathogen urine collect suprapubic puncture bladder catheterization , growth 100 000 bacteria/mL 10 000 fungi/mL . Success wean MV define need MV 5 day . Statistical Analysis Sample size analysis predict total 131 MV patient group would need detect relative difference treat non-treated patient least 60 % ( decrease 20 % 6 % ) mortality rate base two-sided test type I error 0.05 less 80 % power 80 % . Quantitative variable express mean standard deviation . Categorical variable represent percentage . Univariate analyse explore association individual risk factor primary/secondary outcome perform use Fisher 's exact test dichotomous variable Student 's test continuous variable . A multivariate logistic regression model perform investigate effect relevant risk factor relative contribution various risk factor . Goodness fit evaluate log-likelihood fit model . Odds ratios 95 % confidence interval calculate logistic regression model describe strength relationship categorical risk factor outcomes . All test two-sided , p-value 0.05 consider statistically significant . All analysis carry use SAS software version 6.12 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) . EXPECTED FINDINGS Our finding expect answer follow question follow : 1 . Can oral supplement bLF prevent nosocomial infection patient PMV ? 2 . Can oral supplement bLF reduce incidence nosocomial infection reduce use antibiotic patient PMV ? 3 . Can oral supplement bLF reduce mortality patient PMV ? 4 . Can oral supplement bLF increase wean rate MV patient PMV ? 5 . What change immune system oral supplement bLF patient PMV ? EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION FROM CURRENT PROJECT Preventing infection limit emergence antibiotic-resistant strain two important issue critical care medicine . To find natural antimicrobial peptide adjuvant therapy antimicrobial agent treatment antibiotic-resistant strain , regimen increase immunity prevent infection one direction research . LF one promise agent many vitro animal study . The study try examine LF ideal natural SDD regimen prevention nosocomial pneumonia sepsis patient PMV . If result positive , LF use clinically increase survival critically ill patient , increase wean rate MV , reduce prescription antibiotic finally medical cost .
