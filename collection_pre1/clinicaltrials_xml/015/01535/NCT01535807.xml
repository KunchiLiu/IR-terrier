	<brief_title>CorMatrix ECM Study : To Identify Inflammatory Markers Following CABG With/Without ECM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pericardium 's main function secrete proteins ensure proper function within pericardial space maintain pericardial pressure . Once dissected pericardium usually leave open end surgery due difficulty realign edge avoid adverse effect cause inflammatory response . The body 's inflammatory response one protection heal injury . However many inflammatory biomarkers release cause adverse outcome cardiac surgery , include : renal failure , myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation , stroke death . CorMatrix extra cellular matrix ( ECM ) Technology Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve unique extra cellular implant material use pericardial closure reconstruction . Pericardial reconstruction use porcine intestinal ECM novel application . ECM combine innate attribute nature precision science help heart heal . It acellular biomaterial encapsulate surgically implant , gradually remodel , leave behind organize healthy tissue . The body 's tissue begin remodel surgical site ECM maintain need tissue support . When implanted , ECM act scaffold patient 's cell migrate integrate , stimulate patient 's natural wound-healing mechanism . As patient 's cell become active , lay collagen , mature time form strong permanent tissue repair without leave behind permanent foreign material . Because ECM contain primarily collagen , device gradually replace patient 's tissue gradually turn natural state self-renewal . A retrospective study compare incidence post operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) patient treat CorMatrix ECM pericardial closure follow isolated coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) versus patient treat patch . The retrospective study comprise 222 patient . 111 treat CorMatrix ECM 111 . Results show POAF 34 111 control patient 20 111 CorMatrix ECM treat patient , indicate 54 % decrease risk POAF CorMatrix ECM treat patient . This study show statistically significant reduction risk POAF patient undergo isolated CABG pericardial closure use CorMatrix ECM . This unblinded , randomize study identify proteomic inflammatory biomarkers determine difference biomarkers patient treat use CorMatrix ECM implant close pericardium patient whose pericardium leave open ( current standard care ) . The study locate Inova Heart Vascular Institute ( IHVI ) . The CorMatrix ECM implant CABG surgical procedure IHVI cardiovascular operating room ( CVOR ) . Sixty ( 60 ) patient routinely schedule CABG recruit randomly assign one two group . There thirty ( 30 ) patient group . The control `` No Intervention '' group receive CorMatrix ECM surgery , leave pericardium open accord current standard care . The treatment `` Cormatrix '' group receive CorMatrix EMC surgery closure pericardium accord specific recommended surgical technique . Pericardial fluid blood sample collect patient . Pericardial fluid blood sample undergo novel nanoparticle base biomarker discovery technology harvest proteomic biomarkers George mason University . In addition , patient cardiac rhythm continually assess hospital stay follow appointment surgeon cardiologist determine whether developed POAF post discharge . Both gender , great eighteen ( 18 ) year age , include research . There enrollment restriction base upon race ethnic origin expect inclusion representative population undergo CABG IHVI . Pregnant woman exclude study .</detailed_description>
