	<brief_summary>Purpose study : AIM 1 Prospectively collect pre-operative ( fMRI , DTI , MEG ) intra-operative mapping data patient intra-axial brain tumor assess well modality predict location eloquent brain function . In addition , modality compare . AIM 2 Assess reorganization eloquent brain function plasticity patient intra-axial brain tumor . This accomplish prospectively collect post-operative mapping study neuropsychological test compare prior mapping study state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Eloquent Function Brain Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Any patient primary metastatic brain tumor near eloquent area would eligible participation study assume contraindication study operative procedure . Pre-operative : Evaluation include clinical evaluation , neuropsychological testing , MRI brain without contrast , fMRI , DTI tractograms , MEG study well standard pre-operative work-up . Intra-operative : All non-invasive pre-operative mapping data incorporate operative procedure imaging tool routinely use neurosurgical procedure . Patients awake map perform . Our usual standard care follow craniotomy , mapping , tumor resection biopsy . Post-operative : Patients routine post-operative care assessment consist clinical examination image obtain within 24 hour post resection . They routine follow-up outpatient appointment surgery include neurologic assessment follow-up imaging ( MRI without contrast ) tumor appropriate . The experimental portion protocol incorporate repeat neuropsychological test mapping study ( fMRI , DTI , MEG ) study 2 6 month post-surgery routine follow-up .</detailed_description>
