	<brief_summary>In minimally sedated Asian patient community set investigator show limited volume water infusion instead air insufflation either rectal sigmoid colon whole colon significantly reduce pain score colonoscopy . Cecal intubation rate compromise . The reduction pain score range 25 % 32 % previous studies.1 , 2 In contrast , several US report describe successful use large volume water infuse throughout entire colon patient undergo colonoscopy result great reduction pain score , average 56 % .3-5 A recent review suggest cause difference might lie time water removal.6 Specifically , investigator group remove infused water predominantly withdrawal phase ( water immersion ) U.S. group remove water insertion phase ( water exchange ) . This prospective , randomize control trial compare water exchange water immersion traditional air insufflation patient undergo minimally sedate colonoscopy . The investigator test hypothesis water exchange reduce pain water immersion investigator clinical setting .</brief_summary>
