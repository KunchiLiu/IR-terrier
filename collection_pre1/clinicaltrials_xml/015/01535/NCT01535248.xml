	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) commonly use diagnosis treatment biliary pancreatic disease . There case report present literature demonstrate adverse often fatal event follow air embolization associate performance ERCP . The frequency air embolus extremely rare exact incidence unknown . In recent year utilization echocardiography evaluate individual hemodynamic instability lead discovery intracardiac air embolus see individual demonstrate change either hemodynamic parameter capnography value . There exist propose mechanism translocation air foregut systemic venous circulation one mechanism yet validate . Some propose mechanism include either intrahepatic mechanism air cross biliary tract hepatic venule potentially foregut portal vein shunt vessel systemic venous circulation . The exact frequency air embolus likely high incidence fatal near-fatal complication report literature . Individuals best outcomes usually intubate capnography demonstrate change suggestive air embolus prior significant hemodynamic changes.1 As phenomenon previously well describe , possible patient suffer significant air embolus myocardial cerebral ischemic sequela recognize echocardiography use early tool evaluation hemodynamically unstable patient . It also possible number patient may suffer venous air embolus ERCP sub-clinical therefore cause enough change cardiac function alter either hemodynamic parameter capnography value . The literature suggest patient awake follow ERCP , image modality , echocardiography employ evaluation.1 Understanding frequency problem subgroup risk aid diagnosis treatment complication . Transthoracic echocardiography highly sensitive image modality adequate imaging window obtain demonstrate presence intracardiac air . The risk perform study patient zero low . The potential risk inaccurate interpretation avoid use trained individual acquisition interpretation transthoracic echocardiographic image . The purpose study 1 ) identify individual schedule undergo elective ERCP part plan-of-care perform transthoracic echocardiography surveillance intracardiac air embolus 2 ) record aspects past medical history may potentially contribute increase risk systemic venous air embolus . This evaluation present literature primary end-point study would determine frequency venous air embolus associate ERCP occurs . All individual meet inclusion criterion approach consent pre-operative area prior plan procedure ( ERCP ) . Their past medical history review patient special attention place particular co-morbid condition might relate phenomenon include limited : portal hypertension , cirrhosis , portal vein thrombosis , recent liver biopsy . The patient proceed procedure room plan patient place left lateral decubitus position induce anesthesia . An echocardiography-trained anesthesiologist perform transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) concurrently gastroenterologist perform ERCP . We plan conduct serial image least every ten fifteen minute throughout ERCP often need . At conclusion procedure ( ERCP ) significant finding TTE patient return supine position take recovery room . The write record TTE enter study database within separate research chart . In event TTE show presence intracardiac air embolus procedure member study group perform TTE notify endoscopist anesthesia provider finding finding significant enough require change patient 's medical care . Reference algorithm make case available online need . Unless moderate severe embolic event occurs , finding communicate gastroenterologist blind result maintain research chart . The purpose keep clinically insignificant embolus report patient 's medical record . One key component evaluation determine whether presence air embolus occur , negative effect function subject 's cardiovascular system . Our propose evaluation myocardium use transthoracic echocardiography include evaluation leave ventricle , right ventricle pulmonary artery pressure . In event hemodynamic instability result impaired function right leave ventricle , evaluation include measurement follow parameter assist determination problem : 1 . Right ventricular function , specifically tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE presence hemodynamic change . 2 . Left ventricular function , specifically diastolic function , systolic function myocardial performance index . 3 . Pulmonary artery systolic pressure , via evaluation tricuspid regurgitant jet maximum velocity use modify Bernoulli equation . 4 . Presence new right-to-left intracardiac shunt bow intraatrial septum right-to-left indicate new increase right atrial pressure . 5 . Significant change hemodynamic status would indicate subject effective filling ejection leave ventricle support perfuse blood pressure . This may manifest hypotension and/or tachyarrhythmias standard intraoperative monitoring . As protocol evaluate frequency degree air embolization systemic venous system performance endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , follow four subgroup identify help define identification treatment subject enrol IRB 238-11 . Each category ) criterion visual quantification air see b ) cardiac function hemodynamic change see finally c ) plan intervention need : 1 . No air embolism : 1 . No visualized air emboli procedure . 2 . Subjects hemodynamic myocardial change attributable occurrence venous air embolus . 3 . No change would make standard care research subject result absence finding . Findings enter research chart . 2 . Small air embolism : 1 . A small , identifiable quantity air visualize form large collection obscure visualization far-field . 2 . Subjects change myocardial function maintenance hemodynamics . 3 . The subject would undergo follow-up evaluation member study group conclusion normal post-op recovery period . No additional time would require evaluation documentation hemodynamic stability follow-up echocardiography finding would record research chart . 3 . Moderate air embolism : 1 . Identifiable intracardiac air within heart obscure far-field due size cause sharp demarcation blood/gas interface . 2 . Subjects document impairment myocardial function and/or hemodynamics compare baseline require emergency resuscitation correct . 3 . The subject would remain left lateral decubitus ( `` safe position '' individual suspect confirm venous air embolism ) four hour . Laboratory test include cardiac enzyme may obtain member study team re-evaluate transthoracic echocardiography . If baseline function hemodynamics return , subject concludes recovery period per normal circumstance ERCP . In event subject persistent intracardiac air , impaired myocardial function hemodynamic instability , would recommend subject stay observation telemetry monitor evaluation need . 4 . Large air embolism : 1 . Identifiable intracardiac air collect large enough bubble cause sharp demarcation blood/gas interface obscure far-field . 2 . Left and/or right ventricular failure hemodynamic collapse . 3 . The subject would require emergency resuscitation ACLS protocol addition placement invasive monitor evaluation . Attempts extract intracardiac air use central venous catheter make need intubation transfer ICU monitoring . Consultation hyperbaric oxygen therapy would pursue measure would take recover hemodynamic function .</detailed_description>
