The primary trial objective determine clinical effective dose orally administer pyronaridine/artesunate ( 3:1 weight/weight ) ratio treatment patient acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria use PCR-corrected adequate clinical parasitological response ( ACPR ) Day 28 primary endpoint . Secondary trial objective determine safety daily dose three ( 3 ) day pyronaridine+artesunate ( 3:1 ) combination male female patient uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria explore possible ethnic difference safety efficacy two region : South East Asia Africa</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Dose-ranging Study Pyronaridine/Artesunate Adults Patients With Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design double-blind , multicentre , randomise , parallel group , dose-finding study efficacy , safety tolerability three day regimen combination pyronaridine/artesunate ratio 3:1 . Pharmacokinetics pyronaridine estimate separate sub-study . Patients recruit 5 7 study site randomise one 3 treatment group : Group A : pyronaridine+artesunate PA ( PP 6 mg/kg + AS 2 mg/kg ) Group B : pyronaridine+artesunate PA ( PP 9 mg/kg + AS 3 mg/kg ) Group C : pyronaridine+artesunate PA ( PP 12 mg/kg + AS 4 mg/kg ) Randomisation plan balance within study site across 3 study group pre-assigned treatment block . Patients withdraw early reason replace . Patients ideally hospitalise least 4 day require remain vicinity trial site minimum 7 day start treatment , fever parasite clear : 2 negative reading ( fever and/or slide ) take 8 hour apart plus another negative ( fever and/or slide ) 24 hour later . The patient return study site , make available , scheduled weekly follow visit discharge Day 42 . Patients remain study 42 day follow first dose ( D0 ) . In case adverse event report unresolved visit Day 42 , patient follow 30 day , resolution event .</detailed_description>
