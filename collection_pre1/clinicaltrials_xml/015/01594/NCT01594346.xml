	<detailed_description>Alzheimer disease ( AD ) continue serious health problem face age person Down syndrome . AD also major public health concern age general population . With increase life expectancy dramatic increase prevalence AD case , pose significant increase burden health care system individual provider care . Persons Down syndrome uniquely vulnerable form Alzheimer disease indistinguishable sporadic variety affect age individual general population . Oxidative damage highly plausible mechanism pathogenesis disease due overexpression superoxide dismutase , associate gene locate chromosome 21 , present triplicate Down syndrome genotype . For last six year , conduct clinical trial determine safety efficacy anti-oxidant Vitamin E slow cognitive functional decline associate dementia AD among individual DS . The study randomize , double-blind trial , stratify two-arm parallel design . The subject medically stable individual 50 year age old time screen . Among randomized treatment arm , vitamin E take form 1000 IU capsule 36 month . Each subject evaluate every 6 month 3 year . The primary outcome Brief Praxis Test ( BPT ) , well-suited quantify cognitive decline population . The target enrollment 350 person estimate sufficient provide adequate statistical power detect slow one-third rate cognitive decline vitamin E treatment . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) trial include 4 physician , statistician expertise clinical trial . Each DSMB member receives report serious adverse event ( SAE ) flow basis , statistically summary unblinded safety data -- include death , adverse event vital sign -- prior meeting DSMB . The recent DSMB meeting take place February 23,2010 . The timeline study completion : recruitment study sample ( N=350 ) complete 12/31/2008 ; final 36-month evaluation take place 04/2010 ; statistical analysis final report result expect completed 12/31/2010 .</detailed_description>
