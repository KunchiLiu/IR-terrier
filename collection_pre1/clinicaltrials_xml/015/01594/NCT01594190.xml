	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause adult disability Europe United States second lead cause death worldwide affect 10,000 Danes year . Studies late stationary phase stroke show physical rehabilitation great importance survival physical ability patient , however many study show patient lie sit next bed hospitalization 88.5 % daily hour . Physical activity stroke patient never previously measure immediately debut symptom ; furthermore knowledge optimal dose physical rehabilitation patient . Accelerometers , small measuring device , relatively new way measure physical activity precisely , hence possible obtain objective measure active stroke patient first week admission . The accelerometer measure variable voltage , depend range intensity movement . They measure movement dependent placement accelerometer , instance hip , arm leg . Studies confirm reliability , even patient abnormal gait , stroke patient . Another approach study effect physical activity rehabilitation examination biomarkers . Studies show biomarkers release physical activity inhibit biomarkers release tissue injury brain , see stroke . These brain biomarkers cause damage study show high level , high damage . It therefore obvious examine whether physical activity rehabilitation regulate destructive process patient stroke . Clarification optimal dose physical activity stroke patient immediately debut symptom examination biochemical aspect physical rehabilitation well optimal dose physical rehabilitation great importance many patient , relative well great socioeconomic importance . The purpose project investigate dose ( 15 vs. 2 x 30 minute ) physical activity weight-bearing treadmill first 5 day admission ischemic stroke , give patient best improvement neurological dysfunction .</brief_summary>
