	<brief_summary>A prospective multicenter trial start Korea investigate treatment efficacy Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) plus Medroxyprogesterone Acetate ( MPA ) Young Women Early Stage Endometrial Cancer . The standard treatment endometrial cancer total hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , peritoneal cytology , lymph node dissection . However , young patient desire preserve potential fertility may find standard treatment difficult accept . Therefore , conservative treatment patient remain challenge . A number study report effectiveness hormonal therapy use systemic progestin woman clinically diagnose early endometrial adenocarcinoma stage IA , grade 1 , want maintain reproductive potential . In addition , several recent study report use LNG-IUS treat patient high risk perioperative complication tolerate systemic progesterone adverse effect . Nevertheless , prospective multicenter trial investigate effectiveness treatment systemic progesterone combination intrauterine progesterone young woman endometrial cancer . Therefore , investigator conduct prospective trial treatment presumably early-stage grade 1 endometrial cancer young woman desire preserve fertility use oral MPA combination LNG-IUS . Young patient histologically confirm grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma presumably confine endometrium , desire preserve fertility potential go LNG-IUS insertion administer MPA dosage 500 mg/d concurrently . Follow-up treatment response assessment implement 3-month interval office endometrial aspiration biopsy LNG-IUS place dilatation curettage removal LNG-IUS . The primary endpoint response rate . Secondary endpoint estimate consistency result office endometrial aspiration biopsy dilatation curettage ( D &amp; C ) procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : This prospective study aim analyze treatment efficacy LNG-IUS plus MPA Young Women Early Stage Endometrial Cancer analyze diagnostic accuracy office endometrial aspiration biopsy LNG-IUS place compare dilatation curettage removal LNG-IUS . ENDPOINTS : The primary endpoint study response rate . Secondary endpoint estimate consistency result office endometrial aspiration biopsy dilatation curettage ( D &amp; C ) procedure . STUDY SETTING AND PROTOCOL REVIEW : This study single arm , prospective multi-institutional study . Its protocol approve Institutional Review Board clinical trial institution . PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL PERIOD : Patient Selection Enrollment : 24 month IRB approval clinical trial Institution . TREATMENT METHODS : Patients histologically confirm grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma presumably confine endometrium go LNG-IUS insertion administer MPA dosage 500 mg/day concurrently . Follow-up treatment response assessment implement 3-month interval transvaginal ultrasonography , endometrial aspiration biopsy LNG-IUS place D &amp; C removal LNG-IUS . The biopsy finding compare . INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 1 . General Name/Brand name : Mirena - SCHERING Active ingredient : levonorgestrel 52mg Description : Mirena hormone-releasing T-shaped intrauterine system . A removal thread attach loop end vertical stem T-body . 2 . General Name/Brand name : Farlutal tab . 500mg/ Pfizer Active ingredient : Medroxyprogesterone Acetate PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECT 39 patient biopsy proven grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma presumably confine endometrium . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective study estimate treatment efficacy oral MPA combination LNG-IUS early stage endometrial cancer term response rate . The sample size need estimation would 39 patient consider 10 % follow-up loss . The Secondary objective estimate consistency office endometrial aspiration biopsy D &amp; C . Kappa statistic use</detailed_description>
