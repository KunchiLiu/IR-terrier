	<brief_summary>Dietary pulse , commonly know `` legume '' , generally recognize healthy component diet . Canada 's Food Guide encourage consumption meat alternative , bean `` often '' ; dietary guideline Americans recommend consumption 3 cup legumes per week . However , still remain insufficient information usefulness food protect heart health . To improve evidence-based guidance non-oil-seed pulse recommendation , investigator propose conduct systematic review clinical study assess effect eat pulse exchange food measure heart disease risk blood sugar control human . The systematic review process allow combine result many small study order arrive pool estimate , similar weighted average , true effect . The investigator able explore whether eat pulse different effect men woman , different age group , people high normal sugar blood fat level , whether effect pulse depend much/often eaten .

	<detailed_description>Background : Dietary non-oil-seed pulse ( chick pea , bean , lentil , pea ) source slowly digestible carbohydrate , vegetable protein , fibre . Canada 's Food Guide encourage consumption meat alternative , bean , `` often '' , dietary guideline Americans recommend 3-cups legume per week . The American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend consumption legume least twice week cardiovascular health , European ( EASD ) , Canadian ( CDA ) , American ( ADA ) Diabetes Associations recommend consumption dietary pulse mean improve diabetes control . The evidence recommendation base , however , grade low . The evidence support cardiovascular risk reduction health claim pulse also deem insufficient , obesity , blood pressure , dyslipidemia guideline address pulse recommendation . Need review : The low-grade evidence heart diabetes association recommendation base lack data support health claim cardiometabolic recommendation represent urgent call strong evidence . A systematic review meta-analysis control feeding trial remain `` Gold Standard '' evidence nutrition guideline development . Objectives : To provide evidence-based guidance public health policy , health claim , nutrition guideline relate dietary pulse , conduct series systematic review meta-analyses ( knowledge synthesis ) control feed trial assess effect pulse marker cardiometabolic risk human , specifically lipid endpoint therapeutic target , glycemia , blood pressure body weight . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Intervention trial investigate effect exchange dietary pulse diet cardiometabolic risk outcome human include . Studies &lt; 3-wks duration , lack control , report non-isocaloric comparison exclude . Data extraction : Independent investigator ( ≥2 ) extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , pulse form , dose , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean±SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Risk bias study quality assess use risk bias tool Heyland Methodological Quality Score ( MQS ) , respectively . Outcomes : The 4 propose analysis assess set outcomes related different area cardiometabolic control : ( 1 ) lipid control ( LDL-C , ApoB , TC : HDL , non-HDL-C , ApoB : ApoA-1 ) , ( 2 ) glycemic control ( fast glucose insulin , HOMA-IR , glycated blood protein ) , ( 3 ) body weight control , ( 4 ) blood pressure control . Where data change-from-baseline difference end difference equally available , use difference change baseline primary end point analysis . Data synthesis : Separate pool analysis stratify underlying disease status conduct area metabolic control use Generic Inverse Variance method random effect model . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochrane 's Q quantify I2 . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analysis include pulse type , pulse dose , duration follow-up , absolute change saturate fat intake , absolute change dietary fibre intake , design ( crossover , parallel ) , study quality , baseline endpoint value . An priori subgroup analysis absolute change sodium intake replace absolute change saturate fat intake blood pressure analysis . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analysis ( e.g . age , sex , level feed control [ metabolic , supplement , dietary advice ] , washout crossover trial , energy balance background diet , composition background diet [ total % energy fat , carbohydrate , protein ] , change cholesterol intake , absolute change glycemic index , etc. ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . Publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot application Egger 's Begg 's test . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Four Knowledge Users also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Preliminary finding : We conduct systematic review meta-analysis effect dietary pulse glycemic control 41 control feeding trial . We find pulse alone low-glycemic index high-fibre diet improve marker glycemic control . Although improvement clinically significant , come expense substantial inter-study heterogeneity . Knowledge translation preliminary project already begin . It provide rationale large trial effect pulse type 2 diabetes address identify source heterogeneity use development 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) Nutrition Therapy . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate effect dietary pulse cardiometabolic risk , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim improve health outcome inform healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research .</detailed_description>
