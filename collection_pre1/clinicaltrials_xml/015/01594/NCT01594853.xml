	<brief_title>Exercise Study Function Pathology Women With X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X-ALD ) , [ sex-linked ] progressive neurodegenerative disease , cause defect ABCD1 gene . The disease express multiple way , common adult form adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) , result slowly progressive change muscle tone weakness , sensory loss , dysfunction autonomic nervous system . In previous study investigator link abnormality [ brain/spinal cord ] low extremity weakness men AMN ; however , study evaluate relationship woman carrier ( i.e. , woman AMN ) . It unknown , woman AMN , pattern damage brain spinal cord relate disability pattern predict responsiveness treatment . The investigator hypothesize use magnetization transfer ( MT ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , two magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) modality , track particular change brain spinal cord predict disability additionally , likely respond best training regimen . The investigator expect advanced image technique sensitive accurate quantitative measure clinical motor function woman great loss spinal cord compare brain benefit training improve disability . To test hypothesis , woman AMN receive MRI scan baseline complete measure global walk low extremity impairment vibration sensation , spasticity , strength three time-points : baseline , 12 week , 18 week baseline . The group participate resistive training program 12 week . MRI data correlate change time measure impairment determine relationship . The link information important well define disability woman AMN also help guide physician rehabilitation therapist predict likely respond rehabilitative intervention , well optimize effect future pharmacological intervention .</detailed_description>
