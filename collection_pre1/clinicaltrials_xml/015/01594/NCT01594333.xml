	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While inflammation contributes crucially atherothrombosis , unknown whether inhibition inflammation per se low vascular event rate . The primary aim Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial ( CIRT ) directly test inflammatory hypothesis atherothrombosis evaluate whether low-dose methotrexate ( LDM ) reduce rate myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death among stable coronary artery disease patient type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome , condition associate enhanced pro-inflammatory response . CIRT randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center , event-driven trial randomize 7,000 men woman United States Canada . Following five- six-week open-label run-in ( maximum 8 week ) , eligible participant either suffer document myocardial infarction past angiographically demonstrate multivessel coronary artery disease past randomly allocate three four year period usual care plus placebo usual care plus LDM . The target methotrexate dose among allocated active therapy 15 20 mg po per week , dose within range commonly use treatment rheumatoid arthritis . All study participant additionally receive 1.0 mg oral folate take daily six day per week . LDM complication minimize education program investigator coordinator , enhance communication study participant , limit enrollment evidence malignancy , hepatitis , renal dysfunction , chronic infection , pulmonary disease , risk factor toxicity ; conduct initial 5- 6-week active-therapy run-in ( maximum 8 week ) design eliminate individual either intolerant unable adhere treatment randomization ; regular monitoring liver function hematologic index use centralized methodology design ensure participant safety , allow dose adjustment maintain study blind , provide efficient method address issue compliance follow-up cost-effective centralized basis . The primary trial endpoint rate myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death . Secondary tertiary endpoint include all-cause mortality , coronary revascularization , incident congestive heart failure , incident peripheral artery disease , incident venous thrombosis , clinically significant aortic stenosis , incident atrial fibrillation , incident diabetes among metabolic syndrome diabetes study entry , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) control among diabetes study entry . The trial event drive absence extreme effect , trial conclude accrual least 530 primary endpoint , effect estimate provide 90 percent power detect 25 percent relative risk reduction . The potential clinical impact CIRT broad sufficient power directly address core issue inflammatory hypothesis atherothrombosis , thus , successful , open major new direction cardiovascular treatment .</detailed_description>
