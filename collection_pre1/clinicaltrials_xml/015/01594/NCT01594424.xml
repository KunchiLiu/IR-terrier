	<brief_summary>In Phase I/II trial , 10 highly sensitized patient enter informed consent receive Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) 2 gm/kg + Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg x 5 dos day 15 , 45 , 75 , 105 , 119 , 135 , 149 . If robust reduction anti-HLA antibody see , patient progress kidney transplantation `` acceptable '' crossmatch achieve living donor ( LD ) decease donor ( DD ) . Those receive transplant also receive Tocilizumab infusion monthly X7 dose post-transplant . All subject intensive monitoring Donor Specific Antibodies ( DSA ) , viral PCRs , routine post-transplant lab . At 6 month post-transplant , retain transplant kidney protocol biopsy .</brief_summary>
