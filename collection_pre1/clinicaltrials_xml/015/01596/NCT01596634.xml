	<brief_title>Bovine Lactoferrin Reducing Taste Disturbances Patients With Colorectal Cancer Receiving Oxaliplatin-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact lactoferrin ( bovine lactoferrin ) supplementation self-reported taste smell disturbances patient colorectal cancer receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation baseline lipid peroxidation byproduct saliva patient measure thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance ( TBARs ) assay . II . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation ability patient generate increase lipid peroxidation byproduct challenge weak iron contain solution . III . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation self-reported general quality life specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issue patient establish chemotherapy-induced taste disturbance . IV . To assess incidence vitamin D deficiency patient oxaliplatin-based therapy induce taste change OUTLINE : Patients receive bovine lactoferrin orally ( PO ) ( rinse tablet ) thrice daily ( TID ) 1 month . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 4 week .</detailed_description>
