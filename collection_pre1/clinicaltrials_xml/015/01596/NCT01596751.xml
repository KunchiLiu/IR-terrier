	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Study PLX 3397 Eribulin Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This nonrandomized , open label phase Ib/II study evaluate safety efficacy eribulin combination PLX3397 , novel CSF1 inhibitor , patient metastatic breast cancer . The phase II portion trial limit patient triple negative disease . The phase I portion trial dose escalation PLX3397 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PLX3397 give combination standard dose eribulin . Patients enrol cohort three , use dose level plan outline statistical section , 6 patient enrol MTD . All patient accessible tumor require tumor biopsy study start start therapy . Pharmacokinetics PLX3397 eribulin , blood level CSF1 obtain outline section 14 . To allow rapid accrual phase Ib , earlier start phase II trial , patient enrol phase I hormone receptor positive negative disease , line therapy assume eligibility criterion otherwise meet . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) define treatment-related toxicity meeting criterion occur within first 21 day combination therapy . Patients must receive least 14 day PLX3397 2 dos eribulin first cycle order consider evaluable DLT ( unless miss dos due DLT ) . Patients cohort follow least 3 week ( one full cycle ) open accrual next dose level . If one patient cohort develop DLT , additional 3 patient enrolled level . If additional toxicity occur six patient , particular dose would use phase II trial , next high dose would consider MTD . A minimum 12 maximum 24 patient enrolled phase I study . The phase II trial open last patient phase I study follow least 3 week . The phase II portion trial evaluate PFS patient TNBC treat PLX3397 eribulin , use dose PLX3397 determine phase Ib study two-step design . Please see statistical section detail regard enrollment statistical design . Treatment precede 5 7 day lead-in phase , patient take PLX3397 alone daily . Patients accessible tumor undergo core biopsy tumor start PLX3397 treatment , fine needle aspiration core biopsy perform day day start eribulin ( day -1 day 0 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer document progressive disease . Patients stable brain metastasis eligible trial . At least one prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic breast cancer . Prior treatment must discontinue least 2 week treatment start . Concomitant therapy bisphosphonates allow . Stable dose coumadin anticoagulation allow , provide anticoagulation safely hold INR within normal range purpose tumor biopsy . LMWH prefer method anticoagulation . PT/INR PTT within institutional normal limit within two week initial biopsy . Measurable disease , define RECIST guideline evaluable disease . Bone metastases must evaluable . Disease amenable core biopsy . Patients pulmonary metastasis site disease may enroll trial undergo biopsy . For Phase I : patient HER2 overexpressing disease must previously treat trastuzumab . Patients HER2 overexpressing disease eligible Phase II trial . Age eighteen year older . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . Life expectancy &gt; /= 12 week . Patients &lt; grade 1 peripheral neuropathy eligible trial . Adequate bone marrow reserve : ANC &gt; /= 1000 , platelet &gt; /= 100,000 . Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5x upper limit normal OR calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min . Sodium , potassium , chloride level within institutional normal limit . Adequate hepatic function : AST ALT &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN , total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5x upper limit normal . In patient liver dysfunction due hepatic metastasis , AST ALT permit &lt; /= 5 time ULN . At baseline : EF ≥ 50 % , evidence QT prolongation , history congenital long QT syndrome , use drug know increase risk Torsades de Point patient may eligible study drug change another agent less risk ( change citalopram alternate antidepressant ) . Able take oral medication maintain hydration . Ability give write informed consent willingness comply requirement protocol Women childbearing potential must agree use effective method birth control treatment six month receive last dose study drug Specific inclusion criterion Phase II • Patients enrol phase II portion trial must ER , PR HER2 negative disease define less 10 % stain ER PR , HER2 amplify FISH , 01 % IHC , 2+ IHC evidence amplification FISH . Treatment another chemotherapy hormonal therapy within past 2 week . Treatment trastuzumab , bevacizumab target therapy within past 2 week . Concurrent treatment radiotherapy . Ongoing treatment investigational therapy . Prior treatment eribulin Severe , concurrent illness include congestive heart failure , significant cardiac disease uncontrolled hypertension , would likely prevent patient able comply study protocol . Inadequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic function define , active coagulopathy precludes tissue biopsy . Pregnant lactate woman woman childbearing potential use effective method birth control . Women childbearing potential must undergo serum pregnancy test within seven day start study drug .</criteria>
