	<detailed_description>Graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) one major cause death patient undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . Despite prophylactic measure , incidence acute GVHD estimate 40-60 % among patient receive allograft HLA-identical sibling donor , may even reach 75 % patient receive HLA-matched unrelated graft . Approximately 20 % patient develop severe variant disease tight association severity GVHD transplantation-related-mortality . The treatment GVHD largely base high dose steroid regimen associate long term morbidity mortality . In subgroup patient steroid-refractory slowly resolve GVHD , currently recommendations best time taper steroid dose case resolution disease , add second line medication , case non-resolving progression symptom . 18F-FDG PET/CT ( 2- [ fluorine-18 ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose , Positron emission tomography- CT ) noninvasive technique allow quantify precisely localize 18F-FDG uptake entire body . 18F-FDG uptake cause increased local metabolic activity . Such increased uptake describe neoplastic lesion also inflammatory lesion ( 2 ) . In condition , uptake correlated local stimulation tumor necrosis factor , monocyte prim activation . A physiologic variable uptake may observe bowel , especially cecum , limited use PET inflammatory bowel disease . The advantage combine PET CT device lead significant improvement interpretation bowel area , greatly reduce number false-positive finding gastrointestinal tract . CT-PET recently evaluate center diagnostic tool Crohn disease . In study , CT-PET good correlation FDG uptake severity Crohn disease . In acute GVHD setting , study report small cohort suggest correlation CT-PET finding , FDG uptake , diagnosis lower gut acute GVHD . In study , aim evaluate characterize correlation CT-PET finding patient suspect acute GVHD , disease course .</detailed_description>
