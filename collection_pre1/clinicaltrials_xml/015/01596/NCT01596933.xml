	<brief_summary>Cancer cachexia complex metabolic process affect 80 % patient suffer advanced-stage cancer . Moreover , 20 40 % cancer death cause directly cachexia . Head neck ( H &amp; N ) cancer patient nutritionally vulnerable since tumour localisation interfere food intake , since alcohol tobacco abuse - two etiological risk factor H &amp; N cancer - associate nutritional deficit , since intensive treatment lead progressive weight loss . Recently , omega-3 fatty acid gain interest beneficial effect several disease . Moreover , nutritional supplementation enrich omega-3 FA could potentially maintain body weight cancer patient undergo intensive treatment . Aims In study , investigator want evaluate use omega-3 FA supplementation nutritional investigator would like identify potential risk factor , biomarkers objective measurement tool predict therapy-induced cachexia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Omega-3 Supplements Prevention Cachexia Head Neck Cancer Treated With Radio ( Chemo ) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design A prospective , placebo-controlled trial . H &amp; N cancer patient eligible curative treatment randomise receive standard nutritional support placebo ( 15ml/day Sunflower oil , control group ) nutritional support omega-3 FA supplementation ( 15ml/day Echium oil , experimental group ) radio ( chemo ) therapy . All patient undergo nutritional screening ( Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment ) , quality life evaluation ( EORTC QLQ C30 &amp; HN35 ) ask keep 3-day food diary start therapy , 4th week end therapy . Body composition grip strength measure bio-electrical impedance ( BIA ) analysis , Dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) JAMAR® hydraulic hand dynamometer baseline , 4th week therapy . Blood sample collect baseline , 4th week therapy ( 1 ) verify compliance rate measure fatty acid concentration , ( 2 ) verify presence potential biomarkers predict cachexia ( 3 ) detect presence SNPs associate severe acute dysphagia . Demographic data , tumour characteristic therapy-related toxicity also collect . Population Newly diagnose non-metastatic ( stage I-IVB ) head neck cancer patient ( ≥18 older ) eligible curative primary adjuvant radiotherapy without systemic therapy</detailed_description>
