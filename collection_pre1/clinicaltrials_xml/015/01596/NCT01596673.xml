	<brief_title>A Study Assess Abuse Potential Hydrocodone Extended-Release Tablet Recreational Opioid Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydrocodone bitartrate semisynthetic opioid analgesic antitussive . Hydrocodone widely use various indication similar codeine , primarily relief moderate moderately severe pain . For treatment pain United States , hydrocodone currently available immediate-release ( IR ) product combination medication acetaminophen ibuprofen . The extended-release ( ER ) formulation test study design resistant dose dump alcohol rapid release hydrocodone tampering . The study consist 3 phase : A , B , C. Phase A screen phase subject eligibility confirm ( Visit 1 ) . Subjects eligible enter Phase B , double-blind , 2-period crossover design ( Visit 2 ) follow Phase C , double-blind 4-period crossover design ( Visits 3 6 ) . Phase B randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-treatment , 2- period crossover portion study design ensure subject tolerate 45-mg dose hydrocodone subject discriminate effect hydrocodone effect placebo . Subjects arrive study center day prior first study drug administration remain study center minimum 24 hour second study drug administration phase B . After review inclusion/exclusion criterion check-in procedure ( include Naloxone Challenge ) , eligible subject randomly assign one 2 treatment sequence . For subject qualify continue phase C , minimum 7-day washout period second dose phase B first dose phase C. Phase C randomize , double-blind , triple-dummy , placebo-controlled , 4-period crossover portion study . Subjects arrive study center day prior study drug administration phase C remain study center 72 hour study drug administration period . Eligible subject randomly assign 1 4 treatment group . Each dose phase C separate minimum 14 day washout period . All subject ( include withdraw study ) ask return study center follow-up visit approximately 48 72 hour discharge study center follow final dose study drug .</detailed_description>
