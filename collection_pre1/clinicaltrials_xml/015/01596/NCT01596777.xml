	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence opioid use consequently , opioid-induced bowel dysfunction prompt interest identify effective treatment option . Until , treatment opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) view extension constipation general . Traditional therapy constipation bulk agent , stool softener , stimulant laxative , osmotic agent commonly utilized , effect therapy nonspecific often generate diarrhea cramp drug cause severe side effect . Furthermore , conventional measure sometimes insufficient patient , especially require increase dos opioids . Opioid-induced constipation predominantly mediate gastrointestinal μ-opioid receptor . Selective blockade peripheral receptor might relieve constipation without compromise centrally mediate effect opioid analgesia precipitate withdrawal . Naloxone competitive antagonist opioid receptor inside outside central nervous system use solution injection treatment opioid overdose . When administer orally , reduce opioid-induced constipation due local action gut . Another way prevent central action use opioid antagonist ca n't penetrate blood-brain barrier methylnaltrexone alvimopan . Their antagonism μ-opioid receptor gastrointestinal tract seem reverse opioid-induced gut hypomotility . It assume methylnaltrexone oral administration influence intestinal motility local blockade opioid receptor along luminal surface gut . Because methylnaltrexone seem absorption window proximal small intestine cause low activity P-glycoprotein region ( similar quaternary compound , eg . trospium chloride ) , immediate release ( uncoated ) methylnaltrexone well absorbed form small intestine might therefore less active enteric-coated drug . However , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data oral methylnaltrexone preliminarily far . Furthermore , intestinal transit time measure use lactulose probe compound laxative effect . Therefore , follow clinical study initiate proof concept control clinical trial healthy subject , whether methylnaltrexone antagonize loperamide induced delay oro-cecal whole-gut transit time oral administration immediate extend release capsule comparison subcutaneous administration . Loperamide opioid agonist act µ-receptors myenteric plexus . It affect central nervous system like opioids . Loperamide significantly prolong mouth-to-cecum transit time evaluate lactulose hydrogen breath test . This effect may antagonize concomitant administration naloxone .</detailed_description>
