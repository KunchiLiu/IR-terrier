	<brief_summary>Purpose determine effect ephedrine caffeine , metabolic rate weight loss bariatric surgery . Approximately 40 % patient struggle weight loss rate , metabolic rate , bariatric surgery , least 30 % previously develop low metabolic rate surgery . Metabolic rate speed calorie burn . The few calorie eat calorie burn , rapidly weight lose . It possible despite low calorie intake follow bariatric surgery metabolic rate decrease much weight decrease even intake reduced 1000 calorie per day . Ephedrine medicine use commonly treat asthma , difficulty breathing , wheeze . However , 40 year ago report scientific study ephedrine increase weight loss patient low calorie diet increase amount calorie burn . Combining caffeine ephedrine make ephedrine work efficiently ( weight loss time ) . Many study show effect ephedrine weight loss begin 1974 patient food diet . Ephedrine use various strengths number different combination show effective safe , especially directed physician . There one study ephedrine use patient bariatric surgery . In study , patient medical staff know take ephedrine ( i.e. , `` blind '' ) . The patient lose weight measure low metabolic rate treat ephedrine . The patient take ephedrine lose weight surgery take ephedrine . While significant finding , study design best test effect ephedrine . The best test neither patient medical staff know patient take active drug ( double blind ) . All patient enrol Research Study receive capsule contain either ephedrine caffeine ( active drug ) identical capsule active ingredient ( call `` placebo '' ) . Neither group patient know set capsule receive . The expected duration treatment Study 7 month day surgery . This single site study . All patient gastric bypass perform Oregon Weight Loss Surgery Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital . The investigator expect study 200 patient 100 receive study drug ( ephedrine caffeine capsule ) 100 receive placebo ( inactive ingredient identical capsule ) approximately 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Objectives : The primary objective apply effective medical weight loss treatment post bariatric surgery patient enhance weight loss stimulation thermogenesis lipolysis retention lean body mass . This treatment use ephedrine phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( caffeine theophylline ) extensively document safe effective medical weight loss set apply post-bariatric surgery patient placebo control , double blind , randomize study . From preliminary study treatment effective , especially treatment post-surgical patient continue difficulty lose weight despite good activity level significant calorie restriction . Clinical Relevance : Raum others treat patient present low metabolic rate medical bariatric surgery induce weight loss many year ephedrine combination caffeine and/or theophylline . All literature outline last 40 year conduct medical weight loss . There randomized trial surgical patient . Abstracts expert opinion paper publish without randomization blinding . Ephedrine become controversial despite considerable evidence safe effective treatment airway resistance ( asthma ) 50 year , use medical weight loss ( stimulate REE prevent loss lean body mass ) since 1974 . An association non-regulated food additive , ephedra spark initial problem inappropriate dosing , lack physician supervision patient selection sensationalism lay press unsupported peer-reviewed study contradict previous favorable study . Secondly , use ephedrine pseudoephedrine substrate illegal manufacture methamphetamine , cause aura unreasoned apprehension . Because ephedrine caffeine theophylline one drug combination potentially reverse low REE allow successful weight loss follow bariatric surgery , randomize , control study need determine effect statistically clinically significant patient bariatric surgery . SPECIFIC AIMS Background Current Research Following bariatric surgery , metabolic rate decrease secondary decrease sympathetic activity lean body mass prevent optimal weight loss ( 1-3 ) . Patients reach `` plateau '' weight loss medical surgical well recognize . The plateau reach longer significant difference calorie burn calorie consume . The equation modify either end . High calorie intake , far , common reason give lack weight loss . The advice provide decrease calorie intake . However , large subgroup individual whose metabolic rate ( measure Resting Energy Expenditure - REE Resting Metabolic Rate - RMR ) decrease caloric intake remain low . Raum ( 3 ) routinely measure REE bariatric surgery patient 10 year . A low REE commonly associate reduced weight loss rate . Hundreds patient find REEs significantly depress normal ( 90-s100 % ) range 45 % 80 % mean 65 % . These patient deficit 500 1000 kcal per day would burn normal REE . Some patient must consume less 700 1000 kcal/day maintain weight . The method increase REE , sympathetic activity , brown adipose tissue activity include exercise , several drug include catechin ( green tea ) , caffeine theophylline ephedrine , capsaicin ( 1 ) . Many clinical trial demonstrate effect ephedrine weight loss ( 4-7 ) . A significant effect ephedrine increase metabolism think one mechanism weight loss . Stimulation brown adipose tissue think contribute 15 % increase thermogenesis remainder due thermogenesis muscle ( 8 ) . Combinations ephedrine methylxanthines ( caffeine and/or theophylline ) note even effective raise metabolic rate . These effect notable post-obese patient lose weight , depressed metabolic rate . REE increase 8 % post-obese effect lean subject . In previously obese subject , ephedrine-methylxanthine combination normalize defective thermogenic response meal ( 9 ) . In 24-week trial 20 mg ephedrine 200 mg caffeine tid randomize placebo . The ephedrine/caffeine group lose 17.5 % body weight 25 % weight loss attribute thermogenesis ( 10 ) . The thermogenic effect ephedrine may lose early treatment restore addition aminophylline ( 11 ) . The effect ephedrine body composition study . Two group give low calorie diet . Placebo Ephedrine combination without methylxanthines and/or aspirin ( 110 mg tid ) 8 week trial demonstrate side effect . The ephedrine group lose 4.5 kg fat 2.5 kg less lean placebo , significant difference . REE fell 13 % placebo group , 8 % ephedrine group ( 18 ) . A examples literature highlight reflect similar study find extensive review ephedrine weight loss ( 19-26 ) , energy balance thermogenesis ( 27,28 ) . Considerable recent controversy safety ephedrine come pas due widespread use herbal food additive , ephedra , market widely begin late 1990s . Ephedrine use without controversy 1960s time . Many anecdotal report circulate , include 18,000 case report . These 550 trial review meta-analysis ( 30 ) . Of report le 10 % trial could scientifically assess 22 consisted placebo combination ephedrine , ephedra , caffeine herb . These remain study demonstrate 2.2 3.6 fold increase one follow group subjective complaint , psychological , gastrointestinal , autonomic symptom , and/or palpitation . Presumably 90 % actual trial test highlight symptom . Other paper ( 31-33 ) review various type report ( design study ) describe instance acute intoxication result stroke , heart attack , seizure even death . Because uncontrolled nature data report , dos , combination drug , frequency duration exposure unknown , could state whether association ephedra possible probable . Other research observe significant adverse effect temporary minor effect ephedra , ephedrine caffeine ( 13 , 14 , 34-37 ) . These study double-blind placebo control select population . Multiple clinical weight loss trial measure chronic acute effect combination ephedrine ( 30 , 60 150 mg per day ) caffeine ( 300 600 mg per day ) 180 subject 24 week ( 10 , 12-15 ) . Acutely , mean arterial pressure increase 9 mm/Hg pulse 7 beat per minute . By 8 week side effect tremor , insomnia , dizziness blood pressure initially note ephedrine equal placebo . In study side effect see high dose 50 mg tid ( 16 ) . No adverse effect note dose ephedrine 25 mg caffeine 200 mg tid 10 day cardiovascular function measure thoracic bio-impedance , automatic sphygmomanometry , continuous electrocardiographic record ergometric exercise ( 17 ) . The difference two contrast set data demonstrates unregulated use ephedrine-containing compound unknown potentially lethal dos susceptible population encourage . But preparation dosage know controlled , give appropriately select population , ephedrine caffeine safe effective . References available request . EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN Patients medically clear gastric bypass surgery meet inclusion criterion eliminate exclusion criterion offer opportunity enroll study . Patients enrol study , IRB consent obtain , randomized treatment control group prior surgery . Patients follow usual preoperative postoperative surgical medical investigation care . This include baseline rest energy expenditure ( REE ) body composition measurement ( BC ) surgery . Study visit usually occur time normal follow visit vital sign weight obtain . Patients begin take ephedrine/caffeine placebo capsule 5 week surgery gradual tapering dose upward begin one capsule daily increase week one capsule take three capsule per day . For treatment group would 75 mg ephedrine 600 mg caffeine per day . At 8 week surgery return office visit , vital sign take , BC do , symptom checklist complete review , experience significant side effect give 6 week supply capsule . At 14 week surgery office visit vital sign take , symptom checklist complete review give another 6 week supply capsule . At 20 week surgery office visit vital sign take , symptom checklist complete review , REE study obtain Good Samaritan hospital body composition bioimpedance clinic give another 6 week supply capsule . At 26 week surgery office visit vital sign take , symptom checklist complete review give another 6 week supply capsule . At 32 week surgery return office visit vital sign , symptom checklist REE study obtain Good Samaritan hospital body composition bioimpedance clinic . They give taper pack capsule accomplish 3 week . At clinic visit note vital sign , body weight obtain . Patients questioned side effect . They also encourage call visit persistent side effect , give symptom checklist compare phone . As usual routine medical surgical care provide visit . Adjustments medication blood pressure , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , nutritional deficiency forth address treated usual . Any surgical intervention wound problem , hernia , complication attend routine blood test diagnostic test need , do . If blood pressure control &lt; 140/80 , pulse &lt; 100 , patient experience excessive adrenergic side effect , treatment stop , patient continue usual follow medical surgical care . The investigator continue collect measurement patient unable tolerate treatment end study . Patients may withdraw , however , anytime without repercussion continue receive regular care . Body composition measure body impedance analysis Quantum III BIA RJL Systems ( Michigan ) . This high quality , reproducible system use electrode placement hand foot . While DEXA body scan may provide detailed information research cost measurement study would exceed cost medication alone . The investigator three RJL system clinic total body lean mass compare well comparable measurement obtain DEXA . REE measure use Sensor Medics indirect calorimeter O2 CO2 measurement calculate REE . This equipment locate manage Respiratory Therapy Department Good Samaritan Hospital calibrate , test use fund research study . The test do fasting , without morning medication minimal pretest activity ( 15 minute rest prior start test ) , normal fluid balance . The equipment calibrate test . Body weight obtain electronic scale , capacity 800 pound , shoe patient advise wear light weight clothes visit . The scale 's calibration check quarterly ( requirement current prior research study ) . The investigator use Welch-Allyn automatic cuff blood pressure pulse . Two measurement obtain arm visit . The investigator multiple size cuff match upper arm diameter . Calibration check quarterly research protocol require .
