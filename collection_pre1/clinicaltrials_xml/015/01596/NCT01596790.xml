	<brief_summary>Treatment metastatic colorectal cancer need chemotherapy case . During last year , many new chemotherapy target therapy develop improve significantly overall survival patient . However , choice therapeutic sequence become difficult due lack validate predictive biomarkers efficiency . Indeed , mutation k-ras oncogene predictive factor non-efficacy anti-EGFR antibody . It thus crucial identify new biomarkers propose best personalized 1rst line therapeutic sequence . One idea would enumerate characterize circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , describe recent study realize Cohen et al . patient metastatic colorectal cancer , would give u early evaluation therapeutic efficiency . In context , investigator develop innovative technology , EPISPOT assay ( patent University Medical Center Montpellier ) , allow detection &amp; characterization viable CTC peripheral blood . The EPISPOT technology already evaluate breast prostate cancer . Thus , investigator would like perform prospective study cohort patient metastatic colorectal cancer confirm , technology , predictive value CTC count efficacy treatment .</brief_summary>
