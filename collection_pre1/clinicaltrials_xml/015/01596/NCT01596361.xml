	<brief_summary>Interethnic variability chemotherapy response become increasingly evident , make approach customize chemotherapy treatment different ethnic population desirable . At time , significant genetic variation also observe ethnic group , include many germline somatic pharmacogenetic variant involve chemotherapy pharmacology . Recently , base meta-analyses study germline pharmacogenetic variant frequency clinical trial , investigator find chemotherapy outcome Asians Caucasians colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patient could potentially inferred frequency variant ethnic group respective biological function . In study , investigator seek clarify validity use pharmacogenetic variant customize chemotherapy ethnicity follow specific aim : ( 1 ) To verify difference observed frequency germline pharmacogenetic variant related chemotherapy Asian Caucasian CRC patient , ( 2 ) To test whether variation frequency somatic pharmacogenetic gene mutation Asian Caucasian CRC patient could use infer difference clinical outcome two ethnicity . ( 3 ) ( 4 ) For Aim 1 , DNA sample approximately 1000 Asian Caucasian CRC patient analyzed frequency panel germline pharmacogenetic variant identify meta-analyses use high-throughput methodology . For Aim 2 , meta-analyses perform pharmacogenetic study clinical trial establish relative frequency somatic variant clinical outcome Asian Caucasian CRC patient . These frequency verify series DNA sample use Aim 1 . The clinical outcome inferred frequency difference biological function compare summarized clinical trial . This data could provide basis develop rational approach customize chemotherapy non-Caucasian population improve assessment drug feasibility different ethnic populations.If validate , work hypothesis would high clinical interest , give opportunity use DNA prognosis biomarker CRC . Pharmacogenetic frequency could potentially useful approach predict likely chemotherapy outcomes non-Caucasian population</brief_summary>
