	<brief_summary>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) unparalleled efficacy treat severe depression , also useful treatment-refractory case schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . However , use limit significant adverse effect memory cognition . In addition , ECT precisely target , since relies unpredictable pathway electrical conduction brain . Magnetic seizure therapy ( MST ) currently investigation targetable , cognition-sparing alternative ECT . MST use magnetic field rather electrical stimulus seizure induction , dramatically reduce passage induce current undesired brain region . 10 year experimental study establish safety MST animal human subject . This pilot study investigate whether MST similar efficacy ECT , few cognitive side effect , patient severe depression , schizophrenia , OCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although ECT effective severe depression , psychosis , OCD , also produce significant impairment autobiographical memory cognitive function . These side effect limit acceptability tolerability ECT many patient population . They also limit number treatment administer course ECT , lead high relapse rate ECT discontinue . In animal study , MST show far few adverse cognitive effect ECT . In small human study , human show faster subjective objective recovery orientation MST ECT . However , precise degree cognitive spar MST versus ECT yet establish . Likewise , comparative efficacy MST versus ECT severe depression , schizophrenia , OCD remain see . The investigator aim determine whether MST spar autobiographical memory cognitive function , retain comparable efficacy ECT . Objective 1 : To compare efficacy MST ECT treat patient severe depression , schizophrenia , OCD . Hypothesis 1 : MST equivalent efficacy ECT objective measure mood , schizophrenia , OCD symptom . Objective 2 : To compare effect MST ECT autobiographical memory cognitive function patient severe depression , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder OCD . Hypothesis 2 : MST significantly low adverse effect objective measure autobiographical memory cognitive function patient severe depression , schizophrenia , OCD . Objective 3 : To compare change brain function result MST ECT . Hypothesis 3 : Both MST ECT produce change functional brain activity consistent antidepressant response , antipsychotic response , antiobsessive response , along spar cognitive function . The discovery viable alternative ECT , equivalent efficacy few side effect , would transformative effect treatment several form severe mental illness . At present , many patient could benefit ECT pursue treatment due concern cognitive side effect , well endure social stigma ECT . In addition , many patient benefit ECT oblige discontinue effective treatment mount cognitive side effect ; high rate relapse ensue . If MST could show spare autobiographical memory form cognition , many patient would willing take advantage treatment . They would also able continue treatment , effective , long period . The potential result would dramatic improvement rate remission relapse patient severe depression form mental illness .</detailed_description>
