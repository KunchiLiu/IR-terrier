	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve brentuximab vedotin treatment GVHD . Currently , corticosteroid standard/first line treatment people GVHD . However , patient achieve good response steroid experience flare-ups tapering steroid treatment . Corticosteroid treatment also lead weaken immune system . For reason , increase attempt researcher find option treatment Graft v . Host Disease . Brentuximab vedotin drug FDA approve treatment certain type cancer , like Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Recent research study find increased level protein call CD30 people acute GVHD . Brentuximab vedotin design target CD30 . Researchers never try target CD30 molecule treatment GVHD , result research study show could help slow growth disease . In research study , try determine safe dose brentuximab vedotin give patient GVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study break two part : induction maintenance . The induction phase last 28 day maintenance phase last 12 week . Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant Graft v . Host Disease , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . The induction phase trial involve find safe dose brentuximab vedotin . In phase , participant receive 3 weekly dos day 1 , 8 15 cycle . Brentuximab vedotin administer via intravenous infusion , mean directly vein , period 30 minute . Additionally undergo follow test procedure come clinic receive brentuximab vedotin : physical exam , medical history , performance status , routine research blood test , assessment side effect acute/chronic GVHD . If still study end induction phase , mean serious side effect GVHD progress , ou wil continue next phase study . Participants maintenance phase receive total 4 dos brentuximab vedotin every 3 week total 12 week . Day 1 maintenance phase day 28 day induction phase end . You receive dose brentuximab vedotin via IV infusion Day 1 Weeks 1,4 , 7 10 . During visit undergo test , procedure assessment induction phase . You three follow visit last dose brentuximab vedotin 6 month , 9 month 12 month end maintenance phase . You also option talk physician continue treatment brentuximab vedotin . However , brentuximab vedotin provide study 12 week maintenance period . Afterward , brentuximab vedotin need cover insurance pay pocket .</detailed_description>
