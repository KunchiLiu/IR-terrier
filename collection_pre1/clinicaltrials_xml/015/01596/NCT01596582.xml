	<brief_summary>Shared decision-making ( SDM ) advocate strategy increase colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen rate . Our study date suggest use novel computer-based decision aid facilitate several component SDM patient provider perspective , reluctance among provider acquiesce patient preference particular screen strategy differs . The overall objective study ass whether risk stratification advance colorectal neoplasia influence clinical decision-making related screen test selection adherence within SDM framework . Eligible subject randomize either experimental arm , ask complete 6-item risk assessment questionnaire know `` Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia Index [ ACNI ] '' review web-based decision aid , control arm , review decision aid . Both intervention take place prearrange office visit provider . The primary outcome screen test order ; secondary outcome include test completion rate , concordance test preference test order , , patient satisfaction decision-making process , screen intention , 6-month test completion rate provider satisfaction . Outcomes evaluate use computerized track system validated instrument .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Stratification Promote Effective Shared Decision-Making Colorectal Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second leading cause cancer-related death United States . Screening least 6 different method cost-effective yet underutilized strategy reduce CRC incidence mortality . Because method differ respect risk benefit exist evidence fails identify single best strategy , authoritative group advocate share decision-making ( SDM ) approach select appropriate screening strategy . SDM sequential , interactive process involve information exchange , value clarification , decision-making mutual agreement . To facilitate process , patient-oriented decision aid develop enable patient identify prefer strategy base personal value empower participate decision-making process . Our recent study date find although decision aid enable patient make informed choice , provider often unwilling acquiesce patient preference differ . Since accurate risk assessment critical component effective clinical decision-making , investigator postulate risk stratification point prevalence advance colorectal neoplasia enable provider incorporate objective risk-based criterion decision-making consider patient preference screen . To end , investigator recently develop validated so-called `` Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia Index [ ACNI ] '' stratify patient low versus intermediate/high risk category base available clinical data , include age , sex , race/ethnicity , smoke history , daily alcohol intake use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug . The overall objective study determine whether risk stratification use ACNI influence clinical decision-making related screen test selection adherence screen within SDM framework . Hypothesis : Providers incorporate risk estimate ACN decision-making recommend screening test likely consider patient preference option colonoscopy provider lack information .</detailed_description>
