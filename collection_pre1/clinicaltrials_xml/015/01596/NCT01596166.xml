	<brief_summary>Migraine headache common problem child . When treatment home fails , child may benefit intravenous treatment administer hospital setting like Emergency Department . Most treatment use however test adult best treatment strategy child always clear . The combination one medication frequently prescribe Canadian Emergency Departments . The purpose study investigate whether combination ketorolac ( anti-inflammatory pain medication ) metoclopramide ( anti-nauseant may also relieve migraine headache ) good metoclopramide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Migraine headache painful condition recurrent moderate severe head pain associate nausea , vomit , photophobia , phonophobia . The condition highly prevalent significant community health problem considerable impact health care system . To alleviate pain morbidity associate migraine attack , drug therapy often employ include simple analgesic like ibuprofen migraine-specific medication like sumatriptan . When treatment fail severe , intractable case , patient family may present Emergency Department ( ED ) . Ketorolac combination metoclopramide prochlorperazine common multi-drug combination use 36 % ED presentation migraine across Canada national practice variation study . The scientific rationale combine non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) inhibition cyclooxygenase ( COX ) 1 2 isoenzymes migraine therapy entice ; however , study specifically examine relative efficacy practice . Why would combination non-selective NSAID like ketorolac migraine therapy improve treatment outcome ? The benefit multi-target combination may relate duration migraine multiple brain area involve sustain pain . It long recognize patient treat migraine headache early onset good response . The underlie mechanism phenomenon identify . The initiation migraine pain require activation trigeminal ( 5th cranial nerve ) nociceptive ( pain ) system . Activation sensory fiber within arachnoid membrane surface brain produce first common painful manifestation migraine - pulsatile headache . With heartbeat , minor dilation cerebral blood vessel produce stretch painful activation trigeminal fiber know peripheral sensitization . The second phase maintenance migraine attack several hour sensitization trigeminal pain pathway lead high brain center know central sensitization . The efficacy medication like triptans great early course migraine attack peripheral sensitization onset central sensitization . Non-selective NSAIDs like naproxen sodium ketorolac may uniquely effective reduction central sensitization animal model migraine reduction migraine pain adult patient late course migraine headache . The population patient ED uniquely different outpatient develop migraine headache hour day present . In practice variation study , mean duration migraine prior present ED 2 day . Including NSAID treat prolonged migraine ED may thus increase therapeutic window improve outcome . While many Canadian ED physician adopt practice combine ketorolac migraine therapy , gold standard assessment efficacy safety randomize clinical trial apply .</detailed_description>
