	<detailed_description>Cardiac Rehabilitation central full recovery myocardial infarction cardiac stenting procedure . Yet , therapy underutilized across nation . Henry Ford currently enroll 42 % eligible patient . In addition , currently take , average , 42 +/-26 day hospital discharge enrollment rehabilitation . During delay , strong tendency return prior habit ( sedentary lifestyle , smoking , poor nutrition , etc . ) lead myocardial infarction first place . This delay 1 ) unnecessary 2 ) probably harmful patient ' readiness make change . The investigator seek perform randomize control trial early ( 7-10 day ) vs standard referral ( 5-6 week ) cardiac rehabilitation . In addition , investigator examine patient ' readiness change first 3 month post-hospitalization period correlate behavior enrollment cardiac rehabilitation . Assessment readiness change accomplish serial survey 's , administer discharge , 2 week , 5 week , 13 week discharge . Patients consent take survey observe clinical study . However , order avoid Hawthorne Effect , patient initially aware primary hypothesis , investigator strongly believe affect main behavior try measure . Full patient disclosure occur end trial .</detailed_description>
