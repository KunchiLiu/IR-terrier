	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety effectiveness rituximab give spinal tap patient lymphoid malignancy involve central nervous system . A spinal tap ( also call lumbar puncture ) fluid surround spinal cord collect insert needle low back . The affected area numb local anesthetic procedure . It also use give chemotherapy study . Rituximab design bind protein , call CD20 , surface leukemia cell . This may cause leukemia cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible , assign study group base join study . Up 12 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 13 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose rituximab receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level rituximab . Each new group receive high dose rituximab group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose rituximab find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive rituximab high dose tolerate Phase I portion . Study Visits : Once enrol , return clinic receive study drug spinal tap 2 time week . You receive treatment twice week 2 CSF sample row show leukemia cell . After , receive treatment 1 time week additional 4 week , receive treatment every week additional 8 week . The number dose receive depend many dos study doctor think need . At study visit follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight , vital sign . Â°Your vital sign measure every 15 minute 1 hour dose rituximab . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - You ask drug may take side effect may experience . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - A sample cerebral spinal fluid may collect lumbar puncture verify absence presence blast cell . Follow-Up : About 30 day last dose study drug contact study staff telephone ask drug may take side effect may experience . This call take 10 minute . Long-term Follow-up : Every 6 12 month may contact study staff telephone ask drug may take side effect may experience . This call take 10 minute . You may give drug help prevent side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Length Treatment : The number treatment receive depend long take leukemia cell CSF sample . Once happen , treatment additional 12 week . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment relapse and/or refractory lymphoid malignancy involve central nervous system . Receiving rituximab spinal tap consider investigational . Up 25 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
