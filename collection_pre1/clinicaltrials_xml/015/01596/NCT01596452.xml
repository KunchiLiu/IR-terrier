	<brief_summary>Modern anti-cancer treatment focus development molecular base therapy i.e . specific treatment target underlying biological process . There still much learn biology cancer , especially tumours colorectal lung cancer likely multiple heterogenous signal pathway responsible progression disease . This project aim evaluate circulate tumour cell ( CTCs ) surrogate biomarker tumour characteristic determine may use identify new target therapeutic agent . Their use could apply diagnosis cancer , prediction response therapy prognosis , ultimately across broad range tumour type . Currently way investigate molecular feature cancer procurement invasive tumour biopsy often difficult obtain , often result insufficient material unpleasant patient . A blood-based test would provide much practical patient friendly alternative . The enumeration molecular characterisation CTCs novel potential `` virtual biopsy '' tumour offer opportunity immediate therapeutic decision ( eg . tumour develops therapy resistant genotype treatment ) . CTCs known circulate bloodstream cancer patient many year know lead cancer metastasis . They difficult detect , recently , due complexity metastatic process detect relatively small number CTCs amongst billion red white blood cell . However , technology move dramatically last year . The FDA approve CellSearch platform ( Veridex , NJ ) isolate enumerate CTCs base immunomagnetic capture EpCAM ( epithelial cell adhesion molecule ) positive cell . Several study recently demonstrate value CTC enumeration reflect prognosis predict early response systemic chemotherapy . For example , study comprise 456 patient metastatic colorectal cancer start new line therapy , patient =3 CTCs per 7.5 ml blood baseline short progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) compare patient &lt; 3CTCs baseline ( PFS 4.5 versus 7.9 month P=0.0001 ; OS 8.5 versus 19.1 month P=0.0000 respectively ) . Overall survival patient convert maintain CTCs =3 within week commence systemic therapy remain bad patient maintain CTC count &lt; 3 per 7.5ml blood . Similar result report patient breast hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) . These study lead FDA approval CellSearch system adjunct monitoring patient 3 tumour type . The CellSearch platform , however , allow downstream DNA analysis capture cell ferroparticle-coated CTCs non-viable . Furthermore , platform multi-machine , multi-kit system laborious ( typical 3-7 day turnover time ) , expensive ( USD 650 ) , subject operator variance . In protocol , investigator propose first time , automate , fully quantitative system isolation enrichment CTCs . The key differentiating feature novel CMOS system electrochemical identification count tumour cell use high density electrode array associate electronics address electrode . This lead standardized assay tumour cell shorter turnover time without need skilled operator . This system also hold potential allow molecular characterization CTCs . This study aim enumerate CTCs use novel CMOS technology patient metastatic cancer schedule receive palliative chemotherapy , correlate CTC number clinical outcome . In Part I study , investigator recruit 10 patient metastatic NSCLC 10 patient metastatic CRC order ass feasibility CTC enumeration patient . In particular , investigator aim establish whether CTCs detectable use novel CMOS technology patient metastatic cancer . In Part II study , investigator recruit 21 patient metastatic NSCLC 89 patient metastatic CRC order compare CTC count determined CMOS technology CTC count determine CellSearch platform . Blood sample collect single time point prior start palliative chemotherapy . CTC number correlate clinical outcome evaluable patient . The investigator hypothesize CTC enumeration novel CMOS technology non-inferior CTC enumeration CellSearch platform patient advance solid malignancy .</brief_summary>
