	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open-label , phase I study assess effect dovitinib ( TKI258 ) pharmacokinetics cocktail caffeine , diclofenac , omeprazole midazolam patient advance solid tumor , exclude breast cancer . The aim study evaluate potential effect dovitinib ( TKI258 ) metabolism probe drug caffeine , diclofenac , omeprazole midazolam , metabolize CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 CYP3A4 respectively ( Cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ) , compare single-dose pharmacokinetics ( AUCtlast , AUCinf Cmax parameter ) individual probe drug co-administered without multiple dose dovitinib ( TKI258 ) 500 mg 5 day / 2 day dose schedule . The study foresee two treatment phase : DDI ( drug-drug interaction ) follow post-DDI . During DDI phase patient receive treatment probe drug cocktail dovitinib ( TKI258 ) . During post-DDI phase patient may continue receive treatment dovitinib ( TKI258 ) disease progression ( assessed RECIST 1.1 ) , unacceptable toxicity , death discontinuation study treatment reason .</brief_summary>
