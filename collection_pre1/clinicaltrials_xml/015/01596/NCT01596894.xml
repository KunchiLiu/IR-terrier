	<brief_title>Azithromycin Based Therapy Induction Remission Active Pediatric Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Recent review guideline longer recommend antibiotic therapy induction remission Crohn 's disease ( CD ) due study show lack efficacy . Genetic microbiological finding demonstrate CD characterize defective innate immune response bacteria defective apoptosis T cell . Bacteria show reside , invade epithelial cell , present granuloma replicate inside macrophage phagolysosomes susceptible individual . A defect bacterial trigger luminal epithelial intracellular compartment , simultaneously try induce apoptosis , never explore . Azithromycin antibiotic excellent intracellular penetration , high luminal concentration , also effective biofilms describe CD . It potent activator apoptosis T cell . Preliminary data pediatric patient short duration disease show remission rate 60 % normalization CRP 50 % patient treat azithromycin metronidazole combination . The investigator hypothesize 2-month antibiotic course azithromycin combine metronidazole effective induce remission active pediatric Crohns disease ( CD ) . The investigator also hypothesize remission accompany normalization CRP high proportion patient active CD . The goal present study evaluate efficacy combination randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Methods : This single blind multicenter randomize control trial child mild moderate active CD ( PCDAI≥10 ≤40 ) elevate CRP , involve terminal ileum and/or colon , compare two arm 8 week therapy : Group 1 : Oral Azithromycin 7.5 mg/kg daily ( maximum 500mg ) 5 consecutive day week first 4 week 3 consecutive day week last 4 week +metronidazole 10mg/kg X2/day ( maximum 1000mg ) 8 week .Group 2 : Oral metronidazole 10mg/kg X2/day ( maximum 1000mg ) 8 week . Four visit take place enrolment , 4 , 8 , 12 week thereafter . In addition , telephone visit 48 hour commencement therapy . Patients evaluate PCDAI , Physicians Global Assessment ( PGA ) CRP visit . The primary endpoint response rate 8 week define drop PCDAI least 12.5 point ( remission ) . Secondary end point include : 1.Remission rate 8 week . 2 . Normalization CRP ( CRP ≤0.5 mg/dL ) , 3 . Fecal calprotectin 8 week 4 . Corticosteroid free remission 12 week . Importance anticipate outcome : The investigator believe high dose azithromycin associate high remission rate early disease . If azithromycin base therapy validate appropriate RCT , would strengthen premise bacteria could , possibly therapeutic target CD early disease . At practical level additional treatment involve corticosteroid suppress immune system would available induction remission . On translational level , underlie hypothesis lead treatment regimen , namely bacteria compartment apoptosis need target simultaneously , might ramifications disease treat . Theoretically , CD may chronic disease investigator simultaneously treat two trigger persistent inflammation ( bacterial trigger defective apoptosis ) , ongoing inflammation allow continuous bacterial penetration .</detailed_description>
