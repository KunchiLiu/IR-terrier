	<brief_summary>Recent study show people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) also diseases related vascular health high cholesterol , high blood pressure , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , others , may end disabled people MS n't disease . This lead grow interest role vascular disease MS since may provide another avenue MS treatment . Some also think vascular disease may even cause MS . The back eye , retina , well-suited study vascular disease blood vessel see even routine examination eye eye doctor . These specialist use see change retinal blood vessel due disease know affect eye glaucoma diabetes . Sophisticated technique examine retina allow visualization blood vessel , rate blood flow blood vessel well . These blood flow change think come change blood vessel look like , may able detect problem even early routine examination retina eye doctor . Retinal blood flow never carefully study MS . Given MS affect retina due late effect inflammation optic nerve , optic neuritis , investigator expect see altered blood flow retinal blood vessel people MS compare healthy control subject . If , investigator use retinal blood flow way measure therapies target vascular disease MS population determine therapy alter course disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background data include age , sex , medical history , neurologic history status gather prior study/OCT test visit . At single study/testing visit , subject blood pressure intraocular pressure check ( use numb drop last 15-20 minute ) , undergo vision test eye dilate standard dilate drop . They undergo optical coherence tomography test determine blood flow retinal blood vessel take measurement back eye include thickness nervous tissue element retina . OCT Procedure : The subject seat head position chin rest . They ask look target ( lighted spot ) beam light scan front part eye . The light infrared visible cause sensation . A cotton tip swab may use help hold eyelid open temporarily necessary .</detailed_description>
