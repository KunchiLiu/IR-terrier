	<brief_summary>Our objective test two educational intervention teach cardiac auscultation : self-directed learn use portable audio file versus single , massed multimedia lecture intervention similar current best practice , determine would effectively increase recognition common cardiac sound physician . The investigator hypothesize doctor learn time could better improve skill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Two Teaching Techniques Teach Cardiac Auscultation Physicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants All non-cardiologist physician eligible study respond recruitment advertising . Participants 83 non-cardiologist physician volunteer ( 57 practicing physician , 26 resident train ) one Academic Independent Medical Center Northeastern United States enrol January 11 , 2011 February 25 , 2011 . Participants randomize study investigator use table random number . All participant give MP3 player time enrollment compensation time , receive grade participation . Participants provide informed consent enrol study . Educational Interventions Following pretest , participant interventional arm study give MP3 player contain eight , 15-second heart sound file ( 7 pathologic heart sound file 1 normal heart sound file ) alternate nine leisure song . MP3 player could play file order `` shuffle '' file random order . Each heart sound file introduce narrated phrase `` Identify sound , '' , follow 10 beat heart sound recording , narrate identification heart sound . Participants ask use MP3 player order improve auscultation skill often could ask record activity listen , give training . Following pretest , participant control arm receive 1-hour multimedia lecture ( Power Point ) teach faculty member ( AGK ) , review pathophysiology , exacerbate relieve factor , well visual diagram heart sound . The normal seven pathologic heart sound played participant lecture total 2 minute high-quality home stereo speaker , expose learner 1280 beat 1-hour session . Abnormal sound taught group systolic , diastolic extra sound , first introduce name , unknowns use mixed practice three section . At end session , control group participant give MP3 player heart sound file honorarium . Both intervention control group tell would retested 12 week . Both give paper copy Power Point slide self-study , electronic access original slide . Both group ask discus study participant . Content audio file The audio file heart sound obtained actual patient validity evidence generate prior study . The pathologic sound include aortic stenosis , aortic insufficiency , mitral stenosis , mitral insufficiency , mitral valve prolapse , S3 , S4 , normal heart sound . These heart sound collectively represent important auscultatory finding accord previously publish national survey residency program director . Measurement All participant take 15-question pretest addition posttest 12 week use identical heart sound file use training . Tests consist 8-second clip heart sound file , 10 beat sound . Participants give 15 second question choose correct response extend match list include 9 choice , one represent among train material ( `` benign flow murmur '' ) . Each 7 pathologic heart sound represented twice , normal heart sound represent . The order question test randomly select . The speaker use lecture format also employ utilized testing . Study examiner test speaker sound quality test . All test independently hand-graded two grader , discrepancy handwrite score resolve consensus investigator . Grades share participant . Both group ask rate prior experience pathologic heart sound , include observation feedback receive , satisfaction teach modality confidence auscultatory skill pretest posttesting . Both group audit preference learning style VARKÂ© learning style assessment instrument Version 7.0 , time enrollment . Both group ask record method use study auscultation study period . Intervention group exposure heart sound determined electronic interrogation MP3 player 12 week . Play count record device review study investigator enter electronic spreadsheet . Data analysis Demographic comparison , Likert scale satisfaction pathologic heart sound exposure control intervention group perform via Chi-square test Student 's t-test appropriate . Internal consistency pretest perform use Cronbach 's alpha . Total study time record 60 minute control group , calculate total number record play multiply 15 second per play intervention group . Additional self-reported study method amount exposure record add control intervention study time calculation . The primary outcome difference test score pretest posttest compare use paired t-tests . Effect sizes arm compute use difference mean divide pooled standard deviation . Correlations exposure improvement pretest posttest intervention group calculate linear regression . Subgroup analysis intervention group participant use MP3 player week 4 12 ( define play count= 0 time interval ) perform approximate decay group , analyze pair t-test . The auditory learn preference VARK learning style inventory characterize dichotomously present absent . A two-factor ANOVA perform compare intervention control group presence auditory learn style primary outcome dependent variable determine relative effect learn style instructional method . Power calculation make observed difference control intervention arm variable primary objective .</detailed_description>
