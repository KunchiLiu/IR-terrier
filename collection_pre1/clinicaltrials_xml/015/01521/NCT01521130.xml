	<brief_summary>This project examine seizure , abnormal brain activity , affect language skill child Benign Childhood Epilepsy Centro-Temporal Spikes ( BECTS ) . BECTS common type childhood epilepsy , BECTS patient stop seizure late teenage year , many study show child language problem may lead academic social difficulty . Using standardized language testing , monitor brain activity , MRI brain imaging , project aim determine particular combination BECTS symptoms put child risk language problem whether treatment anti-epileptic medication may helpful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Benign Childhood Epilepsy Centro-Temporal Spikes ( BECTS ) , extremely common type childhood epilepsy , traditionally assume benign course , recent study show cognitive function , especially language , often impaired BECTS patient . However , clear whether ithe seizure , centrotemporal spike ( CTS ) , factor cause negative cognitive consequence may impact school performance social interaction . BECTS patient scatter seizure frequent CTS , may suffer undiagnosed cognitive language deficit . This suggest causal role CTS yet investigate detail . This project examine impact seizure CTS neurocognitive function BECTS patient , diagnosis one year . We gather critical information regard effect anti-epileptic medication levetiracetam CTS , inform future Phase III clinical trial aim eliminate CTS improve long term outcome . This study explore interaction CTS , seizures neuropsychological outcome use Functional MRI language order decipher change neural circuitry underlie language deficit find child BECTS . Using standardized neuropsychological test fMRI time diagnosis , study first characterize nature incidence language problem child BECTS , separate effect CTS seizures . It expect child BECTS perform normative standard test language skill , accompany aberration neural circuitry support language processing test fMRI . These data also make possible characterize child BECTS risk language problem , take account contribute factor number seizure , age onset , frequency lateralization CTS . The proposed exploratory clinical trial also provide key information need properly design conduct future double blind Phase III randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) child aim improving language outcome elimination CTS . Using open-label dose-ranging design 1-year follow , determine best dose levetiracetam control seizures , eliminate CTS well tolerate . We also examine extent change language function neural circuitry language 1-year follow-up neuropsychological test fMRI LEV-treated untreated BECTS compare control ( document natural history neuropsychological function untreated BECTS child give additional information effect LEV ) . The current study provide crucial information future double blind RCT compare select dose levetiracetam carbamazepine ( current standard care ) BECTS . This would change clinical practice demonstrate need AED treatment BECTS eliminate CTS , turn improve long term language cognitive outcome .</detailed_description>
