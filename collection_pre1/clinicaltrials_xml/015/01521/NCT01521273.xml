	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency iron deficiency anemia among major health problem develop world . Women childbearing age well child vulnerable population group . In Rwanda , 40 % population estimate anemic . A promising approach combat iron deficiency Rwanda biofortification bean . The average consumption bean 150 g per person per day Rwanda bean major staple food . Traditional plant breeding increase iron content certain bean variety 5 11 mg/100g . Iron absorption bean however 2-3 % low high phytate high polyphenol content . A recently conduct study Rwanda show total amount iron absorb biofortified high iron bean similar amount iron absorb control bean , 50 % low iron concentration . This surprising since subject low iron status therefore expect maximize iron absorption . However , conclude additional iron breed bean bioavailable likely due strong inhibitory nature phytate high iron bean . To clarify , multiple meal study ( iron absorption study ) collaboration Human Nutrition Laboratory ETH Zurich Medical Faculty National University Rwanda plan . Subjects receive two different bean variety ( normal iron vs. high iron ) combination food ingredient typical region . The bean variety serve native phytate concentration , partially dephytinized ( 50 % ) totally dephytinized . Subjects apparently healthy female reproductive age ( 18-30y ) . Iron absorption determine stable isotope technique .</brief_summary>
