	<detailed_description>Introduction The purpose observational registry evaluate long-term effectiveness , safety performance market-released Medtronic Neuromodulation product Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) treatment refractory epilepsy . In addition , healthcare resource use patient report outcomes , health relate quality life assess . Enrollment Duration Patients meet eligibility criterion implantation Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy Epilepsy include registry . Approximately 200 patient meet eligibility criterion prospectively enrol expected two-year period . Approximately 30 center , mainly across Europe participate . Center selection could also extend site outside Europe . Each patient perform follow-up visit accord clinical practice . The estimated duration registry approximately 49 month ( 24 month enrollment phase , 24 month follow-up visit 1 month final data collection ) . Inclusion exclusion criterion Inclusion criterion - Fulfilling criterion label indication Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy Epilepsy . - Patient diagnosis refractory epilepsy define 1981 ILAE ( International League Against Epilepsy ) classification , implant implanted Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy Epilepsy . - For cohort , complete least two full consecutive month diary information seizure type frequency prior DBS implant ( seizure type classify least simple partial , complex partial , partial evolve secondarily generalize seizure , generalize ) . In regard prospective cohort , patient conditionally enrolled enrolment visit , criterion reassess baseline visit . - Patient patient 's legally authorize representative able understand provide write informed consent and/or authorization access use health information , require institution 's IRB/MEC local law regulation . Exclusion criteria - Incomplete and/or unreliable patient seizure diary base physician 's judgment - Patient currently enrol plan enroll concurrent drug , surgery and/or device study may confound result registry . Registry Procedures After physician determine patient meet eligibility criterion , physician enroll patient registry complete Patient Informed Consent Data Release Consent Form process . Once enrolled , patient follow least 24 month discontinuation registry . Follow-up visit occur accord clinical practice , approximately every 6 month first visit post-implant . Adverse event and/or device event report occur . Data collection occur follow time point : - Enrollment Visit - Baseline Visit - Implant Visit - Follow-up Visits ( period minimum two year ) The following follow-up visit schedule accord clinical practice , approximately every 6 month least two year till closure registry . Primary Objective The primary efficacy objective evaluate change seizure rate baseline 2 year follow DBS implant . Secondary Objectives - To characterize demographic population undergo Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy Epilepsy , - To assess adverse event related device , implant procedure , and/or therapy . - To characterize seizure type severity . - To characterize co-treatments . - To assess change health-related quality life follow DBS mean QOLIE-31 ( Quality life epilepsy-31 ) SF-36 ( Short-form 36 ) . - To evaluate change depression score time Exploratory objectives - To assess use health care resource specifically associate epilepsy follow DBS . - To characterize DBS implant technique device/feature utilization . - To assess factor good predict response level DBS therapy . Sample Size Justification The purpose registry essentially observational exploratory ; hence sample size calculation perform . Safety objectives - To assess adverse event - To characterize incidence sudden unexpected death epilepsy ( SUDEP )</detailed_description>
