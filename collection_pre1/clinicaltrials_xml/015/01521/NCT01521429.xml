	<brief_summary>Approximately 85 % individual Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) type I , II , VI report weekly pain 50-60 % significant limitation activity daily live due MPS related musculoskeletal disease despite treatment enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) . Thus critical need identify additional therapy alleviate burden musculoskeletal disease order improve health quality life individual MPS . However , disease progression need quantify able determine efficacy new therapy . This study multi-institutional , 5-year , longitudinal study musculoskeletal disease MPS . The objective quantitatively describe progression skeletal disease identify biomarkers either predict disease severity could use therapeutic target individual MPS I , II , VI . A database standardized measurement musculoskeletal disease MPS allow field efficiently move forward therapeutic clinical trial patient MPS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Bone Disease Children With Mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS ) I , II , VI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although child MPS I , II , VI treat hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) and/or enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) living adulthood good cognitive development , quality life significantly impact skeletal abnormality ( i.e. , kyphosis , scoliosis , genu valgum ) , joint contracture , pain , severe short stature . Additional therapy ( e.g. , post-HCT supplemental ERT , anti-TNFα drug , stop codon suppression drug , gene therapy ) decrease burden skeletal disease improve growth need . However , prior therapeutic study , control data quantify progression skeletal disease individual MPS I , II VI treat ERT and/or HCT need , along biomarkers use early predictor response treatment . Osteoporosis describe animal model MPS . It unknown whether abnormality see animal model MPS extrapolate osteoporosis increase risk fracture child adult affect MPS . Preliminary data suggest child adolescents MPS I , II VI low bone mineral density ( BMD ) adjustment short stature abnormal bone geometry marker bone remodel cross-sectionally associate BMD . It unknown whether decreased BMD childhood result osteoporosis increase fracture risk adulthood . Determining risk osteoporosis MPS I , II VI become particularly important individual healthier mobile new improve treatment thus great opportunity fracture . Glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) deposition identify bone cartilage animal model MPS . GAG deposition cartilage specifically show induce inflammation ( e.g . increased tumor necrosis-alpha [ TNF- α ] level serum synovial fluid ) , chondrocyte apoptosis , hyperplasia synovial membrane . We find serum TNF-α elevate child adolescent MPS I , II VI associate bodily pain poor physical function . Our long-term goal identify test new therapy musculoskeletal disease MPS . The objective propose longitudinal observational study document progression skeletal disease identify biomarkers either predict disease severity could use therapeutic target individual MPS I , II , VI . The rationale project obtain baseline data future therapeutic clinical trial identify potential therapeutic target . Our central hypothesis skeletal disease progress time biomarkers inflammation , bone cartilage turnover , predict severity skeletal disease time . Therefore , study follow specific aim ( SA ) : SA1 : To characterize progression skeletal disease childhood young adulthood individual MPS I , II VI . Our hypothesis progressive decrease bone health population mature young adulthood due decrease mobility , chronic inflammation , intrinsic MPS relate bone disease . SA2 : To identify prognostic biomarkers inflammation , bone remodeling , cartilage turnover predict progression skeletal disease impair physical function MPS I , II VI . Our hypothesis biomarkers inflammation , bone remodeling , cartilage turnover , predictive change physical function , BMD , range motion , hip dysplasia , kyphoscoliosis , quality life , height 5 year . At completion study expect quantify progression skeletal disease MPS I , II VI treat ERT and/or HCT use future therapeutic clinical trial . In addition , obtain biomarkers skeletal disease progression could identify early treatment efficacy . Finally , gain insight mechanism persistent skeletal disease MPS provide potential therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
