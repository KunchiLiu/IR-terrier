	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients VPED serous component comprise great 50 % lesion area , naïve previously treat Lucentis® injection Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use VisudyneÒ . Must total lesion size &lt; 12 disc area lesion great linear dimension &lt; 6 mm , great 3 mm center fovea furthest point lesion perimeter . The distance center fovea near edge optic disc le 3 mm . ( This distance confirm Oraya software prior treatment. ) . Must provide informed consent , document writing , give copy sign informed consent form . Must willing able return schedule treatment followup examination 1year duration study . Must least 50 year age . Women must postmenopausal ≥ 1 year surgically sterilize , pregnancy screen must perform prior study reliable form contraception , approve investigator , must maintain study . Must best correct visual acuity 75 25 letter ( inclusive ) study eye least 20 letter fellow eye ( eyes meet study criterion , eye bad vision select study eye ) . Exclusion Criteria CNV due cause AMD , include ocular histoplasmosis syndrome , angioid streak , multifocal choroiditis , choroidal rupture , pathologic myopia ( spherical equivalent _8 diopter ) . A globe axial length &lt; 20 mm &gt; 26 mm . Evidence diabetes retinal finding consistent diabetic retinopathy retinopathy cause . Hypertension control antihypertensive medication . Prior concurrent therapy age relate macular degeneration include submacular surgery , subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation ( without photographic evidence ) , transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT ) . History radiation head region study eye . Previous posterior vitrectomy time , YAG capsulotomy cataract surgery within 3 month , surgery study eye within 6 month prior screen visit . Intravitreal device study eye . Concomitant disease study eye might interfere effect assessment study treatment , include uveitis , acute ocular periocular infection , retinal vasculopathies ( include retinal vein occlusion , etc . ) intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg uncontrollable medication . History rhegmatogenous retina detachment , optic neuritis intraocular tumor study eye . Inadequate pupillary dilation , significant medium opacity , condition study eye , include cataract , may interfere visual acuity evaluation posterior segment . Subjects likely need cataract surgery 1 year study period also enrol . Known serious allergy fluorescein dye use angiography . Subjects must subretinal hemorrhage Retinal Pigment Epithelium tear involve center foveal avascular zone . Known sensitivity allergy Lucentis , drug use study , topical anesthetic , cycloplegic mydriatic , lubricate eye gel . Contraindication sensitivity contact lens application ( i.e . corneal dystrophy recurrent corneal erosion ) . Currently receive chemotherapy , complete course within 90 day precede study enrollment , expect begin chemotherapy participate study . Current participation another drug device clinical trial . History use drug know retinal toxicity , include : chloroquine ( Aralen antimalarial ) , hydroxychloriquine ( Plaquenil antimalarial ) , phenothiazine ( Thorazine , Stelazine , Mellaril , Prolixin , Trilafon , etc. , tranquilize antipsychotic medication ) patient exhibit sign retinal toxicity . Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent . Any condition , judgment investigator would prevent subject grant consent complete study , dementia , mental illness ( include generalize anxiety disorder , claustrophobia , etc . ) , inability position device ( due musculoskeletal problem , etc. ) . History significant , uncontrolled disease include cardiovascular , nervous system , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , endocrine gastrointestinal , metabolic dysfunction , clinical find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use intravitreal ranibizumab might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication .</criteria>
