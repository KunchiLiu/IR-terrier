	<brief_summary>- Background : Atrial fibrillation frequently associate typical atrial flutter clinical practice . If radical treatment atrial flutter radiofrequency catheter achieve case without recurrence , prevent occurrence atrial fibrillation occur 70 % patient several year follow-up . However , latter arrhythmia associate significant morbidity mortality . The problem atrial fibrillation occurrence successful ablation typical atrial flutter remain physician primary concern monitoring patient . - Objectives : The purpose study demonstrate pulmonary vein isolation use balloon cryotherapy technology perform time flutter ablation , significantly reduce risk develop atrial fibrillation two year period follow procedure . - Selection Criteria : Patients refer ablation typical atrial flutter history least one documented episode atrial fibrillation ( atrial flutter remain predominant arrhythmia ) enrol study . - Study Methods : This prospective , multicenter , randomize , 2-arms study , compare rate atrial fibrillation occurrence two year period follow either ablation procedure typical atrial flutter ( Group 1 ) , combine procedure typical atrial flutter ablation pulmonary vein cryoballoon isolation ( Group 2 ) . The enrollment period 18 month . Randomization 1:1 balance block vary size . Patients regularly follow clinically long-term ECG recording . - Evaluation Criteria : The primary endpoint recurrence symptomatic asymptomatic atrial fibrillation , document ECG R-test , occur M3 M24 - Number patient : 170 patient enrol study - Number center : Four French three German center participate . - Perspective : The demonstration clinical benefit term atrial fibrillation risk reduction patient group pulmonary vein isolation , could lead modification atrial arrhythmia treatment indication .</brief_summary>
