	<brief_summary>A large number cardiac catheterization perform year , primarily diagnose heart disease . However , cardiac catheterization invasive procedure associate serious complication heart infarction , stroke , death . Therefore , need non-invasive procedure diagnose coronary heart disease . The purpose study , therefore , assess diagnostic accuracy non-invasive cardiac imaging modality detection heart disease patient present first time cardiologist chest pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) remain leading cause morbidity mortality Western civilize country . Early detection CAD allow optimal therapeutic management order decrease morbidity mortality . In Netherlands 80,000 invasive coronary angiography perform year . Invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) , particularly conjunction fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurement , consider gold standard diagnose evaluate severity CAD current era . FFR measurement ICA useful determine whether coronary stenosis functionally important . An FFR &lt; 0.80 consider abnormal , reflect hemodynamic significant coronary stenosis . ICA superior spatial temporal resolution compare non-invasive imaging technique . However , ICA invasive procedure associate low , though significant , complication rate include bleeding , coronary artery dissection , cerebral embolism , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction death . Moreover , ICA provide limited information presence atherosclerotic plaque associate luminal stenosis . Furthermore , conventional catheter angiography without advent FFR measurement , able provide information hemodynamic significance significant luminal stenosis ( ≥ 70 % ) , i.e . whether coronary artery stenosis lead myocardial perfusion abnormality . Therefore , need non-invasive image technique diagnose evaluate hemodynamic significance CAD . Non-invasive technique serve gatekeeper invasive coronary angiography order decrease number purely diagnostic invasive angiography associate morbidity mortality . The detection management cardiovascular disease increasingly utilize non-invasive cardiac imaging patient suspect known CAD . By accurately identify patient eligible coronary revascularization use non-invasive cardiac imaging , number unnecessary invasive diagnostic coronary angiography decrease . Study design Positron emission tomography : PET image acquire use Gemini Time-of-Flight ( TF ) 64 scanner ( Philips Healthcare , Best , The Netherlands ) . Quantitative myocardial perfusion rest hyperemia ml -1. min -1. g -1 myocardial tissue measure use oxygen-15-labelled water ( H215O ) . Pharmacological stress induce infusion adenosine intravenously rate 140 µg/kg/min . Two minute start adenosine vasodilation reach steady state H215O give intravenously bolus follow start 6-minutes emission scan . Directly PET sequence , low dose CT attenuation scan ( CTAC ) acquire infusion adenosine terminate . Technetium-99m sestamibi inject intravenously second CTAC scan . A stress SPECT-scan perform 45 minute stress PET scan . Single photon emission compute tomography : SPECT imaging perform accord standard clinical protocol myocardial perfusion imaging . All patient undergo SPECT-imaging ( Symbia T2 , Siemens , The Hague , The Netherlands ) hyperaemia induce infusion adenosine rate 140mcg/kg/min , use dose 400 megabecquerel ( MBq ) Technetium ( 99mTc ) tetrofosmin . Tetrofosmin administer adenosine induce stress time PET stress perfusion scan . Directly stress SPECT-sequence , low dose CT-attenuation scan ( CTAC ) perform . A SPECT- rest imaging scan perform 72 hour stress SPECT scan day catheterization . Computed tomography : Patients undergo coronary calcium score ( CTCAC ) CT coronary angiography scan 256-slice CT scanner ( Philips Brilliance iCT , Philips Healthcare , Best , Netherlands ) . Prospective ECG-gating ( Step &amp; Shoot Cardiac , Philips Healthcare , Best , The Netherlands ) 75 % R-R interval perform order minimize radiation burden . Invasive coronary angiography : ICA perform via transfemoral transradial approach accord standard procedure . Iodized contrast give intracoronary procedure evaluate coronary artery lumen . The operator interventional cardiologist blind finding obtain non-invasive image evaluate ICA image . ICA image perform biplane monoplane cardiovascular X-ray system ( Allura Xper FD 10/10 , Philips Healthcare , Best , The Netherlands ) least two orthogonal direction . After primary coronary angiography , FFR measure coronary artery , use 0.014-inch sensor tip guide wire . A stenosis FFR &lt; 0.80 consider hemodynamic significant stenosis . Clinical decision making base finding obtain ICA FFR measurement make interventional cardiologist .</detailed_description>
