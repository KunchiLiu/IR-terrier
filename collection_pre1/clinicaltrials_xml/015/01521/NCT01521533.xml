	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy NOX A12 alone combination background therapy bortezomib dexamethasone ( VD ) chemotherapy previously treat patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NOX-A12 Combination With Bortezomib Dexamethasone Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant plasma cell express high level CXCR4 chemokine receptor , cause cell migration adhesion stromal cell secrete CXCR4 ligand , CXCL12 ( SDF-1 ) . NOX A12 specific CXCL12 antagonist may improve chemotherapy disrupt CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction , thereby mobilize plasma cell protective tissue microenvironments blood . Furthermore , SDF-1 inhibition may alter activation status plasma cell , thereby trigger apoptosis sensitization plasma cell towards chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
