	<brief_summary>Regaining independent walk top priority individual recover stroke . Thus , physical rehabilitation post-stroke focus improve walk function endurance . However , amount walking complete individual stroke attend rehabilitation far required independent community ambulation . There increased interest accelerometer-based monitoring walk post-stroke . Walking monitoring could integrate within goal-setting process ambulation goal rehabilitation . The purpose study determine effect accelerometer-based feedback daily walk activity rehabilitation frequency duration walk post-stroke .</brief_summary>
