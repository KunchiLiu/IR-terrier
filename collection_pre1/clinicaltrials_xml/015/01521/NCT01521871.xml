	<brief_summary>By mean prospective , randomised trial investigator want examine skin closure live donor - subject laparoscopic , hand-assisted nephrectomy - tissue glue ( Cyanoacrylate ( Liquiband ) ) versus conventional , intracutaneous suture dressing ( 1 : 1 ; 30 + 30 donor ) . Study hypothesis : ( ) Latest generation tissue glue ( Cyanoacrylate ( Liquiband ) ) least good conventional suture regard wound healing/complications . ( ii ) Peroperatively , tissue glue faster conventional suture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Glue ( Cyanoacrylate ) Versus Conventional Suture Kidney Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet , principal investigator since 1998 involved develop minimally invasive technique live donor nephrectomy ( LDN ) . Since 2009 LDN 's performed laparoscopic , hand-assisted technique ; mean 'handport ' 3 laparoscopic port ( 5/12 mm ) . The investigator consider use tissue glue instead suture another small step towards less invasive surgery . Since 2000 many report , even Cochrane review use/safety tissue glue skin closure . However , randomise study perform late generation tissue glue ; Cyanoacrylate , critical mixture octyl- : butyl-acrylate . And Norway research field . On basis , investigator intend examine skin closure living donor , healthy/homogenous study population , subject laparoscopic , hand-assisted nephrectomy , prospective , randomised trial : Tissue glue ( Cyanoacrylate ( Liquiband ) ) versus conventional , intracutaneous suture dressing ( 1 : 1 ; 30 + 30 donor ) . Primarily , investigator examine wound healing/complications wound observation postop . day 2 + 4 + 'at departure ' , numerical scale secretion , gap , edema , rubor - well infection/bacteriology complications/ reinterventions . In addition , donor ' self-satisfaction wound handle register . Furthermore , investigator look time consumption surgery , price , stay hospital cosmesis judge 2-3 month postoperatively .</detailed_description>
