	<brief_summary>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) still incurable disease . However recent advance establish correlation quality response ( particular achievement negativity minimal residual disease ( MRD ) progression free overall survival . That MRD negative complete remission ( CR ) current goal CLL treatment . The association Rituximab fludarabine cyclophosphamide lead best response rate 52 72 % CR `` medically '' fit untreated CLL patient . MRD result set still preliminary around 50 % . However many situation ( unfit , elderly , relapse , haematological toxicity lead early interruption treatment… ) associate much low response rate would improve consolidation treatment . Monoclonal antibody treatment choice consolidation spar marrow target CLL cell . Alemtuzumab use purpose result confirm improvement CR MRD negative response alemtuzumab induced immunodeficiency lead unacceptable infectious complication . Rituximab monotherapy induces low response rate standard dose regimen . This least partially due shave CD20 , mechanism CD20 lose leukemic cell cell clear . Using low dos rituximab reduce shave allow CLL cell clearance mononuclear phagocytic system . Such low dos rituximab administer subcutaneously . The investigator propose subcutaneous low dose rituximab consolidation CLL patient respond induction achieve MRD negative CR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective ( ) clinical study Main objective : - To improve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative complete response ( CR ) rate consolidation use subcutaneous low dose rituximab Secondary objective : - Progression free survival , treatment free survival , overall survival , - MRD follow-up , - Safety - Medico-economic study - Quality life study - Immune function study ( ancillary study ) Main assessment criterion : MRD negative CR rate , establish peripheral blood 4colour flow cytometry accord international consensus CLL MRD study , end consolidation treatment . Experimental plan : Inclusion patient evaluation response induction treatment accord NCI-ICLLWG criterion MRD analysis ( 2 3 month induction completion ) : patient achieve MRD negative CR . Consolidation treatment subcutaneous rituximab give 20 mg/m²/d thrice weekly 12 week . Evaluation response 3 month completion consolidation treatment . Subjects number : 35 patient need accept hypothesis augmentation CR negative MRD &gt; =40 % , exclude hypothesis rate &lt; 20 % . This ensure u alpha risk 5 % 80 % power , take account non evaluable patient &lt; 5 % . Brief description ancillary study : Immune function study consolidation treatment rituximab</detailed_description>
