	<detailed_description>PTSD chronic , debilitate anxiety disorder associate disability , functional impairment , host co-morbid physical mental health condition .

Baseline ( week 0 ) , 12-week , 24-week assessment , addition 36-week assessment delay MYT treatment group , include diagnostic , neurocognitive , psychophysiological measure conduct research team member blind treatment condition . Primary Aim : The primary aim current pilot study establish safety acceptability Mindful Yoga Therapy adjunctive treatment PTSD among OEF/OIF Veterans . Specific Aim # 1 : To establish MYT treatment implement safely . Hypothesis # 1 : There significant difference number adverse event treatment group week 0 week 12 . Specific Aim # 2 : To establish MYT treatment veteran find helpful accessible . Hypothesis # 2 . At least 50 % participant complete MYT treatment report treatment helpful accessible report self-report measure treatment satisfaction , administer completion MYT treatment component study ( week 12 immediate MYT treatment group ; week 24 delayed MYT treatment group ) . Secondary Aim : To assess effect Mindful Yoga Therapy adjunctive treatment symptom PTSD OEF/OIF Veterans . Specific Aim # 3 : To examine efficacy MYT + TAU reduce frequency and/or intensity PTSD symptom . Hypothesis # 3 . While group expect show reduction symptom , compare participant Delayed MYT + TAU group , Veterans Immediate MYT + TAU group exhibit significantly great reduction frequency and/or intensity PTSD symptom assess Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) ( baseline 12-week change ) . We predict Immediate MYT+TAU differential impact three PTSD symptom cluster , great effect hyperarousal symptom . Specific Aim # 4 . To document durability MYT treatment effect Immediate MYT group . Hypothesis # 4 . PTSD symptom score significantly different 24-week assessment compare week 12 assessment immediate MYT treatment group , significantly different 36-week assessment compare 24-week assessment delay treatment group . Tertiary Aim : To assess change heart rate variability rest baseline period guide meditation period Veterans PTSD treatment Mindful Yoga Therapy . Specific Aim # 5 : To examine predictive value HRV outcomes Immediate MYT+TAU Delayed MYT + TAU . Hypothesis # 5 . Increases high frequency HRV ( HF-HRV ) rest baseline guide meditation pre-treatment assessment ( week 0 immediate MYT treatment group , week 12 delayed MYT treatment group ) associate great PTSD symptom reduction post-treatment ( week 12 immediate MYT treatment group ; week 24 delayed MYT treatment group ) .</detailed_description>
