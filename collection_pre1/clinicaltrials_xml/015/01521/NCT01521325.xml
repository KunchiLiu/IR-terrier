	<brief_title>A Single-Dose Pilot Study Radiolabeled Amatuximab ( MORAb-009 ) Mesothelin Over Expressing Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine biodistribution radiolabeled amatuximab tumor nontumor tissue subject mesothelin over-expressing cancer include mesothelioma , pancreatic , ovarian , non small cell lung cancer . This single-center , single-dose , open-label , pilot study amatuximab approximately 20 subject mesothelin express tumor . 111Indium-radiolabeled amatuximab ( 5 mCi ) administer . Serial SPECT imaging ( 3 specific time point 196 hour cold infusion ) perform determine binding tumor nontumor tissue . Subjects observe closely safety possible development anti-amatuximab antibody . Pharmacokinetics radiolabeled antibody determine imaging time .</detailed_description>
