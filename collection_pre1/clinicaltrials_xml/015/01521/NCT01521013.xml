	<brief_summary>When patient present chronic disease depression , family physician agree treatment follow-up complicate patient ' health suffers result . Programs help depressed patient learn skill help manage mood develop ( depression self-care ) , use workbooks audio-visual material . The program show promise , little know self-care program may work patient depression chronic disease . Researchers propose study evaluate depression self-care programme patient age 40 least mild depressive symptom well chronic physical illness treat primarily family physician . All study participant ( 250 patient select different family medicine clinic Montreal ) receive package depression self-care material include Antidepressant Skills Workbook , develop Canada , available French English , use several province depression self-management program ; video depression ; mood monitoring tool ; information booklet give family member ; information additional resource ( book , internet material , local community group ) . The participant assign one two group randomly ( like coin toss ) : one group receive material , group receive material well regular telephone support 6 month train coach answer question participant may material work . All participant agree study interview three time : beginning study , 3 month finally 6 month . Patients ' depression score evaluate determine effectiveness self-care programme without support coach . Researchers also look effect self-care may use cost health service , whether engage self-care impact health behaviour ( like exercise , take medication correctly smoke alcohol consumption ) . All study data anonymous ; information could potentially allow identification participant remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Self-care Intervention Depression Primary Care Patients With Chronic Physical Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contact principal investigator references/citations . 1 . PRINCIPAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES We propose conduct RCT measure effectiveness telephone-based support self-care intervention depression comparison unsupported self-care intervention among community-dwelling person age 40 depression ( diagnose symptom ) comorbid chronic physical illness primary care setting . We propose conduct pragmatic trial relevant health policy . In keep , endeavor make method recruitment intervention delivery similar would use `` real-life '' implementation . All outcome assess end intervention ( 6 month ) . Because effect intervention healthcare service utilization may see within time window , assess utilization cost 6 12 month . Primary research question : What effectiveness support versus unsupported intervention evaluate severity depressive symptom 6 month follow-up ? Secondary research question : 1 . What effect intervention follow ( 6 month unless otherwise specify ) : self-reported utilization health-related service ; utilization cost physician hospital service 12 month ; general health status ; depression diagnose treatment ; severity anxiety symptom ; activation self-efficacy ; health behavior ( exercise , social leisure-time activity , smoke alcohol consumption , medication adherence ) ; self-care tool use ; patient satisfaction intervention ? 2 . Are effect intervention primary depression outcome mediate follow : use self-care tool ; activation ; self-efficacy ; health behavior ? 3 . Does effectiveness intervention vary follow baseline variable : patient sociodemographics ( age , sex , level education , family income , language intervention ) ; physical health ( physical function , multimorbidity , chronic pain ) ; mental health ( severity depression , comorbid anxiety , alcohol abuse , mild cognitive impairment ) ; level activation ; level self-efficacy ; type primary care clinic ; FP involvement study ; family involvement chronic disease self-care ; date randomization , time elapse screen randomization . Descriptive research question : 1 . What patient perception support self-care family member ( ) friend ( ) provide tangible emotional support ? 2 . What family physician ( FP ) perception self-care intervention ( ) information provide patient ' depressive symptom ? 1.1 . HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED ? This trial propose intervention design applicable within Canadian healthcare , model Quebec urban area . The study use aspects participatory research model integrate knowledge translation , include input feedback national local stakeholder age mental health . An Advisory Committee form , member various stakeholder group : Canadian Coalition Seniors ' Mental Health , Action Mental Illness Quebec . Input seek individual group prior , , trial , goal optimize use result collaboratively-developed strategic action plan implementation result submission stakeholder national , provincial , regional level across Canada . 2 . TRIAL DESIGN The trial design adhere CONSORT criterion , CONSORT extension pragmatic trial , guideline behavioral trial . The trial single blind , individually randomize , pragmatic trial telephone-based support self-care intervention depression compare unsupported self-care intervention . Patients recruited range different Montreal-area primary care setting ( include family medicine group , CLSCs , solo small group practice ) . In keep pragmatic nature trial , screening/referral option flexible may include : 1 ) wait room screen method ; 2 ) provider referral . [ We conduct focus group September FPs participate pilot study discus screen method . ] Eligible subject invite face-to-face meeting research assistant study present patient invited sign consent form . The baseline interview follow inform consent , patient randomize one 2 treatment group . Follow-up interview conduct 3 6 month post-randomization . 2.2 PARTICIPANTS 2.2.1 Recruitment Clinics A purposive , convenience sample Montreal area family medicine clinic within practical travel distance St. Mary 's Research Centre create , aim representation follow common type practice : CLSC , family medicine group , group , solo practice . Clinic director / individual doctor approach determine interest participation . 2.2.2 Patient Inclusion Exclusion Criteria Described elsewhere record . 2.2.3 Patient Recruitment Patients recruit 4 step : 1 ) referral potentially eligible patient ; 2 ) screen interview ; 3 ) recruitment meeting ; 4 ) randomization . ( Contact principal investigator detail ) . 2.3 PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS Described elsewhere record . 2.4 RANDOMIZATION METHOD We randomize patient individually rather cluster ( e.g , FP ) . Based experience pilot study , expect minimum contamination among 2 intervention group , little interaction patient FPs regard intervention . Patients randomized experimental control intervention use randomization stratify clinic/FP method recruitment ( screen vs referral ) . Within stratum , randomization sequence create use random block size 2 4 allocation ratio 1:1 . SAS software version 9.3 used generate randomly assign patient one two group . Electronic telephone-based randomization method appropriate context face-to-face interview , often patient 's home . Therefore , plan randomization assignment provide seal , opaque envelope RA administers baseline interview follow patient 's write consent . The sealed envelope open completion interview , patient provide appropriate package material ( either person , seal courier delivery ) . If patient consent , interview never complete ( patient present meeting , never available phone interview ) , envelope use next patient within stratum . 2.5 PREVENTION OF BIAS It possible blind subject FPs study group assignment . However , patient assessment blind far possible : follow-up interviewer inform subject 's study group , contact either coach FPs . Interviewers also specifically request patient divulge information type intervention receive . 2.6 TREATMENT DURATION The support intervention deliver 6 month randomization . 2.7 FREQUENCY , DURATION AND METHOD OF FOLLOW-UP Participants follow 3 6 month enrolment use telephone interview . 2.8 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Described elsewhere record . 2.9 PATIENT MEASURES We collect patient data follow 5 occasion : 1 ) step 1 identification interested patient ; 2 ) step 2 telephone screen eligibility ; 3 ) baseline interview ; 4-5 ) 3- 6-month telephone follow-up interview . ( Contact principal investigator detail baseline , outcome process care measure ) . 2.9.1 Adherence coach intervention In supported self-care arm , patient compliance intervention protocol examine use data coach log 3 6-month summary . Coaches record contact attempt complete , duration complete contact , topic cover , patient progress self-care intervention , tool recommend problem arose . At 3 6 month randomization , coach summarize patient specific tool recommend coach date , tools patient use . We also measure coach adherence intervention protocol . Coach contact record qualitative analysis monitoring fidelity intervention . The coach trainer responsible monitoring integrity intervention rating 20 % random sample record session ( 2 session per patient ) , use scale develop study . A random sample 50 assessment select , include total five call follow type call : 1 ) 1st call , 2 ) 2nd call , 3 ) interim call , 4 ) penultimate , 5 ) last call . 2.10 QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION AND SAMPLE SIZE During 6 month follow-up interview , patient ask open-ended question like self-care program could improve . A sample 40 patient ' audio-recorded interview select transcribe analyzed help explain process factor may impact effectiveness intervention also help guide future research practice inform development framework outline process support positive self- care experience . Using principle segmentation , two group comprise patient satisfy intervention ( one group type intervention ) two group comprise patient satisfy intervention ( one group intervention type ) . At 6-month time point , participant invite designate family member friend involve management chronic physical illness and/or mood . If patient consent , collect person 's contact information . We mail identify family member invitation participate structure interview , 2 copy consent form , along pre-paid return envelope . One reminder mailing send 3 week first mail . A research assistant follow-up telephone schedule 1 hour telephone interview family member return consent form . We estimate ~30 patient provide family member 's contact information ~10 family member consent participate . As currently prepare next phase research program , structure interview allow researcher explore way family member friend could source support people use depression self-care tool . Consent form interview guide approve ethic committee . 2.11 SAMPLE SIZE FOR QUANTITATIVE DATA Our target sample size 100 2 arm . Assuming 20 % attrition rate 6 month , recruit 125 patient arm , total sample size 250 . This sample size n=100 group 6 month , give u sufficient power ( &gt; 80 % ) detect , 5 % level significance ( 2-sided test ) , effect size least 0.4 primary outcome PHQ-9 , well continuous scale outcome . Cohen considers effect size small medium . For binary secondary outcome ( e.g . major depression diagnose 6 month ) , `` bad case scenario '' ( i.e . one two proportion equal 50 % ) , sample size 100 patient group 60 % power detect difference 15 % two proportion 5 % level significance . The power increase two proportion assume low 50 % . Based pilot study , proportion likely vary 10 % 30 % . For example pilot study , proportion major depression 6 month 23 % , power detect difference 15 % 66 % . The proportion heavy use alcohol 6 month 13 % , power detect difference 15 % 77 % . The sample size calculation conservative stratification ( i.e . randomization within clinic method recruitment ( screen referral ) longitudinal aspect design ( repeat measurement baseline , 3 6 month ) take account . However , analysis stage aspects take account ; result , power detect difference higher compute . 2.12 PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE AND LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP The sample 250 recruited period 8 month , average 7-8 patient per week . We estimate maximum attrition rate 20 % primary outcome . In pilot study , attrition rate 6 month 55/63 ( 13 % ) . 2.13 PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES Handling miss data measure All validate score pro-rated , provide percentage miss item exceed 25 % . When 25 % item miss , score treated miss . The SF-12 score involve complex scoring , simple imputation algorithm apply case miss data . When percentage miss value categorical variable exceed 1 % , imputation modal value perform . For categorical variable percentage miss value exceed 1 % , 'missing ' define additional level variable . Primary research question : What effectiveness support versus unsupported intervention evaluate term severity depressive symptom 6 month follow-up ? After direct comparison two study group , investigate possible clinically relevant baseline imbalance prespecified important covariates . In event baseline imbalance , salient patient characteristic include covariates appropriate regression model . This consistent recommendation CONSORT guideline particular , see Altman . The primary outcome PHQ-9 ( depression severity 6 month ) continuous variable measure patient level , patient cluster within clinic FP . The comparison treatment control group base linear mixed model ; allow u model multi-level structure RCT treat clinic FP effect random effect ( random intercept ) . A descriptive analysis characteristic drop-outs ( 3 6 month ) perform investigate mechanism miss value , attempt ass miss random ( MAR ) hypothesis . Analysis primary outcome intention-to-treat ( ITT ) . However , strict ITT analysis may hard achieve : example , preliminary data suggest considerable proportion patient drop 6 month assessment ( 20 % group ) . Our primary method address miss data problem Inverse Probability Weighting ( IPW ) approach . To implement IWP , plan use available outcome information . Our choice IPW approach base several reason . Of important one situation IPW require few assumption . Indeed , IPW require model probability individual complete case ; contrast , MI require model distribution miss data give observed data . Two sensitivity analysis conduct : 1 ) Analysis available data ( complete information outcome variable 6 month ) 2 ) MI use available patient information ; result across 10 imputed data set combine . Note MI give unbiased result MAR hypothesis correct . Both IPW MI base predictive model study group patient characteristic predictor . We develop model use baseline patient variable . Note result report actual p-values test confidence interval 95 % effect size . Secondary research question 1 : What effect intervention follow outcome ( 6 month unless otherwise specify ) : self-reported utilization health-related service ; utilization cost physician hospital service 12 month ; general health status ; depression diagnose treatment ; severity anxiety symptom ; activation self-efficacy ; health behavior ( exercise , social leisure-time activity , smoke alcohol consumption , medication adherence ) ; self-care tool use ; patient satisfaction intervention ? We select 5 main secondary outcome . For analysis consider complete data main approach handle miss data . Baseline imbalance handle primary outcome , adjust list variable . For overall cost outcomes , work total cost period 12 month . To compare treatment control group , use regression model take account skew censored nature cost data ( generalize linear model , conditional density estimation , hurdle model , among others ) . All main secondary outcome ( continuous ) analyze way primary outcome ( linear mixed model ) . For remain secondary outcome adopt exploratory , flexible approach . For example , consider Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) outcomes search clinically interpretable dimension , define score use summary ( secondary ) outcome . Secondary research question 2 : Are effect intervention primary depression outcome mediate follow : use self-care tool ; activation ; self-efficacy ; health behavior ? Using approach develop Van der Weele colleague estimate extent overall effect primary outcome mediate change mediate variable interest . These method , base potential outcome ( counterfactual ) theory inverse probability weight marginal structural model , allow estimation mediate effect preserve structure randomization . Briefly , marginal structural model build outcome function mediator randomization . The controlled direct effect randomize intervention , i.e. , effect intervention hold mediator ( ) constant , easily estimable model , assumption so-called `` natural '' indirect effect , i.e. , effect mediate individual mediator , also estimate . Secondary research question 3 : Does effectiveness intervention vary follow baseline variable : patient sociodemographics ( age , sex , level education , family income , language intervention ) ; physical health ( physical function , multimorbidity , chronic pain ) ; mental health ( severity depression , comorbid anxiety , alcohol abuse , mild cognitive impairment ) ; level activation ; level self-efficacy ; type primary care clinic ; FP involvement study ; family involvement chronic disease self-care ; date randomization , time elapse screen randomization . In analysis consider complete data main approach handle miss data . Also , baseline imbalance handle primary outcome , adjust list variable . For pre-specified modifier variable , consider primary importance , perform subgroup analysis . The remain covariates introduce regression correspond interaction effect treatment test . For covariates significant ( p &lt; 0.1 ) interaction conduct stratified analysis . 2.14 PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSES No interim analysis outcomes conduct . Baseline characteristic experimental control group ( age , sex , PHQ-9 score , chronic disease ) monitor , order detect rectify possible important imbalance occur chance . 2.15 PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES The role 5 select modifier examine sub-group analysis : age , level education , depression diagnosis , cognitive impairment , perceive family support chronic disease self-care . [ Despite importance sex modifier , plan sub-group analysis sex small sample men enrol study . ] • Age We hypothesize support intervention equally effective unsupported intervention follow age group : 40-54 , 55-64 , 65+ . To knowledge , evidence date age per se modifies effectiveness self-care intervention . Age associate improvement PHQ-9 score pilot study . We hypothesize support intervention effective unsupported intervention among participant follow patient characteristic : - Depression diagnosis Prior research difference effectiveness depression self-care intervention suggest diagnosis major depression associate great effectiveness intervention . The metaanalysis Gellatly find RCTs patient pre-existing depression ( vs at-risk ) associate great effectiveness . Jerant study intervention enhance patient self-efficacy self-managing chronic illness , find individual depressive symptom likely experience self-efficacy gain . We analyze follow sub-groups : major depression , minor depression , neither . - Higher level education We hypothesize participant high education benefit intervention . People less education high rate discontinuation self-care intervention . A nurse-administered minimal psychological intervention depressive symptom among diabetic find intervention effective higher-educated person . We analyze follow education sub-groups : university , high school , less high school ) - Absence cognitive impairment People cognitive impairment may great difficulty understand self-care material . In pilot study , great cognitive impairment associate less improvement PHQ-9 outcome . We examine participant BOMC score 5-9 ( versus less 5 ) . - Greater perceive family support chronic disease self-care . We hypothesize participant receive frequent help family friends chronic disease self-care benefit intervention . Studies self-management chronic physical illness find positive relationship social support self-care , especially diabetes , dietary behavior . In pilot study , find patient ` use behavioral tool positively associate patient ' report support family/friends depression intervention , family/friend report assistance instrumental activity daily live . We propose examine 3 sub-groups defined mean frequency per week assistance 5 self-care activity ( healthy eating , exercise , medication , symptom monitoring , medical care ) : 1 ) never , 2 ) rarely- day , 3 ) many day - almost every day . Additional potential modifier analyze use exploratory technique , describe section 2.15 , secondary research question 3 : sex , family income , language intervention , physical function ( PCS ) , multimorbidity , chronic pain , severity depression symptom ( PHQ-9 score ) , comorbid anxiety , alcohol abuse , level activation ; level self-efficacy ; type primary care clinic ; FP involvement study ; date randomization , time elapse screen randomization . 2.16 PROPOSED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Contact principal investigator detail . 3 TRIAL MANAGEMENT Contact principal investigator detail . 3.1 ETHICAL ISSUES In accordance relevant guideline Tri-Council Policy Statement Plan d'action ministériel en éthique de la recherche et en intégrité scientifique , study protocol , consent procedure form submit institutional research ethic committee . Patient identifier remove enter database analysis . Staff trainees patient contact train identify potential risk study participant , include suicidality , severe depression cognitive impairment . Suicidality . Depressed patient may bring suicidal thought research interview ( include screen interview ) coach contact . Staff ( interviewer coach ) train follow-up case determine whether patient intent plan act thought . If patient express intent act suicidal thought , staff : 1 . Ask whether may inform FP subject 's feeling . If subject consent , FP office contact immediately . 2 . Ask whether subject would like speak study psychologist ( see 3.1 ) . If subject consent , subject 's contact information provide study psychologist follow-up within 24h . 3 . All subject provide telephone number emergency psychiatry nurse St. Mary 's Hospital provide number Suicide Action Montreal 's hotline . Subjects encourage use number . Subjects suicidal plan identify screen interview exclude study . Subjects suicidal plan follow-up withdrawn study . Severe depression . The follow protocol follow subject severe depressive symptom ( PHQ-9 score 20 ) enrollment study : 1. subject inform severe depressive symptom encourage see family doctor ; 2. subject consent , FP inform appointment arrange ; 3. subject provide telephone number St. Mary 's Hospital Emergency Psychiatry Nurse . Cognitive impairment . For subject cognitive impairment telephone screen interview , : Ask whether may inform FP subject 's possible memory problem . If subject consent , FP office notify .</detailed_description>
