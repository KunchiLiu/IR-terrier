	<brief_title>Cvac Maintenance Treatment Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Complete Remission Following First-line Chemotherapy Second-line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose nontoxic immunotherapeutic approach extend overall survival patient complete remission . Most patient ovarian cancer achieve complete clinical remission optimal debulking surgery first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . However , patient , despite high response rate first-line treatment , relapse undergo subsequent chemotherapy . Generally , progression-free interval treatment become short relapse , patient eventually die disease . For production Cvac , patient 's cell enrich use cell separation technique . The patient 's cell culture 5 day granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) AIM V® serum-free tissue culture medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) cultivate growth dendritic cell ( DC ) . The culture pulse overnight antigen ( mannosylated mucin 1 fusion protein [ M-FP ] ) arm DCs specific mucin 1 antigen . After harvest , M-FP-pulsed DCs formulate finished product ( Cvac ) 1 mL aliquot , dilute 5 % human serum albumin ( HSA ) 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) approximate concentration 60 × 10^6 viable DCs/mL . The vial cryopreserved stored vapor phase liquid nitrogen manufacturing facility . Different participant enrol 2 part study . Part A To eligible participation , patient diagnose stage III IV epithelial ovarian cancer , underwent optimal debulking surgery ( ≤ 1 cm residual disease ) , underwent platinum taxane chemotherapy , without bevacizumab , tumor overexpressed mucin 1 , well meet study inclusion exclusion criterion screen . Patients meet study inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 double-blinded fashion either Cvac ( active ) group placebo ( control ) group . After randomization , patient underwent mononuclear cell ( MNC ) collection production study agent begin first-line chemotherapy . After completion chemotherapy confirmation complete clinical radiological remission ( Baseline ) , patient enter treatment phase study . A total 76 patient recruit randomized center Europe , North America , Australia . Part B To eligible participation , patient first-line platinum-based chemotherapy complete response last least 6 month prior relapse achieve second remission follow standard platinum-based second-line chemotherapy without second bulk-reducing surgery , tumor over-expressed mucin 1 , well meet study inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients meet study inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 fashion either Cvac ( active ) group observational standard care ( control ) group . After randomization , patient randomize Cvac underwent MNC collection production study agent . After confirmation evidence disease Baseline visit , patient enter treatment phase study . A total 15 patient recruit randomized center Europe .</detailed_description>
