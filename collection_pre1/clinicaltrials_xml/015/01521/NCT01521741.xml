All patient present baseline ( pre-operative ) arm measurement offer opportunity participate trial . At point purpose trial explain . Any patient wish participate provide questionnaire complete return ( mail person ) study coordinator prior surgery . During follow-up visit , questionnaire collect prior perometer measurement analyze conjunction measurement take day . We utilize questionnaire evaluate symptom , functionality quality life ( QOL ) . The perometer well-validated instrument consider gold standard today quantify volume limb . It accurate within percent far accurate circumferential measurement use tape measure . It regular part standard care MGH breast cancer patient . Patients routinely measure diagnosis , surgery , chemotherapy , radiation , four six-month follow-up visit continue year , anytime patient report new symptom swell arm discomfort outside time frame .</detailed_description>
