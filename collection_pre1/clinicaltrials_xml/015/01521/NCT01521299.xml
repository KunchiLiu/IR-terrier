	<brief_summary>This open label Phase I study two part . Part Two SCH900776 combination hydroxyurea pursue time . Part One investigate monotherapy oral hydroxyurea . The primary objective determine whether tolerate dose ( TD ) hydroxyurea single agent increase percentage tumor cell S G2 phase cell cycle . For reason , patient Part One must tumor lesion accessible skin punch biopsy . Tumor biopsy obtain two separate occasion : prior hydroxyurea 16-18h start hydroxurea therapy day 1 . A baseline 12-lead ECG obtain study participant . Single-agent hydroxyurea administer day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle , ONE cycle . On day oral hydroxyurea start late afternoon administer every 4 hour total 6 dos . Venous ( 10 mL ) blood sample obtain time zero ( pretreatment ) , 30 min , 1h , 1.5 2 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 4h follow first oral dose hydroxyurea , pretreatment time follow sixth oral dose hydroxyurea ( i.e. , 20 , 20.5 , 21 , 21.5 , 22 , 22.5 , 23 , 23.5 24 h ) .</brief_summary>
