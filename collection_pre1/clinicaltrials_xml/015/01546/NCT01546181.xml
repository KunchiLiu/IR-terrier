	<brief_title>Retinal Imaging Adaptive Optics Healthy Eyes During Retinal General Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most case severe visual loss developed country due retinal disease affect specialized class neuron , photoreceptors . Currently available system retinal imaging human allow neuronal imaging cellular level , crucial understand , diagnose monitor retinal disease . In recent year , adaptive optic ( AO ) fundus image proven capability image individual photoreceptor cell human retina . This technology reach technical maturation . A prototypic AO system ( manufactured Imagine Eyes ) currently operation clinical setting ( Clinical Investigation Center 503 ) proven reliability monitor single photoreceptors time . Yet , clinical evaluation AO imaging still infancy , biomarkers issue AO image validate . The goal iPhot project thus optimize process AO imaging ( implementation novel technical solution image processing data analysis ) order obtain morphological , quantitative longitudinal information concern retinal microstructures human . For instance , aim detect early photoreceptor damage retinal dystrophy .</detailed_description>
