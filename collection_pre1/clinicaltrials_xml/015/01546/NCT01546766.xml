	<brief_summary>The basic objective project test modification exist technology monitoring response pupil light method detect regional loss function retina . The `` instrument '' consist commercially available set goggles monitor eye position pupils use infrared light small camera . The signal monitor camera collect computer record pupil respond light condition . Because diabetic develop damage initially certain part retina serious damage , ultimate goal research develop simple , noninvasive , rapid method widespread screen diabetic order identify may require medical attention and/or therapy diabetic retinopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist three part . The first part work limited number normal individual know diabetic retinopathy test variety light condition find appear optimal detect retinal damage . The second part study , test instrument condition normal subject series diabetic vary degree severity diabetic retinopathy . This part study intend determine sensitive specific detection method full range retinal damage observe diabetic . The third part study use instrument either test condition use diabetic modification base regional area retina damage condition , include ( limited ) sickle cell retinopathy , retinitis pigmentosa , vascular disease retina . The risk study minimal . All portion study require clinical assessment participant 's retinal health consistent standard care condition . For diabetic clinically evident retinal damage diabetes , receive regular dilate eye exam photographs document appearance retina . For severe diabetic change , special retinal photograph fluorescein angiography ( photographs take presence dye inject arm vein allow one study detail change blood vessel retina ) do accurately assess degree diabetic damage . The long-term objective application develop imaging device early detection , diagnosis quantification degree midperipheral retinal ischemia Diabetic Retinopathy ( DR ) . Earlier diagnosis DR could facilitate intervention stage may prevent lessen permanent damage ravage disease , turn , improve patient quality life reduce lifetime treatment cost . DR one debilitate potential outcome diabetes pose major threat quality life diabetic . Experts believe DR lead cause blindness industrialize world people age 25 74 year old . The American Academy Ophthalmology state DR lead cause blindness among work Americans currently affect nearly seven million people U.S . Early detection help treat DR salvage 90 percent vision loss , one-third diabetic population remain undiagnosed , translate approximately 5.7 million people U.S. Delay primary diagnosis diabetes allow diabetic complication progress significantly detection increase risk associated disease make treatment much complicate . Diabetes management guideline advocate initiation therapeutic intervention early prognosis disease . Estimates diabetic U.S. DR range 15 % high 40 % .</detailed_description>
