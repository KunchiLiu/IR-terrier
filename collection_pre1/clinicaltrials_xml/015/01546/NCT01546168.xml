	<brief_title>Deviating Esophagus Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation commonly perform strategy employ treatment atrial fibrillation . However ablation posterior wall leave atrium cause thermal injury esophagus . When significant thermal injury esophagus occur , two significant complication occur : 1 ) formation atrio-esophageal fistula , 2 ) gastrointestinal dysmotility . While former rate , important complication since fatal . The frequency latter complication less well appreciate , probably occur range 1:100 1:500 . Currently luminal esophageal temperature monitor commonly employ modality prevent injury . However , limitation use , atrio-esophageal fistula report even use esophageal temperature monitoring . Esophageal deviation use either TEE EGD probe describe literature , effectiveness practicality technique suboptimal , therefore precluded use routine clinical practice . Recently , demonstrate esophageal deviation indeed possible use off-the-shelf equipment ( soft thoracic tube endotracheal stylet ) patient undergo AF ablation . In randomized double-blind study , compare standard practice ( i.e. , use luminal esophageal temperature monitoring ) esophageal deviation AF ablation . We hypothesize strategy esophageal deviation result safer ablation strategy reduction incidence esophageal injury assess endoscopy .</detailed_description>
