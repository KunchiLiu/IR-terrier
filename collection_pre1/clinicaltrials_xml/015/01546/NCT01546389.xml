	<detailed_description>Study Phase Design Phase I experimental malaria challenge . The study enroll 30 healthy adult participant randomize one three cohort comprise six group 5 individual per group simultaneously receive PfSPZ Challenge via ID route . The goal determine optimal dose require achieve 100 % infectivity ( ID100 ) adult volunteer . The parameter 1 ) dose ( number sporozoite ) 2 ) number injection 3 ) aliquot volume study ; add previous data collect University Nijmegen . The follow single time point inoculation regimen ( a-f ) assess : Cohort 1 : Medium dose , medium aliquot volume : . 10,000 PfSPZ ID 2 divide dos 50 microliter aliquot volume b . 10,000 PfSPZ ID 8 divide dos 50 microliter aliquot volume Cohort 2 : Medium dose , low aliquot volume : c. 10,000 PfSPZ ID 2 divide dos 10 microliter aliquot volume d. 10,000 PfSPZ ID 8 divide dos 10 ml aliquot volume Cohort 3 : High dose , low aliquot volume : e. 50,000 PfSPZ ID 2 divide dos 10 ml aliquot volume f. 50,000 PfSPZ ID 8 divide dos 10 ml aliquot volume . Safety , tolerability efficacy inoculation regimen evaluate . All 30 volunteer evaluate part inpatient stay ( Days 8-18 post-injection ) diagnose treat Pf malaria infection chloroquine . Following review , assistance independent SMC , 2 regimen choose test DMID 11-0042 . The following criterion strategy employ order list : 1 . Regimen necessary achieve ID100 adult volunteer ; 2 . Regimen elicit Pf patency parasite density ( detect qRT-PCR ) closely approximate patency rate experience mosquito challenge ; 3 . Regimen require least number injection ; 4 . Regimen utilize few number PfSPZ ; 5 . Volume administration consider easy administer clinician . Chloroquine sub-study : Eighteen thirty participant ( 3 volunteer six group comprise 5-subjects/group ) assign participate CQ possibly desethylchloroquine blood urine study design assess drug kinetics CQ course four week standard CQ dose administration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male nonpregnant female age 18 45 year , inclusive . 2 . Women surgically sterile ( history bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral salpingooophorectomy , hysterectomy ) , postmenopausal ( 1 year without menses ) determine otherwise medical evaluation sterile must agree practice adequate contraception ( double barrier method ( condom plus foam spermicide , diaphragm plus foam spermicide ) , license intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , intravaginal intra/transdermal oral hormonal method initiate least 1 month prior inoculation challenge , document surgical sterilization via tubal ligation essure procedure hysterectomy , abstinence vasectomize partner ) . The contraceptive method remain unchanged throughout entire study period ( 56 day ) . Serologic pregnancy test conduct upon screen . Urine test do day malaria challenge , day first positive malaria smear conclusion active surveillance ( Day 56 ) . 3 . Is good health , determine vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , oral temperature ) , medical history , screen 12lead ECG physical examination . 4 . Has normal laboratory value ( Urinalysis ( assess blood , protein presence great trace dipstick ) , hemoglobin , WBC , platelet count , AST , ALT , bilirubin , glucose , creatinine ) prior challenge study . Any abnormal screening value screen test list Table 8 exclude participant study exception elevate fast glucose hematuria &gt; 1+ detected menses female . Elevated fast glucose may need repeat due recent carbohydrate consumption therefore true fast glucose . Subsequent repeat fast glucose test normal range acceptable participation . For female menstruate , urinalysis frequently test positive blood indicator poor health status increase risk . This repeat clinically warrant . 5 . Able understand comply plan study procedure include inpatient stay Day 818 malaria challenge . 6 . Provides informed consent prior study procedure , correctly answer &gt; 70 % post consent quiz available study visit . 7 . Willing avoid nonstudy relate blood donation 3 year While formal exclusion criterion , deltoid area arm assess mark , burn skin damage . If , Investigator 's opinion , assessment local reaction could impair , subject may exclude criterion 23 . 1 . Has know history malaria infection , longterm resident ( &gt; 5 year ) malariaendemic area , bear reside malariaendemic area , travel malariaendemic area within previous 6 month . 2 . Has positive urine pregnancy test prior malaria challenge ( female childbearing potential ) , lactate , intention become pregnant within 2 month enrollment study . 3 . Use antibiotic ( know potential antimalarial property ) antimalarial drug begin 28 day prior screen extend Day 56 study surveillance . 4 . Has evidence increase cardiovascular disease risk ( define &gt; 10 % , 5 year risk ) determine method Gaziano . Risk factor include sex , age ( year ) , systolic blood pressure ( mm Hg ) , smoke staus ( current vs. past never ) , BMI ( kg/mm2 ) , report diabetes status ( yes/no ) , current treatment raise blood pressure ( yes/no ) . 5 . Is immunosuppressed ( e.g. , poorlycontrolled diabetes mellitus , cirrhosis , renal insufficiency , active malignancy , connective tissue disease , organ transplant ) result underlie illness treatment . 6 . An abnormal ECG , define one show pathologic Q wave significant STT wave change ; leave ventricular hypertrophy ; nonsinus rhythm exclude isolated premature atrial contraction ; right leave bundle branch block ; advance ( secondary tertiary ) AV heart block . 7 . Has active neoplastic disease ( exclude nonmelanotic skin cancer ) neoplastic disease within past 5 year history hematologic malignancy . 8 . Is use intend continue use oral parenteral steroid , highdose inhaled steroid ( &gt; 800 micrograms/day beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent ) immunosuppressive cytotoxic drug ( exception include asthma oral inhale steroid intake mean exclusion study enrollment ) . 9 . Has know history human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis B surface antigen positivity , Hepatitis C infection . 10 . Has history alcohol drug abuse last 5 year . 11 . Has history receive blood product within 3 month prior enrollment study . 12 . Has history psoriasis porphyria , may exacerbate treatment chloroquine . 13 . Has acute chronic medical condition , opinion investigator , would render malaria challenge unsafe would interfere evaluation response ( include , limited : know liver disease , renal disease , neurological disorder , visual field defect , cardiac disorder , pulmonary disorder , auditory damage , diabetes mellitus , transplant recipient ) . 14 . Has history anaphylactic response mosquito bite know allergy chloroquine , 4aminoquinoline derivative , atovaquone/proguanil , ( Malarone® ) , ibuprofen , acetaminophen may use treat volunteer develop malaria P. falciparum challenge . 15 .
