	<brief_summary>Femoro-acetabular impingement ( FAI ) know cause hip pain possibly major cause adult hip osteoarthritis . The relationship cam-type FAI deformity characteristic joint degradation well identify 'at-risk ' patient require corrective surgery scrutinize gain well understanding condition 's natural history . The influence certain morphology ( e.g . size location deformity ) analyze determine lead aberrant load region cartilage subchondral bone , result cartilage damage joint degradation . Additionally , research determine change subchondral bone precede cartilage degeneration . The methodology establish morphology/cartilage degeneration relationship include Magnetic Resonance Image ( MRI ) analysis , three-dimensional motion analysis computer simulation/finite element analysis . The outcome research may lead reduction total hip replacement case much 70 % , save many Canadians painful debilitate condition reduce cost Canadian health care system much $ 290 million annually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hip Impingement - Understanding Cartilage Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research objectives : 1 . To determine factor cam deformity , include morphological , functional bone quality , associate cartilage degeneration shape analysis , kinematic analysis , MRI image bone densitometry . 2 . To determine whether subchondral bone change occur detectable cartilage degeneration examine magnetic resonance image asymptomatic subject identifiable deformity . 3 . To use 3D motion finite element analysis examine difference mechanical stimuli subchondral bone cartilage associate FAI , thus expand understand pathomechanisms associate degeneration . Three subject cohort recruit : subject bilateral cam deformity unilateral symptom ( Group I , 'active cartilage damage stage ' ) , asymptomatic subject cam deformity ( Group II , 'early stage ' ) asymptomatic control subject deformity ( Group III ) .</detailed_description>
