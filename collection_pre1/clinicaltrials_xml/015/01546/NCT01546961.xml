	<detailed_description>For treatment P.vivax standard treatment chloroquine . There grow body evidence suggest pregnant woman may require different dos drug , include antimalarial , due physiological change pregnancy . It important drug use pregnant woman give correct dose . The way evaluate pharmacokinetic study . We propose evaluate pharmacokinetics chloroquine use treat P.vivax 2nd 3rd trimester pregnancy . The evaluation woman post-partum require control . The two recent pharmacokinetic publication conclude differently chloroquine dose pregnant woman : one suggest dose adjustment high dose probably need . It crucial pregnant woman dose correctly maximise cure minimize chance recurrence harmful effect malaria . The propose study pharmacokinetics chloroquine treatment pregnant woman solve dilemma . Pregnant woman Thai-Burmese border encourage attend antenatal care often early detection treatment malaria . Low birth weight due P.vivax affect primigravida multigravida , primarily primigravida P.falciparum ( highlight attach reference ) . Hence important consider woman radical cure . This possible pregnancy primaquine contraindicate next best time post-partum period . During post-partum period woman remain close contact midwives infant care personal health . The midwife also record malaria attack pregnancy . We know chloroquine antimalarial use pregnancy . It widely use prevention treatment malaria pregnancy woman autoimmune disease systemic lupus rheumatoid arthritis high dos hydroxychloroquine give daily include first trimester pregnancy . Although data prospective clinical trial malaria limit , drug consider safe trimester pregnancy lactation . For treatment uncomplicated P.vivax WHO recommend chloroquine primaquine P.vivax remain chloroquine sensitive . A 14 day course primaquine recommend radical cure P.vivax . WHO advise use primaquine pregnancy severe G6PD . WHO permit use primaquine lactation breast feed infant G6PD deficient . The possibility woman recurrent P.vivax pregnancy may chloroquine resistant P.vivax need consider . While combination chloroquine primaquine use pregnancy safety efficacy ACTs still undergo evaluation need explore alternative chloroquine case . ACTs recommend chloroquine resistant P.vivax WHO one ACT consider safe pregnancy lactation 7 day course artesunate-clindamycin .</detailed_description>
