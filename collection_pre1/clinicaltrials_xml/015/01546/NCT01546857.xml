	<brief_summary>This study do determine drug call gabapentin help postoperative management patient undergo hip knee operation . The investigator wish determine effect gabapentin pain sleep follow surgery . If lessen patient 's pain improve sleep , patient well able participate physical therapy . Gabapentin already show lessen postoperative pain give surgery . In healthy patient , also show improve certain aspect sleep . We hope identify effect drug , give surgery , patient ' pain sleep .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Gabapentin Orthopedic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study also support use gabapentin adjuvant medication postoperative pain management . Gabapentin decrease pain associate movement post-mastectomy patient . Gilron et al show combination gabapentin rofecoxib superior either medication alone relieve pain hysterectomy . Later , Gilron et al show add meloxicam gabapentin patient undergoing outpatient laparoscopic surgery provide little additional benefit . Clarke et al demonstrate decrease use opioids patient receive preoperative postoperative gabapentin total knee arthroplasty . They also note optimum timing dosage gabapentin need elucidate . However , year , Clarke et al also report gabapentin provide benefit total hip arthroplasty robust multimodal analgesic regimen combine spinal anesthesia . The side effect gabapentin include sleepiness , may benefit postoperative period . In meta-analysis , Peng show 35 % decrease total opioid consumption first 24 hour postoperatively . However , note increase sleepiness dizziness . While recent investigation find connection sleep disturbance postoperative pain , questionnaire study find common reason nighttime awakening pain , analgesia helpful intervention . Gabapentin , structural analogue y-aminobutyric acid , show healthy subject increase SWS ; maintain stable REM ; reduce arousal , awakening , stage shiftsâ€”all feature sleep fragmentation . Gabapentin currently use treat epilepsy , diabetic neuropathy , postherpetic neuralgia , well restless leg syndrome , effect sleep pattern may attribute therapeutic success disorder Sleep deviate normal sleep pattern postoperative patient . Total sleep time , proportion REM sleep , proportion slow wave sleep ( SWS ) reduce . Sleep postoperatively tend highly fragmented multiple spontaneous awakening movement arousal . Most change occur postoperative day 1 2 ; however , patient also incur REM sleep rebound day 3 4 extend week . Studies demonstrate postoperative sleep disturbance , notably prolong REM sleep rebound , may contribute development altered mental function , postoperative episodic hypoxemia , hemodynamic instability . A recent study even find postoperative sleep disruption independently predict functional limitation three month follow surgery patient underwent total knee replacement . The pathogenesis sleep change appear strongly correlate magnitude surgery oppose type anesthesia use . Many specific mediator surgical stress response indicate , include catecholamine , cortisol , IL-1 ; however , REM sleep control many region brain , disturbance may due global excitatory CNS effect . Our study recruit 90 patient age 18 70 undergoing total hip arthroplasty , hip fracture repair , total knee arthroplasty assign ASA rating I-III , pregnant . After Institutional Review Board approval , write informed consent obtain patient . The study protocol , use Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) pump , sleep scale , sedation scale , visual analogue scale pain explain . Demographic information obtain include age , gender , past medical history , past surgical history , hospitalization , current medication , allergy , history drug alcohol abuse . In addition , preoperative sleep history obtain use Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) [ 14 , 15 ] . The 50 patient randomize two group : ( 1 ) placebo , ( 2 ) gabapentin . An Excel generate randomization schedule employ . The dosage gabapentin administer 400mg . Prior surgery , patient administer midazolam 1-3mg IV achieve anxiolysis . They also receive lumbar plexus block femoral nerve block , depend surgery do , become standard care orthopedic patient University Hospital . All patient receive celecoxib 200 mg po bid three postoperative day . In operating room , standard general anesthesia technique utilized . Upon extubation , patient transfer postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , baseline pain sedation score obtain use Visual Acuity Scale ( VAS ) , Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) , Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) , respectively . All pain score assess subject rest position . A continuous infusion bupivacaine 0.125mg/L start rate 10mL/hr continue postoperative day 2 . An I.V . PCA hydromorphone pump initiate set deliver 0.2mg bolus per demand 5 minute lockout background infusion . All patient instruct maintain VAS pain score less 4 10 . If VAS pain score 5 great rest two consecutive pain assessment , dose intravenous PCA hydromorphone increase deliver 0.3mg bolus per demand . At approximately 9pm day procedure first dose placebo/gabapentin give . The gabapentin placebo treatment give 9 pm postoperative day 1 . The surgical team ask order additional medication sleep . The following morning , POD1 POD2 , questionnaire address quality sleep , hour sleep , number awakening throughout night , contribute reason awakening ( pain , noise , urination , temperature discomfort , positional discomfort , nurse care , reason ) give . Patients also assess pain , sedation , well incidence side effect , include nausea , vomit , dizziness , pruritus . In addition , patient begin as-tolerated weight-bearing rehabilitation program range motion , strengthen , balance ambulation begin first day surgery . Success completion physical therapy goal bed chair postop day 1 ambulate postop day 2 determine group . The purpose study determine single dose gabapentin decrease patient ' postoperative pain . The primary endpoint opioid consumption ; additional assessment include : subjective sleep scale , pain score , patient 's ability reach postoperative rehabilitation goal</detailed_description>
