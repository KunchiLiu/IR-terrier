	<brief_title>Dabigatran 's Effect Changes Atrial Fibrosis Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) one common cardiac arrhythmia medical practice clinical hospital setting . In addition three-fold increase risk mortality , AF patient increase risk develop stroke . This risk increase 6.7 % 50-59 year age 36.2 % 80-89 year age . One serious complication AF thromboembolism ( TE ) , include Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) stroke , fatal disable many patient associate either type AF - recurrent persistent . Image-based method risk-stratification clinical score system , CHADS2 score , potential advance understand mechanism govern AF recurrence well thrombus formation improve ability prevent potentially devastating complication . Treatments AF include antiarrhythmic drug therapy , anticoagulation , catheter ablation , cardioversion , thoroughly study . Anticoagulation undisputably effective prevent stroke patient AF , reduce incidence stroke 3 fold high-risk patient . Pradaxa® ( Dabigatran etexilate ) new oral anticoagulant approve FDA October 19 , 2010 reduce risk stroke systemic embolism patient non-valvular AF . Pradaxa direct reversible inhibitor thrombin , penultimate protease coagulation process . Thrombin convert fibrinogen fibrin , participate form matrix blood clot . Pradaxa® inhibit formation thrombus inhibit conversion fibrinogen fibrin . Prior approval Pradaxa® , warfarin oral anticoagulant available US reduce risk stroke associate AF , use limit number undesirable characteristic . Recently , RE-LY study show Pradaxa® 150mg bid statistically significantly superior warfarin reduce risk stroke patient AF , although statistically significant difference risk hemorrhage warfarin Pradaxa® . Pradaxa® use approve indication study . The link AF stroke complex remodeling leave atrium ( LA ) may play central role . Atrial remodel refers persistent change atrial structure function . Fibrosis , extensive deposition extracellular matrix component ( specifically collagen fibronectin ) , major causative component structural remodel LA . AF promote fibrosis structural remodel turn lead increase heterogeneity electrical conduction LA contribute AF progression . Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging ( LGE-MRI ) , noninvasive technique allow u detect quantify structural remodel LA tissue patient AF . Changes composition LA tissue detect LGE-MRI base delayed enhancement property gadolinium-based contrast agent , whose slow washout kinetics relative normal surround tissue , quantify increase fibrosis ( structural remodel myocardium prior ablation ) scar ( inflammation tissue remodel post ablation ) . Preliminary finding lab demonstrate significantly large amount atrial remodel / fibrosis detect use LGE-MRI patient stroke compare without . Thrombin ( protease inhibit Pradaxa® ) , also potent mitogen connective-tissue produce cell prone develop fibrosis chemoattractant fibroblast , thus play important role development tissue fibrosis . Bogatkevich et al . recently demonstrate Pradaxa restrain fibrotic event lung fibroblast , suggest thrombin inhibition could effective strategy inhibit fibrosis organ , include heart . We suggest characteristic fibrosis quantify leave atrium similar fibrosis see organ lung , skin kidney . We hypothesize Pradaxa inhibit leave atrial structural remodeling ( measure percent fibrosis ) associate AF . In study , plan study effect Pradaxa remodeling leave atrial structure ( measure percent fibrosis ) detect LGE-MRI .</detailed_description>
