	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study conduct head-to-head comparison two designs transhumeral level upper limb prosthetic socket : traditional socket design socket design hypothesize provide great skeletal stabilization . The investigator comparison include assessment patient comfort satisfaction fit , well dynamic kinematic assessment use X-Ray Reconstruction Moving Morphology ( XROMM ) novel high-speed , high-resolution , bi-plane video radiography system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past decade , advance upper limb socket design technology propose increase comfort decrease perceive weight prosthesis . There scientific study date evaluate benefit design , thus evidence support use one type prosthetic socket design another . Thus , overall purpose pilot study conduct head-to-head comparison two designs transhumeral level upper limb prosthetic socket : traditional socket design socket design hypothesize provide great skeletal stabilization .</detailed_description>
