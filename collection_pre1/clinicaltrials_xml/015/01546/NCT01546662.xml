Screening II ( Day -7 ) Visit : Laboratory result ECG report analyse investigator . Eligible subject enter 7 day run-in period . Rescue medication dispense . Baseline Visit/ Randomization Visit ( Week 0 ) : At end screen period ( Baseline visit , window period + 3 day ) , subject fulfil rhinitis frequency symptom criterion ( baseline average score : average 24-h TNSS 10 15 day , require 2 tablet rescue medication ( Loratidine ) daily control symptom ) randomize one 3 treatment group receive follow treatment regimen : 1 . Group 1 : E-RH-06/ 1 BID : ( E-RH-06 + Placebo ) Twice Daily 2 . Group 2 : E-RH-06/ 2 BID : ( E-RH-06 + E-RH-06 ) Twice Daily 3 . Group 3 : Placebo : ( Placebo + Placebo ) Twice Daily Rescue medication accountability &amp; dispensing performed . Specially design rescue medication chart dispense . Subjects provide subject diary . Vitals &amp; general examination perform . TNS score perform . IP/ Placebo dispense . IP accountability perform . Adverse event &amp; serious adverse event monitoring perform . Days 14 ( window period plus/ minus 3 day ) ( Follow Up I Visit ) : This visit involve general examination &amp; vital sign record . The frequency intensity symptom well AE/SAE monitor document . IP/ placebo accountability &amp; dispensing conduct . Rescue medication accountability &amp; dispense do . TNS score perform . Day 28 ( window period plus/ minus 3 day ) ( Follow Up II Visit ) : General examination , vital sign ( Blood Pressure Pulse ) recording , document frequency intensity symptom , monitor AE/SAE do .

Rescue medication dispense continue . Blood sample collect CBC , SGPT &amp; Serum Creatinine analysis . ECG perform . Day 112 ( window period plus/ minus 3 day ) ( Post Treatment Follow Up Visit ) : The visit involve general examination , vital sign record , document frequency intensity symptom , monitor AE/SAE use rescue medication . Rescue medication accountability perform . TNS score perform . In follow clinic visit , weekly score intensity rhinitis symptom obtain subject diary /telephonic assessment make week . Telephonic Follow Up : Telephonic follow do Day 42 , 78 &amp; 90 ass nasal symptom . Phase II ( Extended Follow-up ) : At end Day 112 , interim analysis conduct ass sustain efficacy investigational product accordingly study enter phase II . In case than/ equal 75 % subject individual active group demonstrate significant sustain efficacy week 16 , study enter open label , exploratory , extend follow-up phase next 36 week ( total 52 week ) . This extend follow-up phase conduct determine 12-week treatment E-RH-06 help reduce risk seasonal nasal congestion with-or-without rhinorrhea extend follow-up period 52-weeks . No efficacy safety evaluation carry phase ( extended follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
