	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure level serum proteins biomarkers cervical cancer patient . We believe marker may useful select patient specific type cancer therapy . These marker may also help predict response therapy , relapse therapy , survival therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS Specific Aim 1 : To use gene expression analysis primary cervical cancer identify gene expression signature predict lymph node metastasis disease . Specific Aim 2 : To predict lymph node metastasis perform multiplex measurement cancer-associated protein cytokine use proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) plasma sample . Specific Aim 3 : To measure circulate human papilloma virus ( HPV ) DNA plasma sample cervical cancer patient use real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) determine ability predict nodal metastasis . Specific Aim 4 : To use deep sequencing evaluate gene sequence difference cervical cancer patient without lymph node metastasis .</detailed_description>
