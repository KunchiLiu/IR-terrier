	<brief_summary>Water method water exchange show reduce medication requirement pain experience colonoscopy . It increase success rate cecal intubation sedate unsedated patient undergo screen colonoscopy . Exchange water scope insertion minimize distension colonic lumen decrease loop formation . Exclusion air colon insertion omission air insufflation suction removal residual air prevent elongation colon . These maneuver facilitate colonoscopy insertion average patient may enhance success difficult colonoscopy . Colonoscopy consider gold standard procedure screen colorectal disease . However , 5-10 % colonoscopy incomplete due patient discomfort , difficult anatomy prior abdominal pelvic surgery . The investigator postulate patient may benefit use water method colonoscopy . In proposal investigator test hypothesis compare conventional air insufflation water method water exchange significantly enhance success rate cecal intubation patient immediately fail colonoscopy . The aim study compare outcome colonoscopy use water method versus conventional air method patient incomplete colonoscopy . The primary outcome cecal intubation success rate . The secondary outcome include cecal intubation time , maximum pain score colonoscopy , overall pain score colonoscopy adenoma detection rate .</brief_summary>
