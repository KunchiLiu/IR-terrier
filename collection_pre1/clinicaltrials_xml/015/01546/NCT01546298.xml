	<detailed_description>Allergic contact dermatitis term skin reaction result exposure specific substance come contact skin hypersensitive ( allergic ) substance . These substance call `` allergen . '' Some common allergen nickel , rubber , dye , poison ivy , poison oak related plant . These allergen cause skin reaction individual , , skin becomes sensitive allergic substance , exposure specific allergen produce rash may consist redness , swell blister . This rash may become bad exposure allergen . The skin reaction result two phase . In induction phase , initial exposure allergen occur . The body recognize allergen foreign immune system , body 's primary line defense infection thing perceive foreign body , mount immune response body , . During immune response , cell specific allergen activate . In second phase , elicitation phase , skin expose allergen immune response occur , cell specific allergen attack skin , lead rash . In order diagnose allergic contact dermatitis , clinician discus material touch patient 's skin work home perform patch test . In patch test , small amount suspect allergen apply skin fixed time . After designated time , clinician determine whether reaction occur applied allergen . Currently , main treatment allergic contact dermatitis avoidance allergen . This study hop improve understand immune system act allergic contact dermatitis . In order reach goal , normal volunteer , suspect allergic contact dermatitis , patch test fifteen common allergen . Then , biopsy take skin site positive reaction allergen . Also , small biopsy take area receive patch allergen area receive patch serve control . In second stage study , volunteer receive patch allergen demonstrate allergic response . More biopsy take , three designate time point . The biopsied skin sample study laboratory method immunohistochemistry microarray analysis , help define progression immune reaction allergic contact dermatitis . The rationale study well understand immune system activate produce rash allergic contact dermatitis , treatment target cell involve activation .</detailed_description>
