	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm advanced solid malignancy ( include hepatocellular carcinoma lymphoma ) metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; /= 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; /=60 % ) Acceptable bone marrow function Normal vary degree renal hepatic impairment accord NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group criterion . Organ function stable least 2 week Day 1 . In addition , evidence acute exacerbation hepatic/renal disease . Patients gliomas know brain metastasis require corticosteroids anticonvulsant must stable dose corticosteroid seizure free 1 month prior enrollment . Patients know brain metastasis must least 4 week radiation start protocol ( Day 1 ) . Documented negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential For woman childbearing potential , agreement use two acceptable method contraception study 7 month discontinuation vismodegib For men female partner childbearing potential , agreement use latex , nonlatex , male condom advise female partner use additional acceptable method birth control study 2 month discontinuation study drug Agreement donate blood/blood product study 7 month discontinue study drug For men normal renal hepatic function , agreement provide semen vismodegib treatment period study assessment ( optional ) , otherwise NOT donate semen vismodegib treatment period 2 month discontinuation study drug Pregnancy lactation Chemotherapy , biologic therapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Investigational agent within 28 day prior study entry ( Day 1 ) Use Pgp inhibitor within 7 day Day 1 Use gastric pH alter drug except antacid within 7 day Day 1 Major surgery within 14 day prior treatment ( Day 1 ) . Patients recent major surgery must recover surgery . Patients expect major surgery study treatment period enrol . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use vismodegib might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk treatment complication . Severely impaired renal function ( Cohort 2 ) active hemolysis , hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis screen study treatment period ( Days 19 ) .</criteria>
