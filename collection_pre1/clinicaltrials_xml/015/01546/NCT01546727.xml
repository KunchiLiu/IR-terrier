	<detailed_description>Obesity affect estimate 2.8 million child age 2 5 year , prevalence obesity among preschool school age child almost triple 5 % population 1971-1980 13.9 % 2004 . Being obese age 5 confers 47 time great risk overweight obese age 12 . In fact obese time 2 5 year increase risk remain overweight obese adult four time risk nonobese preschooler . Being obese preschooler also increase risk number serious health condition , include 2.6 time great risk develop type 2 diabetes age 21 year . In fact , obesity rate among preschooler think impose cumulative health risk across life span child bear today , first time history , expect short life expectancy parent 2 5 year . Early effective treatment establish obesity preschool year potential change trajectory obesity relate co-morbid health condition across life-span reduce obesity change development lifestyle habit diet exercise time form . Yet research intervention reduce obesity preschool child severely limit none exist address establish obesity age group . Therefore current study potential significant impact public health provide evidence-based treatment obesity preschooler , developmental period eat activity pattern form , could significantly impact trajectory obesity thereby decrease population obesity rate associate healthcare cost across life span . Fortunately , investigator way address problem obesity reduction already obese preschooler . The investigator develop conduct pilot randomize clinical trial treatment program aim reduce obesity already obese preschool child . The program ( Learning Activity Understanding Nutrition Child Health : LAUNCH ) tailor developmental stage preschool child produce promising preliminary result . In proposed trial 3 arm , randomize , parallel group design test LAUNCH 1 ) motivational interviewing ( attention control ; MI ) 2 ) standard care ( true standard care control ; STC ) 168 child age 2 5 year meet criterion obesity ( &gt; 95th percentile body mass index ; BMI ) . Participants randomize receive 6 month intervention ( LAUNCH , MI ) standard care . The primary end-point change BMI z-score end treatment . The investigator also assess maintenance treatment gain 6 12 month treatment , change factor think mechanism change weight ( food intake activity level ) , change obesiogenic environment ( parent weight , food intake activity , change home food environment ) factor could negatively impact ( parent child eat feeding interaction ) .</detailed_description>
