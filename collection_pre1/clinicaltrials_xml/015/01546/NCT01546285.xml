	<brief_title>B40 Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Equivalency Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Automated non-invasive blood pressure device long history . These device first make appearance mid-1970 's . Since time , many improvement performance device . Specifically , make change algorithms control device , goal : improve accuracy precision blood pressure ( BP ) estimate , reduce time need determine BP estimate , increase comfort patient , work artifact arrhythmias often present clinical environment . The purpose study demonstrate equivalency GE Healthcare B40 Patient Monitor noninvasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) parameter compare reference device .</detailed_description>
