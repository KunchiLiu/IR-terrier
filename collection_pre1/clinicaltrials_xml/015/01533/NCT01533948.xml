	<brief_title>Axitinib Treating Patients With Melanoma That Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) axitinib advance melanoma . This assess use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , version 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate toxicity axitinib single agent . II . Determine progression-free survival overall survival . III . Explore utility 3'-deoxy-3'- [ 18F ] fluorothymidine-labeled positron emission tomography ( FLT-PET ) predictive marker response compare standard radiographic imaging . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine prognostic predictive significance circulate melanoma tumor cell . II . To examine whether functionally relevant polymorphism axitinib-related gene ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ VEGFR ] 1 , VEGFR2 VEGFR3 ) correlate efficacy toxicity axitinib advance melanoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive axitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
