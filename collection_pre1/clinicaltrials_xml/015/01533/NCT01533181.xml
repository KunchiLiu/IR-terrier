	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate OSI-906 compare Topotecan try slow growth and/or progression tumor participant relapse recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer . This study also plan find effect , good bad ( side effect ) , OSI-906 participant Small Cell Lung Cancer . The study also investigate protein measure blood tumor image feature obtain computed tomography ( CT ) scan help predict whether OSI-906 topotecan effective Small Cell Lung Cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linsitinib Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) single-agent OSI-906 ( linsitinib ) single-agent topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) patient relapse small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( RR ) , disease-control rate ( DCR ) overall survival ( OS ) single-agent OSI-906 patient relapse SCLC . II . To describe toxicity profile single-agent OSI-906 population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers OSI-906 sensitivity . II . To determine whether baseline insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 , IGF-binding protein ( BPs ) , angiogenic marker ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] interleukin [ IL ] -8 ) plasma level pre- post-treatment plasma level change , significantly differ progressor non-progressor patient correlate survival . III . To assess whether baseline protein kinase B ( AKT ) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) phosphorylation extent inhibition AKT and/or ERK phosphorylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) significantly differ progressors non-progressors correlate survival . IV . To determine whether subcellular localization IGF-1R , IGF-BPs , and/or phosphorylation IGF-1R throughout cell AQUA ( automate quantitative immunofluorescence ) significantly differ progressors non-progressors correlate survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive linsitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute PO daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Patients may crossover Arm I time progressive disease . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
