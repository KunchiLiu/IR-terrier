	<brief_title>Thoracoscopic Lobectomy Using Nonintubated Anesthesia Versus Intubated General Anesthesia Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Taiwan . Traditionally , open thoracotomy standard approach lung cancer surgery , include lobectomy pneumonectomy . With advance thoracoscopic technique , thoracoscopic lobectomy emerge reasonable option management early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , support evidence-based treatment guideline . Advantages thoracoscopic lobectomy compare thoracotomy include less postoperative pain , short hospitalization , decrease postoperative pulmonary complication . Traditionally , general anesthesia ( GA ) one-lung ventilation use double-lumen endotracheal intubation consider mandatory open thoracoscopic surgery . However , adverse effect GA may occur operation , include ventilator-induced lung injury , impaired cardiac performance , postoperative nausea vomiting , residual neuromuscular blockade . In order reduce adverse effect GA , nonintubated anesthesia recently employ perform thoracic surgery procedure include coronary artery bypass , management pneumothorax , resection pulmonary nodule solitary metastasis , lung volume reduction ( LVR ) , even transsternal thymectomy . The result achieve early series encouraging . In Taiwan , nonintubated thoracic surgery also perform Taipei Veteran General Hospital high risk patient satisfactory result . The role nonintubated anesthesia thoracoscopic lobectomy rarely investigate . There report show lobectomy use nonintubated anesthesia safe feasible , although 3 case report [ 13 ] . In hospital , also perform 6 thoracoscopic lobectomy use nonintubated anesthesia August October , 2009 satisfactory result . Until , safety effect nonintubated anesthesia thoracoscopic lobectomy unclear comparison nonintubated intubated general anesthesia never report . We hypothesize nonintubated thoracoscopic lobectomy associate comparable oncological result , low cardiopulmonary complication , shorter intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospital stay . To end , compare safety result thoracoscopic lobectomy use nonintubated anesthesia versus intubate general anesthesia lung cancer patient . This study perform National Taiwan University Hospital . A total 100 patient include ( 50 patient arm ) .</detailed_description>
