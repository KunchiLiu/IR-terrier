	<brief_title>Treatment Port-wine Mark Sturge-Weber Syndrome Using Topical Timolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Port-wine mark ( PWM ) represent congenital capillary malformation , characterize dilation malformation dermal capillary lack endothelial proliferation . It frequently see facial distribution trigeminal nerve . PWM persist throughout life involve ~0.3 % population . Although PWMs find circumstance , ~ 3 % patient facial PWM also afflict Sturge-Weber syndrome . PWMs cosmetic entity often serious social consequence , produce psychological trauma child parent . PWM involute time , , leave untreated , develop deep purple coloration , tissue hypertrophy , nodularity . Laser therapy , selectively destroy specific target within skin , currently commonly use approach treat PWM , although complete blanch PWM laser rarely achieve patient , 10-45 % patient Sturge-Weber show satisfactory outcome . Complications pulse dye laser treatment PWM include pyogenic granuloma , scabbing , cutaneous scarring , permanent hypo/hyperpigmentation . Laser treatment relatively contraindicated child darker skin coloration due result hypopigmentation may equally unsightly . Laser treatment cause substantial discomfort pain patient , often require general anesthesia child . This particularly true since earlier treatment infancy desirable yield increase successful resolution PWM . The hypertrophic PWM later year resistant treatment . Recently , propranolol report successfully treat capillary hemangioma infants.13 While mechanism beta blockade improve hemangioma unclear , ß2-mediated vasoconstrictive effect ensue apoptosis capillary endothelial cell may contribute positive therapeutic result . Oral application propranolol cause severe systemic complication , include bronchospasm , vasospasm , hypoglycemia , hypotension , severe bradycardia , heart block , congestive heart failure . Topical timolol solution , β-blocker , show similar ability reduce capillary hemangioma eyelid little systemic effect small pilot study . Similar capillary hemangioma , proliferative lesion characterize increase endothelial cell turnover , PWM capillary malformation abnormal endothelial cell large surface area dilate capillary . Thus , capillary hemangioma PWM share similar characteristic abnormal capillary endothelial cell . This pilot study design explore potential role topical timolol management PWM . As PWM frequently associate Sturge-Weber syndrome , disorder approximately 50 % patient develop glaucoma , study conduct ophthalmology set . This study consist two arm . One group receive timolol second group placebo preservative free artificial tear gel . The group divide ratio 1:1 Timolol group match placebo group PWM location , age race . Both medication apply rubbed fingertip treatment site twice day 6 month subject 's parents/guardian . ( Treatment site : 1x1 cm inferior edge facial PWM ) Follow-up schedule : 1 week treatment initiation every 2 month period six month .</detailed_description>
