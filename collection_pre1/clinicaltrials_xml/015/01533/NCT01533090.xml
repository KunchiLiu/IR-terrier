	<brief_title>Evaluation Reduced-volume PEG Bowel Preparation Administered Same Day Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) electrolyte lavage solution ( PEG-ELS ) originally develop 1980 Fordtran group isosmotic preparation minimal water electrolyte exchange plasma ensure safe cleanse bowel mechanical effect large-volume lavage . The conventional total dose 4 L give day procedure safe effective standard cleanse regimen last 25 year . To overcome difficulty complete bowel preparation due large volume and/or taste , reduced-volume ( mixed ) bowel preparation bisacodyl 2 L PEG-ELS show provide adequate colon cleanse good tolerability . In last recent year , time preparation demonstrate critical factor bowel preparation colonoscopy . Several study demonstrate reduce time interval completion bowel preparation exam improve colon cleanse compare standard dose regimen PEG-electrolyte solution give day colonoscopy . At time manufacturer try improve taste palatability PEG formulation add suitable ingredient ascorbic acid citric acid . LoVol-esse reduced-volume PEG-based bowel preparation use combination bisacodyl design improve patient tolerability attitude toward bowel cleanse prior colonoscopy thanks reduce volume improve taste . The present study intend compare new dose regimen bowel lavage solution give day compare standard PEG formulation ( SELG 1000 ) give day colonoscopy . The result study tell u last-hour preparation effective offer adequate tolerability compliance adopt clinical practice .</detailed_description>
