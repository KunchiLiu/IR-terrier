	<brief_title>Linsitinib Treating Patients With Asymptomatic Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate time prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression base Prostate Cancer Working Group ( PCWG2 ) criterion . II . To evaluate PSA response ( proportion patient achieve PSA decline &gt; 50 % accord PCWG2 criterion patient receive linsitinib [ OSI-906 ] ) . III . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) patient Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) -defined measurable disease receive OSI-906 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect OSI-906 time-to opiate use cancer pain . II . To evaluate effect OSI-906 radiographic progression-free survival ( rPFS ) patient asymptomatic mildly symptomatic ( non-opioid requiring ) castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient asymptomatic mildly symptomatic ( non-opioid requiring ) CRPC receive OSI-906 . IV . To evaluate safety OSI-906 patient asymptomatic mildly symptomatic ( non-opioid requiring ) CRPC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe effect OSI-906 level androstenedione , dehydroepiandrostenedione ( DHEA ) , DHEA-sulfate , p insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-IR ) , p-insulin receptor ( IR ) . ( Exploratory ) II . To describe effect OSI-906 level transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta ( b1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha ( ) , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) marker metastatic progression . ( Exploratory ) III . To describe effect OSI-906 number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) endothelial cell ( CECs ) . ( Exploratory ) IV . To use ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) extract CTCs evaluate effect downstream target IGF-1R signal OSI-906 treatment . ( Exploratory ) V. To measure effect OSI-906 expression IGF-1R CTCs . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients receive linsitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo serum plasma sample collection baseline , day 1 course 2 4 , completion study treatment correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
