	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct study patient eye infection call adenoviral conjunctivitis , common cause `` pink eye '' . There currently treatment condition . However , researcher associate study want understand use product call Zirgan , topical ointment already FDA-approved type eye infection , help type infection patient currently . Zirgan FDA-approved treat type eye infection . Your participation study expect last 21 day patient apply topical ointment 14 day . During study , patient ask come clinic 8 time . The purpose study determine whether topical Zirgan reduce day patient suffers eye infection , also see prevent infection spread second eye also see prevent spread infection people patient come close contact . Zirgan compare Genteal Gel trial . Genteal Gel non-prescription eye lubricant gel commonly use treatment dry eye . The patient ask apply topical ointment ( either Zirgan Genteal gel 5 time day first 7 day 3 time day follow 7 day . The patient ask return clinic 21 day patient start study final check-up . It plan 80 people Adenovirus Conjunctivitis enrol study 8-12 site across United States . The patient assign either Zirgan Genteal gel chance similar flip coin . The study group assign 1:1 ratio . Neither patient study doctor study staff able pick study group The patient . The patient know study doctor study staff know study group patient . The study doctor study staff find necessary know health . If happens , study doctor study staff may able tell patient study group patient everyone finish study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo Controlled Comparison Topical Zirgan Versus Genteal Gel Treatment Adenovirus Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives To evaluate safety efficacy 0.15 % ganciclovir gel ( Zirgan® ) patient adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis comparison 0.3 % hypromellose gel ( Genteal gel® ) placebo . Background Adenoviruses common cause ocular viral infection worldwide . Conjunctivitis keratoconjunctivitis cause adenovirus highly contagious . Adenovirus non-enveloped , double-stranded DNA virus comprise 53 serotypes . Unlike many enveloped virus easily inactivate , adenoviruses resilient disinfection long lasting fomite . The ocular infection generally begin unilaterally , many case , spread eye . It may cause epidemic endemic , commonly spread summer winter . Epidemics common day care center , school military spread office eye care professional . Patients may painful conjunctival membrane palpable preauricular adenopathy . Subsequent subepithelial corneal infiltrates cause light sensitivity , reduce vision lead irregular astigmatism . The differential diagnosis include herpes simplex , Chlamydia enteroviral infection . There 3 major presentation ocular adenovirus infection : Follicular conjunctivitis ( predominantly serotypes 3 , 4,7a ) ; epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC ; predominantly serotypes 8 , 19 , 37 , 53 ) ; pharyngealconjunctival fever ( mostly serotypes 3 , 4 , 7a , 11 ) . There support laboratory clinical data warrant clinical trial topical ganciclovir treatment adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis . Several study show ganciclovir ( GCV ) active vitro adenovirus . Primary Outcome The primary outcome study determine whether topical 0.15 % ganciclovir ( Zirgan® ) gel alone reduce duration viral shed ocular surface , determine quantitative viral isolation A549 cell tissue culture , compare placebo 0.3 % hypromellose gel ( Genteal gel® ) . Secondary Outcomes The secondary outcome study whether topical 0.15 % ganciclovir ( 1 ) reduce incidence severity second eye involvement , ( 2 ) reduce incidence severity subepithelial infiltrates , ( 3 ) reduce secondary spread family member , friend , classmates co-worker ( The virus stable room temperature last day fomite , like towel , doorknob , etc ) , ( 4 ) reduce degree bulbar conjunctival injection ( redness eye , determine Efron scale Appendix 2 ) , ( 5 ) reduce ocular discomfort , ( 6 ) consider effective treatment patient . Sample Size The sample size study base objective demonstrate statistically significant difference primary outcome measure ( i.e. , time viral eradication ) . Approximately 350 subject screen Rapid Pathogens Screening ( RPS ) Adeno Detector Plus Immunoassay adenovirus ( applied conjunctiva involve eye ) allow recruitment approximately 80 RPS positive subject study , approximately 40 subject per treatment group ( randomization ratio 1:1 ) , anticipation approximately 40 culture positive subject per treatment group ( assume 100 % culture positivity rate ) 38 culture positive subject per treatment group complete study ( assume 5 % dropout rate ) . Thirty eight viral positive culture subject per treatment group yield 90 % power detect statistically significant difference time viral eradication ganciclovir gel 0.15 % placebo ( hypromellose gel ) assuming : ( 1 ) mean time viral eradication 7.0 day placebo group 5.5 day ganciclovir group , ( 2 ) estimate standard deviation 2.0 day group , ( 3 ) use two-sided α = 0.05 ( two sample comparison mean ) . The estimate approximately 320 350 screening find approximately 80 RPS positive subject base previous study document approximately 25 % prevalence adenoviral conjunctivitis among patient acute conjunctivitis . The estimated mean time viral eradication 7.0 day placebo base placebo arm previous study evaluate safety efficacy cidofovir treatment viral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis estimate mean time viral eradication 5.5 day base assume clinically significant decrease 1.5 day compare placebo arm . Virological Studies At first study visit , low palpebral conjunctiva eye rub six eight time use Rapid Pathogen Screening ( RPS ) Adeno Detector Plus Immunoassay device . A positive result involve eye require meet entry criterion . For patient entered randomized treatment placebo arm , virologic study quantitative culture , PCR confirmation viral serotyping use DNA sequencing perform ,</detailed_description>
