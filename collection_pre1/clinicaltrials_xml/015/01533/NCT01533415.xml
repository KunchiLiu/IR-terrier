	<brief_title>Use Alpha-Stim Cranial-electrotherapy Stimulation ( CES ) Treatment Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate efficacy Alpha-Stim technology treatment anxiety use double-blind clinical trial period five week . Cranial-electrotherapy stimulation ( CES ) noninvasive procedure use decade United States treat anxiety , depression , insomnia . Although many study CES publish previous decade , use relatively small sample use various frequency link treatment . Given positive result many general study perform date , study seek add current literature address previous criticism use large sample size ( n=150 ) use participant represent single type anxiety along comorbidity . Such population believe well represent typical treatment complication . Participants recruit via advertisement local newspaper post flyer around local university campus . Participants screen intake process use Structured Clinical Interview Axis I Disorders ( SCID-I ) confirm diagnosis anxiety disorder . Comorbid condition acceptable , however , anxiety disorder must primary diagnosis . As part intake process , participant complete Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D17 ) establish baseline . These instrument serve primary efficacy measure . In order participate , HAM-A score must equal great 18 ( Moderate Anxiety ) . Depression monitor use The HAM-D17 depression commonly occur condition anxiety HAM-D17 also sensitive anxiety . Current treatment medication also acceptable provide change dosage type study . See Inclusions Exclusions information . All participant pay fee $ 30 enter study cover administration cost way measure placebo effect . Participants assigned device take home self-administer treatment 5-7 day week . Participants require log treatment time date log provide researcher . The student population give take home device receive treatment Graduate Assistant 's Office Student Care Office . Electromedical Products International , Inc. agree supply device need carry research include conductance solution , felt tab , battery . Half device set manufacturer deliver treatment 0.5 Hz low therapeutic setting . The remain device shame deliver therapeutic benefit . The device able altered participant . Participants meet PI research assistant complete HAM-A HAM-D17 week 1 , 3 , 5 designate location either researcher private practice office university lab location . Adverse treatment reaction also note . Treatment log also collect point . At week 1 3 , participant give fresh battery , conductance solution , felt tab need . At completion study , participant find shame treatment group offer normal course treatment . Participants want continue study wish follow normal treatment shame group refund fee . The hypothesis study seek address : H° : There difference sham treatment active CES level anxiety compare score HAM-A HAM-D17 . H¹ : The active CES treatment group significantly low anxiety score HAM-A HAM-D17 sham group endpoint study . Statistical analysis compare baseline score ( week 1 ) midpoint score ( week , 3 ) , score endpoint study ( week 5 ) . Response treatment define improvement 30 % great HAM-A HAM-D17 endpoint study . The impact prescription medication confound variable relation effect CES anxiety depression also examine . Data analysis consist repeat measure design likely use general linear model SPSS hierarchical linear quadratic growth model ass individual change . The reason approach hierarchical analysis individual change advantageous multiple repeat measure data pattern affords research opportunity combine single analysis ( Raudenbush &amp; Byrk , 2002 ) . We estimate individual growth mean growth point time series . Cross-validation quadratic occur via estimation piecewise linear growth model ass whether growth variable one period another study time frame . Optimal design software use make preliminary determination 100 participant randomize quadratic growth individual change model achieve power .80 .95 study expect effect size 0.6 .80 , respectively ( 0.62 premise upon meta-analysis CES undertaken Klawansky , et al. , 1995 .8 consider large effect Cohen , 1988 ) . We employ power analysis sample size confirm follow recruitment participant expect upwards 150 participant . Missing data explain use intent-to-treat analysis whereby employ redundant analysis procedure ( i.e. , survival analysis ) understand context true treatment effect .</detailed_description>
