	<brief_summary>The pharmacokinetics caspofungin expect different ICU patient compare non-ICU patient . The investigator determine caspofungin concentration 20 ICU patient , get caspofungin standard care . Full PK curve take day 3 limited PK curve day 7 , trough level take daily .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics caspofungin expect different ICU patient compare non-ICU patient healthy volunteer due underlying disease ( ) . Therefore , extrapolation data healthy volunteer non-ICU patient possible . To able include 20 patient within study duration , multi-centre approach necessary . Patients receive standard care , state SPC accord local protocol . Blood sample PK analysis retrieve central venous catheter . Approximately 60mL drawn total study . Patients monitor daily treatment period adverse event study drug . Although steady state caspofungin achieve approximately 14 day treatment , full PK curve take day 3 . As probably patient include treated caspofungin 14 day , take full PK curve day 14 consider feasible . These two moment PK analysis enable determination steady state enable determination intra-individual variability .</detailed_description>
