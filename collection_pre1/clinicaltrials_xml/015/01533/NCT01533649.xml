	<brief_summary>The assumption unpredictability seizure may enormous impact perception self-efficacy may contribute patient 's poor quality-of-life actual seizure . Patients epilepsy especially susceptible influence arbitrary nature condition socialization , education , formation self-identity . Consequentially , psychosocial psychological aftermath likely observe even individual well-controlled seizure . The relationship seizure occurrence effect epileptic seizure quality life characterize reciprocal ; e.g . emotional stress result seizure ; also frequently report seizure precipitant . Whereas behavioral intervention repeatedly consider third pillar treatment epilepsy , main focus still remain passive seizure control per pharmacological surgical intervention , may aggravate victimization . Outcome epilepsy surgery closely correlate pre-surgical characteristic . Consequentially , upsurge interest medical community research non-pharmacologic intervention facilitate transition chronically sick well preventive therapeutic intervention context habitual seizure . The Andrews/Reiter ( AR ) approach epilepsy systematic counseling intervention assist individual identify seizure warn sign , seizure precipitant general life stressor order develop strategy active seizure control improve self-defined life quality . Literature review indicate AR represent comprehensively developed psychological approach . The propose trial address question AR decrease seizure frequency psychopathologic comorbidities increase seizure self-efficacy overall quality life patient medically intractable epilepsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subject systematically approach 3 year enrollment period recruit consecutive sample patient population receive care tertiary care epilepsy center ( Toronto Western Hospital ) . After 8 week period establish baseline measurement propose trial allocate study subject A/R intervention group relaxation/meditation control group usual care control group ( N1=N2=N3=10 ) per preference due fact internalization therapeutic principle active process require continuous motivation compliance patient intervention . If subject display high intrinsic motivation engage self-care enhancing activity indicate preference , get randomize either A/R intervention relaxation protocol . This trial design allow measure effect size regard potential effect choice , also whether interaction preference treatment . This trial determine following : I . The fraction ( ) seizure-free subject ( b ) subject clinically meaningful , i.e . ≥ 90 % ≥ 50 reduction seizure frequency , II . Changes subjective perception disability indicate Subjective Handicap Epilepsy Scale ( SHE ) , III . Changes seizure self-efficacy indicated Multidimensional Health Locus Control ( M-HLOC ) , Form C Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale ( ESES ) , IV . Changes common psychopathologic comorbidities stress indicate ( ) Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory Epilepsy ( NDDI-E ) , ( b ) State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , ( c ) Profile Mood States ( POMS brief ) , ( ) Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) , V. Changes quality life indicate ( ) Quality Life Epilepsy ( QOLIE-89 ) , ( b ) individually identify descriptor various domain life ( c ) individually identify epilepsy-related distress . Continuous measure ( aim I III b ) obtain month 9 10 initial subject enrollment . All measure obtain end month 10 . Intervention Protocols : During month 3-5 A/R intervention protocol devote one face-to-face counseling session 11 chapter ( `` step '' ) workbook `` Taking control epilepsy '' follow weekly phone call month 6-8 . A/R treatment plan include daily activity : Journaling ( 10 min ) , CD-guided relaxation ( 10-30 min ) , Workbook ( 10 min ) promote functional analysis seizure context development cop strategy . The trial use knowledge-translation trainee deliver intervention supervise Donna Andrews , PhD , co-developer AR intervention . The relaxation meditation protocol consist weekly 30 min session month 3-5 bi-weekly 60 min session month 6-8 . All subject instruct document seizure occurrence ( number type ) compliance AEDs . They continue see treat neurologist adjustment antiepileptic medication make necessary . Medication change include outcome analysis . Regular serum level draw monitor drug compliance . Study subject approach 12 , 24 36 month end pilot trial obtain follow-up data . The sample size determination investigator base literature review , assume remission rate usual care group 5 % 35 % A/R intervention group inflate 30 % account loss non-compliance . Outcomes compare find group whole .</detailed_description>
