	<brief_summary>Non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 80 % lung cancer . The main treatment early stage patient surgical resection , 30 % -70 % patient relapse . Postoperative chemotherapy major systemic treatment surgical resection NSCLC patient . However , data show 5-10 % improvement overall survival systemic adjuvant chemotherapy . It necessary improve survival time patient lung cancer . Biological treatment become new treatment modality Cancer follow surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy , confirm effective adjuvant treatment comprehensive cancer treatment . Cytokine induce killer cell ( CIK ) characterize fast amplification , strong anti-cancer activity broad anti-tumor spectrum widely use think first choice new generation anti-tumor adoptive immunotherapy . This Phase II study investigate efficacy Autologous Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell Transfusion plus Chemotherapy adjuvant therapy stage IB-IIIA NSCLC .</brief_summary>
