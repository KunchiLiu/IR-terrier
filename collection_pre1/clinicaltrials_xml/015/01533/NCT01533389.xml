	<detailed_description>Lower mid ureteral calculus , account approximately 70 % ureteral calculus , high chance successful treatment thanks ureteroscopic lithotripsy extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) 1-3 ) , time problem postprocedural complication high expenses4 ) . A low ureteral calculus , measure 5 millimeter less , may easily expel symptomatic therapy . Actually , 50 % chance successful expulsion5 ) . However , complication urinary tract infection hydronephrosis persistent pain may occur expel . Thus , imperative minimize occurrence complication process expectant treatment also reduce time require expel calculus . It recently report pharmacotherapy adhibited expulsion urinary calculus relief pain . The migration ureteral calculus influence calculus ureter . In case calculus , size , shape , number location influence . In regard ureter , significantly influence cramp ureteral smooth muscle , edema ureteral submucosa , pain cause calculus activity adrenoreceptors6 ) . Pharmacotherapy relieve ureteral obstruction thus expel urinary calculus easily . Ureteral obstruction , cause urinary calculus , obtund ureteral peristalsis strengthen ureteral contraction , may cause urinary retention regurgitation7-8 ) . In connection , study conduct method reduce abnormal urinary reaction cause urinary calculus smoothen uroflow . Currently , hormone drug include hydroxyprogesterone , prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor , calcium-channel antagonist , α1-blockers steroid drug use expel urinary calculus suppress pain . The guideline urinary calculus , drawn 2007 , recommend use α-blockers superior drug efficacy9-12 ) . The drug use clinical trial , silodosin , register proprietary name 'THRUPAS® Capsule 4mg ' market authorized Korea Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , selectively act α1A-adrenoreceptor . This clinical trial evaluate efficacy silodosin , selective α1A-blocker , calculous expulsion expectant treatment patient low mid ureteral calculus .</detailed_description>
