	<brief_title>Viral Therapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability Reolysin patient relapse multiple myeloma . II . Obtain evidence Reovirus replication immunohistochemical co-localization Reovirus tubulin stain marrow clot section obtain cycle 1 day 8 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary data response determine International Myeloma Working Group criteria infusion Reolysin single agent . ( Clinical ) II . Obtain pilot overall progression free survival data treat patient . ( Clinical ) III . Assess neutralize anti-reovirus assay ( NARA ) result day 1 , 8 , 15 , day 22-28 cycle 1 . ( Correlative ) IV . Assess feasibility stain RAF/MEK/ERK CD138+ cell use marrow clot section obtain pre-treatment specimen . ( Correlative ) V. Cryopreserve PBMCs future ancillary study focus initially lymphocyte subset ( ) myeloid derive suppressor cell change Reolysin infusion cycle 1 . ( Correlative ) VI . Cryopreserve CD138+-selected cell screen treatment future ancillary study genetic epigenetic change focus part endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . ( Correlative ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate baseline periodically study RAF/MEK/ERK expression wild-type reovirus replication analysis immunohistochemistry . Blood cryopreserved CD138+ select cell sample also collect future ancillary study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
