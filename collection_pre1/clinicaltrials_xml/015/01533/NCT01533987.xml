	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity adult child United States increase significantly past 50 year . More 66 % adult US overweight obese least 17 % child population large consider overweight . Obesity may factor predispose patient myriad different comorbidities increase associate mortality rate . Several large prospective trial document obesity independent risk factor all-cause mortality cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Considering major metabolic biochemical change occur obesity , atherogenic dyslipidemia , insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia , endothelial dysfunction , chronic inflammatory prothrombotic state , obesity play role pathogenesis systemic atherosclerosis clinical complication . Antioxidants think help preserve endothelium 's capacity generate NO , act promote vasodilation , stabilize platelet , promote anti-inflammatory ability endothelium . Juice Plus+® Capsules contain Orchard , Garden Vineyard blend rich traditional antioxidant β-carotene , Vitamin E Vitamin C along carotenoids phytonutrients . There increase attention possibility micronutrient may exert health effect concert . Outcomes study isolate micronutrient , vitamin E , often often disappointing . Plant-derived micronutrient potential contribute vascular health offer endothelium protection oxidative stress . Evidence anticipated effect would implications strategy prevent retard cardiovascular disease . Endothelial function test use high-frequency ultrasound image brachial artery ass endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) offer non-invasive , uniquely valuable mean assess aggregated influence cardiac risk gauge physiologic response vascular endothelium . Proposed , therefore , randomize , double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial Juice Plus+® endothelial function overweight men central adiposity .</detailed_description>
