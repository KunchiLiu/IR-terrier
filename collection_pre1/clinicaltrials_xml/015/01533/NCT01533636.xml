	<brief_summary>The investigator collect sample sputum healthy volunteer patient cystic fibrosis purpose : ) purify airway mucin plate-based binding study ; b ) assessment effect carbohydrates rheologic property sputum . This study two hypothesis : 1 . Lectins Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aspergillus fumigatus bind airway mucins fucose-dependent manner , bind inhibit fucosyl glycomimetic compound . 2 . Fucosyl glycomimetics compete Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin ( PA-IIL ) Aspergillus fumigatus lectin ( AFL ) disrupt lectin-driven mucin cross-linking CF sputum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pseudomonas lung infection major cause morbidity mortality occur multiple clinical setting . Patients cystic fibrosis lung colonization Pseudomonas early age , overwhelm pseudomonal lung infection common cause death patient . In addition , Pseudomonas pneumonia common immunocompromised patient patient intubated management respiratory failure . Particularly worrisome increase frequency P. aeruginosa isolates resistant currently available antibiotic . The mechanism virulence P. aeruginosa include soluble lectin recognize host oligosaccharide mucin cell glycocalyx . P. aeruginosa two soluble lectin - LecA , also know PA-IL LecB , also know PA-IIL . PA-IL bind galactose PA-IIL bind fucose . Notably , PA-IIL bind fucose contain Lewis oligosaccharide high affinity role PA-IIL biofilm formation show absence biofilm formation Pseudomonas mutant lack PA-IIL efficacy multivalent fucosyl-peptide dendrimers prevent disrupt Pseudomonas biofilm formation . D-galactose L-fucose successfully use treat P. aeruginosa infection case report , hint potential glycomimetic therapy CF . These monosaccharide weak inhibitor PA-IIL , however , multivalent glycomimetics need effective inhibition . Aspergillus fumigatusinfection responsible majority human animal aspergillosis disease , even though air sample study show conidia usually comprise small percentage total airborne fungal challenge . It primary opportunistic pathogen , particularly troublesome patient cystic fibrosis . It cause multiple lung disease , includingchronic pulmonary aspergillosis , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , invasive pulmonary aspergillosis . Aspergillomas also occur patient cavitary lung disease . Together , disease cause significant morbidity mortality , available treatment suboptimal . Most patient chronic pulmonary aspergillosis require antifungal therapy many month year , many experience significant drug side effect , experience drug resistance . Patients either allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA ) severe asthma fungal sensitization improve itraconazole treatment , relapse common , itraconazole affect corticosteroid metabolism potential worsen steroid side effect . ABPA require long-term treatment Aspergillus airway colonization difficult eradicate quickly recur treatment stop . Immunocompromised patient especially vulnerable invasive aspergillosis mortality rate often 50 % , even antifungal treatment . Clearly , therefore , new treatment approach need lung disease cause A. fumigatus , propose approach base prevention bind airway mucin . Adherence A. fumigatus conidium host tissue subject extensive research , little attention direct Aspergillus/mucin interaction , surprising deficiency give role mucin play airway biology . This study ex-vivo study collect sample sputum healthy volunteer patient cystic fibrosis purpose : ) purify airway mucin plate-based binding study ; b ) ex-vivo assessment effect carbohydrates rheologic property sputum .</detailed_description>
