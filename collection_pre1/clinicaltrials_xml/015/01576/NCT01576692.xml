	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy , Monoclonal Antibody , Natural Killer Cells Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participant receive chemotherapy combine Hu14.18K322A antibody daily four consecutive day . Those participant go receive second course chemotherapy Hu14.18K322A receive infusion allogeneic NK cell 4th dose Hu14.18K322A antibody . A maximum six course give . Primary Objective : - To observe describe toxicity associate humanized anti-GD2 antibody ( hu14.18K322A ) without allogeneic NK cell give repeat cycle chemotherapy child refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma . Secondary Objective : - To describe response , time progression , event-free overall survival . - To evaluate feasibility administer NK cell suitable donor completion last dose hu14.18K322A three repeat cycle chemotherapy</detailed_description>
