	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm solid malignancy lymphoma metastatic unresectable , standard curative palliative measure exist , longer effective . In case hepatocellular carcinoma , diagnosis base least one following : 1 . The presence least one lesion , measure ≥ 2 cm , characteristic arterial enhancement venous washout set liver cirrhosis and/or hepatitis B C infection . 2 . The presence liver lesion ( ) ( define . ) AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL . 3 . Tissue confirmation . Biliary obstruction biliary drain stent place eligible , provide drain stent place least 10 day prior first dose crizotinib , liver function stabilize define 2 measurement least 5 day apart put patient hepatic dysfunction stratum define Section 3 . Presence glioma brain metastasis neurologically stable treat without ongoing requirement corticosteroid least 2 week . Any prior systemic therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , molecularly target agent , immunotherapy , etc . ) major surgery must complete least 30 day ( determined local requirement , whichever long ) , least 5 half life drug half live 6 day longer prior initiation crizotinib treatment . Any prior radiation ( except palliative ) minor surgeries/procedures must complete least 2 week prior initiation crizotinib treatment . Palliative radiation ( ≤ 10 fraction ) must complete 48 hour prior initiation crizotinib treatment . Any acute toxicity must recover Grade ≤1 ( except alopecia ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] performance status 02 . Adequate organ function patient receive crizotinib therapy define follow criterion : Bone marrow function Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 750/uL Platelets ≥ 30,000/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL ( ≥ 7.0 g/dL hematologic malignancy ) Renal function Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient serum creatinine level institutional 1.5 x ULN Male female patient childbearing potential must agree use highly effective method contraception throughout study least 28 day last dose assign treatment . A patient childbearing potential , opinion investigator , he/she biologically capable child sexually active . Untreated esophageal varix observe EGD image study ; however , patient know portal hypertension evidence varix EGD image study undergone appropriate therapy indicate within last 6 month ( applicable ) eligible enrollment . Uncontrolled ascites stable medical management ( i.e. , diuretic salt restriction ) define require therapeutic paracentesis every 4 week . Episodes hepatic encephalopathy within last 4 week . Patients prior episode hepatic encephalopathy clinically stable lactulose , neomycin , and/or xifaxan therapy allow . Prior therapy crizotinib . Spinal cord compression . Carcinomatous meningitis leptomeningeal disease Any follow within 6 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack . Symptomatic congestive heart failure . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation grade , average triplicate QTc interval &gt; 470 msec . History extensive disseminated/bilateral know presence interstitial fibrosis interstitial lung disease , include history pneumonitis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , interstitial pneumonia , interstitial lung disease , obliterative bronchiolitis , pulmonary fibrosis , history prior radiation pneumonitis . Active hemolysis evidence biliary sepsis . Pregnant female ; breastfeed female ; male females childbearing potential ; male females childbearing potential use highly effective contraception agree continue highly effective contraception least 28 day last dose investigational product ; male females childbearing potential use two ( 2 ) method highly effective contraception agree continue two ( 2 ) method highly effective contraception least 28 day last dose investigational product . Use drug food know strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , include limited atazanavir , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , troleandomycin , voriconazole , grapefruit grapefruit juice . Use drug know strong CYP3A4 inducer , include limited carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , rifabutin , rifampin , St. John 's wort . Use drug CYP3A4 substrates narrow therapeutic index , include limited dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , pimozide . Other severe acute chronic medical ( may include severe gastrointestinal condition chronic diarrhea ulcer disease ) psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate study entry . Patients prior major gastrointestinal surgery remove part gastrointestinal tract and/or gall bladder .</criteria>
