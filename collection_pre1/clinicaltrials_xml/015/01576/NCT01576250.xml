	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect lower physical activity ( result decrease muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity ) alone together increased plasma free fatty acid availability ( infusion clinically widely use lipid emulsion ( Intralipid ) ) insulin sensitivity glucose lipid metabolism . To end , compare skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity glucose lipid metabolism ( within one subject ) 9 day immobilization one leg ( unilateral low limb suspension ( ULLS ) ) ( decreased muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity ) versus active control leg ( unchanged muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity ) . Further , change IMCL fatty acid intermediate investigate immobilized v control leg , related insulin sensitivity . The effectiveness ULLS intervention test measure muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity immobilize control leg . All measurement perform immobilized control leg 9 day ULLS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Netherlands worldwide , number individual suffer obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus rise steadily . It well establish obesity predisposes individual accumulation excessive fat non-adipose tissue liver , heart skeletal muscle ( call steatosis ectopic fat accumulation ) . Furthermore , sedentary human ectopic fat accumulation skeletal muscle strongly associate insulin resistance . However , paradoxically , IntraMyoCellular Lipid ( IMCL ) content also increase highly insulin sensitive endurance train subject ( know athlete 's paradox ) . This suggest IMCL per se causative skeletal muscle insulin resistance . The increased IMCL storage follow endurance train serf match training-induced increase oxidative capacity reliance fat substrate exercise , whereas obesogenic/diabetogenic condition high fat availability match improved oxidative capacity . It therefore speculate latter condition , lipid intermediate IMCL metabolism diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , ceramides fatty acyl-CoAs accumulate impede cellular insulin signalling . The rate oxidative capacity regulate mitochondrion , cellular organelle responsible cellular energy production cellular metabolism . Therefore , overall hypothesis project low muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity lead muscle fat accumulation and/or accumulation lipid intermediate fatty acid availability high , may result insulin resistance skeletal muscle .</detailed_description>
