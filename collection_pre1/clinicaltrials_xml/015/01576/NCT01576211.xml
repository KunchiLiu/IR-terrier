	<brief_title>Studying Genes Using Cord Blood Placenta Samples From Relatively Healthy Newborns Samples From Younger Patients With Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - What frequency loss imprint birth ( cord blood placenta ) relatively healthy birth cohort ? - Does deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation level imprint gene direct association gene expression ? OUTLINE : Archived tumor tissue , cord blood , placenta sample analyze DNA methylation , single nucleotide polymorphism , gene expression polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , pyrosequencing , quantitative real-time PCR . Information regard gender age sample also collect , possible .</detailed_description>
