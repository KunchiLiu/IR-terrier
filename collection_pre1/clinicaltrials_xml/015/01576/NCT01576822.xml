	<brief_title>Sauna Detoxification Study : Pilot Feasibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According nationwide survey Naturopathic Physicians regard use detoxification , approximately 80 percent NDs ( Naturopathic Doctors ) use type detoxification intervention clinical practice regular basis . Of intervention use , 66 % respondent report use sauna therapy . Of condition treat , 80 percent practitioner use sauna-based detoxification `` general cleansing/preventive medicine . '' This protocol utilize sauna primary method detoxification . Previous study hyperthermia-based protocol detoxification methodologically challenge readily reproducible . Furthermore , study literature identify long protocol tolerate , feasible general population , long need observe PCB ( pollutant reduction ) . Therefore , employ `` high-dose '' protocol `` low-dose '' protocol , base range report literature , order evaluate dose-finding outcome hyperthermia , include tolerability , retention , participant-reported outcome . High Dose Participants randomize group undergo protocol consist 2 hour sauna therapy per day , minimum 5 day per week , complete 3 week less ( 21 day ) . ( 15 total session , 30 hour sauna ) . Participants able schedule visit 7 day per week . Maximum flexibility hour operation well flexibility day attend utilized increase likelihood retention . A participant may attend visit 15 consecutive day , wish . Low Dose Participants randomize group undergo protocol consist 1 hour sauna therapy per day , minimum 3 day per week , complete 3 week less ( 21 day ) . ( 9 total session , 9 hour sauna ) . Participants able schedule visit 7 day per week . Maximum flexibility hour operation well flexibility day attend utilized increase likelihood retention . Participants able attend 9 consecutive session , wish .</detailed_description>
