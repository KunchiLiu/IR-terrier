	<brief_title>fMRI Predictors Treatment Response Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) highly prevalent debilitate disorder . It define fearful response traumatic event , clinical picture include reexperiencing , arousal , avoidance reminder exposure . Despite effort characterize pathophysiology PTSD , biomarkers establish aid diagnosis , treatment development , prediction treatment response . Several line evidence suggest PTSD symptom mediate dysfunctional process involve brain 's fear-circuitry network general , extinction learn recall deficit particular . Based preliminary work apply fear extinction task healthy human patient PTSD goal renewal RO1 application employ establish extinction paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) Skin Conductance Response ( SCR ) assessments large well characterized sample PTSD trauma expose healthy control ( TE-HC ) subject . We plan clarify circuit underlie PTSD psychopathology probe , first time , neural circuitry symptomatic improvement response Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) treatment . This goal congruent NIMH strategic plan strategy 1.3 ( `` identify integrate biological marker behavioral indicator associate mental disorder '' ) . One hundred subject include 60 individual principal diagnosis PTSD 40 trauma expose healthy control assess fMRI SCR determine neural circuitry activation fear extinction task . fMRI data acquire simultaneously fear extinction recall measurement quantify SCR . All 60 PTSD subject 20 randomly assign TE-HCs subject repeat procedures 10 week later , PTSD subject complete 10 week intensive PE treatment . Three month treatment completion clinical rating PTSD severity conduct permit analysis neural predictor long term treatment durability . The aim accomplish four year study , conduct multi-disciplinary research team , comprise research scientist Columbia , Harvard New York Universities , conduct study PTSD structural functional brain imaging . If successful , study produce highly need information neural circuitry underlies deficient extinction recall PTSD , provide highly important information neural effect Prolonged Exposure treatment , first line treatment PTSD . Together line expect finding advance identification biomarkers associate PTSD , also facilitate identification biomarkers clinical reponse empirically support treatment .</detailed_description>
