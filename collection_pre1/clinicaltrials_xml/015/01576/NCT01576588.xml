	<criteria>The diagnosis CD20 positive chronic B lymphocytic leukemia ( BCLL ) confirm biopsy flowcytometry . Previously treat patient stage Rai IIV progressive disease ( accord IWCLL 2008 guideline ) . Active BCLL define least one following : At least one disease relate symptom : Constitutional symptom : Weight loss &gt; 10 % within previous 6 month ; Fatigue ( e.g. , WHO performance status &gt; /=2 ) ; Fever &gt; /=38C &gt; /=2 week without evidence infection ; Night sweat 1 month without evidence infection . Evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development , worsen , anemia and/or thrombocytopenia Autoimmune hemolysis and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive corticosteroid therapy . Massive ( i.e. , &gt; /=6 cm bellow leave costal margin ) progressive symptomatic splenomegaly . Massive lymphadenopathy conglomerate ( i.e. , &gt; /=10 cm large diameter ) progressive symptomatic lymphadenopathy . Progressive lymphocytosis increase &gt; 50 % 2month period anticipate doubling time le 6 month . In patient initial blood lymphocyte count less 30x10^9/L LDT use single parameter define treatment indication . Marked hypogammaglobulinemia development monoclonal protein absence criterion active disease sufficient protocol therapy . Either follow : 18 year age old impaired performance status ( CIRS &gt; 6 ) /or 65 year age old performance status . Signed informed consent form . Intolerance exogenous protein know severe reaction administration Rituximab . Active infection . Cancer radiotherapy , biological therapy chemotherapy within 3 week prior Study Day 1 . TBC fungal infection within past 6 month even adequately control treatment . Severe organ deficiency prevent participation study .
