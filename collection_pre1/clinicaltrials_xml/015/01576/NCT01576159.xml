	<brief_title>Serum Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein Levels After 12 Weeks Different Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design A prospective , parallel-group randomize control trial design . Mustafa Kemal University ( MKU ) Ethical Board approve study ( B.30.2.MKU.0.01.01.00/255 ) . The exact nature study explain participant ask sign write consent . The test carry Middle East Technical University Medical Center , Ankara , Turkey January June 2008 . The independent variable group ( n=4 ) time ( n=2 ) . The dependent variable serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ) level measure three phase exercise : ( Recovery ) , immediately ( Fatigue ) , 30-min exercise ( Regeneration ) . Participants subject follow test prior end intervention period : body mass index ( BMI ) , isokinetic leg muscle strength , maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) serum COMP level . Participants 115 applicant volunteered take part study . Eligibility screening perform accord inclusion criterion . From 104 eligible applicant , 48 healthy , sedentary male university student age 18 25 year old ( Mage = 21.8±1.9 ) select simple drawing . However , study complete 44 participant , 4 dropout . Participants randomly assign 1:1:1:1 ratio parallel group , three exercise group ( swim , cycle run ) one control . In order random allocation , participant receive number unknown researcher write piece paper drawn box allow assign individual control exercise group . Baseline blood sample store -80°C analyze participant ' allocation . Exclusion criterion , survey questionnaire , : osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory joint disease , intra-articular steroid injection , mal-alignment knee ( varus/valgus ) large 15° , recent ( within six month ) fracture low extremity . Active athlete volunteer previous sport background include . During intervention period , one participant exclude study sudden kidney disease another one decide withdraw participation . In addition , two participant exclude study biochemical analysis since one subject run group n't meet minimum requirement 75 % exercise session attendance , one subject control group n't complete posttests . Descriptive data participant present . Interventions After first measurement , participant randomly equally assigned swimming , run , cycle control group . All exercise group participate session 40-min per day , three day per week , period 12 week . Each session begin five minute warm-up , continue main set 30-min exercise individual target heart rate zone ( 60-70 % heart rate reserve ) , finish five minute cool-down period . The individual target heart rate zone determine accord Guidelines Exercise Testing Prescription American College Sport Medicines [ 1 ] . Swimming exercise compose front crawl swim kick drill . During main set , participant perform front-crawl swim individual heart rate zone determine Karvonen formula [ 2 ] . Cyclers exercise 60-80 repetition per minute ( RPM ) ergometer ( Monark E 834 , Varberg , Sweden ) , adjust individual order maintain target heart rate zone . The run group participant exercise treadmill 1.5 % incline . The speed treadmill determine accord individual heart rate zone . Throughout 12 week training , Heart Rate Reserves ( HRR ) hold constant ( 60-70 % ) speed increase accord individual progression . Individuals control group instruct participate organize structured exercise 12 week intervention . Physical Physiological Measurements Body Mass Index calculate ratio body weight height square ( Heyward &amp; Stolarczyk 1996 ) . VO2max measure standard Bruce Protocol ( Bruce , Kusumi &amp; Hosmer 1973 ) Jager LE 200 CE ( Hochberg , Germany ) treadmill . Measurements perform VIASYS Healthcare ergospirometry line use MasterScreen CPX ( Wuerzburg , Germany ) device . Results present ml/kg/min ( milliliter oxygen per kilogram body weight per minute ) . Isokinetic quadriceps strength record Biodex System Dynamometer ( Biodex Medical Inc , Shirley , NY ) . Participants place comfortable position allow unrestricted motion knee 90 degree flexion terminal extension bicycle ergometer , ask warm-up five minute point stretch extremity . Before test trial , participant instruct perform maximum effort . Then five isokinetic concentric knee flexion extension 60°/sec dominant leg record . After , peak torque body weight ratio ( PT/BW ) measure . Blood Sampling Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) Procedures Blood obtain procedure modify Mundermann et al . [ 3 ] . Participants ask limit physical activity 48 hour prior experiment . On day experiment , participant make breakfast within one hour wake experiment start two three hour breakfast . In addition , participant seat chair 15-min immediately experiment . Five-milliliter blood sample obtain certify research nurse antecubital vein immediately , immediately , 0.5 hour 30-min walk exercise . During walk exercise test protocol , participant walk pace 5 km/h treadmill 1.5 % incline . After walk exercise , participant sit office chair 30-min ask rest . Blood sample collection storage procedure describe previously [ 4 ] . Venous blood sample obtain vena mediana cubitii . After clot 60 min room temperature , sample centrifuge 5000 rpm 10-min . The serum sample store -80°C analysis . Serum COMP concentration analyze commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay base two monoclonal antibody : COMP ELISA AnaMar Medical ( Sweden ) . ELISA analysis perform private institution assay procedure follow accord manufacturer 's guideline . The order blood sample mixed biochemist blind allocation sample . All blood sample analyze simultaneously maintain uniform specificity across individual . Statistical Procedures The effect 12 week intervention general fitness serum COMP concentration pre-tests post-tests analyze use 4x2 ( group time ) mixed repeat measure ANOVA variable . Paired-samples t-tests employ comparison serum COMP concentration rest , fatigue recovery state . In order decrease probability commit type-1 error , method multiple comparison Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment perform . Sample size calculation perform eliminate type II error . Sample size calculate use G*Power 3.1.3 ( Heinrich-Heine-University ) software [ 5 ] . Significance level set 0.05 medium effect size ( 0.25 ) two-sided calculation use . Effect size contains magnitude difference group value 0.25 , indicate medium effect treatment [ 6 ] . By assumption , achieve power 0.80 , sample size 36 participant necessary . Conservatively , 48 subject recruit since expect 20 % dropout rate due demand nature intervention program previous experience .</detailed_description>
