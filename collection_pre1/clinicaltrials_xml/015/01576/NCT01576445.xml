	<brief_summary>When perform total knee replacement surgery , surgeon choice type surgical technique use . The standard technique Royal Infirmary Edinburgh so-called 'medial parapatellar ' exposure . And alternative recently introduce technique 'Mid-vastus approach ' surgeon cut less muscle front leg . In study compare two surgical technique so-called randomized trial . This mean put people randomly two group , one group receive surgery 'Mid-vastus approach ' group surgery 'Medial parapatellar approach ' . It hypothesize people receive Mid-vastus approach recover quicker well short-term functional outcome people receive 'Medial parapatellar approach ' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Outcome Two Types Total Knee Replacement Surgery People With Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control double blind trial immediate post-operative recovery functional outcome 6 week , 3 6 month total knee replacement surgery assess two different type surgical approach ; Medial Parapatellar Mid-vastus . Functional outcome assess record kinematics low limb joint addition muscle activity ( electromyography ) walking , stair ascend descend get chair computerized 3D motion analysis . Outcome measure record immediate post surgery medium follow-up cover area World Health Organisation , International Components Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) component 'Body Structures Functions/Impairments ' , 'Activities Participation ' 'Personal factor ' . It hypothesize minimize damage quadriceps , patient operate use Mid-vastus approach well muscle function therefore normal knee range motion , knee joint load muscle activity pattern compare Medial Parapatellar approach .</detailed_description>
