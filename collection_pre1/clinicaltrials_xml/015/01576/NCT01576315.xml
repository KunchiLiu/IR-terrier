	<detailed_description>Aspergillus infection infectious complication frequently occur cystic fibrosis . The efficacy azole therapy patient cystic fibrosis persistent positive sputum Aspergillus still unknown . Furthermore , efficacy itraconazole voriconazole indication never evaluate large prospective control clinical trial , even though many team already use . The ATCF study prospective , multicenter , randomize , open-label , control phase II trial , perform patient cystic fibrosis persistent Aspergillus positive culture . The primary outcome ass efficacy itraconazole voriconazole course outcome negativisation sputum culture Aspergillus two consecutive culture . Secondary objective include effect azole therapy quality life , FEV1 , co-prescription antibiotic steroid , plasma concentration antifungal agent , speed negativisation sputum culture Aspergillus , outcome diagnostic criterion ( Aspergillus detection PCR , precipiting antibody , total specific IgE , eosinophilia ) , safety profile two product . Mycological failure , impact anti-fungal treatment lung systemic inflammation also assess .</detailed_description>
