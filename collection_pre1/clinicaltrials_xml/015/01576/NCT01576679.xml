	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Use Tissue Plasminogen Activator ( tPA ) Intra-Abdominal Collections Children - A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use tPA pediatric abdominal abscess poorly define . The indication somewhat subjective dosage guideline vary institution . Some study suggest administer , soon , time drainage ultrasound appearance collection complex and/or septated , initial aspirate content thick viscous . Both criterion difficult accurately define implement . In many instance , minimal ongoing drainage despite follow-up ultrasound appearance suggest significant residual collection , tPA administer several day follow initial procedure . The purpose study establish efficacy tPA initial treatment pediatric intra-abdominal abcesses standardize manner use . This may eventually lead change practice management patient population .</detailed_description>
