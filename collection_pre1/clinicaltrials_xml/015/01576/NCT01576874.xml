	<brief_title>The Gender-Sex Hormone Interface With Craving &amp; Stress-Related Changes Smoking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite considerable advance treatment development , cigarette smoking remain leading cause preventable death United States , smoker engage treatment unsuccessful quitting . The burden illness disproportionately borne female smoker , less responsive cessation intervention male . The relationship stress , craving , smoke behavior recognize key factor underlie gender difference nicotine dependence , must better understood characterized yield avenue intervention address critical health disparity . In prior ongoing SCOR study , research team demonstrate gender menstrual cycle/sex hormone influence reactivity laboratory-presented cue . Building laboratory finding , propose take two important next step : ( 1 ) evaluate experience crave `` real world '' natural environment female male smoker , ( 2 ) examine impact safe novel pharmacological intervention ( oxytocin ) stress reactivity female male smoker . If , hypothesize , gender , sex hormone , oxytocin administration influence relationship stress , craving , smoke behavior , finding could substantially address key gender-related health disparity . Such knowledge could also inform development gender-specific intervention enhance female smoker ' response cessation treatment . Therefore , knowledge gain propose study may yield significant public health benefit .</detailed_description>
