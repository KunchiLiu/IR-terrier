	<brief_summary>This study compare result clinically order abdominal CT angiography research non-contrast MR angiogram ( MRA ) . CTA `` gold-standard '' identify blockage kidney artery blood vessel problem . CTA require radiation contrast obtain useful image . Conversely , MR abdomen technique use study use radiation contrast felt safe option individual kidney problem . benefit establish non-contrast MRA clinically accurate test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Artery Contrast-Free Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REACT prospective , minimal-risk , multi-center international trial . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) diagnosis renal artery stenosis ( RAS ) . The current `` gold standard '' diagnose RAS non-invasive 3D angiography contrast-enhanced CTA/MRA invasive X-ray angiography . All technique require use intravenous injection either iodinate contrast material gadolinium base agent . Iodinated contrast agent contraindicate patient renal dysfunction increase risk allergic reaction . Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) gadolinium few risk associate , however , currently contraindicate patient severe renal insufficiency concern develop rare often fatal condition term nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) . Non-contrast MRA technique felt provide avenue safer , effective vascular imaging patient without kidney dysfunction . In trial propose validate contrast-free MRA technique , T-SLIP ( time-spatial labeling inversion pulse ) , diagnose RAS . This study compare T-SLIP reference standard contrast-enhanced CTA design test efficacy , reproducibility , reliability , safety .</detailed_description>
