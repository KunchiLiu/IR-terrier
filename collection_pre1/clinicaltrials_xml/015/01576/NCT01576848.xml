	<brief_summary>Rationale : Age relate muscle loss ( sarcopenia ) assume related impaired postprandial muscle protein synthetic response protein and/or amino acid administration elderly vs young . Co-ingestion carbohydrate increase post-prandial insulin secretion . Insulin affect skeletal muscle blood flow may therefore affect substrate availability postprandial muscle protein synthesis . However , unclear whether response combine intake protein carbohydrates different elderly compare young subject . Hypothesis : Adding carbohydrate bolus protein represent effective strategy overcome impaired postprandial muscle protein synthesis elderly . Objective : The primary objective study investigate whether carbohydrate co-ingestion augments vivo postprandial muscle protein synthetic response protein ingestion whether response different young elderly subject . The secondary objective study assess effect carbohydrate co-ingestion insulin level microvascular perfusion young elderly subject . Intervention : The intervention consist single test day subject receive drink contain 20 gram intrinsically label casein without 60 gram carbohydrate . In addition , continuous intravenous tracer infusion label amino acid administer . During test day 18 plasma sample 4 muscle biopsy collect period 8½ h. Furthermore , muscle skeletal blood flow estimate use sidestream darkfield imaging ( SDF ) sublingual position .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Carbohydrate Co-ingestion Post-prandial Anabolic Response Protein Young Elderly Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With human age , gradual progressive decline skeletal muscle tissue , also know sarcopenia . Sarcopenia accompany reduced physical performance , loss functional capacity , increase risk fall increase likelihood develop chronic metabolic disease , type 2 diabetes obesity . Eventually also result increase hospitalisation institutionalization elderly nursing home , high health care cost . Therefore , important investigate approach diminish loss skeletal muscle mass age . To preserve muscle mass , protein intake important , provide building block muscle tissue : amino acid . Since basal muscle protein synthesis rate seem differ young elderly , currently many research group focus postprandial muscle protein synthesis . Skeletal muscle protein synthesis show highly dependent protein intake . However , recent data indicate muscle protein synthetic response protein intake attenuate elderly . A blunt postprandial muscle protein synthetic response prolong period might result diminished muscle protein accretion could eventually contribute sarcopenia . The anabolic response protein intake appear mainly mediate elevation plasma essential amino acid . In addition , ingestion carbohydrate lead attenuation muscle protein breakdown virtue elevation plasma insulin , promote positive net protein balance . This mediate insulin 's know action increase muscle blood flow thereby augment muscle substrate delivery , may lead stimulation muscle protein synthesis . It show insulin resistance respect muscle protein anabolism elderly compare young subject condition high plasma amino acid insulin availability . This suggest reduced ability insulin augment muscle microvascular perfusion decrease amino acid stimulus . In present study investigator assess effect single meal-like amount intact protein without carbohydrate post-prandial muscle protein synthesis elderly ( 70-85 ) compare young ( 18 - 30 ) . Furthermore , investigator go investigate whether muscle protein synthetic response associate increase microvascular perfusion ingestion meal use Sidestream Dark Field ( SDF ) imaging . SDF measurement take de oral cavity underneath tongue , since area easily accessible representative microvascular perfusion . To able measure effect protein ingestion muscle protein synthesis investigator use intrinsically label casein . This allow u determine true incorporation amino acid ingest , intact casein muscle , take account influence digestion absorption process whole protein . Intrinsically label milk protein derive milk collect cow infuse L- [ 1-13C ] phenylalanine . The following hypothesis investigate : 1 . The combined intake protein carbohydrates augments post-prandial muscle protein synthesis elderly , young subject . 2 . The increased insulin production follow combined intake protein carbohydrates result increase microvascular perfusion relate post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response .</detailed_description>
