	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study abiraterone acetate prednisone together veliparib see well work compare abiraterone acetate prednisone alone treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread primary site place body . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antiandrogen drug , abiraterone acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving abiraterone acetate together prednisone veliparib may work good abiraterone acetate prednisone alone treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Prednisone With Without Veliparib Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate role v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene ( ETS ) gene fusion predictive biomarker response hormone therapy ( abiraterone [ abiraterone acetate ] ) alone hormone therapy plus poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase 1 ( PARP-1 ) target therapy ( ABT-888 [ veliparib ] ) patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . II . To evaluate whether addition PARP-1 target therapy superior hormone therapy alone base ETS gene fusion status . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Rate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline . II . Objective response rate . III . Progression-free survival . IV . Evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity abiraterone acetate without ABT-888 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine concordance fusion status among prostate cancer sample primary site , biopsied metastasis , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . II . To assess ETS fusion status CTCs , baseline , 12 week , disease progression ( study ) associate response therapy . III . To evaluate number CTCs , well expression level androgen receptor , RAD51 recombinase ( RAD51 ) , gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2aX ) foci CTCs baseline , 12 week , disease progression patient associate response therapy . IV . To determine role phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss predictive biomarker response abiraterone , alone combination ABT-888 . V. To determine role PARP1 activity predictive biomarker response abiraterone , alone combination ABT-888 . VI . To perform next-generation sequence discovery novel gene fusion prostate cancer negative ETS fusion . VII . To perform germline single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis gene involve hormone synthesis , transport , binding , metabolism , degradation discovery novel SNPs predictive response abiraterone , alone combination ABT-888 . VIII . To determine ETS fusion ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) level blood predictive response abiraterone , alone combination ABT-888 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) prednisone PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-28 . Patients also receive abiraterone acetate PO QD prednisone PO BID day 1 ( day 8 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
