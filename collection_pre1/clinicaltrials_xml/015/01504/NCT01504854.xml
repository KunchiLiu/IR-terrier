	<brief_summary>Resveratrol derive plant find high level red wine skin red grape . A recent study report monthly weekly consumption red wine associate low risk dementia . There compel evidence caloric restriction improve overall health activate class enzyme know Sirtuins . Resveratrol substance find plant directly activate sirtuins , mimic effect caloric restriction may affect regulatory pathway diseases age , include Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . In study , people AD give either Resveratrol placebo 12 month determine whether daily resveratrol therapy beneficial delay alter deterioration memory daily functioning . Subjects age 50 diagnosis probable AD may qualify participation study . A small group 15 participant ask take part detail 24-hour Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sub-study measure resveratrol level 24 hour period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct approximately 26 Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study ( ADCS ) clinical center . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) patient mild moderate dementia due probable Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) randomly assign treatment ( 1:1 ) resveratrol start 500 mg daily match placebo , increase 13 week interval maximum 1 gram twice daily ( divide two 500 mg capsule take orally ) take without food . Participants treat 52 week , undergo venous blood draw biomarker analysis Baseline 52 week ; participant also undergo two lumbar puncture biomarker analyse cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) Baseline Week 52 . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure rate whole-brain regional atrophy Screening , Week 13 Week 52 visit . Randomization stratify site . For monitor potential toxicity study drug - particularly nephrotoxicity - subject undergo physical examination , neurological examination , adverse event review , blood chemistry include blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) Creatinine ( Cr ) , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analyse resveratrol metabolite , urinalysis every 6-7 week study . Clinical , Cognitive Functional effect resveratrol insulin glucose metabolism also assess . A subgroup approximately 15 subject enrol randomized 4:1 ( N = 15 , 12 treat + 3 placebo ) detail 24-hour PK analysis . For individual , blood sample collect 15 different time point . Measurements include level resveratrol major metabolite ( sulfated- glucuronidated-resveratrol ) . These subject complete detailed PK dosage step . This 24-hour PK sample subgroup occur first dose follow Baseline , first dose dose increment ( Weeks 13 , 26 39 ) , final dose ( Week 52 ) . Enrollment restrict individual able abstain ingest large quantity resveratrol-containing food ( include red wine ) . 1-2 glass red wine red grape juice 1 serving red grape daily acceptable .
