	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis prevalent health concern among old adult associate increased risk fall cause fracture , injury even mortality . Identifying factor related fall occur within population essential development effective regime fall prevention . The long-term objective work ascertain mechanism effectively control balance senior osteoporosis provide basis develop fall prevention program . The entire body 's center mass ( CoM ) critical indicator balance control coordination among joint muscle control CoM still unclear . The aim1 study develop biomechanical model control entire body 's center mass ( CoM ) upright quiet stance senior osteoporosis . The aim2 study identify mechanism control entire body 's CoM receive balance perturbation senior osteoporosis . The finding research provide need information regard process balance control vulnerable osteoporosis population , potential applied individual neuromuscular orthopedic deficit .</brief_summary>
