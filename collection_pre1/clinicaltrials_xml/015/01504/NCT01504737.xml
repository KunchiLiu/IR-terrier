	<brief_summary>SURVEY OF THE FIELD Aortic stenosis ( AS ) common valve disease increase due grow elderly population . The therapy aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) . Studies postoperative rehabilitation AS pt scarce . In study available , mix valve disease present without consider difference pathophysiology training regimes clearly describe . PURPOSE , AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESIS The investigator purpose evaluate whether supervised cardiac rehabilitation program improve objective physical capacity quality life ( QoL ) patient AVR due AS , compare patient train . The investigator hypothesize supervised exercise training may efficient way rehabilitate patient . DESIGN This control randomized clinical trial compare 12 week supervise exercise training 3 time per week home-based training base upon public health recommendation minimum level physical activity .
