	<brief_summary>Background : The evaluation hypercortisolism include overnight 1mg dexamethasone ( DXM ) suppression test . An important shortcoming diagnostic specificity 80 % , likely due inter-individual difference gut absorption metabolism DXM . Study hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize serum-DXM measurement increase diagnostic accuracy overnight DXM-test work-up hypercortisolism . Aims : The primary aim prospective study evaluate serum-DXM measure simultaneously serum-cortisol morning sample could increase diagnostic accuracy diagnostic test . There several secondary aim . One estimate prevalence cause unusual DXM absorption metabolism . The investigator also evaluate feasibility diagnostic accuracy salivary DXM . Moreover , diagnostic accuracy midnight salivary cortisol cortisone , urinary cortisol , evaluate compare . Design : Levels DXM morning serum follow overnight DXM-test analyze patient evaluation hypercortisolism ( include incidentalomas ) . A cut-off level identify inadequate DXM concentration serum suppress endogenous cortisol production establish base negative test . This cut-off level apply retrospective analysis diagnostic accuracy DXM-tests . This prospective study blind design DXM measurement disclose end trial .</brief_summary>
