	<brief_summary>Development sarcoma within adjacent radiation field well know event poor prognosis unknown risk factor . Advanced technique radiation therapy include intensity modulate radiation therapy , tomotherapy Arc therapy provide new modality radiation delivery could responsible develop induced tumor . There little data molecular biology radiation induce sarcoma even tool still available characterize type tumor aim compare profile sarcoma observe non irradiated area . An update GETO-GCSF registry , currently call CONTICANET data base framework EORTC , represent backbone project . The next step follow two ax , clinical one base dosimetric analysis characteristic deliver radiation therapy second one base molecular characterization sarcoma develop irradiate field.The data base update organize CONTICANET network radiation oncologists involve treatment soft tissue sarcoma . A retrospective analysis clinical data parameter describe initial treatment register use methodology propose I. Diallo radiation induce tumor develop childhood . The recent data extract DICOM format intercomparison dedicate software.A centralize review pathological specimen plan validate correct classification tumor inside current stag system develop soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The biological study include two follow steps:1 . On frozen specimen : genic profile tumor study two different technique : CGH-array extracted DNA order evaluate number gene copy , amplification deletion . The RNAm expression profile study evaluate level gene expression . More 200 data collect Institut Bergonié , come de novo sarcoma would use comparative specimen since pathological diagnosis one observe radiation induce sarcoma . A comparison two population able define profile , gene modification signalisation pathway radiation induce sarcoma . 2 . On blood sample : 2 group patient compare : radiation induce sarcoma patient receive radiation therapy 5 year ago without develop sarcoma . The study perform inform consent patient control cases.This second step require 2 blood sample ( 2 x 5 ml ) . They collect send molecular biology laboratory locate Centre Alexis VAUTRIN ( Nancy ) .- One sample 5 mm dedicate study radiation induce apoptosis assess flow cytometry . A correlation describe radiation-induced apoptosis CT8+ lymphocytes 8 Gy irradiation occurrence severe late toxicity radiation therapy patient treat several type tumors.- The second sample use study polymorphism gene involve reparation DNA use chip screen single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) . This sample use DNA extraction mononuclear blood cell . DNA extract control flow cytometrical separation . It send Bordeaux molecular biology laboratory Institut Bergonié ( Prof. JM COINDRE ) perform evaluation single nucleotide polymorphism . The aim part protocol study variance gene , product play role radiation response development adverse effect radiation therapy . For patient radiation-induced sarcoma , result analysis compare data obtain DNA analysis extract tumor . The clinical , pathological biological characterisation radiation-induced sarcoma obtain allow identify constitutional variance link increased sensitivity radiation therapy lead discuss indication irradiation population risk . Pediatric radiation therapy adjuvant treatment surgery breast carcinoma main target selection patient . This project able select radiation modality patient risk ( intensity modulate radiation therapy 3D conformal approach , stereotactic approach , partial irradiation breast ) .</detailed_description>
