	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Tolerability Etravirine HIV-1 Infected Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use NNRTI-based regimen initial therapy HIV-infected child increase , especially area newborn expose HIV-1 receive single-dose nevirapine ( NVP ) part prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) regimens and/or daily NVP prevention transmission breastfeed . First-generation NNRTIs low genetic barrier development resistance ; two widely use NNRTIs , NVP efavirenz ( EFV ) , even single amino acid mutation virus lead reduction drug 's effectiveness . Even short-term use NNRTIs , include single dose NVP , cause NNRTI resistance . Second-generation NNRTIs need part ARV regimens newly diagnose infant child expose single-dose NVP fail current antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens . In study , second-generation NNRTI ETR test safety , tolerability , appropriate dosing . Children assign one three cohort base age : - Cohort I : At least 2 young 6 year age - Cohort II : At least 1 young 2 year age - Cohort III : At least 2 month less 1 year age Children cohorts treatment experience , define fail combination ARV regimen ( contain least 3 ARVs ) least 8 week treatment interruption least 4 week history virologic failure combination ARV regimen ( contain least 3 ARVs ) . Children receive ETR together optimize background regimen ( OBR ) consist least 2 active agent ( boosted protease inhibitor [ PI ] least 1 additional active ARV drug ) . OBR base clinical status , treatment history , resistance data , availability appropriate pediatric dosing formulation . Some ARVs use part OBR may provide study . The child receive oral dose ETR twice daily . Most child 11 visit : screening , entry ( Day 0 ) , Day 14 ( intensive pharmacokinetic [ PK ] visit ) , Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Most visit include physical exam , give medical history , discussion adherence , blood urine collection . The screen intensive PK visit also include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . During intensive PK visit , child blood drawn approximately 7 time 12 hour . After Week 48 visit , child enter long-term follow-up phase study visit every 12 week 5 year . These follow-up visit include give medical history undergoing physical exam blood draw .</detailed_description>
