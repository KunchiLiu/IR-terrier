	<brief_summary>This study enroll patient locally advanced metastatic non-EGFR mutate Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) lung cancer failure least one two prior approve treatment regimen . Patients randomize receive one two dos vaccine placebo dose twice weekly 18 week ( 36 dos total ) patient also receive erlotinib 150mg take orally daily duration trial . The study examine immune effect , safety efficacy two different dos HS110 vaccine combination erlotinib versus erlotinib alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response Safety HS110 Vaccine Combination With Erlotinib Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study enroll patient advance NSCLC ( squamous cell non-squamous cell ) without EGFR mutation ( either L858R 746-750 deletion ) progression recurrence disease follow least one two prior regimen ( adjuvant therapy exclude ) approve therapy include immunomodulating anti-EGFR targeted therapy disease . EFGR status must know time enrollment either via prior determination test perform archival tissue screen process . Patients resectable disease eligible resection defer first six week vaccine . Patients receive twice weekly dose vaccine ( spatially divide 5 intradermal injection ) 18 week ( 36 total dos ) . Patients randomize 2:1 fashion ; 30 patient HS110 treatment group ( high low dose ) 15 patient receive placebo injection . Patients also receive erlotinib 150mg daily duration trial . A total 75 patient enrolled trial . The study include lead-in phase 9 patient ( 3 dose group ) observe weekly 4 week assess safety combine HS110 erlotinib . Treatment first 4 patient stagger 2 week interval allow safety evaluation treat additional patient . If combination prove safe well-tolerated first 9 patient , enrollment open predetermined sample size arm . A Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) use study independently monitor adverse event progression/survival data . The DMC meet completion run-in period half patient dose week 6 week 12 .</detailed_description>
