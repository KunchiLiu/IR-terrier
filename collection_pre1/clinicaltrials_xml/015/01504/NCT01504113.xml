	<detailed_description>Introduction As numerous study identify TNF-α , TH-17 IL-17 particularly major role govern inflammatory cascade psoriasis , target therapy , include TNF-α TH-17 antagonist , represent major breakthrough treatment psoriasis . It well know TNF-α play important role immune response viral infection , attribute direct inhibition viral replication , kill virally infect cell , induction FasL-dependent CD8+ T-lymphocyte effector pathway TNF/TNF receptor 2 interaction promote inflammatory response indirectly.Additionally , show treatment TNF-α antagonist associate increased viral replication virus-inoculated rat , progressive loss CD4+ CD8+ T cell decrease level TNF-α interferon . A transient decrease T cell responsiveness also observe patient treated TNF-α antagonists.10 TNF-α inhibit CMV production certain cell type CMV major immediate early promoter inhibit TNF-α . Increased TNF production report CMV infection , also display anti-CMV activity vitro . TNF-α also involve direct control HPV infection induction apoptosis HPV-infected cell , arrest growth HPV-infected keratinocytes down-regulation HPV-gene transcription , stimulation inflammatory response up-regulation HLA class I components antigen-presenting cell . E6 protein HPV-16 know directly bind TNF receptor 1 abrogate TNF-induced apoptosis host cell . Recent study show high prevalence HPV DNA psoriatic skin increase HPV5 antibody patient psoriasis . It seem psoriatic skin may specifically permissive HPV . Increased pap smear abnormality observe patient inflammatory bowel disease receive TNF-α antagonist . However , specific effect anti-TNF therapy HPV carriage HPV-associated disease remain unknown . Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) associate several B-cell epithelial-cell malignancy , especially patient immunosuppressive treatment . Increased risk lymphoproliferative disorder patient treat TNF-α antagonist address . Case report EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease regress withdrawal anti-TNF-α drug also describe . Thus , concern increase risk least part cause immunosuppression anti-TNF therapy , may cause consecutive EBV reactivation , emerge proven yet . Anti-TNF-α drug , include monoclonal antibody TNF-α ( infliximab adalimumab ) soluble TNF receptor ( etanercept ) , recognize risk factor opportunistic infection . A recent study demonstrate high risk opportunistic infection patient receive adalimumab etanercept , 10- 17-fold difference risk . However , knowledge latent viral reactivation anti-TNF treatment come study patient inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis . Moreover , study mainly focus herpesviruses viral hepatitis . Several case report EBV , CMV , HPV infection complicate therapy TNF-α antagonist patient psoriasis also report . IL-17 proinflammatory cytokine produce variety cell , include newly identify subset activate CD4+ T cell ( Th17 cell ) , γδT cell , CD8+ cell NKT cell . There evidence support protective role IL-17 host defense extracellular bacterial infection , include Klebsiella pneumonia,38 Bacteroides fragilis Escherichia coli . A recent study also show IL-17 essential human immunity common fungus Candida albicans . Various bacteria fungi report associated provocation and/or exacerbation psoriasis . The strong evidence exist induction guttate psoriasis precede tonsilar Streptococcus pyogenes infection . Balci et al also find significant high rate Staphylococcus aureus colonization lesional skin naris patient psoriasis healthy control . They also suggest significant relationship PASI score S. aureus cultivation toxin production lesional skin patient psoriasis . However , study investigate impact TNF-α , TH-17 , IL-17 antagonist target agent patient psoriasis limit . Aim： In Taiwan , seropositive rate CMV approximately 50 % school age child 90 % adult . EBV cause persistent infection B lymphocytes 90 % adult population worldwide.46 Thus , importance investigate influence target therapy latent virus microorganism ca n't overemphasize . The aim study prospectively investigate effect TNF-α , TH-17 IL-17 antagonists administration activation virus , include CMV , EBV HPV impact biologics prevalence surface colonization microorganism , include HPV , bacteria fungi , patient psoriasis .
