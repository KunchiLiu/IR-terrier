	<brief_summary>This study patient advance solid tumor . The purpose study test safety effectiveness new combination drug , CS-7017 Bexarotene patient advance cancer . CS-7017 Bexarotene many effect cancer cell , include stop cancer cell grow dividing , cause cancer cell die . CS-7017 Bexarotene work cancer cell similar manner drug together may even great effect cancer cell , hopefully , increase kill cancer cell . CS-7017 investigational experimental anti-cancer agent yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use type cancer . Bexarotene anti-cancer agent approve FDA patient specific type cancer , cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . This study help find effect combination drug , CS-7017 Bexarotene , cancer . This research do know CS-7017 safe give Bexarotene .</brief_summary>
