	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn feasible give beta-blocker Inderal ( propranolol hydrochloride ) standard chemotherapy ( paclitaxel carboplatin possibly docetaxel ) treat ovarian cancer . The safety propranolol hydrochloride also study . Propranolol hydrochloride design block certain chemical affect heart . Researchers want learn might also boost immune system , allow chemotherapy effective . Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tests Before Treatment : If find eligible take part study , follow test procedure perform begin treatment . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) . - Your medical history record , include drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 5 ½ teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . Biomarkers find blood may relate reaction study drug . - You electrocardiogram ( ECG ) check heart function . - You ask fill several questionnaire feel , life affect disease , age , education , marital status . These questionnaire take 30-40 minute complete . Study Drug Administration Before Treatment : You take propranolol mouth 2 time day 48-72 hour treatment . You take glass water ( 8 ounce ) . If concern start medication , meet heart doctor treatment . You stop take propranolol last dose give night surgery . Tests During Surgery : During surgery , doctor think enough tissue available without affect amount tissue need make diagnosis , leftover tumor tissue surgery use biomarker immune system test . Once doctor know final diagnosis pelvic mass , he/she able tell treatment need still eligible continue take part study . You take study pathology report show sign cancer need receive chemotherapy . Study Drug Administration : After surgery , able tolerate drug take mouth , restart take propranolol mouth 2 time day every day . You begin chemotherapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel docetaxel ) either 3 week surgery . The doctor decide receive chemotherapy schedule drug base best interest . You receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour follow carboplatin vein 1 hour . You receive total 6 cycle chemotherapy . If doctor think best interest , may receive docetaxel vein 1 hour instead paclitaxel . If 3-week schedule , receive paclitaxel docetaxel follow carboplatin Day 1 3-week cycle . If weekly schedule , receive paclitaxel follow carboplatin Day 1 cycle . On Days 8 15 receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour . If doctor think need , start chemotherapy surgery . You 3 cycle chemotherapy surgery 3 cycle surgery . Study Visits After Surgery : On Day 1 cycle : - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) draw CA-125 testing . After Cycles 3 6 chemotherapy : - Any updates medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test CA-125 testing . - Blood ( 5 ½ teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . If chemotherapy surgery , Cycle 3 blood draw surgery . - You fill study questionnaire feel life affect disease . - You ECG doctor think need . - After 6th cycle , CT scan abdomen pelvis check status disease doctor think need . Length Dosing : You may continue take propranolol hydrochloride end Cycle 6 chemotherapy . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-up Visits : About every 3 month 1 year stop taking study drug , follow standard tests/procedures perform : - Any updates medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test CA-125 testing . - You ECG doctor think need . - You CT scan abdomen pelvis check status disease doctor think need . Information health treatment collect medical record receive follow-up MD Anderson keep part study record . This information include past medical history , information physical exam , diagnosis pathology ( tissue ) report , result routine blood test , current drug take , follow-up information treatment , side effect , health . This investigational study . Propranolol hydrochloride commercially available FDA approve treat high blood pressure , irregular heartbeat , protect heart heart attack . Giving patient ovarian cancer investigational . Up 25 patient take part study . Up 20 enrol MD Anderson . Up 5 enrolled Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
