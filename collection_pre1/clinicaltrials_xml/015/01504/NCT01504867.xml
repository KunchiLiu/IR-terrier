	<brief_title>LIPS-A : Lung Injury Prevention Study With Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) remain life-threatening critical care syndrome characterize alveolar-capillary membrane injury hypoxemic respiratory failure . The median time onset ARDS 2 day hospital presentation . Therefore , period hospital presentation development ARDS present brief window opportunity ARDS prevention . This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , Phase 2b , randomize clinical trial . Development ARDS define Berlin criterion ( modify require invasive mechanical ventilation ) within 7 day hospital admission . The first dose study drug placebo administer within 24 hour presentation hospital . Important co-interventions standardize across site use web-based tool , Checklist Lung Injury Prevention . Study participant screen daily receipt mechanical ventilation determination partial pressure arterial oxygen ( PaO2 ) oxygen saturation fraction inspire oxygen ratio ( SpO2 : FIO2 ) . If participant 's SpO2 : FIO2 ratio consistently 315 , hypoxemia confirm measurement arterial blood gas . Chest radiograph intubate patient SpO2 : FIO2 300 less independently review site investigator member trial 's executive committee . Study participant die discharged hospital day 7 without meet criterion ARDS adjudicate ARDS .</detailed_description>
