	<brief_summary>Patients low blood count ( anemia ) stable unstable coronary artery disease consistently show bad clinical outcome . It unclear whether association confound since anemic patient tend also sicker i.e . low ejection fraction comorbidities would reason worse outcome rather anemia . The coronary artery unique vascular bed insofar across cardiac circulation oxygen extraction close maximal rest . Thus increase demand meet increase blood flow hemoglobin concentration since oxygen extraction maximal rest . It natural assume maximization oxygen delivery set active coronary syndrome ( ACS ) beneficial patient since oxygen extraction coronary blood flow fix . In fact , intensive care unit patient ACS transfuse HCT 30 % . However , retrospective analysis trial data show best mixed result clinical outcome patient ACS transfuse fact study show consistently bad outcomes non-transfused patient . Similar disappointing result recently publish patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . This study design determine effect red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion oxygen consumption , cardiac , microcirculatory endothelial function patient active coronary artery disease . For study active coronary artery disease define patient undergone within past 4 day recruitment either myocardial infarction due atherothrombosis ( AHA type I myocardial infarction ) surgery coronary artery bypass grafting . In specific study test hypothesis whether RBC transfusion improve cardiac vascular function patient hematocrit less 30 % active coronary artery disease . Aims study determine whether RBC transfusion patient active coronary artery disease anemia : - increase oxygen delivery peripheral tissue . - increase whole-body oxygen consumption . - decrease nitric oxide bioavailability , endothelial , microcirculatory , myocardial function , and/or increase platelet aggregation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adverse clinical outcome reduce critically ill patient transfuse hematocrit drop 21 % : Hematocrit ( HCT ) measure severity anemia . A HCT consider normal range 38 48 % total blood volume . In critically ill patient anemia common ; 95 % patient admit intensive care unit hemoglobin level normal intensive care unit ( ICU ) day 3 . { Corwin , 1995 # 8809 ; Rodriguez , 2001 # 8810 } The transfusion trigger `` 30/10 '' ( HCT &lt; 30 % , hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl ) suggest case series trauma patient early 1942 . { Adam , 1942 # 8811 } Since trigger largely matter faith , without prospective data support improvement clinical outcome . Several clinical trial conduct past two decade show least equivalence clinical outcome conservative transfusion trigger hemoglobin 7-9 g/dL apply critically-ill patient population . { Hebert , 1999 # 8812 ; Vincent , 2002 # 8814 ; Corwin , 2004 # 8813 } The transfusion trigger patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) recent coronary artery bypass graft subset critically ill patient controversial , intensive care unit liberal approach transfusion patient typically choose . { Gerber , 2008 # 8815 } However , efficacy RBC transfusion appear significantly limit empirically assumed patient active coronary artery disease . The TRICC investigator perform subset analysis independent study patient cohort critically-ill patient cardiovascular disease . { Hebert , 1997 # 8835 } They find transfusion hemoglobin trigger 7 g/dL safe . Furthermore , great end-organ dysfunction record patient liberal transfusion trigger , overall mortality similar study cohort time interval ( intensive care unit , course hospital stay , 30-d 60-d follow-up ) . { Hebert , 1999 # 8812 } ACS patient receive transfusion HCT le 24 % : Several retrospective study show general , transfusion RBC patient ACS hematocrit &gt; 24 % neutral slightly beneficial cause harm HCT &gt; 30 % . { Rao , 2004 # 8836 ; Yang , 2005 # 8837 ; Sabatine , 2005 # 8827 ; Singla , 2007 # 8838 ; Singla , 2007 # 8838 } Such small ( ) benefit intuitive , light increase arterial oxygen content PRBC transfusion therefore decrease cardiac output oxygen consumption . Two beneficial effect patient active coronary artery disease . Indeed , increase arterial oxygen content transfusion may either 1 ) increase oxygen delivery myocardium distal anatomic coronary stenosis 2 ) deleterious biological effect cardiovascular system . Despite result RBC transfusion unstable coronary artery disease little beneficial effect , clinician ( standard care ) transfuse patient ACS HCT 30 % regardless potential adverse side effect RBC transfusion . The guideline transfusion practice BIDMC instance differentiate hemodynamically stable bleeding patient . The HCT bleeding patient great 30 % . In hemodynamically stable patient differentiate patient without sign end-organ ischemia . In patient without end-organ ischemia HCT 21 % tolerated patient end-organ ischemia active coronary artery disease HCT &gt; 30 % . Storage RBC transfusion lower function RBCs : In retrospective study patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) recent study find RBC transfusion associate increase risk mortality short term long term postoperative complication patient transfuse store RBCs ( old 14 day ) . This association remain significant even control assumption patient receive blood transfusion general sicker therefore prone complication . { Koch , 2008 # 8847 } Since introduction acid-citrate-dextrose preservative possible store blood several week currently 42 day . The criterion decision blood storage long base arbitrarily red blood cell survival recipient 24 hour great 70 % . { Mollison , 1942 # 8848 } In past decade however establish transfused surviving red blood cell exhibit quite different physiologic property compare native RBCs . This phenomenon call storage lesion . There rapid depletion 2,3 diglycerophosphate ( 2,3-DPG ) storage . { Bunn , 1968 # 8849 } This profound impact hemoglobin affinity reduce oxygen release hemoglobin much 25 % similar change oxygen saturation . Of note within 72h 50 % 2,3-DPG restore transfused RBCs . Moreover , mark decrease adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , reduce deformability transfuse RBCs ability RBCs navigate microcirculation . { Dern , 1967 # 8850 } Infusion store RBCs cause hemolysis turn reduces nitric oxide bioavailability : Significant hemolysis ( condition RBC burst content RBC leak outside ; particular free hemoglobin ) occur storage particular transfusion . { Sowemimo-Coker , 2002 # 8851 } Free hemoglobin outside RBCs scavenges nitric oxide . Nitric oxide ( NO ) colorless gas , produce inner lining vessel ( endothelium ) . It act D5W lubricant vessel . It keep blood vessel open `` lubricates '' blood cell flow blood vessel easily . A decrease nitric oxide bioavailability cause vasoconstriction increase RBC adhesion endothelium turn decrease microcirculatory flow . { Reiter , 2002 # 6096 } RBCs also contain arginase release circulation enhance nitric oxide depletion reduce precursor arginine . { Kato , 2005 # 7955 } The investigator systematically examine effect RBC transfusion systemic oxygen delivery , whole body oxygen consumption , nitric oxide bioavailability , endothelial function , cardiac performance , microcirculatory function , platelet aggregation patient active coronary artery disease , present BIDMC anemia , define hematocrit &lt; 30 % . This test hypothesis depletion nitric oxide pool transfusion-associated hemolysis cause decrease microcirculation , endothelial , platelet function . To best knowledge study date explore physiologic effect RBC transfusion patient active coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
