	<detailed_description>Patients assign intervention control group ( 1:1 ratio ) research nurse base computer-generated allocation sequence . Stratified randomization perform allocate equal number patient without diabetes group . This open trial without mask participant investigator . Outcome measure blind . Patients meet inclusion criterion ask participate study . After informed consent give , patient see nurse practitioner doctor ( coordinator study ) intake . During intake patient inform study , medical history take , questionnaires complete physical examination perform BP measurement laboratory test perform . The patient also receive information hypertension personal lifestyle advises intake . After inclusion , patient randomize two group : 1 . Control group : After intake patient receive usual care outpatient clinic . After one year coordinator study nurse practitioner see control group patient final evaluation . During evaluation , questionnaire , measurement laboratory test repeat . 2 . Intervention group : After intake , patient receive HBP-monitor login account personal website . Furthermore , instruction use home blood pressure monitor website give . The web-based program use patient upload blood pressure reading communicate nurse practitioner doctor vice versa . Patients ask question daily receive personal lifestyle advice monthly basis . If need , medication adjustment make base blood pressure measurement . Online information provide patient reference work information hypertension , treatment strategy technical fact blood pressure monitor website . Patients intervention group visit physician OPD 6 month , instead every 3 month . If necessary patient visit physician earlier . If patient multiple disease , regular visit internal medicine department restrict . After 12 month , patient intervention control group see final evaluation . Data register intake : - Hypertension history - Duration severity hypertension - Drugs use , efficacy adverse effect - Indications secondary hypertension : - Family history renal disease ( polycystic kidney ) - Renal disease , urinary tract infection , heamaturia , analgesic abuse - Drug/substance intake : oral contraceptive , liquorice , carbenoloxone , nasal drop , cocaine , amphetamine , steroid - Episodes sweat , headache , anxiety , palpitation ( pheaochromocytoma ) - Episodes muscle weakness tetany ( hyperaldosteronism ) - Signs organ damage - Brain eye : headache , vertigo , impaired vision , transient ischemic attack , sensory motor deficit - Heart : palpitation , chest pain , shortness breath , swollen ankle - Kidney : thirst , polyuria , nocturia , heamaturia - Peripheral artery : cold extremity , intermittent claudication - Family history premature cardiovascular disease ( M : &lt; 55 year , W : &lt; 65 year ) - ECG - Level education Data register intake 12 month : - Associated clinical condition : Diabetes Mellitus , Cerebrovascular disease , Heart disease , Renal disease , Peripheral vascular disease , Advanced retinopathy - Medication - Quality life : This assess SF-12 Health Survey - Physical examination : - Height weight , BMI - Waist circumference - Blood pressure : This measure 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor office blood pressure ( OBP ) measurement . - Signs secondary hypertension - Signs organ damage - Lifestyle habit : - Physical activity : The level physical activity measure short version International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) [ 19 ] . - Diet : Saturated fat intake Fruit Vegetable intake measure two validated Dutch Questionnaires [ 20 , 21 ] . Salt intake measure 24-hour urine analysis . - Alcohol consumption : Respondents ask much glass alcohol drink per week average . - Smoking : Smoking status assess ask respondent current smoker ( smoke , much smoke , intention quit smoking ) , ex-smoker ( many pack year never-smoked ) . - Quality life : This measure SF-12-health survey - Laboratory test : - Total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , Triglycerides ( fast ) - Glucose ( fast ) , Insulin , HbA1C - Creatinine , potassium - Haemoglobin , haematocrit - Uric acid , calcium - Thyroid-stimulating hormone - Microalbuminuria / proteinuria ( 24-hour urine collection ) Measurement procedure : In group 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement perform start study 12 month . After start study , intervention group measure blood pressure use `` Microlife WatchBP '' Home blood pressure monitor inflatable cuff upper arm . This meter approve Dutch Heart Foundation [ 18 ] . The measurement automatically transfer secure website ( http : //www.bpathome.com/main/ageneral.html ) meter connect computer use USB-portal . This website approach caregiver patient . Patients instructed measure accord European Society Hypertension ( ESH ) guideline blood pressure monitoring home . During HBP measurement follow recommendation make : - The arm must support ( table ) - The arm position heart level - All measurement perform arm ( arm high blood pressure intake ) - During intake size inflatable bladder determine ( length inflatable bladder cover 80-100 % arm circumference , width half length ) - The centre bladder place brachial artery . The intervention group measure BP accord guideline blood pressure monitoring home : - HBP monitor 7 day stretch every month two morning two evening measurement . The average value use clinical decision making , exception first day , discard . Diagnostic therapeutic threshold : Cut-off limit conventional blood pressure measure applicable HBPM , therefore different cut-off limit use . Hypertension diagnose HBPM start BP level 135/85 mmHg patient without diabetes 130/75 mmHg patient Diabetes . The target HBP therapy threshold . For OBP , hypertension diagnose BP level 140/90 mmHg patient without diabetes 130/80 mmHg patient diabetes , target OBP threshold . Safety limit set reading great 200/100 mmHg systolic BP le 80 mmHg , trigger alert system . Pharmacological therapy : All patient enrol study continue current blood pressure medication . The medication dose adjustment patient randomized intervention group do monthly nurse practitioner coordinate physician base HBP measurement . Patients study group communicate coordinate doctor secure website . Medication adjustment make physician communicate web-based system telephone . Medication adjustment make base European guideline . When necessary doctor coordinate study consult senior physician discus medication change . These patient see physician 6 month inclusion , provide patient hypertension . If patient multiple disease , regular visit restrict . The head outpatients clinic supervise coordinate doctor study . Patients randomize non-intervention group receive usual care specialist make necessary medication adjustment , visit outpatient clinic hospitalization . Lifestyle intervention : Patients intervention group receive general personal lifestyle-advices every month patient question lifestyle . Multiple aspect take account : - Smoking cessation : For counsel help smoking cessation , guideline Dutch expert centre tobacco control 'STIVORO ' follow . - Moderation alcohol consumption : Advice alcohol consumption base national guideline acceptable alcohol consumption binge drinking . Women advise drink one consumption day men advise drink 2 consumption day . Furthermore risk associate binge-drinking explain . - Regular physical activity : Patients advise put together least 30 minute moderate-intensity physical activity least five day week , accord guideline healthy physical activity primary care . Moderate intense exercise include example : walking , cycling , gardening , swim dance . - Reduction high salt fat intake : Patients advise consume 6 gram salt day . Furthermore total daily intake fat aim less 30 % total daily energy intake saturate fatty acid le 10 % total daily energy intake . Dietary intervention base national guideline healthy diet .</detailed_description>
