	<detailed_description>Treatments ALD limit success drinking continue . Cessation alcohol consumption significant reduction alcohol intake improves histology survival patient stage ALD . While alcohol abstinence may sufficient provide total recovery ALD , patient uncomplicated ALD 5-year survival almost 90 % stop drinking . Consequently , abstinence important therapeutic intervention patient ALD . When combine psychosocial treatment , currently approve medication improve outcome AD individual ; however , treatment unsuccessful many others . One limit factor must take consideration use currently approve medication disulfiram naltrexone liver function . Given hepatic metabolism , disulfiram naltrexone increase risk hepatotoxicity AD individual . Therefore , pharmacotherapy effective AD , safe liver able recover alcohol-related liver damage thereby improve liver function , would ideal medication . However , drug find provide benefit AD individual . It propose therefore test metadoxine ( MTDX ) hypothesize significantly beneficial treatment alcoholism ALD . Metadoxine currently approve Europe acute chronic alcohol intoxication never test US . Furthermore , MTDX use Europe treat ALD . Preliminary evidence show MTDX reduce alcohol consumption AD individual .
