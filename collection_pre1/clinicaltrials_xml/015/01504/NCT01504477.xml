	<brief_summary>This study patient colon cancer fully remove surgery come back responded standard chemotherapy treatment . Subjects enrol either first part study ( Phase I ) second part study ( Phase II ) . Phase I complete Phase II start . The purpose Phase I part find high dose bortezomib give panitumumab without cause severe side effect . The purpose Phase II part test effect two drug subject colorectal cancer . Panitumumab drug target protein important growth cancer cell know EGFR . By block activity protein , panitumumab block cancer cell growth even lead death . Panitumumab give intravenously every two week . Panitumumab approve FDA patient colorectal cancer . Bortezomib drug target part cancer cell know proteosome . By inhibit proteosome , bortezomib inhibit cancer cell growth even lead death . Bortezomib give intravenously , week , 3 every 4 week . Bortezomib FDA approve treatment colorectal cancer . As part study investigator take biopsy patient ' tumor treatment , start panitumumab alone , receive panitumumab bortezomib . The investigator want investigate marker inside tumor may relate well two medication work . These biopsy require part study .</brief_summary>
