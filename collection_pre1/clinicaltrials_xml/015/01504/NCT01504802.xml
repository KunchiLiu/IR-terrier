	<brief_summary>It widespread practice treat child short stature growth hormone . However , individual child respond growth hormone treatment unpredictable highly variable . Some child respond growth hormone treatment . Currently , way determine well growth hormone therapy work wait treat six month compare pre-treatment growth velocity growth velocity treatment . It would helpful blood test could do shortly start growth hormone could predict whether well child respond treatment . Such blood test would allow endocrinologist adjust growth hormone dose ( possibly stop altogether , work ) long six month currently take . C-type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) partner amino-terminal propeptide CNP ( NTproCNP ) proteins play critical role regulate growth . The investigator previously show blood level proteins increase child treat growth hormone . The investigator believe blood test proteins useful predict child 's response growth hormone treatment . The purpose study determine start growth hormone , blood level CNP NTproCNP start increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment child short stature recombinant human growth hormone widespread practice . However , growth response growth hormone treatment highly variable , particularly child classic growth hormone deficiency . The availability biomarker efficacy measure early treatment would beneficial . C-type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) play critical role linear growth . CNP produce growth plate signal paracrine mechanism . Its bioinactive amino-terminal propeptide ( NTproCNP ) easily measurable plasma level reflect rate CNP biosynthesis . Previous study lamb child show plasma concentration NTproCNP correlate linear growth velocity investigator also show level increase growth hormone therapy . The investigator propose NTproCNP biomarker linear growth consider first `` growth plate function test . '' Such growth biomarker likely reflect efficacy growth hormone therapy soon start growth hormone , possibly soon day . Before clinical utility determine , investigator need ascertain pharmacodynamics CNP NTproCNP response growth hormone . The goal study describe pharmacodynamics CNP response initiation growth hormone two set child short stature , growth hormone deficiency normal growth hormone secretion ( idiopathic short stature ) compare data pharmacodynamics peptide previously identify potential biomarkers . The investigator hypothesize plasma NTproCNP level increase within four day start growth hormone therapy response child growth hormone deficiency prompt great idiopathic short stature . The investigator second hypothesis increase NTproCNP response growth hormone correlate increase growth velocity six twelve month treatment . The study prospective observational study child growth hormone deficiency ( n=10 ) idiopathic short stature ( n=10 ) start rhGH therapy . The study consist frequent monitor analyte level one year treatment . This two site study , Nemours Children 's Clinic , Jacksonville , Florida Children 's Hospital Los Angeles .</detailed_description>
