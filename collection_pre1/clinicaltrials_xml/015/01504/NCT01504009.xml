	<brief_summary>Patients neuropathic disease experience increase muscle weakness , loss muscle strength functional ability illness . In healthy people , regular exercise best way maintain improve muscle strength , endurance general health status thereby maintain function ability . Previously , patient neuromuscular disease advise avoid kind physical exercise . However , lately number study evaluate effect training patient neuromuscular disease , positive effect functional ability find . Based finding want investigate mechanism lead development muscle atrophy loss functional ability , explore opportunity reduce muscle waste thereby improve course disease development strength training . The main objective investigate effect strength train slow disease progression reduce decline muscle strength function patient amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . In addition , aim carry detailed study biological process muscle tissue order unveil mechanism lead muscle atrophy , examine effect strength training program . The goal able incorporate strength training treatment program patient order maintain muscle strength function individual long possible . Minimum 10 patient disease include study . Through 12 week period patient participate strength training 2-3 time per week . Muscles biopsies take ( ) 12 week commencement strength training program , ( ii ) begin training ( iii ) 12 week strength training . Patients function control . Blood sample collect simultaneously order follow development strength training . Furthermore , participant assess number functional test questionnaire evaluate strength , balance social/ psychological status . Subjects recruit association Odense University Hospital . In present study , participant become part social network , participate organize training session , thus possibility make contact ALS patient situation .</brief_summary>
