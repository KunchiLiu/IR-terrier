	<brief_title>Freeze-Dried Black Raspberries Preventing Oral Cancer Recurrence High-Risk Appalachian Patients Previously Treated With Surgery For Oral Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct initial clinical study utilize high risk underserved Appalachian population former oral cancer patient determine practicability long-term daily lyophilize black raspberry ( LBR ) ( LBR lozenge ) administration gain insight potential prevention recurrent oral cancer LBR . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate numerous parameter ( recruitment , tolerability , adherence study guideline , collection biological sample , demographic ) helpful design future definitive , randomize , Phase II III clinical trial structure assess potential effect long-term LBR administration . II . Evaluate temporal modulation LBR-responsive gene expression favor oral cancer chemoprevention `` risk '' normal tissue , LBR administration . III . Assess temporal modulation LBR-responsive gene expression biological level fruit component post-surgical oral cancer patient expose LBR . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive lyophilize black raspberry lozenges orally ( PO ) 4 time daily ( QID ) 6 month . ARM II : Patients receive lyophilize black raspberry lozenge . After completion study treatment , patient Arm I follow 5 year patient Arm II follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
