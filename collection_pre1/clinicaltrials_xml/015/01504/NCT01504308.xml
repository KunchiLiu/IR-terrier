	<brief_title>Sonalleve Fibroid Ablation Pivotal Clinical Trial MR-HIFU Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine Fibroids common benign tumor pre- peri-menopausal woman . Fibroids occur 20-50 % woman 30 year age , increase size produce pain , menorrhagia , pressure , bloat urinary bowel compression symptom . Fibroids may also cause infertility . Symptomatic fibroid impact health well-being female include lose work hour reduce quality life . Current medical treatment include invasive removal fibroid ( hysterectomy , myomectomy ) , drug therapy , treatment cause necrosis fibroid tissue ablation ( freeze heating ) embolization . It estimate 600,000 hysterectomy perform per year United States half conducted hysterectomy due fibroid . For relief symptom , woman wish preserve uterus may choose invasive procedure myomectomy , Uterine Artery Embolization ( UAE ) , ablation cryotherapy . The surgically invasive procedure require anesthesia , hospital stay , long recovery period . However , High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) show promise result relieve fibroid symptom . This study confirm safety clinical effectiveness Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU Fibroid Therapy system ablate symptomatic fibroid .</detailed_description>
