	<detailed_description>This open label multicenter study safety efficacy active implantable vagal nerve stimulation ( VNS ) device patient rheumatoid arthritis . Patients complete study SPM-005 enrol study time last visit precede study . The assessment last visit precede study also use baseline measure current study . If patient previously discontinue SPM-005 great 30 day elapse since final visit SPM-005 , baseline measure current study repeat , interim medical history take assess whether new medical condition diagnose time study . Follow-up visit occur 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 48 month . A final follow-up visit occur remain patient study closure final enrol subject complete 48 month study . The study continue last patient enter complete 48 month study . An Interim Visit phone contact must perform maximum 2 month change device setting . Interim visit may also perform time investigator 's discretion ; either schedule visit , patient complete Month 48 Visit , study still ongoing . The primary efficacy objective determine long term efficacy vagal nerve stimulation assess DAS28 score . The secondary efficacy objective determine long term efficacy vagal nerve stimulation assess : - ACR 20 , 50 70 response rate , - EULAR response rate , - change Euro-QoL score . The safety objective determine long term safely vagal nerve stimulation assess subject incidence rate : - Adverse event - Serious adverse event - Device deficiency</detailed_description>
