	<brief_title>L-Arginine , Symmetrical Asymmetrical Dimethylarginine ( SDMA/ADMA ) Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) frequent complication severe implication deteriorate overall prognosis . Nitric oxide ( NO ) -signal transduction play important role mediate renal damage . NO produced NO-synthase ( NOS ) L-arginine substrate . Endogenous L-Arginine derivative , asymmetric symmetric dimethylarginines ( ADMA/SDMA ) , inhibit NO-production directly ( AMDA ) block NOS activity indirectly ( SDMA ) block cellular L-Arginine uptake . It well know SDMA ADMA marker renal function ( SDMA ) cardiovascular risk ( ADMA/SDMA ) patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Moreover , ADMA SDMA possibly even trigger cardiovascular risk patient CKD . However , little information regulation influence ADMA/SDMA acute kidney injury .</detailed_description>
