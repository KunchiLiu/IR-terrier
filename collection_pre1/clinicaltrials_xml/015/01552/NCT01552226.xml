	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study 114 patient . The purpose study compare efficacy two standard method analgesia pain control patient undergo elective colon rectal surgery , measure Numeric Pain Scale ( NPS ) need supplemental narcotic analgesic . This study design determine postoperative pain control local analgesic deliver preperitoneally place ON-Q Silver SoakerTM catheter ( CPA ) equivalent continuous epidural analgesia ( CEA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Perioperative analgesia vital part management patient undergo colon rectal surgery , affect well length hospital stay . Neuraxial anesthetic infused epidural spinal catheter become commonplace pain management agent patient . These technique , however , labor-intensive expensive . Alternatively , local analgesic may administer directly surgical wound via silver catheter . Aim Two standard method analgesia pain control colon rectal surgery evaluate systematically determine two approach equivalent term patient pain score supplemental narcotic use . Study Design This prospective randomized study 114 participant undergo elective colon rectal surgery independent academic medical center . The primary outcome post-operative pain control supplemental narcotic usage . Other variable interest - Surgical site infection - The post-operative time return bowel function - The hospital expenses/cost difference - Quality life measure SF- 36 questionnaire</detailed_description>
