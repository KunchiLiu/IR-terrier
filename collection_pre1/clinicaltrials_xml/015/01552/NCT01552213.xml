	<detailed_description>INTAKE VISIT : A health professional performs visit soon diagnosis pregnancy . Standardized glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) draw part routine prenatal panel institution . Women A1C &gt; 6.5 % categorize type 2 diabetes , exclude randomization , refer medical nutrition therapy , blood glucose monitoring , insulin need . Women initial A1C &lt; 5.7 % receive routine prenatal care usual provider screen gestational diabetes Mellitus ( GDM ) second trimester per routine . Standard treatment diabetic group provide independently study , anonymous outcome data available via hospital perinatal database . Women A1c 5.7-6.4 % eligible study . EARLY PRENATAL VISIT : woman A1C 5.7-6.4 % informed provider fall group label `` prediabetes '' outside pregnancy invite learn study . All prediabetic woman ( agree enroll ) inform general health risk appropriate weight gain pregnancy . Women enroll queried regard basic demographic information , pre-pregnancy weight , height , obstetric family history . Standardized weight , blood pressure ( BP ) , body mass index ( BMI ) record . Participants give 1-page survey regard knowledge risk factor diabetes , appropriate weight gain pregnancy , benefit breastfeed . RANDOMIZATION AND MANAGEMENT : Women enroll 13 week gestation stratify BMI &lt; 30 &gt; 30 randomize either : 1 . Minimal Intervention ( Control ) Group : A single visit randomize control trial ( RCT ) -associated dietitian health educator discuss general health risk , good eating habit , appropriate weight gain . This follow routine prenatal care determine provider . 2 . Treatment Group : Treatment glucose intolerance include : Diet : Regular visit dietitian every 2 week emphasize food beverage plan ( Institute Medicine standard ) appropriate energy 45 % carbohydrate ; limit saturate fat ; adequate protein , mineral vitamin intake ; portion control 'carbohydrate counting ' . Food beverage intake divide 3 meal 3 snack self-recorded daily food record . Recommended choice food carbohydrate type take account personal cultural preference . Standardized weight measure charted visit . The MNT plan adjust accord maternal weight gain ongoing glycemic level . Participants continue MNT plan delivery , adjust postpartum need breastfeed . Furthermore group treat : A . EXERCISE : Participants encourage exercise minimum brisk walk 30 minute day ( often 10 minute meal ) . B. SELF BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING : Participants perform finger stick four time day ( fast 1-hour start breakfast , lunch , dinner ) self-recording value . At study visit accuracy write record compare meter memory , glucose value download later analysis . The One Touch Delica UltraMini self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) system use meter , lancets strip provide free charge participant . C. INSULIN : Participants start insulin therapy standard method 25 % fasting finger stick great 99 mg/dL 1-hour post prandial finger stick great 135 mg/dL 2-week interval . 26 WEEKS GESTATION : Participants group assess weight gain blood pressure , complete 75-g , 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ( 2H GTT ) . Those minimal intervention group one abnormal value ADA standard treat GDM . No additional intervention give woman treatment group since already receive treatment . In study , choose use 2H GTT correlate adverse perinatal outcome describe Hyperglycemia Adverse Pregnancy Outcome ( HAPO ) study group . DELIVERY : Recommendations time delivery , management labor , route delivery make usual obstetric care provider independent study personnel . All participant A1C measure indicator late pregnancy glycemic control . Umbilical cord blood collect participant evaluate level c-peptide . Elevated c-peptide measure fetal hyperinsulinemia marker fetopathy24 . Delivery neonatal data collect ( see ) . Participants instruct continue diet therapy least 6 month postpartum 6-WEEK POSTPARTUM VISIT : All participant undergo 2H GTT A1C check . Their weight record compare pre-pregnancy weight . Breastfeeding assess .</detailed_description>
