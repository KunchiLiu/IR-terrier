	<brief_summary>The observed change P. falciparum sensitivity artemisinin lead intensification early detection well treatment monitor malaria infection . It widely accept development resistance delay use combination therapy , especially combination include artemisinin derivative ( act ) . As resistance problem consider extremely serious ; consequence , recommend monotherapy malaria stop . Current WHO guideline recommend drug combination regimens use ACT effective partner medicine use decrease risk development spread artemisinin resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Primaquine Pyronaridine-Artesunate Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current WHO guideline recommend drug combination regimens use ACT effective partner medicine use decrease risk development spread artemisinin resistance . Pyronaridine ( PP ) artesunate ( AS ) antimalarial agent history clinical use separately combination drug . Each drug powerful anti-schizonticidal action . The action artesunate rapid knock-down parasite , drug rapidly clear short systemic half-life . Pyronaridine also effective short-term intermediate blood half-life thus provide sustain schizonticidal effect . The aim fix dose combination pyronaridine artesunate ( PA PYRAMAX® ) treatment uncomplicated acute malaria provide rapid reduction parasitemia short-term regimen , thereby improve compliance reduce risk recrudescence slow elimination pyronaridine . Doses select line current prescribing practice agent use mono-therapy . Primaquine ( PQ ) effective gametocytocide P. falciparum transmission prevention tissue kill radical cure P. vivax P. ovale infection . It give presence antimalarial , necessary study drug interaction primaquine , pyronaridine artesunate . It inevitable near future , pyronaridine-artesunate ( PA ) primaquine ( PQ ) combination treatment become necessary . These drug metabolize cytochrome P450 enzymes potentially cause pharmacokinetic alteration clinically significant drug-drug interaction lead unanticipated adverse reaction therapeutic failure suboptimal exposure parasite . This study plan evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interaction orally administer primaquine pyronaridine-artesunate ( PYRAMAX® ) healthy adult subject . The result interaction study important order provide clinical guidance optimum combination primaquine pyronaridine-artesunate ( PYRAMAX® ) treatment regimens malaria infection .</detailed_description>
