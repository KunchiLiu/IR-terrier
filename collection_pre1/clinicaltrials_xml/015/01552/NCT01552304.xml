	<brief_summary>Hypotheses : 1 . Postoperative oxygen therapy significantly improve postoperative oxygenation OSA surgical patient . 2 . Postoperative oxygen therapy significantly increase number apnea episode duration apnea episode . 3 . Postoperative oxygen therapy significantly increase arterial carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) level OSA surgical patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Supplementation Study Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When patient visit preoperative clinic schedule surgery , study coordinator talk patient . If interested study , he/she ask patient answer couple questionnaire see patient qualify study . Patients ask answer STOP-Bang questionnaire find patient high risk sleep apnea . If result show patient high risk sleep apnea , study coordinator explain study detail go consent form . The coordinator answer question patient may . If patient give consent participate study ; coordinator schedule sleep study sleep monitor patient home convenient time surgery . After telephone confirmation , sleep technician visit home evening schedule date set sleep study monitor device measure blood oxygen level . It would take 20~25 minute hook night sleep study . The sleep technician visit patient 's next morning pick device . The recording sleep study score certified sleep technologist . As study participant , patient randomly ( chance ) assign one follow group : - Control group : Patients manage anesthesiologist surgeon per routine practice . - Oxygen therapy group : Besides surgical procedure routine care provide anesthesiologist surgeon , patient receive postoperative oxygen supplementation nasal prong ( nostril ) 3 liters/ min first 3 night surgery . Regardless group patient , blood oxygen saturation monitor pulse oximeter 1 night preoperatively 3 night postoperatively sleep . The blood carbon dioxide monitor first 2 postoperative night portable transcutaneous CO2 device ( TCM400 ) . On third postoperative night , study patient also monitor simultaneously portable carbon dioxide device ( TCM400 ) portable sleep device . For carbon dioxide monitoring , probe attach patient 's arm connect portable device place besides patient 's bed . Our research staff hook device remove patient .</detailed_description>
