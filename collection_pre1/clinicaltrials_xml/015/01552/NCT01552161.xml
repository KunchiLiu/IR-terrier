	<brief_title>Prevalence Allergic Diseases Atopy Subjects With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) one lead cause death , disability medical resource use worldwide . Atherosclerosis remain basic pathology find CVD . Based theoretical knowledge animal experimental model hypothesize allergic inflammation affect atherosclerotic plaque formation/disruption . The exact nature interaction remain unknown . The process probably take place molecular level involves : specific interleukin formation mast cell recruitment . On one hand pro-allergic interleukin find inhibit atherosclerotic plaque formation experimental animal model . However , hypothesis conclude mediator release mast cell might encourage hypoxemia heart muscle cell thus promote necrosis . Mast cell eosinophils -typically associate allergy - find human heart muscle , cross section coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque . Atopic patient prone IgE-mediated mast cell activation seem run low risk sudden cardiac death myocardial infarction . It may associate fact atopy produce mild haemostatic imbalance similar typical aspirin - moderately long bleeding time , depressed platelet aggregability delay generation thrombin clot blood . Tryptase , one mediator release mast cell widely use marker anaphylaxis , recently show increased serum patient angiographically significant narrowing coronary artery . These result accordance previous finding increase total IgE ( antibody involve type I allergic reaction ) post myocardial infarction . Allergic myocardial infarction ( also know Kounis syndrome ) - condition heart muscle ischemia result allergic insult sometimes even absence permanent coronary artery lesion - another hint support hypothesis possible interaction allergy cardiovascular disease . Despite relatively many report study association molecular , vitro clinical level , research investigating problem whole , connect laboratory data clinical picture , scarce . Our research aim provide epidemiological evidence prevalence allergy atopy well serum allergy marker profile subject coronary artery disease . Our study dedicate post-coronary angiography subject willing express inform consent study participation . Coronarography chosen verification tool several reason : - give accurate diagnosis clinically relevant coronary narrowing basic ECG , ECG exercise test coronary angioCT - enables distinction typical angina pectoris Prinzmetal 's angina - become common procedure Poland give relatively large diverse cohort patient undergoing procedure could address</detailed_description>
