	<brief_summary>Weakness impairment upper limb common contribute factor post stroke disability . Specially design robotic system develop try improve . The investigator already know use help improve limb function stroke present many month . The investigator know whether help early stroke enhance recovery limb function , perhaps prevent weakness become chronic . The investigator plan randomise control blind study explore benefit robot assist therapy early stroke 80 stroke survivor . Participants randomise 7 day stroke standard care robotic therapy ( 40 participant per study group ) . Standard care rehabilitation therapy accord local guideline deliver NHS multidisciplinary team . Robotic therapy session last approximately one hour consist series task first unimpaired impaired limb . The robotic-assisted therapy consist series taks include circle-drawing , reach target holding/moving moderate resistance . Twelve session therapy within first 4 week randomisation deliver . This study take 3 year complete .</brief_summary>
