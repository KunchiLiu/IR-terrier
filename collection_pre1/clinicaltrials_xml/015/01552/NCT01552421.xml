	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient result moderate severe pain first postoperative day . This subside second third postoperative day [ 1 ] . A feeling low general well-being also present first postoperative day subside next couple day [ 2 ] . To achieve faster recovery laparoscopic intervention show reduction size laparoscopic port thereby incision reduce postoperative pain [ 3,4 ] . Whether reduction postoperative pain achieve limiting number laparoscopic port abdominal wall single one Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery ( SILS ) remain determined [ 5,6 ] . A new minimal invasive surgical technique base principle completely eliminate use port abdominal wall . This new technique call Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) define acquire minimal invasive access abdominal cavity body 's natural opening like mouth stomach , anus , urethra vagina . With NOTES technique one completely avoid incision abdominal wall thereby reduce surgical trauma . The benefit technique reduction postoperative pain , elimination incisional hernia , prevention wound infection , reduction peritoneal adherence formation , achieve faster recovery well cosmetic result [ 7,8 ] . The documented well-described way gain NOTES access abdominal cavity vagina , transvaginal ( TV ) . There several reason . First technique gain TV access abdominal cavity already use gynaecology , culdoscopy first describe literature nearly 100 year ago [ 9 ] . A diagnostic procedure infertility use outpatient set [ 10-12 ] . Similarly , transvaginal port use gynaecology substitute abdominal port [ 13,14 ] . Thus already well proven establish technique obtain transvaginal access abdominal cavity . Secondly easy ensure secure surgical closure point entry direct visualization basic suture instrument . And lastly risk contamination infection minimal perform TV procedure [ 15 ] . TV NOTES mainly use cholecystectomy direct line vision upper abdomen include liver gallbladder achieve body opening . For reason possible use surgical dissection technique rigid instrument use perform conventional laparoscopic SILS cholecystectomy . Questionnaire survey show general interest TV NOTES public , 33-68 % woman survey preferred TV NOTES conventional laparoscopy [ 16-18 ] . In German national database call German NOTES Registry ( GNR ) 900 transvaginal procedure register . Compilation result GNR human series multicenter trial show TV NOTES cholecystectomy implement low complication rate [ 19-21 ] . One retrospective case-control one prospective observational study report less postoperative pain , reduce consumption analgesic faster recovery TV NOTES cholecystectomy compare conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy [ 22,23 ] . To date systematic prospective randomize data whether TV NOTES cholecystectomy lead well surgical outcome regard pain , well-being etc . conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . STUDY AIM : The aim study prospective randomize blind design compare postoperative course outcome TV NOTES conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . HYPOTHESIS : TV NOTES cholecystectomy give less postoperative pain , fatigue nausea , reduce analgesic consumption give well cosmetic result well-being conventional 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy . TRIAL PARTICIPANTS : Trial participant recruit among woman 40-75 year refer laparoscopic cholecystectomy due symptomatic gallstone gallstone induce mild pancreatitis ultrasonography confirm gallstone . METHOD : Statistics : The primary outcome measure `` cumulate pain score mobilisation first 72 postoperative hour '' use power calculation . In previous study mean parameter measure visual analogue scale ( VAS ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy find 143 mm ( standard deviation 95,7 mm ) [ 2 ] . Since pain sensation laparoscopic cholecystectomy somatic origin MERIDIF 60 % ( 86mm ) chosen . Type I type II error set 0,05 0,20 respectively . This give total number 42 participant 21 allocate either group . To account potential dropout lack Gaussian distribution VAS data include total 60 participant 30 allocate either group . Non-parametric statistic FisherÂ´s exact test , Mann-Whitney test confidence interval use appropriate . P &lt; 0,05 consider statistical significant . Drop-outs replace new participant minimum 30 participant include either group . Data analyse intention-to treat per-protocol result method publish . In TV NOTES group use least one 5mm trans-abdominal port consider conversion conventional laparoscopic surgery analyse . The use one Minilap instrument TV NOTES group consider conversion laparoscopy participant remain TV NOTES group intention-to-treat per-protocol analysis . Participants severe intra-operative complication exclude analysis describe separately publication . Randomization : Participants randomize either TV NOTES cholecystectomy conventional laparoscopic 4 port cholecystectomy . The randomization perform shortly operation commences use envelope method operate surgeon . All procedure perform surgeon University Hospital Gentofte/Herlev , Copenhagen , Denmark . Blinding : The trial patient observer blind allocation randomization first 72 hour postoperative course . Operating room staff surgeon participate way follow-up first 72 postoperative hour . Participants group receive surgical dress abdomen procedure . Both group thus bandage conventional 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy total 4 dress strip . In TV NOTES group dressing stain red simulate light seepage `` wound '' . These dressing obligatory first 72 postoperative hour . Informed consent : The participant receive oral write information trial , purpose potential benefit risk . Participants inform voluntary participate time withdraw consent participate trial without implication present future treatment . Written consent participate trial obtain enrolment . National guideline Danish National Committee Biomedical Research Ethics concern inform content follow . Any information medical consideration concern individual participant obtain part trial accessible participant . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : TV NOTES cholecystectomy base well-established surgical technique laparoscopy/SILS culdotomy . Complication type rate TV NOTES cholecystectomy well described literature comparable conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Considering advantage theoretical benefit new technique offer combine preliminary retrospective non-randomized result find ethical conduct randomize control blind trial benefit TV NOTES cholecystectomy outweigh potential risk involve . LAW AND APPROVAL : The trial carry accord Helsinki Declaration II Acts Danish Council Ethics information concern participant protect accordance regulation set Danish Protection Agency . The trial approve Danish National Committee Biomedical Research Ethics , Danish Protection Agency ClinicalTrials.gov commence . FUNDING : This trial part PhD-study initiated trial investigator . Salaries fund grant obtain University Copenhagen , Herlev Hospital Research Council , Capitol Region Denmark Research Foundation Health Research private foundation . Operating cost found grant private foundation . There commercial interest financial support project . PUBLICATION : After trial complete positive negative result publish internationally recognised scientific journal . The primary investigator trial first-author co-investigators co-authors accord Vancouver Group criterion ( www.icmje.org ) .</detailed_description>
