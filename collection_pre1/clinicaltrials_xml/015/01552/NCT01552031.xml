	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) pathological condition whose progression characterize stable period break intermittent acute exacerbation symptom , severe inflammatory process occur often requiring hospitalization . During exacerbation risk death high make social economical impact event important . The need rationalize utilization health care resource together optimization patient 's care prompt development model assistance base home monitoring . At present time suggest model base utilization diary symptom perceive patient . Even positive result report term reduction hospitalization many COPD patient tend underestimate severity condition compliance record symptom rapidly decrease time . Attempts use objective measurement home spirometer do poor result report mainly due difficulty perform spirometric test without medical supervision . A suitable approach get objective information function respiratory system Forced Oscillation Technique ( FOT ) . Such methodology base analysis response system small pressure stimuli over-imposed normal breathing patient . The measurement require minimal cooperation perform without medical supervision . The purpose study measure daily variability FOT data measure home group COPD patient order identify possible correlation symptom change , breathe pattern , lung mechanical impedance occurrence exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The continuous progress medical science technology improvement life condition increase life expectancy industrialized country : result progressive population age [ UN , 2002 ] . One consequence trend increase number people suffer chronic disease . Among pathology chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) important number patient deaths affect 80 million people world [ WHO , 2006 ] . The time course disease characterize stable period break intermittent acute exacerbation symptom , severe inflammatory process occur , lead increase airways obstruction . During exacerbation risk death high [ Connors et al , 1996 ; Soler-Cataluna et al , 2005 ] . Moreover frequency severity exacerbation correlate worsen health condition patient [ Anzueto et al , 2009 ; Donaldson et al , 2002 ] . The burden care patient COPD national health care system society high . The utilization health care resource patient COPD primarily due acute exacerbation require care emergency room hospital [ Dal Negro , 2008 ] . In last year need rationalize health care cost prompt development new technology home monitoring patient mainly aim early detection onset exacerbation . This could help development new therapeutic organizational model aim reduce impact event quality life patient national health care system . Published data offer several different follow-up model home monitoring COPD . Written electronic diary , questionnaire , telephonic assistance respiratory nurse specialize clinical personnel use web-based call center suggest follow patient discharge hospital . Even positive result report term reduction hospitalization [ Vitacca et al , 2009 ] many COPD patient tend underestimate severity condition [ Cote et al , 1998 ] patient 's compliance recording symptom rapidly decrease time [ Cote et al , 1998 ] . Moreover , author address difficulty evaluate correctly impact model patient 's quality life reduction hospitalization mortality rate [ Ram et al , 2004 ; Bolton et al , 2010 ] . An effective home monitoring system COPD patient follow characteristic : 1. easy use unsupervised environment , 2. able provide sensible objective information patient status , 3. low cost . Clinically , diagnosis monitoring COPD patient base spirometric parameter , FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume 1 second ) , FVC ( force vital capacity ) FEV1/FVC obtain force expiratory maneuver [ Gold , 2009 ] . However , patient affect COPD , difficult execute spirometry correctly poor ability perform force maneuver . For reason necessary test supervise physician [ Miller et al , 2005 ] . Moreover , general belief medical community FEV1 insensitive change short period time patient COPD controversy surround reliance parameter accurate metric acute respiratory event . These may reason study patient monitor home spirometry peak-flow meter report poor result [ Brouwer et al , 2010 ] . A promising technology home monitoring respiratory disease represent Forced Oscillations Technique ( FOT ) . FOT base analysis response respiratory system external pressure stimulus superimpose spontaneous breathe patient . It require cooperation patient provide accurate measurement even without supervision specialize personnel . In last year new technology base FOT special algorithm develop respiratory research group Bioengineering Department Politecnico di Milano University , Italy . These methodology already test prove effective automatic quantitative evaluation several phenomenon include : - presence Expiratory Flow Limitation ( EFL ) breath breath [ Dellaca ' et al , 2004 ] ; - airway resistance correct artifact introduce EFL [ Dellaca ' et al , 2009 ] ; - degree airways heterogeneity measure analysis frequency dependency resistance ; - response respiratory system administration bronchodilator bronchoconstrictors [ Dellaca ' et al , 2009 ] . Recently spin-off company respiratory group Bioengineering Department Politecnico di Milano make available special device ( RESMONPRO-diary ) suitable collect data patient 's home without medical supervision . Data prototype device record asthmatic patient show suitability remote unsupervised monitor chronic condition . AIM OF THE STUDY The aim present study evaluate possibility monitoring oscillatory parameter lung mechanic , measure Forced Oscillation Technique ( FOT ) , early detection exacerbation COPD patient . Therefore primary outcome identification relationship change patient 's symptom , breathe pattern , lung mechanical impedance index occurrence exacerbation . A outcome study identification classification occur exacerbation . STUDY PROTOCOL Pre-study measurement : After enrollment study , every subject visit physician undergo standard pulmonary function test . Moreover follow data collect : - exacerbation history - smoking history - disease history - presence co-morbidities Daily home monitoring program : All patient monitor home use device oscillometric measurement lung functionality ( RESMON pro ) . The duration measurement 2-3 minute day period comprise 6 8 month . At begin measurement device ask patient fill simple questionnaire self-evaluation symptom ( dyspnoea , amount purulence sputum , wheeze , cough ) . For duration study , participant ask wear Actiwatch Spectrum 24 hour day . The Actiwatch Spectrum , small watch-like device , measure activity record analyze reading on-board accelerometer . Each 1-minute activity epoch analyze statistical result store on-board memory hold six-months data . The Actigraphy data provide objective record activity validate determine normal abnormal sleep / wake pattern . A nurse perform weekly phone interview order collect information presence timing follow event : - Change current drug therapy - Systemic steroid use/prescription - Antibiotic use/prescription - Hospitalization due respiratory cause - Emergency Room admission - Unscheduled GP call - Unscheduled GP visit - Specialist visit - Worsening sleep - Worsening dyspnea daily life activity - Fever DATA ANALYSIS The time-series data variability analyze use method time irreversibility , sample multiscale entropy , Gumbel 's extreme value statistic . The predictor exacerbation derive calculate conditional probability future acute event give trend variability index derive method . Additionally data analyze also use deterministic approach : linear non-linear modelling analysis</detailed_description>
