	<brief_title>The RETINA Project : Reliable Eye Tracking Neurocognitive Assessment Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate novel method neurocognitive assessment use computerized eye track . This method involve look target computer screen eye-tracking system record eye movement change pupil diameter response presentation target . Performance eye track measure evaluate identify potential effect neural injury cognitive performance . Data individual without history brain injury use standardize eye track measure . Participants also complete short interview several self report measure , include information demographic characteristic , medical history , psychological symptom , along series neuropsychological/cognitive measure already well establish . Performance eye track measure compare performance conventional cognitive test allow comparison different measure . All participant complete one visit laboratory USUHS Bethesda , MD . This visit take approximately 2.5 hour . Participants without history TBI may ask return 30 minute follow-up session order measure reliability eye track system . Participants history TBI complete 10 minute telephone follow-up 6 12 month visit . Compensation available civilian employ Federal government .</detailed_description>
