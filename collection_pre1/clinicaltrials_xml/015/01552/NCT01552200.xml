	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare additional diagnostic yield obtain perform NaviAid™ G-Eye procedure vs. diagnostic yield obtain perform standard colonoscopy procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation NaviAid™ G-Eye System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy gold-standard method CRC screening , enable detection real-time removal pre-cancerous polyp examination . It well know lesion miss routine colonoscopy.5 major reason detail miss polyp colonoscopy : polyp hide behind fold , polyp mask colon 's topography natural fold , shallow polyp , unscreened portion colon ( due incomplete colonoscopy ) endoscope slippage . The NaviAid™ G-Eye system present unique concept overcome 5 item list , provide overall solution two endoscopy key challenge limit detection/treatment yield limit operation range . The G-Eye endoscope comprise standard endoscope onto unique balloon permanently integrate , bend section . The NaviAid™ G-Eye may use perform control withdrawal endoscope stabilization . A major attribute NaviAid™ G-Eye system control withdrawal technique endoscope , balloon moderately inflated expand stretch intestinal lumen endoscope withdrawal . This multicenter , two-arm , randomize , open-label study intend compare additional diagnostic yield obtain perform NaviAid™ G-Eye procedure vs. diagnostic yield obtain perform standard colonoscopy procedure . Subjects randomize one two group : Group A , `` Study Group , '' Group B , `` Control Group . '' Group A : Subjects undergo complete standard colonoscopy first procedure . Immediately standard colonoscopy procedure , complete NaviAid™ G-Eye procedure perform endoscopist . Group B : Subjects undergo complete NaviAid™ G-Eye procedure first procedure . Immediately NaviAid™ G-Eye procedure , complete standard colonoscopy perform endoscopist .</detailed_description>
