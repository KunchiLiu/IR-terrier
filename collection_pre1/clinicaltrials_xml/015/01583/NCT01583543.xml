	<brief_title>Olaparib Adults With Recurrent/Metastatic Ewing 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives Evaluate objective response rate olaparib adult patient recurrent and/or metastatic Ewing 's sarcoma follow failure conventional chemotherapy . Secondary Objectives To evaluate progression-free survival , overall survival , safety olaparib patient population . As exploratory objective , investigator evaluate ( subject agree optional biopsy ) differences pre- post-treatment tumor DNA alteration difference level protein RNA expression relate PARP inhibition . Study Design Potential subject discuss sign inform consent form undergo screen study . Eligible patient administer olaparib obtain restaging image study 6 12 week study , every 8 week thereafter . Participants remain study drug disease progression , onset unacceptable toxicity , subject withdraws consent .</detailed_description>
