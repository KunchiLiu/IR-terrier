	<brief_summary>As individual age , undergo transition many aspect life . These transition include social , economic health transition . People review life , reflect past choice . Future time limited increase proximity end life . This may lead regret , people ability use compensatory mechanism , redouble effort achieve value goal reprioritization value goal . In context aging , individual ' past , present , future-oriented subjective well-being ( SWB ) may change . There incomplete understanding relationship SWB , intra- inter-personal resource , outcome , ( particularly health healthcare-cost outcome ) . These issue complicate use SWB measure investigator leave traditional metric life expectancy , infant mortality , wealth , poverty ass healthy aging , result incomplete picture healthy age . This project examine relationship among SWB , intra- inter-personal resource , health healthcare-cost outcome . It advance understand SWB role healthy age order assist policy maker value potential benefit improve SWB health healthcare cost . The investigator accomplish follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine SWB ( past , present , future-oriented ) : ( 1 ) affect life transition , ( 2 ) affect outcomes life transition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temporally-Oriented Subjective Well-being Across Transitions—Resources &amp; Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : To determine Subjective Well-Being ( SWB ; past , present , future-oriented ) : ( 1 ) affect life transition , ( 2 ) affect outcomes life transition . Rationale : Social , economic , health transition common age population . Adaptation transition likely impact SWB therefore may alter subsequent health healthcare-cost outcome . Hypotheses : Negative life transition negatively impact assessment present future-oriented SWB result bad health healthcare-cost outcome . More positive intra- inter-personal resource lessen impact . Having well present future-oriented SWB diminish impact transition health healthcare-cost outcome . Approach : Investigators establish observational cohort adult age 50 older ( n=600 ) see primary care practice stratify gender , race , SWB . Investigators collect information baseline two annual follow-up assessment regard SWB , intra- inter-personal resource , outcome . Investigators compare experience life transition term change temporal perspective SWB , health , healthcare-cost outcome . The successful completion project disentangle temporal perspective SWB , understand impact age life transition SWB , relate individual ' SWB health healthcare-cost outcome , clarify relationship experienced SWB evaluative SWB , within context intra- inter-personal resource . It enable researcher , clinician , policy maker well use SWB metric assess health welfare individual society . The study population primarily old adult primary care practice , University Pittsburgh 's General Internal Medicine Oakland ( GIMO ) . Aim : To determine SWB ( past , present , future-oriented ) : 1 ) affect life transition 2 ) affect outcomes life transition . C.2.a . Overview Aim Social , economic , health transition , commonly occur age population . Adaptation transition likely impact SWB subsequent health healthcare-cost outcome . Investigators enroll purposive sample ( n=600 ) adult age 50 old see GIMO primary care practice . Investigators collect information baseline two annual follow-up assessment regard SWB , intra- inter-personal resource outcomes . Investigators compare experience life transition term change temporally-oriented SWB health healthcare-cost outcome . Measures In addition basic demographic include age , gender , ethnicity , race , educational attainment , marital status , employment status , investigator collect data described . Subjective Well-Being . Investigators use temporal measure SWB Pavot , Deiner , Suh8 include 15 items—5 represent past , present , future-oriented SWB . Intra- inter-personal resource . These construct select important understanding SWB relationship SWB outcomes test model . Each instrument relate health outcome , healthcare-cost outcome , SWB , and/or health-related quality life prior work key citation provide . Bringing together comprehensive assessment battery understand temporally-oriented SWB relationship measure outcomes , impact transition relationship , relationship experience experience SWB evaluative SWB , propose current project , necessary advance field . Definition transition . Separate group define undergo , undergo , three broad category transition : social , economic , health , three transition ; individual may one type transition . In addition `` '' transition , transition type analyze separately . As described significance section , investigator find transition common old adult . Participants complete item Life Events Scale time-point . Investigators use MARS EpicCare identify new health condition ( base addition problem list past medical history ) supplement identification health transition . Health healthcare cost . Investigators use health healthcare cost assess predictive validity measure Primary care sample . Health healthcare-cost measure obtain use Medical Archival System ( MARS ) 43 EpicCare electronic medical record ( EMR ) . MARS data include patient see University Pittsburgh Medical Center 's ( UPMC ) twenty hospital , four long-term care facility , 350 physician office outpatient clinic . The MARS repository house 209 million clinical report , 460 million financial transaction , patient demographic information . EpicCare , GIMO 's EMR , electronically contain information require traditional paper medical record . All documentation ( include past medical history ) , order , result capture . Any paper result , example laboratory test do state , abstract discrete data item EpicCare . The primary measure healthcare cost . Cost outcome , MARS EpicCare , include total healthcare charge document within UPMC system ( include outpatient prescription medication average retail cost ) year follow assessment . As large provider care Western Pennsylvania , UPMC delivers vast majority care receive GIMO patient . Why use cost primary measure sample ? Healthcare cost provide relatively simple summary overall care intensity across people variety health concern particularly relevant health policy . It broadly applicable responsive request application . Two alternative endpoint diagnosis new medical condition disease management process measure . Based prior experience , expect majority participant develop new medical condition , treat new diagnosis primary measure would give minimal variation measure would limit ability see difference base temporally associate SWB . GIMO 's clinical variety make disease management process measure impractical primary measure . Investigators choose examine two common primary care condition , diabetes coronary artery disease , require patient physician participation management secondary measure . Secondary health measure include ( 1 ) number new diagnosis develop , ( 2 ) hospitalization ( yes ) , among hospitalize , length stay , ( 3 ) disease management one year . Investigators track development follow condition identify Verbrugge Patrick : arthritis , visual impairment , hear impairment , ischemic heart disease , hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , diabetes mellitus , malignant neoplasm.42 A diagnosis consider new use billing diagnosis use previously bill diagnosis list problem list past medical history . Because participant see past GIMO able easily differentiate new previously exist diagnosis . Hospitalization define admission one twenty UPMC medical psychiatric hospital length stay . Disease management base percent fulfil quality metric ( total number metric fulfil , divide total number metric ) define NCQA44 use quality measure GIMO .</detailed_description>
