	<brief_summary>This pilot study primary purpose describe organ dosimetry acute toxicity use carrier add carrier add 124I-MIBG PET/CT patient neuroblastoma ( NB ) . Eligible patient 3 year age old relapse refractory neuroblastoma currently enrol treatment protocol 131I-MIBG . After eligibility criterion meet , patient receive diagnostic imaging dose 124I-MIBG follow sequential PET/CT dosimetry scan Days 0 , 1 , 2 5 . Subsequent , plan therapeutic administration 131I-MIBG occur Days 7 21 , specify patient 's therapeutic MIBG protocol . An optional single follow 124I-MIBG PET-CT scan do assess tumor sit 6 week patient MIBG therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accurate radiation dose evaluation important patient malignant tumor , especially critical child NB receive several dose therapeutic 131I . The accurate quantification isotope-labeled analog achieve use positron emission compound , 124I . Unlike planar image , use obtain kinetic information , SPECT reconstruction modality aim assess spatial distribution radioactivity , 3D PET imaging-based dosimetry method provide accurate estimation cumulate radioactivity distribution . Because PET provide well quantitative accuracy , compare SPECT regard tissue absorb information , hypothesize PET would better correspond tumor response normal organ toxicity . Early study use I-124 dosimetry thyroid cancer promising . Demonstration feasibility accuracy new image modality , excellent prospect accurate dosimetry , improve tumor localization optimize therapeutic dose 131I-MIBG . The result work may potentially also implication study neuroendocrine tumor . The Section Nuclear Medicine Laboratory Functional Imaging University California , San Francisco , equip state art instrument run highly skilled staff guarantee success propose research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age : Patients must &gt; /= 3 year age able cooperate PET CT scan register study . Diagnosis : Patients must diagnosis neuroblastoma either histologic verification neuroblastoma and/or demonstration tumor cell bone marrow increase urinary catecholamine metabolite . Disease Status : Patients must highrisk neuroblastoma least ONE following : Recurrent/progressive disease time . Biopsy require , even partial response intervene therapy . Refractory disease ( i.e . less partial response frontline therapy , include minimum 4 cycle chemotherapy ) . No biopsy require eligibility study . 123IMIBG Uptake : Patients must MIBG evaluable disease define evidence uptake tumor &gt; /= one site within 4 week prior entry study subsequent intervening therapy . 131IMIBG Therapy : Patients must meet eligibility criterion 131IMIBG therapy . Reproductive Function : All postmenarchal female must negative betaHCG within 2 week prior receive dose 124IMIBG . Males females childbearing potential must practice effective method birth control participate study , avoid possible damage fetus . Pregnancy lactate intent breast feeding . Patients require general anesthesia MIBG imaging study .</criteria>
