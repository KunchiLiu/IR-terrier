	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient metastatic cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-mesothelin incorporated retrovirus . Objective : The purpose study determine safe number cell infuse see tumor fight cell ( anti-mesothelin cell ) cause metastatic cancer tumor shrink . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 metastatic cancer express mesothelin molecule . Design : Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti-mesothelin cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-mesothelin cell , aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting Mesothelin Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain chimeric T cell receptor ( CAR ) recognize mesothelin , use mediate genetic transfer CAR high efficiency ( &gt; 50 % ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures mesothelin express cell , anti-mesothelin transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN-gamma high specificity . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - To evaluate safety administration anti-mesothelin CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocytes patient receive non- myeloablative conditioning regimen , aldesleukin . - Determine administration anti-mesothelin CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer . Secondary Objective : -Determine vivo survival CAR gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must - Metastatic unresectable cancer express mesothelin ; - Previously receive non-responder recur standard care ; Patients may : -Contraindications low dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis culture order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10^8 5 X 10^8 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-mesothelin CAR . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo CAR gene-transduced PBMC plus low dose IV aldesleukin - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , CT chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient SD tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design . Once MTD determine , study would proceed phase II portion . Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient mesothelioma , cohort 2 include patient type cancer express mesothelin . - For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Metastatic unresectable measurable cancer express mesothelin . As protocol conduct Dr. Hassan NCI , epitheial mesothelioma pancreatic cancer need assess mesothelin expression since tumor show express mesothelin . Other metastatic unresectable cancer must show express mesothelin assess RTPCR immunohistochemistry tumor tissue . Biphasic mesothelioma must express mesothelin great 50 % cell epithelial component . Diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . 2 . Patients must previously receive least one systemic standard care ( effective salvage chemotherapy regimen ) metastatic unresectable disease , know effective disease , either nonresponders ( progressive disease ) recur . 3 . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . 4 . Willing sign durable power attorney 5 . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document 6 . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . 7 . Life expectancy great three month . 8 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month treatment . 9 . Serology : 1 . Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) 2 . Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 10 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 11 . Hematology : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) without support filgrastim . 2 . WBC ( &gt; 3000/mm ( 3 ) ) . 3 . Platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . 4 . Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl . 12 . Chemistry : 1 . Serum ALT/AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal . 2 . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl . 3 . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 13 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients sarcomatoid mesothelioma mesothelin express type mesothelioma . 2 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis . 4 . Patients receive full dose anticoagulative therapy . 5 . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 6 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 7 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 8 . Patients diabetic retinopathy . 9 . Concurrent Systemic steroid therapy . 10 .
