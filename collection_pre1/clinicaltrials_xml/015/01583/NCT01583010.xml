	<brief_summary>Needle tip visualization , although fundamental safety efficacy ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia ( UGRA ) , extremely challenge . This problem mark steep insertion angle . Studies patient UGRA demonstrate echogenic needle design potential offer improved visibility accuracy . Our study pursue another approach . We use ( differentiation ) echogenic nerve block needle ANV® , new SonoSite software-upgrade ( Advanced Needle Visualization Technology® ) . We compare UGRA ANV® standard UGRA without use SonoSite software-upgrade . Patients undergoing femoral , supraclavicular nerve block part routine anesthetic management include . This work represent first randomize control double blinded clinical trial ANV® patient undergo UGRA . We hypothesize , decrease time without needle visualization ( Loss needle time percentage procedure time ) in-line regional anaesthesia . Furthermore record quality visibility , duration procedure insertion angle needle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients schedule undergo surgery femoral ( n = 50 ) supraclavicular ( n=50 ) anaesthesia ( 100 block total ) get include study . These 50 patient randomize equally use seal opaque envelope two parallel group : standard treatment UGRA ( n=25 ) SonoSites ANV® ( n= 25 ) UGRA . An experienced anaesthesiologist department anaesthesiology , general intensive care pain medicine perform UGRA . Because safety reason best assessment needle visibility UGRA study go perform in-plane ultrasound technique . Needle length gauge standardize . The ultrasound imaging nerve block get record onto DVD analysis . Recording perform UGRA start placement ultrasound probe finish needle leave skin ( procedure time ) , get store , checked exclude technical failure analyse one second discrimination two blind observer needle visibility . All information indicate ANV®-status ultrasound image delete . Hence procedure follow analysis ensure patient objective observer blind . Images full needle visibility relate image without needle visibility . Time needle visibility describe percent procedure time . Enduring visualization complete needle ultrasound beam wo n't give whole procedure . For differentiation complete needle visibility , partial visibility in-plane UGRA , use needle ultrasound visible mark ( echogenic needle ) . If objective observer visualize 3 mark pole needle ultrasound-image , needle completely in-plane visible analysis . For partial visibility mark use needle visibility grade dependent number visible mark ( One mark = poor visibility , two mark = middle visibility , three marks=good visibility ) . If wo n't visible mark ultrasound image , needle absence get evaluate `` visible '' . Dependent position anatomic target structure nerve block need different angle needle insertion . This measure angle use compare time needle visibility dependent insertion angle needle . Significant difference may appear especially steep angle needle . In study use Naropin® ( Ropivaciane , 7.5mg/ml ) local anaesthetic UGRA .</detailed_description>
