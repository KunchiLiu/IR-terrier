	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To assess multichannel physiologic measure associate mood disorder . Hypothesis : The overall hypothesis nonlinear dynamic analysis able reveal hidden pattern complexity domain voice , heart rate variability ( RR interval ) , movement , arousal , sleep stage data . Aim 2 : To assess difference pattern complexity multiple physiological measure patient MDD compare healthy control . Hypothesis : MDD associate decreased measure complexity increase measure approximate entropy compare healthy control . Aim 3 : To assess difference pattern complexity multiple physiologic measure patient BD compare healthy control . Hypothesis : BD associate decreased measure complexity increase measure approximate entropy compare healthy control . Aim 4 : To assess change pattern complexity multiple physiologic measure baseline 2 week treatment patient MDD BD . Hypothesis : Measures complexity increase measure approximate entropy decrease first two week treatment . Aim 5 : To assess relationship change pattern complexity multiple physiologic measure change mood state . Hypothesis : Measures complexity increase measure approximate entropy decrease , especially much much improve</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 &lt; 65 . Meet DSMIV criterion MDD ( n=5 ) , BD ( n=5 ) , healthy control psychiatric diagnosis ( n=5 ) . Willing able wear wearable device measure sleep parameter Willing able provide voice sample . Subjects MDD must take psychiatric medication time evaluation.Subjects BD take psychiatric medication , since feasible patient BD completely free mood stabilize medication . These medication limit lithium , second generation antipsychotic . Currently patient research participant DCRP BCRP healthy control enrol evaluation study .
