	<brief_summary>The aim research examine brushless scrub effective reduce bioburden hand operate room ( OR ) personnel prewash one minute prior scrub without prewash prior scrub , compare bioburden reduction method . Hypothesis I : A soap water prewash use prior brushless scrub decrease bioburden brushless scrub alone . Hypothesis II : Brushless scrub effective reduce bioburden measure application brushless scrub within 20 second application group . Exploratory Hypothesis : We also compare bioburden measure 1.5 minute application brushless scrub group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hand wash operating room personnel prior surgical procedure essential prevention intraoperative infection . The use brushless surgical hand hygiene use since CDC state 2002 use brush sponge longer necessary . Empirical literature support reduction incidence bacteria OR personnel hand use alcohol-based product . An annotated integrative search literature conduct conflict information regard use prewash prior brushless scrub find . This study help u utilize brushless scrub full capacity prevent surgical site infection . The time point outcome measure assess individual level immediately pre-intervention also 1.5 minute intervention . For example , within 15 second prior brushless scrub , prewash , sample swab collect another sample swab obtain 1.5 minute later postintervention measure . The study take approximately 4 month complete get adequate sample size individual statistical power . The data aggregate presented staff in-service within 3 month data collection analysis complete .</detailed_description>
