	<brief_summary>Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) common complication mechanical ventilation associate significant morbidity , include prolongation mechanical ventilation increase ICU hospital length-of-stay . Numerous strategy propose decrease occurrence VAP among ventilated patient . Most notably , optimize use daily sedative interruption daily spontaneous breathing trial improve sedative management , decrease ventilator time , improve outcome mechanically ventilate patient , possibly decrease VAP.Combining daily sedative interruption daily spontaneous breathe trial confers additive improvement ventilator day , intensive care day , possibly mortality compare daily spontaneous breathe trial alone . The primary aim study determine impact opt-out protocol pair daily sedative interruption spontaneous breathe trial VAP rate use new streamline VAP definition . The investigator evaluate responsiveness CDC 's proposed new surveillance definition ventilator-associated event quality improvement initiative . The study nest within Epicenters Streamlined versus Conventional VAP Surveillance Study . Nine 18 hospital large study participate intervention arm .</brief_summary>
