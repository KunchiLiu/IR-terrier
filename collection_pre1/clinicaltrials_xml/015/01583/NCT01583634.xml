	<brief_title>Accuracy Oximeters With Hypoxia Methemoglobin Carboxyhemoglobin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conventional pulse oximeter standard clinical care non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring , measure arterial blood oxygenation . There many clinical situation tissue hypoxia may exist despite normal value obtain conventional pulse oximeter . This cause inadequate monitoring oxygen demand ( i.e . venous oxygen saturation ) tissue . The exist method venous blood oxygenation monitor either invasive fiber optic catheter , intermittently blood sample CO-oximetry . However , catheterization costly include inherent risk . Therefore , due inherent risk catheterization , venous oximetry limit critically ill patient . The clinical application venous oximetry numerous , include severe sepsis septic shock , severe trauma hemorrhagic shock , heart failure cardiac arrest . More complete information patient hemodynamics provide non-invasively monitor venous blood oxygenation .</detailed_description>
