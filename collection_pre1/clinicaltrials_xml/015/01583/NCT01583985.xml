	<brief_summary>Chronic musculoskeletal pain condition among prevalent condition VA primary care . Over past two decade , improve clinical attention pain associate exponentially great use long-term opioid therapy chronic non-cancer pain , within outside VA system . Despite change practice , proper place opioids chronic pain management continue controversial research demonstrate long-term safety effectiveness opioids chronic musculoskeletal pain . The Strategies Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness ( SPACE ) Trial fill critical gap evidence compare effectiveness harm two clinically relevant analgesic prescribe strategies-one emphasizes early use strong opioids one delay minimize opioid use-for Veterans chronic back , hip , knee pain . SPACE design highly relevant clinical decision-making VA primary care produce knowledge improve life Veterans live chronic pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic musculoskeletal pain condition among common problem see primary care . As importance condition health individual society increasingly recognize , use long-term opioid therapy chronic musculoskeletal pain grow exponentially . Unfortunately , research keep pace change prescribe practice . Although evidence support ability opioid analgesic produce short-term reduction pain intensity , long-term trial evaluate opioid effectiveness available . Evidence effect opioids function quality life limit , observational data indicate many patient treat long-term opioids continue experience severe pain functional limitation . Furthermore , long-term harm opioids poorly describe literature . Preliminary investigation suggest variety potential harm relate opioid therapy , incidence severity harm well-quantified . Objectives : The main objective Strategies Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness ( SPACE ) Trial compare benefit harm two prescribe strategy : 1 ) opioid-intensive strategy use strong opioids , morphine , early treatment , 2 ) opioid-avoidant strategy optimize non-opioid medication delay minimize opioid use . SPACE evaluate , 12 month , 1 ) effect opioid-intensive versus opioid-avoidant prescribing strategy pain-related function pain intensity 2 ) adverse effect opioid-intensive versus opioid-avoidant prescribing strategy , include adverse medication-related symptom , clinically important adverse event , change physical cognitive performance . Secondarily , investigator examine effect two prescribe strategy health-related quality life , pain sensitivity , aberrant drug-related behavior . The investigator also conduct secondary qualitative analysis well understand patient ' perception response intervention value intervention component . Methods : SPACE pragmatic randomize clinical trial design compare benefit harm 12 month two clinically-relevant prescribe strategy chronic musculoskeletal pain . Eligible Veterans see primary care chronic back lower-extremity ( hip knee ) arthritis pain moderate-severe pain intensity interference function . Those currently receive chronic daily opioid therapy exclude . Participants randomize opioid-intensive ( n=138 ) opioid-avoidant ( n=138 ) arm , stratification primary pain location ( back hip/knee ) . Medications arm adjust target improvement pain , consider individual patient preference response . Interventions deliver care management model use randomly assign prescribing strategy , automate symptom monitoring , structure decision-making approach guide medication adjustment . Outcome assessor mask treatment assignment conduct interview ass patient-reported outcome 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month assess physical performance cognitive function 0 , 6 , 12 month . For primary outcome , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) Interference scale , study 80 % power detect 1 point difference group , assume 2-sided alpha=0.05 20 % attrition . Analysis use intent-to-treat approach , include participant arm originally assign .</detailed_description>
