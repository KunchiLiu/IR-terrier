	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) represent major cause morbidity mortality patient underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) [ 1 ] . In gastrointestinal tract one main target organ GvHD diagnosis may difficult many similar present differential diagnosis , notable , infection cytomegalovirus [ 2 ] . Experts disagree best diagnostic approach patient suspect acute gastrointestinal GvHD ( aGI-GvHD ) . There many study support endoscopic evaluation either low [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] , upper [ 6 , 7 ] part GI-tract [ 8 , 9 ] . In either case , histological evaluation biopsy sample serve standard tool establish final diagnosis [ 10 ] . Considering rather bad general condition patient HSCT limit factor endoscopic histological evaluation , new approach introduce diagnostic manual aGI-GvHD order reduce amount invasive examination . Conventional image technique like magnetic resonance image [ 11 ] , computer tomography [ 12 ] high-resolution ultrasonography Doppler Imaging [ 13 ] report bowel wall thicken GvHD patient . But finding unspecific sign gastrointestinal pathology , conventional image technique replace endoscopy biopsy [ 14 ] . The hold video capsule endoscopy indeed find high negative predictive value detection aGI-GvHD , share important shortcoming miss biopsy sample histological evaluation [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] . At least method shift focus interest onto small bowel . Biopsies derive former neglect GI part show high sensitivity GvHD-related change previous study [ 18 ] . As similar result see study site , investigator prospectively compare enteroscopy biopsy present gold standard diagnostic aGI-GvHD management , colonoscopy biopsy . In context investigation large intestine show much strong affection aGI-GvHD location , although pair examination , colonoscopy reveal aGI-GvHD without presence finding enteroscopy . Quite opposite , enteroscopy even reveal GvHD related pathology one case respective colonoscopy remain inconspicuous . Consequently , postulate enteroscopic finding may replace need colonoscopy [ 19 ] , wherefore post-HSCT patient could remain without stressful bowel preparation , often limit rather bad general condition . One late development endoscopic management gastrointestinal tract call confocal laser endomicroscope ( CLE ) . Confocal microscopy develop Marvin Minsky late 1950s . Its principle microscopic scan focal point surface object . In comparison conventional light microscopy use special filter system avoid image overlap surround tissue . In detail , light source ( normally laser ) focus microscope objective lens diffraction limit spot inside object . Light scatter , fluorescence excite ( achieve fluorescein stain , example ) emit , focus sample partially return back optic along path arrive . A beam-splitter place path reflect return light towards detector . The optics focus light focal point specimen conjugate focus near detector ( hence technology term `` con-focal '' ) . Here spatial filter ( `` pinhole '' ) use extinguish light derive area outside focal point . Light reflection focal point forward detector connect computer system digitalise optical signal creates vivo histological image [ 20 ] . Focusing clinical impact , confocal microscopy first technique allow vivo evaluation tissue structure beneath surface . Because many breakthrough miniaturisation ( mostly 1990s ) technology could apply intraluminal use gastroenterology , integrate otherwise standard endoscope . It allow vivo histological visualisation upper 250 micrometer wall within gastrointestinal tract , additionally normal function white light endoscopy ( provide two separate screen top workstation ) [ 20 ] . The first clinical use CLE prospective pilot trial include 35 patient HSCT report Bojarski et al . 2009 . CLE colonic mucosa could predict positive diagnosis aGI-GvHD 14 19 patient , later confirm histological evaluation . The vivo finding aGI-GvHD , vary single crypt apoptosis complete crypt loss , clearly distinguishable pathology origin like infectious colitis ulcerative colitis , use comparative control [ 21 ] . Study Aims In clinical investigation investigator intend continue diagnostic approach acute Gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host Disease ( aGI-GvHD ) . Based recent result study institution ( explain , [ 19 ] ) show remarkable diagnostic yield aGI-GvHD associated pathology small intestine investigator intend evaluate confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) small intestine primary diagnostic procedure patient suspect aGI-GvHD haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . - The investigator aim examine whether early diagnosis aGI-GvHD duodenum jejunum achieve evaluate endomicroscopic feature . - In comparison conventional biopsy mention GI-parts gold standard investigator want test whether marker describe Bojarski et al . colon also hold true small intestine . - Including endomicroscopic result patient celiac disease , enteral infection , inflammatory bowel disease healthy subject controls investigator aim establish aGI-GvHD specific marker use `` biopsy-free '' vivo diagnosis aGI-GvHD . Study Design Prospective clinical pilot trial without randomisation blinding Study Population Patients haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) refer study site clarification one follow symptom : - anorexia - nausea - vomit - abdominal pain - diarrhea - intestinal bleeding To exclude possible side effect condition therapy , GI symptom must occur persisted 20 day respective transplantation date [ 22 ] . Exclusion criterion : - infection CMV HSV - bacterial infection GI tract - medication relate symptom - patient allergic one drug component ( include drug use conscious sedation like propofol midazolam well fluorescein , fluorescent dye use CLE ) - refusal participate study - patient 's age 18 year . Methods This investigation perform Medical University Vienna , Department Internal Medicine III , Division Gastroenterology Hepatology . Patient recruitment achieve close cooperation Department Internal Medicine I , Division Oncology , Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit . As study plan pilot trial , mainly focus qualitative endomicroscopic feature small intestine GvHD-patients yield reference pathology accurate diagnosis future . Nevertheless , quantitative analysis perform compare CLE-derived diagnosis histological result calculate sensitivity specificity CLE-based aGI-GvHD diagnosis small intestine . Considering current diagnostic yield 62 % detection aGI-GvHD symptomatic post-HSCT-patients conventional histology [ 19 ] , investigator estimate include 40 patient suspect aGI-GvHD order discover meaningful sample patient affect aGI-GvHD qualitative quantitative analysis . In comparison , Bojarski et al include 35 patient 19 finally turn suffer aGI-GvHD conventional histology . They could calculate sensitivity 74 % specificity 100 % prediction histological diagnosis CLE [ 21 ] . On basis current frequency post-HSCT-patients study site investigator estimate include aim amount 40 patient within time period 2 year . All patient fulfill list inclusion criterion , receive patient information form study together usual informed consent form respective endoscopic examination undergo . Patient information do least 24 hour intervention , practice unit . If patient agrees participate study he/she prepare endoscopy administration intravenous propofol and/or midazolam routinely use conscious sedation endoscopic procedure department . Additionally , 5-10 ml 10 % solution fluorescein sodium administer intravenously enhance tissue fluorescence endomicroscopy . As far specific CLE-enteroscope available , use CLE-colonoscope ( Pentax EC-3870 CIFK ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax , Tokyo , Japan Optiscan Pty Ltd , Notting Hill , Victoria , Australia ) reach small intestine , comparable enteroscopic procedure ( oral access ) . All drug administer medical specialist , assistant doctor register nurse , routinely practiced institution . CLE picture capture start deep point reachable jejunum . During withdrawal scope CLE picture take every 10 centimetre small bowel , antrum body stomach esophagus . Furthermore , CLE apply distinct look area , suspicious pathologic origin . Wherever CLE picture obtain , conventional biopsy take localisation . CLE picture capture store routinely use standard data management system . They evaluate immediately endoscopic procedure together board certify GI-pathologist , establish initial diagnosis . Conventional biopsy stain Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin , well PAS stain . In-situ hybridization CMV HSV perform exclude viral infection . Classification GvHD do accord McDonald Sale 4 grade , appropriately modify small intestine [ 23 ] : - Grade I : individual cell necrosis - Grade II : crypt abscess - Grade III : drop one ore whole crypt biopsy - Grade IV : total denudation epithelium Endomicroscopic control ( patient celiac disease , enteral infection , inflammatory bowel disease healthy subject ) collect present data endomicroscopic procedure already perform within routine examination . At end study CLE picture histological cut evaluate separately two blind board certify pathologist . In case discordant diagnosis analyse respective case together reach agreement final diagnosis . All case initial final diagnosis deviate re-evaluated together specialist involve . Risk/Benefit assessment GvHD represent major cause morbidity mortality allogeneic HSCT . Approximately 10-40 % patient undergo HSCT develop significant GvHD , half patient die disease therapy result complication [ 1 ] . Endoscopic procedures patient suspect aGI-GvHD well establish . Until histological evaluation GI derive biopsy gold standard tool set accurate aGI-GvHD diagnosis . Endoscopy upper GI-tract comfortable endoscopic assessment low GI-tract need bowel preparation . Therefore primary technique ass post HSCT patient department . Supported recent result study institution [ 19 ] upper GI endoscopy routinely perform enteroscopies instead gastroscopy order include small intestine diagnostic evaluation . The safety enteroscopy study systematically reported experience substantial complication rare [ 24 ] . Confocal laser endomicroscopy safe new technique already study clinical trial [ 25 , 26 ] . Its safety guarantee use low intensity laser light bad cause local bleaching fluorescein contain cell , harmless , reversible even use diagnostic sign experimental condition [ 20 ] . Ethical implication This study protocol approve ethic commission Medical University Vienna . All procedure context study perform accordance Declaration Helsinki well guideline Good Scientific Practice ( GSP ) Medical University Vienna . Expected impact Outlook If investigator find aGI-GvHD specific marker use `` biopsy-free '' vivo diagnosis aGI-GvHD could lead another reduction invasive procedure patient HSCT . This would big clinical impact , biopsy assessment often limited bad coagulation status patient group . In case clearly determine specific marker aGI-GvHD , CLE least reduce amount conventional biopsy need diagnosis take CLE guidance . Despite expect reduction invasive procedure , aGI-GvHD diagnosis vivo could lead immediate initiation immunosuppressive treatment order reduce progression site spread disease . In case study aim support result pilot trial , randomize control trial compare vivo diagnosis conventional histological assessment matter hospitalisation survival perform .</detailed_description>
