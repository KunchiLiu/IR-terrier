	<brief_title>fMRI Appetite-Related Hormones Pre Post Obesity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , effective long term treatment severe obesity bariatric surgery.2 Nearly 200,000 procedure perform year , number increase rapidly.3 However , mechanism reduce food intake weight loss obesity surgery , particularly Rouen-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , well understood . This study utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure appetite-related gut peptide level pre post bariatric surgery investigate neurological hormonal mechanism involve initiation termination meal . The general objective good understand physiological change result weight loss obesity surgery , particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) . The main hypothesis differential mechanisms action RYGB alter signal involve initiation termination meal , reflect change peptide hormone level regional brain activity response food . The investigator anticipate trigger meal initiation potent food stimulus diminish follow RYGB , indicate reduce brain activation area associate food reward motor planning , include orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . RYGB compare : a. Gastric Banding ( GB ) , represent restrictive component surgery , enhance fullness , absence rerouting gut , result few change gut peptide level brain activation ; b . Weight Loss ( WL ) formula diet 3 mo , represent weight loss component surgery ; c. No Treatment ( NT ) , general control , gastric restriction weight loss . These group comparison help parse contribution RYGB surgery weight loss . The plan study clinically severe obese subject ( S 's ) pre surgery , 3 18 mo post surgery . The investigator examine : 1 ) fMRI brain activation response food stimulus 2 ) appetite-related gut peptide level follow fix meal prior fMRI . The finding reveal potential mechanism associate change appetite , eat behavior , body weight , rapid weight loss phase 3 mo post surgery well weight typically stabilize nadir 18 mo post surgery . The investigator plan enroll 160 patient : 40 RYGB , 40 GB , 40 WL , 40 NT ( 4-arm study ) . S 's within BMI range 40-50 match across group BMI , gender ( 3:1 , f : ) , BED status .</detailed_description>
