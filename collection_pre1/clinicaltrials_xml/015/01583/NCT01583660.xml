	<brief_summary>With development society , age population grow . Hip fracture common disease age people . With life longer , incidence disease grow . The mortality disease high—— almost 10 % patient die within 1 month , 1/3 patient die within 12 month . About 20 % -30 % aged people hip fracture die within one year . The damage organ cause excessive inflammatory one possible reason cause high mortality . Therefore , investigator imagine give medicine patient time reduce inflammatory level , inflammatory might less effect organ , recovery could improve . The investigator hypothesis basic research : anti-inflammatory function non steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) inhibit inflammatory level elderly hip fracture , improve recovery level reduce complicate disease mortality . The investigator design clinic study research NSAIDS ' effect inflammatory level prognosis elderly hip fracture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Research Prognostic Influence NSAIDS 's Anti-inflammatory Effect Senior Patients With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With development society , age population grow . The number age people 60 year old reach 130 million . Hip fracture common disease age people . According Britain 's statistical data hip fracture , average age male hip fracture 84 year old , female , 83 year old , female patient account 74 % report case . The disease deadly—— attack almost 10 % patient die within 1 month , 1/3 patient die within 12 month . When senior attack hip fracture , 20 % -30 % die within one year , 25 % recover normal life attack , 55 % patient become disabled different degree . Senile fracture become important issue relate public health , bring huge burden average family . While develop fast , modern society come solution urgent scientific problem . The study show increase inflammatory cytokine senile fracture independent dangerous factor death complication systemic inflammatory response senile fracture cause organ damage may explain senior attack hip fracture likely die peer . Therefore , intend give drug therapy patient early stage attack , reduce inflammatory response body , thus reduce damage body inflammatory response , improve prognosis patient . By inhibit cyclooxygenase COX , turn arachidonic acid ( AA ) 's transformation prostaglandians ( PGs ) thromboxane TXA , NSAIDs produce anti-inflammatory , antipyretic , analgesic anti-rheumatism action . It widely apply clinic . According study , two cyclooxygenase insomers human body namely COX-1 COX-2 . COX-1 , exist normal tissue , physiological stimulation , stimulate arachidonic acid produce thromboxane A , prostaglandin e ( PGE2 ) prostacyclin I2 ( PGI2 ) . It therefore protect gastrointestinal tract , kidney , platelet , vascular endothelial cell , also call structural enzyme . COX-2 type COX induce cytokine produce inflammatory stimulation , COX-2 mediate arachidonic acid produce PGE-2 PGI-2 . As inflammatory prostaglandin , COX-2 inflammation-causing effect pain-causing effect . Its inhibition lay pharmacological foundation antipyretic , analgesic , anti-inflammatory effect NSAIDs Some animal experiment show inhibitor COX-2 reduces inflammatory expression animal model multiple severe trauma enhances survival rate . Recent report suggest inhibitor COX-2 ( parecoxib ) reduce pro inflammatory cytokine traumas , chemokine level relieve acute lung injury . Clinic study show apply inhibitor COX-2 arthroplasty , level systemic inflammatory cytokine reduce , well postoperative function realize . There report treatment inflammatory response NSAID severe trauma . In clinic , pain treatment conventional modern ward become symbol modern ward . In newly publish British NICE clinical guideline hip fracture , pain treatment patient hip fracture point appropriate method . Sufficient pain-treating enable patient take part necessary activity , undergo medical examination , nurse care rehabilitation . N-acethy aminophenol ( paracetamol ) recommend . In case alone application N-acethy aminophenol completely relieve pain , opiate drug add . The guideline recommend NSAIDS since may induce gastrointestinal complication . However , since overcomes side effect gastrointestinal reaction , NSAIDS fundamental drug pain treatment , especially inhibitor COX-2 widely apply treatment trauma pain . But anti-inflammatory effect pay enough attention . Based finding research foundation , wonder besides analgesic effect , whether NSAIDS equally beneficial anti-inflammatory effect excessive inflammatory response patient severe trauma , senior patient hip fracture improve prognosis . Therefore , base fundamental research , assume anti-inflammatory effect NSAIDs relieve systemic inflammatory effect senior patient hip fracture , improve prognosis , reduce incidence complication death . Through prospective clinical experiment , plan study effect NSAIDS change inflammatory factor senior patient hip fracture , prognosis .</detailed_description>
