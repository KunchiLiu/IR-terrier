	<brief_summary>Background : Renal transplant recipient great risk morbidity mortality primarily due cardiovascular disease compare general population . Cardiovascular disease responsible 50 % 60 % percent death amongst renal transplant population death cardiovascular disease lead cause function graft loss . Physical activity effective form secondary prevention exist cardiovascular disease reduce all-cause mortality 25 % -30 % demonstrate positive effect overall quality life well-being . Transplant patient participate regular cardiovascular exercise significant positive score SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire comparison inactive transplant recipient . Active video game evolve innovative method increase physical activity . Active video gaming support physical activity child youth . There however paucity literature examine interactive game mean facilitate physical activity impact CVD quality life adult population literature examine AVG impact adult surgical population . This pilot study design determine Active Video Gaming feasible able lead behavioral modification Quality Life improvement . Subject Selection : This pilot study 10 patient undergone renal transplant select exercise Active Video Gaming duration 3 month . The program activity begin 6 month post surgery .</brief_summary>
