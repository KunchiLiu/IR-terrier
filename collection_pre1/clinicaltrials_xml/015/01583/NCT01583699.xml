	<detailed_description>Introduction Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma ( MZBL ) mucosa associate lymphoid tissue ( MALT-lymphoma ) common form extranodal lymphoma [ 1 , 2 ] . Although MALT-lymphoma may involve different organ , stomach represent site predilection malignant disease . About 90 % gastric MALT-lymphomas associated infection Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) [ 3 ] eradication pathogen lead tumor regression high percentage patient early tumor stage [ 4 , 5 ] . Relapses HP-eradication primary advance tumor stage require chemotherapeutic treatment , radiation therapy , case , surgery [ 6 ] . Following complete remission lifelong follow-up examination perform order detect relapse [ 7 ] . Histologically , MALT-lymphoma characterize infiltration lamina propria lymphomatous centrocyte-like cell spread surround mucosal layer [ 8 ] . In immunohistochemistry show CD 20 positive staining property . When spread lymph node spleen accumulate typically within marginal zone ( reason classify `` marginal zone lymphoma '' ) [ 2 ] . Dissemination organs , especially mucosal site may occur frequently wherefore detailed diagnostics require MALT-lymphoma stag follow-up . Spreading within gastrointestinal tract ( GI-tract ) , small bowel , example , rare , assess easily standard endoscopic procedure recently report department [ 9 ] . For gastric MALT-lymphoma gastroscopy biopsy assessment current follow-up examination choice . Multiple biopsies take randomly gastric site specifically suspicious lesion . Recent development enhancement tissue contrast endoscopic examination ( chromoendoscopy Narrow Band Imaging , example ) help detect MALT-lymphoma lesion . Nevertheless , detection rate hardly change , since technique rely presence superficial feature [ 10 ] . An endoscopic technique allow evaluation deeper wall layer endoscopic ultrasonography . During last year become important amend tool diagnostic management gastric MALT-lymphoma . Although provide essential information tumor infiltration depth lymph node involvement context staging procedure , replace histological assessment follow-up , since endosonographic finding show good correlation histological result time [ 11 , 12 ] . The new development introduce endoscopic management gastrointestinal tract call confocal laser endomicroscope ( CLE ) . Confocal microscopy develop Marvin Minsky late 1950s . Its principle microscopic scan focal point surface object . In comparison conventional light microscopy use special filter system avoid image overlap surround tissue . In detail , light source ( normally laser ) focus microscope objective lens diffraction limit spot inside object . Light scatter , fluorescence excite ( achieve fluorescein stain , example ) emit , focus sample partially return back optic along path arrive . A beam-splitter place path reflect return light towards detector . The optics focus light focal point specimen conjugate focus near detector ( hence technology term `` con-focal '' ) . Here spatial filter ( `` pinhole '' ) use extinguish light derive area outside focal point . Light reflection focal point forward detector connect computer system digitalise optical signal creates vivo histological image [ 13 ] . Focusing clinical impact , confocal microscopy first technique allow vivo evaluation tissue structure beneath surface . Because many breakthrough miniaturisation ( mostly 1990s ) technology could apply intraluminal use gastroenterology , integrate otherwise standard endoscope . It allow vivo histological visualisation upper 250 micrometer wall within gastrointestinal tract , additionally normal function white light endoscopy ( provide two separate screen top workstation ) [ 13 ] . The vivo visualisation different GI-pathologies lead first publication clinical use CLE . Kiesslich et al. , one pioneer technique , publish case live imaging Helicobacter pylorus CLE stomach [ 14 ] . At department recently report endomicroscopic finding patient Whipple 's disease . Detecting foamy macrophage within lamina propria clearly distinguishable goblet cell surround CLE could provide vivo histology single cell level [ 15 ] . Assessing GI-pathologies systematically many publication deal use CLE context follow-up examination condition predispose development malignancy . For Barrett 's oesophagus , example , Kiesslich et al . find high sensitivity specificity rate detection Barrett 's metaplasia well prediction Barrett 's associate neoplastic change - result CLE derive picture compare conventional histology [ 16 ] . In first prospective , randomize , double-blind , control , crossover trial Dunbar et al . proved finding , CLE-targeted biopsy higher diagnostic yield Barrett 's oesophagus associate neoplasia standard endoscopy 4-quadrant random biopsy [ 17 ] . Similar result already publish patient ulcerative colitis routinely screen colon cancer . It could show CLE useful tool improve diagnostic yield . At time , help take conventional biopsy accurately , spare patient unnecessary biopsy [ 18 ] . Combining potential CLE improve diagnostic yield surveillance property scan upper 250Âµm GI-wall ( equates nearly whole depth mucosa ) make ideal tool diagnostic management gastric MALT-lymphoma , pathologies typically arise lamina propria , deep layer mucosa [ 8 ] . Study Aims In clinical pilot study investigator aim examine patient gastric MALT-lymphoma confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) context stag follow-up endoscopy . To knowledge systematic study use CLE MALT-lymphoma patient yet perform . - The investigator aim determine whether diagnosis MALT-lymphoma achieve evaluate endomicroscopic feature suspicious lesion stomach small bowel , GI-parts easily accessible upper endoscopy . Conventional biopsy GI-parts observe serve comparable gold standard . - Including endomicroscopic result patient chronic gastritis , gastric adenocarcinoma healthy subject control investigator aim establish MALT-lymphoma specific marker use `` biopsy-free '' vivo diagnosis disease . Study Design Prospective clinical trial without randomisation blinding Study Population Patients refer department upper endoscopy context stag follow-up gastric MALT-lymphoma . Exclusion criterion : - patient allergic one drug component ( include drug use conscious sedation like propofol midazolam well fluorescein , fluorescent dye use CLE ) - refusal participate study - patient 's age 18 year Methods This investigation perform Division Gastroenterology Hepatology , Department Internal Medicine III. , close cooperation Division Oncology , Department Internal Medicine I. Clinical Institute Pathology Medical University Vienna . As study plan pilot trial , mainly focus qualitative endomicroscopic feature draw examination yield reference pathology accurate diagnosis future . Nevertheless , quantitative analysis perform compare CLE-derived diagnosis histological result calculate sensitivity specificity CLE base MALT-lymphoma diagnosis . Based current incidence relapse rate disease investigator estimate include 50 patient order get meaningful patient sample qualitative quantitative analysis . Given current number MALT-lymphoma patient undergo stag follow-up endoscopy investigational site , patient sample include within period two year . All patient fulfill list inclusion criterion , receive patient information form study together usual informed consent form respective endoscopic examination undergo . Patient information do least 24 hour intervention , practise unit . If patient agrees participate study prepared endoscopy confocal laser endomicroscope ( Pentax EC3870K ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax , Tokyo , Japan Optiscan Pty Ltd , Notting Hill , Victoria , Australia ) administration intravenous propofol and/or midazolam routinely use conscious sedation endoscopic procedure department . Additionally , 5-10 ml 10 % solution fluorescein sodium administer intravenously enhance tissue fluorescence endomicroscopy . All drug administer medical specialist , assistant doctor register nurse , routinely practiced institution . CLE picture capture start deep point reachable small bowel . During withdrawal scope CLE picture take every 10 centimetre small bowel , antrum body stomach esophagus . Furthermore , CLE apply distinct look area , suspicious pathologic origin . Wherever CLE picture obtain , conventional biopsy take localisation . CLE picture capture store routinely use standard data management system . They evaluate immediately endoscopic procedure together board certify GI-pathologist , establish initial diagnosis . Conventional biopsy process evaluate accord criterion outline recent WHO-classification MALT-lymphoma . In patient , immunologic phenotyping paraffin section do demonstration light chain restriction phenotype CD20+CD5-CD10-cyclinD1- , context microscopic appearance , consistent MALT-lymphoma . In addition , patient assess MALT-lymphoma specific translocation , especially ( 11 ; 18 ) ( q21 ; q21 ) . Endomicroscopic control ( patient chronic gastritis , gastric adenocarcinoma healthy subject ) collect present data endomicroscopic procedure already perform within routine examination . At end study CLE picture histological cut evaluate separately two blind board certify pathologist . In case discordant diagnosis analyse respective case together reach agreement final diagnosis . All case initial final diagnosis deviate re-evaluated together specialist involve . Ethical implication Confocal laser endomicroscopy safe new technique already study clinical trial [ 16 , 17 ] . Its safety guarantee use low intensity laser light bad cause local bleaching fluorescein contain cell , harmless , reversible even use diagnostic sign experimental condition [ 13 ] . This study protocol already approve ethic commission Medical University Vienna . All procedure context study perform accordance Declaration Helsinki well guideline Good Scientific Practice ( GSP ) Medical University Vienna . Expected impact Outlook If investigator find MALT-lymphoma specific marker use `` biopsy-free '' vivo diagnosis , could lead another reduction invasive procedure affect patient may important clinical impact , biopsy assessment often limit rather bad coagulation status oncologic patient . In case study aim support result pilot trial , randomize control trial compare vivo diagnosis conventional histological assessment matter diagnostic yield perform .</detailed_description>
