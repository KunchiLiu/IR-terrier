	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : High volume saline injection effective pain relieve treatment people longstanding pain achilles tendon improved physiotherapy programme . Objective 1 : To establish whether high volume saline injection effective treatment decrease pain people achilles tendinopathy Objective 2 : To investigate whether high volume saline injection improve day day functioning , quality life ultrasound appearance tendon people achilles tendinopathy Objective 3 : To assess tolerability procedure level patient satisfaction use simple questionnaire . Objective 4 : To follow cohort people receive injection 9 month ascertain whether benefit persist , symptom recur . Background : Achilles tendon disorder common problem athlete lifetime risk around 50 % . They also common less active people lifetime risk around 6 % . Tendinopathy condition characterise pain , difficulty weight bear swell tendon . Symptoms may occur exercise first progress occur rest interfere day day activity . When problematic tendon examine microscope , usually show sign degeneration rather inflammation - especially symptoms persistent . An ultrasound scan usually show tendon swollen increase water content disorganise tendon structure . A special type ultrasound scan look fluid flow , call doppler ultrasound , often show area increase blood flow around tendon . Studies show area increase blood flow present , patient tends experience pain stiffness tendon . Under microscope , blood vessel often accompany nerve fibre suggest newly grow nerve ending responsible persistent pain patient experience . There robust evidence particular type exercise programme ( eccentric loading ) effective treatment achilles tendinopathy . These exercise involve take weight tendon whilst compress rather stretch - heel lowering exercise . Nevertheless complete 3 month eccentric loading exercise programme , around 24-45 % patient still symptom . There clear consensus amongst doctor best second line treatment try group people . A number different treatment describe research literature try treat group people persistent symptom , although firm conclusion reach . There 2 small trial high volume saline injection show promising potential treatment . The aim injection destroy blood vessel nerve ending grow swollen tendon reduce pain allow people move exercise normally use tendon . These study simply look injection result compare injection placebo treatment . The aim project conduct high quality comparison new type injection common steroid local anaesthetic injection around tendon sheath . The design trial double blind , randomise control trial . This mean neither patient , doctor collect data pain score know treatment participant give , allow fair comparison intervention . The main comparison 2 group take place 6 week follow appointment . Once outcome measure record blind assessor , participant tell arm study . If previously receive control injection ( steroid local anaesthetic ) still symptom , stage offer high volume saline injection well . The investigator follow study participant 9 month ascertain whether people show persistent benefit treatment , whether symptom subsequently return . The full study protocol available request Principle Investigator , along information leaflet , ethical approval etc .</brief_summary>
