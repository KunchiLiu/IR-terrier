	<brief_summary>The pilot study evaluate whether electronic-Measurement Based Care ( e-MBC ) use UT Southwestern MyChart personal health record feasible , associate patient health care team satisfaction , improve treatment outcome compare standard treatment model . The project conduct Simmons Cancer Center Clinic University Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas collaborative effort Departments Psychiatry , Oncology , Family Community Medicine . The primary patient population include adult significant depression and/or start antidepressant treatment and/or experience treatment change . The study compare two group , e-MBC group office-based standard care MBC group . Study staff explain study patient , specifically explain study participant receive either office-based MBC e-MBC . Eligible participant must willing receive either form treatment monitoring . Participating patient randomly assign receive either e-MBC office-based MBC . In e-MBC group month study nurse send prompt participate patient treat physician request patient use MyChart system fill-out MBC scale . Beyond monthly assessment , patient encourage utilize MyChart MBC assessment ( e-MBC ) time communicate physician . Patients experience difficulty use e-MBC system give additional instruction study nurse . Patients physician train use eMBC system . In office-based MBC group study nurse schedule monthly treatment visit request patient call need report symptom . The evaluation period 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic-Measurement Based Care Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) serious , debilitate illness affect person age , race , socioeconomic background . Despite availability new effective treatment last 20 year , recent evidence continue demonstrate high rate inadequate antidepressant medication treatment practice setting . Practitioners vary widely assess treatment outcome , include symptom , function , side-effect frequency burden . In contrast chronic medical condition diabetes mellitus , back/neck problem , hypertension , clinician treat patient depression routinely evaluate measurement-based care ( MBC ) treatment parameter . MBC provide essential framework physician approach depression treatment consistent approach common disorder . MBC effective mean provide patient-centered care MDD , personalize treatment decision base patient progress ability tolerate medication . A key barrier patient adherence MBC treatment approach require patient return clinic several follow-up visit . The necessity treatment visit varies widely among patient . Thus far , physician use MBC treatment MDD complete set tool practical use allow treatment truly personalize patient-centered care . One solution problem use enhance electronic personal health record , MyChart system . This system could easily modify include central element MBC depression allow systematic assessment patient 's depressive symptom severity , antidepressant tolerability , adherence treatment timely fashion . This information would available allow physician provide patient-centered care utilize standardized assessment personalize treatment depression . The propose electronic-MBC ( e-MBC ) address critical gap depression treatment provide regularly-scheduled drug monitoring continuity care , face limit patient clinic resource . Information technology ( IT ) system effectively integrated medical treatment patient yet substantial impact point-of-care . Applying e-MBC method allows physician utilize exist information technology system improve depression treatment point-of-care . The key feature propose e-MBC approach seamlessly integrated standard clinical practice , require additional IT knowledge train effectively utilized physician clinical staff . In pilot study investigator compare standard treatment ( office base antidepressant management ) group receive schedule electronic MBC assessment via enhanced personal health record system ( e-MBC ) . To date , one publish feasibility study evaluate use personal health record measurement-based care depression patient .</detailed_description>
