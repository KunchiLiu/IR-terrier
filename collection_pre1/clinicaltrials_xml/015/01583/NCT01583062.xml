	<detailed_description>Background While early 1980 's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis maxillofacial surgery controversial efficacy well accept today . Chole et al . show administration antibiotic reduces incidence infectious complication facial fracture 42,2 % 8.9 % . However still consensus duration postoperative administration . In literature postoperative prophylaxis varies single-shot 7 even ten day postoperatively . Antibiotic use costly associate allergic reaction , toxic reaction , adverse effect , drug interaction increase bacterial resistance . Additionally author assume prolonged administration antibiotic might even increase risk infectious complication via superinfection . On hand one might risk increase postoperative infection short term single shot administration . In medline search study could find deal antimicrobial prophylaxis maxillofacial surgery facial trauma surgery particular . Articles advocate single shot administration contain inhomogeneous group patient . Merten et al . compare single shot 48h regimen . The study include cleft patient , tumor resection , dental surgery , sinus revision , plastic surgery trauma . He conclude one shot administration 1500mg cefuroxime equally effective 48h regimen . The second study investigate efficacy single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis include preprosthetic , plastic , orthognathic , tumor trauma surgery . Here also single shot administration find sufficient prevent postoperative infection . Studies antibiotic single shot administration include trauma patient exist . Some study compare 12 24 hour 5 day postoperative regime : Johnson et al . conduct study one hundred nine patient require pedicled flap reconstruction region head neck . He investigate 5 day antibiotic administration would effective 1 day conclude beneficial effect administration antibiotic longer 24 hour postoperatively achieve patient undergo myocutaneous flap reconstruction . Bentley et al . studied effect infection rate 1-day 5-day administration prophylactic antibiotic orthognathic surgical procedure . He conclude antibiotic prophylaxis orthognathic surgical procedure continue beyond immediate postoperative period 5 day since infection rate significantly high one day regimen ( 60 % vs. 6.7 % ) . It must state study strict criterion wound infection ( spontaneous wound dehiscence absence pu drainage ) apply . Abubaker et al . evaluate difference effect 5-day postoperative course 12 hour administration antibiotic 30 Patients incidence postoperative infection uncomplicated fracture mandible . He conclude prolonged administration antibiotic benefit reduce incidence infection . In surgical field guideline concern perioperative antibiotic use establish . The East practice management guideline example recommend limit postoperative administration open fracture 48 hour wound closure . Unfortunately guideline uncritically apply maxillofacial trauma patient several reason . Not fracture pattern basically different orthopedics also surgical treatment differs many aspect : impossibility complete wound disinfection , continue contamination saliva even primary closure , lack cast sterile wound dressing , impossibility extensive wound debridement open wound treatment . Pharmaceutical study substance : Co-amoxiclav antibacterial combination consist semisynthetic antibiotic amoxicillin ß-lactamase inhibitor , clavulanate potassium . It introduce `` Augmentin® '' 1984 Glaxosmithkline Smithkline Beecham ( collectively `` GSK '' ) . Since patent expire december 2002 several generic version approve . It use treatment lower respiratory , middle ear , sinus , skin urinary tract infection . In ENT maxillofacial surgery use prophylaxis therapy several indication . In investigator ' department present prophylaxis regimen facial fracture vary 5 8 day postoperatively . Objective Aim study evaluate difference effect five- vs. one-day postoperative course antibiotic incidence postoperative infection facial fracture . Methods Patients facial fracture , need surgical revision , randomly assign two group . Both group receive amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.2 g intravenously every eight hour admission 24 hour postoperatively . Group A receive amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 625 mg orally every eight hour four day . Group B receive oral placebo use schedule duration group A . Follow appointments 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 12 week 6 month surgery . The developement surgical site infection ( accord CDC ) define primary end point .</detailed_description>
