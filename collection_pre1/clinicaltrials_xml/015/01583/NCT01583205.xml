	<brief_summary>The investigator propose adapt pilot test behavioral intervention recently diagnose patient Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) , and/or family care partner . ALS fatal neurodegenerative disease , diagnosis devastate impact patient family . Our eight session intervention derive Coping Effectiveness Training , manualized intervention base stress cop theory . It design strengthen cop skill alleviate distress follow diagnosis . Participants ( patient and/or care partner ) recruit Eleanor Lou Gehrig MDA/ALS Research Center , Columbia University . The main outcome change distress level , depression anxiety symptom , cop self-efficacy . Once investigator gain preliminary experience manual , get sense feasibility acceptance , learn patient care partner reaction , investigator well able prepare grant application seek NIH support development intervention , eventual goal multisite randomize control trial ( RCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coping Effectiveness Training ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALS rare , devastate , fatal neurodegenerative disease largely unknown cause . Average survival diagnosis 3 year . The diagnostic process often protract , even though possibility ALS may mention early , diagnosis confirm , patient family member often shock overwhelmed . After diagnostic visit , patient ( accompany family member ) commonly schedule return clinic office 3 6 month . At first routine clinic visit , focus generally assessment management mobility issue , diet , occupational adjustment , advance planning directive , insurance coverage press issue usually take allotted time . Thus , often little opportunity address emotional impact diagnosis visit . Our goal manualized intervention suitable telephone Skype delivery , management distress enhancement cop skill among recently diagnose ALS patient and/or family care partner . We adapt intervention develop Chesney , Folkman colleague , `` Coping Effectiveness Training , '' salient theoretically powerful design purpose . We base work Folkman 's revise model incorporate meaning-focused cop importance positive emotion , addition original model problem-focused emotion-focused coping . The course ALS entail progressive loss , mobility , fine gross motor skill , speech , swallow , respiration . Each require recalibrating emotional response cop new challenge . Early intervention strengthen cop skill may equip patient care partner handle new challenge arise , although initial study follow patient long enough observe long-term effect , present . Based successful finding pilot study , next step conduct large RCT intervention . Specific Aims Hypotheses AIM 1 . To adapt refine manual Coping Effectiveness Training recently diagnose ALS patient care partner ( CET-ALS ) base Coping Effectiveness Training ( CET ) . We seek input interview patient ( know participation ongoing study ) , care partner ALS clinic staff . AIM 2 . Feasibility Acceptability : Evaluate acceptability , attrition , participant satisfaction perceive barrier facilitator intervention delivery .</detailed_description>
