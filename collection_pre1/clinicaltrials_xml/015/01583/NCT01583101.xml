	<brief_summary>The investigator develop novel decision support system implement clinical guideline pediatric practice . CHICA ( Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ) combine three element : ( 1 ) pediatric guideline encode Arden Syntax ; ( 2 ) dynamic , scannable paper user interface ; ( 3 ) HL7-compliant interface exist electronic medical record system . The result system deliver `` just-in-time '' patient-relevant guideline physician clinical encounter , accurately capture structure data interact . Preliminary work CHICA demonstrate feasibility use system implement evaluate clinical guideline . However , analyse show physician ignore fair number prompt . The investigator would like experiment change system see increase physician ' response rate . This could include highlight prompt , reorder , flag way . The main outcome interest rate physician answer prompt .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation ( CHICA ) Highlighting Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We develop novel decision support system implement clinical guideline pediatric practice . CHICA ( Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ) combine three element : ( 1 ) pediatric guideline encode Arden Syntax ; ( 2 ) dynamic , scannable paper user interface ; ( 3 ) HL7-compliant interface exist electronic medical record system . The result system deliver `` just-in-time '' patient-relevant guideline physician clinical encounter , accurately capture structure data interact . Preliminary work CHICA demonstrate feasibility use system implement evaluate clinical guideline . However , analyse show physician ignore fair number prompt . We would like experiment change system see increase physician ' response rate . This could include highlight prompt , reorder , flag way . The main outcome interest rate physician answer prompt . This randomize , control trial CHICA system see improve prompt response rate . We randomize physician clinic receive form prompt change , include highlighting , reorder , flag . No change make care . We extract data CHICA system patient see study clinic . This data include clinic location , whether physician respond prompt , prompt 's position form , patient 's gender , rule priority prompt , rule title , patient insurance category , patient 's age day , name provider . The main outcome interest whether prompt answer ( discussed/not discuss ) .</detailed_description>
