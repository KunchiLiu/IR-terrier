	<brief_summary>Current guideline AGO-Breast commission recommend neoadjuvant breast cancer patient either sequence 4 cycle EC follow 4 cycle taxane 6 cycle TAC base previous large scale study . Treatment patient HER2-positive disease include also simultaneous application trastuzumab . Solvent-based taxanes ( paclitaxel , docetaxel ) cause severe toxicity active agent also solvent like cremophor . Nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) solvent-free formulation paclitaxel encapsulate albumin . It require premedication corticosteroid antihistamines prevent risk solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reaction . This new formulation improve safety profile , allow high dose short infusion duration , produce high tumor drug concentration . As neoadjuvant treatment allow compare compete treatment approach high quality ( homogenous treatment population , precise assessment response histological assessment ) , also identify predictive marker , trial compare weekly nab-paclitaxel solvent-based paclitaxel currently optimal dos . In case HER2-positive tumor status patient receive Pertuzumab Trastuzumab additionally .</brief_summary>

Objectives Substudies : - To assess , characterize , correlate circulate tumor cell proteins effect treatment ( CTC Substudy ) . - To correlate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) gene associate toxicity histologically assessed treatment effect ( Pharmacogenetic substudy ) - To assess ovarian function measure amenorrhea rate correlation change E2 , FSH , LH , Anti-Müller Hormone , ultrasound-follicle count patient age &lt; 45 year .</detailed_description>
