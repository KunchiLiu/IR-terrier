	<brief_summary>In study investigator specifically target Latina woman likely inactive , therefore , high risk develop chronic condition like obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease . Through focus group cognitive interview Latinas Providence area , investigator modify print-based intervention , already test proven effective English-speaking community , culturally linguistically appropriate Latina community . The objective Seamos Saludables determine whether culturally tailor print intervention produce great increase physical activity level among Latina woman program focus general health topic . Participants randomly assign one two group ( exercise general wellness ) attend 4 clinic visit complete baseline follow-up assessment . The investigator hypothesize end treatment , intervention participant report significantly minute least moderate intensity physical activity per week wellness contact control participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In U.S. , Latinos report high rate inactivity relate health condition ( e.g. , hypertension , hypercholesteremia , obesity , heart disease , stroke , diabetes ) non-Hispanic white . Furthermore , Latino woman ( Latinas ) report high rate sedentary behavior Latino men . Due cultural factor , socioeconomic circumstance , difference educational background , language barrier , Latinos general , especially Latinas , limited access public health intervention promote physically active lifestyle . To address public health crisis , effective intervention leverage state-of-the-art theory method need . The investigator research group 20 year experience develop evaluate individually tailor computer expert system-driven physical activity intervention ( base Social Cognitive Theory Transtheoretical Model ) . In investigator recent pilot study ( R21NR009864 ) , investigator culturally linguistically adapt exist tailor intervention sedentary Latinas conduct small randomized trial modify program ( N=94 ) . Six month ( post-intervention ) assessment still ongoing , three month data collect 87 participant ( 93 % retention ) . Intervention participant increase physical activity mean 17 minute per week ( SD=25.8 ) baseline 92 minute ( SD=69.8 ) three month , whereas contact control participant report increase physical activity 12 minute per week ( SD=21.8 ) baseline 64 minute ( SD=84.3 ) three month . The trend mean 3 month lend preliminary support efficacy intervention high retention rate , especially study target hard-to-reach group like Latinas , bode well feasibility acceptability . For current proposal , investigator build encouraging result conduct adequately power ( N=312 ) randomize control trial test efficacy culturally linguistically modify , individually tailor print intervention compare wellness contact control condition ( e.g. , cardiovascular health information NHLBI Spanish ) . Data collect baseline , 6 , 12 month use well-established physical activity measure ( 7-Day PAR , Actigraphs ) , well comprehensive set psychosocial questionnaire . The investigator hypothesize end treatment , intervention participant report significantly minute least moderate intensity physical activity per week wellness contact control participant . The investigator also examine maintenance treatment effect 12 month , cost deliver tailored intervention program , potential mediator moderator intervention-physical activity relationship . In proposed study investigator seek promote physical activity among at-risk population use high-reach , low-cost strategy , great potential adoption large scale thus high potential reduce exist health disparity U.S .</detailed_description>
