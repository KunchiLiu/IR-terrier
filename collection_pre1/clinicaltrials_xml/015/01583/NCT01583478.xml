	<brief_summary>The objective study compare efficacy duration escalate dos IncobotulinumtoxinA ( Xeomin® ) treatment glabellar rhytids ( frown line eye ) . Fifteen subject enrol study ; specifically 60 male female patient 18 year age old moderate severe glabellar rhytids maximum contracture . Each patient randomize receive one 5 dos Xeomin® , one-time dose treatment area . The efficacy endpoint determine investigator subject live assessment glabellar rhytids rest maximum contraction visit ( every day 6 day post-injection , every month 9 month follow ) use validate 4 point photographic scale ( minimal wrinkle [ 0 ] , mild wrinkle [ 1 ] , moderate wrinkle [ 2 ] , severe wrinkle [ 3 ] ) use previous study .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Previously FDA-approved Botulinum type A toxin utilized upper face treat glabellar rhytids nearly two decade . Botox® Cosmetic ( Allergan , Irvine , CA ) , first FDA-approved Botulinum toxin type A approve United States treatment glabellar rhytids . Its efficacy safety proven multiple study . Approximately two year ago , Dysport® ( Medicis , Scottsdale , AZ ) also receive FDA approval treatment dynamic glabellar rhytids . While product market Europe two decade , use United States cosmetic application past ten year . Xeomin® ( Merz Pharmaceuticals , Frankfurt , Germany ) , first , obtain FDA approval treatment cervical dystonia blepharospasm - two application previous two botulinum type A toxin ( onabotulinumtoxinA abobotulinumtoxinA ) initially receive prior cosmetic approval . More recently , Xeomin® approve cosmetic use . This study aim assess efficacy vary dos incobotulinumtoxinA treatment glabellar rhytids . Background Cosmetic procedure increase demand reverse appearance advance age , particularly procedure improve appearance age face . Noninvasive procedure little downtime offer significant improvement age appearance skin underlying musculature often preferred procedure surgical option . Although procedure entirely risk free , continue research require provide safe efficacious approach aesthetic procedure treat age face . Although five factor contribute appearance age face,1 two anatomical unit influence appearance facial rhytids : skin underlying musculature . Many therapy evolve treat rhytids include resurfacing , topical preparation , soft tissue injectable filler , lastly , botulinum toxin . Relaxation facial musculature routinely accomplish cosmetic use use Clostridium botulinum type A ( BoNT-A ) . Clostridium botulinum type A toxin reduces recruitment specific muscle group . Many study publish peer-reviewed medical journal regard cosmetic use biologic.2-11 Clostridium botulinum form Botox® Cosmetic ( onabotulinumtoxinA ) FDA-approved cosmetic use treatment rhytids glabellar region . Dysport® ( abobotulinumtoxinA ) use similarly treat glabellar region receive FDA approval 2009 . Xeomin® ( incobotulinumtoxinA ) receive FDA approval October 2010 treatment cervical dystonia blepharospasm , use globally since 2005 . Several study note efficacy clinical applications.12-16 More recently , Xeomin® ( incobotulinumtoxinA ) obtain FDA approval July 2011 cosmetic use . Its maker employ manufacture process isolate active protein eliminate accessory protein present formulation . Many study demonstrate effect botulinum toxin facial rhytids produce underlie coordinate muscle group . Those glabellar area , upper forehead , low forehead , periocular perinasal area particularly well-documented . Previous report Dysport® Botox® Cosmetic medication show effective relaxation glabellar rhytids injection.12-17 Xeomin® generally well-tolerated , although side effect may occur , temporary paralysis adjacent muscle group close inject , may due local spread toxin injection site /or misplace injection . Most side effect mild moderate severity , limited duration . The common adverse event ( AE ) see follow use Dysport® , Botox® Cosmetic Xeomin® treatment blepharospasm ptosis . Some patient report diplopia symptom result spread effect mid-facial muscle . Other AEs report injection site reaction , skin rash , influenza-like symptom , dry eye , tear , bruising , eyelid swelling . Reversible ophthalmoplegia report excessive dosing . Studies show safety high dos botulinum toxin type A treatment spasticity hyperhydrosis child adults dos range 400 upwards 1200 unit single-dose injection.18,19 No clinical study conduct North America determine optimal dose Xeomin® cosmetic use glabellar area . Though manufacturer Xeomin® purport 1:1 dosage ratio Botox® Cosmetic , conversion demonstrate proven facial cosmetic application . This study intend compare vary dos incobotulinumtoxinA treatment glabellar rhytids assess dosage optimal term efficacy duration action . Investigational Agents Xeomin® supply 100 unit vial Clostridium botulinum type A exotoxin , sterilely prepared vacuum-dried without preservative . Dose Rationale Risk/Benefits : Administration Eligible patient receive Xeomin® dos escalating-units divide among 5 injection point ( 0.25 mL total ) glabellar region Day 0 study , describe instruction section . For Study Purposes : For study purpose , one injection session perform Day 0 study . Subsequent follow-up visit monitor effect single injection session time 0 . Packaging , Labeling , Storage Commercially-available active drug ( Xeomin® ) vial , bear unique lot number , obtain Merz Pharmaceuticals . Study medication may maintain transit storage within temperature range 20o 25o C , refrigerate within temperature range 2o 8o C frozen within temperature range -20o -10o C. Drug accountability The investigator administer study medication patient include study follow procedure set study protocol . Each dispense document CRFs study medication dispense log . Concomitant Medications Treatments Any medication patient take study medication specify protocol consider concomitant medication . This apply prescription over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug , herbal supplement , whether take systemically apply topically . In addition , treatment patient receive study medication consider concomitant treatment . This apply cosmetic treatment face neck area . All concomitant medication concomitant treatment must record CRFs . Prohibited medication class treatment describe `` Exclusion Criteria '' . In event prohibit treatment ( e.g . microdermabrasion , Intense Pulse Light , light-emitting diode , radio-frequency ) receive , must document CRFs . Study Objectives Primary Objective : To compare efficacy escalate dos Xeomin® treatment glabellar rhytids . Secondary Objective : To assess duration action escalate dos Xeomin® treatment glabellar rhytids . Secondary Objective : To determine safety presence adverse effect Xeomin® treatment glabellar rhytids . Study Design General Design - Phase IV , single-center , prospective , open-label study . - 60 subject moderate severe glabellar rhytids . - 12 month duration - 16 Visits : Visit 0 Screening/Baseline ( treatment ) , Visit 1 follow-up ( day 1 ) , Visit 2 follow-up ( day 4 ) , Visit 3 follow-up ( day 7 ) , Visit 4 ( day 30 ) , Visit 5 ( day 60 ) , Visit 6 ( day 90 ) , Visit 7 ( day 120 ) , Visit 8 ( day 150 ) , Visit 9 ( day 180 ) , Visit 10 ( day 210 ) , Visit 11 ( day 240 ) , Visit 12 ( day 270 ) , Visit 13 ( day 300 ) , Visit 14 ( day 330 ) , Visit 15 ( day 360 ) . If patient assess returned baseline visit prior Visit 15 , see next two sequential follow-up visit allow possible variation assessment adverse event . Primary Study Endpoints Efficacy duration endpoint determine : - The investigator 's live assessment glabellar rhytids maximum contraction rest . Secondary adverse event endpoint determine : - The patient 's assessment symptom experience follow-up visit record CRF .</detailed_description>
