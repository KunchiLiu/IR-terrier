	<brief_title>Structured Physical Activity Sleep Quality Daytime Sleepiness Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) chronic , progressive , neurodegenerative disease affect 1 % elderly people . Sleep disturbance affect 88 % patient PD commonly include sleep fragmentation excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) ; symptom significantly impair quality life . The cause sleep fragmentation EDS likely multifactorial , include medication , neurodegeneration , primary sleep disorder sleep apnea , decreased physical activity . Pharmacotherapy population limit due side effect drug-drug interaction . The goal project develop non-pharmacologic therapy impair sleep quality EDS PD . Sleep disturbance EDS common among patient PD negatively affect quality life . There data support role physical activity sleep older adult without insomnia . Additionally , increase physical activity patient PD associate improvement PD motor symptom quality life . Therefore , investigator propose examine ability structure physical activity improve sleep quality daytime sleepiness patient PD . The overall objective propose project develop behavioral approach improve sleep quality daytime function PD . The investigator propose examine effect structure physical activity program sleep hygiene education nighttime sleep quality EDS patient idiopathic PD . There two group : 1 ) structure physical activity program sleep hygiene education ( SPA group ) , 2 ) control group receive sleep hygiene education ( SH group ) offer delayed physical activity program . The investigator hypothesize structured physical activity program improve subjective objective sleep quality daytime sleepiness compare sleep hygiene education alone .</detailed_description>
