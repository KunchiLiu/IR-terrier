	<brief_summary>Genetics nutrition clearly affect risk Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) elderly . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE4 ) important know genetic risk AD prevalent 20-25 % Canadians , present , know individual 's ApoE genotype help diagnosis , treatment prevention AD . Furthermore , fish intake contain docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , 22:6 omega-3 ) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA , 20:5 omega-3 ) may incorporate prevention strategy lower risk AD . However , fish intake seem protect APOE4 carrier develop AD . One explanation APOE4 carrier may benefit fish intake potentially link imbalance omega-3 fatty acid metabolism . The investigator recently report 3g/d EPA+DHA 6 week , increase two fatty acid le carrier result significant gene-by-diet interaction . ApoE component lipoproteins ApoE genotype modulate fast lipoprotein response fish-oil supplementation . Therefore , investigator hypothesis APOE4 genotype associate imbalance lipoprotein concentration consequence associate imbalance EPA DHA transport . The investigator recruit test 100 healthy young adult since old age carrier ApoE4 usually take medication alter lipoprotein profile . They receive EPA + DHA supplement one month . This period choose 3 class lipoprotein ( VLDL , LDL HDL ) different concentration TG , phospholipid cholesteryl ester fully investigate lipoprotein fatty acid change , one month supplementation need change EPA DHA lipid class . The investigator monitor distribution EPA DHA lipoproteins one month supplementation fish oil investigator separate investigator group APOE4 carrier non-carriers .</brief_summary>
