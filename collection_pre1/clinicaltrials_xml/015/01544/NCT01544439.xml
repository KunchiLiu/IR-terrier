	<brief_title>Occlusal Splint Counseling Temporomandibular Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The aim double-blind randomize control trial evaluate efficacy occlusal stabilization appliance associate counsel management myofascial pain chronic improvement quality life patient temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . - In order reduce likelihood systematic error allow use statistical test use randomization process randomization volunteer different group sequence generate specific program ( Randomization.com ) , principal investigator mask division . For , second researcher , appoint undertake division patient group maintain confidential information group participant , reveal researcher therapist time first therapy session . The number individual randomize experimental group equal control group . 1 . Study Group Intervention The reversible occlusal therapy stabilize appliance use patient Study Group shall make dental technician adjust dentist , therapist represent researcher . Will play simultaneous occlusal contact centric relation position malocclusion canine protrusive guide . The patient assess weekly interval ( query follow board installation ) biweekly period 90 day . There shall gradual reduction daily use plate , first two week device indicate 24 hour day , remove eat cleaning . At visit clinical follow-up , shall establish gradual reduction time use last three week treatment achieve 8h/day use . 2 . Control Group Intervention The non-occlusive splint ( placebo ) also make dental technician . They differ plate interfere occlusal tooth gear , i.e. , alter position closing jaw . As lead acrylic occlusal surface teeth , adequate retention give arch wire orthodontic buccal surface teeth . They adjust base verification occlusion , card interfere movement maximum intercuspation excursive lateral protrusion , patient 's teeth come contact , without interference resin acrylic staple . The assessment patient occur interval recommend patient experimental group establish treatment protocol respect daily use plate . - In study , patient ( study control group ) undergo counsel approach/self-care . Patients receive oral write instruction self-care , include , addition instruction condition TMD explanation possible factor contribute etiology . The program also include self-care guideline use moist heat ice , use soft diet , reduction parafunctional habit ( clench grind teeth chew gum ) , hold rest postural position jaw ( teeth apart , lip tongue touch slightly push front teeth ) , perform simultaneous bilateral chew modify posture sleep . This approach reinforce verbally subsequent session .</detailed_description>
