	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study compare efficacy two boceprevir ( BOC ) -containing therapeutic regimen treatment naïve participant chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 1 IL28B CC allele . The regimen differ treatment participant achieve undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) end peginterferon alfa-2a ( peg-IFN ) plus ribavirin ( RBV ) 4 week lead-in . Participants receive either peg-IFN + RBV ( Arm 1 ) BOC + peg-IFN + RBV ( Arm 2 ) . The hypothesis Arm 2 noninferior Arm 1 proportion participant undetectable HCV RNA Follow-Up ( FU ) Week 24 .</brief_summary>
