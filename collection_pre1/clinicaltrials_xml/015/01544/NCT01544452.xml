	<brief_summary>Patients rectal cancer undergo MRI rectum , CT thorax abdomen ( thorax x-ray ultrasonic liver evaluation ) colonoscopy total diagnostic evaluation surgery . MR colonography show high sensitivity specificity large polyps cancer MRI liver show similar high sensitivity CT liver metastasis . Since patient already undergo MR rectum , investigator propose total diagnostic evaluation MRI liver , abdomen , colonography rectum one session ( minus thorax evaluation ) instead two three different method evaluation . The investigator hypothesis total MR evaluation equal superior exist preoperative evaluation regard diagnosis synchronous cancer liver metastasis regard cost-benefit total diagnostic evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Preoperative MR Diagnostic Evaluation Versus Standard Diagnostic Evaluation Patients With Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) among common cancer form Denmark approximate 4300 new case Denmark annually , rectal cancer represent approximately 1400 new case year . It also well know synchronous cancer polyp present 11 % 58 % respectively patient CRC . It assume adenomas constitute precursor cancer thus speculate detection removal adenoma could reduce incidence mortality colorectal cancer . Danish Colorectal Cancer Group ( DCCG ) Danish Surgical Society ( DKS ) currently recommend full colonic investigation part preoperative assessment , also include MRI rectum , ultrasound liver chest X-ray ( abdominal /chest CT ) locate possible metastasis synchronous tumor . However , often difficult implement preoperative colonic investigation due lack capacity tumor stenosis . A recent Danish study show 78 % patient colorectal cancer receive full colonic investigation preoperatively . In instance recommendation DCCG &amp; DKS patient absence complete colonic investigation preoperatively , undergo colonoscopy within 3 month postoperatively . Within last 15 year new non-invasive imaging technique develop , include MR colonography ( MRC ) . Like conventional colonoscopy , MRC require bowel cleansing , since feces create artifact hide mimic polyp abnormality . After cleanse colon distend water use rectal catheter . Since water need pas possibly stenotic colon segment , good chance successfully examine entire colon compare colonoscopy . A recent study show 98 % success rate use MRC examine entire colon patient CRC colon stenosis . The MRC preform colon fully distend water depend resolution need scan time 10 15 minute . Data processing , reconstruction analysis make independent workstation . The advantage MRC non-invasive nature , short examination time , fact sedation unnecessary . This make possible patient discharge directly imaging procedure oppose necessity admission colonoscopy effect sedative drug wear . Furthermore , assume patient compliance much high MRC , since almost every patient find less unpleasant colonoscopy . MRI liver well-known procedure show good result diagnosis hepatic metastasis primary cancer . Several study show equal well CT ultrasound liver . Currently study , make overall preoperative assessment mean one investigating technique , namely MRI . The investigator previously study sensitivity/specificity patient satisfaction MRI colonography fecal tagging . In study investigator want investigate quality MR-colonography bowel cleansing , also assess economical aspect overall examination rectum , colon liver patient rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
