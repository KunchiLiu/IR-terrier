	<brief_summary>Abdominoplasty one commonly perform procedure plastic surgery . The appearance scar major factor contribute aesthetic outcome procedure depend largely technique wound closure . The investigator routinely use resorbable subcutaneous suture resorbable intracutaneous suture closure . To overcome potential detrimental effect suture skin closure , surgical adhesive introduce new technology . The new PrineoTM wound closure system create combine effectiveness 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate ( Dermabond TM ) together self-adhering mesh make closure long skin incision even safe reliable . PrineoTM potential offer patient several benefit traditional wound closure sutures.A patient treat Prineoâ„¢ shower immediately follow procedure product form watertight barrier incision . PrineoTM easily remove , often less pain sometimes associated suture removal , natural wound heal process complete ( approximately 12 25 day ) . Other benefit form microbial barrier provide even distribution tension across length incision ensure wound edge approximation throughout wound heal process . Furthermore , reduces subcuticular closure time compare subcuticular suturing . However , potential advantage proven , method use assess aesthetic outcome reproducible assessment , none study assess patient satisfaction.1-3 Moreover , none perform plastic surgical patient population . For reason , investigator prospectively study result wound closure abdominoplasty randomize use PrineoTM conventional suture ass possible difference outcome two method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominoplasty one commonly perform procedure plastic surgery . The appearance scar major factor contribute aesthetic outcome procedure depend largely technique wound closure . The new PrineoTM wound closure system introduce combine effectiveness 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate ( Dermabond TM ) together self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two woman 8 men age 21 65 year schedule abdominoplasty include study . Two week postoperatively , wound examine graded accord Hollander Cosmesis Scale . At 3- 6-month follow-up , aesthetic outcome abdominal scar evaluate Vancouver Scar Scale . Six month postoperatively , patient ask score part Patient Scar Assessment Scale.The Hollander Cosmesis Scale indicate significantly favourable overall result PrineoTM 2 week surgery . The Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrate well cosmetic outcome favour PrineoTM 3 6 month surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale score 6 month surgery indicate patient note significantly less pain , thickness irregularity PrineoTM.Based investigator result , investigator conclude PrineoTM safe effective substitute superficial skin closure , good cosmetic result increase wound complication . The use PrineoTM decrease operative time enhance patient ' postoperative comfort</detailed_description>
