	<detailed_description>What do protocol ? Specific Aim 1 : To investigate correlation change RBF exposure iodinate contrast agent , measure CEU , occurrence acute kidney injury ( AKI ) population subject risk CN . Procedures : Subjects estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , measure Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula , 30 - 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 schedule coronary angiogram enrol study . These subject consider high risk CN . It important clarify subject schedule coronary angiography clinical reason enrollment study . Coronary angiography part intervention protocol . The decision regard need coronary angiography strategy prevention make subject ' healthcare provider research team . The detail protocol discuss interventional cardiologist permission obtain discus study detail potential subject . Eligible subject identify search electronic medical record individual list cardiac catheterization laboratory schedule inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects appear qualify study participation base medical record review inclusion exclusion criterion approach . The detail study goal , procedure risk discuss individual question answer . The subject ask sign inform consent form . They enrol study . Since undergo X-ray examination exposure iodinate contrast medium contraindicate pregnancy , assume woman child bear age test rule pregnancy enrol study . If test do , contact subject 's cardiologist arrange part clinical care research related procedure . At time enrollment data subject ' age , race , gender , ethnicity , history coronary artery disease , diabetes congestive heart failure collect . Subjects history heart failure ask presence symptom heart failure shortness breath rest activity , fatigue , palpitation dyspnea . This information use identify New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class heart failure consider risk factor CN . List medication use subject also record . Vital sign record . Blood sample basic metabolic panel urine sample urinalysis collect sent University Virginia lab . More blood urine sample collect measurement concentration biomarkers kidney injury neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , cystatin C , beta 2 microglobulin , epithelial growth factor ( EGF ) , uromodulin , osteopontin , albumin creatinine . These sample send O'Brien Center University San Diego , California analysis.. Baseline 2-dimensional kidney ultrasound image obtain . All study subject undergo baseline contrast enhance ultrasound image kidney use Definity intravenous infusion describe detail . They receive intravenous infusion normal saline prevention CN . Please see `` hydration protocol '' . Immediately transfer cardiac catheterization lab volume expansion i.v . normal saline , CEU image kidney use Definity repeat . Subjects undergo coronary angiogram procedure plan interventional cardiologist . Immediately procedure , CEU image kidney use Definity repeat . Subjects monitor minimum 30 minute completion Definity infusion . Blood sample basic metabolic panel urine sample urinalysis collect sent UVA lab . The research study procedures visit end time . Routine cardiac catheterization lab procedure follow time . Information volume type ICM record . Subjects discharge schedule cardiology team . One three day ( 24 - 72 hour ) later subject return follow visit . During follow visit , question ask assess potential adverse event . Vital sign obtain ( blood pressure heart rate ) . Blood sample basic metabolic panel urine sample urinalysis collect sent UVA lab . More blood urine sample collect measurement concentration biomarkers kidney injury NGAL , cystatin C , beta 2 microglobulin , EGF , uromodulin , osteopontin , albumin creatinine . These sample send O'Brien Center University San Diego California . The outcome study , AKI , define rise great 0.3 mg/dL 25 % baseline serum creatinine concentration 48 hour exposure ICM . Specific Aim 2 : To validate RBF data obtain CEU compare measurement obtain Doppler ultrasound probe place inside main renal artery . Procedures : Up 25 subject normal renal function schedule coronary angiography study part propose study . Blood sample basic metabolic panel urine sample urinalysis collect sent UVA lab . Immediately undergoing coronary angiography , subject undergo CEU study use Definity measure baseline RBF . Femoral radial access already obtain perform coronary angiogram . A guide catheter use selectively engage renal artery 5 cc contrast inject perform renal angiography . If renal artery appear angiographically normal without evidence degree atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis , Doppler flow wire ( 0.014 '' ) advance main renal artery . If patient already systemically anticoagulated coronary angiogram coronary intervention , heparin administer ( 50 U/kg ) prevent clot Doppler wire . Proper position Doppler wire confirm inject 1-2 cc contrast . Velocity blood flow within main renal artery measure directly use Doppler wire . After completion measurement , coronary angiography procedure perform schedule . Measurement blood velocity main renal artery Doppler probe repeat removal arterial catheter . CEU use Definity measurement RBF repeat point . Subjects monitor minimum 30 minute completion Definity infusion urine sample obtain send UVA lab urinalysis . Blood sample basic metabolic panel collect sent UVA lab . The change baseline velocity blood exposure ICM obtain Doppler probe compare value obtain CEU . Multiple measurement ( least three ) use method perform time point mean measurement compare . Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Subjects connect continuous pulse oximeter heart monitor . The Definity vial place room temperature use . It activate shake vial use Vialmix 45 second . It use immediately activation . 1.3 mL Definity mix 30 ml preservative free saline . Infusion Definity peripheral vein start 2 ml/min titrate optimal image quality ( exceed 10 ml/min time ) . After reach steady state ( 2 -3 minute ) baseline contrast ultrasound image right kidney perform low mechanical index ( MI ) 0.1 . High MI ( 1.0 ) impulse use disrupt Definity microbubbles within kidney tissue . This would result brief time period renal cortex free microbubbles appear completely anechoic ( time zero ) . As continuous infusion microbubbles continue , wash-in period renal tissue replenish microbubbles . Time-intensity curve disruption tissue microbubbles fit rise exponential function : intensity ( ) = basic intensity ( BI ) + A [ 1-exp ( -beta.t ) use specialize software . The slope curve beta relate velocity microbubbles ( blood ) enter tissue plateau curve A related relative blood volume within tissue . Since blood flow movement certain volume blood certain speed , product two ( A.beta ) would represent tissue blood flow . After disruption microbubbles within kidney tissue high MI pulse , continuous image kidney low MI ( 0.1 ) continue 15- 30 second generate time-intensity graph . The high MI pulse replenishment sequence repeat two time . An average three parameter obtain time period use final analysis . Infusion Definity stop point . A urine sample collect urinalysis 30 minute stop Definity assess potential renal related adverse event . Hydration Protocol : 0.9 % sodium chloride ( normal saline ) solution infuse intravenously rate 3 mL/kg/hr one hour . This follow normal saline give rate 1 ml/kg/hr remainder time also least one hour coronary angiogram . Patients heart failure document ejection fraction &lt; 30 % receive normal saline infusion reduce rate 1.5 ml/kg/hr 1st hour follow 0.5 mL/kg/hr time period subject . At point , subject experience shortness breath , oxygen saturation measure intravenous hydration protocol stop .</detailed_description>
