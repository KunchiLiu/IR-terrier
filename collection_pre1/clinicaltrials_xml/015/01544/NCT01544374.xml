	<detailed_description>Breast cancer second common cause cancer death woman . Black woman less likely white woman develop breast cancer , likely die disease . Some survival discrepancy likely due underuse adjuvant therapy proven increase survival . Breast cancer treatment often require coordination among surgeon , pathologist , primary care physician , medical radiation oncologist . In NYC , black Hispanic woman access care underwent surgical treatment breast cancer twice likely white experience underuse proven-effective adjuvant treatment . Disturbingly , 1/3 underuse case episodes surgeon recommend treatment , patient refuse yet , care ensue . Underuse circumstance attribute system failure rather provider patient factor . Such system failure occur often among minority woman among woman treat hospital serve predominantly minority patient . To target system failures 6 NYC hospital , 4 serve predominantly minority patient , use quasi-experimental pre-post test design implement track feedback registry . The Tracking Feedback registry close referral loop surgeon oncologist , increase rate complete oncology consultation , increase treatment rate eliminate racial disparity underuse . Its effect great 4 hospital serve predominantly minority woman , site EMR patient navigation prior T &amp; F implementation . However , trial randomize , track feedback function perform study personnel embed hospital 's workflow detail surgeon response feedback assess , result call work area . In proposed randomized control trial , implement Tracking Feedback ( T &amp; F ) innovation hospital serve predominantly minority woman . We test effectiveness Tracking Feedback registry innovation increase rate complete oncology consultation , reduce underuse need adjuvant therapy racial disparity receipt treatment . We also assess feasibility implement T &amp; F Registry high-risk hospital evaluate implementation effectiveness innovation . We recruit 10 hospital serve large proportion minority woman breast cancer . We randomize hospital recruit 354 woman new breast cancer , 177 per intervention arm . We choose `` high risk '' hospital serve predominantly minority population , hospital higher rate system failure cause underuse , specifically , type underuse target Tracking Feedback Registry . We : adapt exist laptop-based Tracking &amp; Feedback software create protect web-based format easily accessible participate hospital ; tailor Tracking &amp; Feedback registry participate hospital ' appropriate workflow include area pathology , surgery , medical radiation oncology tumor registry personnel process ; embed track feedback task within exist hospital structure personnel increase likelihood sustainability beyond grant . We include web-based T &amp; F Registry electronic data capture system assess response action track information feed back surgeon . To assess T &amp; F Registry 's effectiveness , compare rate underuse patient treat intervention versus control hospital . To assess implementation effectiveness hospital , assess process outcome use qualitative quantitative method . Qualitatively , conduct pre- &amp; post-intervention interview key stakeholder assess implementation climate stakeholder ' view Registry 's utility . Quantitatively , measure track action take response feedback information . As variability across hospital , also assess hospital 's treatment rate pre- ( N=540 ) post-intervention ( N=354 ) provide additional quantitative measure implementation effectiveness .</detailed_description>
