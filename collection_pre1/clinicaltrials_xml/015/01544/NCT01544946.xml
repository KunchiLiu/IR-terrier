	<brief_summary>Background : Early recognition treatment pain among child important cognitive development future response pain throughout life . Oral sweet solution accept effective pain reduce agent procedure neonatal population . To date , limited number publish clinical trial emergency set study type intervention among infant undergo venous puncture bladder catheterization . These study report conflict result . No previous study evaluate utilization sucrose manage pain nasopharyngeal aspiration . Objective : To compare efficacy oral sucrose solution versus placebo reduce pain child one three month age nasopharyngeal aspiration Emergency Department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION Acute pain one common adverse stimulus experience child , occur result injury , illness , necessary medical procedures1 . The American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) American Pain Society ( APS ) jointly issue statement promote responsibility paediatrician leader advocate ensure humane competent treatment pain suffer infant , child , adolescent . Long-term effect unmanaged pain human infant show include permanent impairment element cognitive development , learning , memory , behavior , increase somatisation childhood . The plasticity develop brain change occur response painful stimulus also contribute altered perception pain late life . Early painful experience affect child 's future responses analgesia . Weisman et al find inadequate analgesia young child procedure diminish effect adequate analgesia subsequent procedure . Many study suggest prompt accurate recognition treatment pain young infant important immediate comfort best possible lifelong development . Despite recent interest paediatric pain assessment , prevention treatment , many child receive adequate management alleviate pain . The ideal pre-procedural analgesic agent minor invasive procedure would cost-effective , inexpensive , short-acting agent associate risk . The use sucrose well study certain procedure patient neonatal intensive care unit newborn nursery setting , particularly venous blood draw , capillary blood test circumcision . In study , infant receive oral sucrose solution procedure cry less overall decreased behavioral pain response compare receive placebo . Furthermore , sucrose show safe intervention serious life-threatening adverse event report side effect consist minimal cough administration . Sucrose inexpensive , short acting , non-sedating , easily administer non-invasive . Administration sucrose require additional training expose infant risk great associate breast bottle feeding . Nasopharyngeal aspiration ( NPA ) common procedure Emergency Department ( ED ) , especially wintertime . It also recognize way support small child bronchiolitis upper respiratory viral illness . There currently paucity literature perception pain discomfort nasopharyngeal aspiration . Macfarlane al . compare nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate RSV test child 1 month 20 month . Infant distress measure use facial , cry , movement score scale ( FLACC ) . A median score six obtain group nasopharyngeal aspirate comparison median score cinq nasal swab ( p &lt; 0,0001 ) . Sucrose administer non-nutritive sucking two minute prior procedure recognize safe16 efficient way relieve pain minor procedure neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . It contribute decrease physiologic response painful stimulus ( heart rate , respiratory rate decrease oxygensaturation ) well attenuate pain behavior decrease overall score pain scale . Since 1998 , Cochrane Database Review recommend use sucrose procedural pain neonatal population . The late edition ( 2010 ) provide sufficient evidence recommend use sucrose single heel lance puncture consideration venipuncture . Authors conclude study need extend use sucrose neonatal common painful procedure bladder catheterization , nasogastric tube insertion suction . Studies use sucrose relieve pain routine immunization suggest analgesic property effect beyond infancy , despite upper age limit appropriate concentration quantity sucrose unknown age group . Randomized controlled trial EDs introduce use sucrose venipuncture bladder catheterization old infant . Curtis al demonstrate trend toward reduce pain child zero six month age use sucrose venipuncture . However benefit seem limited infant less three month old significant variation pain scale score beyond age ( three six month ) . In second study , Rogers al . show use sucrose infant undergoes bladder catheterization reduce variation pain scale score enhance quick return baseline infant 1 30 day life , infant group 30 90 day fail demonstrate relation . No specific study find pain management nasopharyngeal aspiration infant ED . Also , study use variety concentration sucrose range 24 % 75 % . Systematic review current literature unable demonstrate superiority one concentration sweet solution another21-25 , many study suggest high concentration sweet solution seem effective . Therefore , investigator choose study effect sweet solution name syrup B.P . ( product Laboratoire Atlas inc. ) contain 88 % sucrose . This solution already commonly use population infant three month age safe ( e.g . prednisone syrup codeine syrup make use syrup ) . A two milliliter dose 88 % sucrose contains amount carbohydrate 25 milliliter infant milk formula contain approximately 7,5g/100 milliliter 30 . Also , 88 % sucrose sugar concentration many medication commonly use infant , oral antibiotic , oral steroid solution pain medication ( e.g . codeine syrup ) . This syrup particular interest low cost ( $ 9,58 bottle 2000 milliliter ) , universally available , stable viable approximately three month . Therefore , procedure study would easy apply clinical setting . Finally , painful procedure choose study nasopharyngeal aspiration . This procedure frequently perform ED age group , particularly winter either therapeutic diagnostic procedure . To date , pain scale validate precisely age group study project . However , Face , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) scale recommend IMMPACT group ( Initiative Methods , Measurement Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ) . FLACC easily applicable pain scale observer score patient five category , zero two point , total score maximum 10 point . The validity reliability pain scale establish past child 2 month 7 year . Validity evaluate compare FLACC scale Objective Pain Scale demonstrate tool show similar behaviour ( r=0.80 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . The interrater reliability two observer consider good ( r [ 87 ] =0.94 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) kappa value great 0,50 category . Therefore , pain scale chosen measure investigator primary outcome , population infant one three month old . Furthermore , Neonatal Infant Pain Scale ( NIPS ) well validate pain scale newborns one month age . This pain scale choose secondary outcome . The investigator hypothesize use one pain scale validate infant 1 month age another validate infant old two month age allow u assess pain infant one three month age best , give current available tool . Furthermore , several patient parameter use corroborate finding . HYPOTHESIS The investigator believe provide oral sucrose solution nasopharyngeal aspiration decrease pain level infants one three month age . OBJECTIVES The investigator primary objective compare efficacy oral 88 % sucrose solution placebo solution reduce pain assess FLACC scale child one three month nasopharyngeal aspiration ED . The investigator secondary objective ass change pain level per NIPS score . The investigator also measure variation heart rate cry time . Any side effect also report .</detailed_description>
