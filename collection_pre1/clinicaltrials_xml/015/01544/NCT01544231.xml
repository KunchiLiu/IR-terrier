	<brief_summary>This research project consist prospective diagnostic study conduct patient clinical suspicion rhabdomyolysis admit emergency room University Hospitals Nimes , Montpellier , Paris , Nice Toulon Inter Army Hospital . The main objective study determine whether plasma level Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) may retain predictor acute renal failure ( ARF ) occur within 48 hour admission rhabdomyolysis .</brief_summary>
