	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure rest energy expenditure , total energy expenditure , physical activity recover burn child well understand relation impaired growth nutritional status ; measure whole body muscle protein turnover recovery burn injury understand impact body composition energy metabolism . It also aim look change lean body mass , fat mass , bone mineral density bone mineral content rehabilitation early convalescence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Measures total rest energy expenditure , protein turnover , body composition nutritional outcome-based measure make patient receive inpatient rehabilitative care burn injury . Patients consist acutely burn patient initially admit hospital burn 40 % total body , recently recover acute phase injury achieve wound closure define less 5 % open wound area ( Group A ) . In addition , patient admit hospital `` acute rehabilitation '' , include patient need rehabilitative therapy also include . This latter group ( Group B ) unique patient may open wound area remain due difficulty healing , however critically ill. Group B may differ typical rehabilitation population see hospital open wound receive care initial injury elsewhere . They include due apparent nutritional compromise unique energy protein requirement difficult predict accord clinical experience . These patient likely require artificial nutrition support benefit information gain study . Measurements make baseline defined time wound closure ( time admission Group B ) . Subsequent measure do follow : 1 ) total energy expenditure assessed week 1-3 week 7-9 . During week 1 7 , protein turnover study take place . Indirect calorimetry physical activity measure take place 2 consecutive day week . Lean body mass measurement do time wound closure discharge . The study end time discharge . Resting total energy expenditure do use indirect calorimetry rest energy expenditure doubly label water method total energy expenditure . Briefly , methodology doubly label water follow . Two pre-dose urine specimen collect prior oral dose contain 0.22 g/kg total body water 100 % 18O water ( 1.2 g/kg per body weight 10 % 18O water ) 0.11 g/kg per body weight 99.9 % deuterium oxide . Three post-dose urine void collect , follow collection morning urine void daily 7 day . Total energy expenditure method represent average energy expenditure 21-day period . It obtain week 1-3 week 7-9 week rehabilitative phase . Resting energy expenditure determine use indirect calorimetry metabolic cart 2 consecutive day week . Physical activity determine patient wear physical activity monitor ( Actical Physical Monitoring System , mini-Mitter , Co. , Inc , Bend Oregon ) wrist , ankle hand entire day twice week ( correspond metabolic cart measurement ) . This worn 2 day week . Protein nutritional status turnover measure use N15 glycine . Three methyl-histidine measure time N15 glycine study ( week 1 7 ) ass contribution muscle mass protein turnover . On day tracer study , patient provide urine sample , urine sample collect determine basal level N15 enrichment urea ammonia . Then patient receive single dose ( 4mg/kg , less 2 % normal daily intake 1.1g per person ) 15N glycine tracer . For , patient drink dose 15N glycine ( 4mg.kg 1dissolved 20 ml saline ) mix 50 cc apple juice liquid beverage , follow 50 cc wash water . 24 hour urine collection commence immediately . Twenty-four hour urine use determine 15N NH3 15N urea enrichment . Each urine container contain 5 ml 15N HCl trap urinary ammonium . Urine collect day 3 day , determination total urinary nitrogen , urea creatinine , ammonia excretion . Lean body mass , fat mass bone mineral density content determine baseline ( time wound closure- routine care ) discharge . Body composition component ( lean body mass , fat mass bone mineral density ) determine lumbar spine whole body use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) Discovery QDR 4500 A ( Hologic , Waltham , MA ) burn healthy child . Scanning perform study staff train certify use DXA . DXA use x-ray beam two photon energy estimate body composition . Prior scan , height measure time measurement session subject stand barefoot light clothe use stadiometer . Measures record near 0.5 centimeter respectively . Weight take use balance scale record near 0.5 kilogram . DXA measurements do patient lie flat back DXA scan table . Subjects position scanner spine straight table pad . For lumbar spine measurement , knee positioner place patient 's low leg patient 's knee hip 90 degree angle . To align C-arm ( scan arm ) DXA , laser line position 1-2 inch patient 's ileac crest , center around patient 's midline . The scan time approximate 10 second , exposure 0.38 mRem . For whole body scan , subject lay back body straight , arm side , palm , separate thigh . The scanner rotate subject 's legs inward 25 degree toe touch , use tape around foot maintain position . The subject instruct breathe normally . The total scan time approximate 2.5 3.5 minute exposure 0.26 mRem . Total body fat lean body mass determine DEXA describe part whole body bone mineral density scan ( 1 scan session require ) . Measures % body fat content % lean body mass content whole body obtain use DEXA software . These value compare age sex match pediatric reference data body composition { { 217 Ellis , K.J . 2000 ; } } . Because measure LBM confound hydration status , second measure LBM use bioelectrical impedance make point compare .</detailed_description>
