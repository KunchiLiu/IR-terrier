	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing DEB Versus Conventional PTA Treatment Hemodialysis AVF AVG Stenoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Neointimal hyperplasia main cause hemodialysis access [ arterio-venous fistula ( AVF ) graft ( AVG ) ] dysfunction thrombosis . Although endovascular technique like percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) , catheter direct thrombolysis , mechanical thrombectomy bare metal stenting , may salvage access , long term patency remain dismal due recurrent stenosis neointimal hyperplasia . Drug Eluting Balloon ( DEB ) effective inhibit neointimal hyperplasia treatment coronary in-stent restenosis since 2006 recently femoropopliteal artery , reduce restenosis rate prolong patency . Specific Aim : To determine efficacy DEB reduce restenosis rate prolong patency AVFs/AVGs compare PTA . Hypothesis : DEB superior PTA reduce late luminal loss restenosis rate , prolong primary secondary patency . Methodology : Prospective , randomized clinical trial study population comprise patient dysfunctional AVFs/AVGs due underlying stenosis . The patient randomize receive either DEB PTA . The 6-month late luminal loss primary endpoint . The secondary endpoint restenosis rate , primary secondary patency , also determine . Major Clinical Significance : Hemodialysis access failure constitute significant morbidity cost patient healthcare system . Maintaining access patency consume significant resource constitute significant portion work vascular surgeon , nephrologists interventional radiologist . Any strategy reduce access failure prolong access lifespan beneficial . If DEB proven superior PTA , paradigm shift management hemodialysis access failure restenosis - similar DEB change practice manage coronary artery in-stent restenosis .</detailed_description>
