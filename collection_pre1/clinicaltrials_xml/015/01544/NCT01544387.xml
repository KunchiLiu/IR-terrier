	<brief_title>Preterm Premature Rupture Membranes ( PPROM ) : Bed Rest Versus Activity Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bed rest home hospital widely advise many complication pregnancy , include preterm premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) - problem water break prematurely accompany labor . For patient , bed rest represent significant change lifestyle , include stop work , and/or able household duty take care child . In pregnancy , complicate PPROM , patient usually hospitalize place bed rest throughout stay . Despite widespread use , good publish study evaluate effect bed rest common complication pregnancy . There , hand , several study indicate bed rest may actually harmful . Bed rest show increase patient 's risk develop blood clot legs lung . Bed rest may also myriad deleterious effect muscle bone atrophy . Furthermore , bed rest show emotionally distress patient family . Once amniotic membrane break , amniotic fluid generally continue leak remainder pregnancy , fetus otherwise good health continue make amniotic fluid urination . In patient hospitalize PPROM , objective assessment obtain ultrasound amniotic fluid index ( AFI ) , measure much amniotic fluid remain despite water broken . It think great amount amniotic fluid may indicative long duration/continuation pregnancy few adverse interim effect cord compression . Remaining bed rest think perhaps affect AFI positive way . It unclear whether retain ability ambulate would affect AFI , amniotic fluid continue leak even bed rest ; benefit ambulation may well worthwhile . Twice weekly ultrasound amniotic fluid measurement check assess effect ambulation verse bed rest pregnancy complicate PPROM , secondarily look overall outcome pregnancy . The objective study determine , randomize clinical trial , whether bed rest helpful management pregnancy complicate preterm premature rupture membrane .</detailed_description>
