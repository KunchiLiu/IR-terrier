	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION Acute pain one common adverse stimulus experience child , occur result injury , illness , necessary medical procedure . The American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) American Pain Society ( APS ) jointly issue statement promote responsibility paediatrician leader advocate ensure humane competent treatment pain suffer infant , child , adolescent . Long-term effect unmanaged pain human infant show include permanent impairment element cognitive development , learning , memory , behaviour , increase somatisation childhood . The plasticity develop brain change occur response painful stimulus also contribute altered perception pain late life . Early painful experience affect child 's future responses analgesia . Weisman et al find inadequate analgesia young child procedure diminish effect adequate analgesia subsequent procedure . Many study suggest prompt accurate recognition treatment pain young infant important immediate comfort best possible lifelong development . Despite recent interest paediatric pain assessment , prevention treatment , many child receive adequate management alleviate pain . The ideal pre-procedural analgesic agent minor invasive procedure would cost-effective , inexpensive , short-acting agent associate risk . The use sucrose well study certain procedure neonatal intensive care unit patient newborn nursery setting , particularly venous blood draw , capillary blood test circumcision . In study , infant receive oral sucrose solution procedure cry less overall decreased behavioural pain response compare receive placebo . Furthermore , sucrose show safe intervention serious life-threatening adverse event report side effect consist minimal cough administration . A Cochrane systematic review conclude sucrose safe effective reduce procedural pain single short procedural event neonate , optimal dose could identify due inconsistency effective sucrose dosage among study . A review publish study report sucrose glucose healthy term preterm infant single episode heel lance , venipuncture intramuscular injection effective . However , uncertainty remain beyond neonatal period , give limited number publish study . In Emergency Departments ( ED ) , child undergo many painful procedure , bladder catheterization , capillary blood test , venipuncture lumbar puncture . Only two study examine effectiveness sweet solution analgesic ED . A randomize control trial emergency set sucrose and/or pacifier infant receive venipuncture conduct Curtis al among infant 0 6 month demonstrate trend reduce pain among sub-group infant 0 3 month . However , study show difference pain scale 3 month age . Also , study examine effect sucrose bladder catheterization , subgroup infant 1 30 day old received sweet solution show small change pain score , less likely cry catheterization return baseline quickly , comparison placebo group . However , among child 31 90 day , statistically significant difference pain score . In study , use sucrose solution 24 % say discussion , possible old infant , average receive small dose ( milligrams per kilogram ) , fact underdosed . Moreover , use Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau-né ( DAN ) pain scale , less recognize FLACC scale evaluate pain study population . Finally , enough participant 30 90 day age obtain statistical significance age group . Also , study use variety concentration sucrose ( e.g . Rogers use sucrose 24 % , Curtis use sucrose 44 % Lewindon use sucrose 75 % ) . Systematic review current literature unable demonstrate superiority one concentration sweet solution another , many study suggest high concentration sweet solution seem effective . Therefore , investigator choose study effect sweet solution name syrup B.P . ( product Laboratoire Atlas inc. ) contain 88 % sucrose . This solution already commonly use population infant 3 month age safe ( e.g . prednisone syrup make use syrup ) . A 2 ml dose 88 % sucrose contains amount carbohydrate 25 ml infant milk formula contain approximately 7,5g/100 ml . Also , 88 % sucrose concentration sugar many medication commonly use infant , oral antibiotic , oral steroid solution pain medication . This syrup particular interest low cost ( $ 9,58 bottle 2000 ml ) , universally available , stable viable approximately three month . Therefore , intervention study would easy apply clinical setting . Finally , painful procedure choose study bladder catheterization . Bladder catheterization frequently perform ED age group . To date , pain scale validate precisely age group study project . However , Face , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) scale recommend IMMPACT group ( Initiative Methods , Measurement Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ) . FLACC easily applicable pain scale observer score patient 5 category , 0 2 point , total score maximum 10 point . The validity reliability pain scale establish past child 2 month 7 year . Validity evaluate compare FLACC scale Objective Pain Scale demonstrate tool show similar behaviour ( r=0.80 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . The interrater reliability 2 observer consider good ( r [ 87 ] =0.94 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) kappa value great 0,50 category . Therefore , pain scale chosen measure investigator primary outcome , population infant 1 3 month old . Furthermore , Neonatal Infant Pain Scale ( NIPS ) well validate pain scale newborn 1 month age . This pain scale choose secondary outcome . The investigator estimate use one pain scale validate infant 1 month age another validate infant old 2 month age allow u assess pain infant 1 3 month age best , give current available tool . Furthermore , patient parameter heart rate cry time use corroborate finding . HYPOTHESIS THe investigator believe provide oral sucrose solution bladder catheterization decrease pain level infants 1 3 month age . OBJECTIVES The investigator primary objective compare efficacy oral 88 % sucrose solution placebo solution reduce pain assess FLACC scale child 1 3 month bladder catheterization ED . The investigator secondary objective ass change pain level per NIPS score . The investigator also measure variation heart rate cry time . All side effect also report .</detailed_description>
