	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether treatment ranolazine low dose dronedarone reduce atrial fibrillation burden ( AFB ) subject paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) , whether combination therapy ( ranolazine low dose dronedarone ) superior individual drug therapy reduce AFB . This phase 2 clinical trial conduct 16 week involve Screening period ( 4 week ) Treatment period ( 12 week ) . The final follow visit occur 2 week end Treatment period . Primary Secondary endpoint evaluate accord treatment group , clinic visit period , overall Treatment period . Safety analysis conduct clinic visit , include : cardiac rhythm monitoring , ECG testing , laboratory evaluation , symptom adverse event assessment .</brief_summary>
