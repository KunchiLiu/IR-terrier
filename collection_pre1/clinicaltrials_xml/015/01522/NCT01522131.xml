	<brief_summary>Purpose : The propose study evaluate compare clinical response use bioresorbable collagen membrane alone defect debridement erbium Laser irradiation conjunction bioresorbable collagen membrane treatment Class II furcation defect maxillary mandibular teeth . The study examine whether superior regeneration potential laser energy combine membrane defect isolation . Procedure : The study use 2 group , control group test group 16 patient group , severe chronic periodontitis clinical radiographic evidence Class II furcation defect buccal lingual mandibular molar Class II furcation defect buccal maxillary molar . 16 patient serve control group open flap debridement bioresorbable collagen membrane mode treatment . Group 2 : 16 patient serve test group undergo open flap debridement conjunction Er , Cr : YSGG laser irradiation bioresorbable collagen membrane use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Laser Use Guided Tissue Regeneration Treatment Molar Teeth With Class 2 Furcation Affected Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject patient record Graduate Periodontics clinic UT School Dentistry . These individual already diagnose chronic periodontitis require surgical intervention treat disease process . All patient receive initial periodontal therapy consist oral hygiene instruction scale root planing . Once enrolled study , subject receive surgical therapy involve open flap debridement affect furcation defect along membrane isolation defect . The test group debridement perform Er , Cr : YSGG laser ultrasonic cleansing , control group hand instrumentation along ultrasonic cleansing . This procedure take approximately 1.5 hour . Postoperative appointment 1,2,4,8 week require 15-30 minute per appointment ; 3 month periodontal maintenance reinforcement home care require 45 minute ; 6 month periodontal maintenance , reassessment furcation defect correction residual defect require 75 minute . Patients exit study 2 week last maintenance appointment place recall Department Periodontics dental hygienist . The total time commitment patient 6 month .</detailed_description>
