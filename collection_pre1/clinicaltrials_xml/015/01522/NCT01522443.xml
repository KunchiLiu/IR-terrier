	<brief_summary>Bone metastasis associate pain major cause morbidity mortality castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Most approved therapy show ability reduce soft tissue lesion none meaningfully impact bone metastasis ( demonstrate lack resolution lesion bone scan agent ) pain associated metastasis . This study evaluate effect cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone pain response bone scan response men CRPC .</brief_summary>
