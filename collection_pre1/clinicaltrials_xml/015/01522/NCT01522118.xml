	<brief_summary>Since prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) introduce clinical screening tool prostate cancer , men diagnose small focus cancer instead advance disease . The present choice treatment men localize prostate cancer lie active surveillance radical therapy . Thus , option treat cancer within prostate gland spar non-cancerous tissue quite appeal , yet controversial . At present consistent scientific data focal therapy major effectiveness . Focal therapy prostate cancer define therapy selectively ablate known disease preserve exist function , overall aim minimize lifetime morbidity without compromise life expectancy . The aim investigator study test Magnetic Resonance guide Focused Ultrasound ablation determine non-invasive necrosis focal , locally non-advanced prostate cancer . The study design Phase 1 , treatment &amp; resection protocol . With project investigator aim evaluate safety identify side effect Magnetic Resonance guide Focused Ultrasound treat focal prostate cancer . This design also expand knowledge effect Magnetic Resonance guide Focused Ultrasound onto peri-prostatic environment determine surgery safely adopt non-invasive treatment .</brief_summary>
