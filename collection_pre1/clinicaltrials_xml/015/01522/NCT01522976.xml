	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well azacitidine work without lenalidomide vorinostat treat patient higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer cell stop blood flow cancer . Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether azacitidine effective without lenalidomide vorinostat treat myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine With Without Lenalidomide Vorinostat Treating Patients With Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To select base response rate ( complete remission , partial remission , hematologic improvement ) either combination lenalidomide azacitidine combination vorinostat azacitidine test single-agent azacitidine among patient higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) . ( Phase II ) II . To compare overall survival combination arm select Phase II portion trial single-agent azacitidine among patient higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate relapse-free survival , overall survival cytogenetic response rate patient treat regimen . II . To estimate frequency severity toxicity three regimen patient population . III . To investigate preliminary manner frequency subgroups pre-study cytogenetic study correlate subgroup clinical outcome patient population . IV . To collect specimen bank use future research study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . In Phase III , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( combination arm select Phase II single-agent azacitidine arm ) . ARM I : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-7 day 1-5 8-9 , lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive azacitidine Arm I . ARM III : Patients receive azacitidine Arm I vorinostat PO twice daily ( BID ) day 3-9 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
