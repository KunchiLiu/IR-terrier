	<brief_title>Detection Rate Liver Metastases With Contrast Enhanced Intraoperative Ultrasound Compared Regular Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : The surgical resection colorectal liver metastases curative therapy patient ( 1 ) . Because major part patient become diagnosed technical irresectable stadium , patient primary get chemotherapy reach secondary resection ( 2 ) . Especially group patient effective preoperative stag necessary know exact number location liver metastasis . Standard image abdominal CT contrast medium , lately also possible create 3D analysis base vasculatory territory 2D data ( 3 ) ( 4 ) . Alternatively MRI image use well , defiency image vascular anatomy partly suit surgical planning resection . By contrast enhance sonography develop use dignity evaluation leasions . Depending examiner provide useful information ( 5 ) . Because intraoperative ultrasound sensitive specific diagnosic procedure ( 6 ) , intraoperative use contrast medium ultrasound seem suggest . As necessary ultrasonic probe n't avaiable , experience make yet ( 7 ) . Aim study compare value describe method consider detection rate colorectal metastasis , include available intraoperative cm-ultrasound . From comparison modern method ( 64-line doublehelix CT , 3D virtual operation planning , 3 tesla Primovist-MRI , pre- intraoperative contrast enhance sonography ) aim get reliable recommendation preoperative necessary staging . 1 . Background : state research/ scientific arguementation/ lead question In last 20 year , surgery colorectal liver metastases develop lot ( 8,9,10,11 ) . In center even complex surgery do mortality 0,1 % morbidity 15 % . Today , neither number , localisation metastasis extrahepatic tumour growth decisive resection , fact , possibilty complete tumor excision ( 12 ) . Especially developement neoadjuvant ( 13 ) adjuvant ( 14 ) chemotherapeutics one hand technical developement ( portal embolisation ( 15 ) , two-time resection ( 16 ) , virtual operation planning ( 4 ) , navigate surgery ( 17 ) ) hand enlarge number patient become resectable secondarily . The demand preoperative imaging increase technical therapeutical developements . In surgical technical prospect abdomen CT image still standard surgery planning , besides tumor imaging , good vascular anatomy image enables surgical strategy ( 5 ) . Today , 2D CT data use create 3D image liver vascularisation plan virtual surgery beneffiting especially complex surgery ( 18 ) . Because distinct good resolution lesion , MRI image liver high significance literature allow radiologists high quality diagnosis ( 19 ) , obligatory ease surgery planning surgeon ( 20 ) . A comparing study surgeon point view could show equal validity modality ( 21 ) . Interestingly , mentionend study show detection metastasis alter liver tissue ( fatty degeneration/ status post chemotherapy ) reduce . In difficult case CE-sonography give decisive information ( 22 ) . The practical disadvantage dependence examiner . Intraoperative sonography gold standard procedure operation , additional leasions detect may change resection strategy ( 6 ) . Even experience intraoperative ultrasonic probe able contrast enhancment , assume advantage use contrast medium sonography ( 23 ) operation room . The yet publish data enough ensure evidence . In point view necessary carry prospective study compare available state art image method add intraoperative contrast enhance ultrasound validate itÂ´s effect . In time limited resource become important lot difference cost image modality define optimal staging complex patient time enough value surgeon go forward operation . 3 . Design The Study concepted prospective , monocentric control observational study . 4 . Primary Endpoints : detection liver metastases intraoperative comparison preoperative information . Secondary endpoint : comparison detection-rates image method , comparison sensitivity image method comparison specificity image method . 5 . Caseload discussion statistical Analysis : As primary target figure number metastasis detect operation use ultrasound CT/MRI take consideration . It show average number liver metastasis detect use two procedure CE-IOUS CT/MRI different . On average use CE-IOUS method patient sample detect 1.95 metastasis , pre surgery detect 1.54 metastasis use CT/MRI . The standard deviation detect metastasis 1.10 . The null- alternative hypothesis key question : H0 : two procedure CE-IOUS CT/MRI detect number metastasis , H1 : CE-IOUS CT/MRI detect unequal number metastasis . It presume CE-IOUS method successful detection metastasis . To test two-sided question pair T-test average difference 0 regard absolute detection-number significance level 5 % stastistical power 90 % use . To able prove difference two method number 78 patient must evaluate . With respect 20 % rate drop-outs 98 patient recruit . 6 . Patient population : 98 patient suppose include study . Operation execution : first contact explain patient research plan . The case discuss interdisciplinary tumor conference . The next step image CT abdomen contrast medium sonography . Data CT finish 3D surgery planning . In next step carry MRI liver . Preoperative image method compare . Thus plan operative strategy . Intraoperative regular sonography supplement contrast medium ( lead extention 4 hour surgery 10 minute . Afterwards carry liver resection . Data image technique regard detection metastasis , specie delineation leasion , preoperative resection strategy well intraoperative change resection strategy collect data base . Patients provide care immediately discharge . Therefore , every six month send special consultation . The data gain subsequently test statistical significance evaluate ( MS Excel , SPSS ) . The result publish medical literature . For trail , plan use data patient period 18 month . Our hospital carry 80 liver resection every year hence able collect 98 patient colorectal metastasis . With amount gain meaningful analysis . 7 . There risk additional strain patient additional administration contrast medium MRI imaging . There possibility lead severe reaction body ( &lt; 1:100.000 ) treat medicinal . In opinion , risk due elongation 4 hour endure surgery 10 minute contrast medium sonography . This surgical morbidity liver resection procedure sonography . 8 . Possible benefit patient : With possibility optimal stag sequence high reliability use today image method patient benefit therapeutic measure high chance cure many might also spar unnecessary surgery . In medical literature still controversary discussion ideal image modality liver surgery . Here , different angle view encounter problem ( surgical/radiological view ) availability method ( CT/MRI ) cost . For advancement always complex interdisciplinary stamp treatment strategy colorectal liver metastasis vital use reliable image method respectively high significance combination method . The intraoperative contrast medium sonography promise significant benefit detection leasions detect far . In future patient may benefit lot thus get good prognosis . The exist data sufficient . Therefore , point view , important consider comparative consideration modality . 9 . Abruption criterion revocation accordance attendance trail patient factor , allow surgical intervention . 10 . Voluntary attendance countermand accordance The patient 's attendance project voluntary . The decision take part , interfere right sanitary protection attainment . The decision take part intervene Health protection claim service patient entitle . The patient way denounce legal claim right take part study . When patient make decision take part grant power withdraw revoke consent abort participation . 11 . Ethical basis study carry accord declaration 18th world medical association Helsinki , Finland 1964 late revision . The study present Ethic committee Hamburg careerlegal counceling . Possible subsequent change present Ethic committee assessment . 12 . Data privacy collect accord patient consent , particularly result , underlie discretion data privacy assignation . They record save paper format data medium Asklepios clinic Barmbek , department general visceral surgery . The use Data carry pseudonymously . A transmission data research purpose also do pseudonymously . The rule apply publication study- scientific result . These patient right demand information regard personal data possible personal result . Where appropriate head study scientific manager make decision .
