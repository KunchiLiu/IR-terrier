	<brief_summary>Little known chronic wound microenvironments , especially peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) diabetic patient . At demarcation line , percentage viable cell tissue unclear . A mean determine cell viability , particularly discern apoptotic necrotic cell pathway would indicate line demarcation drawn . The information generate would better predict clinical outcome use SPY Imaging . Cellular study need successfully confirm clear line demarcation eliminate surgeon subjectivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Determine Percent Tissue Perfusion Cellular Viability Using SPY Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , like central macrovascular disease , common diabetes . PAD lead critical limb ischemia , either alone combined injury like foot ulcer . The diabetic foot ulceration require adequate circulation heal ; circulation impair tissue oxygen demand exceed supply , critical limb ischemia ensues , place limb risk . Most often , patient critical limb ischemia , undergo multiple debridement operate room well vascular procedure , prior reach viable level amputation . This increase patient ' co-morbidities repetitive exposure anesthesia . Each debridement may remove viable tissue decrease length eventual amputation . Additionally , intraoperatively , viability skin edge subjective assessment base surgeon 's experience . That judgement inaccurate 10-20 % case lad reoperation . With use SPY imaging system , good assessment macrovascularity , also microvascularity tissue able evaluate objectively . This help identify tissue underperfused . The investigator unaware literature evaluate use SPY image low extremity intraoperatively amputation debridement . There many study publish use technology ophthalmic procedure , cerebral aneurismal repair , cardiac surgery breast reconstruction . In cardiac surgery , use ICG base image proven helpful assess quality bypass graft eliminate need radiography catheter insertion ( Reuthebuch et al. , 2004 ) . In ophthalmic procedure , ICG angiography fundamental identify many microvascular pathology ( Slakter , Yannuzzi , Guyer , Sorenson , &amp; Orlock , 1995 ) . Furthermore , neurosurgeon find use ICG angiography far superior DS angiography identify small vessel . As already proven good adjunct intraoperatively visualize microvasculature , investigator would like apply low extremity . Identifying underperfused tissue intraoperatively help surgeon objectively decide appropriate level amputation/debridement effectively minimize number revisional surgery . Also , study comprehensively evaluate compare effectiveness modality also attempt assess vascularity SPY imaging system . The information gain could pivotal help gain insight patient difficult heal wound , especially presence PVD .</detailed_description>
