	<brief_summary>An alternative general anesthesia - put patient completely sleep - regional anesthesia , local anesthetic inject skin freeze 'block ' nerve set nerve . This method allow patient awake surgery avoids unpleasant after-effects general anesthetic . A regional block normally perform insert needle skin needle tip near nerve block , follow injection single shot enough local anesthetic block sensation nerve normally provide . Although regional nerve block provide pain relief surgical procedure , eventually wear , occasionally leave patient contend localize pain part body operate . In case , over-the-counter painkiller like Tylenol Advil may strong enough completely take away pain . We believe , instead give single shot anesthetic , patient fit catheter - thin , flexible tube - use deliver one dose local anesthetic block nerve surgery could also use deliver second dose anesthetic prior discharge hospital . This way , patient still receive one needle poke , pain well manage follow surgery . Our study compare post-nerve block pain profile individual receive single-shot injection local anesthetic versus receive two dos via catheter delivery method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter-over Needle : Outpatient Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Local anesthetic ( LA ) may deliver single injection continuous infusion indwell catheter . A downside single-shot technique LA limit duration action , meaning , discharge , patient sometimes contend post-surgical pain limit activity reduces quality life . Occasionally , supplementary dose analgesic , morphine LA , administer , either intravenously via single injection . We speculate , rather use single injection , post-operative pain management may better control installing perineural catheter pre- intra-operatively , would allow flexible schedule LA delivery post-operatively enable clinician tailor analgesia regimen patient 's need . Our aim compare effectiveness double-shot anesthetic infusion - one block nerve another provide postoperative analgesia - conventional single-shot method control pain follow regional nerve block . Study objective : To assess value catheter-delivered supplementary infusion LA control postoperative pain regional block . Hypothesis : Patients receive regional nerve block experience less post-surgical pain second shot LA deliver perineural indwelling catheter prior discharge . Study procedure : We recruit patient schedule undergo surgery require regional block upper extremity . We anticipate recruit thirty individual ; control group receive one dose LA use conventional single-shot method , study group fit perineural catheter one dose LA deliver prior surgery another discharge hospital . On day surgery , participate patient take regional block area . Control group patient give single injection LA , ultrasound guidance , block appropriate target nerve ( ) . These patient undergo surgery post-anesthesia recovery per standard procedure . For patient experimental group , attend anesthesiologist , ultrasound guidance , insert perineural catheter appropriate location block target nerve . Once catheter place , single dose LA deliver block target nerve , catheter remain patient throughout procedure . In post-anesthesia recovery area , patient catheter receive second bolus infusion LA . When patient approve discharge , catheter remove , insertion site clean , patient allow go home . A research assistant ask patient rate pain use 0-10 numerical rating scale : 1 ) prior delivery first dose LA , 2 ) immediately follow surgery ( second anesthetic infusion experimental group patient ) , 3 ) immediately discharge hospital ( second anesthetic infusion experimental group patient ) . On day surgery , research assistant contact patient group ask rate pain 24-hour post-operative period . Pain report four time point provide u comprehensive assessment patient comfort regional nerve block whether second infusion LA effective alleviate post-operative pain . Primary outcome : 1 . Postoperative pain level 2 . Patient comfort home Inclusion criterion : Adult ; schedule surgery require peripheral nerve blockade . Exclusion criterion : Failure provide inform consent ; allergy LA ; neurological pathology and/or deficit block region .</detailed_description>
