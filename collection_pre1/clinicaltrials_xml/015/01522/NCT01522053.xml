	<brief_summary>When anesthesiologist perform regional nerve block , often put catheter - flexible plastic tube - patient allow continuous delivery local anesthetic . This allow nerve ( ) 'frozen ' patient comfortable surgery . The common method place catheter close nerve involves thread catheter needle inserted skin . Because catheter thin flexible , thread well tissue buckle kink enough force apply . Another problem puncture hole leave needle large diameter catheter , mean needle withdrawn , catheter secure , increase chance dislodge cause leakage local anesthetic . One solution problem use catheter placement method similar intravenous catheter instal . In method , catheter fit around ( 'over ' ) needle , result support catheter push skin . We wish examine catheter-over-needle method would useful place catheter deliver local anesthetic peripheral nerve blockade . We compare catheter-over-needle method currently use catheter-through-needle method patient require continuous anesthetic delivery surgery ; half patient receive anesthetic one method , half receive anesthetic method . We believe use catheter-over-needle method result secure placement catheter efficient delivery local anesthetic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter-over-needle : Inpatient Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Current needle-catheter assembly design flexible catheter thread large diameter needle towards target nerve . These catheter-through-needle ( CTN ) assemblies suffer several fundamental problem , include leakage insertion site dislodgement catheter . The underlie problem design needle puncture hole wider diameter catheter diameter . An alternative catheter-over-needle ( CON ) design , catheter diameter large needle puncture hole , may potential solution problem leakage dislodgement . We wish evaluate ease use effectiveness CON method clinical set anesthesiologist perform rate two technique administration local anesthesia various block site body . Study objective : To compare ease use effectiveness CON technique CTN method deliver continuous local anesthesia regional nerve blockade . Hypothesis : Insertion CON assembly catheter result secure accurate catheter placement efficient delivery local anesthetic compare catheter place use CTN method . Primary outcome : 1 . Time take place catheter near target nerve initial skin puncture . 2 . Confidence accurate catheter placement . 3 . Assessment catheter stability insertion site . 4 . Incidence anesthetic/fluid leakage catheter insertion site . Study procedures : This study involve recruit patient schedule undergo surgery require regional nerve block via local anesthetic delivery perineural catheter . We wish compare CON CTN catheterization method deliver local anesthetic common regional block . One hundred patient recruited assess usefulness CON method deliver local anesthetic . Patients study group receive continuous infusion local anesthetic CON catheter . Patients control group receive continuous local anesthetic CTN catheter . To make data collection easy , perform assessment several location Edmonton zone ; anesthesiologists location ask participate performing block record assessment two catheterization method . On day surgery , patient take regional block area , position appropriately block receive . Under ultrasound guidance , attend anesthesiologist install either CON CTN catheter . Each CTN catheter insert per standard procedure ; CON catheter insert similar fashion use intravenous catheter . The anesthesiologist give Part 1 survey evaluate catheterization technique . On survey , record duration time initial skin puncture placement end catheter near target nerve provide subjective evaluation confident accuracy catheter 's placement . Following connection continuous infusion local anesthetic , anesthesiologist record assessment catheter stability incidence anesthetic leakage around catheter insertion site . During postoperative period , anesthesiologist complete Part 2 assessment survey , record personal opinion CON method 's ease use value clinical setting . Inclusion criterion : Adult ; schedule surgery require peripheral nerve blockade Exclusion criterion : Failure provide inform consent ; allergy local anesthetic ; neurological pathology and/or deficit block region .</detailed_description>
