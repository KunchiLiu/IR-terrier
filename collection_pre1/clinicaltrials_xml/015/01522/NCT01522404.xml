	<brief_summary>The purpose study find atomoxetine cause change biologic marker ( substance may indicate presence disease ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) participant diagnose Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . In research study , spinal fluid subject MCI take atomoxetine compare spinal fluid take capsule contain inactive material , also know placebo . At six-month timepoint , subject take placebo first six month place active study medication , receive active study medication reassign placebo . After completion study , subject able receive open-label atomoxetine . This study also evaluate drug safe well-tolerated . Additionally , information gather identify dose atomoxetine beneficial , take medication affect think behavior , well image blood biomarkers . The result research help determine atomoxetine alters sign inflammation biomarkers associate Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>
