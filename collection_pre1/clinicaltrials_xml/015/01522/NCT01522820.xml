	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best schedule vaccine therapy without sirolimus treat patient cancer-testis antigen ( NY-ESO-1 ) express solid tumor . Biological therapy , sirolimus , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Vaccines make person 's white blood cell mixed tumor protein may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express NY-ESO-1 . Infusing vaccine directly lymph node may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether vaccine therapy work well give without sirolimus treat solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Sirolimus Treating Patients With NY-ESO-1 Expressing Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety DC205-NY-ESO-1 vaccine ( DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 ) without sirolimus . Toxicity define National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity : - Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ CD4+ T-cells . - Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibody . - Peripheral blood frequency CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) + regulatory T-cells . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore time disease progression . OUTLINE : Patients undergo standard collection peripheral white blood cell via leukapheresis 90-240 minute vaccine preparation . Patients assign sequentially Cohorts 1a-1d . COHORT 1a : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intranodally day 1 , 29 , 57 , 113 . COHORT 1b : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 Cohort 1a sirolimus orally ( PO ) day 1-14 , 29-42 , 57-70 . COHORT 1c : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 Cohort 1a sirolimus PO percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube day 15-28 , 43-56 , 71-84 . COHORT 1d : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 Cohort 1a sirolimus PO PEG day 1-84 . COHORT 2 : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 Cohort ( 1a-1d ) determine safe produce optimal immunological effect sirolimus PO day 1-14 Cohort 1b dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , 6 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
