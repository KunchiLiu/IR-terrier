	<brief_summary>This study design order collect data regard peri-implant tissue outcome abutment-supported restoration direct implant-fixed restoration . Therefore small group subject partly edentulous maxilla select show technique efficient safe show comparable peri-implant tissue outcome method . At time impression form centre treatment A ( = abutment-supported XiVE® CAD/CAM supra-structure ) B ( = direct implant-fixed XiVE® CAD/CAM supra-structure ) assign left right side maxilla randomize time impression forming .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan study profile ass peri-implant tissue outcome abutment-supported restoration direct implant-fixed restoration . Two treatment , Treatment A abutment-fixed supra-structure Treatment B , direct implant-fixed restoration , assess within scope clinical investigation . Treatment A : The XiVE® CAD/CAM supra-structure fixed abutment . The effect platform-switching discuss intensely scientific literature use order shift away connection implant supra-construction ( interface ) implant edge peri-implant tissue towards implant centre . However , implant-abutment-connection area potential entry port micro-organism direct influence state peri-implant hard soft tissue consequently long-term prosthetic implant success [ 8 ] . By use abutment connector implant supra-structure implies generation one micro-gap ( supra-structure abutment ) possible retention microbial plaque though locate hard tissue level . Treatment B : The XiVE® CAD/CAM supra-structure fix directly implant . In contrary treatment A , one entry port ( micro-gap ) micro-organisms exists : The interface supra-construction implant . So , one main point initial force main influence implant peri-implant tissue [ 8-10 ] . Besides , interface lie directly implant shoulder level osseous level . There displacement transitional area implant centre . This study design order collect data regard CAD/CAM system use DENTSPLY Friadent implant system XiVE® . In particular , peri-implant tissue outcome abutment-supported restoration direct implant-fixed restoration evaluate . Therefore small group subject partly edentulous jaw select show technique efficient safe demonstrate non-inferiority regard peri-implant tissue outcome technique . Each subject receive treatment , treatment A one site maxilla treatment B . The randomization method finally define subject receive one treatment leave maxilla region right maxilla area vice versa describe section 5.1 . In conclusion , treatment might pros con may affect peri-implant tissue outcome .</detailed_description>
