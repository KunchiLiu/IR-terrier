	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient patient prolonged unconsciousness need tube insert windpipe provide oxygen . This tube , call tracheostomy tube , connect ventilation device allow patient breathe . In hospital , doctor perform percutaneous tracheostomy ( PT ) , needle insert skin neck windpipe , provide guide tube dilate tissue create hole tracheostomy tube insert . Although common procedure critical care unit , carry risk patient always successful . The needle may puncture back side windpipe insert far , miss windpipe altogether , cause damage surround structure . We believe doctor perform PT would benefit method improves success rate procedure . We wish test device alert doctor perform PT needle tip air-filled windpipe . The device proven aid needle insertion cadaver , need test live patient . Since many intensive care patient undergo PT , wish test technique population . It control environment clinician experience PT . This technique save valuable time , result accurate needle insertion , lessen risk damage structure tissue neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrically Guided Needle Insertion : ICU Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Critically ill patient occasionally require tracheostomy tube breathe . A percutaneous tracheostomy perform , needle/catheter insert trachea , follow insertion guidewire tube dilate tissue , create hole tracheostomy tube . Although common procedure , pose risk patient , include accidental puncture nearby structure . We wish test device alert doctor needle tip tracheal lumen . The device proven aid needle insertion cadaver , need test live patient . Since many intensive care patient undergo PT , wish test technique population . Study objective : To evaluate effectiveness nerve stimulator aid needle tracheostomy live patient . Hypothesis : Nerve stimulation equipment help physician guide insert needle tip tracheal lumen faster accuracy conventional technique . Primary outcome : speed accuracy needle tip placement trachea . Procedure : This study involve recruit consent adult patient University Alberta Hospital General Systems Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) require percutaneous tracheostomy insert tracheal tube . In population , tracheostomy usually perform mean provide long-term assist ventilation without need endotracheal intubation . Briefly , patient sedate , skin neck disinfect , local anesthetic inject anterior neck . A bronchoscope insert endotracheal tube aid visualization localization needle puncture . The cricothyroid membrane locate palpate anterior neck incision make membrane . A small needle insert membrane act guide large needle-catheter assembly . Both needle remove guidewire insert catheter . Using forceps , insertion site widen tube dilate opening insert . The tracheostomy tube insert dilation tube guidewire remove . The endotracheal tube remove ventilation apparatus connect tracheostomy tube . We supply ICU physician commonly use nerve stimulator ( Stimuplex HNS 12 , B.Braun , Germany ) attach needle-catheter assembly use make first insertion trachea . The nerve stimulator connect current meter , ground electrode attach body . When needle tip contact body tissue ( i.e. , tracheal wall ) , electrical circuit close , produce read 1.0 mA current reader . Suspension needle tip airway interrupt circuit , produce read 0.0 mA . In addition , audible signal build nerve stimulator alert user change current , warn needle tip advance far contact posterior lateral tracheal wall . The physician perform percutaneous tracheostomy 20 ICU patient require endotracheal extubation insertion tracheostomy tube . This help support preliminary observation show nerve stimulator helpful guide needle insertion use human cadaver . By show technique equally effective used live patient , argue nerve stimulator similar device ensure accurate , quick , safe needle insertion access airway percutaneously . Inclusion criterion : Adult ; require tracheostomy Exclusion criterion : Failure provide consent ; know upper airway pathology ; know oro-pharyngeal laryngeal disease , include swell , tumour , infection ; previous radiotherapy operation neck ; cervical spine fracture .</detailed_description>
