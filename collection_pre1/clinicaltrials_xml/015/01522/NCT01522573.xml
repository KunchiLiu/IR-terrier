	<brief_summary>The purpose registry record information evaluate impact Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) Guided Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) management pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry evaluate efficacy , safety technical success Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) Guided Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) procedure . The safety efficacy various EUS-Guided ERCP procedure assess series study . This multi-center registry initiate : - To document impact EUS-Guided ERCP procedure management pancreatico-biliary disorder include malignancy . - To assess clinical technical success rate EUS-Guided ERCPs diagnostic therapeutic procedure . Design retrospective prospective registry study . Procedures capture include : 1 . EUS-Coils placement 2 . EUS Glue injection 3 . EUS-Fiducial placement 4 . EUS-Neurolysis 5 . EUS-Stent placement 6 . EUS-alcohol injection 7 . EUS-fluid collection , abscess cavity drainage 8 . EUS guide ductal drainage 9 . EUS-guided Ablation 10 . EUS-guided anastomosis 11 . EUS Guided ERCP gallbladder , pancreatic duct biliary duct drainage</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) Guided Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) become therapeutic intervention management biliary obstruction pancreatic stricture relate chronic pancreatitis disease . Successful biliary pancreatic cannulation achieve 90 97 % . Failure obtain biliary access relate operator experience , peri-ampullary diverticulum , prior surgery ( e.g. , Billroth II anatomy ) , tumor involvement ampulla , biliary sphincter stenosis impact stone . In experienced hand , pancreatic duct cannulation fail less 10 % case . This primarily relate surgically altered anatomy inflammation . Referral tertiary care center , percutaneous intrahepatic cholangiography ( PTC ) biliary decompression , surgical intervention typically offer failed ERCP . Percutaneous intrahepatic cholangiography subsequent percutaneous endoscopic drainage morbidity 32 % . Surgery also associate significant morbidity mortality . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) allow detailed image regional anatomy approximate frequency transducer region interest . With evolution linear array ability direct needle within field interest , therapeutic potential EUS reach new level beyond fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) , celiac plexus block drainage cystic lesion . The biliary pancreatic system , close proximity gastric duodenal lumen , logical target EUS case accessible ERCP . EUS-assisted cholangiopancreatography describe decade ago . In order validate procedure broaden use beyond tertiary center , crucial understand efficacy success rate . The objective study evaluate retrospectively prospectively efficacy safety EUS-Guided ERCP procedures diagnosis treatment pancreatico-biliary disorder . The purpose registry record information evaluate impact EUS-Guided ERCP management pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry evaluate efficacy , safety technical success EUS-Guided ERCP procedure . The involvement multi-international site crucial- advanced endoscopists outside US attempt similar complex EUS-Guided ERCPs complicate pancreatico-biliary case counterpart US . However , non-existence registry , case often report isolated case series remarkable technical similarity case series country . The registry hop combine comparable case collect enough relevant data statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
