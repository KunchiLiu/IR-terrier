	<brief_summary>Pacing lead key element pace system proper function one major factor affect long term performance whole system . Success pace lead implant define consider 3 item : ease lead implant , lead stability lead electrical performance . These factor may relate physician experience ( global implant experience , experience give lead ) , implant procedure ( lead access , lead position , implant time , scopy time ) lead ( handle mechanical characteristic ) patient ( ischemic history ) . Even though implant success rate quite high currently available lead , weight different factor influence success never study systematically . The objective current study define predictive factor implant success CapsureFix MRI model 5086 . This lead select available short period , investigator limit experience unique design make conditionally safe MRI environment may associate specific handle characteristic .</brief_summary>
