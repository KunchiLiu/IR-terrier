	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good bad , combination standard chemotherapy agent paclitaxel investigational ( experimental ) drug afatinib target HER2 , HER2-positive esophagogastric cancer start get big despite previous treatment trastuzumab . The doctor also study tumor understand grow trastuzumab treatment see effect afatinib paclitaxel tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically cytologically confirm esophagogastric cancer . HER2 overexpression and/or amplification determine immunohistochemistry ( 3+ ) FISH ( ≥2.0 ) Previously receive trastuzumab part regimen perioperative metastatic setting evidence progression 9Zrtrastuzumab use imaging agent 89Zrtrastuzumab PET permitted.. May previously receive lapatinib part regimen perioperative metastatic setting evidence progression disease . Washout period lapatinib 14 day . Completion previous chemotherapy regimen ≥2 week prior start study treatment . Other chemotherapy regimen may administer time progression prior trastuzumab contain regimen protocol therapy . No restriction prior chemotherapy regimen advance stage disease . At least one measurable metastatic lesion accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . Ascites , pleural effusion , bone metastasis consider measurable . Minimum indicator lesion size = 10 mm helical CT = 20 mm conventional technique . Pathological node must = 15 mm short axis consider measurable . Patients age 18 year old , dose adverse event data currently available use afatinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Life expectancy least three ( 3 ) month . Karnofsky performance status ≥60 % All patient disease technically amenable biopsy ask undergo biopsy . Patient must agree allow 2 biopsy malignant lesion access endoscopy aid radiology ( i.e . CT guide ) . Patients previously provide sample time trastuzumab resistance exempt biopsy start therapy . Consent preservation freeze fix sample tumor core evaluation Able swallow retain oral medication . Negative serum HCG pregnancy test premenopausal woman reproductive capacity woman less 12 month menopause . Willingness use birth control study . Asymptomatic , central nervous system metastasis permit . Patients receive concurrent anticancer therapy investigational agent intention treat esophagogastric cancer . 89Zrtrastuzumab us image agent 89Zrtrastuzumab PET permit . Prior disease progression docetaxel paclitaxel metastatic setting . Patients unwilling consent mandatory tumor biopsy . Patients archival tissue permit enroll study per MSK Principal Investigator discretion Women pregnant breast feeding . Concurrent radiotherapy permit disease progression treatment protocol ( except context specify section 9.0 ) , might allow preexist nontarget lesion approval principal investigator trial . Concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity , include ongoing active infection , history significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer ( congenital bleeding disorder , acquire bleed disorder within one year ) , HIVpositive . Subjects acute Hepatitis B eligible . Subjects chronic hepatitis eligible condition stable opinion investigator , consult , would pose risk subject safety . History presence clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormality uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure NYHA classification 3 , unstable angina poorly control arrhythmia . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry . Baseline ( &lt; 1 month treatment ) cardiac leave ventricular function rest ejection fraction le 50 % measure echocardiogram . Known preexist interstitial lung disease . Significant recent acute gastrointestinal disorder diarrhea major symptom e.g. , Crohn 's disease , malabsorption , CTCAEGrade &gt; 2 diarrhea etiology . Unwillingness give write informed consent , unwillingness participate , inability comply protocol duration study . Active hepatitis B infection , active hepatitis C infection Known HIV carrier Known suspect active drug alcohol abuse . Restricted Therapies Additional experimental anticancer treatment and/or standard chemo , immunotherapy , hormone treatment ( exception megestrol acetate ) , concurrent radiotherapy allow concomitantly administration study treatment ( exception list section 9.0 ) 89Zrtrastuzumab use imaging agent 89Zrtrastuzumab PET permit . Afatinib substrate Pgp plasma concentration affect use Pgp inhibitor ( data file ) also likely Pgp inducer could also influence afatinib plasma concentration . The use potent Pgp inhibitor ( include cyclosporine , erythromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , quinidine , Phenobarbital salt quinidine , ritonavir , valspodar , verapamil ) potent Pgp inducer ( include St John 's wort , rifampicin ) avoid treatment afatinib . Any exemption discuss principal investigator .</criteria>
