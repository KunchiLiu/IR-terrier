	<detailed_description>Abdominal fat , particular intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue , consider dyslipidemic atherogenic fat depot human body . Intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue total body fat measure precisely reliably laboratory set use advanced imaging technique ; however , reliable clinical measurement pediatric intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue total body fat yet develop . Thus , specific aim study 1 ) identify reliable landmark methodology measurement pediatric waist circumference associate intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue total body fat across pediatric age , total body adiposity , maturity range among African American Caucasian child adolescent , 2 ) determine waist circumference combination anthropometric index well predictor intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue total body fat waist circumference alone across pediatric age , total body adiposity , maturation range , 3 ) develop determine clinical utility pediatric race-sex-specific waist circumference threshold identification elevate chronic disease risk factor across pediatric age , total body adiposity , maturation range . The investigator accomplish aim conduct cross-sectional study 100 African American boy , 100 Caucasian boy , 100 African American girl , 100 Caucasian girl 5 18 year age . Waist circumference measure four common anatomic site use pediatric research : 1 ) superior border iliac crest , 2 ) midpoint iliac crest low rib , 3 ) umbilicus , 4 ) minimal waist . Additional body dimension obtain order determine clinical utility combine waist circumference measurement predict intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue total body fat , assess use advanced imaging technique . The identification appropriate waist circumference landmarks measurement technique important clinical identification child elevate obesity-related health risk standardization obesity surveillance strategy within country .</detailed_description>
