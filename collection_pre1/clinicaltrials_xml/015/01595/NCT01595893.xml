	<brief_summary>Polymorphic light eruption ( PLE ) common photodermatosis high prevalence approximately 11 21 % population . Similar lupus erythematosus ( LE ) , UV-inducible systemic autoimmune disease , PLE female preponderance mean onset second third decade life . PLE lesion itchy typically appear sun-exposed body sit spring early summer . The quality life patient PLE often severely disturbed , evidenced high level anxiety depression . For prophylaxis besides conventional sunscreen , photo ( chemo ) therapy effective many case , administer several week harden early spring first natural sun exposure take place . However , prolong treatment UVB and/or photochemotherapy potentially carcinogenic , search pathogenic mechanism new treatment option PLE ongoing . The exact pathogenesis PLE currently unknown finding suggest autoimmune-type background resistance UV-induced immune suppression simultaneous immune reaction skin photo-neoantigens . The investigator recently find PLE patient significantly reduce 1,25- ( OH ) 2-vitamin D3 serum level ( 13-14ng/ml ) compare normal population ( &gt; 30ng/ml ) . In addition , investigator able demonstrate intra-individual half-body trial topical administration immunostimulatory 1,25- ( OH ) 2-vitamin-D3 analogue calcipotriol reduce PLE symptom experimental study . In proposed randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial investigator attempt study effect oral vitamin D3 supplementation ( 2 x 40.000 IE , give orally two week apart ) PLE symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PLE patient subject experimental photo provocation solar simulate UV radiation several day vitamin D3 supplementation . Disease symptoms quantified newly establish validated PLE test score , ( AA + SI + 0.4P [ range , 0-12 ] , AA affect area score [ range , 0-4 ] , SI skin infiltration score [ range , 0-4 ] , P pruritus score visual analogue scale [ range , 0-10 ] ) . Optional biopsy take investigate effect oral vitamin D3 UV-induced skin test site , include cellular skin infiltration expression release cytokine situ endpoint . We also study effect oral vitamin D3 abnormality ) level function regulatory T cell , ii ) chemotaxis leucocyte , iii ) proinflammatory cytokine , i.e . alteration previously link PLE pathogenesis . This do ) FACS co-culture T cell proliferation assay , ii ) response peripheral neutrophil leucocytes chemoattractants leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine , iii ) ELISA immunobead assay patient serum . To back-up result obtain PLE test score upon experimental photo provocation study participant receive questionnaire PLE symptom quality life , adapted score previously describe . This questionnaire allow monitor PLE symptom quality life patient summer season follow oral vitamin D3 supplementation spring . The result project enlighten mechanism PLE may establish base novel prevention strategy via vitamin D3 pathway .</detailed_description>
