	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin work treat patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma vulva . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy cisplatin , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) achieve complete pathologic response use primary treatment locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma vulva . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy cisplatin , gemcitabine , IMRT achieve complete clinical response use primary treatment locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma vulva . II . To determine vulvar progression-free survival groin progression-free survival woman treat cisplatin , gemcitabine IMRT locally advance vulvar carcinoma . III . To determine toxicity surgical morbidity combine modality approach cisplatin , gemcitabine IMRT follow reduced-scope surgery treatment locally-advanced vulvar carcinoma . OUTLINE : Patients undergo IMRT 5 day week 6 week . Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute cisplatin IV 60 minute weekly 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 6-8 week completion chemoradiation patient undergo local core biopsy confirm response surgical excision gross residual disease vulva and/or inguinal-femoral lymph node . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
