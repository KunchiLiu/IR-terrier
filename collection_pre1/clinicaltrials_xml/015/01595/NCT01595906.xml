	<brief_summary>The use infantry helmet heavy heat stress condition , physical exertion , may hinder body 's ability effectively dissipate heat head area , thereby damage soldier 's function . Therefore head cooling may potentially enable long duration activity reach fatigue . An improvement function may also possible.The purpose research determine extent cognitive physiological strain cause wear helmet exertional condition expose heavy heat stress evaluate effect unique ventilation system connect helmet strain reduction .</brief_summary>
