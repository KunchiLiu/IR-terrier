	<detailed_description>Cerebral vasospasm generally occur due rupture brain aneurysm , ( rarely ) hemorrhage another blood vessel abnormality arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) . The common factor abnormal presence substantial amount blood outer ( `` subarachnoid '' `` adventitial '' ) surface blood vessel . This particularly affect artery base brain , i.e. , around Circle Willis . Depending severity , see use conventional angiography . Angiographic spasm tend readily detect 5-7 day SAH , although may detect early 3 day hemorrhage . It occur half two-thirds aneurysm patient depend time angiography carry . Clinical vasospasm occur approximately one-third patient suffer aneurysmal SAH . The essential problem vasospasm cause artery reduce blood flow completely shut . As result , part brain formerly supply artery effectively starve ( ischemia ) may die ( infarction stroke ) . Overall , cerebral vasospasm account approximately 20 % severe disability death associate ruptured aneurysm . If vasospasm detect early , patient treat balloon angioplasty reopen vessel infusion vasodilator administer ( typically verapamil nicardipine ) . Alternatively , concert treatment , one administer intravenous drug raise patient 's blood pressure ( `` pressor '' ) force blood narrow artery . Both treatment carry risk therefore administer unless vasospasm detect . Therefore , order prevent form brain injury enhance likelihood patient well , one need detect vasospasm become severe enough injure brain . Vasospasm detect sign observe physical examination patient radiological method cerebral angiography , Trans-Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasound . The physical exam sensitive vasospasm patient otherwise awake able participate neurological examination . Many patient subarachnoid hemorrhage keenly aware participative make clinical exam meaningful . Therefore clinical examination alone lack sensitivity . The gold standard method detect vasospasm cerebral angiography . This involve injection radiopaque dye arterial blood stream patient dye reach brain X-rays take . Although gold-standard diagnose vasospasm carry risk arterial injury even stroke , expense high . In addition contrast dye use study carry risk renal failure . As result , technology generally employ vasosapasm suspect Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) study . TCD bedside test relies ultrasound wave generate probe place skin head and/or neck region detect flow blood cerebral artery . It convenient , safe , frequently effective method use rapidly confirm clinical finding , much less invasive cerebral angiography . It , however , numerous technical limitation ; example , one detect vasospasm proximal vessel circle Willis therefore lack sensitivity . It also quite operator dependent limit patient appropriate skull thickness acoustic window . What need non-invasive , user independent , safe method detect cerebral vasospasm cause brain injury . The technology need simple use do bedside ICU environment . Such tool likely improve patient outcome initiating chain event mitigate vasospasm ( cerebral angioplasty initiation vasopressor therapy ) likely shorten length stay within Neuro ICU save hospital money . The Jan Medical NeuroWave simple , rapid , non invasive aid diagnosis vasospasm operator dependent limit skull structure . This study determine sensitivity , specificity predictive value Jan Medical NeuroWave System detect moderate severe vasospasm comparison Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) .</detailed_description>
