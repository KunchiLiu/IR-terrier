	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs small molecule recently discover cell . They know responsible normal development cell disrupt contribute development cancer . Many previous study do evaluate expression microRNAs normal tissue well wide variety cancer . Recently , microRNAs tumor cell detect circulate blood patient cancer . This present novel opportunity ass utility microRNAs blood early predictor cancer well marker response therapy . No previous study perform evaluate microRNAs archive tumor tissue blood patient Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF-1 ) . The investigator propose feasibility study evaluate presence microRNAs archive tumor tissue blood patient NF-1 . If investigator able identify circulate microRNAs population pediatric patient , build upon data propose future study .</brief_summary>
