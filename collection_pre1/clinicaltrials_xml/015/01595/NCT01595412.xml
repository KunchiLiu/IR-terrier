	<brief_summary>Background : Rectal prolapse ( RP ) descent upper rectum common problem western world . Surgery definite treatment preferably perform minimally invasive . High-level prospective study treatment strategy RP currently lack , thus , consensus exist regard optimal treatment patient RP . Furthermore , remarkable transatlantic difference exist , Europe , laparoscopic ventral rectopexy ( LVR ) regard treatment choice , USA Laparoscopic Resection Rectopexy ( LRR ) remain golden standard . Objective : To determine optimal minimally invasive surgical treatment patient RP . Design : International , prospective , comparative double cohort study . The first cohort consist 120 European patient RP treat LVR . Centres The Netherlands , Belgium UK enlist participation . The second cohort consist 120 American patient RP , treat LRR . Several US centre enlist . Preoperative work-up consist radiological imaging standardise questionnaire . Follow-up ( FU ) set two year . During FU , pre-operative imaging questionnaire repeat . Primary &amp; secondary outcome : Primary endpoint improvement Gastro-Intestinal-Quality-of-Life-Index ( GIQLI ) . Secondary endpoint generic Quality-of-Life , functional result , morbidity , mortality , recurrences cost-effectiveness . Time frame : Study inclusion start January 1st , 2011 take approximately 18-24 month . Therefore , total study duration 42-48 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Rectal Prolapse ( RP ) , procidentia , descent upper rectum . This descensus full-thickness rectum , either internal , call internal rectal prolapse intussusception ( IRP ) , anus ( call external rectal prolapse ( ERP ) ) . RP mainly occur woman ( 80-90 % ) 6-7th decade . Risk factor develop rectal prolapse presence abnormal deep pouch Douglas , laxity atonic condition muscle pelvic floor anal canal . Moreover , weakness internal external sphincter , often evidence pudendal nerve neuropathy lack normal fixation rectum may lead RP . This also frequently lead pelvic organ prolapse like vesicoceles , enteroceles genital prolapse . In study investigator focus treatment RP . Rectal prolapse cause anal incontinence half patient . Another frequent symptom RP constipation . Furthermore , rectal prolapse lead anal pain result incarceration lead ulcer , necrosis perforation . Besides fact disease considerable impact individual quality life , also carry significant socio-economic consequence incontinence product use large amount .</detailed_description>
