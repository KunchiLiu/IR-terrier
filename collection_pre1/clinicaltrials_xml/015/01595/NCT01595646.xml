	<brief_summary>The study examine effect intranasally administer long-acting insulin detemir cognition person Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) . The rationale study derive grow evidence insulin contribute multiple brain function , insulin dysregulation contribute AD pathogenesis . Thus , therapy aim restore normal insulin signal CNS may beneficial effect brain function . Intranasal administration insulin increase insulin signal brain without raise peripheral level cause hypoglycemia . Insulin detemir insulin analogue may better action brain insulin formulation albumin bind property . The investigator test therapeutic effect intranasally-administered insulin detemir study participant receive insulin detemir , regular insulin , placebo four month period . The investigator test hypothesis insulin insulin detemir improve memory daily function person AD/aMCI compare placebo , insulin detemir great effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well-known insulin , hormone naturally secrete pancreas , play important physiological role regulate blood sugar level body . Researchers know insulin play many important role brain well . Insulin seem especially active part brain corresponds learn memory . Studies show people insufficient insulin brain ( , example , case Type-II diabetes ) , increasingly risk develop memory problem Alzheimer 's disease . In past study , investigator administer intravenous insulin participant find improves memory . However , particular method would practical intervention people Alzheimer 's disease due risk hypoglycemia exacerbation insulin resistance . Instead , investigator use `` intranasal '' method administration , insulin inserted device , administer intranasally . In method , insulin travel directly brain , bypass body . Past study also demonstrate reliable way improve memory , change body 's blood glucose level . In past study , investigator use regular insulin , last 3-4 hour create similar `` spike '' insulin one would eat meal . However , normal physiology , pancreas also release small constant `` pulse '' insulin throughout day night , establish base level insulin . Accordingly , several longer-lasting type insulin available last close 10-12 hour , mimic basal level insulin . The current study use long-lasting type insulin call `` insulin detemir , '' determine learn memory benefit consistent supplement insulin . The investigator want determine whether treatment benefit people already memory impairment—either diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , condition precedes Alzheimer 's disease . The investigator examine cognition , daily function , cerebral blood flow , different marker Alzheimer 's disease blood cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) outcome measure . The investigator specific aim : 1 . We test hypothesis compare placebo , four month treatment intranasal insulin insulin detemir improve cognition function adult AD MCI , great effect observe insulin detemir . 2 . We examine effect intranasal insulin insulin detemir cerebral blood flow adult AD MCI . 3 . We examine effect intranasal insulin insulin detemir CSF Aβ , tau inflammatory marker adults AD MCI . To examine hypothesis , investigator recruit approximately 90 participant diagnose AD mild cognitive impairment . They randomly select take placebo ( saline ) , insulin detemir , insulin . Cognition , level daily functioning , glucose tolerance , cerebral blood flow test begin study drug , 16 week study drug . Some participant also undergo lumbar puncture begin study drug 16 week take study drug . Statistical analysis follow intent-to-treat ( ITT ) approach ; , subject analyze original randomize group regardless adherence group assignment . A completer analysis also perform , include subject successfully complete treatment phase . Missing data handle use multiple imputation linear regression . We conduct secondary analysis measure cognition , daily function , cerebral blood flow , CSF biomarkers . For ASL-MRI , follow coregistration processing , parametric map generate determine regional CBF value treatment group . Secondary analysis also examine treatment duration ( 2-month vs. 4-month ) relevant outcome . All model adjust age index peripheral insulin sensitivity ( derive 120-minute OGTT glucose insulin value ) statistically warrant , posthoc contrast perform appropriate . Secondary analysis also evaluate whether treatment response cognition , daily function , CSF plasma marker , insulin differ accord APOE4 genotype . Although analysis exploratory due possible limited APOE4 treatment arm cell size , data examine statistical trend warrant exploration large trial . Other secondary analysis examine association among treatment-related outcome use score derive multiple regression data collect treatment phase residualized respect baseline value .</detailed_description>
