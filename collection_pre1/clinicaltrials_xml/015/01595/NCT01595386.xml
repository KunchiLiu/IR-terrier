	<brief_title>Effect Postop Steroids Cardiovascular/Respiratory Function Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) induce acute systemic inflammatory response ( SIRS ) via synthesis release inflammatory mediator . These inflammatory cascade may result development capillary leak generalize tissue edema , associate multiorgan dysfunction involve myocardium , lung , kidney , pancreas , central nervous system . Neonates especially susceptible injurious effect SIRS . In attempt blunt post-bypass SIRS , neonatal heart program protocols patient receive preoperative and/or intraoperative steroid . Despite widespread use , study demonstrate consistent benefit therapy , neonate often continue suffer deleterious effect SIRS postoperatively . Only one study design evaluate impact prophylactic postoperative steroid administration outcomes neonatal CPB . The early postoperative period crucial time attenuation CPB-induced SIRS exogenous steroid may lead improved clinical outcome . Adrenal insufficiency neonates post-CPB may accentuate harmful effect SIRS diminish anti-inflammatory hemodynamic stabilization benefit endogenous cortisol . Evidence suggest neonate may suffer inadequate cortisol activity relative severity illness post-CPB , part relate immaturity hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . This so-called critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency ( CIRCI ) may contribute low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) , respiratory dysfunction , capillary leak postoperative period . Much support CIRCI contributor LCOS CPB originate small clinical study demonstrate benefit exogenous steroid supplementation various short term clinical outcome patient shock . Yet clear benefit exogenous steroid suggest dysregulation HPA axis whether merely alternative effect steroid . Investigators recently begin describe cortisol response neonates post-CPB , consensus regard incidence clinically important adrenal insufficiency , identification , receive exogenous steroid .</detailed_description>
