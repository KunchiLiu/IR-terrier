	<brief_title>Validation Laparoscopic Score Predict Chance Optimal Cytoreduction Advanced Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results large retrospective study clearly demonstrate RT primary surgery important prognostic factor AOC patient . Subsequently , several study show complete cytoreduction ( RT=0 ) associate statistically significant long survival rate minimal residual disease ( RT=1-2 cm ) . As consequence , maximal surgical effort consider main goal pursue patient . However , data literature show certain percentage AOC patient , variable 10 80 % , still consider inoperable time primary surgery , submit unnecessary xipho-pubic laparotomy . This approach , beside affect QoL , related complication delay start chemotherapy . This result related series variable , include patient 's performance status , philosophy centre skillness surgeon . Finally , anatomic diffusion disease describe one limit factor optimal cytoreduction . In order preoperatively identify patient unresectable tumor , spar unnecessary exploratory laparotomy , several approach attempt , include CA 125 serum level CT-scan . However , accuracy parameter unsatisfactory , limited retrospective nature study highly variable rate optimal cytoreduction different series . Laparoscopy well-known offer direct magnify vision peritoneal cavity well view upper abdomen . It allow pathological assessment disease without open surgical procedure , short operating time well result term post-operative morbidity . We first demonstrate pilot study laparoscopy alone able provide information regard chance optimal cytoreduction ( RT &lt; = 1cm ) standard laparotomy clinically AOC patient . Since , investigator confirm role laparoscopy evaluation possibility achieve optimal residual disease clinical subset . However , one major criticism study represent surgeon subjectivity evaluate optimal debulking relation surgical team operate room performance . Consequently , basis previous publish paper , set quantitative predictive model , provide patient score , take account several laparoscopically-assessed site disease objectively predict chance achieve optimal cytoreduction . This model give parameter ( omental cake , diaphragmatic carcinosis , peritoneal carcinosis , superficial liver metastasis , stomach infiltration , bowel infiltration mesenteric retraction ) value 2 ( see `` Statistical consideration '' ) . Finally , undertook study validate performance model large prospective series AOC patient . For laparoscopic parameter discuss agree characteristic able define positive evaluation , especially identify critical area surgical resection . This study confirm PI cut-off &gt; 8 , percentage inappropriate `` exploration '' 0 , percentage unnecessary exploration equal 40.5 % . In conclusion laparoscopic subjective ability predict optimal cytoreduction definitively turn objective score . Moreover , laparoscopic score ( Fagotti 's score ) validate externally centre different one develop [ 19,20 ] , demonstrate predictive quality PI remain unchanged even apply different population centre , surgical background . This report suggest limit subjectiveness , characterize evaluation ovarian cancer spread , tend solution . Study design Phase I 1 . Patients clinical/radiological suspicious primary advance ovarian/peritoneal cancer undergo follow pre-operative staging examination : haematological chemical parameter , include CA 125 serum level , thorax-abdomen-pelvis CT-scan . 2 . If inclusion criterion satisfy , informed consent sign surgical procedure . 3 . Patients submit open laparoscopy least one ancillary trocar evaluate seven parameter previously describe , assign one score obtain global predictive index . PI score calculate base . A video register . 4 . Patients'characteristics , include histological diagnosis , report enclosed summarizing schedule . On hand , additional information regard follow treatment patient , i.e . abandon vs. upfront surgery , RT follow require preliminary phase 1 . 5 . Send Laproscopic form , pre-operative document Video coordinate centre . For preliminary phase 1 , minimum number 10 patient enrol one year . Time number case increase reach establish accuracy rate &gt; 80 % . The fairness laparoscopic PI value obtain specific centre establish revision film material coordinate centre accuracy calculate realize 10 case . The centre achieve accuracy rate &gt; 80 % enter second phase study . Other centre require case achievement objective . All enrol patient receive expect treatment consider intention-to-treat-population ( ITT ) . Participation preliminary Phase I study necessary sufficient pre-requisite adhere Phase II . A new approval Ethical Committee need enter Phase II . Centres withdraw study time , write explanation require . Phase II Only centre participate Phase I enter Phase II trial , achieve accuracy rate &gt; 75 % . A new approval Ethical Committee need enter Phase II . 1 . Patients clinical/radiological suspicious primary advance ovarian/peritoneal cancer undergo follow pre-operative staging examination : haematological chemical parameter , include CA 125 serum level , thorax-abdomen-pelvis CT-scan . 2 . If inclusion criterion satisfy , informed consent sign surgical procedure ( Appendix 1 ) . 3 . Patients submit open laparoscopy least one ancillary trocar evaluate seven parameter previously describe , assign one score obtain global predictive index . PI score calculate base Appendix 2 . No videos need register . 4 . Patients'characteristics , include histological diagnosis , report enclosed summarizing schedule ( Appendix 3 ) . In case additional information regard follow treatment patient , i.e . abandon vs. upfront surgery , RT site , type surgical procedure need obtain optimal cytoreduction , follow data require ( Appendix 4 ) . 5 . Send Appendices 2 3 coordinating centre . For phase 2 study , minimum number 100 patient enrol two year , overall . Results regard primary objective study obtain immediately enrolment patient . Secondary objective study need least minimum follow-up 3 year .</detailed_description>
