	<brief_summary>Biomarkers small molecule detect body fluids patient ; often correlate presence cancer . MicroRNAs proteins small molecule recently discover cell . They know responsible normal development cell disrupt contribute development cancer . Many previous study do evaluate expression microRNAs proteins normal tissue well wide variety cancer . Recently , microRNAs protein tumor cell detect circulate blood patient cancer . This present novel opportunity use microRNAs protein blood early predictor cancer well marker response therapy . Previous work lab identify miRNAs protein blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) pediatric patient brain tumor . To determine longitudinal evaluation presence microRNAs proteins blood , cerebrospinal fluid urine patient central nervous system tumor diagnosis course treatment . Though duration active treatment varies significantly base upon diagnosis , patient follow 24 month enrollment onto study ) .</brief_summary>
