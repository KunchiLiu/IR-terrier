	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Objective 1 : To advance investigator understand effect solifenacin succinate ( 10 mg OD ) vs. fesoterodine ( 8mg OD ) urinary urgency use validated Urgency Severity Impact Questionnaire ( USIQ ) . Hypothesis 1.1 : The severity urgency symptom measure USIQ change differently woman OAB follow 3 month treatment solifenacin succinate ( 10 mg OD ) vs. fesoterodine ( 8mg OD ) . Hypothesis 2.1 : Condition-specific quality life ( QOL ) measure USIQ change differently woman OAB follow 3 month treatment solifenacin succinate ( 10 mg OD ) vs. fesoterodine ( 8mg OD ) . Objective 2 : To advance investigator understanding adverse event ( AE 's ) solifenacin succinate ( 10 mg OD ) vs. fesoterodine ( 8mg OD ) . Hypothesis 1.1 : The severity rate AE 's woman OAB follow 3 month treatment solifenacin succinate ( 10 mg OD ) vs. fesoterodine ( 8mg OD ) different .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Solifenacin Succinate Versus Fesoterodine A Comparison Trial Urgency Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Overactive Bladder Evaluation ( NOBLE ) Program estimate prevalence OAB US nearly 17 % affect approximately 30 million adult . Sixty-one percent adult OAB also urge urinary incontinence ( UUI . Urinary urgency key symptom OAB . Urgency may bothersome patient urinary frequency , although urinary frequency often primary focus study field OAB . This may partially due controversy surround define term 'urinary urgency ' . As currently define , urgency meant describe abnormal sensation distinguishable normal feel `` urge void , '' occur normal bladder-filling cycle . Attempts measure urgency confound difficulty understand definition context normal `` urge '' void . This controversy probably arise overlap English word 'urge ' 'urgency ' clinical conversation , apparently give rise confusion language . Recently new validated questionnaire measurement urgency symptom validate [ 5 , 6 ] . The USIQ consist two part initial filter question , designate self-administration . The first 5 item , know USIQ- severity ( USIQ-S ) , inquire urgency symptom severity , second part USIQ- quality life ( USIQ-QOL ) consist 8 question inquire bother condition specific QOL : cooping behavior , work , commute travel , sleep , physical activity , social activity , psychological well-being , relationship sexual function . Items scale sum transform score range 0-100 . Higher symptom bother score indicate increase symptom bother , high USIQ-QOL score indicate bad health relate quality life . The main objective current study compare effect two different anticholinergic medication symptom urinary urgency use validate , subjective instrument design specifically purpose .</detailed_description>
