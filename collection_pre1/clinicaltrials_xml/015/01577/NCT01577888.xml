	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Study Shockwave Lithoplasty System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shockwave Medical , Inc. intend conduct prospective , single-arm , single-center , First Human study design evaluate early safety feasibility Shockwave Lithoplasty System subject heavily calcify infrainguinal artery 3.75mm 6mm reference vessel diameter target site . The Shockwave Lithoplasty System indicate generate sonic shockwave energy within target treatment site disrupt calcium within lesion allow subsequent dilation peripheral artery stenosis use low balloon pressure . Up 10 subject enrol undergo lihtoplasty .</detailed_description>
