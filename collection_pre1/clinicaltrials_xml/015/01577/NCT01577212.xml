	<brief_title>Individualized Dose Prescription Advanced Stage Lung Cancer Patients Using Modern ( Chemo ) Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands , approximately 10.000 new patient diagnose lung cancer every year . Of , 80 % present non-small-cell lung cancer . Between 1995 2008 , national incidence rise 16 % cause impressive increase 53 % woman suffer disease . The aggressive nature disease lead one-year survival rate 45 % 5-year survival rate 14 % . It widely accept surgery provide best chance cure patient operable NSCLC ( www.oncoline.nl ) . In practice , 20 % patient amenable tumor resection curative intent . Alternatively , stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) result excellent local control localize early stage disease . In locally advanced , inoperable disease , combine chemotherapy external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) increasingly use . Evidence suggest concurrent schedule effective sequential treatment despite increased toxicity , although true magnitude additional benefit remain uncertain . However , large number patient locally advance NSCLC suitable concurrent chemoradiotherapy due general condition , age , comorbidity tumor-related factor . Therefore , need increase effectiveness treatment patient advanced stage NSCLC undergo either radiotherapy alone , neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow radiotherapy , concurrent treatment . Apart addition chemotherapy , treatment modification intensification radiotherapy schedule dose escalation proven beneficial . Several phase I/II trial explore altered EBRT fractionation schedule increase biological effective dose primary tumor reduce local relapse rate . Thereby , two main principle pursue : reduction dose per fraction ( ≤ 1.8 Gy ) , give two three fraction per day ( so-called hyperfractionation ) , aim spar normal tissue increase dose primary tumor ; increase fraction dose ( ≥ 2 Gy ) , combine reduction total number fraction ( so-called hypofractionation ) aim increase effective tumor dose less radiation-sensitive primary tumor . On one hand , hyperfractionation limit treatment-related side-effects , hypofractionation attractive patient radiation department number treatment fraction reduce . Intensification irradiation schedule continuous , hyperfractionated radiotherapy ( CHART ) deliver 12 consecutive day show absolute improvement two-year survival . With advent highly conformal dose planning delivery technique last decade ( i.e. , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy , 3D-CRT ; intensity-modulated radiation therapy , IMRT ; volumetric-modulated arc therapy , VMAT/RapidArc ; Tomotherapy ) , organ-sparing technology become widely available . Recently , van Baardwijk collaborator publish individualized dose prescription study 166 stage-III NSCLC patient . Already 2006 , Belderbos et al . report favorable toxicity data encourage failure-free interval 88 inoperable NSCLC patient treat intensified , hypofractionated 3D-CRT base MTD lung . Apart report study , three hypofractionation trial conduct elsewhere . In UK , two 3D-CRT base phase I/II trial approve investigate individualize dose escalation base normal tissue dose constraint patient stage II stage III NSCLC ( ISRCTN12155469 I-START ; CRUK/10/005 ) . In US , University Wisconsin conduct helical tomotherapy-based hypofractionation study ( NCT00214123 ) pulmonary toxicity ( pneumonitis grade 3 last 2 week ) primary endpoint . The report hypo- hyperfractionation study 'trial-and-error ' approach dose-level estimation common . In recent silico trial 26 stage III NSCLC patient , investigate use dedicate software tool individual dose escalation hypofractionation . Based exist , clinical IMRT/VMAT treatment plan ( 66 Gy 33 fraction ) , radiation dose escalate scale radiation dose maximum tolerate dose constraint healthy lung , esophagus , spinal cord , brachial plexus heart meet . The aim present study test feasibility toxicity individualize hypofractionated radiotherapy , report outcome data . In case phase II trial favorable result , phase II/III trial maximally tolerable , individualized , hypofractionated radiotherapy within short overall-treatment time aim .</detailed_description>
