	<brief_summary>Patients high complexity severe chronic disease require several admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) overcome acute exacerbation use assist ventilation . In last 10 year , new technology bed ICU evidence new group patient often need wean procedure due long-lasting period mechanical ventilation . These patient often chronic condition recurrent symptom , reduce effort tolerance depression . Weaning process frail step medical history patient survive acute episode respiratory failure spend period time mechanical ventilation . Patients follow duration in-hospital stay , expect average period 4 week . When discharged fron Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) wean center , patient usually manage GPs hospital admit follow re-exacerbations . The conventional approach sure inadequate type patient whose clinical complexity , disability frailty need continuity care higher complex approach management . A structured program Home Rehabilitation could possible solution problem . Thus , hypothesis study evaluate feasibility sustainability efficacy home rehabilitative network prolong weaned patient discharge wean unit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients refer Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri prolong wean enrol trained individualised program home care order recover autonomy . Home care compare 2 arm : usual care vs physiotherapist ( PT ) -assisted care . Usual care consist support drug oxygen therapy , mechanical ventilation , GP 's assistance , periodical in-hospital visit . The PT-assisted home care support PT least 2 times/month , autonomous 50 min physical activity/working day help DVD . The physical activity consist cyclette , calisthenic exercise , train respiratory muscle . Few brief educational lesson PT precede training activity . Every two week , PT call patient phone educational reinforcement .</detailed_description>
