	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effects GSK573719/VI Combination GSK573719 Monotherapy Subjects With Moderate Hepatic Impairment Matched Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK573719 develop monotherapy combination vilanterol treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . This study ass pharmacokinetics safety inhale GSK573719/ vilanterol ( VI ) GSK573719 healthy subject subject moderate hepatic impairment . Nine subject moderate hepatic impairment recruit , together nine match healthy volunteer . There possibility use patient impaired hepatic function pharmacokinetics inhale GSK573719 GSK572719/VI may alter . The result study therefore provide guidance use GSK573719 GSK573719/VI moderate hepatically impair patient .</detailed_description>
