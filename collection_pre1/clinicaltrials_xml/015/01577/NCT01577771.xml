	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate immunogenicity reactogenicity 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among infant , toddler child Bobo-Dioulasso , Burkina Faso . Infants randomize receive vaccine 6 , 10 , 14 week 6 week , 14 week 9 month age . Serotype-specific serum IgG , OPA nasopharyngeal colonization assess 6 week , 18 week , 9 month 10 month age . Toddlers 12-15 month age randomize receive either single dose PCV13 2 dose 2 month apart . Serotype-specific serum IgG OPA measure pre-dose 1 3 month later . Children 2 4 year age receive single dose PCV13 IgG OPA assessments pre-vaccination 1 month post-vaccination . The immunogenicity reactogenicity PCV13 `` standard schedule '' group ( e.g . 6 , 10 , 14 week infant single dose toddler ) compare observed PCV13 licensure trial . Within age group alternative schedule compare standard schedule term immunogenicity impact nasopharyngeal carriage ( infant ) .</brief_summary>
