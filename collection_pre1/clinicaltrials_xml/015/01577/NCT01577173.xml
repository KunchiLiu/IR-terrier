	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label , randomize study evaluate efficacy safety MEHD7945A versus cetuximab patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck progress follow platinum-based chemotherapy . Patients randomize receive either MEHD7945A 1100 mg intravenously ( iv ) every 2 week cetuximab 400 mg/m2 iv load dose follow 250 mg/m2 iv weekly . Patients treat cetuximab ( Arm B ) may cross-over MEHD7945A ( Arm A ) upon central confirmation progressive disease upon meet eligibility criterion . Anticipated time study treatment disease progression intolerable toxicity occur .</brief_summary>
