	<detailed_description>Dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) second common cause neurodegenerative dementia . In early stage , differential diagnosis DLB Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) challenging . The differential diagnosis particularly important give patient DLB respond well cholinesterase inhibitor show sensitivity neuroleptic medication contraindicate DLB . DLB tend progress quickly Alzheimer 's disease . Diagnostic accuracy may improve . Oculomotor recording , easy perform could helpful order identify reliably assess fluctuate attention performance DLB patient . Main objective : - improve differential diagnosis DLB AD early stage disease oculomotor measurement Secondary objective : - examine association oculomotor record neuropsychological examination assess attention ability fluctuation - evaluate benefit complementary neuropsychological test distinction DLB AD case - examine relationship hippocampal volume neuropsychological examination DLB case - examine diagnostic performance MRI ( Support Vector Machine ) DLB AD - examine interest CSF alpha synuclein concentration discriminate DLB AD - ass one year variation oculomotor test score neuropsychological test score Method design Longitudinal multicenter study include 100 patient DLB AD diagnosis . Clinical examination one year .</detailed_description>
