	<brief_summary>The principal aim study determine objective response rate offer second-line treatment pazopanib patient carcinoma advanced renal cell progress tolerate first line treatment Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor . The secondary aim determine overall survival treatment safety profile patient second-line treatment pazopanib . The exploratory aim determine correlation biomarkers patient blood tumor sample , clinical result obtain pazopanib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Second-line Therapy Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients progress tolerate first-line treatment Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor include consecutively study . All patient receive treatment regimen consist 800 mg / day pazopanib monotherapy . All patient receive treatment evidence progression , evidence unacceptable toxicity , compliance , investigator clinical decision consent withdrawal patient . After treatment , patient enter follow-up period . During period investigator collect information subsequent administer treatment survival patient , regardless reason withdrawal , every 8 week schedule end follow-up period , accord protocol . At 30 day treatment completion , first follow visit schedule assess possible occurrence late toxicity . In patient complete treatment prior objectify progression , information progression disease collect .</detailed_description>
