	<brief_summary>Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) currently best treatment wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . To work , drug must inject mean intravitreal injection ( IVT ) vitreous ( jelly-like material ) cavity back eye , repeatedly interval range one several month . Endophthalmitis rare devastate infection eye occur approximately 0.2 % patient IVT injection . Many ophthalmologist ask patient use antibiotic eye drop IVT injection hope may reduce risk endophthalmitis . There proof happen possible risk repeat exposure antibiotic may cause antibiotic resistance organism ( bacteria ) develop time . The investigator hypothesize repeat exposure antibiotic initial stage treatment AMD result progressive shift conjunctival flora increase number antibiotic resistant organism appear time . If demonstrate , change prevail treatment approach need reduce long term risk patient develop antibiotic resistant endophthalmitis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intraocular injection VEGF inhibitor repeat basis become standard care treatment Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) follow pivotal study demonstrate vision could stabilize 90 % treated patient . Most patient require injection , average , every two month indefinitely . The incidence intraocular infection ( endophthalmitis ) follow intraocular injection approximately 0.2 % . Current injection protocol involve use topical poviodine prior injection base evidence significantly reduce bacterial flora conjunctiva . Following injection often reflux vitreous fluid cavity eye subjunctival space . For reason many Ophthalmologists patient use topical antibiotic 2-3 day post injection expectation may reduce risk infection eye healing . Ta et al demonstrate follow 3 day course topical antibiotic incidence resistant strain bacteria conjunctival sac significantly increase ( 159 patient ) .There longitudinal study examine effect repeat short term antibiotic exposure conjunctival flora time . This prospective , randomize , comparative study follow conjunctival flora patient undergoing induction treatment VEGF inhibitor AMD . The incidence resistant organism group receive antibiotic compare similar group receive antibiotic . Following informed consent , patient conjunctival swab take treat Ophthalmologist instillation sterile topical anesthetic application poviodine . The swab culture thyoglycollate broth . Bacteria present resistance antibiotic use identify . This process repeat visit induction phase treatment consist four sequential injection month apart . Patients antibiotic arm ask use topical Moxifloxacin drop 4 time day 3 day follow injection . The control group receive antibiotic .</detailed_description>
