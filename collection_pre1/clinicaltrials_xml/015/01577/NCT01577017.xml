	<brief_title>The Effects Letrozole And Clomiphene Citrate For Induction Ovulation In Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrinopathy among woman reproductive age group one lead cause infertility . It characterize chronic anovulation hyperandrogenism variable clinical manifestation include oligomenorrhea , infertility , hirsutism , acne ( Ehrmann DA 2005 ) . Several method describe induce ovulation PCOS patients- weight reduction , laparoscopic ovarian drilling use various induction ovulation agent like clomiphene citrate ( CC ) , aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) gonadotrophins . Clomiphene citrate ( CC ) widely use standard drug treatment infertility . It known clomiphene citrate result ovulation rate 60-85 % , conception rate around 20 % ( Bayar et al 2006 , Sohrabvand et al 2006 ) . About 20-25 % woman resistant CC ovulate . Discrepancy ovulation pregnancy rate relate anti-estrogenic activity endometrium cervical mucus due CC long half life 5 7 day . In view disappointing result CC treatment many adverse effect cost possible complication gonadotrophin , concept aromatase inhibition propose new method ovulation easy use , less expensive effective drug . Letrozole oral , potent , reversible , highly selective aromatase inhobitor prevent androgen-to-estrogen ( E ) conversion . These aromatase inhibitor short half life ( 45 hour ) , hence rapidly eliminate body . No adverse effect E target tissue see letrozole due short half life ; furthermore , regulate ER compare CC . The main impetus development aromatase inhibitor ovulation induction agent avoid peripheral antiestrogenic effect CC , especially frequent occurrence thin endometrial lining ( Sohrabvand et al 2006 ) . Rationale perform study As medication i.e . CC letrozole show effective inducing ovulation PCOS patient , study perform order evaluate regime ( whether CC letrozole ) best use first line treatment PCOS patient infertility local population . The best regime therefore could include protocol management infertility patient PCOS quality patient ' care could improve . HYPOTHESIS Letrozole effective clomiphene citrate ovulation agent PCOS patient . General Objective To compare effectiveness letrozole clomiphene citrate ovulation agent PCOS . Specific Objectives . To identify ovulation percentage letrozole CC ii . To compare endometrial thickness letrozole CC iii . To determine pregnancy outcome letrozole CC iv . To study associated factor affect effectiveness treatment e.g . age , body weight , smoking , duration marriage , duration infertility type infertility either primary secondary ) Methodology 1.0 Study design Prospective , multicenter , randomize control trial . 2.0 Population sample Reference population The reference population female patient diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome infertility clinic HSB , Kedah infertility clinic HUSM , Kelantan infertility Clinic , Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan ( HTAA ) , Kuantan , Pahang . 3.0 Selection criterion 3.1 Inclusion criterion . Age &gt; 18 year &lt; 40 year old ii . Was diagnose PCOS iii . Patient illiterate . iv . Normal husband 's seminal fluid analysis ( SFA ) - ( Count &gt; 20 million/ml , Motility &gt; 40 % normal morphology &gt; 30 % ) 3.2 Exclusion criterion : . Having medical problem eg- renal disease , tyhroid disorder , hyperprolactinemia , liver disease . ii . Other cause anovulatory infertility 4.0 Sampling Sample size 4.1 Sample size Sample size calculation : 1 . Ovulation percentage From Hananel Holzer 2006 Proportion ovulation rate use Clomiphene citrate ( Po ) = 0.60 Proportion ovualtion rate use Letrozole ( P1 ) = 0.84 P = P1 + Po = 0.83 + 0.64 = 0.72 zα = 1.96 zβ = 0.84 80 % power 2 2 Significance level ( α ) = 5 % ( 0.05 ) Power study ( 1 - β ) = 80 % β =20 % ( 0.2 ) n = ( zα√2P ( 1-P ) + zβ√P1 ( 1-P1 ) +Po ( 1-Po ) ) 2 ( P1-Po ) 2 n = ( 1.96√2 ( 0.72 ) ( 1-0.72 ) + 0.84√0.83 ( 1-0.84 ) + 0.60 ( 1-0.60 ) ) 2 ( 0.75 - 0.50 ) 2 n = 54 Therefore sample size = 108 + 20 % drop = 130 By use PS software - sample size : 130 2 . Endomterial thickness letrozole CC From Mosammat Rhasid et al 2008 Letrozole 2.5 mg , mean ± SD ratio -10.37 ± 1.2 CC 100mg , mean ± SD ratio - 9.03 ± 0.89 - - 0.5 n = 2 α2 ( zα + zβ ) 2 - 2 = 2 ( 1.2 ) 2 ( 1.96 + 0.84 ) 2 ( 0.5 ) 2 = 49 per group Therefore sample size = 98 + 20 % drop Total n = 117 By use software , n = 51 per group , total n = 122 3 . Pregnancy rate letrozole CC From Mosammat Rashida Begum 2008 Letrozole 2.5mg - pregnancy rate - 40.6 % CC 100mg - pregnancy rate - 18.7 % ( Po ) = 0.18 ( P1 ) = 0.41 P = P1 + Po = 0.41 + 0.18 = 0.30 zα = 1.96 zβ = 0.84 80 % power 2 2 Significance level ( α ) = 5 % ( 0.05 ) Power study ( 1 - β ) = 80 % β =20 % ( 0.2 ) n = ( zα√2P ( 1-P ) + zβ√P1 ( 1-P1 ) +Po ( 1-Po ) ) 2 ( P1-Po ) 2 n = ( 1.96√2 ( 0.30 ) ( 1-0.30 ) + 0.84√0.41 ( 1-0.41 ) + 0.18 ( 1-0.18 ) ) 2 ( 0.41-0.18 ) 2 n = 61 Therefore sample size = 120 + 20 % drop n= 146 - The maximun sample size calculate study 146 . Therefore sample size decide study = 150 patient 4.2 Sampling frame All PCOS patient attend Infertility Clinic Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah ( HSB ) , Kedah , Infertility Clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia ( HUSM ) , Kelantan Infertility Clinic Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan ( HTAA ) , Kuantan , Pahang fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study . 5.0 Methods data collection The study conduct approval Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah , Kedah , USM HTAA , Pahang ethical committee . All PCOS patient , age 18 year old Gynecology Clinic , HUSM give information form regard study conduct . When participant agree involve study , consent form give . Participants require fill social demographic data include age , address , occupation , monthly family income , education status , duration marriage , number parity year last child birth . Measurement waist circumference , weight , height blood pressure reading record . Then patient randomize two group Randomization PCOS woman eligible fulfil criterion study recruit . After give inform consent , assign one group seal opaque envelope label C L. Women group C assign CC 100mg L assign Letrozole 2.5 mg . The randomization do computer- generate randomization use http : //www.randomization.com accord random sequence . Group 1- Letrozole group - The patient give letrozole 2.5 mg D5-D9 menses . - Base line TVS D2 do , follow spontaneous menses/induction MPA 10 mg Daily 1 week . - Transvaginal scan do document evidence ovulation patient menses ( D8 -10 onwards ) . - If dominant follicle ( DF ) present ( DF &gt; 12mm ) , repeat TVS every 2 day , - ovulation diagnose mature DF 18 22 mm evidence rupture 3 4 day later If dominant follicle ( DF ) absent ( DF &lt; 12mm ) , repeat TVS every 3-4 day later . - Measure Endometrial thickness ( ET ) every follow-up . - If absent Dominant follicle ( DF &lt; 12mm Days 20 ) , consider failed anovulation . Group 2 Clomiphene Citrate Group - The patient give CC 100 mg D5-D9 menses . - Base line TVS D2 do , follow spontaneous menses /induction MPA 10 mg Daily 1 week . - Transvaginal scan do document evidence ovulation patient menses ( D8 -10 onwards ) . - If dominant follicle ( DF ) present ( DF &gt; 12mm ) , repeat TVS every 2 day , - ovulation diagnose mature DF 18 22 mm evidence rupture 3 4 day later - If dominant follicle ( DF ) absent ( DF &lt; 12mm ) , repeat TVS every 3-4 day later . - Measure Endometrial thickness ( ET ) every follow-up . - If absent dominant follicle ( DF &lt; 12mm Days 20 ) , consider failed anovulation . In group urine pregnancy test do 3 week document ovulation patient remain amenorrheic . All study medication discontinue positive pregnancy test . Pregnant patient follow ultrasound could document viability pregnancy . Copies patient ' obstetric record , include delivery record , review investigator obtain obstetrics outcomes e.g : miscarriage , ectopic pregnancy , molar pregnancy , preterm delivery etc ) .
