	<brief_title>The Use Diluted Povidone Iodine Irrigation Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative infection spine surgery extensively investigated literature . These investigation focus efficacy use peri-operative antibiotic , Povidone Iodine skin preparation , effect shave around surgical sit , use intra-operative diluted Povidone Iodine wound irrigation prevent post-operative infection . Povidone-iodine complex polyvinyl pyrrolidine tri-iodine ion widely use antiseptic agent . It bactericidal activity wide spectrum pathogen , include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . The safety use intra-operatively evaluate animal study also support Randomized Controlled Trials spinal surgery surgical subspecialties . The purpose study evaluate efficacy intra-operative use dilute Povidone Iodine solution reduce post-operative infection use irrigate surgical incision spinal surgery compare 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation Solution ( i.e . normal saline solution ) . The primary outcome measure see reduction number post-operative infection . As result although directly measure , suspect reduction post-operative infection may result quick heal few complication pain .</detailed_description>
