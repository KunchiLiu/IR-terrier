	<brief_title>Oral Probiotics Reduce Group B Streptococci Colonization Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group B streptococci ( GBS ) colonize vagina rectum 10-30 % pregnant woman . In newborn , GBS lead cause neonatal sepsis major cause pneumonia meningitis . Intrapartum penicillin G prophylaxis aim prevent early-onset group B streptococci ( GBS ) sepsis interrupt vertical transmission . According Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) guideline 2002 , minimum 4 hour intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis generally recommend prevent early-onset group B Streptococcous ( GBS ) less 4 hour may achieve adequate level drug . Even valiant effort , frequently GBS-positive mother arrive labor floor deliver few 4 hour , especially multiparous mother . Preliminary study well data large health maintenance organization demonstrate 40-50 % GBS-colonized woman receive antibiotic least 4 hour delivery due rapidity labor . Newborns GBS-positive woman present labor unit deliver receive 4 hour intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis deem `` risk '' recommend undergo blood culture , complete blood count , 48 hour observation . This problem easily resolve antibiotic treatment pathogen ; thus , tranditional approach patient management need re-evaluated . Probiotics define live micro-organism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host . Probiotics show displace kill pathogens modulate immune response interfere inflammatory cascade lead preterm labour delivery . Lactobacilli dominant bacteria vaginal flora possess antimicrobial property regulate urogenital microbiota . Incomplete cure recurrence genitourinary infection lead shift local flora predominance lactobacilli coliform uropathogens . Use Lactobacillus-containing probiotic restore commensal vaginal flora propose treatment prophylaxis bacterial urogenital infection . The actual mechanism action probiotic vagina probably multifactorial . The production lactic acid , bacteriocin , hydrogen peroxide seem important , modulation immunity another possible mechanism . The administration Lactobacilli mouth intravaginally , show safe effective reducing , treating , , urogenital infection . For pregnant woman , restoration could important prevent BV low risk PTL Daily use oral gelatin capsule contain dry viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 show decrease e risk bacterial vaginosis maintain normal lactobacilli vaginal flora . These organisms antagonistic growth adhesion various intestinal urogenital pathogen include Salmonella typhimurium , Shigella sonnei , E coli 0157 , toxic shock Staphylococcus aureus , group B streptococci , Enterococcus faecalis , G vaginalis , uropathogenic E coli . In animal study , strain find safe pregnancy enhance health mother newborns . Studies way Toronto , Ont , test effect strain bacterial vaginosis pregnant woman risk preterm labour . These lactobacillus might also role prevent vaginal colonization group B streptococci , organisms cause serious illness even death newborn . Certain lactobacilli inhibit growth adhesion streptococci vitro , whether vivo untested . This study prospective double blind randomize clinical trial . Vaginal rectal GBS screening culture carry pregnant woman 35-37 week gestation OPD . Subjects vagina rectum GBS colonization invite participate study inform consent . A total 200 pregnant woman participate study 12-months trial period . They randomly assign one two group . The study group treat two oral capsule probiotic daily ( sleep ) 14 day , control group take 2 capsule placebos . Vaginal rectal GBS culture repeat participators 2 week later . All participators treat accord GBS guideline CDC 2002 labor . Much current literature investigate potential probiotic prevent bacterial vaginosis preterm labor , usefulness use probiotic surrogate adjunctive therapy intra-partum antibiotic prophylaxis GBS colonize pregnant woman dose . This first study investigate role probiotic prevent treat vaginal colonization GBS pregnant woman . The purpose study examine whether oral take Latobacillus-containing probiotic reduce GBS colonization rate vagina rectum pregnant woman present GBS-positive . Through result study , try investigate role probiotic prevent unnecessary test , admission antibiotic treatment newborn GBS-positive mother deliver few 4 hour labor . We hope result may effect GBS sepsis protocol .</detailed_description>
