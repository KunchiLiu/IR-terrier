	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder three distinct component : airway hyper-responsiveness ( respiratory hypersensitivity ) , airway inflammation , intermittent airway obstruction . One characteristic disease inflammatory reaction immune system cause cytokine production . A substantial number asthma patient satisfactorily respond steroid therapy consequently unmet medical need novel target therapy improve specificity , tolerability , compliance . Novel therapeutic strategy treatment chronic inflammatory disease target early disease-causing mechanism promise approach treatment asthma . The transcription factor GATA-3 play key role mediate asthmatic immune response show necessary sufficient production cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -4 , IL-5 , IL-13 . The active drug substance investigational medicinal product SB010 hgd40 . SB010 belong new class antisense oligonucleotide therapeutic , 10-23 DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) zymes ( antisense oligonucleotide ) . DNAzymes catalytically active nucleic acid cleave complementary RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) molecule . By cleave GATA-3 mRNA , hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production thereby reduce key feature allergic airway inflammation . DNAzymes generate completely chemical synthesis produce Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) control condition . The DNAzymes biological drug , i.e . generate use live organism include cell culture bacteria . The molecule highly water-soluble applied solution directly synthesize form . The current study evaluate safety tolerability increase single dos inhale SB010 male patient asthma airway hyperresponsiveness ( demonstrated methacholine bronchial challenge test ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult male Caucasian patient age 1845 year ( include ) . Clinical diagnosis mild moderate , stable , persistent intermittent asthma ( accord GINA guideline revise version 2010 ) least 6 month prior screen . Positive skin reactivity screen within last 12 month least one allergen variety seasonal nonseasonal specific allergen ( e.g . pollen , animal epithelium , dust mite ) . Patients concomitant treatment , except shortacting betaagonists inhale topical corticosteroid stable dose , able change current asthma therapy , discontinue prescribe anticholinergic , leukotriene receptor inhibitor , longacting beta 2agonists signature inform consent per require washout period . Screening forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) value &gt; 60 % predict normal value washout least 8 hour shortacting beta 2agonists , 72 hour longacting beta 2agonists , whatever applicable . Predicted normal value use calculation purpose base European Community Steel Coal predict value . Patients must demonstrate PC 20 response methacholine concentration ≤4 mg/mL screening . ( PC 20 = Concentration agonist inhale substance lead fall FEV1 20 % ) . Predose FEV1 value 20 % reference absolute FEV1 value measure screen [ i.e . 0.8 x FEV1 ( screen ) ≥FEV1 predose ] . Patient inform verbally write objective clinical trial , method , anticipate benefit potential risk discomfort may expose , give write consent participation trial prior trial start trialrelated procedure . Except asthma atopic disease like allergic rhinitis atopic dermatitis assess healthy base screen examination include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , ECG assessment , pulmonary function testing , clinical laboratory result .

Ability inhale appropriate manner ( patient train inhale AKITA2 APIXNEB® device placebo medication screen visit ) . The patient must agree : use two method contraception combination female partner , childbearing potential ; combination contraceptive method must use screen least 6 month last dose Investigational Medicinal Product . At least one contraception method must barrier contraception method . Contraceptive method allow include follow : condom , diaphragm combination spermicide , intrauterine device well female partner oral contraception , contraception implant , OR sexually active screening accept use doublebarrier contraception become sexually active within 6 month last dose Investigational Medicinal Product , OR surgically sterilize prior screening accept use barrier method contraception well , OR partner postmenopausal last natural menstruation least 24 month prior screen , OR partner hysterectomy prior screening , OR partner surgically sterilize prior screen Presence clinically significant disease asthma atopic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , hematological , neurological , genitourinary , autoimmune , endocrine , metabolic , etc ) , , opinion investigator , may either put patient risk participation trial , disease may influence result study patient 's ability take part .

Hospitalisation emergency room treatment acute asthma 3 month prior screen , screen start treatment period . Intubation ( ever ) hospitalisation longer 24 hour management asthma exacerbation within precede 3 month screen visit . History allergic reaction active inactive ingredient nebuliser solution . ECG abnormalities clinical relevance ( e.g. , QTc accord Bazett 's &gt; 440 m , PR ≥210 m ; QRS ≥120 m ) . Patients rest heart rate &lt; 45 bpm &gt; 90 bpm , systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg &gt; 140 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mmHg &gt; 90 mmHg . Proneness orthostatic dysregulation , fainting , blackout . History presence malignancy except basalioma . Clinically relevant abnormality clinical chemical , haematological laboratory variable . Chronic clinically relevant acute infection . Positive result follow virology test : Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis B core antibody , Hepatitis C antibody , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 , HIV 2 antibody .
