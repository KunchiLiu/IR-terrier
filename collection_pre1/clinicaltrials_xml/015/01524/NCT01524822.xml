	<brief_summary>Background : - Repeated exposure explosion may lead change way people think feel . Breachers ( people train use explosive get building ) expose repeat blast part job . Researchers want study might affect blast exposure . Breachers compare group different level exposure repeat blast . Information also obtain spouse close companion . Objectives : - To study effect repeat exposure low-level blast think , memory , behavior , brain function . Eligibility : - Experienced military civilian breachers , experience active duty artillery operator , active duty military without frequent blast exposure , 18 60 year age . - Spouses close companion individual . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect urine pregnancy test require participant ( companion ) MRI scan . - Participants spend 5-days NIH clinic outpatient , 6 hour test day . Tests include follow : - Medical professional history , question exposures blast - Tests think , memory , concentration - Balance test - Hearing test - Imaging study , magnetic resonance imaging , look brain - Overnight sleep study monitor brain wave - Blood sample - Participants return 1 year later 3-day followup visit . Some test repeat . A spouse close companion ( available ) ask complete questionnaire telephone interview .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Chronic Exposure Low-Level Blasts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate cognitive neurophysiological effect chronic exposure repeat low-level blast overpressure . Previous study show converge evidence neurophysiological effect cumulative exposure blast , consistent subjective report cognitive impairment individual train use explosive gain entry structure ( breachers ) . This study expand finding examine large cohort experience breachers may incur cumulative effect low-level blast exposure course several year . We evaluate 20 participant three group : breachers , artillery control personnel , unexposed individual . Additionally , ask bring close companion set questionnaire interview capture change function participant may able self-assess . Participants travel NIH evaluation cognitive neurophysiological measure . The procedure include neuropsychological testing , blood analysis biomarkers , vestibular auditory testing , neuroimaging study use diffusion tensor imaging , susceptibility weight imaging , perfusion imaging , image Gadolinium contrast , functional magnetic resonance imaging , , evidence sleep disorder , polysomnography . Participants also invite back 1-year , follow-up assessment look progression change difference control group . This study conduct collaboration Naval Medical Research Center ( NMRC ) Walter Reed Army Institute Research ( WRAIR ) Research Collaborative Agreement ( RCA ) . The complementary DoD protocol review DoD IRB include NIH protocol . The complementary DoD protocol include data collection field setting , activity NIH engage describe protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : EXPERIMENTAL GROUP : BREACHERS Active duty prior active duty military personnel civilian law enforcement personnel Ages 18 60 ( age range active duty military population ) At least 4 year experience breach profession actively involve breacher train and/or operation ( minimum annual exposure ) . An alternate criterion year breacher experience exposure significant number breaching blast , specifically , exposure 400 breaching blast within career , consider experienced investigator . CONTROL GROUP 1 : ARTILLERY Active duty prior active duty military personnel Matched experimental group ( breachers ) term age , gender , operational experience . Operational experience define year experience actively involved artillery operation and/or number artillery evolution . At least 4 year experience exposure concussive environment relate blast ( minimum annual exposure ) . An alternate criterion year experience exposure significant number concussive evolution , specifically , exposure 400 within career , consider experienced investigator . CONTROL GROUP 2 : UNEXPOSED Active duty prior active duty military personnel law enforcement personnel Matched experimental group ( breachers ) term age , gender , operational experience . Operational experience define year experience actively involved military law enforcement operation condition operation include direct mission engagement roles rather support role . Military deployment law enforcement patrol examples direct mission engagement role shore logistics office base call center examples support role . COMPANION GROUP Spouse , close family member , live partner experimental control group participant . The criterion meet person historical knowledge participant routine interaction outside work environment . Over 18 year age Knowledge experimental control group participant daily function Companions unable travel NIH may participate remotely ( offsite companion ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : BREACHERS History moderate severe brain injury loss consciousness great 5 minute Current diagnosis CNS disorder ( mild severe ) Any cardiac , respiratory , medical condition may affect cerebral metabolism MRI contraindication Metal body would make MRI scan unsafe , pacemaker , medication pump , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve cochlear implant ) , shrapnel fragment , permanent eye liner small metal fragment eye Claustrophobia Inability lie supine 2 hour MRI scanner CONTROL GROUPS 1 &amp; 2 : ARTILLERY &amp; UNEXPOSED Parallel exclusion criterion breacher group , addition exposure breach blast ( great 40 individual blast ) Artillery Group exposure blast ( great 40 individual blast ) Unexposed Group .
