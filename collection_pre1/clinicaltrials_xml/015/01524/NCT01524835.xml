	<brief_title>Live Lung Donor Cross-sectional Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over time , number patient lung transplant wait list number lung transplant perform greatly increase . Unfortunately , number patient wait list outpace transplant rate , result significant number death patient wait list . Live lung donation potential decrease wait time lung transplant rate death await transplant . However , since live lung donation typically utilize one lobe lung two donor , transplantation put two donor risk adverse event . Although live lung donation begin early 1990s , still great lack publish comprehensive , long-term study , leave outcome live lung donation unclear . This study assess post-donation outcome live lung donor . Specifically , investigator determine effect live lung donation lung function , quality life , morbidity , psychosocial status , satisfaction live lung donation , decision-making associate live lung donation . Information obtain study allow potential future live lung donor interested public become well informed , may also assist potential donor decision-making process regard procedure . Furthermore , positive study result could potentially reassure previous live organ donor uncertainty concern future health . There 369 participant recruit study base live lung donation , occur 1993 2006 . Study coordinator contact eligible participant invite participant study answer question . Participants option partially completely refuse participation . Each consent donor complete series questionnaire via phone mail . The question address issue relate donor 's quality life , morbidity , psychosocial status , satisfaction live lung donation , decision-making associate live lung donation . The questionnaire take one hour complete . The coordinator offer assistance regard questionnaire completion return . At end study , final brief status update obtain via phone interview . In addition questionnaire , participant also ask participate spirometry test . For consent participant , spirometry test schedule either two study site approve Pulmonary Function Laboratory . During test , participant breathe plastic tube machine measure amount flow air donor breathes . If deem appropriate , participant test minute give albuterol , drug aim optimize lung function . Spirometry test last hour .</detailed_description>
