	<brief_summary>Patients metastatic locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) develop resistance two hitherto approve drug disease , tyrosin kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) imatinib sunitinib , poor prognosis . Sometimes response may achieve drug , mainly TKIs , explore different study yet approve clinical use . Pazopanib TKI inhibit tyrosin kinase KIT , PDGFRA , VEGF 1-3 , important role pathogenesis GIST . Theoretically , may function GIST , deserve investigational trial . The drug approve metastatic renal cancer relatively well tolerate . In trial ( SSG XXI ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) = ( CR+PR+SD ) 12 week treatment assess primary endpoint , time trough level measure . Secondary endpoint include ORR , PFS , toxicity , disease control rate relation trough level week 12 relation primary mutation tumor ( know ) . The goal include 72 patient trial , open single arm .</brief_summary>
