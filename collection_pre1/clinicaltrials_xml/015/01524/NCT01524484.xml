	<brief_summary>Data quality clinical anesthesia important improvement quality patient safety field . Routine quality data often collect professional busy patient care . This study examine reliability routinely collect quality data compare electronic anesthesia record respective report quality-indicating event , i.e . whether event anesthetic ( e.g. , drop blood pressure , irregular heart rhythm , others ) actually report . Additionally , interview report staff ( physicians nurse ) perform gain insight possible obstacle report work process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reliable quality data important basis attempt improve quality safety patient care . For anesthetic practice Switzerland , `` Absolute Minimal Data Set '' ( AMDS ) preoperative patient characteristic intra- postoperative quality indicator provide Institute Social Preventive Medicine ( IUMSP , University Lausanne ) cooperation Swiss Society Anaesthesiology Reanimation ( SGAR-SSAR ) . Data electronically forward participate institution IUMSP , whereas primary collection achieve traditional paper record electronic record part anesthesia information management system ( AIMS ) . In investigator 's institution , physician nurse anesthetist suppose use window electronic anesthesia record purpose . This form complete end case . If event accord AMDS definition occur least anesthesia , respective box ( e.g. , `` intraoperative hypotension '' ) tick form . The anesthesia record close unless quality form fill , notably do even advance `` quick '' tick `` event '' . Considering numerous duty anesthesia staff end case , investigator question reliability data generate busy phase . A pilot study 50 consecutive unselected case year 2010 reveal low rate reporting ( 10.8 % ) select perioperative event relate anesthesia ( specifically : hypotensive , hypertensive , bradycardic , tachycardic , hypoxemic episode ) . Consequently , current extensive study representative sample size initiate . To gain insight possible cause ( among others : time pressure , unclear definition , fear litigation ) , interviews anesthesia staff perform hopefully provide basis possible improvement . For time consider common nature possible cause , investigator suspect result may specific institution . The incidence perioperative event may grossly underestimated process data collection properly design monitor .</detailed_description>
