	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people feel pain bone marrow aspiration ( collection ) . Studies suggest pain may relate different kind inflammation , presence nitric oxide ( normally occur gas ) body . Researchers want study nitric oxide level blood breath bone marrow collection . They look level relate feeling pain . Objectives : - To good understand pain relate bone marrow collection . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age enrol study require bone marrow collection . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood sample . - Participants provide study blood breath sample check nitric oxide level . Participants also test measure skin sensitivity heat touch . - During collection , participant keep track pain level . - After collection , participant keep track pain medication take . They also record eat food contain nitrate 24 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abstract : This project explore biochemical mechanism associate acute pain produce bone marrow aspiration 36 healthy subject : 1 ) Evaluation strong relationships NO metabolism ( measure plasma nitrite , nitrosated protein , cyclic GMP , plasma hemoglobin , reticulocytes , well marker inflammation ) level acute pain healthy subject ; 2 ) Identification differentially express gene proteins marker nature severity pain bone marrow aspiration . Elucidation relationship may identify novel target intervention lead attenuation pain , improve treatment less impact quality life ( QOL ) may identify potential mechanism role NO inflammatory pain syndrome . Objectives : The first objective study characterize genetic expression acute pain pain free phase pre post bone marrow aspiration ( BMA ) . The second objective measure multiple time point level exhale Nitric Oxide ( eNO ) biomarkers subject pre- post BMA . The third objective evaluate acute experimental pain perception subject . Population : This study recruit healthy subject ( N=36 ) agree donate bone marrow . Design : This prospective , exploratory study sensory affective pain healthy volunteer . Participants undergo evaluation ( eNO , blood collection , quantitative sensory test ) clinic visit undergo bone marrow aspiration . Importance : The purpose study improve understand biochemical molecular genetic mechanism associate acute pain healthy population characterize leukocyte transcriptome pain pre- post BMA . It hypothesize analysis transcriptome result panel biomarkers correlate acute pain healthy population . The successful elucidation relationship may identify novel target intervention lead attenuation pain , improve treatment less impact quality life functional status .</detailed_description>
