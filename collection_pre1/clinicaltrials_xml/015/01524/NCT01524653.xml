	<brief_summary>Patients cancer high risk develop venous blood clot thromboembolism ( VTE ) . In effort target patient high risk VTE thromboprophylaxis ( protective treatment blood clot ) , numerous study identify serum biomarkers risk future VTE . There also increase evidence point prophylactic effect statin therapy risk develop VTE high-risk population include patient advanced cancer . The purpose research study find whether treatment rosuvastatin ( study drug ) reduce risk VTE patient cancer receive chemotherapy . This study specifically investigate impact rosuvastatin therapy serum biomarkers ( D-dimer others ) indicate risk VTE , well safety tolerance rosuvastatin therapy population . This phase II randomize crossover study two 3-4 week treatment period enrol patient receive 20 mg rosuvastatin day mouth match placebo tablet . Approximately two tablespoon blood collect biomarker analysis begin end treatment period . After first treatment period 3-5 week break subject undergo washout . Following washout period every subject `` crossover '' begin take alternative therapy everyone enrol receive study drug either first second treatment period . Biomarker level analyze treatment period compare baseline , every patient act control .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patient &gt; 18 year old locallyadvanced metastatic cancer start already receive systemic chemotherapy target therapy . Estimated overall survival ≥ 6 month Anticipated duration therapy ≥ 9 week ( 3week cycle ) ≥ 12 week ( 2 4week cycle ) . Systemic therapy allow change necessary , terminate , period Antithrombotic therapy include warfarin , dabigatran , low molecular weight heparin unfractionated heparin . Patients take aspirin may participate study . Antiangiogenic therapy thalidomide lenalidomide . Patients receive bevacizumab may participate study . Patients start hormonal therapy exclusively , SERM aromatase inhibitor therapy breast cancer , androgenablative therapy prostate cancer . Statin use within 3 month prior enrolment Adjuvant therapy patient already receive curativeintent local therapy ( surgery radiotherapy ) . Patients glioblastoma start adjuvant chemotherapy exception give high likelihood residual disease risk VTE population . Asian descent assess history . If either participant 's parent Asian ( people East , Southeast , South Asia ) , patient exclude due slow metabolism drug concern regard toxicity 20 mg dose level . Urinary creatinine clearance le 40 ml/min base report MDRD GFR , present FAHC metabolic profile report , 14 day screen period . AST ALT elevation great 3X upper limit normal , 14 day screen period . Patients known history statin intolerance accompany severe adverse reaction . Patients currently participate another clinical trial involve investigational medication know suspected drug interaction rosuvastatin statin class , investigational agent know suspect associated significantly increase risk thrombosis .</criteria>
