	<brief_summary>Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) use medically assist procreation , induce ovarian stimulation woman . However , FSH dose inject quite hard adjust , excess exogenous hormone could lead severe complication patient . This hormone act cognate receptor , FSHR , present granulosa cell surface , regulation involve intra-cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus domain . The investigator first aim research c-terminus part receptor presence allelic variant could explain variation response FSH stimulation . The investigator also would want complete data already know functionally determinant single nucleotide polymorphism 680 position c-terminus part hFSHR . Then , investigator would analyze entire sequence hFSHR patient present unusual phenotype response FSH treatment , order detect potential mutation involve receptor functionality . The result study could allow u increase knowledge hFSHR physiology functionality , order adjust treatment genetic profile patient .</brief_summary>
