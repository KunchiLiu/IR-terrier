	<detailed_description>Double-balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) introduce 2001 visualize entire small bowel . 2008 , novel balloon enteroscope system develop use single balloon ( single-balloon enteroscope , SBE ) . SBE design facilitate diagnosis treatment small bowel . We could demonstrate endoscopic procedure equally suitable clinical routine . In balloon-assisted endoscopic procedure ( balloon-assisted enteroscopy ( BAE ) ) mandatory insufflate gas bowel secure good visualization . All endoscope use GI endoscopy provide gas insufflation unit . Currently , many endoscopy unit use air purpose . The use air , however , far ideal insufflation GI endoscopy . During GI endoscopy , significant amount air usually retain bowel segment inspect . This air pas GI tract exit physiologically rectum . Thus , abdominal pain discomfort examination due retention air show common endoscopic procedure . Carbon dioxide gas ( CO2 ) , unlike air , rapidly absorb bowel . Within minute , several liter CO2 absorb GI tract . The use CO2 show result comfortable examination colonoscopy flexible sigmoidoscopy several randomize trial . In study , CO2 insufflation almost completely reduced procedure-related pain discomfort . In 2007 , could demonstrate advantage CO2-Insufflation DBE . Another group confirm finding . To knowledge , research perform investigate use CO2 SBE . BAE long-lasting procedure . Large volume air insufflated procedure , lead significant distension small bowel examination . One main technical difficulty BAE formation small bowel loop sharp angels deep intubation endoscope . These loop angel major restriction deep intubation endoscope . Loops sharp angel pronounce air-distended bowel segment . The aim present study examine whether CO2 insufflation lead reduction abdominal pain SBE patient . Furthermore , want investigate CO2 insufflation facility deeper intubation endoscope , show DBE technique . Hypothesis 1 . The use CO2 SBE lead reduction abdominal pain patient compare use air . 2 . The use CO2 SBE lead deep intubation compare air insufflation . The study design two-center randomized control trial . Randomization two group ( CO2 vs. air insufflation ) perform individual participant basis . Randomization two group ( CO2 v air insufflation ) perform basis individual participant . Equally large group randomize , use block randomization ( block six patient ) participate center . Randomization ( use SPSS statistical software package ) perform independent researcher , part SBE team . Individuals eligible inclusion patient refer SBE trial center fulfill one follow exclusion criterion : - Age 16 year - Inability understand information participation - Refusal participation All eligible individual inform nature study . All individual provide write informed consent enter trial . Patients wish participate present trial treat accord standard procedure ( use air insufflation ) . All procedure perform experienced endoscopists . Both patient endoscopists blind regard type gas use particular patient . Sedation perform accord current standard center . Single-balloon procedure SBE perform use SBE endoscope system ( SIF-Q180 , Olympus Optical , Tokyo , Japan ) , described literature 2-4 . Gas insufflation CO2 insufflate use EZEM equipment ( , specify ) . Air insufflate use ordinary air inlet system endoscope rack . The air inlet button hidden view endoscopist prevent unblinding ( technical detail specify cooperation company ) . For evaluation pain discomfort , questionnaire use classify patient pain procedure . Visual analogue scale ( 100-mm ) use quantify abdominal pain examination 1 , 3 , 6 , 24 hour procedure , validate recent studies7,8 . The questionnaire give every participant procedure , fill next day . All procedure parameter interest ( e.g . duration , depth insertion , use sedative ) register endoscopist immediately examination use exist GI lab database . Ethics The regional ethic committee participate center ask approval study protocol . Power analysis : 25 % improvement intubation depth consider clinically important detect . On basis DBE-CO2-study9 , power calculation conduct determine size study ( n=66 ) . Ownership data own respective center . Publication study result plan peer-reviewed journal . Philipp Lenz Dirk Domagk co-ordinate study design , data generation analysis first manuscript draft . Budget : All procedure present study perform ordinary patient , ordinary staff endoscopists . Therefore , extra cost occur personal .</detailed_description>
