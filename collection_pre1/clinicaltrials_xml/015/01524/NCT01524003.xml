	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop implement community base preventive healthcare model use cervical cancer screen target medical intervention . The investigator first conduct 2 pilot study refine preventive healthcare model base principle community base participatory research ( 1000 participant ) . The investigator apply model screen 9000 woman cervical cancer period 7-9 day . This 10,000 patient trial explore ability community conduct screen program identify need medical intervention base self-collection centralized high-throughput low cost human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening prevention program general , throughout world , suffer major cost constraint , poor participation , lose follow-up , concern sustainability . Over past 15 year investigator study self-collection way reach medically underserved cervical cancer screen . In recent 10,000 patient randomize clinical trial demonstrate self-collected sample equivalent accuracy physician obtain endocervical specimen do less expensively high throughput current propose accurate test modality . With majority world ' medically underserved living middle income country , longer necessary think small , slow , simple , poor quality control . It totally achievable self-collection centralize , high-throughput , low cost per case processing , reach million woman short period time . Again , concept need restrict medically underserved , clarity paradigm realistic solution critical develop world healthcare problem . In addition , solid medium specimen transport card , thereby avoid logistics deal personal use alcohol-based liquid , concern exposure temperature , ease transportation . Using PCR-based technology self-collection algorithm ability make test highly sensitive , help address another key issue manage positive . In investigator ' propose centralized model , since primary output test provide genotyping reasonable option tailor management positive would exist . Now need focus develop model enable efficiently place exist technology next woman need . Developing community base system remove identification abnormal medical model , markedly affect cost preventive healthcare . In addition community involvement design program , expect participation `` campaign '' follow-up significantly improve . Sustainability also become simpler problem `` campaign '' `` event '' type model ( possibly once/year , per every 5-10years ) . The investigator believe patient recruitment loss follow observe screening program conduct develop world , root ask large number patient , presently ill , symptomatic , travel long distance interrupt daily life . The investigator believe much effective program design community , use self-collection model ensure great recruitment participation , minimize loss follow . This project CHICAPS design develop community base screen model addition randomize treatment option explore technology suit rural environment</detailed_description>
