	<brief_title>Study Dovitinib ( TKI258 ) Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) uncommon malignancy arise secretory gland . The common site disease major minor salivary gland tumor may also arise nasal cavity , lacrimal gland , tracheobronchial tree , breast vulva . The mainstay treatment localize ACC surgical resection often follow post-operative radiotherapy . Although lead initially high rate local control , 5-year disease-free survival rate 50-75 % . In addition , significant proportion patient develop distant metastasis , frequently lung . Compared malignancy , ACC tend grow slowly . Thus , patient often well short-term long-term prognosis remain guarded succumb disease within 10-15 year . To date , systemic therapy prove largely ineffective recurrent metastatic ACC . Dovitinib broad-targeted-profiled RTK inhibitor active three RTKs ( VEGF , FGF PDGF ) involve tumor cell growth . Based potency inhibitor RTKs vitro vivo , compound 's oral availability , several clinical trial dovitinib underway . This phase II trial test hypothesis dovitinib active disease . The rationale base pre-clinical study suggest dovitinib suppresses tumor growth block constitutive signal fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( FGFR1 ) animal study drug prove active primary ACC xenograft .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible inclusion study meet follow criterion : 1 . Patients must histology cytology study confirm diagnosis adenoid cystic carcinoma . ( Note : Subsequent central review pathology slide provide Drs . Christopher Moskaluk Henry Frierson , Department Pathology University Virginia Health Sciences Center ) . 2 . Patients must recurrent and/or metastatic disease amenable potentially curative surgical resection radiotherapy . 3 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan ( &gt; 20 mm conventional technique ) . Pathologic lymph node measure short diameter per RECIST . 4 . Patients must serial imaging allows measurement tumor growth rate change point analysis : 1 . The remote baseline study scan must within six calendar month immediate prestudy scan . 2 . The remote baseline scan must measurable disease ≥ 10 mm nonpulmonary lesion ≥ 4 mm pulmonary metastasis show subsequent progression . 3 . Comparison remote baseline subsequent study must show progressive disease 15 select target lesion base follow : 1 . Modified RECIST criterion ( i.e . proportional increase 1.2 appearance new lesion ) AND/OR 2 . Progression change point analysis increase slope average tumor measurement least 0.22 b = `` remote baseline scan '' refers scan do prior prestudy scan use determine pretreatment tumor growth rate . b = estimate mean minus one standard deviation base analysis progressive tumor untreated patient ACC . 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 16 week . 6 . ECOG ( WHO ) performance status 02 7 . Age ≥ 18 year old 8 . Patients must follow laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9 g/dL Serum total bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 3 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 30 mL/min use CockroftGault equation , see formula : CrCl = [ 140age ( year ) ] x weight ( kg ) / [ 72 x serum Cr ( mg/dL ) ] ( patient female multiply 0.85 ) 9 . Patients give write informed consent obtain accord local guideline Patients ineligible study follow : 1 . Patients brain metastases 2 . Patients another primary malignancy within 3 year prior start study drug , exception adequately treat insitu carcinoma uterine cervix , skin cancer ( basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) 3 . Patients receive last administration anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy monoclonal antibody ( exclude nitrosurea , mitomycinC , target therapy radiation ) ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , recover side effect therapy 4 . Patients receive last administration nitrosurea mitomycinC ≤ 6 week prior start study drug , recover side effect therapy 5 . Patients receive targeted therapy ( e.g . sunitinib , sorafenib , pazopanib ) ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , recover side effect therapy 6 . Patients radiotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug ≤ 2 week prior start study drug case localize radiotherapy ( e.g . analgesic purpose lytic lesion risk fracture ) , measurable lesion outside radiation field . Also exclude would recover toxicity radiotherapy . 7 . Patients undergone major surgery ( e.g . intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) , open biopsy significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , patient minor procedure , percutaneous biopsy placement vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior start study drug , recover side effect procedure injury 8 . Patients follow concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition could compromise participation study : Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : History presence serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia Clinically significant rest bradycardia LVEF assess 2D echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) &lt; 45 % Any follow within 6 month prior start study drug : myocardial infarction ( MI ) , severe/unstable angina , Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) , Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) , Cerebrovascular Accident ( CVA ) , Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) Uncontrolled hypertension define SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg , without antihypertensive medication ( ) 1 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption dovitinib ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) 2 .

Patients currently receive anticoagulation treatment therapeutic dos warfarin 5 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g . active uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diabetes ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol 9 . Pregnant breastfeed woman 10 . Women childbearing potential employ effective method birth control . Two birth control method must use throughout trial one month last dose study drug ( e.g . condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Contraceptives affect cytochrome P450 interaction ( e.g . oral , implantable , injectable , intrauterine hormonal contraceptive ) consider effective study . Women childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) , must negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 day prior start study drug . 11 .
