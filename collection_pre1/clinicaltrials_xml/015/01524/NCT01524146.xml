	<brief_summary>Currently , center offer Photodynamic therapy unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma United States . Several European study report efficacy safety Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Cholangiocarcinoma , however , study report United States . The establishment registry capture PDT case within outside US help investigator evaluate large non-ambiguous sample population . This would help investigator evaluate technical success rate , clinical success rate , feasibility safety PDT unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . With endoscopists consider PDT therapeutic option along adjuvant treatment cholangiocarcinoma , need evaluate efficacy safety combine procedure well . The ultimate objective ass PDT without additional adjuvant treatment option prolongs survival duration improve quality life patient unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . This multicenter registry initiate : - To document impact PDT clinical management unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . - To assess clinical technical success rate PDT unresectable cholangiocarcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PDT offer number practical advantage ; minimally invasive low complication rate , procedure easily perform trained endoscopist , well tolerate . In trial conduct Germany , adverse event PDT mild moderate , predictable , relatively easy control . Photosensitivity systemic side effect ( see three patient ) . However , provide simple guideline light exposure follow , minimal risk patient , show low incidence photosensitivity reaction study resolve . A study Mayo group include 25 patient unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treat PDT 1991 2004 show time interval diagnosis treatment PDT important predictor survival follow PDT even adjust potential factor affect survival age , gender , Bismuth stage , presence tumor mass image presence extra biliary spread . Early treatment PDT may lead great preservation liver function . A recent study primary investigator also recently report improved survival patient receive PDT stent compare stent ( 16.2 month vs 7.4 month ) . Several European study report efficacy safety PDT cholangiocarcinoma ; however , study report United States . This due fact PDT offer therapeutic option unresectable cholangiocarcinoma within US . However , establishment registry capture PDT case within outside US help investigator evaluate large non ambiguous sample population . This would help investigator evaluate technical success rate , clinical success rate , feasibility safety PDT unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . The involvement international site crucial , advanced endoscopists world offer photodynamic therapy manage unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . However , non-existence registry , fact PDT offer center US ; case often report small sample size . The registry hop combine comparable case collect enough relevant data statistical analysis . With endoscopists consider PDT therapeutic option along adjuvant treatment cholangiocarcinoma , need evaluate efficacy safety combine procedure well . The ultimate objective ass PDT without additional adjuvant treatment option prolongs survival duration improve quality life patient unresectable cholangiocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
