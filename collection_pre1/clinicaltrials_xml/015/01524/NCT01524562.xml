	<brief_summary>Background : - Liver disease lead cause death people human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . It especially affect HIV hepatitis B C virus . Most research HIV-related liver disease conduct North America Europe . However , HIV-related liver disease Uganda African nation may involve disease common West , may involve hepatitis B C. Researchers want study HIV-related liver disease Uganda learn difference Western African trend disease . Objectives : - To study HIV-related liver disease rural Uganda . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age test possible liver disease . Some participant HIV infection ; others uninfected . - All participant rural area Uganda . Design : - Participants least two study visit . - Participants physical exam medical history . They complete questionnaire health quality life . Blood , urine , stool sample collect . Participants also liver scan check liver scarring , ultrasound take image liver . - Participants may liver disease visit local hospital test . A liver biopsy perform collect liver tissue sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With improved survival follow introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , liver disease become leading cause death among HIV-infected person Western cohort , primarily affect co-infected hepatitis B C virus ( HBV , HCV ) . However , data sparse liver disease HIV-infected population Uganda African nation , etiology liver disease broad include aflatoxin , schistosomiasis infectious environmental agent . Our previous noninvasive study rural , Rakai , Uganda indicate prevalence significant liver fibrosis high among HIV-infected individual ( 17 % ) 50 % high HIV-uninfected person , although prevalence viral hepatitis B co-infection low ( 5 % ) . The study present biopsy-based study follow result objective define etiology liver disease describe mechanisms HIV-accelerated liver fibrosis setting .</detailed_description>
