Despite clinical use Family Center , effectiveness FL never systematically evaluate use randomized design . This study systematically evaluate feasibility conduct randomized clinical trial FL versus standard mental health care Family Center child history neglect caregiver also history childhood neglect , without trauma . Caregivers define adult assumes primary responsibility child 's daily care home environment , may include biological parent , adoptive parent , grandparent , aunt/uncle , sibling reach age majority primary caretaker child client , etc . Evaluation method include standardized instrument EKG administer baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Study Objectives : Primary objective : To examine feasibility recruit conduct propose intervention evaluation procedure cohort child expose neglect caregiver use randomized design . Secondary objective : Examine effect FL heart rate variability , behavior , post traumatic stress disorder symptom , function . Tertiary objective : To examine difference treatment outcome ( trauma symptom , behavior problem , child functioning , parent behavior , etc . ) client receive FamilyLive client receive SMHC Family Center .</detailed_description>
