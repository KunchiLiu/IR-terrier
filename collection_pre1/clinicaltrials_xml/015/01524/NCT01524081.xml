	<brief_title>Antibiotic Prophylaxis Prevention Surgical Site Infections After Selected Urgent Abdominal Surgical Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Infection relate surgical procedure always consider main cause mortality end morbidity surgical patient . ATB prophylaxis become breakthrough surgical praxis term prevention surgical postoperative complication ( Surgical Site Infection - SSI ) radical improvement surgical result . ATB prophylaxis prior intervention procedure present however 1/3 cost medicinal product also potentially hazardous . Even single use antibiotic agent cause development nosocomial infection indispensable mortality costly treatment . Several recommendation worldwide literature present last 10 year concerned indication route administration antibiotic prior schedule acute surgical procedure ; indication acute procedure broaden increase consumption antibiotic . Excessive pre-hospital hospital exposure antibiotic however relate development microbial resistance show high incidence nosocomial infection ( health care - associate infection - HAI ) - urinary infection , pneumonia , catheter infection another diseases Clostridium colitis cause highly virulent type . Moreover study suggest bad compliance dose time antibiotic prophylaxis cause negative effect prophylaxis without positive affection SSI . This knowledge disagreement lead u elaboration protocol prospective randomize placebo control study could base correct surgical praxis investigator 's condition . Aim project The aim prospective randomize placebo control study prove positive effect antibiotic prophylaxis incidence SSI patient comparable risk develop nosocomial infection case acute abdominal procedure diagnosis appendicitis , ileus small bowel stomach small bowel perforation thus exclusion tertiary peritonitis . Secondary aim identify group patient risk develop nosocomial infection exceed benefit ATB prophylaxis . Tertiary aim ass whether preoperative microbial screen significance reduction HAI . After compare financial cost therapy ( include SSI HAI generally ) possible submit background proposal recommend procedure administration antibiotic prophylaxis common acute surgical procedure regard risk factor genesis nosocomial infection . Such prospective randomize placebo control study conduct Czech Republic ; study similar target group patient ( common surgical praxis ) publish world literature . Hypothesis Correctly administer antibiotic prophylaxis prior acute abdominal procedure reduce frequency SSI . It increase frequency severe nosocomial infection risk group patient . rational use antibiotic prophylaxis however lead reduction incidence nosocomial infection clinical socioeconomic impact include prevention fear severe infection associate health care ( HAI ) . Methodology Method aim : 1 . Assessing effect risk development nosocomial infection behalf patient ( ASA , morbidity , relevance actual disease , microbial screening target community infection , BMI , previous hospitalization health care facility ) . 2 . Assessing perioperative influence genesis nosocomial infection ( correct administration ATB prophylaxis- protocol control , perioperative influence - blood loss , body temperature , extend inflammation , SIRS sings , duration surgery , ICU stay , microbial profile , analgesia , physiotherapy , complication assessment ) . 3 . Assessing influence ATB correctly administer genesis SSI acute procedure ( length hospitalization , length treatment complication ) . 4 . Long term socioeconomic impact SSI ( 60 day follow , life quality assessment ) , standard proposal . After completion patient monitoring analysis cost hospitalization include medication , surgery postoperative outpatient control conduct use hospital information system . Appropriate patient enrol study patient follow diagnosis operate site : Acute appendicitis ( classical laparoscopy appendectomy ) , ileus small bowel ( adhesiolysis , enterotomy suction resection small bowel ) , perforate stomach duodenal ulcer ( classical excision ulcer suture GIT wall ) , i.e . patient without stercoral peritonitis . Patient definitely include sign preoperative inform consent form able understand well whose diagnosis confirm surgery . Patients exclude young 18 year age , pregnant female , patient know allergy administer ATB also mental state allow appropriate instruction signing informed consent patient use ATB course last 2 week . Preoperative care , actual surgical procedure subsequent postoperative care direct subject study conduct accord far know procedure . Patient administer therapeutic agent ( antibiotic ) placebo form intravenous infusion 60 minute prior surgical procedure due suspicion mention diagnosis . If surgery last 3 hour , infusion repeat . After analysis common pathogens individual clinical diagnosis , microbiologist chose following preparation : Acute appendicitis - Cefuroxim ( Zinacef 1.5 g ) + Ornidazol ( Avrazor 1g ) , perforate ulcer - Aminopenicillin + inhibitor ( Amoksiklav 2.4 g ) + Fluconazole 800mg i.v. , ileus small bowel - Cefuroxim ( Zinacef 1.5 g ) + Metronidazol ( Avrazor 1g ) . Surgeon confirm definite diagnosis surgery confirm definite inclusion study . Surgeon present dilution administration agent . Nobody patient 's attend study personnel able distinguish whether patient administer antibiotic saline solution . The prophylaxis extend 24 hour common half-dosage accord publication source . Randomization conduct use generator random number . This sequence incorporate simple digital patient database internet access password protect . One educate ICU nurse enter basic patients´ data system determine whether prepare placebo dilute antibiotic . Since moment information confidential software accessible entering monitor parameter . Dividing individual group conduct interim control six month interval final division completion study . Totally 2 major group 6 subgroup 3 subgroup accord individual diagnosis one 1 control group . If severe complication ( allergy reaction ) occur , principle investigator uncover blind use specific password ; system entry automatically mean exclusion patient study . Patients discharge hospital base criterion ( agreement patient , without sign severe infection ( SIRS ) , sufficient oral intake , sufficient analgesia oral analgesic , would treatable outpatient department ) ; patient treat outpatient case complication ; patient question phone case uncomplicated course ask fill life quality questionnaire ( SF36 ) day 30 60 . Demographic data include patient monitor data record special card transmit specifically create software processing . Investigators assume include total 500 patient 3 year . Time schedule : 1. year project : creation randomization program , personnel education , software creation , inclusion 130 patient appendicitis diagnosis , 18 patient ileus small bowel 35 patient perforation ulcerous disease . Data processing . Results evaluate end year . 2. year project : Inclusion 130 patient appendicitis diagnosis , 18 patient ileus small bowel 35 patient perforation ulcerous disease . Data analysis perform subgroup analysis partial result process present . 3. year project : Inclusion 90 patient appendicitis diagnosis , 14 patient ileus small bowel 30 patient perforation ulcerous disease . Follow termination . Definite data collection , analysis , result evaluation include financial analysis . Standard proposal . Presentation national international forum , publication . Principle investigator apply create protocol continuously control compliance include schedule , process interim data , evaluate data compliance literature prepare presentation publication process final result . 2nd co-worker guarantee microbiological part project ; 3rd 4th co-worker collect rather large amount data enter create system . 5th 6th co-worker control include appropriate patient study ( mean acute procedure ) , % include patient number suitable patient important criterion significance gather data . They also cooperate presentation data processing . 7th co-worker control correctness data collection . 5 specifically educate independent nurse attend patient ( 24 hour service ) prepare infusion patient accord acquire randomization data - placebo monitor group . Administrative worker select data information system patients´ file , file selects study card supervises correct completion . Means data collection Data collection conduct term preoperative examination : Demographic data ( age , diagnosis , co-morbidity express score - ASA , BMI , blood count , CRP ) , microbiology sample detection influence community pathogen , especially presence multiresistant pathogens - Clostridium difficile seek . In course surgery : evaluation perioperative finding , SSI risk 0-3 point ; contamination score I-IV , body temperature monitoring ( BT ) , blood loss ( include weigh screen ) , length surgery . In postoperative period record : number transfusion preparation , number day UPV , day ICU , oral intake , physiotherapy , invasive inlet ( peripheral venous catheter , permanent urinary catheter , nasogastric tube , drain ) quality analgesia ( Visual Analog Scale - VAS ) . On discharge : sample collection microbiological examination , record SSI incidence HAI define accord criterion National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) , completion assessment life quality questionnaire ( SF36 ) . After discharge : complication record till day 30 60 ( SSI HAI ) , life quality assessment . After completion patient monitoring analysis cost hospitalization include medication , surgery postoperative outpatient control conduct use hospital information system . Statistics : Morbidity range 15 20 % , investigator consider 10 % clinically significant reduction . Minimal extent collection 118 consider 5 % level significance single side test test power 70 % ; minimal extent collection portion nosocomial infection 6-10 % 234 case clinically significant decrease 5 % . Estimates number require detection clinical difference two day ( standard deviation estimate 2.6 appendicitis respectively 3.2 perforation 2.3 ileus small bowel ) lead value 36 , 47 25 people group . Total number set 250 people fulfills mention criterion range 175 , 50 25 subgroup sufficient . Group homogeneity compare base descriptive statistical method ; risk factor evaluate use regression analysis multivariant analysis . When compare basic factor p &lt; 0.05 consider clinically significant case give test power . Patient inform consent ( short version , complete version approve ethic committee enclose appendix ) : Study description : Each surgical procedure risk call postoperative infectious complication . One possibility prevent complication preventive administration antibiotic prior procedure - call antibiotic ( ATB ) prophylaxis . There clear evidence positive effect ATB prophylactic use acute surgical procedure . On hand introduction ATB prophylaxis complication . Aim study : Aim study recommendation whether give case administration ATB prophylaxis positive effect reduction incidence postoperative infectious complication whether benefit high risk relate ATB administration . Inclusion study conductance : Single inclusion base decision patient ( approximately 500 patient ) . Study participation offer patient operate due acute appendicitis , perforate stomach duodenal ulcer due ileus small bowel . Pregnant lactating female exclude study . After patient 's consent study participation intravenous preparation administer contains active substance ( antibiotic ) placebo ( saline solution ) . Both administered substance register preparation administer give purpose general praxis . The chance application either active preparation placebo 50:50 . Patient telephonically inquire concrete postoperative complication day 30 60 surgery . If suspicion complication , patient examine treat use standard procedure . He ask completion questionnaire life quality . Health risk : This study relate practically excessive risk . ATB placebo administration way influence surgical procedure postoperative care . Non-invasive sample collection cultivation ( urine collection , sputum collection -secretion respiratory tract mucosa , smear throat stool ) . Compensation bodily harm : If patient obliges study physician 's instruction her/his team health damage patient occur result administration preparation , study sponsor cover cost treatment damage cover patient 's health insurance . Patient 's declaration : I , undersign , agree participation study . I older 18 year age . I inform detail aim study , procedure expect . Study physician explain expect benefit possible health risk . I acknowledge conduct study investigation activity . Study randomize therefore I acknowledge possibility random assignment individual group differ therapy . I fully understand I opportunity ask additional question satisfactory answered . I inform study conduct physician disease medication I take last 28 day also medication I currently take . I declare I know I pregnant time inclusion study . I understand I discontinue withdraw participation study time without affect course treatment . My personal data keep full confidentiality study enrollment accord applicable law Czech Republic . Based give consent original medical information could access authorize acquire data sponsor representative , independent ethic committee international local competent authority ( The State Institute Drug Control Czech Republic ) . Confidentiality protection personal data guarantee case . There cost participation study concomitantly study enrollment relate financial reward . I understand name never present report study . ( date , name , signature ) Cooperation Working site co-worker participates postgraduate education ; co-worker recognize surgical expert therefore guarantee correct study conductance result application praxis ; cooperation confirm agreement . Discussion Investigator 's work site conduct internal retrospective study deal SSI patient appendicitis stomach ulcer perforation . 180-200 acute appendectomy perform every year SSI frequency 2.5 - 18.5 % accord contamination . Group patient stomach ulcer perforation evaluate similarly ( n=42 ) SSI 14.3 % , total morbidity 35 % mortality 11.9 % . All data correlate result world literature however possible retrospective assessment correct monitoring ATB prophylaxis ( 40 % compliance ) patient stratification reduce frequency complication . Information Working site designer performs hundred give operation presumption completion study aim . Especially young surgeon participate study manage methodology hospital care well surgery supervision experience physician educate patients´ monitoring . Statistical evaluation perform professional statistician . Principle investigator numerous experience clinical study she/she publish his/her result journal . Other specific equipment necessary study procedure . Conclusion Proposed prospective randomize double blind study provide clear result assess effect administration ATB prophylaxis incidence SSI HAI case common acutely performed surgical procedure . Risk factor analysis cost treatment aid determine group patient benefit prophylaxis vice versa . Expected result significance project Project result use background establish recommended procedure antibiotic prophylaxis administration surgery . Standardized protocol introduce patient monitor include monitorzation nosocomial infection apply general surgical praxis . Simple universal software create term study manage patient database thus enable rapid concurrent assessment health care quality . Respective reduction nosocomial infection frequency result significant economic benefit surgical praxis . With regard similar complex prospective study publish national international magazine , publication impact journal ; socioeconomic analysis publish especially national medical journal would easily accessible . Project aid prevention nosocomial infection ( HAI ) reduction genesis thus increase surgical care , shorten hospitalization impact whole society .</detailed_description>
