	<brief_summary>Asthma common chronic illness childhood . About 10 % child affect . Not surprisingly , acute asthma exacerbation one common reason visit pediatric emergency room ( ER ) . About 5.7 % pediatric emergency room visit due acute asthma exacerbation . Around 8 % get admit hospital . This constitute huge financial administrative burden health care system . Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) gold standard prophylactic therapy patient persistent asthma . In set acute asthma exacerbation systemic steroid give early course treatment help decrease rate admission return ER . However , anti-inflammatory action corticosteroid , effect cause , take 4 hour start work . This mediated genomic pathway transcription several inflammatory cytokine suppress . It also show corticosteroid cause vasoconstriction non-genomic pathway . The onset action quick 30-60 minute . It propose action mediate block extraneuronal uptake ( metabolism ) norepinephrine vascular smooth muscle cell , hence , make available re-use sympathetic neuronal cell . Our objective compare efficacy add repetitive sequential dos budesonide versus placebo ( normal saline ( NS ) ) β2-agonist ipratropium bromide ( IB ) combination ( standard treatment ) management acute asthma child ER .

	<detailed_description>Asthma common chronic disease childhood common cause admission child hospital . Children Saudi Arabia relatively high prevalence asthma compare many country reason clear . The prevalence increase past 20 years2 following , sometimes exceed , pattern note Western country one decade ago . As state earlier 5.7 % ER asthma visit asthma exacerbation 8 % child get admitted hospital . Corticosteroids ( CS ) show two different effect acute asthma patient : 1 . The classic anti-inflammatory genomic action implicate activation repression multiple gene involve inflammatory process . Thus , CS produce effect cell activate glucocorticoid receptor alter transcription direct DNA binding . In addition , ligand activate glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) bind pro-inflammatory transcription factor like NFkB ( Nuclear Factor kappa B ) activate protein-1 leading inactivation . Consequently , CS increase synthesis anti-inflammatory protein , inhibit synthesis many inflammatory protein activation suppression gene encode . Moreover , CS show block production several pro-inflammatory cytokine increase mRNA ( messenger ribonucleic acid ) degradation rate . These effect occur time lag 4-24 hour . So far recommended us CS asthma therapy relate mode action , include use systemic CS patient asthma exacerbation emergency room . 2 . The nongenomic action , rapid onset ( minute ) , reversible ( short duration 60-90 minute ) , dose dependent . A protective effect demonstrate 2 hour single dose 100 mcg fluticasone propionate inhaler use bronchial provocation cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . Higher dos report cause significant effect . Asthmatics present significant increase airway mucosal blood flow comparison healthy subject . Calculated volume conduct airway trachea terminal bronchiole , mean airway blood flow value 24-77 % high asthmatic healthy control . The inhalation fluticasone ( 880 mcg ) budesonide ( 400 mcg ) significantly decrease blood flow group , asthmatic . Evidence suggest CS decrease airway blood flow modulate sympathetic control vascular tone . CS inhibit extra-neuronal monoamine transporter- mediate uptake norepinephrine bronchial arterial smooth muscle cell , therefore , potentiate noradrenergic neurotransmission airway vasculature . This action possibly mediate bind CS membrane bound GR smooth muscle cell human airway blood vessel . This effect topical local one feature Inhaled CS ( ICS ) rather systemic CS ( SCS ) . Furthermore , decrease airway blood flow likely enhance action inhale bronchodilator diminish clearance airway . Thus , simultaneous administration ICS bronchodilator could clinical significance . Accordingly , ICS would administer simultaneously bronchodilator high repeat sequential dos way obtain maintain effect throughout time . Since ICS induce vasoconstriction peak 30 60 min drug administration , use interval 30 min seem adequate . A recent meta-analysis compare ICS SCS ; ICS SCS combination placebo SCS combination Emergency Room ( ER ) , include 17 different randomize double blind placebo control trial data 1,133 subject ( 470 adult 663 child ) available analysis . It conclude ICS present early beneficial effect ( within 1 2 h ) term clinical spirometric variable use 3 dos administered time interval ≤ 30 min 90 120 min . ICS lead significant reduction admission rate 2 4 hour 10 subject need treat prevent one admission . The nongenomic effect suggest possible candidate cover link molecular pathway clinical effect CS . However , issue remain controversial current asthma guideline publish National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) USA include use inhaled glucocorticoid treatment asthma ER , Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) guideline suggest effective . This subject clearly need study . The addition inhale anti-cholinergics ( Ipratropium Bromide ( IB ) ) β2-agonists treatment asthma ER show effective , especially severe asthma , consider standard therapy . However , limited data exist compare addition ICS anti-cholinergics β2-agonists combination adult . In one study use triple therapy superior combination β2-agonist either IB ICS . Up knowledge , issue previously investigate child . Moreover , protocol use adult may practical use child . Exhaled NO marker airway inflammation . Its level increase several condition chronic airway inflammation . It correlate well sputum eosinophilia bronchial hyper-reactivity none steroid treat subject . It useful adjunct asthma diagnosis , monitor asthma control , adherence ICS , predict asthma exacerbation . Its usefulness assessment severity asthma exacerbation response treatment emergency room determine yet . Few study show measurement Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) emergency room correlate asthma severity predict treatment outcome . It also correlate measurement like symptom score PEFR ( peak expiratory flow rate ) . However , study set propose . In word , use standard medication . Nevertheless , issue need study , especially evidence ligand bind cytoplasmic GR lead rapid activation NO synthase endothelial cell thereby may alter level FeNO . This study good opportunity examine value measure FeNO emergency especially measurement easy , reliable reproducible . The availability new portable , valid , reliable device measure FeNO ( NIOX Mino ) make even attractive . Up knowledge , design propose study . Our objective compare efficacy add repetitive sequential dos budesonide versus placebo ( normal saline ( NS ) ) β2-agonist ipratropium bromide ( IB ) combination ( standard treatment ) management acute asthma child ER . We hypothesize addition Budesonide β2-agonist IB management moderate severe acute asthma ER superior addition placebo .</detailed_description>
