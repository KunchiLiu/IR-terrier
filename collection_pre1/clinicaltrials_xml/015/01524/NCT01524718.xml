	<brief_summary>Hip fracture one frequent operate fracture procedure orthopedics , world wide annual incidence approximately 1.7 million . These fracture associate substantial morbidity mortality . As population age life expectancy increase worldwide , incidence fracture likely raise , expect triple next 50 year . The use fluoroscopy resultant exposure radiation , integral part surgical procedure aim reduce fixate fracture femur . The risk contract cancer significantly high orthopedic surgeon Hip surgery major slice total radiation dose . Optimal position control image intensifier device may result significant reduction radiation dose time substantial shortening procedure . The investigator hypothesis technique would substantially shorten procedure time reduce unnecessary radiation exposure patient medical staff . Furthermore , use technique investigator eliminate need fluoroscopy technician surgery , need alternate fluoroscopy view .</brief_summary>
