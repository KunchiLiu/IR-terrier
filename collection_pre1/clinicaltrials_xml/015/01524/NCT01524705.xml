	<brief_summary>Results recent study use standard long short act insulin therapy ( Basal - Bolus BBI ) type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) show benefit low risk heart attack , stroke , eye , nerve kidney problem . Some study also show long time start treatment sign benefit . This lead review current way normalize blood glucose control basal bolus insulin make blood glucose well . Improving blood sugar insulin therapy usually cause weight gain , high sugar level meal , low blood sugar . Early study suggest people take long-acting insulin metformin , few blood sugar extreme also take new type medicine call glucagon-like polypeptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) agonist name exenatide ( Byetta ) , instead meal-time insulin . This mean might better way treat Type 2 diabetes . Participants ask take part eight month study find middle-aged old people Type 2 diabetes add risk factor heart disease even blood sugar level . They start long-acting insulin , mealtime insulin , metformin , already medication . Their kidney function test must normal must allergic metformin . Then , 2 month run-in phase , must willing assign chance one two group . This mean 50/50 chance ( like flip coin ) either group . Half start new medicine know Byetta rather meal-time insulin half remain meal-time insulin next 6 month ( 26 week ) see group steady blood sugar . They ask use continuous blood sugar monitoring system call DexCom . A sensor insert skin area insulin inject . The DexCom check blood sugar 24 hour day night worn 7 day recording collect . In 7 day period , also ask wear Holter Telemetry monitor record heart beat rhythm compare blood sugar reading . They also use home glucose meter check glucose level 3 4 time day . The study take place 12 center United States enroll 120-130 people .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLuctuATion Reduction With inSULin Glp-1 Added togetheR ( FLAT-SUGAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent medical endpoint study employ conventional basal bolus insulin therapy ( BBI ) type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) disappointing , show either inconsistent effect treatment risk micro- macro-vascular event , long interval treatment initiation evidence clinical benefit . In fact , one trial suggest treat glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) low target may even lead harm . This raise possibility aggressive glucose lower approach lead harm overwhelms benefit T2DM . Potential explanation result include three closely related physiologic process : glycemic variability , weight gain hypoglycemia . Too much variability glucose , especially post-prandial hyperglycemia , pose dilemma achieve near-normal mean glucose HbA1C level without cause insulin-induced hypoglycemia and/or weight gain . All three process link worsen systemic inflammation oxidative stress , increase renal cardiovascular risk . Fortunately , new tool available allow u assess severity glycemic variability ( continuous glucose monitoring , CGM ) , investigate mechanism may lead cardiovascular risk ( e.g. , systemic inflammation oxidative stress , sensitive measure diabetic renal disease , Holter Telemetry monitor hypoglycemia-induced arrhythmia ) . In addition , preliminary study suggest replacement rapid-acting analogue ( RAA ) traditional BBI glucagon-like polypeptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) agonist , exenatide , may substantially reduce glycemic variability without strong tendency increase body weight hypoglycemia . This research trial , `` FLuctuATion reduction inSUlin Glp-1 Added togetheR ( FLAT-SUGAR ) '' , use new method optimize glycemic control limit unwanted adverse effect , definitive comparative effectiveness trial . This trial design address follow primary hypothesis : In middle age old individual T2DM additional risk factor cardiovascular disease , background therapy basal insulin ( insulin glargine ) metformin , addition GLP-1 analogue , exenatide , reduces glycemic variability addition rapid-acting-analogue ( RAA ) ( insulin aspart , insulin glulisine insulin lispro ) active treatment period 26 week . The primary outcome measure change coefficient variation continuous glucose reading , assess CGM . Importantly , FLAT-SUGAR plan , priori , assess glycemic variability use CGM . Secondary trial goal explore potential between-group difference complication may result glycemic variability , include hypoglycemia , systemic inflammation oxidant stress , diabetic renal disease , weight gain cardiac arrhythmia . If , expect , FLAT-SUGAR demonstrate CGM provide objective verification reduce glycemic variability T2DM new GLP-1 agonist-based regimen , main goal trial accomplish . If reduce variability associate low risk adverse event inflammation , albuminuria progression , weight gain , hypoglycemia , and/or cardiac arrhythmia , long term clinical comparative effectiveness trial power evaluate medical outcome justify . In order conduct FLAT-SUGAR , randomize , control , multicenter , open-label investigator-initiated trial , primary funding support Sanofi-Aventis US donation medication device several company . The Sponsor-Investigator University Washington , also Operation Center ( OC ) .The Data Center ( DC ) University Texas Houston School Public Health . There 12 clinical site diabetes CGM expertise screen enroll qualify participant approximately 8-10 week run-in period , ultimately randomize , follow 120 total participant active treatment period 26 week .</detailed_description>
