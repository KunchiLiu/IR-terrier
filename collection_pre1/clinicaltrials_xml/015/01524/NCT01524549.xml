	<brief_summary>Background : - The endothelium inner line blood vessel . The cell line help regulate blood flow immune system function . Problems endothelial cell contribute heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes . Certain gene part gene may relate problem endothelial function . Researchers want study healthy adult gene may affect endothelial function . More information gene may provide information genetic risk certain disease . Objectives : - To study healthy adult genetic marker relate endothelial cell problem . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 65 year age . - Current participant Environmental Polymorphisms Registry certain gene relate endothelial cell problem . Design : - Participants single study visit collect information sample . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants ultrasound artery arm give short-acting medication call nitroglycerin study blood flow blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According CDC , heart disease lead cause death men woman racial/ethnic group United States , include African Americans , Hispanics , white . About 610,000 people die cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) every year , account 1 every 4 death ( 41 ) . Because many know risk factor heart disease hereditary , understanding connection genetics , particularly heritable polymorphism , cardiovascular disease risk great importance . This cross-sectional , control study design investigate association two single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) - cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) epoxygenase gene CYP2J2 SNP , CYP2J2 7 , soluble epoxide hydrolase ( sEH ) gene EPHX2 SNP encode K55R variant - alter endothelial function human . Healthy adult , age 18-65 year , either carrier CYP2J2 7 EPHX2 K55R , wild type ( WT ) respect either SNP recruit total five genotype group . Potential participant identify Environmental Polymorphisms Registry , mail informational letter , contact phone and/or email , pre-screened eligibility . As participant recruit , demographic characteristic ( i.e. , age , gender , race/ethnicity ) compare group , , necessary , recruitment target achieve approximate match demographic characteristic across group . Pre-screened individual provide verbal consent refrain take certain need supplements/medications could alter endothelial function recreational drug ( marijuana , cocaine amphetamine ) prior study visit , mail informed consent form , medical history form , urine collection cup , pre-visit instruction . Participants attend single study visit take place NIEHS Clinical Research Unit . During visit , write informed consent obtain , final screening eligibility determination include medical history review , assessment vital sign , physical examination , carbon monoxide measurement , pregnancy test ( applicable ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . In eligible participant , lipid panel perform endothelial function assess non-invasively brachial artery ultrasound ( i.e. , flow-mediated dilation ) digital peripheral arterial tonometry . Blood urine ( first void ) sample collect biomarker analysis , conduct Zeldin laboratory NIEHS . The primary objective study determine whether individual homozygous heterozygous CYP2J2 7 EPHX2 K55R SNPs exhibit alter endothelial function compare individual WT SNP . As secondary objective , impact two SNPs inflammatory CYP epoxygenase pathway biomarkers examine .</detailed_description>
