	<brief_summary>Patients age 18-65 acute demyelinate optic neuritis treatment high dose corticosteroid already choose patient diagnose physician contact screening enrollment . Patients randomize receive equivalent dose either intravenous ( IV ) oral corticosteroid treatment . Optic nerve function assessment compare baseline , prior treatment , one six month post corticosteroid treatment . This allow comparison whether route medication play role effectiveness treatment high dose corticosteroid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optic Neuritis Recovery After Oral IV Corticosteroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blind , randomize comparison study 1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily three day 1250mg oral prednisone daily three day recovery optic nerve function acute demyelinate optic neuritis . We compare assessment baseline , prior corticosteroid treatment , assessments one six month post corticosteroid treatment . Patient Population We propose study patient acute demyelinate optic neuritis treatment high dose corticosteroid consider . This presentation either first presentation demyelinate event ( CIS ) patient previous diagnosis CIS MS must first presentation ON affect eye . Subjects recruit out-patients assess acute demyelinate optic neuritis neurology , ophthalmology , neuro-ophthalmology London Health Sciences Center St. Joseph 's Health Care Center London , Ontario . Subjects include first visit take place within 14 day symptom onset . Only subject physician identifies/diagnoses optic neuritis consider corticosteroid treatment contact potential screening enrollment . To ensure treatment chosen base clinical judgement physician diagnose ON , investigator contact potential subject decision use corticosteroid make patient 's treating physician . Primary Secondary Endpoints The primary measure P100 latency Visual Evoked Potential affect eye six month . Secondary measure include high contrast visual acuity contrast sensitivity one six month post corticosteroid treatment P100 latency one-month post corticosteroid treatment . Visual Evoked Potentials VEPs record Teca Synergy equipment ( Viasys Healthcare ) . To ensure consistency technique , technician perform three assessment ( day 0 , 30 180 ) patient . The subject 's skin clean electrode placement . The scalp electrode place relative bony landmark , per International Society Clinical Electrophysiology Vision ( ISCEV ) standard ( 40 ) . The electrode position 5 cm inion Oz ( active ) , mid-forehead Fz ( reference ) right arm ground , follow ISCEV guideline . The patient position comfortably chair eye distance 1 meter 17-inch cathode ray tube ( CRT ) monitor , find superior LCD monitor latter cause delay latency . The room darken minimize extraneous light produce response visual cortex interfere VEP response . The room use every VEP study . The subject monitor fixation poor fixation affect P100 peak time eye patch use isolate vision one eye . Monocular stimulation occur frequency 2 Hz , begin unaffected eye , average 200 individual response trial . A minimum two trial per eye perform per ISCEV guideline . Further average additional trial may do obvious technical problem ( visual fixation instance ) . As test dependent subject compliance , follow take place maximize compliance technical aspect record : talk gum chewing prohibit ; subject instruct relax muscle head neck specifically jaw ; foot rest flat floor hand relax subject 's lap ; coach take place help diminish anxiety ; importance fixation emphasize need resist follow change colour checkerboard pattern continue fixate red fixation square centre monitor explain . The interpretation VEPs do assessor blind treatment arm receive . Visual Acuity Visual acuity measure use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) chart standard protocol gold standard ophthalmology clinical trial use visual acuity outcome . Testing acuity occur initially 4 meter initially test 2 meter abnormality note 4 meter . Contrast Sensitivity Contrast sensitivity measure use Low Contrast Sloan Letter Charts find valid reliable MS population</detailed_description>
