	<brief_summary>The goal study determine value new mammography technique call Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) compare current standard technique Digital Mammography early detection Breast Cancer . DBT able compute three-dimensional image breast several low-dose mammography take different angle device move around breast circular motion . This overcome significant limitation Digital Mammography arise mask breast cancer mammography image cause overlie normal breast tissue . This study conduct several Austrian Breast Imaging Centers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Versus Digital Mammography : A National Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective national multicenter multivendor trial aim determine impact novel technique Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) assessment screen breast cancer . Mammography primary image modality early detection clinically occult breast cancer . Despite advance mammographic technique , mammography still limit regard sensitivity specificity . In majority case limitation arise mask subtle breast cancer lesion overlap breast tissue . DBT novel technique try overcome limitation perform 3D-reconstruction breast tissue multiple low-dose digital mammographic image acquire several plane 15 50 degree angle . Early study indicate advantage DBT compare standard Full Field Digital Mammography ( FFDM ) term improvement specificity without cutback sensitivity . Controversy continue use DBT combination FFDM standalone screen method without concomitant 2D imaging . Unfortunately , peer-reviewed publication evaluate DBT limited consist single institution study small number participant . The purpose study evaluate novel technique DBT compare routine FFDM clinical large sample study ( 600 participant ) provide path implementation new technique clinical screening routine .</detailed_description>
