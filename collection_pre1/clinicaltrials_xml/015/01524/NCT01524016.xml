	<brief_title>68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Oncogenic Osteomalacia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oncogenic osteomalacia , tumor-induced osteomalacia , rare , serious paraneoplastic syndrome . It predominantly drive small , benign mesenchymal tumor . The disease readily prompt clinical feature hyperphosphaturia , hypophosphatemia , low serum vitamin D3 level , elevate serum fibroblast growth factor 23 level , osteomalacia . However , causative tumor frequently hide unusual anatomical site often go undetected conventional imaging , compute tomography ( CT ) , permanent cure disease rely exact localization completely removal tumor . Since mesenchymal tumor express somatostatin receptor ( SSR ) , molecular image use radiolabeled somatostatin analog may one best way detect small , occult tumor . 111In- 99mTc-labeled octreotide analog prove useful detect mesenchymal tumor SSR-positive tumor . However , scintigraphy insufficient provide high-resolution image precise anatomical information . In study , novel approach propose exact localization mesenchymal tumor positron emission tomography ( PET ) image 68Ga-DOTATATE co-registration CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT novel method might improve sensitivity resolution specifically SSR-positive tumor , include causative tumor oncogenic osteomalacia . The investigator scan patient suspicion oncogenic osteomalacia confirm oncogenic osteomalacia patient suspicion relapse residual tumor surgery , compare 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT 18F-FDG PET/CT patient . The aim study see 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT detect tumor high resolution exact localization , help develop optimal treatment strategy improve patient care .</detailed_description>
