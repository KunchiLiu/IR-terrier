	<brief_summary>Background : Treatment HIV-1 infect Ugandan child antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) increase prospective long-term study evaluate treatment process report . In study seek determine prospectively consistent monitor HIV-1 RNA level impact ART treatment process . Methods : One hundred eight child initiate ART enrol study . These child comprehensive laboratory monitoring include HIV-1 RNA level determination genotype analysis ( appropriate ) , CD4 % plus absolute count , safety laboratory measurement perform prior start therapy regular interval receive ART . Kaplan-Meier statistic use examine predictor survival virologic failure . Viral genotype analysis perform sample obtain child virologic failure determent emergence mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Antiretroviral ( ARV ) Response Cohort African Children Using Viral Load Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Setting The study carry Paediatric Infectious Disease Clinic ( PIDC ) Baylor College Medicine Bristol Myers Squibb Children 's Clinical Centre Excellence Mulago Hospital . The PIDC HIV outpatient clinic operate 5 day week three paediatric clinic , one adolescent one family-based clinic . The clinic provide care one hundred eighty child HIV/AIDS daily . Approximately 50 child per month qualify antiretroviral therapy base upon clinical laboratory parameter . The Makerere University Faculty Medicine , Research Committee Ethics Committee , Uganda National Council Science Technology IRB board Baylor College Medicine University Wisconsin Hospital Clinics approve study . Informed consent assent ( applicable ) obtain primary caregiver and/or child enrollment . Study Participants Enrollment Starting 2007 child age 6 week 18 year confirm HIV infection receive ART consecutively enrol observational cohort study follow consent and/or assent ( applicable ) . Children exclude participation enrol another cohort study , psychosocial issue preclude participation ( parent guardian willing promote ART adherence clinic HIV counselor evaluation non adherence ) . The enrollment goal study approximately100 child recruit period 8 month . Initiation ART Study Design Children confirm HIV infect screened clinical history examination study physician determine eligibility . One hundred twenty two child recruit 111 enrolled prospective cohort study . Once enrolled decision start ART base upon guideline set forth WHO ( 2006 guideline addendum 2008 ) /UNAIDS recommendation , Ugandan National Policy ART laboratory parameter ( describe ) . ART treatment decision make discretion treat physician . Adherence monitor do mean self-reporting pill count patient visit clinic . Antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication use study include : zidovudine ( AZT ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) , abacavir ( ABC ) , stavudine ( d4T ) , nevirapine ( NVP ) , efavirenz ( EFV ) , didanosine ( ddI ) , tenofovir/emtricitabine ( Truvada ) , lopinavir/ritonavir ( Aluvia/Kaletra ) . History peripartum NVP use child and/or mother obtain interview . Clinical assessment disease staging ( WHO CDC ) baseline laboratory investigation include complete blood count ( CBC ) , renal liver function test ( RFT LFT , respectively ) , CD4 % /absolute count , HIV-1 RNA level genotype do prior patient start ART . All blood sample label study number use participant identification . Clinical assessment do every patient visit . VL monitor do every three month first year ART follow every 6 month thereafter end study period . CD4 % /absolute count safety laboratory evaluation do every 6 month . Genotype evaluation do prior start therapy virological failure document . Virologic failure define two consecutive ( clinic one month apart ) HIV-1 RNA level &gt; 400 copies/ml occur time study period child previously suppress 1-2 log10 response ART ; persistent viral load elevation ( &gt; 400 copies/ml ) first 3 month ART ; viral load &gt; 1000 copies/ml last blood drawn child end study period , death , withdrawal lose follow-up . Initial virologic response define decrease HIV-1 RNA level ( viral load ) least 1 log baseline 4-8 week ART . A full virologic response define HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 400 copies/ml ( undetectable ) week 24 and/or 48 start ART . Successful immunologic reconstitution define increase least 10 percentage point baseline CD4 percent level occur within first year therapy . An absolute CD4 cell count response ART define increase 50-150 cells/mm3 baseline level occur within first year therapy . A sustained decline 5 % CD4 % , decline pre-therapy CD4 % absolute count change baseline CD % /absolute count use define immunologic failure . Laboratory Measurements Complete blood count ( CBC ) , liver function ( ALT ) , renal function ( creatinine ) , CD4 percent/absolute count plasma HIV-1 RNA perform Makerere University-Johns Hopkins University ( MU-JHU ) core laboratory , Kampala , Uganda ( certify College American Pathologists ) . CD4 % / absolute count assess use BD FACS Calibur instrument ( Becton , Dickinson Company ) . The plasma HIV-1 RNA level measure use Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test Standard assay ( version 1.5 , Roche Company , Branchburg , NJ/USA ) . We report plasma HIV-1 RNA level log10 study . HIV-1 subtyping genotyping assess use GeneSeq technique Monogram Bioscience , South San Francisco CA/USA . In assay , amplify pool virus variant plasma sample use polymerase chain reaction ( adapt use non-subtype B virus ) product enable construct resistance vector DNA pool . Deduced amino acid sequence drug susceptibility sample virus compare reference virus strain identify mutation . Genotype analysis conduct blood sample &gt; 1000 copy virus particle per ml . The GeneSeq HIV assay detects minor virus population concentration 10-20 % . Statistical Analysis Survival virologic treatment failure analyse evaluate Kaplan-Meier statistic . Cox Regression multivariate analysis Kaplan-Meier statistic use examine relationship clinical laboratory parameter virologic failure t-test significance use evaluate immunologic ( mean CD4 % /absolute count different time point ) response ART .</detailed_description>
