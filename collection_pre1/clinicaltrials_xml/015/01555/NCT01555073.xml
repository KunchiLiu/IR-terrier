	<brief_summary>Uterine leiomyomata , also know fibroid , extremely common benign lesion present 30-50 % woman . Traditional surgical treatment symptomatic fibroid hysterectomy post child bear woman . However , last decade , use minimal invasive technique call uterine artery embolization become increasingly popular due high patient satisfaction , cost effectiveness , short recovery period . The purpose randomized blind placebo control study compare pre-emptive analgesia v non-preemptive analgesia immediate postoperative pain control , long term pain control , improve quality life woman follow uterine artery embolization surgery . The study consist four drug group include placebo group . The addition pregabalin celecoxib together epidural analgesia may improve pain management well lead well post-procedure outcome woman follow uterine artery embolization . Many investigator believe ischemia normal myometrium primary source pain immediately follow surgery make postoperative pain management challenging . Epidural fentanyl may offer advantage encounter visceral pain . In addition effective analgesic chronic pain syndrome , use pregabalin provide effective postoperative analgesia administer pre-emptively operation . Preemptive analgesia involve introduction analgesic regimen onset noxious stimulus , goal prevent sensitization nervous system subsequent stimulus could amplify pain . In human trial , pregabalin demonstrate reduce pain , improve sleep , mood disturbance patient post herpetic neuralgia . The use celecoxib combination pregabalin show provide effective analgesia provide antihyperalgesia . Therefore , addition pregabalin celecoxib together epidural analgesia may improve pain management well effect long term sequela .</brief_summary>
