	<brief_summary>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) treatment strategy use advanced line therapy different malignancy , mainly hematological . Its main advantage lie ability provide hematologic immune rescue high dose chemotherapy therapy . The first requirement successful transplantation recruitment sufficient amount cell . This achieve mobilize CD34+ stem cell bone marrow peripheral blood , G-CSF priming , harvest cell peripheral blood right timing mean apheresis . Currently , decision optimal collection time base pre-collection CD34 cell blood concentration . The investigator goal investigate whether telomerase , telomere elongation enzyme , constitutionally solely express progenitor cell , correlate collection post HCT engraftment characteristic . The investigator collect blood patient start GCSF day plan apheresis . Pearson correlation test use correlate telomerase activity sample collection engraftment characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) revolutionize curative approach number malignancy provide hematopoietic immune rescue high dose cytoreductive therapy . In case residual disease , patient usually treat chemotherapy repress disease , thereafter G-CSF injection give serially encourage stem cell proliferation bone marrow mobilization stem/progenitor cell peripheral blood . Another approach , usually utilizes myeloma patient administration G-CSF steady state ( without administration chemotherapy ) consequently collection CD34+ cell . The minimum number CD34+ cell threshold require HCT currently define 2 x 10^6/kg . However , optimal dose term engraftment may even high ( &gt; 5x10^6/kg ) , especially platelet recovery consider . In clinical practice , right timing collection decide upon measurement CD34 , membrane glycoprotein progenitor stem-cells . CD34 level measure expect maximal effect G-CSF priming , accordingly collection schedule . Practically , circulate CD34+cell count ≥20/μL , 90 % collection perform following day would expect yield ≥2.0x106 CD34+cells/kg ( Gordon , BMT 1997 ) . However , case higher dose CD34+ cell require ( e.g . tandem HCT ) , CD34+ threshold may sufficient determine collection yield . G-CSF base mobilization regimens 5-30 % failure rate amongst patient , however patient risk factor , 60 % patient fail mobilize . Poor mobilization significant consequence patient potential loss transplantation treatment option . Repeated attempt mobilization increase resource utilization , morbidity patient inconvenience . Therefore attempt identify patient would mobilize poorly clinical significance . Human telomerase , unique ribonucleoprotein complex , inactive normal somatic cell present high level 90 % malignancy . The enzyme , synthesize new telomeric repeat 3 ' end chromosome . As oppose normal cell , stem cell unique carry active telomerase provide long life span . Previous study lab show patient healthy donor , administration GCSF associate 14th fold increase telomerase activity level peripheral blood CD34+ cell . Working hypothesis : Telomerase activity mobilize stem cell correlate absolute number collect cell quality future engraftment high dose therapy HCT Specific aim : 1 . To investigate correlation telomerase activity CD34+ cell day collection total number collect CD34+ cell cohort 50 patient undergoing stem cell mobilization collection . 2 . To explore association telomerase activity CD34+ cell engraftment characteristic ( time platelet &gt; 50000/microL , time platelet &gt; 150000/microL , time neutrophil &gt; 500/microL , time neutrophil &gt; 2000/microL ) . 3 . To develop algorithm base CD34+ cell level CD34+ telomerase activity , measure day collection , serve predictor total number CD34+ cell collect .</detailed_description>
