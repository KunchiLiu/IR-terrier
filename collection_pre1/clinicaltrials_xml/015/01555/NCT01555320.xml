	<brief_summary>CACT-IHF aim evaluate clinical efficacy safety Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills treat ischemic heart failure . Meeting diagnosis , inclusion exclusion criterion , study plan recruit 640 case 35 upper class hospital China , divide two group ( treatment control group ) central randomization service . The treatment group administrate one bag Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills ( 0.52g/bag ) three time day addition standardize western medication . Whereas control group give one bag Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills dummy ( 0.52g/bag ) three time day addition standardize western medication . Efficacy indicator include primary indicator ( 6 minute walk test ) secondary indicator : composite endpoint consist all-cause death , emergency/re-admission hospital due HF , frequency re-admission due cardiovascular disease , acute coronary syndrome , severe arrhythmia , cardiac shock , revascularization , stroke , pulmonary embolism peripheral vascular incidence , etc . ; Brain Natriuretic Peptide ; echocardiography ; cardiothoracic ratio ; NYHA cardiac function classification ; Minnesota life quality scale ; score four traditional chinese medicine ( TCM ) diagnostic method ) . Other indicator include blood cholesterol , triglyceride , high density cholesterol low density cholesterol . Safety indicator include blood pressure , heart rate , blood urine routine test , liver renal function test , serum electrolyte , electrocardiogram adverse event . All patient receive interventional drug treatment 6 month . Follow need 1st , 3rd , 6th , 9th , 12th month recruitment . All patient follow end study ( Refers 12th month last case recruit study ) .</brief_summary>
