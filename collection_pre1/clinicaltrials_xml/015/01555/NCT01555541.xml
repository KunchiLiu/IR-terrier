	<brief_summary>The goal clinical trial show incorporate ofatumumab instead rituximab combination etoposide cytarabine ( OVA ) successful collect autologous stem cell use autologous stem cell transplantation ( autoSCT ) examine effectiveness eliminate residual diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Intensive Consolidation Stem Cell Mobilization Therapy Followed Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation High-risk Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients relapse Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) refractory relapse within 12 month first-line rituximab-based therapy , poor outcome conventional approach autologous stem cell transplantation detail . The investigator hypothesize intensive mobilization strategy develop overcome obstacle successful autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) eliminate residual disease follow salvage therapy facilitate stem cell collection . Even though clinical experience cooperative group set intensive pre-ASCT mobilization , never prospectively validated DLBCL concern exist ability improve outcome ASCT high-risk , heavily pretreated group patient . Furthermore , patient study site 's registry treat intensive mobilization rituximab-naïve finding may translate rituximab-refractory population . The investigator also believe ofatumumab , novel monoclonal antibody distinct CD20 epitope may fact overcome rituximab resistance DLBCL patient effective CDC may eliminate minimal residual disease patient contaminate tumor cell stem cell graft . General Design This single-institution , single-arm , prospective phase II study . Patients high-risk DLBCL ( define either achieve less complete remission ( CR ) initial rituximab-containing therapy relapse within 12 month initial therapy ) enrol study undergo stag prior receive intensive mobilization ofatumumab , etoposide , high-dose ara-C ( OVA ) . Following successful stem cell collection , patient proceed standard autologous transplantation cyclophosphamide , BCNU , etoposide ( CBV ) preparative regimen . Response evaluation occur salvage therapy , follow intensive mobilization therapy ( d42 ) , day +90 ASCT , 6 , 12 24 month thereafter . Event-free , progression-free , overall survival also assess 48 month . The primary study endpoint mobilization-adjusted complete metabolic response rate ( maCR ) follow OVA . Subjects chemosensitive salvage therapy ( i.e . achieve PR CR ) re-evaluated additional salvage regimen . If still chemosensitive point , withdrawn study replace .</detailed_description>
