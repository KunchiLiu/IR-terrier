	<brief_title>Akershus Cardiac Examination ( ACE ) 1950 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The overall aim Akershus Cardiac Examination ( ACE ) 1950 Study establish extensive cardiovascular age cohort elderly subject various longitudinal long-term follow-up study cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cerebrovascular disease ( CeVD ) , focus towards atrial fibrillation , heart failure , stroke cognitive function . Design : The Akershus Cardiac Examination ( ACE ) 1950 Study population-based , prospective , cerebro- cardiovascular age-cohort study men woman born 1950 Akershus County , Norway . A comprehensive baseline examination , include advanced ultrasound image biobanking , perform 4,000+ men woman born 1950 . Methods : Subjects either gender reside permanently Akershus County born year 1950 ( approximately 6000 resident eligible age ) invite participate study . At baseline visit ACE 1950 Study , participant subject ; ( 1 ) structure clinical examination interview , ( 2 ) advance imaging ( echocardiography , carotid intracranial artery ultrasound ) , ( 3 ) blood sample establish state-of-the-art biobank genetic , serum plasma sample ( storage -80Â°C ) , well immediate clinical chemistry analysis extend hematogram , electrolytes , creatinine , liver enzymes , thyroid hormone , lipid , fast blood glucose glycated haemoglobin , ( 4 ) key clinical variable weight , height , hip- waist circumference blood pressure ( measure sit supine position x 3 , 10 minute rest ) , ( 5 ) 12-lead digital ECG supine position 10 minute rest ( 10-second recording 25 mm/s 10 mm/mV ) , ( 6 ) cognitive function assessment Ten-word test ( CERAD ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MOCA ) Trail-Making Test A + B . ( 7 ) pulmonary function test standard spirometry , ( 8 ) study-specific ACE 1950 questionnaire , well validated questionnaire Short-Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , Hospital Anxiety Scale ( HADS ) Personality Type D Scale 14 ( DS-14 ) . Time schedule : A comprehensive planning process , include preparation protocol application , take place 2011 . After ethical approval , study inclusion baseline examination start September 2012 . Inclusion ongoing , anticipate last 2015 . Study administration : The ACE 1950 Study collaborative project two leading research group Baerum Hospital , Vestre Viken Hospital Trust Akershus University Hospital . The study direct steer committee . Each site establish study team include one study director site , investigator ( MDs , PhD student ) , study nurse echo technician . All study personnel go joint training towards standard study procedure . Internal monitoring well test inter-observer variability site perform regularly , ensure equal standard . An Events Endpoints Committee set . Current status : As per July 2014 , &gt; 1,900 subject recruit go baseline examination . The response rate anticipate approximately 65-70 % among study population . Completion baseline examination , expect approximately 4,000 subject , expect end 2015 . Scientific significance : The ACE 1950 Study generate new relevant insight novel approach identification sub-clinical CVD/CeVD . Early identification disease marker ultimately allow improved disease prevention .</detailed_description>
