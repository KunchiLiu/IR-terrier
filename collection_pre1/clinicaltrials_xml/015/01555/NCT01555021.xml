Doing could improve likelihood full reduction symptom . Today , many treatment option MDD . Individuals spend month year treatment receive one work treatment-resistant depression . The investigator want study treatment resistant depression examine specific gene ( genotyping ) might influence body respond certain antidepressant medication . This process examine specific gene experimental . To look specific gene , investigator collect saliva sample . Genes contain material pass parent child determine make-up body mind . For example , gene control color hair eye . Genes contain DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . There many difference DNA , one person another . These difference may affect person 's chance particular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 6-month , randomize , control study assay-guided treatment ( AGT ) versus treatment usual ( TAU ) adult inpatient major depressive disorder . Two hundred subject randomize receive AGT TAU . After subject screen , determine eligible , complete baseline assessment , saliva sample assay obtain subject . However , subject randomize AGT arm saliva sample immediately analyze . Subjects TAU arm saliva sample store future GWAS analysis . Once saliva sample obtain , attend psychiatrist ask indicate top three choice antidepressants dose initiate treatment . In order prevent delay provide treatment , first choice antidepressant start prior receive assay result . Upon receive assay report ( AGT arm ) , attend psychiatrist ask whether report influence choice antidepressant treatment dose antidepressant , well confidence choice . The attend psychiatrist document switch antidepressant treatment change dos current antidepressant medication structure form . The assay report available 3 5 day saliva sample take . The attend psychiatrist randomize provided result CYP genotyping also provide phone number consultation Genomind Labs regard interpretation result . Trough antidepressant blood sample AGT arm ( 10-12 hour last dose ) therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) obtain within 24 hour discharge . Blood sample also obtain TAU arm , store future analysis CYP genotyping biomarker analysis treatment resistant MDD . Clinical follow-up proceed felt clinically indicate . For subject discharge assay result receive , attend psychiatrist complete indicating change treatment patient still hospital . Results recommendation forward identified outpatient psychiatrist . The AGT arm standard care patient depression . The addition assay-results questionnaire make AGT arm different standard care . Only questionnaire make TAU arm different standard care . Note : Within 24 hour admit Inpatient Psychiatric Unit , `` baseline '' assessment occur . If stay Inpatient Psychiatric Unit one week , `` weekly '' assessment occur every 7 day . Typically , patient spend average 8-10 day Inpatient Psychiatric Unit . The day day discharge Inpatient Psychiatric Unit , `` discharge '' assessment occur . One , 3 , 6 month discharge , ask complete follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
