	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Calcium Preventing Metabolic Syndrome Patients With Prostate Cancer Receiving Long-Term Androgen-Deprivation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pilot study preliminary estimate overall change metabolic syndrome score men undergo undergone androgen-deprivation therapy treatment control prostate cancer . II . To assess effectiveness Atorvastatin ( atorvastatin calcium ) prevention metabolic syndrome men undergo undergone androgen-deprivation therapy treatment control prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document safety tolerability Atorvastatin patient population . II . To assess impact Atorvastatin mean change prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) PSA velocity . III . The collection banking blood serum subject future analysis propose future institutional review board ( IRB ) submission . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive placebo orally daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive atorvastatin calcium orally daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
