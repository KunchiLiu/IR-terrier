	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) efficacy augmentation agent treatment treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . The investigator predict NAC reduce OCD symptom sixteen week add-on treatment measure Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OCD debilitate psychiatric condition lifetime prevalence 2-3 % . It characterize recurrent , intrusive thought ( obsession ) and/or repetitive , stereotyped behavior ( compulsion ) last least one hour per day significantly interfere individual 's normal level functioning . Although cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacotherapy serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) effective treatment many patient , subset experience minimal relief symptom standard treatment . When severe , OCD completely incapacitate devastate consequence patient family . Augmentation strategies antipsychotic medication improve effectiveness SRI therapy eliminate OCD symptom ( Saxena et al. , 1996 ; McDougle et al. , 1995 ) associate adverse effect use chronically ; consequently , improved pharmacological treatment need . The clinical observation patient experience complete response SRI 's dopamine antagonists suggest neurochemical system involve pathophysiology OCD . The pathophysiologic hypothesis underlie proposal well-described hyperactivity cortico-striato-thalamic track OCD reflect glutamatergic hyperactivity address partially OCD patient serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment . It think NAC modulates brain glutamate stimulate cysteine-glutamate antiporter locate glia , increase extrasynaptic glutamate level thereby stimulate feedback inhibition synaptic glutamate release ( Baker et al. , 2003 ) . In addition attenuate synaptic glutamate release feedback inhibition , NAC also think enhance clearance glutamate synapse via neuroprotective growth factor promote effect glial cell . Its glutamatergic antagonistic property may effective reduce glutamatergic hyperactivity think contribute pathophysiology OCD . The propose study base recent preclinical neuroimaging study implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity pathogenesis OCD ( Carlsson et al. , 2000 ) . Neuroimaging study consistently identify increase blood flow , metabolism brain activity orbitofrontal cortex , striatum , thalamus individual OCD ( Baxter et al. , 1987 , 1988 , 1992 ; Swedo et al. , 1989 ; Sawle et al. , 1991 ; Rubin et al. , 1992 , 1995 ; Adams et al. , 1993 ; Perani et al. , 1995 ; McGuire et al. , 1994 ; Breiter et al. , 1996 ; Rausch et al. , 1996 ) . Within brain area , glutamate GABA driven pathway think responsible balance neural tone . The direct ( glutamatergic ) pathway think modulate initiation sustainability behavioral routine , indirect ( GABAergic ) pathway modulate cessation behavior . The lead explanatory model OCD suggest activity direct pathway relative indirect pathway result disinhibited thalamus creation self-perpetuating circuit thalamus orbital cortex drive OCD symptom ( Baxter 1992 , Baxter et al. , 1996 ) . Clinical study support model . Compared control , treatment na√Øve OCD patient significantly increase glutamatergic activity measure proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) ( Rosenberg et al. , 2000 ; Bolton et al. , 2001 ) . Moreover , treatment SRI associate significant decline caudate glutamate concentration individual respond SRI treatment ( Rosenberg et al. , 2000 ; Bolton et al. , 2001 ) . These clinical finding consistent pharmacological study demonstrate SRI-induced inhibition glutamate release ( Maura et al , 1988 ; Zhang et al. , 1997 ) . The investigator propose double-blind , placebo control study evaluate tolerability efficacy N-Acetylcysteine augmentation SRI therapy resistant OCD . Four recent report suggest riluzole , antiglutamatergic agent , possess anti-depressant , anti-obsessional , anti-anxiety property ( Coric et al. , 2003 , 2005 ; Zarate et al. , 2004 ; Sanacora et al. , 2004 ) . The rationale explore efficacy NAC treatment resistant OCD stem preliminary finding open label Riluzole study represent effort explore novel strategy modulate brain glutamate OCD .</detailed_description>
