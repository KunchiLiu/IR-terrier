	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose trebananib give together without low-dose cytarabine treat patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Trebananib may stop growth AML blocking blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving trebananib together cytarabine may effective treatment patient AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trebananib With Without Low-Dose Cytarabine Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile AMG 386 ( trebananib ) administer alone combination low-dose cytarabine adult patient : untreated AML consider ineligible standard induction chemotherapy ; refractory and/or relapse AML follow least one cycle prior therapy currently eligible stem cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical response AML patient follow AMG 386 therapy alone combination low-dose cytarabine therapy . II . To characterize biological change occur AML patient treat AMG 386 alone combination low-dose cytarabine , specifically : alteration angiopoietin ( Ang ) 1 , Ang2 , Tie2 , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) expression ; change bone marrow vascularization hypoxia ; change gene and/or micro ribonucleic acid ( microRNA ) expression ; PK/PD model characterize time course AMG 386 concentration relation target inhibition hematological response . III . To determine whether biological change correlate and/or predict clinical response AML patient treat study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study trebananib . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . ARM B : Patients receive trebananib Arm A . Patients also receive cytarabine subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 course 1 day 1-7 subsequent course . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 days* 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Course 1 35 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
