	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect , maximum tolerate dose , effectiveness paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( nab-paclitaxel ) treat patient recurrent refractory Hodgkin B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . More effective well tolerate therapy need treat patient relapse refractory lymphoma . Nab-paclitaxel combine chemotherapeutic agent protein may increase anticancer drug concentration tumor reduce toxic effect normal tissue may effective treatment lymphoma .</brief_summary>
