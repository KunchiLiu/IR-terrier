	<brief_summary>Quadriceps muscle weakness common consequence ACL injury . This muscle weakness consider result neural inhibition prevent full muscle contraction refer arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) . AMI hinders rehabilitation prevent gain strength , increase risk re-injury , potentially place patient risk chronic degenerative joint condition . Quadriceps weakness occur follow ACL injury also think cause muscle atrophy think manifest due alteration muscle architecture , selective fiber atrophy even neural deficit AMI . Importantly , intervention design counter muscle weakness require order promote long-term knee joint health . Hence , purpose current study determine efficacy intervention target quadriceps weakness improve quadriceps muscle function biomechanics patient prior follow ACL reconstruction . Specifically , efficacy neuromuscular electrical stimulation aim improve quadriceps neural activity eccentric exercise intend minimize quadriceps muscle atrophy investigate . The investigator expect patient receive electrical stimulation therapy demonstrate improvement quadriceps strength activation . Furthermore , expect patient receive electrical stimulation eccentric intervention demonstrate markedly great gain quadriceps strength activation patient receive electrical stimulation therapy standard care post-surgery . The investigator also hypothesize patient receive electrical stimulation therapy and/or eccentric display knee motion similar uninjured control subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Eccentric Exercise Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) show reduce quadriceps activation failure ( QAF ) eccentric exercise show lessen muscle atrophy post-ACL reconstruction . Given thatthese two critical component quadriceps strength , intervention combine therapy may effective reinstituting quadriceps function post-reconstruction . Therefore , aim study evaluate effectiveness combine NMES eccentric exercise intervention improve recovery quadriceps activation strength post-reconstruction . Patients post ACL-injury place four treatment group ( NMES eccentric ; eccentric ; NMES , standard care ) Patients assign NMES eccentric NMES group receive NMES protocol 2× per week first 6 week post-reconstruction . MES eccentric eccentric group receive eccentric exercise protocol 2× perweek begin 6 week post-reconstruction . Quadriceps activation assess via superimpose burst technique quantify via central activation ratio.Quadriceps strength assess via maximal voluntary isomeric contraction ( Nm/kg ) . Data gather three occasion : pre-operative , 12-weeks-post-surgery return-to-play .</detailed_description>
