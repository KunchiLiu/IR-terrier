	<brief_summary>The aim study assess effect ingest commercial carbohydrate protein dietary supplement powder form ( P-CHO supplement ) milk shake skim milk , strawberry banana ( MS ) , resistance exercise , muscle damage , oxidative stress , inflammation functional recovery . It hypothesise ingestion milk shake skim milk fruit ( strawberry banana ) impact marker muscle damage , oxidative stress , inflammation functional recovery induce resistance exercise , intake commercial powder CHO protein amount . Fifteen adult athlete Portuguese Athletic Federation complete 2 trial separate least 2 week . Alternate legs drink use trial participant overnight-fasted . This study single-blind , randomize , crossover , repeated-measures experimental design . In trial , warm-up , eccentric peak torque knee joint extensor determine use isokinetic dynamometer . After , participant complete isokinetic exercise exhaustion constant angular velocity 60° • s-1 . After exhaustion protocol , athletes perform peak torque determination . Immediately , participant drink P-CHO supplement MS first 2 h. Both drink contain 0.8-1.2 g carbohydrate • kg-1 • h-1 0.2-0.4 g protein • kg-1 • h-1 . Twenty four 48 h exhaustion protocol participant return laboratory repeat peak torque determination . Blood sample collect warming-up , immediately 2 h last peak torque determination 24 h 48 h . Serum sample analyze creatine kinase , lactate dehydrogenase , interleukine-6 , protein carbonyl total antioxidant status . The delayed onset muscle soreness , use visual analogue scale , girth measure moment blood sample . Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA use statistical analysis data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compared Effect Fruit Milk Shake With Protein-Carbohydrate Supplement Recovery After Resistance Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample : Fifteen adult athlete Portuguese Athletic Federation invite participate study . They must healthy lactose tolerant . Athletes voluntary receive explanatory document aim study . They must also sign informed consent participate . To help ensure metabolic condition similar trial , subject instruct fulfill food record physical activity record 2 day prior trial ( Shirreffs , Watson , &amp; Maughan , 2007 ) . It ask make drastic change diet avoid strenuous exercise period . Experimental Protocol : This study single-blind , randomize , crossover , repeated-measures experimental design . As show Figure 1 , participant complete 2 trial , wash period , least , 2 week . In one trial subject randomly drink P-CHO supplement , MS . In order minimize repeat bout effect , different leg use trial ( Howatson et al. , 2010 ) . About one week exercise protocol , participant familiarize experimental procedure measurement . At time , anthropometric assessment ( BW , height body fat percentage ) also take . All test perform morning , fast state . At begin trial , participant warm-up 5 min use cycle ergometer intensity 70-100 rpm . After warm-up , eccentric peak torque knee joint extensor muscle determine isokinetic dynamometry ( Biodex® , system IV ) . Then , participant complete concentric/eccentric knee extension/flexion exercise protocol exhaustion . After exhaustion , eccentric peak torque determination repeat . Immediately finishing isokinetic test , participant drink P-CHO supplement MS first 2 hour post-exercise . The drink take 2 bolus per hour , 2 h. During 2 day exhaustion protocol ( 24 h 48 h ) , participant return laboratory repeat eccentric peak torque determination similar warm-up day . Drinks ' Composition : The nutritional formula drink equal term CHO protein content order achieve recommendation value 0.8-1.2 g CHO • kg-1 BW • h-1 0.2-0.4 g protein • kg-1 BW • h-1 ( Beelen et al 2010 ) . They also similar amount vitamin C. The fruit content MS 100 g strawberry amount banana necessary guaranty 0.8-1.2 g CHO • kg-1 BW • h-1 . Regarding P-CHO supplement , available common local market meet recommend amount CHO protein recovery period . If necessary , vitamin C add match MS content . Exhaustion Protocol : For induct exhaustion , concentric/eccentric knee extension/flexion exercise exhaustion use . At first day trial , exhaustion protocol conduct . Securely fastened test chair isokinetic dynamometer knee joint test limb align axis rotation dynamometer distal lower limb secure dynamometer 's test arm , subject initially complete 3 maximal repetition knee joint extension flexion constant angular velocity 60°•s-1 determine subject 's maximal peak torque knee extensor muscle ( best 3 repetition ) . After , exhaustion protocol conduct . The protocol consist 3 bout concentric/eccentric knee extension/flexion exercise , 60°•s-1 , 200-second rest time set . The first second set compose 100 repetition ; third set , subject perform n repetition eccentric peak value 3 consecutive repetition fell 25 % initial knee extensor eccentric peak torque value . The range motion 50° 110° flexion knee ( 0º = full knee extension ) . Participants receive verbal encouragement perform maximally throughout exercise protocol . Functional Recovery : To monitor force recovery , measure eccentric peak torque knee joint extensor muscle determine . Athletes perform isokinetic strength test immediately exhaustion protocol 24 48 h exhaustion protocol , trial . The exercise consist 3 maximal repetition determine eccentric knee joint extension peak torque constant angular velocity 60°•s-1 . The range motion similar one use exhaustion protocol . Blood Sampling Biomarkers : For trial , blood take antecubital vein participant arrive laboratory , fast state . Blood sample also collect immediately last peak torque determination 2 , 24 48 h . The following blood marker use : - Muscle damage : CK LDH ; - Inflammation : IL-6 ; - Oxidative stress : protein carbonyl TAS . Other Measurements : The DOMS circumferential measurement measure moment blood sampling . A visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , 10 cm length , use determine DOMS ( Bijur , Silver , &amp; Gallagher , 2001 ) . The mid-thigh girth measurement do accord anthropometric technique suggest International Society Advancement Kinanthropometry ( ISAK ) . Three girth measure : 5 , 15 25 cm superior border patella . These measurement allow monitor oedema cause inflammation . Body Composition : Weight height measure accord methodology propose International Society ISAK . It calculate body mass index ( BMI ) percentage body fat measure four skinfolds ( biceps , triceps , subscapular suprailiac ) accord technique propose ISAK . The value measurement convert body density use formula : Durnin Womersley 1974 ( Costa , 2001 ) . Later , body density value convert percentage body mass , use formula Siri ( Costa , 2001 ) . Dietary Intake : Athletes ask carry food record 2 day prior trial . Each individual inform orally write , expert nutritionist , correct completion . It also require register time place food consumption make . Subsequently , data process computer program ( Food Processor® ) convert information energy nutrient calculate mean intake . Physical Activity : Two day prior trial , athletes record type , intensity duration physical activity registration document distribute previously . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS 18 Windows TM® ) . The result express mean ± standard deviation consider statistically significant p &lt; 0.05 . Normality assess Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Data analyze two-way repeated-measures ANOVA ( treatment [ two level : MS P-CHO supplement ] v time [ five level ] ) determine whether statistically significant effect time treatment ( Bowtell , Sumners , Dyer , Fox , &amp; Mileva , 2011 ) . The Mauchly sphericity test use check homogeneity covariance ANOVA analyse ; violation assumption sphericity correct use Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment . Where appropriate , effect size ( ƞ2 ) also calculate .</detailed_description>
