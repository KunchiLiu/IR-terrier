	<brief_summary>Background It commonly believe heart attack cause rupture plaque wall coronary artery , result blood clot impede blood flow . Currently , investigator know whether heart attack patient recent surgery cause disease process surgery . This study inform investigator vital information cause surgery-related heart attack take image coronary artery use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) . Images also take heart attack patient recent surgery , two group compare . OCT image OCT relatively new image technology much well take image inside artery . OCT imaging procedure carry time schedule coronary angiogram , catheter mini-camera tip advance coronary artery , record video image length artery . These image take approximately 3-4 second obtain . Besides OCT image perform , rest angiogram procedure carry exactly way would normally proceed . The OCT study provide doctor new information cause surgery-related heart attack , guide doctor treat prevent heart attack patient undergo surgery . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize feature acute plaque rupture common patient non-surgery related heart attack compare occur follow surgery . Design Two group patient recruit ( &gt; 20 group ) : 1. non-surgery related heart attack patient 2. patient suffer heart attack follow operation . Outcome measure Using OCT , plaque feature coronary artery patient heart attack surgical non-surgical group time coronary angiogram compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Coronary Plaque Rupture Heart Attack Following Surgery Using Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority spontaneous non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) attribute rupture unstable atherosclerotic plaque epicardial coronary artery thrombus formation . On hand , pathophysiology underlie myocardial infarction follow non-cardiac surgery well understood . The literature suggest significant proportion myocardial infarction follow surgery may result decreased myocardial perfusion presence stable coronary artery disease without plaque rupture thrombus formation . Intra-coronary Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) provide superior visualisation vascular lumen structure close arterial lumen compare IVUS , include feature plaque instability , include atherosclerotic plaque content , fibrous cap thickness , thin cap fibroatheromas ( TCFA ) , macrophage infiltration calcium ( 2-10 ) . OCT therefore ideal image technique examine pathophysiology involve POMI , feature plaque rupture thrombus formation clearly distinguish stable plaque . An improved understanding pathophysiology MI follow non-cardiac surgery guide management appropriately . Primary objective 1 . To identify feature acute plaque rupture peri-operative myocardial infarction ( POMI ) 2 . To compare frequency acute plaque rupture image finding POMI non-operative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize feature acute plaque rupture common patient non-operative NSTEMI compare POMI . Outcome measure 1 . OCT feature coronary plaque rupture obtain time coronary angiography , feature include thin cap fibroatheroma , intramural thrombus plaque fissuring . OCT data NSTEMI POMI patient group compare . Data plaque feature , include fibrous cap thickness , lipid core , minimum luminal cross-sectional area ( CSA ) , rupture cavity CSA also collect , compare two patient group . There clinical follow-up study .</detailed_description>
