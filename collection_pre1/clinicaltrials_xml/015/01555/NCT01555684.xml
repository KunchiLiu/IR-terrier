	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) often result reduce muscle function produce fatigue , weakness decline daily mobility . Although underlying cause disease unknown possible contributory mechanism chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ( CCSVI ) . Post-mortem study magnetic resonance venography show strong relationship cerebral venous system MS cortical plaque . From role CCSVI MS suggest : venous malformation result venous hypertension , pressure blood brain barrier subsequent inflammation due leakage haemosiderin parenchyma . This provoke immune response result neurodegeneration . A procedure know percutaneous venoplasty whereupon balloon insert inflated jugular vein develop improve drainage CNS , reduce venous hypertension improve symptom associate MS . Although procedure widely practice throughout world yet fully accept need support evidence base clinical trial . As NHS National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) recently issue consultation document determine procedure 's clinical safety efficacy . A common concern raise ability prevent possible placebo effect like clinical trial offer sham procedure match control group . The difficulty option ethical issue associate invasive sham treatment also practical issue mask potentially painful treatment venoplasty . One option blind neurological assessment patient either treat venoplasty active treatment . Another option use dependent measure unaffected motivational psychological influence avoids placebo effect issue . One dependent measure motor unit fire behaviour whilst contract submaximal target force . Typically clinician use manage motor disorder patient use cumbersome invasive technology measure motor unit limit accuracy . However , De Luca et al recently develop high density surface electromyographic ( HDsEMG ) system measure 30-40 motor unit 92-97 % accuracy . From propose highly effective tool evaluate efficacy therapeutic intervention upper motoneuron disorder MS . Accordingly investigator propose use repeat measure design experimental ( receive venoplasty ) control ( receive venoplasty ) MS group ( 6 patient group ) determine effect treatment muscular function , mobility fatigue . This would combine independent blinded neurological assessment two group patient . This design enable u achieve two aim : 1 . Acute neuromuscular response treatment 2 . Chronic response treatment ( 6 week ) determine effect muscular function , mobility fatigue . * Methods - Four ( first two establish baseline variability measure ) repeat visit laboratory University Stirling establish neuromuscular measure : 1 . HDsEMG pre post tetanic induce fatigue 2 . Muscle fibre conduction velocity previously describe ( Hunter et al. , 2011 ) 3 . Ultrasound CCSVI determination visit 1 3 4 . DEXA scan alteration body composition visit 2 4 - With use accelerometer monitor free living activity day 0-7 9-42 ( post venoplasty ) .</brief_summary>
