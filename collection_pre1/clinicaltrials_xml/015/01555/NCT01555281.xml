	<brief_summary>There great need treatment option patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) failure lenalidomide/dexamethasone regimen establish standard active therapy patient . Combining nelfinavir , drug target proteasome PI3K/Akt pathway , lenalidomide , may restore lenalidomide-sensitivity disease show vivo PI3K/Akt inhibitor perifosine proteasome inhibitor bortezomib . Patients expect included trial heavily pretreated might candidate intensive therapy . The combination nelfinavir lenalidomide/dexamethasone offer also patient alternative . Preliminary experience another SAKK trial combination bortezomib nelfinavir positive side effect nelfinavir dos 1875 mg twice daily ( bid ) . For phase I part trial start dose 1250 mg nelfinavir bid choose , since necessary plasma concentration nelfinavir reach low dos . In case progression trial treatment lenalidomide- bortezomib-based chemotherapy combination could option patient . However , addition chemotherapeutic drug like cyclophosphamide doxorubicin know side effect like hematological toxicity , nausea , vomit hair loss . The aim trial demonstrate combination nelfinavir lenalidomide/dexamethasone safe ( phase I , dose escalation nelfinavir ) active ( phase II ) . Patients respond trial medication stop trial treatment 4 month therapy late . If combination nelfinavir lenalidomide/dexamethasone prove safe efficient treatment lenalidomide-refractory MM , would first orally available treatment patient establish new class drug ( human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) protease inhibitor ) active antineoplastic agent MM . In addition would establish concept `` re-sensitizing '' patient lenalidomide therapy demonstrate effect nelfinavir proteasomal degradation Akt phosphorylation cancer patient vivo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disease background : MM plasma cell tumor . It account estimate 20,180 new case cancer 11,170 death United States 2010 . With prevalence 23 per 100,000 people , MM orphan disease ( prevalence &lt; 5:10,000 ) . The median age diagnosis 60-65 year . Although MM remain incurable , unprecedented gain survival outcome achieve last three decade . Survival improve mainly young patient age 65 advent high-dose melphalan therapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . In last 10 year introduction novel therapy , thalidomide , lenalidomide bortezomib improve overall survival . However , patient ultimately relapse require salvage therapy . Therapy background : The main decision criterion first-line treatment selection patient 's eligibility high-dose chemotherapy melphalan subsequent ASCT . Patients eligible treatment , due advance age , comorbidities poor performance status , routinely treat combination melphalan , prednisone novel agent thalidomide , bortezomib lenalidomide . Currently , patient relapse first line therapy median 2-3 year diagnosis . Achieving near complete remission maintain residual tumor mass control consider mainstay current treatment MM . Treatment relapsed/refractory myeloma base double triple combination novel agent lenalidomide bortezomib dexamethasone and/or cytotoxic drug alkylators anthracyclines . The choice regimen relapse depend frontline therapy well disease- therapy-related comorbidities . Although patient achieve long lasting remission novel agent MM remain chronic disease . Patients invariably relapse become refractory second later line treatment . Therefore new treatment option late-line patient require . The combination lenalidomide bortezomib report show activity subset lenalidomide bortezomib double-refractory patient phase I/II trial recent retrospective data suggest bortezomib contain regimen may active lenalidomide-refractory myeloma patient . There approved treatment option lenalidomide bortezomib double-refractory patient . Possible therapeutic alternative carfilzomib pomalidomide still clinical development date clinical trial open Switzerland . Therefore , treatment option lenalidomide-refractory patient remain limited . Preclinical result NCI60 cancer cell line panel show HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir exhibit wide spectrum antitumor activity . They inhibit proliferation 60 cancer cell line derive nine different tumor type . This consistent previous report demonstrate HIV protease inhibitor effective disease like MM Kaposi sarcoma . Nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest apoptosis tumor cell inhibition proteasomal degradation PI3K/Akt pathway . Therefore preclinical evidence underscore proteasome inhibiting activity nelfinavir . Modulation proteasome function rational approach overcome chemo-resistance achieve chemo-sensitization , suggest addition agent myeloma standard treatment could restore sensitivity standard therapy . Pharmacologic intervention PI3K/Akt pathway induce cell death MM cell line primary tumor sample . Inhibition Akt phosphorylation perifosine show significant clinical activity manageable toxicity patient relapsed/refractory MM combination dexamethasone alone ( ≥MR ( minor response ) 38 % ; SD ( stable disease ) 47 % ) , together lenalidomide dexamethasone ( ≥PR ( partial response ) 50 % , MR 20 % ) . These data suggest important role Akt pathway malignant growth survival MM cell also vivo . The addition nelfinavir standard lenalidomide/dexamethasone treatment lenalidomide-refractory patient expect restore sensitivity myeloma cell lenalidomide , act via inhibition PI3K/Akt pathway modulation proteasome function . Aim study demonstrate safety activity combine lenalidomide dexamethasone nelfinavir patient progressive MM fail lenalidomide-containing therapy . Treatment Nelfinavir : Nelfinavir mesylate ( Viracept ) inhibitor HIV protease 1 . Inhibition viral protease prevents cleavage Gag Gag-Pol polyproteins result production immature , non-infectious virus . The pharmacokinetic property nelfinavir evaluate healthy volunteer HIV-infected patient . No substantial difference observe two group . In Switzerland register dose nelfinavir treatment HIV-1 infection combination antiretroviral agent 1250 mg bid 750 mg three time daily ( tid ) . Plasma concentration pharmacokinetic study 10 HIV-positive patient multiple dose 1250 mg twice daily 28 day 4.0 mg/L ( peak plasma level ) 2.2 mg/L / 0.7 mg/L ( morning/evening trough ) , respectively . Peak plasma concentration approximately 6 microM . Nelfinavir serum extensively protein-bound ( &gt; 98 % ) . The area curve ( AUC ) 1.5 time higher bid regimen compare tid regimen , without significantly elevate toxicity . The maximal concentration nelfinavir usually achieve 3 4 hour administration food . The effective half-life blood plasma range 3 5 hour . Multi-dose pharmacokinetics nelfinavir , studied HIV-positive patient hepatic renal insufficiency . Nelfinavir inhibitor cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) mainly metabolize CYP3A4 CYP2C19 . The main metabolite nelfinavir ( hydroxylated metabolite nelfinavir M8 ) also active HIV circulate plasma around 30 % present nelfinavir amount . The dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define yet . A respective dose find trial nelfinavir mono-therapy patient solid tumor ongoing . Preliminary data trial show nelfinavir well tolerate 2.5 time ( 2 x 3125 mg/day ) American Food Drug Administration approve dose treatment HIV infection 2 x 1250 mg/day grade 4-5 clinical toxicity . The prevalent laboratory abnormality grade 4 dose level ( DL ) 3125 mg bid transaminitis , hyperglycemia diarrhea . The AUC nelfinavir plasma show plateau dos 1875 mg bid . A phase I study Nelfinavir liposarcoma maximum DL 4250 mg bid show peak plasma level 6.3 mg/L . One patient experience transient grade 3 pancreatitis one week nelfinavir . No DLTs observe . Recent test nelfinavir dose combination radiation therapy weekly gemcitabine ( 200-300 mg/m2 ) patient pancreatic cancer cause increase toxicity trial . The main side effect nelfinavir include diarrhea ( &gt; 10 % ) , rash , elevate liver enzyme , reduce blood count ( 1-10 % ) therapeutic standard concentration 1250 mg bid . Treatment Lenalidomide : Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) derivative thalidomide . The exact mechanism action immunomodulatory drug know . Apart interfere immune system , also think act angiogenesis . There multiple mechanism action , simplify organize mechanisms action vitro vivo . In vitro , lenalidomide three main activity : direct anti-tumor effect , inhibition micro-environmental support tumor cell , immunomodulatory role . In vivo , lenalidomide induces tumor cell apoptosis directly indirectly inhibition bone marrow stromal cell support , anti-angiogenic anti-osteoclastogenic effect , immunomodulatory activity . Lenalidomide broad range activity exploit treat many hematologic solid cancer . Lenalidomide one novel drug agent use treat MM . It small molecular analogue thalidomide originally find base ability effectively inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) production . Lenalidomide 50,000 time potent thalidomide inhibit TNF-α , less severe adverse drug reaction . The important side effect lenalidomide thromboembolism hematological toxicity . The common side effect neutropenia , thrombopenia , anemia , fatigue , constipation , diarrhea , asthenia rash . In contrast thalidomide , lenalidomide cause neuropathy . Hematotoxicity dose dependent easily manageable dose reduction . Lenalidomide combination dexamethasone Swissmedic approve treatment MM patient receive least one prior medicinal therapy . The combination lenalidomide dexamethasone compare dexamethasone alone lead significantly improve progression free survival ( median 11.1 vs. 4.6 month ) overall survival ( median 38.0 vs. 31.6 month ) patient relapse refractory myeloma two international phase III trial . More 1/3 patient previously treat structurally related thalidomide . Treatment Dexamethasone : Dexamethasone glucocorticosteroid use treatment MM , reduce activity immune system attach receptor various type immune cell . In MM , high-dose dexamethasone use together chemotherapy make chemotherapy effective reduce certain side effect cancer treatment , nausea vomiting . It appear cause apoptosis . This mean steroid dexamethasone trigger destruction myeloma cell . Typically dexamethasone give agent - vincristine , doxorubicin , thalidomide lenalidomide - treat MM . It find steroid increase ability chemotherapeutic immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide destroy myeloma cell .</detailed_description>
