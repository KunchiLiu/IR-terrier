	<brief_summary>Endotracheal tube subglottic secretion drainage ( incorporate suction port cuff ) show reduce incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia . Subglottic secretion drainage either continuous intermittent . However , concern safety continuous subglottic secretion drainage raise experimental study sheep , find widespread injury tracheal mucosa and/or submucosa . Our objective therefore compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage tracheal mucosa damage patient require mechanical ventilation expect duration 24 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal tube subglottic secretion drainage ( incorporate suction port cuff ) show reduce incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia . Subglottic secretion drainage either continuous intermittent . However , concern safety continuous subglottic secretion drainage raise experimental study sheep , find widespread injury tracheal mucosa and/or submucosa . Our objective therefore compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage tracheal mucosa damage patient require mechanical ventilation expect duration 24 hour . Tracheal mucosa injury assess tracheal fibroscopy . Secondary endpoint volume daily secretion suction , occurrence difficulty impossibilities secretion drainage , occurrence ventilator-associated pneumonia .</detailed_description>
