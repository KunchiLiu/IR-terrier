	<detailed_description>This four-week Phase IIa , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multi-center study evaluate safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics GSK1278863 approximately 68 subject anemia associate chronic kidney disease take rhEPO undergoing dialysis . The study consist screen phase 2 week , 4-week treatment phase 2-week follow-up phase . The range Hgb value study eligibility 8.5-11.0 g/dL . Eligible subject randomize equal proportion receive daily ( QD ) placebo GSK1278863 0.5 mg , 2 mg 5 mg double-blind fashion . Study treatment stop Hgb value fall outside range pre-specified protocol . This study aim estimate relationship dose GSK1278863 Hgb response correct anemia non-dialysis subject CKD take rhEPO ( NDD ) . In addition , study characterize effect GSK1278863 various pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) marker , investigate safety tolerability GSK1278863 . An early interim analysis Hgb data plan approximately 20 subject cohort 1 complete 3 week treatment . Depending upon interim finding , second cohort subject may add investigate additional GSK1278863 dose arm . Recruitment first cohort continue interim analysis . A second interim analysis plan approximately 48 subject cohort 1 complete 4 week treatment . The purpose interim three-fold , investigate whether second cohort subject may add , facilitate early development dose-response PK/PD statistical model , generate interim result facilitate design dose decision next trial . Subject completion define completion study phase include follow-up phase .</detailed_description>
