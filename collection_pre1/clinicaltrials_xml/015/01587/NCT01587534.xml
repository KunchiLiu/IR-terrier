	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer bad overall prognosis few 3 % affected patient alive Ô¨Åve year initial diagnosis . It fourth lead cause death cancer Korea . 80-90 % patient locally unresectable advanced metastatic disease patient palliative treatment option remain . Symptoms include obstructive jaundice , duodenal obstruction , pain , weight loss . Palliative treatment mainly direct former three . Interventions prevent ( ) weight loss yet receive little attention , spite frequent occurrence symptom . About 90 % patient pancreatic carcinoma weight loss time diagnosis . In addition , Weight loss prior chemotherapy find prognostic effect survival range different tumor type . There limited range study investigate incidence exocrine insufficiency pancreatic cancer . Studies available indicate high incidence exocrine insufficiency unresectable pancreatic cancer patient patient pancreatic cancer surgery . The previous report show 68-92 % pancreatic cancer patient exocrine insufficient . Such high incidence exocrine insufficiency pancreatic cancer patient support use pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy patient group . The guideline management patient pancreatic cancer periampullary ampullary carcinoma publish Gut promote use pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy maintain weight increase quality life patient group . However , study evaluate efficacy pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy pancreatic cancer lack date . There systematic review one randomize control trial involve small sample 21 patient unresectable cancer pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
