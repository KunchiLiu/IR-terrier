	<brief_summary>The study describe protocol perform within framework PROTECT ( Pharmacoepidemiological Research Outcomes Therapeutics European ConsorTium ) Workpackage 2 ( WP2 ) Workgroup 1 . The primary aim study develop , test disseminate methodological standard design , conduct analysis Pharmacoepidemiological ( PE ) study applicable different safety issue use different data source . To achieve , result PE study 5 key adverse event ( AEs ) perform different database evaluate . Therefore , emphasis methodological aspect study protocol clinical consequence association investigation . The standard develop contribute decrease discrepancy result different study future increase usefulness reliability study benefit-risk assessment EU . Within WP2 , five possible adverse event - drug pair select analysis ; one include possible role calcium channel blocker ( CCBs ) risk cancer . Analyses address hypothesis CCBs modify risk cancer ( forms cancer combine various group cancer ) . This hypothesis investigate use two source data : UK General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) Danish national database . Investigations UK may also use The Health Improvement Network ( THIN ) . The primary objective study investigate possible association use CCBs risk form cancer combine , among adult patient ( 18 79 year age study period , January 1 , 1996 December 31 , 2009 ) . The study conduct use three database different study design ( descriptive , cohort , population base cohort study nest case-control ) across different database ( GPRD , THIN , Danish databases ) compare result database , across design evaluate impact design/database/population difference outcome study association . Secondary objective investigate potential association use CCBs risk form breast cancer woman ; form prostate cancer ; form colon cancer use age group database ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Conducting study possible association CCBs cancer use pharmaco-epidemiological approach base data collect exist database cancer registry challenge . The challenge lie work within limitation available data ( term quality completeness ) simultaneously maximize value available data thoughtful study design statistical analysis . CCBs represent chemically pharmacologically diverse group agent widely use treatment hypertension angina . It propose CCBs may interfere apoptosis , lead increase potential abnormal cell proliferation tumor growth . The underlying biological mechanism effect think link role transmembrane Ca2+ . This hypothesis critically review result show action CCBs apoptosis complex increase decrease intracellular Ca2+ link form program cell death ( 2 ) . CCBs also show inhibit apoptosis certain non-transformed cell line promote apoptosis non-transformed transformed cell line . The result non-human genotoxicity study show link CCB use tumor development Epidemiologic study also provide inconsistent result . While follow-up analysis report increased risk cancer breast cancer , observational study far provide evidence support hypothesis long-term use CCBs might carcinogenic . As whole , study limit lack statistical power and/or inadequate method define exposure window antihypertensive treatment relation index date ( cancer outcome ) , make establishment causal relationship CCBs use risk cancer problematical . Studies often assume relatively short period CCB use ( usually 2 month 1 year ) entering study user . In case , information use CCBs available study entry follow-up . Overall , study limit follow-up period could consider brief measure carcinogenic effect . The vast majority study collect information electronic medical administrative database . The current study aim learn experience , strengths limitation previous research present best-practice approach address hypothesis question . Combined objective PROTECT program , hope study help provide framework guide methodological choice future research contribute increase usefulness reliability pharmacoepidemiological study benefit-risk assessment decision making .</detailed_description>
