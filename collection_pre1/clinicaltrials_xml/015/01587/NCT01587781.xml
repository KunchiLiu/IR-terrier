	<brief_summary>This study drug call enoxaparin use prevent treat blood clot . There study use drug obese adolescent yet investigator use prevent clot surgery Children 's National weight loss . The investigator hypothesis obesity lead increase kidney size faster drug clearance . Therefore investigator think might underdosing adolescent . This study check drug level different point drug dose see whether investigator achieve expected level prevention clot .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Use Enoxaparin Morbidly Obese Adolescents During Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enoxaparin drug choice prevention treatment venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) child adult . A major concern antithrombotic therapy increase risk hemorrhage . There many concrete data publish enoxaparin use child adolescent , absolutely guidance available ( morbidly ) obese child adolescent include clinical trial clinical phase drug development . Physicians often find puzzled selecting dose obese child . This study aim find optimal way dose enoxaparin ( morbidly ) obese child adolescent result safe effective use drug prophylaxis bariatric surgery . The optimum therapeutic/preventive dose drug depend pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property . Both process affect body composition physiological change occur obese child . Obesity increase total fat amount , also lean body mass . However , percentage fat tissue increase lean body mass . Obesity disease state also associate change plasma protein constituent , decrease tissue perfusion ; increase adipose tissue mass , lean body mass , cardiac output , splanchnic blood flow , compare normal-weight individual . High BMI believe independent risk factor VTE . Therefore , obese adolescent also prescribe prophylactic dos enoxaparin situation risk VTE . The 2008 recommend guideline American College Chest Physicians mention type dose consideration anticoagulant obese child . However , state high usual dos use adult patient undergo bariatric surgery . The use enoxaparin approve child use widely prophylaxis treatment VTE wide variety setting child age group . There limited number study involve enoxaparin use child . Out data available use enoxaparin treatment VTE prophylaxis VTE . Studies show several age relate physiologic difference pediatric adult patient . Neonates exhibit accelerated clearance rate large volume distribution compare adult . Children treat malignancy require high dos compare adult . Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study include child provide specific data different age group . Further , sample size small mostly involve patient treat VTE thrombophilia . There information specify dose prophylactic therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The research participant CNMC patient admit bariatric surgery . 2 . The age range 12 20 . 3 . All racial ethnic group include . 4 .

As standard , patient receive platelet inhibitor include acetylsalicylic acid , salicylate , NSAIDs ( include ketorolac tromethamine ) , dipyridamole , sulfinpyrazone would closely monitor . 2 . Any patient prior dose enoxaparin anticoagulant within past 24 hour would exclude .</criteria>
