	<detailed_description>Head neck malignancy represent group epithelial tumor arise oral cavity , pharynx , larynx account 3 5 % cancer United States . In 2010 , estimate 49,260 people ( 35,530 men 13,730 woman ) develop head neck cancer , estimate 11,480 death ( 8,300 men 3,180 woman ) occur . Three modality therapy establish role treatment carcinoma head neck : chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery . The choice modality depend upon many factor site extent primary lesion , likelihood complete surgical resection , presence lymph node metastasis , etc . Traditionally , small lesion ( stage T1-T2 ) effectively treat either , surgical excision irradiation whereas advance disease ( T3-T4 ) treat combined surgery radiation chemoradiation . The goal concurrent chemotherapy radiation increase locoregional control prevent distant metastasis . A specific concomitant chemoradiation protocol head neck cancer know RADPLAT employ pharmacologic principle technique describe . Capitalizing cisplatin-neutralizing agent sodium thiosulfate pharmacokinetic property , enormous concentration cisplatin infuse directly large head neck tumor target IA approach . In Phase I study , determine cisplatin could safely administer patient advance recurrent head neck cancer dose intensity 150mg/m2/week . The patient must consider clinical candidate either intra-arterial intravenous administration cisplatin eligible study . Once enrol registered study , subject randomize either intravenous intra-arterial administer cisplatin . Subjects assign 1:1 ratio intra-arterial versus intravenous administration . All patient receive concurrent radiation therapy . Standard institutional practice apply dose reduction treatment radiation therapy related toxicity . A combination lateral oppose field use treatment primary tumor site upper neck three dimensional CRT use applicable IMRT . A single anterior A-P field use treat lower neck primary tumor/upper neck . When positive node low neck , additional posterior field may necessary deliver supplemental dose positive node . All field must treat treatment session . The investigator measure feasibility study protocol enrollment screen failure data . The study test hypothesis intra-arterial cisplatin effective patient outcomes overall survival , disease free survival , cancer specific survival , rate local regional control cancer , site recurrence , organ preservation rate , toxicity , correlative specimen availability .</detailed_description>
