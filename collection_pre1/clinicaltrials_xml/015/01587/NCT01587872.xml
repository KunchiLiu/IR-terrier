	<brief_summary>The aim colonoscopy visualize inside entire large bowel . Several factor make procedure difficult , sometimes complete examination possible . Complicating factor include poor bowel preparation technical challenge difference anatomy ( long , redundant colonic segment ) , post-surgical adhesion , stricture diverticulosis . A special endoscope two inflatable balloon , originally design examine small bowel , use several year success technically difficult colonoscopy . More recently modify double-balloon instrument design specifically colonoscopy , documentation performance instrument limit . The aim present study investigate performance double-balloon colonoscope case conventional colonoscopy fail due technical difficulty .</brief_summary>
