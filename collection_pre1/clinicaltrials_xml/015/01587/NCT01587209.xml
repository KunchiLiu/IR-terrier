	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize membrane microparticles ( MPs ) liberate blood stream response decompression stress certain MPs characteristic initiate inflammatory response contribute clinical syndrome investigator call decompression sickness . The research goal evaluate number , type time-course elevation MPs sport SCUBA diver present treatment decompression sickness . Blood sample take consent patient undergo treatment decompression sickness follow-up clinic visit 1 3 week later ( three sample total ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Microparticles ( MPs ) small membrane bound vesicle shed surface variety cell appear well regulate process . They elevate many physiological disease state instance associate organ injury . Shear stress - cause intravascular bubble - one stimulus know cause cell release microparticles . Most sport SCUBA dive show generate intravascular bubble - even safe dive well within limit establish US Navy sport authority . The investigator report elevation several sub-types MPs group individual undergo well monitor series open-water SCUBA dive . There information occurrence MPs injure diver . The investigator publish result use murine model demonstrate mice subject vary decompression stress exhibit progressive elevation circulate MPs derive leukocyte , erythrocyte , platelet endothelial cell . Using novel intervention investigator demonstrate MPs cause intravascular neutrophil activation inflammatory perivascular injury . Therefore , pathophysiological information suggest one element MPs ( number and/or pro-inflammatory subtype ) may proximal element precipitate clinical syndrome investigator call decompression sickness .</detailed_description>
