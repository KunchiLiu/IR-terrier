	<brief_summary>After spinal cord injury , patient develop spastic syndrome characterize hyperactive reflex , increase muscle tone , clonus involuntary muscle spasm . The neuronal mechanism behind development spasticity remain largely unknown , though animal experiment show change occur level motoneuron sensory neuron . This project aim examine change occur modulation sensory afferent transmission spinal cord injury , change contribute trigger initiation muscle spasm chronic spinal cord injury human . It known spinal cord injury , majority descending source monoamine , serotonin ( 5HT ) , abolish . Animal experiment show 5HT receptor sensory neuron spinal cord responsible inhibit sensory transmission . As result , spinal cord injury receptor longer activated injury , result production large , long excitatory response motoneuron sensory activate . This large sensory activation motoneuron , turn , activate long response motoneuron produce involuntary muscle spasm . The aim study determine whether , similar animal experiment , 5HT1 receptor responsible sensory inhibition spinal cord injure subject , whether activate receptor ( 5HT1 agonist Zolmitriptan ) restore normal inhibition sensory transmission lose injury , thereby result decrease initiation involuntary muscle spasm .</brief_summary>
