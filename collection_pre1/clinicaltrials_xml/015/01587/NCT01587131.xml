	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether FVH1 , DNA-based influenza vaccine , safe generally well tolerate healthy elderly adult volunteer result great immunogenicity use prime immune response dose trivalent inactivate seasonal vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use DNA plasmid contain gene express viral antigen may promise way formulate vaccine effectively prevent infection disease cause H1N1 influenza virus . Plasmid vector simple construct easy manufacture relatively low cost . Vaccination plasmids express influenza proteins induce development serum antibody might also induce significant quantity secretory IgA antibody and/or CMI . The DNA sequence include vaccine could also result proliferation T lymphocyte could broaden effectiveness vaccine include variant strain H1N1 antigenically modify HA ( i.e. , drift strain ) . Electroporation ( EP ) technology transmembrane electrical field apply increase permeability cell membrane create microscopic pathway ( pore ) thereby enhance uptake drug , vaccine , agent target cell . Their presence allow macromolecule , ion , water pas one side membrane . The presence constant field influence kinetics directional translocation macromolecular plasmid , plasmid delivery vivo sufficient achieve physiological level secrete protein . ID injection plasmid follow EP use successfully deliver therapeutic gene encode variety hormone , cytokine , enzyme variety specie . EP currently use human deliver cancer vaccine therapeutic well gene therapy . The expression level increase much 3 order magnitude plasmid injection alone . The use EP via CELLECTRA® device increase expression H1N1 influenza virus gene study vaccine .</detailed_description>
