	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety feasibility Prima-Temp Thermometer Patch determine baseline temperature research subject hospital intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Primary Objective : Assess safety Prima-Temp temperature patch nursing staff skin site assessment . Secondary Objective : Establish individual subject baseline temperature use intermittent temperature measurement ( every 5 minute ) Prima-Temp thermometer patch wireless transmission data receiver box HIPAA compliant , centrally locate personal computer ( PC ) compare research subject 's baseline temperature temperatures take ICU normal course care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The manifestation fever characteristic essential care intensive care unit patient . As marker infection disease process , presence fever temperature peak must reliably obtain ICU patient must monitor closely optimize effective therapy . Inherent variability different temperature measurement method lead difficulty determine optimal time medical intervention . Ideally , nurse medical staff acute care hospital facility could temperature monitor system aid recognition fever systemic infection labor intensive provide consistent reliable temperature . Automatic transmission data recorder lessen chance manual entry error medical record . Frequent measurement allow establishment patient 's individual baseline temperature provide individualize guideline medical intervention increase 2°F baseline documentation fever . Finally , frequent temperature monitor minimally invasive comfortable patient .</detailed_description>
