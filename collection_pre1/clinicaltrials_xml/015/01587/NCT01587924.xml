	<detailed_description>This four-week , Phase IIa , randomize , active-controlled , parallel-group , multi-center study evaluate safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics switch subject stable rhEPO GSK1278863 approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subject anemia associate chronic kidney disease . The study consist screen phase 2 week , 4-week treatment phase 2-week follow-up phase . The range Hgb value study eligibility 9.5-12.0 g/dL subject must receive rhEPO product total weekly dos vary 50 % 4 week prior Screening visit ( Week -1 . Eligible subject , stratify prior rhEPO dose randomize equal proportion receive double-blind GSK1278863 0.5 mg , 2 mg 5 mg QD ( discontinue rhEPO ) , continue receive exist type dose rhEPO ( epoetins biosimilars , darbepoetin ) . Study treatment stop Hgb value fall outside protocol pre-specified range . Subject completion define completion study phase include follow-up phase . This study aim estimate relationship dose GSK1278863 Hgb response hemodialysis-dependent ( HDD ) subject anemia associate chronic kidney disease switch stable maintenance dose recombinant human erythropoetin ( rhEPO ) . In addition , study characterize effect GSK1278863 various pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker , investigate safety tolerability GSK1278863 . An early interim analysis Hgb data plan approximately 20 subject cohort 1 complete 3 week treatment . Depending upon interim finding , second cohort subject may add investigate additional GSK1278863 dose arm . Recruitment first cohort continue interim analysis . A second interim analysis plan approximately 48 subject cohort 1 complete 4 week treatment . The purpose interim three-fold , investigate second cohort subject may add , facilitate early development dose-response PK/PD statistical model , generate interim result facilitate design dose decision next trial .</detailed_description>
