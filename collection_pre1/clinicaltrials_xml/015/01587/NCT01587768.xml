	<brief_summary>The study describe protocol perform within framework PROTECT ( Pharmacoepidemiological Research Outcomes Therapeutics European ConsorTium ) Workpackage 2 ( WP2 ) Workgroup 1 . The primary aim study develop , test disseminate methodological standard design , conduct analysis Pharmacoepidemiological ( PE ) study applicable different safety issue use different data source . To achieve , result PE study 5 key adverse event ( AEs ) perform different database evaluate . Therefore , emphasis methodological aspect study protocol clinical consequence association investigation . The standard develop contribute decrease discrepancy result different study future increase usefulness reliability study benefit-risk assessment EU . We propose assess association antibiotic use idiopathic acute liver injury different study design ( descriptive , cohort , nest case-control case crossover ) across different primary care databases compare result database , across design evaluate impact design/database/population difference outcome study association . Specific aim ( database ) : 1 . To describe characteristic , clinical feature , risk factor acute liver injury patient expose unexposed antibiotic . 2 . To estimate overall risk acute liver injury associate antibiotic exposure ( users non-users ) database 3 . To estimate risk acute liver injury associate various antibiotic class 4 . To estimate risk acute liver injury associate specific individual antibiotic 5 . To assess effect dose duration use specific individual antibiotic . 6 . To compare result case-control study result retrospective cohort study self-controlled case series study different databases The propose study collect population follow database : The General Practice Research Database [ GPRD ] ( UK ) , Health Improvement Network [ THIN ] ( UK ) , BIFAP [ Base de datos Informatizada para estudios Farmacoepidemiologicos en Atencion Primaria ] ( Spain ) - Bavarian Claims Database ( Germany ) , Mondriaan ( Netherlands ) , National Databases Denmark .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute liver injury one important safety concern , lead cause drug withdrawal market safety ground . For suspected hepatotoxic drug exist information come spontaneous report , lack appropriate risk quantification formal epidemiological study . A population-based study examine risk acute clinically relevant liver injury among user various drug publish , report elevate risk liver injury user antibiotic . As acute liver injury often idiosyncratic diagnostic criterion use epidemiological study variable , report range incidence acute liver injury cause antibiotic broad . In United Kingdom ( UK ) , case-control study investigate effect antibiotic acute liver injury generate odds ratio range 94.8 combination amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 6.2 tetracycline . Age , sex , alcohol intake , concomitant medication comorbidities propose risk factor antibiotic induce liver injury may influence quantification risk estimate . In present protocol , propose quantify risk acute liver injury associate antibiotic general population use different study design different primary care database , compare result evaluate impact design population difference outcome study association . Acute liver injury hepatotoxicity study implies chemical , drug drive liver damage classify base clinical presentation laboratory feature range asymptomatic mild biochemical abnormality acute liver failure . The common classification use drug induce liver injury ( DILI ) accord laboratory abnormality ( hepatocellular , cholestatic mixed ) accord mechanism toxicity ( direct , immune-mediated , idiosyncratic , mitochondrial toxicity ) . Being idiosyncratic case , reaction often reproduce experimentally laboratory animal . The relationship dose occurrence severity reaction constant , latent period drug exposure sensitivity reaction rather variable . The infrequency DILI , though significant impact , complicate case ascertainment pharmacoepidemiological study lead wide range report incidence rate . A recent study , use data GPRD database , report crude incidence rate liver injury cause type drug range 1 18 per 100,000 prescription . The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network ( DILIN ) , US base collaboration academic health institution study aetiology prevention DILI , find antibiotics large class agent cause drug-induced liver injury . UK base estimate incidence rate antibiotic induce liver injury range 2.5 8.6 per 100,000 user . Antibiotics type antimicrobial use treat infection amongst twenty prescribe drug England , approximately 38.7 million prescription dispensed 2009 . The frequently prescribe type antibiotic penicillin , group bactericidal antibiotic interfere bacterial cell wall synthesis . Other bactericidal antibiotic include cephalosporin aminoglycosides . Antibiotics bacteriostatic mechanism action , inhibit growth proliferation bacterial cell , include tetracycline , macrolides , sulphonamides quinolones . Most types antibiotic associate drug-induced liver injury . Liver injury account 10 % adverse reaction drug frequent reason withdrawal medication market . This study would provide valuable contribution current knowledge drug induce liver injury common cause acute liver failure antibiotic large drug class agent , high exposure prevalence , cause acute liver injury .</detailed_description>
