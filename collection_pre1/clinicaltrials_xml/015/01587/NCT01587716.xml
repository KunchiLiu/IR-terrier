	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) effect GSK2339345 healthy subject . GSK2339345 blocker neuronal voltage gate sodium channel development treatment chronic cough , excessive cough post-viral viral ( acute ) cough . Inhaled pan NaV inhibitor associate oropharyngeal sensation perturbation study establish potential local sensate effect GSK2339345 multiple predict inhaled therapeutic dose . This study also aim define maximum tolerate dose GSK2339345 administer via aqueous droplet inhaler . Cohort 1 randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over , inhaled single-dose escalating study use aqueous droplet inhaler . Cohort 1 include assessment sensate change via 4 point scale , assessment taste via 11 point scale , PK assessments investigate PK profile GSK2339345 . Cohort 2 study randomise , double blind , placebo control , parallel group , inhale repeat dose study use aqueous droplet inhaler . Subjects randomise receive 2000 microgram GSK2339345 placebo four time day two consecutive study day . Similar assessment sensation use Cohort 1 perform . The potential systemic cardiovascular ( CV ) central nervous system ( CNS ) effect also assess throughout study via observation . Cohort 2 also include PK assessment investigate PK profile GSK2339345 . Placebo use throughout study control .</detailed_description>
