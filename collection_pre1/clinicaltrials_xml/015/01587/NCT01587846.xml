Although evidence probiotic increase stool frequency decrease stool consistency healthy individual evidence efficacy constipation limit . Children functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) constipation include study . Children FAP randomize one two group receive either L. reuteri daily dose 108 CFU , placebo three month . Children chronic constipation receive either L. reuteri daily dose 108 CFU lactulose , placebo lactulose . Frequency intensity episodes abdominal pain intervention record child FAP . Frequency defecation , stool consistency need lactulose record child chronic constipation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Reuteri Treatment Functional Abdominal Pain Chronic Constipation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part I. Lactobacillus reuteri treatment functional abdominal pain child 1 . Introduction Probiotics define live microorganism confer beneficial health effect human host . Their beneficial effect base : promotion resistance enteric pathogen , prevention small bowel bacterial overgrowth immune system modulation . The commonly use probiotic bacteria genera Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium . Other nonpathogenic genus , include Escherichia , Enterococcus Bacillus , nonbacterial organism , nonpathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii , also study . A probiotic preparation must contain certain minimum number colony-forming unit ( CFU ) per dose ( 4 ) . Doses use therapeutic preventive trial vary . A daily intake 1.000.000 1.000.000.000 CFUs report minimum therapeutic purpose . There increase number study beneficial effect probiotic treatment acute infectious diarrhoea , prevention antibiotic associate diarrhoea . Role probiotic treatment functional GI disorder still controversial . Recurrent chronic abdominal pain affect 10-15 % school-age child . Functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) define occasional continuous abdominal pain frequency least weak least two month ; frequently pain locate around umbilicus related meal . Although visceral hypersensitivity play certain role pathogenesis pain , FAP probably complex disorder . Irritable bowel syndrome define abdominal pain discomfort associate ( least 25 % time ) two criterion : 1 ) relief defecation , 2 ) change stool frequency 3 ) change stool consistence . Pathogenesis disorder complex include interaction psychosocial factor , motility disorder visceral hypersensitivity . Therapeutic possibility pepermint oil , serotonin reuptake inhibitor tricyclic antidepressant . Although study confirm positive effect probiotic child adult IBS , clear evidence effect probiotic FAP . The number study patient include also relatively small draw final conclusion . Therefore , aim study investigate whether Lactobacillus reuteri could beneficial role treatment functional abdominal pain child . 2 . Study population All paediatric patient refer pediatric gastroenterologist functional abdominal pain ( age 4-18 year ) Department Paediatrics , Children 's Hospital Zagreb , University Hospital `` Sestre Milosrdnice '' . Their symptom evaluate use Rome III criterion functional gastrointestinal disorder child visual-analogue scale ( Wong-Baker face pain rating scale ) pain . 3 . Intervention All child functional abdominal pain whose parent sign inform consent ; receive either probiotic placebo 3 month . As part randomize , double blind control trail , patient randomize one group ( A B ) none investigator patient know true nature product ( active product placebo ) . 4 . Hypothesis L. reuteri effectively treat functional abdominal pain child . 5 . Aims To evaluate effect L. reuteri number severity episodes pain child functional abdominal pain 6 . Sample size independent cohort study Probability event control group = 0,5 Difference group : 30 % ( ref . 18 ) Probability event experimental group = 0,35 Controls per case subject = 1 Alpha = 0,05 Power = 0,95 For Fisher 's exact test : N ( total ) = 2x138 ( 69 per group ) 7 . Randomization The trial prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo control study . Probiotics , Lactobacillus reuteri placebo supply Biogaia , Stockholm , Sweden . Randomization perform use computer generate number base every patient get number receive preparation successively . All product , probiotic placebo pack identical package identical smell taste mark `` A '' `` B '' , true nature preparation would reveal investigator participant . After calculation statistical analysis true nature preparation reveal front uninvolved witness . BASELINE ( VISIT 1 ) : randomization VISIT 2 : 4 week randomization END OF STUDY ( VISIT 3 ) : End study 3 month baseline VISIT 4 : 4 week end study ( 16 week baseline ) . All symptom monitor use diary attach protocol . In order achieve adherence therapeutic protocol parent contact phone least 7-10 day . Participants instructed keep diary daily basis ( adherence therapy , pain diary ) . All patient return package use , unused product . Part II . Lactobacillus reuteri treatment chronic constipation child - randomize , double blind , placebo control study 1 . Introduction Defecation disorder frequent problem childhood 90-95 % child present functional problem . Chronic constipation childhood define least two criterion : 1 ) stool twice weak rarer , 2 ) least one episode fecal incontinence per weak already achieve toilet control , 3 ) stool withhold manoeuvre , 4 ) painful difficult defecation , 5 ) presence large fecal mass rectum , 6 ) stool large caliber . In adult , evidence chronic constipation relate gastrointestinal flora decrease number lactobacilli bifidobacteria increase potentially pathogenic bacteria , yeast fungi . Dysbiosis increase clostridia also report child chronic constipation . Majority infants high frequency defecation consistency stool soft breast-fed infant first month life . Breast-fed baby produce lactic acid colon decrease intestinal pH . As result bifidobacteria proliferate . Also , colonic flora show influence peristalsis . Although evidence lactobacillus bifidobacteria increase stool frequency decrease stool consistency normal individual evidence efficacy constipation limit . Therefore , aim study investigate whether Lactobacillus reuteri could beneficial role treatment chronic constipation child . 2 . Study population All paediatric patient refer pediatric gastroenterologist chronic constipation ( age 2-18 year ) Department Paediatrics , Children 's Hospital Zagreb , University Hospital `` Sestre Milosrdnice '' . Their symptom evaluate use Rome III criterion functional gastrointestinal disorder child , Bristol scale stool shape consistence visual-analogue scale ( Wong-Baker face pain rating scale ) pain . 3 . Intervention All child chronic constipation whose parent sign inform consent ; randomly assign one two follow group : probiotic placebo . 1 . Group receive L. reuteri dose 100.000.000 CFU per dose plus lactulose dose 1-3 ml/kg , accord stool frequency consistency , 3 month . 2 . Group receive placebo plus lactulose dose 1-3 ml/kg , accord stool frequency consistency , 3 month . All child presence impact stool rectum ( digital rectal exam ) baseline receive bisacodyl suppository disimpaction . As part randomize , double blind control trail , patient randomize one group ( A B ) none investigator patient know true nature product ( active product placebo ) . 4 . Hypothesis L. reuteri may effectively treat chronic constipation child . 5 . Aims To evaluate effect L. reuteri frequency consistency stool episode pain child chronic constipation 6 . Randomization : Part I. BASELINE ( VISIT 1 ) : randomization According list patient randomize two group ( A B ) : `` probiotic '' group `` placebo '' group . VISIT 2 : 4 week randomization . END OF STUDY ( VISIT 3 ) : End study 3 month baseline . VISIT 4 : 4 week end study ( 16 week baseline ) . All symptom monitor use diary attach protocol . ETHICS : Part I.
