	<detailed_description>The existence , diagnosis treatment short esophagus one controversy past within esophageal surgery recently re-emerge . This entity describe detail radiologist 60 's . Many surgeon confirm existence operating room , describe clinical , anatomical surgical pattern along modality surgical treatment shorten esophagus follow progressive fibrosis retraction esophageal wall consequent severe long stand gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Contrarily surgeon deny existence claim gastro-esophageal ( GEJ ) junction reduce abdomen without tension virtually patient esophagus , fact , shorten . In case series open antireflux surgery , percentage dedicate procedure aim treat condition non-reducibility GEJ diaphragm highly variable . In present era minimally invasive antireflux surgery , short esophagus seem originate controversy open debate . Many thousand laparoscopic standard antireflux operation perform world numerous article report satisfactory short medium-term functional result 90 % case , although experience need tailor approach emerge . However , last year , many report diagnosis laparoscopic management shorten esophagus GERD surgery publish . The perception `` excessive tension '' fundoplication operate table highly subjective . During process progressive shortening esophagus , portion fundus attract diaphragm may take appearance funnel hardly distinguishable thicken oesophagus . Therefore gastric fundus may erroneously wrap around herniated stomach . Through laparoscopic surgery , cranially distend diaphragmatic hiatus pneumoperitoneum may artefact increase length intra-abdominal esophagus , impossibility manually palpate feel tension apply esophagus bring GEJ diaphragm may make difficult recognize condition shorten esophagus , experience surgeon adequate . The different method adopt surgeon assess length elasticity esophagus position esophago-gastric junction respect hiatus cause disagreement . The missed diagnosis short esophagus consequent inadequacy treatment one major cause failure antireflux surgery . As number antireflux operation , mainly laparoscopic , perform per year remarkably increase , issue so-called short esophagus today one major point management antireflux surgery , deserve reappraisal definitive clarification . The daily clinical practice surgeon dedicate therapy esophageal disease could take advantage definition frequency , preoperative predictor , intraoperative management post operative outcome case foreshorten esophagus order offer patient affect GERD , elements necessary conscious choice therapy plan best performance surgical procedure . Aim study : define percentage case among total antireflux procedure perform type II-IV hiatus hernia , , standard isolation GEJ eventual dissection mediastinal esophagus least two centimetre esophagus replace without applied tension apex diaphragmatic hiatus ; record intra-operative , postoperative outcome procedure adopt surgical treatment type II-IV hiatus hernia .</detailed_description>
