	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall objective response rate ( RR ) vorinostat patient metastatic uveal melanoma harbor guanine nucleotide bind protein ( G protein ) , q polypeptide ( GNAQ ) guanine nucleotide bind protein ( G protein ) , alpha 11 ( Gq class ) ( GNA11 ) mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival ( OS ) . II . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . To determine tolerability vorinostat patient metastatic uveal melanoma . IV . To correlate overall objective RR GNAQ , GNA11 breast cancer 1 ( BRCA1 ) associate protein-1 ( ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase ) ( BAP1 ) mutational status . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate clinical outcome change histone acetylation status immunohistochemistry . II . To correlate clinical outcome change know proliferation apoptotic marker include Ki67 immunohistochemistry BCL2-like 11 ( apoptosis facilitator ) ( BIM ) , baculoviral IAP repeat contain 5 ( survivin ) , v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( c-myc ) , myeloid cell leukemia 1 ( Mcl-1 ) , cleave poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP ) , gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( gamma-H2AX ) RAD51 recombinase ( RAD51 ) western blot . III . To assess change pathways mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway treatment . IV . To describe evolution circulate cell-free , tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) level measure pyrophosphorolysis activate polymerization ( PAP ) plasma patient treatment metastatic uveal melanoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 3 day weekly 4 week . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
