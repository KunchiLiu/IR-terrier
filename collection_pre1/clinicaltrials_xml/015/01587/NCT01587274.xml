	<brief_summary>Low back pain cause 2.4 % visit US emergency department ( ED ) result 2.7 million visit annually . In general low back pain ( LBP ) population , prognosis poor . About 50 % patient visit general practitioner new onset musculoskeletal LBP report persistent pain functional disability three month index visit . Outcomes similarly poor population patient force use ED management LBP . In observational study patient non-traumatic LBP recently complete PI 's institution , patient contact one week ED discharge : 70 % report persistent back-pain related functional impairment , 59 % report moderate severe LBP , 69 % report analgesic use within previous 24 hour . Three month ED visit , 48 % report functional impairment , 42 % report moderate severe pain , 46 % report analgesic use within previous 24 hour . A variety evidence-based medication available treat LBP . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) efficacious placebo regard pain relief , global improvement , requirement analgesic medication . Skeletal muscle-relaxants effective short-term pain relief global efficacy . Opioids commonly use moderate severe acute LBP , ( 9 ) though high-quality evidence support practice lacking . Treatment LBP multiple concurrent medication common ED setting . Emergency physician often prescribe NSAIDs , skeletal muscle relaxant , opioids combination . Several clinical trial compare combination therapy NSAIDS+ skeletal muscle relaxant monotherapy one agent . These trial report heterogeneous result . The combination opioids + NSAIDS evaluate experimentally patient acute LBP . Given poor pain functional outcome persist beyond ED visit musculoskeletal LBP , investigator propose clinical trial evaluate whether combine muscle relaxant opioids NSAIDs effective NSAID monotherapy treatment non-traumatic , non-radicular low back pain . Specifically , investigator evaluate three distinct hypothesis : 1 . The combination naproxen + cyclobenzaprine provide great relief LBP naproxen alone seven day ED visit , measure Roland Morris low back pain functional disability scale 2 . The combination naproxen + oxycodone/ acetaminophen provide great relief LBP naproxen alone seven day ED visit , measure Roland Morris low back pain functional disability scale 3 . The combination naproxen + oxycodone/ acetaminophen provide great relief LBP naproxen + cyclobenzaprine seven day ED visit , measure Roland Morris low back pain functional disability scale</brief_summary>
