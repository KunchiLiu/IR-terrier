	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Single Doses Inhaled GSK1995057</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomise , placebo-controlled study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics single dos inhale GSK1995057 healthy subject . The study consist 2 part total 6 cohort . Part 1 conduct singleblind Part 2 conduct single-blind restriction ( i.e . subject investigator ) . The GSK Study Team site pharmacist remain unblinded treatment allocation . Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 4 ( Part 1 ) receive single inhale dose GSK1995057 placebo . Cohort 5 receive single inhale dose GSK1995057 addition bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) sample procedure conduct approximately 30 minute post GSK1995057 dose . Subjects Cohort 6 ( Part 2 ) randomise receive high dose GSK1995057 placebo follow inhaled LPS challenge BAL sampling procedure . Subjects require visit clinic course 28 day dose period follow . Further visit immunogenicity sampling may conduct 56 84 day post-first dose subject show change indicate positive ADA response dose . Doses level stipulate within protocol target dos base prediction use PK/PD model describe Section 1.2.2 clinical protocol . Part 1 commence first follow acceptable safety tolerability data allow initiation Part 2 . All cohort participate single study session .</detailed_description>
