Diagnosis one following : Part 1 Only : NUT Midline Carcinoma base ectopic expression NUT protein determine IHC and/or detection NUT gene translocation determine FISH . Subjects may treatment naïve prior therapy ; SCLC , CRC , NB , TNBC , ER positive BC , CRPC , NSCLC solid tumor confirm clinical testing MYCN amplify ( define MYCN gene copy number gain &gt; =5 ) . Subjects tumor progression receive least one prior standard/approved chemotherapy , approve therapy , standard therapy refuse . Part 2 : NUT Midline Carcinoma diagnose Central Laboratory . Subjects may treatment naïve prior therapy . SCLC , CRPC , TNBC ER+BC . Subjects solid tumor , exception CRPC , must demonstrate measurable disease , per RECIST v1.1 . NOTE : Subjects NMC meet RECIST v1.1 criterion measurable disease , evaluable disease may consider enrollment discussion GSK medical monitor..

A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) great 40 milli international unit/mL estradiol le 40 pg/mL ( le 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ; Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method ( describe protocol ) appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point .

Antiandrogen ( e.g. , bicalutamide ) therapy prostate cancer must stop 4 week prior enrollment . Second line hormone therapy enzalutamide , abiraterone , orteronel stop 2 week prior enrollment . Subjects prostate cancer remain luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists antagonist . Subjects prostate cancer may also remain lowdose prednisone prednisolone ( 10 mg/day ) still eligible study . Current use anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin , heparin ) therapeutic level within 7 day prior first dose GSK525762 . Low dose ( prophylactic ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) permit . In addition , INR must monitor accordance local institutional practice . Current use prohibit medication require medication treatment investigational drug ( detail available protocol ) . This include exclude current medication know suspect associated QT prolongation . In addition , subject may require QT prolong medication trial enrol . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , hepatic , renal , cardiac disease , clinically significant bleed episode ) . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical ( aside malignancy exception ) , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study procedure , opinion Investigator . Symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal brain metastasis spinal cord compression . NOTE : Subjects previously treat condition stable central nervous system disease ( verified consecutive imaging study ) &gt; 1 month , asymptomatic corticosteroid , stable dose corticosteroid least 1 month prior study Day 1 permit . Stability brain metastasis must confirm imaging . Subject treat gamma knife enrol 2 week postprocedure long postprocedure complications/stable . In addition , subject treat currently take enzymeinducing anticonvulsant allow study . Cardiac abnormality evidence follow : History current `` untreated '' clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia ; Clinically significant conduction abnormality arrhythmias , subject Bundle Branch Block ; Presence cardiac pacemaker ; History evidence current &gt; =Class II congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) ; History acute coronary syndrome ( include unstable angina myocardial infarction ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting within past 3 month . Any following ECG finding : Baseline QTcF interval &gt; =450 millisecond ( msec ) ; Any clinically significant ECG assessment review site cardiologist prior study entry . GSK525762 benzodiazepine class molecule . Any serious know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction ( ) GSK525762 idiosyncrasy drug chemically related investigational drug . Hemoptysis &gt; 1 teaspoon 24 hour within last 28 day . History major gastrointestinal bleeding within last 6 month . Any evidence active gastrointestinal bleeding excludes subject .
