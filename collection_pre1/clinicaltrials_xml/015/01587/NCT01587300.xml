	<brief_summary>Medical scientist want find good way treat neuroblastoma find way prevent tumor grow back . To , need information characteristic neuroblastoma cell . Therefore , want study sample neuroblastoma tissue neuroblastoma normal cell blood bone marrow may relate growth neuroblastoma cell . Doctors medical scientist also want find good way detect measure neuroblastoma improve ability follow response tumor cell therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroblastoma Biology Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study : To establish storage place bank sample blood , bone marrow , and/or tumor , molecular component isolate sample child neuroblastoma . The stored specimen share laboratory researcher study high risk neuroblastoma . To evaluate new test blood bone marrow specimens find tumor cell . The result new test , call 5-gene TaqManÂ® Low Density Array TLDA , compare blood bone marrow imaging ( radiology ) study . Radiology study ( CT scan , MRI scan , MIBG scan ) TLDA test compare ability measure amount tumor present change therapy . To collect clinical data ( treatment receive , date diagnosis , tumor stage , etc ) radiology scan provide information need laboratory study do specimen . To obtain neuroblastoma tumor cell tumor tissue , bone marrow , and/or blood use start cell line , tumor cell keep grow laboratory . These cell line share laboratory researcher study high risk neuroblastoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must great 31 day age . Patients must diagnosis high risk neuroblastoma either histological verification neuroblastoma and/or demonstration tumor cell bone marrow increase urinary catecholamine . All patient refractory recurrent high risk neuroblastoma NANT institution eligible regardless disease status ( include measurable evaluable tumor ) long undergo disease evaluation appropriate sample submit . Additionally , patient high risk neuroblastoma without relapse treat NANT institution eligible undergoing disease evaluation , long Children 's Oncology Group specimens prioritize . There exclusion criterion study .</criteria>
