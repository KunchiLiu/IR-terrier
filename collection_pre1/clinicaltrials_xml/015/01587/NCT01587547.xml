	<brief_title>Amino Acid Profiling Spent Culture Medium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IVF/ICSI treatment permit many thousand couple conceive worldwide yet limit low success rate ( UK , approx . 25 % live birth rate/treatment cycle woman 42 year age ; HFEA Annual Report , 2006 ) confound high multiple birth rate ( 23 % ) due transfer single pre-implantation embryo . Multiple birth associate prematurity , increase neonatal maternal mortality child handicap well major burden health care system . These problem highlight data publish HFEA ( 2009 ) , call `` professionally-led , coordinated national strategy reduce number multiple birth '' . This challenge could meet single embryo know developmental competence could select transfer , thereby make embryo selection process even crucial . However , current non-invasive embryo selection criterion use light microscope analysis limit predictive value ongoing pregnancy .</detailed_description>
