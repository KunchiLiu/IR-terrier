	<detailed_description>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment sight-threatening condition occur neurosensory retina separate underlie retinal pigment epithelium fluid accumulates within potential space.Surgical reattachment detach retina mainstay treatment . Experimental retinal detachment reattachment model demonstrate recovery process successfully reattached retina , include regrowth reconfiguration photoreceptor inner and/or outer segment , reorganization photoreceptor-RPE interface , increase synaptic terminal outer plexiform layer , inhibition glial cell proliferation , recovery normal distribution protein . These microscopic change think reason visual function recovery follow retinal reattachment . Recent development spectral domain optical coherence tomography , provide faster image speed high resolution , allow detailed retinal layer evaluation . Previous study use spectral domain optical coherence tomography reveal abnormality retinal microstructure reattached retina . However , study mainly focus photoreceptor layer and/or external limit membrane , although abnormality various retinal layer reveal previous microscopic study . In addition , qualitative rather quantitative analysis perform study , importantly , previous study observational comparison affect normal control region perform . The current study involve series recent-onset primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment manage surgical retinal reattachment . The investigator quantify thickness retinal layer base spectral domain optical coherence tomography image compare thickness reattached region undetached normal region . The primary purpose study evaluate change thickness profile retinal layer reattached retina acute RRD .</detailed_description>
