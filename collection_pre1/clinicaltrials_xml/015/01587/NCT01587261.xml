	<brief_summary>Animal human data support notion administration large dos Vitamin C beneficial effect subject suffer large burn . This effect may due , part , antioxidant free-radical-scavenging property Vitamin C. These study demonstrate improvement urine output resuscitation reduce need fluid volume resuscitation . In turn , subject demonstrate reduction wound edema , improve respiratory status ( demonstrated improvement P : F ratio reduce ventilator day ) , difference term possible complication high-dose vitamin C administration standard treatment group . The purpose study prospectively determine Vitamin C safely use adjunctive treatment patient suffer severe thermal injury . High-dose vitamin C administer dose 66mg/kg/hr acute phase severe burn injury reduce fluid requirement first 48 hour injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin C Severe Thermal Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects present within 6 hour severe thermal injury , define great 20 % total body surface area , family member approach admission Parkland Memorial Hospital inform study . Those elect participate study randomize receive either high-dose vitamin C ( 66mg/kg/hr first 24 hour , dosage base prior human study ) addition standard resuscitation algorithm ( per Parkland Formula ) control group receive standard resuscitation algorithm . These subject follow hospital course fluid requirement , urine output , infectious complication rate , liver/renal failure rate , abdominal compartment syndrome rate , outcomes ICU day , total hospital day , mortality . All adverse event monitor data safety monitor board . Currently plan pilot study future multi-center study plan base result pilot . These study help determine high-dose vitamin C safe adjunct acute fluid resuscitation severely burn patient .</detailed_description>
