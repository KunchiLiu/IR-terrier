	<brief_summary>The study describe protocol perform within framework PROTECT ( Pharmacoepidemiological Research Outcomes Therapeutics European ConsorTium ) Workpackage 2 Workgroup 1 . Primary aim study develop , test disseminate methodological standard design , conduct analysis Pharmacoepidemiological ( PE ) study applicable different safety issue use different data source . To achieve , result PE study five key adverse event ( AEs ) perform different database evaluate . Therefore , emphasis methodological aspect study protocol clinical consequence association investigation . Fracture proximal end femur hip associate considerable morbidity mortality . Hip/femur fracture impair quality life impose considerable economic burden , occur 20 % mortality rate within first year . Antidepressants ( AD ) , mainly tricyclic AD ( TCAs ) selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) associate fracture several study . A review 13 observational study show risk ratio range 1.2 3.7 current TCA user wide range 1.5 8.6 SSRI user . The majority study aforementioned review report increased risk fracture general SSRIs use mixed risk outcome TCA use . Several mechanism underlie adverse effect postulate literature : e.g . decrease bone mineral density ( BMD ) block serotonin transporter activity ( 5-hydroxytryptamine re-uptake ) hence affect bone metabolism structure simply fall co-morbidities depression . Previous observational study differ design , conduct analysis consider association vary degree accounting confounders . Confounding factor depression co-morbidities , previous fracture , concomitant drug use lifestyle factor smoke usually account study . In addition , small sample size , different method use ascertain exposure , selection bias lack data compliance well important covariates limit use result benefit-risk analysis . Furthermore , study evaluate different type SSRI TCA dose-response relationship AD remain studied . We study effect cumulative exposure focus acute ( le 6 month ) long term exposure ( least 5 year ) dose exposure . The objective study ass association AD use hip/femur fracture use different study design ( descriptive , cohort , nest case-control case crossover ) across different database compare result across database design . This evaluate impact design/database /population difference outcome study association . Data collect follow database : The Health Improvement Network [ ( THIN ] ) , UK-based primary care electronic medical record database , Dutch Mondriaan project ( primarily general physician base database linkage survey data Netherlands ) , Base de Datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atencion Primaria [ ( BIFAP ] ( Spanish primary care database ) ) , Bavarian statutory health insurance physician ' association database ( German health insurance database primary secondary care ) .</brief_summary>
