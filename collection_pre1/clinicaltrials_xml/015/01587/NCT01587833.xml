	<brief_summary>The study describe protocol perform within framework PROTECT ( Pharmacoepidemiological Research Outcomes Therapeutics European ConsorTium ) Workpackage 2 Workgroup 1 . Primary aim study develop , test disseminate methodological standard design , conduct analysis Pharmacoepidemiological ( PE ) study applicable different safety issue use different data source . To achieve , result PE study five key adverse event ( AEs ) perform different database evaluate . Therefore , emphasis methodological aspect study protocol clinical consequence association investigation . Benzodiazepines ( BZDs ) one therapeutic group widely use , mainly indicate hypnotic anxiolytic . Guidelines recommend treatment course exceed 4-6 week . However , long-term treatment highly prevalent , particularly old people prevalence range 15 30 % . However , treatment often take need . Hip/femur fracture major cause morbidity mortality , impair quality life impose considerable economic burden . Among people age 50 year old , case-fatality rate 20 % associate within first year . The relationship benzodiazepines hip fracture remain controversial . Psychotropic medication traditionally associate hip fracture . Among psychotropic medication , long elimination half-life benzodiazepine find increase risk hip fracture case-control study publish late eighty . Since , several investigation perform , mostly old patient focus relationship benzodiazepine hip fracture , benzodiazepine fall mechanism underlie effect . A review performed 2003 , include 11 epidemiological study , report result always consistent . Seven eight cohort population base case-control study , find association , different result report accord benzodiazepine ' half-life . In four hospital-based case-control study association benzodiazepine use hip fracture describe . Data dosing include three study , result conclusive . Results range effect increase risk high dose regimen . Results subsequent succeed study also show contradiction , association report one study , association describe short-term use short half-life , high-potency benzodiazepine . Even though epidemiological evidence suggest use benzodiazepine increase risk hip fracture , problem rise definition benzodiazepine exposure , bias confound indication control confounders . These remain unresolved topic address future study . In present protocol , propose ass risk hip/femur fracture associate benzodiazepine use different study design different primary database , compare result order evaluate impact design population difference outcome study association . The objective study ass association benzodiazepine use hip/femur fracture different study design ( descriptive , cohort , nest case-control , case crossover self control case series ) across different primary care databases ( Bavarian , Mondriaan , National Databases ( Denmark ) , General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) , Base de Datos para la Investigaci√≥n Farmacoepidemiologica en Atencion Primaria ( BIFAP ) The Health Improvement Network ( THIN ) ) compare result database , across design evaluate impact design/database/population difference outcome study association .</brief_summary>
