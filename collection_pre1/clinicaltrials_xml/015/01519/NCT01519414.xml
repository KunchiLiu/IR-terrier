	<brief_title>Tivantinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) men minimally symptomatic asymptomatic metastatic , castrate-resistant , chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treat ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate 12 week men metastatic , castrate-resistant , chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treat ARQ 197 . II . To determine radiographic response rate 12 week base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion compute tomography ( CT ) scan stability bone lesion bone scan castrate-resistant , chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treat ARQ 197 . III . To determine proportion patient progression-free 12 week . IV . To assess safety tolerability patient treat ARQ 197 use National Institute Cancer ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 grading toxicity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate marker bone turnover . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression may crossover Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
