	<detailed_description>Diabetes one devastating diseases big impact public health . Taking fast decision vigorous action like one propose European project ( DE-PLAN ) adapt Spanish Catalan actual situation ( coordinate project FIS DE-PLAN-CAT respectively ) avert . We consider two-step strategy whose main objective primary prevention diabetes European population highest-risk . At first stage , non-invasive screen program evaluate risk diabetes mean validated questionnaire ( FINDRISK survey ) . It distribute random 2000 outpatient public health service Catalonia . It involve twenty primary care facility refer five different center research scientist ( executive committee ) coordinate head center ( coordinate committee ) organise ( manage committee ) accord European regulation ( central committee ) . One third subject expect present high-risk criterion . They choose one three possible intervention modify lifestyle ( informative approach , one-to-one group training ) . For last option , 6-hour training program carry four session last 1,5 hour . The trainer charge periodically stimulate participant motivation . The study go routine health care ass diabetes incidence accord economic estimation cost-effectiveness relation adopt measure involve health care policy prevention program . This project aim evidence already know efficacy type program apply effectiveness ( large population ) cost-effectiveness ( socio-economic term ) . Other objective 1 ) create one big database diabetes cardiovascular disease risk 2 ) contribute edition European manual type 2 diabetes prevention .</detailed_description>
