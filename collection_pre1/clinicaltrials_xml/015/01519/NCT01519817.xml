	<detailed_description>Background : - Vaccines base recombinant heat inactivate yeast show immunogenic well tolerated animal human . - Using computer-based differential display analysis tool conduct global comparison express sequence tag ( EST ) cluster Unigene database , gene encode transcription factor Brachyury identify highly represent tumor-derived library rarely observe normal tissue-derived library . By use reverse-transcription follow polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , investigator LTIB identify overexpression Brachyury gastrointestinal , bladder , kidney , ovary , uterus , testicular carcinoma . Similar study also find over-expression Brachyury mRNA cell line lung , colon prostate cancer , majority normal tissue test , exception expression testis , thyroid low level expression B cell pool multiple normal donor . - Brachyury member T-box family transcription factor , characterize highly conserve DNA-binding domain designate T-domain . Data indicate transcription factor Brachyury confers tumor cell mesenchymal phenotype , well migratory invasive ability enhance tumor cell progression . - A murine model MC38 cell engineer express human Brachyury gene demonstrate increase metastatic potential Brachyury over-expressing MC38 cell . - Brachyury specific T cell lyse human cancer cell express Brachyury MHC restrict manner . - GI-6301 ( Yeast-Brachyury vaccine ) test vitro mouse model . These study show Brachyury-specific T cell response decrease metastasis mouse treat vaccine . - An ongoing study Hepatitis B vaccine ( GS-4774 ) use yeast platform ( heat kill Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) indicate safety 80 YU dose ( 4 injection site 20 YU injection per site ) . Objectives : -The primary objective : - Determine safety tolerability escalate dos GI-6301 ( Yeast-Brachyury vaccine ) heat-killed yeast-based vaccine - Determine expand cohort significant change Brachyury specific T cell detectable post vaccine . Eligibility : - Adults histologically proven metastatic locally advanced solid tumor standard curative palliative measure longer effective . Efforts make , much possible , enroll patient tumor type know increased expression Brachyury ( lung , breast , ovarian , prostate , colorectal , pancreatic chordoma ) . - Adequate organ function define liver , kidney , hematologic laboratory test . - Patients acquire immune defect , systemic autoimmune disease , concurrent use steroid , pericardial mass &gt; 1 cm , chronic infection , concurrent tricyclic antidepressant therapy , allergy yeast yeast-based product exclude . Design : - This open label , phase I trial sequential dose escalation cohort patient ( 3-6 patient per dose cohort ) 3 dos GI-6301 ( Yeast-Brachyury vaccine ) . - GI-6301 ( Yeast-Brachyury vaccine ) administer subcutaneously 4 site biweekly 7 visit ( day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 , 85 ) , monthly patient meet off-study criterion ( patient study one year stable disease well ( PR , CR ) option receive vaccine every 3 month instead monthly ) . - All patient give dose level complete 28 day on-study without DLT enrollment begin next dose level expansion phase ( see statistical analysis section ) . - Expansion Phase : 10 additional patient enrol MTD dose level ( high dose level explored event true MTD reach ) , receive treatment regimen , assess immunologic response clinical response . - Amended dose escalation : 10 patient enrol additional dose level ( 80 YU per dose , 4 injection site 20 YU per site ) determine safety dose level . - Up 33 total patient may require complete enrollment study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants must meet follow criterion participation : Diagnosis : Patients must histologically confirm malignancy Laboratory Pathology , NCI , metastatic unresectable locally advanced malignant solid tumor . In case Chordoma , unresectable , locally recurrent , metastatic tumor acceptable enrollment , give represent incurable disease . Efforts make , much possible , enroll patient tumor type know increased expression Brachyury ( lung , breast , ovarian , prostate , colorectal , pancreatic , chordoma ) . Patients may disease measurable nonmeasurable evaluable disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 study entry ( Karnofsky great equal 70 ) Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use Yeast Brachyury vaccine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Prior Therapy : Completed disease progression least one prior line diseaseappropriate therapy metastatic disease , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Serum creatinine 1.5 time upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance 24h urine collection 60 mL/min . ALT AST 2.5 time upper limit normal . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal OR patient Gilbert ? syndrome , total bilirubin 3.0 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within16 day start therapy ) : Granulocyte count 1,500/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count 100,000/m ( 3 ) Patients must baseline pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air . Recovered completely ( Grade 1 baseline ) reversible toxicity associate recent therapy . Typically 3 4 week patient recently receive cytotoxic therapy , except nitrosoureas mitomycin C 6 week need recovery . There minimum 2 week prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation . Prior immune therapy allow . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use effective birth control abstinence period 4 month last vaccination therapy . Patients prostate cancer must continue receive GnRH agonist therapy ( unless orchiectomy do ) . If patient refuse GnRH therapy , may enrol dose level safety already determine . Patients ER+ breast cancer treat adjuvant hormonal therapy ( selective estrogen receptor modulator aromatase inhibitor ) rise tumor marker evidence disease progression metastatic disease scan may continue hormonal therapy treat vaccine . Patients must negative yeast allergy skin test Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow eligible participation study : Patients evidence immune dysfunction list . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity due potential decrease immune response vaccine . Active autoimmune disease require treatment history autoimmune disease might stimulate vaccine treatment . This requirement due potential risk exacerbate autoimmunity . However , patient vitiligo , diabetes mellitus , hashimoto thyroiditis appropriate replacement therapy may enrol . Concurrent use systemic steroid , except physiologic dos systemic steroid replacement local ( topical , nasal , inhale ) steroid use . Limited dos systemic steroid ( e.g. , patient exacerbation reactive airway disease prevent IV contrast allergic reaction anaphylaxis patient know contrast allergy ) allow . History allergy untoward reaction yeastbased product ( hypersensitivity yeastbased product exclude ) . Pregnant breastfeed woman , due unknown effect Yeast Brachyury vaccine fetus infant . Serious intercurrent medical illness would interfere ability patient carry treatment program , include , limited , inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , active diverticulitis . Untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) spinal cord metastasis . Patients pericardial mass &gt; 1 cm exclude . Concurrent chemotherapy . ( However , follow antitumor therapy allow : Trastuzumab HER2+ breast cancer hormonal therapy breast ( e.g. , selective estrogen receptor modulators , aromatase inhibitor ) prostate cancer ( e.g. , GnRH antagonists/agonists antagonist androgen receptor antagonist ) . Chronic hepatitis infection , include B C , potential immune impairment cause disorder may diminish effectiveness immunologic therapy . Patients require continuous tricyclic antidepressant therapy exclude due interference yeast skin test create false negative test result . Participation another interventional clinical trial within 28 day start study treatment . Any significant disease , opinion investigator , may impair patient tolerance study treatment . Significant dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent .</criteria>
