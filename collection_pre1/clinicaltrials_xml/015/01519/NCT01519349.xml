	<brief_summary>The investigator perform gene therapy clinical trial Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) sporadic inclusion body myositis ( sIBM ) patient . Both condition important common feature : loss ability walk weakness thigh muscle . The investigator plan gene therapy trial deliver gene muscle call follistatin ( FS344 ) build muscle size strength . If successful , investigator increase size thigh muscle potentially prolong patient 's ability walk . The gene carry muscle virus call adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) . This virus occur naturally muscle cause human disease , set stage safe use clinical trial . Presently treatment reverse Becker muscular dystrophy sporadic inclusion body myositis . Only supportive care currently possible . In study , subject either diseases shot follistatin gene inject directly thigh muscle one ( first cohort ) leg ( 2nd 3rd cohort ) . One hundred eighty day follow gene delivery , muscle undergo biopsy look closely muscle see muscle fiber big . Between time gene transfer muscle biopsy , patient carefully monitor side effect treatment . This include MRI thigh muscle treatment day 180 follow treatment . Blood urine test , well physical examination do subject screen visit day 0 , 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 make sure side effect gene injection . Sutures remove 2 week post-biopsy . Additional blood sample collect 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Patients see end 1st 2nd year physical exam , assessment muscle strength appropriate blood test .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subject [ sIBM BMD must ambulatory identifiable atrophy quadriceps muscle muscle weakness ≥2 standard deviation predict use quantitative muscle test ( maximum voluntary isometric strength test ) , difficulty get chair , climb stair , get floor . sIBM patient include male postmenopause female ethnic racial group . Diagnosis sIBM base previously publish criterion include distribution weakness ( knee extensor weakness , finger flexor weakness ) histological presence inflammation vacuolar myopathy . Patients inflammation , vacuolar change intracellular amyloid deposit 15/18nm filament fulfill criterion irrespective clinical feature . BMD patient include adult male ( &gt; 18yo ) ethnic racial group prove mutation dystrophin gene continue ambulation age 15 year old . Ability cooperate muscle test Deficit muscle strength great 2 standard deviation age expectation Willingness sexually active subject reproductive capacity ( male population ) practice reliable method contraception two negative sperm sample obtain post gene transfer Active viral infection History evidence active infection hepatitis C , hepatitis A B , HIV Patients cause muscle weakness base medical history screen physical exam include : myopathy ( dystrophy , polymyositis , dermatomyositis ) , neuropathy ( cause ) , myasthenia gravis , weakness relate degenerative joint disease spine . Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy immunosuppressive therapy within 3 month start trial ( e.g . corticosteroid , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , intravenous immunoglobulin , rituximab ) Concomitant illness requirement chronic drug treatment opinion PI create unnecessary risk gene transfer . Patients take follow drug exclude : drug treatment myopathy neuropathy agent use treat diabetes mellitus Knee ankle contracture prevent proper muscle strength test Patients AAV1 neutralize antibody titer ≥ 1:1600 determined ELISA immunoassay Patients history angina patient past history myocardial infarction past 6 month</criteria>
