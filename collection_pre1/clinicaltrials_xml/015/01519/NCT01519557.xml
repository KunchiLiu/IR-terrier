	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia ( SCZ ) manifest positive symptom , negative symptom cognitive disturbance . To date , available medication treat schizophrenia bind primarily dopamine-2 ( D2 ) receptor brain , effective treat positive symptom schizophrenia . This unfortunate give negative cognitive symptom account disability schizophrenia . Emerging research past several decade suggest potential role dopamine-1 ( D1 ) receptor schizophrenia , well role D1 receptor stimulation improve cognitive deficit . DAR-0100A new medication bind selectively D1 receptor . It find safe give individual schizophrenia , preliminary data suggests may able help cognitive deficit . The investigator propose recruit individual schizophrenia symptomatically stable already take medication participate study . The investigator recruit 90 individual schizophrenia randomize low high dos DAR-0100A , well placebo . Patients stay hospital several week receive 10 dos DAR-0100A . The investigator also test cognition receive DAR-0100A see DAR-0100A helpful perform MRI scan take medication see area brain activate DAR-0100A administer .
