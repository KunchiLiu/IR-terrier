	<brief_title>A Study Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy AFN-12520000 Treatment Acute Bacterial Skin Skin Structure Infections Due Staphylococci</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label Phase 2 study design proof-of-concept study evaluate efficacy total daily dose 400 mg AFN-12520000 use number newly define early endpoint , conventional endpoint , composite endpoint determine clinical response . Safety tolerability also evaluate conventional endpoint . The study enroll 100 patient clinically document diagnosis Acute Bacterial Skin Skin Structure Infections ( ABSSSI ) due staphylococci . Patients meet eligibility criterion identify evaluated hospital specialize clinic . After consent obtain , first dose study medication administer . Daily clinical assessment conduct hospital and/or outpatient clinic first 5 day treatment . Adverse event ( AEs ) response therapy also assess . The study consist screening period , include baseline visit ; treatment period , end-of-treatment ( EOT ) visit ; follow-up period , include short-term ( Test-of-Cure [ TOC ] ) follow-up ( STFU/TOC ) visit long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) visit . Treatment regimens short 5 day ( 10 dos ) long 14 day ( 28 dos ) permit depend individual response treatment . The anticipated time commitment patient participation study approximately 20 42 day screening/baseline LTFU visit . The total duration study &lt; 12 month .</detailed_description>
