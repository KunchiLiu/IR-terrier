	<brief_title>Symptom-Adapted Physical Activity Intervention Minimizing Physical Function Decline Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility conduct symptom-adapted , randomized behavioral intervention design improve physical function older adult receive chemotherapy AML . II . To estimate effect size physical activity intervention change objective measure physical function , SPPB ( short physical performance battery ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate effect physical activity intervention self-reported physical function , health-related quality life , symptom ( depression , distress , fatigue ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients participate orientation session introduce exercise program protocol , review fundamental principle , demonstrate activity . Patients also receive educational material facilitate orientation adherence . Patients offer 20-50 minute standard , intermediate , and/or low intensity physical activity session 5 day week 4 week . Patients also receive lifestyle-related counseling 20-30 minute weekly . ARM II : Patients undergo usual care 4 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every two week two month monthly week 24 .</detailed_description>
