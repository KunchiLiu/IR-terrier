	<brief_title>WalkMore Walking Interventions Overweight/Obese Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline assessment , three month intervention control condition , follow another assessment end study . Participants screen blood pressure , height , weight , distance around waist . Participants meet eligibility criterion give pedometer log step one week . During visit 2 , participant return pedometer , able self-monitor appropriately , give accelerometer wear one week . Pedometry : Participants wear small device measure amount step accumulate 7 day first week run-in period follow-up ( Control group perform follow-up pedometry ) . Accelerometry : Participants ask wear small device similar pedometer attach belt hip measure physical activity level 7 day second week run-in period week prior follow-up . Assessment Visits ( Baseline 3 Months ) : Blood pressure , brachial ultrasound ( measure health artery ) , blood draw ( fast blood glucose insulin ) , height , body weight , waist measurement measure begin main study 3-month period . Brachial Artery Ultrasound : An ultrasound procedure use sound wave create picture . The brachial artery ultrasound measure elastic artery thickness line major blood vessel upper arm ( brachial artery ) . After rest fifteen minute , ultrasound probe place brachial artery elbow area non-dominant arm . A blood pressure cuff inflate around forearm five minute reduce blood flow . When cuff deflate , ultrasound continue five minute observe blood flow back arm . Blood Draw : A fast blood draw occur obtain fast glucose insulin . Walking Gait : Participants walk across 16 foot computerized floor mat , measure walk speed . After couple practice walk , participant ask walk 2 time across mat 6 different self-selected pace : slow , slow , preferred/normal , fast , fast , quickly possible ( without run ) . The participant able rest need . The computerized mat measure walk speed element associated pace participant walk .</detailed_description>
