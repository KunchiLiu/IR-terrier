	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The main goal project ass whether dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would alleviate burden carbohydrate counting patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) without significant degradation post-meal glucose control . Each patient admit twice clinical research facility . In one visit , patient eat morning meal accompany matching insulin bolus ( depend carbohydrate content meal ) glucose level subsequently regulate use dual-hormone closed-loop system . In visit , patient eat meal inject partial insulin bolus ( depend carbohydrate content meal ) remain need insulin deliver base glucose sensor excursion part closed-loop operation . If post-meal glucose level indifferent two visit , would suggest carbohydrate counting may necessary closed-loop operation closed-loop system give remain insulin need cover glucose absorbed meal . Twelve subject enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males female ≥ 18 ≤ 65 year old . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment medical history ( e.g . history acidoketosis , etc . ) ; C peptide level antibody determination need . The subject insulin pump therapy least 3 month . Last ( less 3 month ) HbA1c ≤ 12 % . Clinically significant nephropathy , neuropathy ( especially clinically significant gastroparesis ) retinopathy judge investigator . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) acute macrovascular event e.g . acute coronary syndrome cardiac surgery . Pregnancy . Severe hypoglycemic episode within two week screen . • Medication likely affect interpretation result : Prandase , Victoza , Byetta Symlin Known suspect allergy trial product meal content . Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete trial judgment investigator . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing eat snack , willing change pump parameter , etc ) . Unreliable carbohydrate counting Problems venous access</criteria>
