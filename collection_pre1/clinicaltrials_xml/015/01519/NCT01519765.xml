	<brief_summary>Approximately 22 % term pregnancy induce . Misoprostol , prostaglandin E1 analogue , widely accept induction agent , proven safe effective induction labor . It stimulate cervical ripen uterine contraction , thus make ideal induction agent unfavorable cervix . Research examine pharmacokinetics different administration route effect uterine contractility , side effect , safety . Vaginal misoprostol show superior oral administration however patient often prefer tolerable route . Buccal administration already show effective vaginal misoprostol cervical ripen induction first trim second trimester abortion . There minimal research compare buccal versus vaginal third trimester induction labor . The investigator study prospective , double blind , randomize control trial compare vaginal misoprostol buccal misoprostol equal dosages 25 mcg . The investigator seek answer question whether buccal misoprostol effective vaginal misoprostol third trimester induction labor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buccal Versus Vaginal Misoprostol Third Trimester Induction Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design Overview This prospective , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial compare buccal versus vaginal misoprostol equal dos ( 25 mcg every 4 hour ) . Each participant receive one buccal one vaginal tablet , one containing misoprostol . The administration repeat every four hour contraction inadequate ( frequency le every 5 minute ) cervix favorable , spontaneous rupture membrane occurs , patient active labor . Patient continue intermittent fetal heart monitor 1 hour administration . Prior discharge woman study ask complete questionnaire preference route administration side effect . 1 . Recruitment , Consenting , Confirming Eligibility : Women obstetric , medical , psychosocial indication induction labor University California , Los Angeles Ronald Reagan Medical Center evaluate participation . Those meet eligibility criterion invite participate . The subject counsel study , interested , undergo consent process . Each potential subject receive thorough overview study protocol review consent form study staff . All question answer . The subject advise decision participate study affect quality availability medical service receive hospital . She also advise stop participate study time , reason , impact service receive . If subject elect participate , two copy consent sign subject research staff . A signed consent , along copy Experimental Subjects Bill Rights , give subject . The consent file lock file cabinet . A general medical gynecological history physical do standard care . Routine obstetric lab medically indicate labs sent standard care . Patients undergo non-stress test uterine contraction monitoring prior induction labor . Obstetrical ultrasound review perform indicated per physician . Assessment cervix Bishop score , pelvis , fetal size , presentation perform . An unfavorable cervix define Bishop score 6 less ( ACOG ) . Women rupture membrane able participate . Gestational age determine basis last menstrual period , confirm early ultrasound , correct estimate date confinement early ultrasound . 2 . Misoprostol Administration/ Evaluation : The subject randomize either two group . Each participant receive vaginal buccal tablet , one tablet contain misoprostol . Subjects instructed nurse regard buccal placement swallow residue remain 20 minute . Intravaginal administration pill perform resident Physician midwife . The subject remain recumbent least 30 minute . The subject undergo fetal heart rate ( FHR ) uterine contraction monitoring least 1 hour misoprostol administration . The subject may undergo FHR uterine contraction monitoring per physician discretion . If subject adequate uterine contraction ( uterine contraction occur least every 5 minute ) , dosage route administration regimen repeat 6 maximum dosage ( maximum 150mcg ) . Cervical assessment Bishop score perform treatment vaginal administration . Treatment continue spontaneous rupture membrane , active labor , favorable cervix ( Bishop &gt; 6 ) . Augmentation labor use pitocin may start 4 hour last misoprostol dose accord routine protocol . Amniotomy may perform discretion manage obstetrician . If labor achieve receive 150mcg misoprostol , categorize fail induction . At time , subject may offer oxytocin induction , foley bulb mechanical dilation , cesarean section , accord fetal participant condition . Terbutaline 0.25mg subcutaneous may give tachysystole ( 5 uterine contraction 10 minute ) FHR change FHR category II-III change ( minimal variability , prolonged deceleration , repetitive variable , sinusoidal pattern , repetitive late deceleration ) responsive resuscitative measure ( oxygen supplementation , side positioning , intravenous fluid ) accord physician 's discretion . 3 . Follow : A short survey questionnaire assess gastrointestinal side effect , experience , preference route administration give prior discharge .</detailed_description>
