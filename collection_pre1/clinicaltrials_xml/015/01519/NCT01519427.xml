	<brief_title>Selumetinib Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma Who Failed Prior Therapy With Vemurafenib Dabrafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency objective clinical response RECIST 1.1 melanoma patient previously progress selective BRAF inhibitor treat MEK inhibitor , AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate plus Akt inhibitor , MK-2206 . II . To characterize toxicity regimens patient progress BRAF inhibitor therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . With required fresh pretreatment biopsy patient , plan characterize molecular state ( genetic proteomic ) associate BRAF inhibitor resistance . This may include analysis pathway activation , PI3/Akt MAP kinase pathway ; loss expression PTEN , secondary mutation BRAF , mutation MAP kinase pathway ( NRAS , KRAS , HRAS , CRAF , MEK ) , activation RTKs ( amplification , expression , phosphorylation ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO weekly . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
