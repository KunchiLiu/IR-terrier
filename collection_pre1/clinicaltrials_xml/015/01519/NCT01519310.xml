	<detailed_description>The purpose study see intestinal bacteria play role choline metabolism ( form choline monitor study call phosphatidylcholine , also know lecithin ) . This study help determine choline metabolism affect short-term antibiotic therapy , and/or alter probiotic therapy ( e.g . form eat yogurt ) . Metabolism process turn food eat fuel body . Choline nutrient find type fat commonly find food . There evidence choline metabolism bacteria intestine may link cardiac risk . The purpose study see intestinal bacteria play role choline metabolism ( form choline monitor study call phosphatidylcholine , also know lecithin ) . This study help determine choline metabolism affect short-term antibiotic therapy , and/or alter probiotic therapy ( e.g . form eat yogurt ) . This single center study randomize 30 normal , healthy volunteer 1 3 group : Group 1 : antibiotic 1 week , follow probiotic 3 week ; Group 2 : antibiotic 1 week , follow probiotic 3 week . Group 3 : antibiotic 1 week , follow probiotic 3 week . The antibiotic use metronidazole ( 500 mg twice daily ) ciprofloxacin ( 500 mg daily ) one week . The probiotic use one serve size standard flavor yogurt ( approximately 170 g ) twice daily three week . Study visit occur baseline , 1 week , 4 week . Blood urine sample collect start visit . Subjects eat 2 hard boil egg give standard medical isotope . Additional blood sample obtain 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 hour , urine sample collect 6 hour . Samples analyze choline level , byproduct , isotope level .</detailed_description>
