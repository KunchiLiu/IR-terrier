	<brief_summary>Depletion iron store frequently observe regular blood donor , effect iron deficiency general health well study . Recent study woman suffer fatigue suggest iron deficiency without concomitant anemia common cause complaint . Provided true healthy subject , substitution intravenous iron might result improvement general well iron deplete blood donor . Healthy regular blood donor screen low storage iron . Qualifying subject invite participate randomize , placebo-controlled trial substitution intravenous iron placebo ( saline solution ) . Differences subjectively felt fatigue factor general health well assess . If improvement factor show iron replacement , relevant concern artificially lower iron store repeat phlebotomy arise change monitor substitution policy blood banking might discuss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Substitution Blood Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic iron deficiency cause anemia impairment physical mental capacity . Since iron play essential role many enzyme apart oxygen carriage , iron deficiency propose independent factor impair wellbeing also without anemia . Symptoms like fatigue , asthenia , physical weakness , mental impairment many others associate iron deficiency . Recent clinical trial iron substitution iron deficient woman suffer general fatigue support hypothesis , data still conflict debate . Low body iron store frequently observe blood donor . Repeated phlebotomy may induce aggravate severe iron deficiency . Astonishingly , little know long term effect reduce iron store general health regular blood donor . Serious health impairment exclude conclusively . Since many symptom associate iron deficiency subtle , might miss otherwise healthy subject . Blood donor borderline decrease iron store ( i.e . serum ferritin 50 microg/l ) invite participate randomize , placebo-controlled intervention study compare intravenous iron carboxymaltose physiological saline solution ( placebo ) . Subjectively felt fatigue , measure numeric rating scale 1 10 major end point assess six month application study drug . As additional factor , various aspect general wellbeing assess use four psychometric questionnaire . Statistical analysis compare result application study drug result two study arm . Objective 1 . Assessment severity iron deficiency large group blood donor . 2 . Demonstration improvement fatigue substitution iron compare placebo iron deficient blood donor 3 . Detection improve general wellbeing otherwise healthy blood donor substitution intravenous iron 4 . Assessment tolerability intravenous iron healthy blood donor Methods Randomized , placebo control interventional trial compare effect intravenous iron placebo fatigue various factor general wellbeing . Endpoints assess numeric rating scale 1 10 four psychometric questionnaire .</detailed_description>
