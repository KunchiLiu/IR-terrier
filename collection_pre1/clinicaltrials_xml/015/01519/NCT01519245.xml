	<brief_summary>The goal project determine whether use tranexamic acid , clot-promoting drug , apply topically heart coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) reduce post operative blood loss . The investigator ' hypothesis use tranexamic acid-containing cardiac bath prior chest closure result statistically significant reduction blood loss transfusion requirement patient undergo CABG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Application Tranexamic Acid Reduce Post-operative Bleeding Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding expect major surgery . In patient undergo CABG , risk bleeding increase need intra-operative anticoagulation , thin , patient blood . This anticoagulation necessary reduce risk thrombosis potentially precipitate cardiopulmonary bypass machine , pump blood throughout body surgeon operate heart . Strategies currently use operating room minimize blood loss need allogenic blood transfusion cardiac surgery . These strategy include use intravenous antifibrinolytic agent , intra-operative red blood cell salvage device , topical fibrin sealant . Although risk infection blood transfusion small modern method blood screening , risk develop transfusion reaction possible predictable . Therefore , preferred avoid administer blood transfusion unless absolutely necessary . The use topical antifibrinolytic agent explore reduce blood loss cardiac surgery . Several trial publish literature since 1993 evaluate efficacy various antifibrinolytic medication apply topically , cardiac bath , prior chest closure CABG patient reduce post-operative blood loss potential need blood transfusion . The applicability methodology utilized study , however , limited context current Canadian practice cardiac surgery . Considerable difference perioperative strategy trial see , comparison current North American practice cardiac surgery . These trial also compare use topically apply antifibrinolytic agent , include lysine analogue tranexamic acid , control absence intravenous antifibrinolytic agent . The use intravenous lysine analogue reduce peri-operative bleeding become near-standard care CABG patient . Currently , available antifibrinolytic agent Canada lysine analogue tranexamic acid . This drug widely use administer intravenous preparation cardiac surgery safety profile reduction blood loss frequency blood transfusion . There presently publish randomize control trial evaluate blood loss CABG patient receive intravenous tranexamic acid , plus topical tranexamic acid placebo .</detailed_description>
