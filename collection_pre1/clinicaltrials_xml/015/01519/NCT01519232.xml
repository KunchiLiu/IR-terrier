	<brief_summary>Radiation-induced liver disease ( RILD ) syndrome characterize development anicteric ascites approximately 2 week 4 month hepatic irradiation . Previous study show volume liver irradiate dose radiation deliver prominent factor development RILD . While use population-based normal tissue complication probability model allow investigator limit risk RILD clinically acceptable level , test permit investigator determine individual 's risk RILD course treatment may allow individualized treatment modification , either prevent toxicity increase efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early , subclinical physiologic change liver may associate future development RILD . There currently limit data local change hepatic function associate regional radiation dose , change hepatic function radiation therapy ( RT ) associate RILD . In present study , radiological methodology minimally invasive use measure volumetric hepatic function patient intrahepatic malignancy , , course fraction radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
