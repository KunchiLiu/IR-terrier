	<brief_summary>Background : Early physical therapy ( PT ) intervention emphasis spinal stabilization show benefit individual undergo lumbar spinal surgery . Further , train cervical spine stabilizer ( deep cervical flexor cervical multifidus ) show effective reduce neck pain , restore cervical spinal function mobility many type cervical spine dysfunction . However , train stabilizer study individual undergo cervical spinal surgery , even though individual often problem residual pain weakness surgery . Purpose : The purpose study compare effectiveness clinical outcome early PT intervention usual care patient undergone anterior cervical spine fusion ( ACF ) surgery . A study hypothesis outcomes improve early PT intervention . Methods : This study double-blinded randomized clinical trial two-factor ( 2x3 ) research design . The patient follow ACF surgery randomly assign one two treatment group : usual care early intervention . Three outcome measure collect pre-operative baseline , 6-week 12-week post-operative follow-up visit , include : ( 1 ) deep cervical flexor ( DCF ) strength determine cranio-cervical flexion ( CCF ) performance test , ( 2 ) patient 's perceived disability associate neck pain determine Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) questionnaire , ( 3 ) neck pain level use numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) . In addition , 6 12 week , global rate change ( GROC ) scale obtain determine patient 's perception overall improvement result surgery . The investigator perform outcome measure blind group assignment , therefore participate treatment . After randomization , usual care group receive one visit PT post-operative instruction . The early intervention group receive verbal write instruction posture train cervical spine stabilizer addition usual care . The early intervention group also ask perform exercise home keep log exercise . Data Analysis : Two 2x3 MANOVAs repeat measure use examine difference CCF strength NDI score group three different time frame Î± level set 0.05 . Non-parametric test ( Mann-Whitney U test ) use compare difference NPRS GROC data time group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Enrollment A research assistant enroll participant , obtain informed consent , randomly assign participant two group . Therefore , research assistant blind group assignment . The primary investigator ( PI ) perform clinical test , blind group assignment , therefore perform PT intervention . Three license PTs train usual care early PT intervention . The research assistant inform PT assign study participant group assignment provide material treatment . Clinical Examination All participant undergo neurological examination cervical spine , include light touch sensory testing , muscle testing , deep tendon reflex testing , neural tension test upper extremity order identify neurologic deficit . These clinical test perform pre-operatively 6 12 week post-operatively . During post-operative visit , operative report post-operative radiograph also collect identify complication surgery may affect study result , use determine outcome measure . Clinical Outcome Measurements Instruments 1 . Cranio-cervical Flexor Strength ( CCF-S ) Testing The CCF-S test use determine DCF strength use StabilizerTM Pressure Biofeedback ( Chattanooga Group , Inc , Chattanooga , TN ) ( see Appendix A ) . The investigator ask participant lie supine position knee flexed Stabilizer place neck support cervical spine occiput cervical-thoracic junction . The cuff inflate 20 mm Hg . support cervical spine without add anterior force vertebra . The investigator instruct participant slight nod movement , chin-tuck , produce enough additional pressure cuff increase pressure 22 mmHg . The participant ask hold pressure level 10 second . If able perform successfully , participant ask try increase pressure 24 mm Hg 10 sec. , successful , increase 26 mm . They proceed 2 mm increment maximum 30 mmHg . The high pressure participant able hold 10 second define CCF-S score . The participant perform CCF-S test twice well two trial use data analysis . The reliability validity test establish individual without neck pain symptom . 2 . Cranio-cervical Flexor Endurance ( CCF-E ) Testing The endurance test DCF perform ask participant hold pressure CCF-S test 10 second maximum 10 repetition . This test stop repetition participant fail hold target pressure Stabilizer . Only successful repetition count , number multiply ten CCF-E score . If participant observe use substitute motion activate superficial neck flexor , also stop . The CCF-E determine single trial study . 3 . Neck Pain Disability Index ( Appendix C ) The Neck Pain Disability Index ( NDI ) use determine patient 's perceived disability associate neck pain . The NDI commonly use scale 10 item assess level neck function . The NDI show reliable valid several study . 4 . Numeric Pain Rating Scale The Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) use determine patient 's pain level . The NPRS well know scale 0-10 use many medical setting patient rate level pain . 5 . Global Rating Change scale The Global Rating Change ( GROC ) scale use determine patient 's perception overall improvement . The GROC 15-point numerical scale -7 ( much bad ) 0 ( change ) +7 ( much good ) , patient rate amount change since surgery . This scale give participant two post-operative time frame . Intervention The three PTs administer physical therapy in-patient stay follow ACF , train standardize treatment protocol usual care early PT intervention . After participant randomly assign one two group , PTs receive packet material need assign group participant research assistant . 1 . Usual Care Group For participant usual care group , intervention closely follow current common practice first 6 week post-operatively patient ACF . These participant see hospital one two treat PTs discharge . The participant instruct Patient Information Sheet ACF . They also view DVD title `` First Six Weeks '' , summary general post spine surgery precaution . The treat PT address question video , evaluate participant proper position head neck , use fit cervical collar applicable , proper body mechanic , safety transfer gait . In patient instruction ACF , patient encourage pay attention good posture , work walk increase distance help fusion . However , give mean record track progress walk distance . 2 . Early Physical Therapy Intervention Group The participant early PT intervention group receive instruction usual care group . In addition , instructed series exercise refer `` Postural Neck Protection Training '' attention head position recruit cervical segmental stabilizer , i.e . DCF , postural muscle . They instruct control pain may occur exercise . Strategies pain control include head shoulder posture correction , position support entire spine lumbar support , ice application , deep breathing relaxation technique . The participant give specific instruction exercise activity home exercise log record daily practice exercise program time spend walk . Follow-up call participant conduct research assistant 2 4 week post surgery verify compliance program address question . Questions require help PT relay principle investigator ( PI ) without identify participant . All participant group also encourage call assistant question throughout study . Questions relay assistant PI , PI remain blinded group assignment . Reliability Testing Although CCF test reliability establish individual without neck pain , reliability establish individual undergone cervical spine surgery . Therefore , same-day reliability test first ten participant able complete CCF-S CCF-E test 6-week post-operative data collection . These individual perform CCF-S test twice , begin end test session allow rest . Therefore , CCF first outcome measure complete , follow clinical measure . For between-day reliability , participant live close proximity hospital measure brief return visit second time repeat CCF test .</detailed_description>
