	<detailed_description>AT Î±2-globulin produce primarily liver . It bind thrombin , well serine protease , factor IX , X , XI , XII , kallikrein , plasmin irreversibly , neutralizes activity . However , inhibition thrombin factor Xa AT physiologic clinical significance.1 AT deficiency may occur congenital acquire deficiency . Acquired deficiencies secondary increase AT consumption , loss AT intravascular compartment ( renal failure , nephrotic syndrome ) liver disease ( cirrhosis ) . A normal AT level 80 % 120 % activity 50 % consider clinically important base risk venous thrombosis patient congenital deficiency AT.2 However , risk thrombosis high congenital form acquire form AT deficiency.3 , 4 Unfortunately , abnormal coagulation test associate condition assay AT activity , diagnostic readily available . Acquired deficiency AT commonly encounter cardiac surgical patient . Anticoagulation heparin CPB depend AT inhibit clot heparin alone effect coagulation . Heparin catalyze AT inhibition thrombin 1000 fold bind lysine residue AT alter conformation . Thrombin actually attack AT , disable , process attache AT thrombin , form complex detect used ass thrombin formation activity . Thirty percent AT consume process AT level reduce temporarily . If AT level restore , condition may arise call heparin resistance . There less frequent cause heparin resistance besides AT deficiency platelet , fibrin , vascular surface plasma proteins.5 There universally accept definition heparin resistance . It broadly define failure specific heparin dose ( 300 - 400 u/kg ) prolong ACT beyond 400 - 480 second preparation initiation CPB . Because definition heparin resistance may differ accord heparin dose target ACT , incidence heparin resistance literature variable . A recent randomized prospective study analyze 2270 cardiac case , identify 3.7 % patient heparin resistant incidence report high 18 % - 30 % The incidence heparin resistance likely increase use heparin infusion prior cardiac surgery become prevalent .</detailed_description>
