	<brief_title>Clamped Unclamped Surgery Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare change renal function ( post-operative compare pre-operative ) patient undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy without control hypotension ( Arm A ) vs. undergo partial nephrectomy hilar clamping ( Arm B ) , measure change estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare change renal function ( post-operative compare pre-operative ) patient undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy without control hypotension ( Arm A ) vs. undergo partial nephrectomy hilar clamping ( Arm B ) , measure change MAG3 ( % function attribute affected kidney ) change serum creatinine . II . To evaluate safety unclamped procedure estimate difference complication rate patient undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy without control hypotension ( Arm A ) vs. patient undergo partial nephrectomy hilar clamping ( Arm B ) term intra-operative complication post-operative complication . III . To evaluate surgical effectiveness unclamped procedure estimate difference patient undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy without control hypotension ( Arm A ) vs. patient undergo partial nephrectomy hilar clamping ( Arm B ) term surgical margin status , estimate blood loss , transfusion rate ( intraoperative post-operative ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To record compare intrarenal blood flow resistive index measurement order determine relationship exist intraoperative finding postoperative renal function . II . To quantify amount acute kidney injury ( AKI ) compare difference patient undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy without control hypotension ( Arm A ) vs. patient undergo partial nephrectomy hilar clamping ( Arm B ) measure urinary serum biomarkers . III . To compare effect unclamped procedure ( Arm A ) clamp procedure ( Arm B ) patient baseline eGFR &lt; 60 , patient age &gt; = 75 ( exploratory subset analysis ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy . Some patient may undergo unclamped partial nephrectomy control hypotension . ARM B : Patients undergo clamp partial nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
