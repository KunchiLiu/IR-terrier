	<brief_summary>Background : - Formaldehyde many us industry medicine . However , exposure formaldehyde associate increase risk myeloid leukemia . There still question chemical reacts bone marrow increase cancer risk . Some small study look affect stem cell , find bone marrow . Researchers want develop much large study worker China . The study look different level formaldehyde exposure . It focus chemical affect blood cell bone marrow . Objectives : - To study effect formaldehyde exposure blood cell bone marrow . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 60 year age work select factory Guangdong Province , China . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also screen work history . Those exposed benzene , butadiene , styrene , radiation include . - Participants study base regular formaldehyde exposure level . One-third expose 1 part per million ( ppm ) chemical . One-third expose 0.3 1 ppm . A control group exposure formaldehyde know toxic chemical . - Participants provide blood cheek swab sample . They also answer question work habit . - To look chemical exposure level , participant wear small monitor work 3 different day . They may provide additional blood cell sample direct . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Blood Toxicity Workers Exposed Formaldehyde</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research industrial worker professional expose formaldehyde suggests occupational exposure important chemical associate increase risk myeloid leukemia . However , still uncertainty biologic plausibility association question regard ability formaldehyde , extremely reactive , directly indirectly cause toxicity bone marrow . There several relatively small study impact occupational formaldehyde exposure peripheral blood cell find evidence peripheral blood cell myeloid lineage ( i.e. , granulocyte , platelet ) significantly decrease exposed worker . We propose follow-up finding relatively large study population China . We study hematologic parameter 240 high expose worker ( &gt; 1 ppm ) , 240 worker expose low level formaldehyde ( 0.3 1 ppm ) , group 240 unexposed control frequency-matched exposed worker . This study make important contribution understand leukemogenic potential formaldehyde , important public health regulatory implication .</detailed_description>
