	<brief_summary>Since introduction favourable early result enhance recovery programme decade ago , program become increasingly popular follow major surgery . Many element programme base solid evidence derive publish trial . These programme optimize different factor reduce stress surgery aim improve patient outcome speed recovery surgery . Key factor prior surgery condition expectation optimize associated disease . Strategies operation include use short-acting anaesthetic ( sleep ) agent , maintenance normal temperature minimal access surgery ( keyhole surgery ) . Care surgery optimize appropriate analgesia ( pain killer ) , early mobilisation ( walk ) early feed . This combined approach reduces hospital stay 2-4 day . There also evidence improvement result implementation enhance recovery programme cause significant deterioration quality life transfer cost another component health care . The relative contribution single element enhance recovery programme remain uncertain . Good patient information give confidence improve overall outcome . No study examine impact video education recovery . The aim study explore use video information provision patient participate enhanced recovery programme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychological Preparation Colorectal Surgery : Impact Video Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIAL DESIGN : A randomised controlled trial impact video education prepare patient surgery within enhanced recovery programme . Patients recruit Leicester General Hospital include everyone undergoing colorectal ( bowel ) surgery . A standard protocol ( treatment regime ) place patient . The primary end-point ( main aim ) length hospital stay . Secondary end-points ( factor consider ) patient satisfaction score ( use SF-36 outcome patient ) allow investigation potential implication incorporate video education enhance recovery programme routine clinical practice . METHODS : All surgeon treat patient trial specialist interest colorectal ( bowel ) surgery . All patient undergo plan bowel surgery benign ( non-cancerous ) malignant ( cancerous ) disease eligible . Patients speak understand english interpreter . Ethics approval seek inform ( sign ) consent surgery trial obtain . The study group get video leaflet control group receive leaflet . Randomisation ( Division group ) do use table random number assign study participant group . The consultant registrars charge take care patient surgery aware group patient belong standard discharge criterion use ( Patients discharge normal observation normal blood result , free line hand tubes waterworks , fully mobile ( walk ) , able get bed unaided dress independently . Hospital stay record day time patient admit hospital . Social reason non-discharge delay set home help etc record group patient . The time passage flatus ( wind back passage ) bowel motion ( stool ) record patient . Episodes nausea vomit ( sickness ) also record complication 30 day surgery . All patient complete questionnaire ( SF-36 ) prior surgery 3 month surgery assess satisfaction return normal activity leisure activity work home etc . DETAILS OF THE ENHANCED RECOVERY PROGRAMME : Preoperative preparation ( Prior surgery ) All patient allow free fluid ( liquid ) high calorie ( energy ) drink 2 hour operation . Patients undergo right hemicolectomy ( right side bowel surgery ) receive bowel preparation ( bowel cleanse ) leave side surgery receive phosphate enema morning surgery . All patient receive antibiotic DVT ( blood clot ) prophylaxis . All patient baseline blood test . Anaesthesia ( During surgery ) A standardise anaesthetic ( sleep ) protocol ( treatment regime ) use patient . Normal temperature maintain throughout surgery operation carry small incision ( cut ) necessary complete procedure . No nasogastric tube ( stomach tube ) use . Postoperative pain analgesia ( Pain relief surgery ) Analgesia ( Pain relief ) provide group 48 hour via PCA ( patient control pain relief ) , epidural ( pain relief via injection back ) TAPP block ( pain relief via injection belly ) . Paracetamol administer concurrently NSAIDS ( non steroidal drug ) tramadol breakthrough pain morphine discontinue . Visual analogue ( facial expression ) pain score rest movement measure daily discharge . All analgesia ( pain relieve drug ) use surgery record include discharge medication . Diet Fluids : Oral fluid push immediately postoperatively ( surgery ) group . In addition , protein drink normal food encourage group day 1 . All line arm remove day 2 unless clinical reason maintain . Both group daily blood test . All patient chest physiotherapy ( exercise ) encourage mobilise ( walk ) day one help nurse physiotherapist .</detailed_description>
