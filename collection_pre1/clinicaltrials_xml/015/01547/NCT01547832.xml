	<brief_summary>Background : - Early-onset Parkinson 's disease ( EOPD ) likely cause gene mutation Parkinson 's disease develop old people . Studying mutation may help find therapies EOPD . Researchers want study mutation gene call PARK2 . These mutation prevent fat uptake cell may interfere normal brain function . Researchers want study fat cholesterol body look effect mutation body brain . Objectives : - To study connection genetic mutation EOPD . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 80 year age EOPD . - Individuals 18 80 year age family history Parkinson disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample also collect . - Participants follow test : - Blood sample tissue ( skin fat ) biopsies - Cell line development tissue sample study function PARK2 - DEXA scan measure body fat context use low dose x-ray - Glucose insulin tolerance test measure blood sugar level . - Treatment provide part protocol ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mutations Associated With Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority subject degenerative Parkinson Disease present around age 70 year . Other subject develop brain disease age 40 year . This early onset presentation likely direct genetic cause degenerative form disease . Our understanding genetic cause early onset Parkinson Disease may help u find therapy genetic degenerative illness . Our laboratory find one genetic mutation associate early onset Parkinson Disease , gene call PARK2 result impair uptake fat cell . This may detrimental effect brain , brain require fat make cholesterol send brain signal . A finding mouse lack PARK2 , resistant diet induce diabetes obesity fatty liver . These data suggests systemic brain effect low fat uptake may oppose , low fat uptake beneficial effect risk factor obesity diabetes increase risk brain disease . To begin test whether case subject PARK2 mutation propose test fat uptake glucose insulin sensitivity .</detailed_description>
