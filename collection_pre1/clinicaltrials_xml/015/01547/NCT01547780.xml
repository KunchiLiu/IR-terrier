	<brief_summary>Background : - People traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) often inflammation brain . A protein call translocator protein ( TSPO ) often present inflammation . Researchers want see radioactive chemical know [ 11C ] PBR28 use study TSPO inflammation brain people TBI . Objectives : - To test whether [ 11C ] PBR28 use study change brain traumatic brain injury . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age TBI brain scan show sign inflammation . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - All participant two brain scan outpatient visit . A magnetic resonance image scan study brain activity . A positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan use [ 11C ] PBR28 look sign TSPO brain inflammation . - Participants TBI two PET scan within 10 day head injury , PET scan around 90 day injury . They may also MRI scan another study . Tests think , memory , concentration use study effect injury inflammation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Brain damage follow traumatic injury ( TBI ) result direct ( eg , mechanical injury brain vasculature ) indirect mechanism ( eg , secondary mechanism inflammation ) . While CT MRI help visualize result inflammatory process brain instance , development cerebral edema neither method use document active inflammation . The translocator protein ( TSPO ) , highly express microglia reactive astrocyte , use biomarker positron emission tomography ( PET ) identify active inflammatory process . Recently , laboratory develop PBR28 , new PET ligand image TSPO high level specific bind . We successfully use PBR28 investigate number brain disorder epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , HIV infection minor cognitive motor disorder , detect neuroinflammation . The current protocol aim explore whether PBR28 PET image show change subject TBI show MRI abnormality acute phase also chronic phase TBI . Study population : The following three group study : TBI subject brain injury within approximately 3 month exhibit MRI abnormality consistent TBI enrol `` Evaluation , Pathogenesis , Outcome Subjects Suspected Traumatic Brain Injury '' ( 10-N-N122 , PI Latour ) , `` Evaluation Diagnosis Potential Research Subjects Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) , ( 11-N-0084 , PI : Lawrence Latour ) , CNRM protocols . N = 20 TBI subject brain injury approximately 5 month ago , enrol 11-N-0084 , meet criterion TBI establish CNRM . N = 20 Healthy age-matched volunteer . N = 20 . Design : This exploratory study determine whether PBR28 detect increase TSPO associated neuroinflammation scan subject show MRI abnormality acute phase . We also investigate whether PBR28 detects change chronic phase recently report use old ligand , PK 11195 . Two group TBI subject study depend availability relative time injury . To investigate change TSPO area MRI abnormality acute phase , one group TBI subject ( n = 20 ) study show TBI- related MRI abnormality . These participant four PBR28 PET scan ; one two PET scan within approximately 10 day head injury , third PET scan approximately three month injury , fourth scan approximately one year scan ~three month . To study change TSPO chronic phase , another group TBI subject enrol brain injury approximately 5 month within 5 year ago meet criterion TBI CNRM . This separate group include TBI subject recruit CNRM sometime injury . The participant chronic phase one PET one MRI scan . In addition MRI data , TBI subject , clinical information obtain 10-N-N122 ( acute phase ) 11-N-0084 ( acute chronic phase ) use evaluate utility PET data order well understand pathology TBI . Outcome Measures : In exploratory study investigate ability PBR28 PET detect increase TSPO , primary goal measure magnitude variance increase observe PBR28 bind area inflammation follow TBI . Those data may use design future study large sample size .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects TBI : Subjects TBI eligible participation research study must meet follow inclusion criterion . Depending time availability subject follow two group study . No subject enrol group 1 2 . Group 1 Acute/subacute phase ( n = 20 ) Diagnosis nonpenetrating TBI cause head injury within approximately 5 month . Ambulatory . Able provide self consent without legallyauthorized representative base assessment Decision Making Capacity ( DMC ) Human Subjects Protection Unit ( HSPU ) . Show abnormal MRI finding consistent TBI protocol 10NN122 image database CNRM Image Processing Core subject recruit CNRM Recruitment Core protocol 11N0084 another CNRM protocol allow referral study . Age 18 old . Group 2 Chronic phase ( n = 20 ) A head injury approximately 5 month 5 year ago . Enrolled CNRM Recruitment Core protocol 11N0084 another CNRM protocol allow referral studies.. Meet least one criterion Probable Definite TBI establish CNRM . Ambulatory . Able provide self consent without legallyauthorized representative base assessment Decision Making Capacity ( DMC ) Human Subjects Protection Unit ( HSPU ) . Age 18 old . Group 3 Healthy subject . Healthy without past present history brain disease . Age 18 old . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects TBI group 1 2 eligible participation research study follow condition exist : 1 . Present past history brain disease TBI . 2 . Subjects abnormal MRI finding suggest diagnosis TBI second lesion brain tumor addition change consistent TBI . 3 . Serious medical condition , make study procedure current study unsafe . Such serious medical condition include uncontrolled epilepsy multiple serious injury . The Medical Advisory Investigator protocol determine whether subject need exclude . 4 . Contraindication MRI scan include certain metal implant device : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear , otologic , ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( Nitroglycerine ) remove study , body piercing ( ) , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel metal imbed subject body ( war wound accident previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near subject eye ) . 5 . Conditions preclude entry scanner ( e.g . morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc. ) . 6 . In female subject , pregnancy breastfeeding . 7 . Exposure research relate radiation past year , combine study , would place subject allowable limit . HEALTHY SUBJECTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THIS RESEARCH IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS EXIST : 1 . Any past present history DSM Axis I disorder , exception substance abuse end 6 month prior enrollment . 2 . Contraindication MRI scan include certain metal implant device : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear , otologic , ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( Nitroglycerine ) remove study , body piercing ( ) , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel metal imbed subject body ( war wound accident previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near subject eye ) . 3 . Conditions preclude entry scanner ( e.g . morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc. ) . 4 . In female subject , pregnancy breastfeeding . 5 . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality , define laboratory value normal range require clinical workup and/or treatment . 6 . Exposure research relate radiation past year , combine study , would place subject allowable limit . 7 . Previously determine lowaffinity binder another study TSPO . 8 . Positive result urine drug screen enrollment . HIV positive subject consider healthy long he/she show neuological psychiatric symptom base history physical exam . Results HIV test TBI subject healthy control may help interpretation PET result . Statistical analysis : Analysis date/study outcome . Results urine drug screen history use drug abuse may also help interpretation PET result . In addition , inclusion TBI subject show positive urine drug screen may improve recruitment TBI subject .</criteria>
