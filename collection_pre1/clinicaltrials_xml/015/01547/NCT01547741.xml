	<criteria>The patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The tumor must unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma breast histologic examination . The breast cancer must Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative base current American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) /CAP Guideline Recommendations Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing Breast Cancer . If result situ hybridization test ( FISH , chromagen situ hybridization [ CISH ] , ) equivocal , patient eligible plan administer HER2targeted therapy . All follow stag criterion must meet accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) criterion : By pathologic evaluation , primary tumor must pT13 ; By pathologic evaluation , ipsilateral node must pN0 , pN1 ( pN1mi , pN1a , pN1b , pN1c ) , pN2a , pN3a , pN3b . If pN0 , least one follow criterion must meet : ER negative PgR negative ; Pathologic tumor size great 2.0 cm ; T1c ( pathologic tumor size great 1.0 cm less equal 2.0 cm ) ER positive ( PgR status may positive negative ) either grade 3 histology Oncotype DXÂ® Recurrence Score great equal 25 . Patients must undergo either total mastectomy breastconserving surgery ( lumpectomy ) . For patient undergo lumpectomy , margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) determine local pathologist . If pathologic examination demonstrate tumor line resection , additional operative procedure must perform obtain clear margin . If tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) , patient must undergo total mastectomy eligible . ( Patients margin positive lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible without additional resection . ) For patient undergo mastectomy , margin must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS . Patients must complete one follow procedure evaluation pathologic nodal status : Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone pathologic nodal stag base sentinel lymphadenectomy pN0 , pN1mi , pN1b ; Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone pathologic nodal stag base sentinel lymphadenectomy pN1a limit 1 2 positive node primary tumor T1 T2 pathologic evaluation ; Sentinel lymphadenectomy follow removal additional nonsentinel lymph node sentinel node ( SN ) positive ; Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure . The interval last surgery breast cancer ( treatment stag ) randomization must 84 day . Patients must ER analysis perform primary tumor prior randomization . Breast cancer must assess ER status current ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations hormone receptor test . If negative ER , assessment PgR must also perform accord current ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations hormone receptor test . ( Either core biopsy surgical resection specimen use ER/PgR test . ) The recent postoperative blood count , perform within 6 week prior randomization , must meet following criterion : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1200/mm3 ; platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin must great equal 10 g/dL . The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function must meet base result recent postoperative test perform within 6 week prior randomization : total bilirubin must less equal upper limit normal ( ULN ) lab unless patient bilirubin elevation great ULN 1.5 x ULN due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must less equal 2.5 x ULN lab ; aspartate transaminase ( AST ) must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . Alkaline phosphatase AST may great ULN . For example , alkaline phosphatase great ULN less equal 2.5 x ULN , AST must less equal ULN . If AST great ULN less equal 1.5 x ULN , alkaline phosphatase must less equal ULN . Note : If alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) perform instead AST ( per institution 's standard practice ) , ALT value must less equal 1.5 x ULN ; perform , AST must less equal 1.5 x ULN . Patients AST alkaline phosphatase great ULN eligible inclusion study liver image ( CT , MRI , PETCT , PET scan perform within 90 day prior randomization ) demonstrate metastatic disease requirement adequate hepatic function describe meet . Patients alkaline phosphatase great ULN less equal 2.5 x ULN eligible inclusion study bone scan , PETCT scan , PET scan perform within 90 day prior randomization demonstrate metastatic disease . The recent postoperative serum creatinine perform within 6 week prior randomization must less equal ULN lab . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assessment 2D echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan must perform within 90 day prior randomization . The LVEF must great equal 50 % regardless facility 's low limit normal ( LLN ) . ( If facility performing assessment report LVEF whole number , decimal report great equal 5 round decimal report less 5 rounded . ) Exclusion criterion : Patients one follow condition ineligible study . T4 tumor include inflammatory breast cancer . Definitive clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease . ( Chest image [ mandatory patient ] image [ require ] must perform within 90 day prior randomization . ) Synchronous previous contralateral invasive breast cancer . ( Patients synchronous and/or previous contralateral DCIS eligible . ) Any history ipsilateral invasive breast cancer ipsilateral DCIS . History nonbreast malignancy within 5 year prior randomization , except follow : carcinoma situ cervix , colorectal carcinoma situ , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Previous therapy anthracyclines taxanes malignancy . Chemotherapy administer currently diagnose breast cancer prior randomization . Continued endocrine therapy raloxifene tamoxifen ( SERM ) aromatase inhibitor . Patients eligible medication discontinue prior randomization . Any sex hormonal therapy , e.g. , birth control pill , ovarian hormone replacement therapy . Patients eligible medication discontinue prior randomization . Known active hepatitis B hepatitis C abnormal liver function test . Cardiac disease ( history and/or active disease ) would preclude use drug include treatment regimen . This include confine : Active cardiac disease angina pectoris require use antianginal medication ; ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction ; supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication ; conduction abnormality require pacemaker ; valvular disease document compromise cardiac function ; symptomatic pericarditis . History cardiac disease myocardial infarction document elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment leave ventricular function ; history document congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ; document cardiomyopathy . Whole breast radiation therapy ( RT ) prior randomization partial breast RT complete date randomization . Intrinsic lung disease result dyspnea . Unstable diabetes mellitus . Active infection chronic infection require suppressive antibiotic . History major organ allograft condition require chronic immunosuppression , e.g. , kidney , liver , lung , heart , bone marrow transplant , autoimmune disease . ( Patients receive corneal transplant , cadaver skin , bone transplant eligible . ) Nervous system disorder ( paresthesia , peripheral motor neuropathy , peripheral sensory neuropathy ) great equal grade 2 , per NCI CTCAE v4.0 . Conditions would prohibit administration corticosteroid . Chronic daily treatment corticosteroid ( dose great equal 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent ) ( exclude inhale steroid ) . History hypersensitivity reaction drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( Note : Pregnancy test must perform within 2 week prior randomization accord institutional standard woman childbearing potential . ) Other nonmalignant systemic disease would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require followup . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Use investigational product within 30 day prior randomization .</criteria>
