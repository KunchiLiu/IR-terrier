	<detailed_description>An insufficient donor supply worldwide problem organ transplantation . Even corneal transplantation , widely perform transplantation , shortage imbalance donor supply global concern . In National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) , investigator perform one hundred corneal transplantation every year majority donor cornea eye bank United States . Previous literature show satisfactory result corneal transplantation use foreign donor cornea compare domestic cornea . However long preservation time associate statistically significant increase risk persistence postoperative epithelial defect . On hand , long storage time may allow good outcome high-risk graft depletion donor T cell donor cornea storage medium . Currently , demographic surgical result compare different donor cornea source available Taiwan . NTUH , one large tertiary medical center northern Taiwan , charge big part intense care patient receive corneal transplantation . With detailed medical record do patient care ward out-patient clinic , investigator competence meaningful program .</detailed_description>
