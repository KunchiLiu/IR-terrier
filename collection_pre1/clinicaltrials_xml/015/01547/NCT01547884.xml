	<brief_summary>Background : - Lymphatic filariasis infection cause small , thread-like worm . It spread mosquito , cause fever , chill , headache . If untreated , also cause elephantiasis , condition lead swell arm , leg , breast , scrotum . Treatment eliminate worm blood reduce risk develop elephantiasis . Researchers want study people latent tuberculosis ( TB ) may may infect filariasis . This study look way people latent TB fight infection worm . Objectives : - To study immune system people latent TB react filarial infection . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age latent TB may may filarial infection . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood stool sample test infection . - Participants lymphatic filariasis another kind intestinal worm treat parasite . This last study visit . - Participants latent TB lymphatic filariasis treat standard treatment disease . They come back second visit 6 month later , provide another blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tissue-invasive helminth parasite infect close 500 million people worldwide associate strong T helper ( Th ) 2 response regulatory network downregulate potentially protective Th1 response . The two common tissue invasive helminth parasite Wuchereria bancrofti , cause lymphatic filariasis Strongyloides stercoralis , cause stronyloidiasis . Previous study show intestinal helminth coinfection accompany lowered vitro production interferon-gamma elevate production interleukin 10 individual active pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) . Our team recently show co-existent filarial TB infection down-regulate Th1 Th17 response , necessary protection active TB . The current study compare immune response mycobacterial antigen individual latent tuberculosis ( LTBI+ ) concomitant helminth infection ( Hel+ ) , include filarial ( Fil+ ) strongyloides ( STR+ ) infection versus LTBI+ without concomitant helminth infection ( Hel- ) . Immune responses mycobacterial antigen co-infected individual also evaluate treatment helminth infection . Individuals ( n=4000 ) sign screen consent prior undergo study procedure . Every participant medical history collect undergo physical exam tuberculin 2TU purify protein derivative ( PPD ) skin test ; woman childbearing potential also undergo urine pregnancy test , positive test result exclude study . Individuals positive PPD skin test result ( &gt; = 5 mm ) symptom active TB blood drawn ( 5 mL ) part screen procedure confirm LTBI+ status , evaluate circulate filarial antigenemia , determine Strongyloides status ELISA , measure hematocrit level , storage serum sample ; PPD skin test result less equal 5 mm exclude study . Individuals positive symptom TB also exclude study , sputum collect , positive smear refer treatment . Individuals match age , gender , geographic location , assign one two group , LTBI+ Hel+ ( n=100 ) LTBI+ Hel- ( n=100 ) . Within 3 month screen , individual ask sign on-study consent undergo second blood draw ( 10 mL ) immunological investigation storage serum sample ; woman childbearing potential undergo repeat urine pregnancy test , positive test result exclude study . Stool sample also collect microscopic evaluation ovum parasite . LTBI+ Fil+ individual treat single standard dose albendazole ( 400 mg ) single standard dose diethylcarbamazine citrate ( 300 mg ) , available National Programme Elimination Lymphatic Filariasis India . LTBI+ STR+ individual treat single standard dose ivermectin ( 12mg ) single standard dose albendazole ( 400mg ) . These individual ask return 6 month treatment undergo third blood draw ( 10 mL ) additional immunological investigation storage serum sample . LTBI+ Hel-individuals test positive intestinal helminth infection treat single standard dose albendazole ( 400 mg ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals ( 18 65 year age ) meet follow criterion eligible participate study : Positive tuberculin PPD skin test result ( &gt; equal 5 mm ) IGRA+ . Willingness provide blood stool sample examination . Willingness sample store study participant . PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals eligible participate : Pulmonary symptom suggestive TB ( cough &gt; 3 week duration and/or intermittent fever &gt; 1 week duration and/or hemoptysis ) . Tuberculin skin test within last 6 month prior screen . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Known documented case cancer , acquire immune deficiency syndrome , immunosuppressive illness . History illness condition , investigator judgment , may substantially increase risk associate subject participation protocol , may compromise scientific objective . Consumption DEC last one year prior screen . EXCLUSION OF PREGNANT WOMEN : Pregnancy : Pregnant lactate woman exclude study safety DEC ivermectin adequately evaluate pregnancy lactation , albendazole Category C drug find teratogenic animal , pose potential risk breastfeeding . EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN : Children ( &lt; 18 year age ) include study due fact prevalence filarial strongyloides infection child find low South India .</criteria>
