	<brief_title>Pre-therapeutic Identification Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Gene ( DPD ) Deficiency Predicting Toxicity Fluoropyrimidines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fluoropyrimidines , 5-Fluorouracil important , represent family medication use particular cancerology . They molecules widely use cancerology since find nearly 45 % chemotherapy protocols treatment 50 % cancer ( colorectum , oesophagus , stomach , breast , upper digestive respiratory tract ) . They use metastatic situation also adjuvant situation , word patient treat localised tumour , present risk relapse . A severe toxic risk tolerate condition , doctor assure maximum level safety patient . These medicine cause 3 % grade IV toxicity first second administration , 0.3 % death . To one add total 20 25 % grade III-IV toxic event . Anticancer treatment mostly administer body size best case basic biological examination haemogram renal status , without take consideration individual particularity , whether genetic epigenetic . Among potential toxicity risk factor one find individual metabolic difference link genetic modification metabolism enzymes well difference chemical receptor transporter . For fluoropyrimidines , polymorphism find dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene ( DPD ) , major catabolism enzyme . A deficit enzyme major counter-indication use medicine . Early determination DPD status would allow identification patient risk would thus help subsequent dose adjustment selection treatment modality .</detailed_description>
