	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Gemcitabine First-line Treatment Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer characterise aggressive growth , treatment resistance extremely poor prognosis . In subject locally advance metastatic disease , median survival approximately 6 - 11 month 2 - 6 month , respectively . The currently accept treatment disease EU gemcitabine supplant treatment 5-FU show median survival duration marginally improve ( 4.41 5.65 month respectively , p = 0,022 ) . The reported median survival time subject treat single-agent gemcitabine randomize phase III study range form 4.9 7.2 month . Despite improvement treatment pancreatic cancer , prognosis remain poor . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) belong proprietary class compound call immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) . IMiDshave immunomodulatory anti-angiogenic property could confer antitumour antimetastatic effect . Lenalidomide demonstrate possess anti-angiogenic activity inhibition bFGF , VEGF TNF-alpha induce endothelial cell migration , due least part inhibition Akt phosphorylation response bFGF.In addition , lenalidomide variety immunomodulatory effect . Gemcitabine ( Gemzar® ) synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue use standard treatment advance pancreatic cancer . Beside cytotoxic activity gemcitabine , accumulate evidence indicate product promote specific anticancer immune response contribute therapeutic effect conventional therapy.Down-regulation survival rate pancreatic cell line recently observe , treat lenalidomide gemcitabine sub-optimal concentrations.Those data support hypothesis potential hyper-additive affect treatment give combination . Therefore lenalidomide gemcitabine major interest explore combination therapy . This phase I/II open-label , multi-center study . It consist phase I dose-finding part phase II part subject treat MTD establish phase I. Lenalidomide administer stepwise dose-escalation schedule phase I part . Thus , primary endpoint phase I part determine MTD safety regimen lenalidomide gemcitabine first-line treatment subject advance pancreatic cancer.In phase II part , primary endpoint evaluate immunomodulatory effect lenalidomide combination gemcitabine patient population .</detailed_description>
