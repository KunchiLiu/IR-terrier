	<brief_summary>Statins report pleiotropic effect include antiinflammatory , anti-oxidative stress effect stabilise plaque condition . Some research indicate load dose statin reduce contrast induced nephropathy , level inflammatory marker significantly decrease . The investigator hypothesis load dose atorvastatin may attenuate inflammatory response cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) therefore reduce postoperative acute kidney injury cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury occur 30 % cardiac surgery influence patient ' mid-term long-term outcome . Furthermore , evidence show patient initiate renal placement therapy hospital high mortality morbility . The pathology Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury ( CSA-AKI ) clear yet , many research find cardiopulmonary bypass independent risk factor develop AKI , inflammatory burst cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) may play important role CSA-AKI . Statins report anti-inflammatory reaction many research . In Some multicenter RCTS , Statins report reduce myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation renoprotective effect due pleiotropic effect percutaneous coronary intervention . While cardiac surgery setting , renoprotective effect statin still controversial . The investigator believe difference surgery PCI may contribute discrepancy . The investigator plan test renoprotective effect atorvastatin randomize , double-blind control manner try explore mechanism protective effect . The investigator hypothesise load dose atorvastatin pretreatment elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery may attenuate inflammatory response CPB therefore reduce postoperative AKI help recovery AKI . The investigator randomize patient two arm , Atorvastatin group take Atorvastatin 80mg 12h surgery another 40mg 2h operation , control arm take placebo regime . The investigator plan compare inflammatory cytokine different time point incidence AKI two group . The investigator hope Atorvastatin group decrease AKI incidence low level inflammatory cytokine , 's , two good correlation time frame .</detailed_description>
