	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancer cancer treatment cause symptoms side effect . Pain , fatigue , emotional distress three common symptom . Accurate reporting symptom improve treatment method outcomes . Even though symptom report important treatment , method collect compare patient data multiple cancer care center . Researchers want develop method collect cancer patient symptom information multiple center . This method may help improve cancer treatment hospital care center . Objectives : - To collect patient-reported symptom information multiple cancer care center . Eligibility : - Individuals least 21 year age treat breast colon cancer past year . - Participants come one participate cancer care center . Design : - Participants answer short questionnaire symptom cancer treatment . Questions ask symptom severity experience . Other question ask well doctor nurse manage symptom . - Participant response compare medical personal information . This information may include cancer type , age diagnosis , type treatment . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Cancer treatment lead symptom side effect . Pain , fatigue , emotional distress three common distress symptom . Patient report gold standard assess symptom critical patient-centered care . - Symptoms often under-reported under-treated lead impairment quality life , function , treatment adherence . Factors contribute under-reporting/treatment occur within patient ( e.g. , fear addiction pain med ) , provider ( e.g. , lack train ) , healthcare system ( e.g. , under-insurance ) . - A limited number study suggest burden symptom fall unevenly certain racial/ethnic , socioeconomic status ( SES ) , insurance status group . - Despite importance symptom cancer care , method systematically collect patient report data institutional national level . Such system could identify risk group , inform intervention , ultimately improve quality care . - This study use exist resource design cost-effective symptom surveillance system . The NCI Community Cancer Center Program ( NCCCP ) provide infrastructure efficiently conduct multi-site pilot real-world set diverse sample patient . The Commission Cancer Rapid Quality Reporting System ( RQRS ) automate sample minimize burden cancer center staff , facilitate data collection soon treatment , protect patient personal identifier . The survey instrument base upon previously validate measure . Objectives : - To pilot method collect patient report symptom-related experience could use surveillance institutional , future , population level . - To investigate disparity symptom burden management racial/ethnic , SES , health insurance status group . - To pilot use patient-reported symptom data quality improvement symptom management participate cancer center . Eligibility : - Diagnosed Stage I-III breast colon cancer first primary cancer February 2011 January 2013 - Age 21 year old - Received cancer care one 17 participate NCCCP Cancer Centers . Design : - This cross-sectional survey collect report symptom related experience patient 3-12 month cancer diagnosis via mailed questionnaire . A methodological experiment randomize patient second mail compare telephone follow-up third mailing . Data cost Cancer Center staff time collect provide scalable estimate overall cost examine cost-effectiveness telephone follow-up . - The study provide prevalence estimate various symptom symptom management item . More complex , model-based statistic use investigate symptom disparity ( Aim 2 ) . For model , outcomes either continuous ( e.g. , pain severity ) ordinal ( e.g. , symptom management item ) analyze use Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMM ) take account two-level structure data ( patient nest within Cancer Centers ) . We expect enroll 2,550 patient .</detailed_description>
