	<detailed_description>The significant morbidity mortality associate acute kidney injury critical care patient cardiac surgery well-known . Studies demonstrate 1 30 % postoperative mortality even high rate 70 % patient develop renal failure require dialysis . Even small increase creatinine 0 0.5 mg/dl result great two-fold rise 30-day mortality.1 Despite effort improve outcome , proven effective pharmacological intervention treat acute kidney failure . Most recommendation aim prevention identify high-risk patient , avoid nephrotoxic drug minimize intraoperative hypotensive insults.2 There study examine maintenance adequate renal perfusion measure renal blood flow use transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) cardiopulmonary bypass.3 , 4 Yang et al . examine leave renal artery 60 patient use TEE cardiac surgery evaluate feasibility use TEE method measure renal blood flow intraoperatively.4 Although able include 60 % subject due technical difficulty , demonstrate le 10 % variability measurement therefore good reproducibility use TEE . However , renal blood flow may best method predict sufficient renal perfusion . Renal autoregulation preserve general anesthesia even maintenance adequate mean arterial blood pressure cardiac output . Renal blood flow worsen hemodilution hypothermia . In addition , due pulsatile nature , diameter renal artery vary cardiac cycle source calculation error determine renal blood flow function renal blood velocity arterial diameter.2 Renal resistive index ( RI ) measure intrarenal hemodynamics calculate use blood flow velocity segmental intrarenal vessel correlate renal blood flow renovascular resistance . The renal artery use flow varies inconsistent systole diastole . RI becomes elevate pathological condition associate increase creatinine , renal injury dysfunction.5-7 As blood flow creatinine clearance decrease renal vasculature , resistive index increase . Resistive index may better gauge renal dysfunction rather renal blood flow easy ass less dependent obtain Doppler beam view orient perfectly parallel blood flow.2 Because RI ratio renal blood flow velocity [ RI = ( peak systolic velocity - peak end diastolic velocity ) /peak systolic velocity ] , margin error create non-parallel Doppler beam cancel . Traditionally , resistive index obtain transabdominal Doppler ultrasonography ( USG ) although transesophageal study use RI secondary endpoint examine renal blood flow.2 , 4 There currently technique routinely uses TEE intraoperatively monitor resistive index determination adequate renal blood perfusion indication renal compromise.8 In addition , study report RI secondary outcome , study validate TEE calculation resistive index compare establish transabdominal doppler technique .</detailed_description>
