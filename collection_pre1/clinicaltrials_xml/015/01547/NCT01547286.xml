	<detailed_description>Asthma disease rapidly increase incidence already affect 17 million people United States alone . It major importance understand mechanism responsible underlying mechanical physiological change occur asthma exacerbation . The effect asthma pulmonary vasculature virtually unknown . It long know area severely reduce airflow occur asthma contribute significantly impairment gas exchange disease . However , extent local blood flow change asthmatic attack unclear . This proposal design evaluate relevance potential mechanism responsible blood flow defect see PET study subject asthma identify factor modify perfusion distribution . With knowledge , hop focus basic research motivate understand fundamental mechanism behind process ultimately target improved asthma therapy . Comparing measure healthy subject asthmatic patient may lead method improve patient care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Mild asthma define National Institutes Health 2002 guideline Diagnosis Management Asthma . Briefly , people mild asthma define symptom great 2 time week less per day normal FEV1 ( &gt; 80 % predict ) Clinical history allergic symptom cat dust mite allergen demonstrate skin reactivity Lifelong absence cigarette smoking ( define lifetime total less 5 packyears ) ; none 5 year Willing able give inform consent Expressed desire participate interview principal investigator Women childbearing potential document pregnant ( base serum betaHCG test ) nursing . The presence spontaneous asthmatic episode clinical evidence upper respiratory tract infection within previous 6 week . Participation research study involve drug biologic 30 day prior study . Intolerance albuterol , atropine , lidocaine . Antihistamines within 7 day screen visit . Known exposure agent associate pulmonary disease ( i.e . asbestos , silica ) . Presence known pulmonary disease , coronary disease , congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia , history cerebrovascular accident , renal failure ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 , know ) , history anaphylaxis , cirrhosis presence significant disease , opinion principal investigator , would pose significant risk subject confound result study . Use systemic steroid , increase use inhaled steroid , beta blocker MAO inhibitor visit asthma exacerbation within 1 month screen visit . A history asthmarelated respiratory failure require intubation . A history hospitalization asthma . Subjects high possibility poor compliance study judge principal investigator . History contrast dye allergy . Unresponsive bronchodilator agent . Quantitative skin prick test dilution level standardize cat allergen extract 1:2048 ( 4.88 BAU/ml ) subject challenged cat allergen . Quantitative skin prick test dilution level standardize mite allergen extract 1:2048 ( 4.88 BAU/ml ) subject challenge either mite allergen . Subjects , participate one study , cumulative radiation dose exceed maximum yearly recommend dose research subject ( 50 mSv ) . Previous participation one protocol proposal . Contraindication methacholine challenge test ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict &lt; 1L , heart attack stroke last 3 month , uncontrolled hypertension , know aortic aneurysm ) .
