	<brief_title>The Effect Bone Grafts Facial Gingival Profile Maxillary Anterior Single Tooth Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty subject least 18 year old fail upper front tooth seek implant treatment recruit Loma Linda University School Dentistry ( LLUSD ) , consent also take place . The subject randomly divide 3 group . The subject receive immediate implant placement provisionalization ( IIPP ) conjunction connective tissue graft ( CTG ) ( Group I ) without ( Group II ) bone graft extraction socket ; bone graft extraction socket facial aspect fail tooth ( Group III ) . Clinical , radiographic model assessment perform different time interval ( pre-treatment 12 month implant placement ) statistically analyze ( Î± = 0.05 ) evaluate peri-implant tissue response facial gingival profile implant . Complications , , also record appropriately address .</detailed_description>
