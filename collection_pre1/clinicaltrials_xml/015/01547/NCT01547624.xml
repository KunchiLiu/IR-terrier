	<brief_summary>Today evidence neck specific exercise reduce neck pain problem patient mechanical neck pain . However , lack consensus optimize neck exercise dosage neck rehabilitation . More knowledge need determine muscle activate exercise think neck-specific . There neither enough knowledge difference neck muscle activation patient long stand neck problem whiplash trauma healthy control neck muscle function improve specific neck exercise . One approach would real time study deformation deformation rate different layer neck muscle patient residual long-term neck pain disability whiplash trauma . The purpose present study investigate deformation deformation rate different layer dorsal ventral neck muscle ( include upper middle part trapezius muscle ) rest different exercise ; arm flexion 120 degree , repeat arm flexion 90 degree , low load neck extension , low load neck muscle endurance test , shoulder elevation . Forty patient long standing ( 6 month le 3 year ) patient 40 control match age gender include comparison patient healthy neck muscle activation . The investigator also include 60 patient whiplash trauma , 30 patient randomized A. neck specific exercise 3 month period B. 30 wait list 3 month . Measurements perform baseline 3 month follow-up . Those patient fulfil 3 month period neck specific exercise also ask 6 month follow-up .</brief_summary>
