	<brief_summary>This study intend evaluate new device use light measure amount oxygen muscle injure non-injured leg forearm specific situation . The name technology NIRS ( near-infrared spectroscopy ) . This prospective observational cohort study intend gather data use NIRS among injured noninjured extremity time . Additionally , data help establish diagnostic perfusion value threshold use subsequent interventional study confirm efficacy NIRS-based ACS monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Near Infrared Spectroscopy Diagnosis Acute Compartment Syndrome Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swelling build severely injured leg ( example , break leg ) . In 20 % bad injury , swell great act cut blood supply leg , strangulate inside . When occurs , call Acute Compartment Syndrome ( ACS ) . This painful bad situation , need diagnose surgically treat urgent fashion . Currently , standard way physician diagnose ACS clinical examination . By ask patient question , move inspect patient 's leg typically insert needle patient 's legs measure amount pressure leg . Physicians compile information make final diagnosis . This method diagnosis painful require measurement , sometimes invasive , make point time . ACS disease process develop time therefore someone may ACS time examination , may develop several hour later . The treatment ACS call fasciotomy . This treatment involve make large incision knee ankle side low leg . The NIRS device already clear FDA detect blood flow brain anesthesia . NIRS may also helpful diagnose ACS . Two primary advantage device noninvasive ( painful ) collect data continuously , disease develops , detect early treat appropriately . In order prove , device must first test take series measurement people uninjured ( control group ) , serious leg injury ( investigational group ) , people critically injured state , without leg injury ( critical control ) . The goal study collect information necessary understand create decision-making guideline use NIRS monitoring diagnose direct treatment ACS . Information study collect hospital . The study participant group 2 category : Cohort 1 : Patients critically injure , low leg injury Cohort 2 : Patients low leg injury fall certain high-energy category ( see Eligibility Criteria , Section 7.1 ) This observational study , mean data collect intended impact patient 's course care . At point time , treatment direct patient 's doctor include decision regard operative care , non-operative care in-patient management . In fact , study blind , mean doctor treat study patient able see NIRS value . This study enroll approximately 120 subject three site : Athens Regional Medical Center , Atlanta Medical Center , Grady Memorial Hospital , period approximately 18 month . Participation last 48 hour , unless patient develops sign compartment syndrome case monitoring may extend 72 hour completion assessment patient treat ACS . Participants undergo follow procedure : Beyond standard care : 1 . Patient interview collect information medical history , medication , mechanism injury 2 . Photograph ( ) take document NIRS pad placement muscle compartment injury severity ( face include ) . 3 . Ultrasound measure thickness fat layer ( BX 2000 ) detect distance patient 's skin surface underlie muscle 4 . Light scan measurement skin color ( Dermaspectrometer ) see patient 's skin color affect NIRS reading 5 . Near-infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measure patient 's muscle oxygen level . These device completely noninvasive , mean sharp painful portion device measurement process . The NIRS device use small pad , like EKG pad , stick patient 's skin give harmless , painless light continually measure patient 's muscle oxygen level . These measure record monitor later download use evaluate device 's ability detect critical change muscle oxygen level . Standard care : 1 . Data record patient 's medical record base procedure order patient 's provider , include : lab value , Stryker measurement , vital sign . 2 . Among Cohort 2 patient , data associate surgical procedure collect record operating room . This data gather standard care , blood pressure All information keep private secure , sensitive information collect .</detailed_description>
