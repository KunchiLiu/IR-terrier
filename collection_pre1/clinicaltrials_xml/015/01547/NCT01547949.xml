	<brief_title>Efficacy Tart Cherry Juice Reducing Muscle Injury Biomarkers Muscle Damage Among Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous antioxidant anti-inflammatory agent identify tart cherry , study among healthy , non-exercising individual demonstrate tart cherry decrease post-exercise weakness muscle pain . The purpose study assess analgesic myoprotective effect tart cherry juice among healthy subject randomize , placebo control , double-blind , crossover design trial . Fifteen healthy individual perform bout eccentric elbow flexion contraction ( 2 x 10 near maximum ) , ingest 10 fl oz cherry juice placebo juice twice day four day , begin immediately post exercise . Before exercise , three day follow eccentric exercise , blood drawn measure serum biomarkers muscle damage muscle soreness record . The protocol repeat 9-10 day washout period subject consume alternative juice second trial . The opposite arm perform eccentric exercise second bout avoid repeat bout protective effect . The study 's outcome 1 ) ass change serum biomarkers muscle damage , 2 ) ass change muscle soreness .</detailed_description>
