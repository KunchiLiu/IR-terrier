	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) recover completely . Others , however , develop post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , anxiety depression . Research suggest level brain chemical call GABA may differ people PTSD compare without PTSD . Researchers want see TBI affect GABA brain help develop PTSD . To look brain , researcher use image study chemical 11C-Flumazenil , help scan show GABA level brain . Objectives : - To study relationship PTSD TBI . Eligibility : The subject recruit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) . - Individuals 18 50 year age PTSD and/or mild TBI . - Healthy individual 18 50 year age history TBI history PTSD . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Urine breath sample also collect . - Participants two image study , day possible . The first magnetic resonance image scan look brain . The second positron emission tomography scan study chemical look GABA pathways brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The primary objective study investigate potential role mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) development post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . We characterize central GABAergic system function patient PTSD TBI ( TBI-PTSD ) , subject TBI ( TBI-no PTSD ) , subject PTSD ( PTSD-no TBI ) , healthy non-TBI non-PTSD subject ( HC ) , use PET imaging ( 11 ) C-Flumazenil ( FMZ ) . Our hypothesis neuronal axonal damage due TBI result GABAergic system dysfunction could potentially lead contribute development PTSD . We also correlate degree ( 11 ) C-FMZ bind abnormality time elapse since original physical psychological trauma TBI-PTSD PTSD-no TBI patient . Study Population Fifty-six male female adult subject recruit : 14 subject PTSD follow episode non-penetrating mTBI ( TBI-PTSD ) , 14 subject mTBI history PTSD ( TBI-no PTSD ) , 14 subject PTSD history TBI ( PTSD-no TBI ) , 14 healthy volunteer ( HC ) PTSD history TBI . The subject recruit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) . Design This prospective case-control study four subject group mention . Subjects stratify accord detailed psychiatric evaluation perform WRNMMC . Subjects treat experimental therapy part research study . This study provide direct benefit subject . Outcome Measures The main outcome measure ( 11 ) C-FMZ bind potential ( BP ) differences among four subject group . Other outcome measure include Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) anatomical finding correlation ( 11 ) C-FMZ bind abnormality time elapse since original physical trauma TBI-PTSD group original psychological trauma PTSD group .</detailed_description>
