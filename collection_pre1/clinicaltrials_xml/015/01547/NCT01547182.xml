	<detailed_description>Although aerobic exercise training ( AT ) cornerstone rehabilitation patient CVD MetS , expert agree escalate problem obesity , prevention program area need target weight loss ( WL ) well . This reinforced recent research show obesity major risk factor physical disability among old adult . From translational perspective , clinical researcher recommend effective community partnership need deliver program . In response call , investigator recently complete translational study fund NHLBI , Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program ( CLIP ) . In investigation , 288 obese , old adult CVD MetS randomize successful age control treatment ( SA ) , AT , AT+WL 18-months . The primary outcome mobility disability , assess performance 400 Walk Test ( 400MWT ) , staff co-delivered intervention agent 3 county within community infrastructure North Carolina Cooperative Extension Centers . Whereas mobility improve significantly AT group compare SA , AT+WL superior either SA AT . Building CLIP , investigator propose increase translational significance intervention deliver exclusively community partner staff `` trainer adviser '' desire behavior change . In addition , study provide first large scale randomize controlled clinical trial evaluate effect diet-induced weight loss ( WL ) mobility obese , old adult CVD MetS compare WL combined physical activity . The dual primary outcome 400MWT muscle strength . Because uncertainty exist best approach promote WL old adult due concern loss lean mass , design also permit contrast AT+WL resistance exercise training ( RT ) +WL muscle strength . Consistent CLIP , WL intervention target protein intake 0.8 g∙kg body mass-1∙d-1 . Reasons consider RT+WL old adult include : 1 ) central role muscle loss decline strength mobility disability ; 2 ) underappreciated role RT cardiovascular health ; 3 ) influence muscle mass rest total energy expenditure well fat mass bone health ; 5 ) potential value RT improve mobility task depend heavily vertical movement center mass ( e.g. , stair climb ) . Eves Plotnikoff22 emphasize importance RT old diseased population state `` investigator need discover practical , sustainable , economically viable way safely implement RT population level . '' To accomplish goal , investigator create community partnership YMCA , use 4 site Forsyth County , NC . One sit serf large African American population . The investigator move project Cooperative Extension Centers YMCA former neither equipment personnel necessary independently train monitor RT AT .</detailed_description>
