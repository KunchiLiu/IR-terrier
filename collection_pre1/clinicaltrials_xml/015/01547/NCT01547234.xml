	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common chronic neurological disease affect young adult , onset usually age 20-40 year . Women affect 3-4 time men . The disease characterize 2 main phenotype : relapsing-remitting progressive course . Relapsing-remitting ( RR ) MS common type disease , affect 60 85 % patient . This form characterize relapse lead disability follow period remission may last month decade . During remission patient experience significant improvement condition . This form may transform another disease type : Secondary progressive ( SP ) MS , continuous deterioration disability relapse . Primary-progressive ( PP ) MS- characterize progressive decline patient condition remission . MS complex multi-factorial disease , underlie genetic environmental factor . Different population different susceptibility . It characterize invasion cell immune system cell central nervous system ( CNS ) provoke inflammatory reaction myelin -producing cells- olgodendrocytes well neurodegeneration . Myelin electrically insulate material surround axon enhances passage electrical signal within CNS . As consequence neuro-inflammatory neurodegenerative process CNS , various neurologic system may affect : motor , sensory , visual , cognitive cerrebellar sphincter , , lead variety neurological symptom sign , accordingly . Treatment : Following increase understanding disease last 10-15 year , subcutaneous injection immunotherapy available long term management include Glatiramer acetate- copaxon interferon beta derivatives- Avonex , Rebif , Betaferon , Tysabri develop approve treatment . An orally administer drug recently approve use - Gilenya , others currently develop . Treatment drug decrease disease activity , though cure disease . These treatment partially efficient suitable patient RRMS . There available treatment patient PPMS whose disability progress continuously time . In addition disease modify therapy ( DMTs ) immunomodulatory control disease activity progression , treatment target specific symptom MS , : Provigil treatment fatigue . Regarding problem relate spasticity relate gait problem , state 40 % MS patient main complaint - present treatment include : non-pharmacological treatment physiotherapy , occupational therapy , hydrotherapy pharmacological treatment Baclofen , Tizanidine Botulinium toxin . Fampyra ( Fampridine ) recently approve use patient gait problem . This drug act block potassium ion channel prove improve walk 35 % patient . Improvement see one month treatment . Presently , medication offer MS patient walk disability predict patient benefit . The common adverse reaction : Urinary tract infection , Insomnia , Dizziness , Headache , Nausea , Asthenia , Back pain . Less common adverse reaction : MS relapse , Paresthesia , Nasopharyngitis , Constipation , Dyspepsia , Pharyngolaryngeal pain . In addition , high dos ( &gt; 10mg two time day ) drug increase risk seizure therefore contraindicate patient moderate-severe renal failure history seizure . Fampyra approve treatment walk disability MS patient effect Fampyra hand function MS yet study . Since Fampyra improve walk function person MS block potassium channel therefore improve nerve conductivity , may also affect hand function mechanism . The aim research project assess effect treatment Fampyra hand function patient MS . PATIENTS RECRUITMENT MS patient visit MS center clinic Carmel Medical Center , walk disability eligible Fampyra treatment , also manual dysfunction , offer participate study . Participants receive explanation Prof. Miller , attend neurologist authorize Prof Miller , study aim protocol , sign inform consent . Information regard personal family medical history , include data education occupation , demographic ethnicity data , data smoke diet habit collect via questionnaire . Medical staff fill clinical questionnaire detail patient clinical status prior study . Data also collect medical record , necessary . Data collect participant physician fill form medical record store Excel data base . The medication provide line indication Israeli health basket . FOLLOW UP PROGRAM Meetings ' schedule 1 . 2-4 week start Fampyra treatment . 2 . A month start Fampyra treatment . 3 . 3 month start Fampyra treatment . 4 . 4 month start Fampyra treatment . Compliance treatment assess collection empty vial medication . In 4 meeting follow evaluation perform : I . Evaluation manual function : 1 . Computerized Penmanship Evaluation Tool ( ComPET ) - An objective evaluation tool , include digitize tablet on-line handwriting data collection analysis software.This unique data collection analysis program include suite on-line , computerized task program C++ implement via MATLAB software toolkits , use administer stimulus collect analyze data . The writing task perform A4 size line paper ( spacing=0.5 cm ) affix surface WACOM Intuos II ( 407 X 417 X 36.3 mm ) x-y digitize tablet use wireless electronic pen pressure sensitive , ink tip ( model Up 401 ) . The pen size weight similar normal pen ( length=150 mm , circumference=35 mm , weight=11 gm ) . Displacement , pressure , pen tip angle sample 100 Hz via 90 MHz Pentium laptop computer . Writing task include participant 's signature copying short paragraph . The rational selection item commonly occur functional task relevance participant . Signing one 's signature familiar hence execute almost automatically . Copying short paragraph somewhat complex lengthy would thus reflect every day performance prolong task entail perceptual-motor component integration . The system sample temporal , spatial pressure data . The outcome measure , base previous study result know characteristic patient MS , include On-paper In-air time ( i.e. , time write pen contact paper second ) whole task segment , mean segment width length millimeter , mean pressure mean standard deviation pressure non-scaled unit 0-1023 . This computerized system enable dynamic handwriting evaluation ; previous study establish ComPET 's discriminate validity control group group participant varied pathology well age group . Concurrent validity also establish . The write text Hebrew , Russian Arabic language accord patient preference . The text participant would request copy annexed appendix 1 . 2 . Nine Hole Peg test - This simple test evaluate coordination fine motor skill proven reliable previous study . This timed test patient must insert nine small peg nine correspond hole . 3 . Arthritis Hand Function test - This test comprehend list daily activity test . Patients perform 5 task : shoelace tying , fastening/unfastening 2 safety pin , pour glass water , button insert coin container . Activities time score give accordingly . 4 . Jamar Dynamometer - This apparatus serve document manual function measure grip strength . It base hydraulics measure isometric strength . It proven previous study reliable safe . 5 . Pinch Meter - In test apparatus hold two finger ( thumb index ) measure pinch strength hand . It useful tool early detection motor function loss . 6 . Dreiser Functional Index - This ten-question questionnaire evaluate aspect daily manual function hold cutlery , buttoning , open lock key , etc . This questionnaire widely use evaluate manual function patient osteoarthritis . II . Evaluation ambulation : Since Fampyra show improve walk 35 % patient , participant walk disability hand function disability , improvement hand function compare improvement walk . As state earlier , medication effective treatment mobility problem 35 % patient . Therefore investigator evaluate walk improvement compare improvement hand function . 1 . Timed 25-foot walk - This test assess walk speed . It use measure improvement ambulation clinical trial Fampyra . 2 . 12MSWS questionnaire - 12-question questionnaire specifically design assess ambulation MS patient . III . General function questionnaire : 1 . General neurological function include Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) . 2 . Mini-Mental State Exam . 3 . Geriatric Depression Scale . 4 . Daily Living Questionnaire . 5 . Personal , familial write characteristic questionnaire . 6 . Diagnostic clinical history questionnaire . 7 . Follow clinical history questionnaire .</detailed_description>
