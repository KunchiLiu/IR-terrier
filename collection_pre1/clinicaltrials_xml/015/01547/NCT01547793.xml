	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people sickle cell disease different health problem others . This may relate easily frequently red blood cell break apart blood . Researchers want test breath blood sample people sickle cell disease look small amount carbon monoxide , produce red blood cell break apart . They compare result breath sample healthy volunteer . Studying different level carbon monoxide may help predict health problem person sickle cell disease may get . It may also provide information possible treatment . Objectives : - To study breath carbon monoxide level possible relation severity sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age sickle cell disease . - Healthy volunteer match age , sex , race sickle cell disease group . Design : - Participants screen medical history . - Participants sickle cell disease provide blood sample heart function test . They also breathe bag provide exhale breath sample . - Healthy volunteer provide exhale breath sample . - No treatment care provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 % African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 % sickle cell trait . Hemoglobin S polymerization lead red cell rigidity , microvascular obstruction , inflammation , end-organ ischemic injury . Our publish data indicate 50 % sickle cell patient vascular dysfunction due impaired bioavailability endogenous nitric oxide , due large part scavenge nitric oxide cell-free hemoglobin . In previous study demonstrate steady-state serum LDH strongly associate 1 ) marker intravascular hemolysis include plasma cell-free hemoglobin arginase level , 2 ) level soluble endothelial adhesion molecule , 3 ) impair vasodilatory response NO donor . Further , significant steady-state LDH elevation identify subset patient cohort well CSSCD cohort increase risk develop pulmonary hypertension , cutaneous leg ulceration , priapism , early death . Previous biochemical study demonstrate significant transient increase serum LDH plasma hemoglobin level VOC , presume hyperhemolysis confirm 51Cr label RBC study reveal decrease RBC survival VOC . However , serum LDH level specific biomarker hemolysis , furthermore observation RBC survival correlate marker intravascular hemolysis baseline patient sickle cell disease order confirm presence chronic hyperhemolysis subphenotypes sickle cell disease posit previous work . The current gold standard random cohort label RBCs use quantitate RBC survival suffer many technical drawback make impractical routine clinical use . The production rate expire CO previously use assess RBC survival , base upon principal virtually CO produce human being result cleavage ? -methene bond heme completely excrete via lung . Because RBC destruction account approximately 80 % heme turnover body , endogenous CO production use quantitative indicator RBC life span . Furne et al previously report development simple , rapid , noninvasive method determine RBC life span base measurement exhale alveolar CO concentration immediately upon awaken correct atmospheric CO , determine device simulates body equilibration CO result comparable standard labeling technique . We propose methodology could also provide quantitative , simple , noninvasive test study RBC life span thus rate hemolysis patient sickle cell disease . This trial aim 1 ) establish use end-alveolar CO concentration quantitative measure RBC life span hemolytic rate subject sickle cell disease ; 2 ) investigate association end-alveolar CO concentration-derived RBC life span laboratory measure hemolytic severity ; 3 ) investigate association end-alveolar CO concentration-derived RBC life span incidence various clinical sequela sickle cell disease .</detailed_description>
