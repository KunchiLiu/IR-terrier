	<brief_summary>We aim evaluate protective effect eradication HP continue use Geranylgeranylacetone ( GGA ) NSAIDs related gastroenterological lesion . We aim explore effect GGA small-intestinal mucosal injury induce diclofenac sodium patient rheumatic disease n't take NSAIDs precede 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Prevention Treatment NSAIDs Related Gastrointestinal Side Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSAIDs mainly use drug rheumatic disease cardiologic disease . However gastroenterological lesion prevent patient get benefit continue take NSAIDs . HP another important factor increase gastroenterological lesion . Both HP NSAIDs increase risk peptic ulcer , however , exact relation two factor find . It important evaluate protective effect eradication HP NSAIDs-taking patient . In many country , PPI recommend maintain treatment NSAIDs-taking patient prevent gastroenterological lesion . A multicenter , open-label , randomize , parallel-group study need prove effect Teprenone replacer PPI maintain treatment.On hand , Small-intestinal mucosal injury induce non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) common . However , still effective reliable intervention establish . Geranylgeranylacetone ( GGA ) mucosal protective agent , develop additional trail clarify discrepancy GGA effect NSAIDs-induced small-intestinal mucosal injury .</detailed_description>
