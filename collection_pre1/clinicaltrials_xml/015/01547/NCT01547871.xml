	<brief_summary>Background : - Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 ( SMA 1 ) cause severe muscle weakness problem eat breathing . The symptom begin infancy , child affect SMA 1 often die early childhood . Researchers want collect information SMA symptom progress first two year . Objectives : - To study symptom SMA 1 progress infant child . Eligibility : - Infants child SMA 1 bear January 1 , 2007 . Design : - Researchers review child medical record talk parent telephone . - For child 2 year age , researcher review child medical record speak telephone every 2-4 month . Phone call parent take 10 minute involve question symptom SMA 1 . Children follow age 2.- Researchers also interest look medical record child longer alive 2 year age . Parents child come NIH . They provide consent view record , information telephone . - No treatment care provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To conduct pilot , observational , retrospective prospective , natural history study infant affect spinal muscular atrophy type 1 ( SMA 1 ) . The goal ass feasibility study design order plan large study aim understand change natural history obtain current data survival patient affect SMA 1 . This information important design clinical trial . Study Population : Up 50 child bear January 1 , 2007 clinical diagnosis SMA 1 genetic test consistent homozygous mutation SMN 1 gene chromosome 5q13 enrol study . Design : This longitudinal pilot study demonstrate study design feasibility test outcome measure assess natural history infant affect SMA 1 . Pertinent clinical demographic data collect . The data collection retrospective decease infant child alive age 2 year time enrollment . A combination retrospective prospective data collect infant alive less 2 year age time enrollment . The data collect remotely National Institutes Health ( NIH ) medical chart review and/or telephone questionnaire obtain parent infant SMA 1 . Infants alive enrollment follow prospectively age 2 year death , whichever occur first . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome pilot study demonstrate feasibility study design outcome measure patient SMA 1 . Secondary outcome include evaluation time event , i.e. , time ventilator support &gt; =16 hour day continuously 2 week time death . Additional demographic clinical data pertinent respiratory nutritional aspect collect assess possible factor influence outcome measure .</detailed_description>
