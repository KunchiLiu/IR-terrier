	<detailed_description>Transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) urologic surgery use treatment non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . A potential complication procedure bladder rupture injury secondary adductor muscle contraction obturator nerve stimulation . This risk increase resection lateral wall tumor , electrosurgical resection lesion likely inadvertently stimulate obturator nerve . There several mechanism prevent obturator reflex . Pharmacologic paralysis reliably inhibit thigh adduction . However , TURBT often short procedure amendable intermediate duration neuromuscular blocking medication . The use succinylcholine another option limit short duration action may adequate time need resect tumor . Additionally , many patient contraindication use succinylcholine . Spinal anesthesia reliably prevent obturator reflex . Regional anesthesia another potential treatment modality prevent obturator reflex TURBT . Motor blockade obturator nerve prevent adduction event inadvertent nerve stimulation . Peripheral blockade obturator nerve combine either general spinal anesthesia . Historically , obturator nerve block ( ONB ) consider technically challenging procedure . Recently , however , successful ultrasound guide ONB technique report . To best knowledge study date compare effectiveness ONB achieve anatomic landmark ( nerve stimulation ) versus ultrasound guide ONB ( nerve stimulation ) prevent obturator reflex TURBT surgery . The key objective study compare success rate ultrasound guide obturator nerve block anatomic guide obturator nerve block determine neuromonitoring endpoint surgeon observation .</detailed_description>
