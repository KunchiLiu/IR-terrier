	<detailed_description>This multi-center study consist two part : Part A Part B . Part A investigate dose-ranging pharmacokinetics tolerability GWP42003-P. Part B 1:1 randomize , placebo-controlled 60 day comparison GWP42003-P placebo , dose identify Part A maximum tolerate dose . Part B investigate efficacy safety GWP42003-P . Following completion Part B , patient invite continue receive GWP42003-P open label extension study ( separate protocol ) . Part A Following establishment initial eligibility baseline measurement , patient enter Part A Visit 1 begin two month baseline observation period . Patients record number convulsive seizure , seizure , use IVRS telephone diary system ( recorded twice day ) . Each call take approximately five minute complete . Patients return clinic Visit 2 investigator assess patient 's daily number convulsive seizures patient 's IVRS data . Patients experience least four convulsive seizure ( tonic-clonic seizure and/or drop attack ) per month previous two month ) meet inclusion/ exclusion criterion eligible continue study . Patients ask information regard AEs , concomitant medication and/or change medication . Eligible patient enter pharmacokinetics part study Visit 2 blood sample take use sparse sample strategy minimize blood volume require analysis plasma concentration/time curve concomitant AEDs routine safety blood . This conducted prior administration Study medication Dose Level 1 . In dose level , patient randomly assign eight patient receive GWP42003-P two patient receive placebo group . Patients receive study medication day seven day exposure period . During part study , patient continue record daily number convulsive seizure seizure , use IVRS telephone diary system . At Day 7 ( Visit 3 ) , blood take analysis plasma concentration/time curve GWP42003-P major metabolite , concomitant anti-epileptic medication routine safety purpose . At end dose period Part A study patient continue placebo ready enter Part B study . Dose Level 2 follow set procedure Dose Level 1 , dose start evaluation clinical pharmacokinetic result Dose Group 1 complete . Subsequently Dose Groups 3 4 subject procedure . When Dose Group 4 complete seven day Dosing Period , subject assessment clinical safety pharmacokinetics , patient invite continue Part B , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled phase investigate efficacy safety GWP42003-P . There washout period least two week last dosing day Part A randomization Part B . Part B Patients , dose group , complete invited participate Part B 1:1 randomize , placebo-controlled 60 day comparison GWP42003-P placebo . They receive dose identify Part A maximum tolerate dose . Part B investigate efficacy safety GWP42003-P. During Part B , patient continue record number convulsive seizure seizure , use IVRS telephone diary system ( recorded twice day ) . Assessments also make cognitive function , nocturnal sleep quality daytime sleepiness . Note : Eligible patient previously participate Part A , wish participate Part B begin two month baseline observation period establish baseline . Patients follow procedure outline Visit 1 ( Part A ) . Patients record number convulsive seizure ( seizure ) , use IVRS telephone diary system ( recorded twice day ) . Part A : The primary endpoint safety tolerability profile single multiple ascend dos GWP42003-P compare placebo . The variable analysis difference incidence , type severity AEs , vital sign , ECG , laboratory , physical examination parameter GWP42003-P compare placebo . Part B : The primary endpoint number patient experience least 50 % reduction number convulsive seizure ( baseline ) active treatment compare placebo . Part A : Pharmacokinetic : 1 . GWP42003-P : The plasma concentration/time curve describe follow multiple dos GWP42003-P , aim define - Cmax - tmax - AUC0-∞ , AUC0-t - t½ The analytes pharmacokinetic analysis CBD major human metabolite 7-OH-CBD . 2 . Concomitant AEDs : The plasma concentration/time curve concomitant AEDs describe pre-treatment , seven day treatment GWP42003-P , use sparse sample strategy . As far possible , plasma concentration/time relationship pre-treatment compare result follow treatment GWP42003-P. Part B : Efficacy : 1 . Number type non-convulsive seizure 2 . Cognitive function 3 . Sleep quality 4 . Caregiver Global Impression Change</detailed_description>
