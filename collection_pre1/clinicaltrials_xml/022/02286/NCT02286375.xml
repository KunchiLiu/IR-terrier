	<detailed_description>A staff community center service area take part study involve draw list potential participant accessible population . Simple random sample adopt recruit participant . Those meet inclusion exclusion criterion agree participate research study assign intervention group customary care group accord result randomization . Sample size calculation base power analysis . Power analysis adopts hypothesis-testing method determine sample size accord several parameter include pre-specified significance level , desired power level expect effect size . Assuming two-tailed alpha 0.05 , probability 0.2 beta error ( 80 % power ) , effect size 0.28 calculate respect primary outcome measure ( self-efficacy ) result two previous research provide home visit telephone follow old adult , 200 subject per group require . With reference 10 % 15 % attrition report previous community-dwelling elderly program , assume 20 % drop rate study , total sample size need 240 subject per group i.e . total 480 subject . In order assure number group equal , block randomization method use . Before randomization , project team member involve subject recruitment data collection prepare block randomization list 240 set number either 0 ( customary care group ) 1 ( intervention group ) use computer software Research Randomizer ( http : //www.randomizer.org/ ) . These 240 set number print separately seal envelope . Another project team member , successfully recruit subject , unfold envelope sequence enrol participant finish baseline assessment ready intervention . The number write envelope represent group particular subject . The group assignments keep blinded participant whole study period . However , nurse case manager provide care participant know group allocation . Therefore , study single-blinded design . In order minimize bias , nurse case manager participate data collection procedure . Descriptive analysis calculate use mean standard deviation continuous variable , percentage frequency categorical variable , median quartile range continuous variable normally distribute . Independent t-tests , Mann-Whitney U test , chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use compare difference socio-demographic data outcome variable group . Significant result indicate p-value statistical analysis less 0.05 two-tailed test . To determine difference change study group control group ( group effect ) , within group effect ( time ) , interaction effect ( group x time ) , two way repeat measure Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) co-variances ( ANCOVA ) apply assumption parametric test fulfil . When data fulfill assumption parametric test , Mann-Whitney U test apply compare difference group time interval Friedman test use determine time effect within group . The miss data present study handle intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . Sensitivity analysis adopt compare result use different miss data handling approach accord Crochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions . Data compute analyzed assistant Statistical package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 21 software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago ) . All questionnaire measure outcome variable study demonstrate good validity reliability . Nurse case manager social worker train research team member order provide consistent intervention various professional health-social care team ensure quality program . The nurse case manager employ criterion experience community nursing background . The process home visit telephone conversation record review evaluation . The research team member health-social care team member meet regularly discus case ensure practice align protocol . This randomize control study also stringently follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement .</detailed_description>
