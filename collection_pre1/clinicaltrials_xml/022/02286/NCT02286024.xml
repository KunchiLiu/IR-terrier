	<brief_summary>Depression debilitate illness risk develop treatment resistant form . Currently , diagnosis purely clinical little feature available identify potentially adverse development . Clinical feature early onset age , prolong episode , anxiety , somatic symptom apathy argument raise fear onset resistance conventional treatment . According neuroimaging knowledge pathophysiological mechanism , involve front-limbic functional network support function emotional regulation reward system , recent work focus identification neuroimaging biomarkers predict therapeutic response . Among region interest identify , anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , hippocampus , region participate Default Mode Network Training ( Medial prefrontal cortex , posterior cingulate cortex , inferior parietal lobe ) frequently area associate prediction therapeutic response . Limitations report study heterogeneity experimental paradigm ( rest state , cognitive emotional functional task ) , image ( PET scan , MRI ) heterogeneity clinical resistance criterion form study , different technique ( consider remission ( threshold score ) response ( 50 % decrease baseline score ) , sample size . Knowing MRI daily clinical practice SHU Adult Psychiatry , balance sheet disease , monitor evolution , assumption rTMS ( repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ) ( pretreatment assessment neuro ) , identification neuroimaging biomarkers population patient clinical criterion Mood Depressive Episode , acquisition identical reproducible image daily routine methodology appear reliable way correct heterogeneity conventionally publish study topic .

	<detailed_description>The main objective ass neuroimaging biomarkers like cortical thickness predictive poor outcome major depressive disorder . Secondary objective : - Identifying neuroimaging biomarker like Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) predictive poor outcome major depressive disorder ; - Identifying morphological biomarker like volumetric abnormality ( Voxel Based Morphometry - VBM ) , cortical thickness , predictive poor outcome major depressive disorder ; - Identifying clinical feature ( sociodemographic , clinical dimension apathy anxiety ) predictive poor outcome depression . This study expect assess large population patient : - Clinical neuroimaging marker ( morphological perfusion ) predictive poor outcome major depressive disorder , allow early identification patient risk poor therapeutic response . These marker allow good stratification patient ; - A good characterization pathophysiological process involve major depressive disorder different stage illness ; - Development innovative technology treatment repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation , neurofeedback use real time fMRI , aspects evaluation effectiveness optimization procedure . Such study would open think term therapeutic management . Indeed , recurrent potentially resistant form screen use predictive neuroimaging biomarkers could serve specific therapeutic approach preventive approach .</detailed_description>
