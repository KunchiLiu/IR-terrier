	<brief_title>Immune Response Rotavirus Vaccine After Supplemental Dose Given 9 Months Age With Local EPI Vaccines Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , individual-randomized , parallel-group , comparative immunogenicity trial . Participating infant randomize Group A receive one dose measles vaccine ( MV ) , yellow fever vaccine ( YFV ) , meningitis conjugate vaccine ( PsA-TT-5μg ) 9 month age , infant randomize Group B receive one dose MV , YFV , PsA-TT-5μg , PRV 9 month age . The study simultaneously evaluate two primary objective , one noninferiority response MV give PRV ( co-primary objective 1 ) one noninferiority response YFV give PRV ( co-primary objective 2 ) . For evaluation co-primary objective , venous blood specimen collect immediately prior receipt study vaccine 4 week ( plus 1 week ) later . Measles immunogenicity evaluate measure MV neutralize antibody seroconversion rate geometric mean concentration ( GMCs ) 4 week post-vaccination . Yellow fever immunogenicity evaluate measure yellow fever serum neutralize antibody seroconversion rate geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) 4 week post-vaccination For secondary objective noninferiority response PsA-TT-5μg give PRV superiority supplemental dose PRV , PsA-TT-5μg immunogenicity evaluate measure serum bactericidal activity ( SBA ) seroconversion rate GMTs 4 week post-vaccination . PRV immunogenicity evaluate measure anti-rotavirus Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) seroconversion rate GMCs 4 week post-vaccination . Immediate adverse reaction , solicit adverse reaction , unsolicited adverse event , serious adverse event , especially intussusception , assess home visit study clinic visit Days 1-5 , 7 , 28 , 56 , 84 . As part safety evaluation , malaria test conduct Days 0 , 28 84 .</detailed_description>
