	<brief_summary>The main aim project establish whether ambulatory oxygen patient fibrotic ILD whose oxygen saturation fall ≤ 88 % 6MWT , lead significant improvement health status . The core project four week randomise , crossover control trial ambulatory oxygen use daily activity . The optimal Oxygen flow rate determine titration screen visit administer activity two-week period , compare two week oxygen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan non-commercial study randomise , control crossover trial ambulatory oxygen ambulatory oxygen four week period ( two week ambulatory oxygen two week air , portable device ) , evaluate effect ambulatory oxygen health status patient ILD . A short crossover study context many advantage , since ambulatory oxygen immediate effect , wash-out period need use . The primary outcome study change health status , measure K-BILD questionnaire ( Thorax 2012 67 : 804-810 ) . At start trial , effect ambulatory oxygen 6 Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) parameter evaluate oxygen air-filled canister , patient blind content canister , ass whether oxygen-induced improvement 6MWT parameter predict effectiveness day day life . The 6MWT well establish highly reproducible test validate ILD patient , significant prognostic implication . The study design include placebo arm : 1 . The intervention combination possible benefit oxygen disadvantage canister weight . These separate . Placebo control impossible mean provide placebo weight . Attempts control solely oxygen use without take canister weight account clinically meaningless . In recent COPD , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study , cylinder weight report barrier use 93 % study participant . 2 . A positive result air-filled canister arm would clinically uninterpretable . This study design 'placebo ' would actively harmful study participant . Carriage air-filled cylinder would expect lead earlier desaturation reduce exercise tolerance . Such design would inform real life comparison oxygen plus cylinder intervention . 3 . All aside , blind legally impossible ( UK health safety regulation require oxygen cylinder home use must clearly label ) . It also stress objective measure change evaluate secondary end-points : investigator expect explore correlation variable primary end-point exclude possibility observe treatment benefit primary end-point might confound placebo effect . A depth qualitative assessment impact ambulatory oxygen undertaken via semi-structured interview , subset 20 patient , investigate patient ' carers ' personal perspective ambulatory oxygen affect day day life . The interview conduct within 2 week end treatment visit . Patients Royal Brompton Hospital site approach researcher end treatment visit ask participate qualitative assessment . If patient agrees date agree patient interviewed venue convenient ( usually patient 's home ) . During interview semi-structured topic guide address practical barrier optimal oxygen usage , practical , social psychological difficulty encounter , concerned dependency , view information require prior ambulatory oxygen prescription . The interview also explore patient ' ( carers ' ) experience participate trial . Notes write interview aid reflective analytical process . Individual fee back system service could improve assess need patient future involvement incorporate design patient future involvement incorporate design patient centre device . Qualitative interview analysis : Interviews transcribe verbatim . Interview transcript analyse thematically use framework approach . Atlas/ti computer software ( http : //atlasti.com ) use manage index data prior chart , map interpretation .</detailed_description>
