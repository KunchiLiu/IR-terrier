	<brief_summary>Distal radius fracture ( DRF ) among common fracture long bone , comprise one sixth fracture . Due high prevalence , effect patient ' everyday life , cost national health resource , proper management important . The investigator perform prospective randomize clinical trial 100 patient DRFs . 50 patient treat group either short long arm cast . Patients visit 6th 18th week reduction regard loss reduction possible complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain institutional review board ( IRB ) approval , investigator perform prospective randomize clinical trial patient DRFs admit three medical center September 2010 February 2011 . Patients sign consent form prior enrolment . investigator include patient old 20 year close distal radial physis initial radiographic evidence extra articular DRF least one non-comminuted cortex . All fracture type A2 accord AO classification . The investigator consider fracture dorsal angulation 20 degree , radial shorten 10 millimeter extensive cortical comminution unstable fracture . Patients unstable fracture exclude study . Other exclusion criterion existence multiple fracture open fracture affect limb limb , cerebral palsy , paresthesia affect limb due pervious cerebro-vascular accident , previous severe deformity affect limb , diabetes severe osteoporosis . Th investigator also exclude patient less two consecutive follow-up visit . All eligible patient sign informed consent . One hundred four patient eligible included study ; The investigator exclude four patient , tend participate process follow-up . The investigator divide 100 remain patient reduction SAC reduction LAC group base table random number . The investigator perform plain anterior posterior ( AP ) lateral radiograph affect wrist patient initially determine fracture severity . Based radial height , radial inclination palmar tilt initial radiograph , patient divide two group . There significant difference group regard pre-operative fracture characteristic . Most fracture reduce local anesthesia general anesthesia regional block perform select patient . The technique reduction slight traction counter-traction manipulation method . In SAC group , investigator position forearm neutral rotation volar-ulnar deviation . The investigator apply The cast metacarpophalangeal joint dorsally proximal palmar crease volarly , extend one inch distal antecubital fossa anteriorly olecranon posteriorly . Three point inter osseous molding perform . The investigator technique LAC group . Additionally , The investigator position elbow 90 degree flexion extend plaster middle arm . The investigator perform lateral AP radiograph forearm reduction casting measure radiographic parameter ( radial height , radial inclination dorsal angulation ) . In case , anatomical reduction consider successful reduction . Immediately reduction , patient start active motion finger try elevate limb level heart . The investigator examine patient regard compartment syndrome . Besides , inform patient compartment symptom . Many patient treat ambulatory set discharge six hour observation , patient hospitalize discharge within two day reduction . The investigator check alignment radiographically second week reduction . In suspicious case loss reduction , comparison do contra-lateral wrist radiography . The investigator perform repeat reduction case unacceptable displacement . The reduction unacceptable five millimeter displacement five degree angulation . The surgeon convert LAC SAC fourth week remove cast six week . The patient start active passive motion wrist , elbow finger cast remove . Patients refer clinic 6th 18th week reduction . AP lateral plain radiography wrist perform visit . The investigator evaluate patient regard loss reduction , malunion , nonunion , carpal tunnel syndrome , compartment syndrome , limitation elbow forearm range motion ( ROM ) , number wound blister , patient 's satisfaction stability distal radioulnar joint . In case unstable distal radioulnar joint 6th week visit , cast continue three week forearm supination position . In case forearm ROM examine 9th 18th week . The investigator consider instability distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ ) tenderness DRUJ pain mobility . For assess forearm pronation supination , patient try range forearm hold pen fist elbow 90 degree flexed adduct . Limits ROM abnormal 10 degree difference compare unaffected side . The investigator score patient ' satisfaction use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) 18th week follow-up . VAS consist ten-point zero ( extremely dissatisfy ) 10 ( extremely satisfy ) . The independent-Samples t-test chi square test use statistical analysis appropriate . The level significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
