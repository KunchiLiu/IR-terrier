	<brief_title>Safety Study Eteplirsen Treat Advanced Stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center study explore safety tolerability eteplirsen injection patient advanced stage DMD confirm genetic mutation amenable treatment exon 51 skipping . Patients evaluated inclusion Screening/Baseline period 4 week . Eligible patient receive weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusions 30 mg/kg eteplirsen 96 week , follow safety extension ( exceed 48 week ) . Safety regularly assess throughout study via collection adverse event ( AEs ) , laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , echocardiogram ( ECHOs ) , vital sign , physical examination . Exploratory efficacy assessment , include PFTs , upper extremity testing , measurement functional status , occur functional assessment visit every 12 week first year treatment approximately every 24 week second year treatment .</detailed_description>
