	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn talazoparib help control advance cancer patient specific type alteration . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study BMN 673</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take talazoparib capsule mouth 1 time day . You take study drug time every day without food . If miss dose , skip dose take next dose schedule . If vomit take study drug , take another dose make . Wait take next dose schedule . Study Visits : Each study cycle 28 day . During Weeks 1 2 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker genetic testing . - During Week 1 , urine collect routine test . During Weeks 3 4 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker genetic testing . - During Week 3 , depend enrol , tumor biopsy PD testing . The study doctor discus . During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . During Weeks 2 , 3 , 4 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Weeks 4 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker genetic testing . Every 8 week 6 month every 12 week , CT MRI scan check status disease . If disease appear get good , repeat scan within 4 week . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 1 year follow-up call . End-of-Treatment Visit : Right last dose study drug , end-of-treatment visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test biomarker DNA test . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker DNA testing . Long Term Follow-Up : The study staff call ask every 12 week 1 year . Each call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Talazoparib FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 270 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
