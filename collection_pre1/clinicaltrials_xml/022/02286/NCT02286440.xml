	<brief_title>A PK/PD Genetic Variation Treatment Algorithm Versus Treatment As Usual Adolescent Management Of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment seek adolescent patient moderate severe major depressive episode define 40 great Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised ( CDRS-R ) invite participate study evaluate GeneSight® platform . This new technology rapidly assess PK PD genetic variation potentially impact antidepressant , anti-psychotic , stimulant treatment selection . These patient GeneSight® test randomize one two group . In Group 1 ( n=138 ) , GeneSight® test result available patient 's treating clinician prior treatment selection . In Group 2 ( n=138 ) , test result available patient 's research treating clinician . However , test result make available participant clinicians 8-week trial ( upon completion blind assessment week 8 ) . The patient clinical raters blind group assignment .</detailed_description>
