	<brief_title>Probiotic Supplementation Breastfed Newborn Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed phase I clinical trial parallel-group , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind ascend dose study dietary supplementation Bifidobacterium longum subsp . infantis ( B. infantis ) healthy breastfed infant evaluate safety well determine pharmacologically effective dose ( ED ) B. infantis produce least 50 % gut colonization six week age . Infants enrol sequentially group five ( three randomize receive B. infantis two receive placebo ) . For group , infant dose B. infantis placebo day 7 day 14 life . A calculated Maximally Recommended Starting Dose ( MRSD ) use initiate dose escalation define . Every two week , additional group five infant ( randomize 3:2 B. infantis placebo ) enrol receive progressively high dos B. infantis . Calculation appropriate dose escalation perform use modify Fibonacci series describe effort identify ED B. infantis . After ED B. infantis identify ( define dose capable produce 50 % gut colonization six week age ) two additional sequential dose escalation perform . The purpose final two dose escalation determine successively high dos B. infantis result increase gut colonization barrier protection ; , alternatively , Maximum Effective Dose ( MaxED ) B. infantis exist increase gut colonization barrier protection . Following final dose escalation , Hanley 's Rule Three apply order determine lower-frequency adverse event cause B. infantis . Hanley 's Rule Three state order identify adverse event occur frequency 1:10 great 95 % confidence interval , least 30 subject must enrol . Study visit schedule week 1 , 2 , 6 , 24 , 36 , 52 78 . Parents complete survey study visit monitor infant potential adverse event associate probiotic administration include feed intolerance , fever , bowel irregularity include constipation diarrhea . Stool sample collect twice weekly first six week life weekly week 24 , 36 , 52 78 . Stool sample analyze determine relative abundance B. infantis time , overall diversity gut microbiota without B. infantis supplementation . Stool also analyze milk oligosaccharide verify consumption breast milk correlate proportion human milk oligosaccharide free sugar monomer see infant stool various level B. infantis colonization . At study visit , infant receive full skin examination evaluate sign atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . The Infant Dermatitis Quality Life Index ( IDQOLI ) administer parent study visit screen possible sign AD infant irritability , skin rash hypersensitivity . If AD present , Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) grade system use assess severity . Urine sample collect study visit measure level fatty acid bind protein ( FABPs ) glutathione-S-transferase ( alpha-GST ) , non-invasive marker gastrointestinal permeability may indicate presence food allergy . Blood collect via finger heel stick week 6 52 immune phenotyping ( include measure inflammatory cytokine food-specific IgEs ) . In addition , level serum fatty acid binding protein ( FABPs ) glutathione-S-transferase ( alpha-GST ) measure marker gastrointestinal permeability potential food allergy . Parents also complete survey study visit monitor infant potential adverse event associate probiotic administration include feed intolerance , fever , bowel irregularity include constipation diarrhea . Entry study require intent breastfeed exclusively minimum six month . If mother decide discontinue breastfeeding study , investigator note infant 's chart obtain additional series weekly stool sample six week discontinuation breastfeeding . The purpose additional stool sample collection determine discontinuation breastfeed impact level exist B. infantis colonization infant gut .</detailed_description>
