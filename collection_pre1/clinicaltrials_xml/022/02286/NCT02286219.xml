	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety , tolerability , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , FS102 ( BMS-986186 ) administer intravenously ( IV ) subject relapse refractory solid tumor overexpress HER2 standard treatment option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 , Multiple Ascending Dose Study Anti-HER2 FCAB FS102 HER2 Positive Solid Tumors ( Anti HER2 Fcab )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , open-label , multiple dose escalation study subject solid tumor express HER2 . Subjects locally un-resectable and/or metastatic solid cancer express human epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor 2 ( HER2 ) standard clinical pathology criterion standard treatment option enrol series escalate dose cohort . Within dose cohort , subject receive weekly ( ± 1 day ) less frequent IV ( Q3W ) infusion FS102 initial 28-day ( 4-week ) DLT observation period . During DLT observation period , subject assess safety , tolerability , dose limit toxicity , PK , immunogenicity , clinical disease response . Following assessment Investigator , subject without clinical disease progression without unacceptable toxicity eligible continue receive FS102 six 21 ( Q3W ) 28-day ( weekly ) cycle . Continuation Phase . Subjects complete six 21-28-day cycle treatment evaluate entry extend Continuation Phase study . Subjects eligible continuation : - They demonstrate evidence disease progression ; - In opinion Investigator deem reasonably likely continue benefit treatment ; - They experience toxicity require discontinuation . During Continuation Phase , subject continue receive FS102 dose originally assign , unless modify downward earlier toxicity . No dose escalation within subject permit . Treatment may continue one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression ; - Intervening illness prevents administration treatment ; - Unacceptable adverse event ; - Significant subject non-compliance protocol ; - Pregnancy ; - Subject decide withdraw study ; - General specific change subject 's condition render subject unacceptable treatment judgment Investigator ; - Sponsor decide end study .</detailed_description>
