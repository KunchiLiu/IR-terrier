	<brief_summary>This clinical trial national multicenter randomize control trial perform parallel group aim validate treatment preserve pulp vitality mature permanent posterior teeth partial removal carious tissue restore tooth structure use simple fill one session , thus delay premature tooth age . Two successive randomization perform ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) ; firstly type excavation carry ( partial vs. complete caries removal ) secondly nature adhesive use ( antibacterial adhesive vs. non-antibacterial adhesive ) . The second randomization carry teeth require endodontic treatment first randomization . The study 's primary objective compare , 1 year follow-up , efficacy ( binary success criterion ) partial caries removal versus complete caries removal occlusal proximal deep lesion mature permanent posterior teeth ( bicuspid molar except third molar ) . Secondary objective include comparison , 1 year follow-up , efficacy ( binary success criterion ) antibacterial two-step self-etch adhesive versus traditional non-antibacterial two-step self-etch adhesive . Another secondary objective compare , two three year follow-up , efficacy partial versus complete caries removal . The primary outcome success caries removal protocol one year , measure accord 5 FDI criterion , secondary outcome contribution functional biological dimension 5 FDI criterion item determine success failure treatment . The outcome success objective , primary secondary .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Randomization n°1 Partial versus complete caries removal Patientrelated criterion : Patient consult one multicenter trial center Male female age 880 ( inclusive ) , Affiliated social security regimen Able tolerate necessary restorative procedure Provide inform consent Accepts threeyear followup period Tooth related criterion : Mature permanent posterior tooth Tooth vital pulp accord pulpsensitivity test Tooth deep ( primary secondary ) least proximal and/or occlusal carious lesion present residual dentin thickness continuity carious cavity pulp chamber . In case proximal lesion , proximal cervical limit must allow proper placement waterproof dental dam ( confirm bitewing Xray radiograph ) Tooth require direct partial restorative treatment . Randomization n°2 Antibacterial vs. non antibacterial adhesive application Tooth assign treatment randomization n°1 . Randomization n°1 Partial versus complete caries removal Patientrelated criterion : Person guardianship , pregnant nursing woman , Risk infectious endocarditis , Patient implant Cardiac Pacemaker/Defibrillator Patient severe periodontal disease ( pocket depth ≥5mm and/or mobility type IV ) , Poor oral hygiene ( abundance soft matter within gingival pocket and/or tooth gingival margin = score 3 [ Silness Loe , 1964 ] , Allergy material and/or anaesthetic use , Uncooperative patient . Tooth related criterion : Nocturnal pain cause insomnia , Tooth suffer dentin hypersensitivity ( sharp sudden pain short duration pain arise expose dentin ( erosion and/or gingival recession ) , typically response external stimulus ( air blast hypersensitivity [ Schiff et al. , 1994 ] , tactile hypersensitivity ) , Sensitivity axial lateral percussion ; Radiolucent apical image , Condensing osteitis , Tooth external internal resorption , Tooth suffer trauma , Tooth carious cervical lesion , Tooth occlusal wear associate dentine exposure , Tooth support clasp removable partial denture ( RPD ) . Tooth defect mineralization treat tooth could come contact carry restoration Randomization n°2 Antibacterial vs. non antibacterial adhesive application Tooth pulp exposure randomization n°1 require endodontic treatment ( pulp exposure &gt; 2 mm² and/or haemostasis obtain ) .</criteria>
