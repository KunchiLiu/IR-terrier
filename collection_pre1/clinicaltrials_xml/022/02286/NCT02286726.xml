	<brief_title>Study CPX-351 ( Cytarabine : Daunorubicin ) Liposome Injection Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) High Risk Induction Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group : - If Group 1 , receive low dose CPX-351 . - If Group 2 , receive high dose CPX-351 . Up 15 participant assign study group . You study staff know group . If group find safe , third group 15 participant receive even high dose study drug . The group appear best result also enroll additional 10 participant . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4-8 week long , may longer depend disease responds study drug . The study cycle Induction Consolidation Cycles . Induction Therapy design remove sign leukemia see allow normal blood cell restore . This call remission . Consolidation Therapy design cause disease stay remission . You receive CPX-351 vein 90 minute Days 1 , 3 , 5 Induction Cycle . If disease appear go remission , may receive second Induction Cycle , receive drug Days 1 3 . No 2 Induction Cycles give . If disease appear go remission , may receive 4 Consolidation Cycles , receive drug Days 1 3 . Study Visits : Because length study cycle depend disease responds study drug , visit list may need . For example , study cycle 4 week , Day 42 visit cycle . On Days 14 42 course , physical exam . On Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 , least 1 time every week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Before next cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) draw check copper level . On Day 28 Induction cycle , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease cytogenetic testing . If doctor think need , another bone marrow aspiration/biopsy 5-10 day one . Before every 2 cycle treatment , ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . If study doctor think need , do every cycle . Length Treatment : You may receive study drug 2 induction 4 consolidation cycle . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , able follow study direction . End Treatment Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check copper level . - You EKG , ECHO , and/or MUGA scan check heart function . Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , follow test procedure perform : - Every month long study doctor think need , call ask . Each call last 5-10 minute . - Every 2-3 month 1 year , often study doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check copper level . If study doctor think need , blood drawn copper level test every month . - Every 3-4 month 1 year , often study doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . - If study doctor think need , every 3-4 month 1 year , ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . This investigational study . CPX-351 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 55 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
