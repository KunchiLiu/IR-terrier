	<brief_summary>Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) characterize six- eight-fold raise plasma LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration atherosclerotic coronary artery disease usually occur age 20 untreated . Lipid apheresis ( LA ) prove reliable method decrease LDL-C concentration therefore decrease cardiovascular disease risk HoFH . The objective crossover study compare efficacy LA perform heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation dextran sulfate adsorption reduction lipid , inflammatory marker , adhesion molecule LDL particle size cohort HoFH subject .</brief_summary>
