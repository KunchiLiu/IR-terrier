	<detailed_description>- Context : Oral anticoagulation recommend prevention stroke thrombo-embolic event people age 80 year ( octo+ ) suffer non vavular atrial fibrillation ( nv AF ) without contraindication anticoagulant therapy . Two drug class available achieve oral anticoagulation : vitaminK antagonist ( VKA , warfarin , fluindione acenocoumarol ) direct oral anticoagulant ( DOA , dabigatran , rivaroxaban apixaban ) . The data evidence-based post-marketing literature benefit/risk ratio DOA comparatively VKA limit , conflict , potentially bias finally inconclusive population . Nevertheless , octo+ age bracket risk nv AF population high risk anticoagulant-related major bleeding AF-related thrombotic ( TE ) event . - Objectives : The aim study ass compare real benefit harm two therapeutic strategy available routine practice , anticoagulation octo+ suffer nvAF . The main objective estimate compare composite event include major bleeding , TE event death cause DOA VKA octo+ suffer nv AF living community nursing home setting . The secondary objective , population : estimate compare composite event DOA ( dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban ) composite event VKA , estimate compare rate occurrence component composite event patient expose DOA compare patient expose VKA , identify factor associate occurrence major bleed event TE event patient expose oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) , describe others adverse drug reaction ( ADRs ) ( serious bleed TE event ; serious serious ADRs ) provide relate rate user VKA DOA well individual DOA , describe utilization pattern oral anticoagulant . - Design : An observational multicenter prospective inception cohort conduct within PRESAGE-Network , ongoing active network drug safety old adult Ile de France ( IDF ) area ( Paris surroundings ) involve sample general practitioner ( GPs ) pharmacist , active surveillance drug safety old adult .</detailed_description>
