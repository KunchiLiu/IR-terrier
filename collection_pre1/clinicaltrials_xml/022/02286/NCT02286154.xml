	<brief_summary>The primary objective prospective study hydroxyurea child sickle cell anemia 1 ) Develop prospectively evaluate population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics model predict maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ; 2 ) Identify urine biomarkers hydroxyurea adherence use novel metabolomics approach ; 3 ) Identify pharmacogenomics modifier hydroxyurea MTD ; 4 ) Longitudinal monitoring effect hydroxyurea upon organ function quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There ample clinical evidence hydroxyurea safe effective medication adult child sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) , hematologists agree short-term safety efficacy hydroxyurea proven . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute recently release evidence-based guideline SCA , recommend hydroxyurea offer affected child young nine month age , regardless clinical severity . Despite overwhelming evidence demonstrate safety efficacy , hydroxyurea remain underutilized variety reason . In prospective study , investigator utilize innovative strategy design address overcome barrier currently limit use hydroxyurea child SCA . The investigator utilize novel laboratory technique pharmacometric model order accurately predict effective hydroxyurea dose refer maximum tolerated dose . The investigator aim develop screen urine test objectively accurately determine adherence hydroxyurea therapy . In addition , study document critical laboratory clinical characteristic unique population patient SCA begin hydroxyurea young age . This study follow two group patient . The first group , refer New Cohort , include mostly young infant receive hydroxyurea therapy upon enter study . The start dose hydroxyurea participant New Cohort individually determine use novel population PK/PD dose-prediction model . The second group study participant , refer Old Cohort , include patient already receive hydroxyurea therapy upon study entry . Both Old New Cohort ( New Cohort ) include development urine biomarker adherence follow throughout study document effect hydroxyurea upon organ function quality life . It important note therapeutic drug trial . Prior enrollment study , participant , along family clinical provider , decide initiate hydroxyurea therapy clinical indication . Except dose prediction model New Cohort , participant treat monitored accord routine clinical practice guideline Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center .</detailed_description>
