	<brief_summary>Oxygen treatment widely use acutely ill patient . In particular , oxygen treatment routinely use acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient suspect acute myocardial infarction variably recommend ACS-guidelines , despite limit data support beneficial effect . Immediate re-opening acutely occlude infarct-related bloodvessel via primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment choice limit ischemic injury set ST-elevation ACS ( STE-ACS ) . However , sudden re-initiation blood flow achieve primary PCI give rise damage , so-called reperfusion injury . Ischemia reperfusion associate myocardial injury ( IR-injury ) involve wide range pathological process . Vascular leakage , activation cell death program , transcriptional reprogramming , reflow phenomenon innate adaptive immune activation contribute tissue damage , thereby determine infarct size . The effect oxygen treatment pathological process , extent IR-injury final infarct size STE-ACS patient previously study . ACS characterize systemic inflammation typical elevation soluble inflammatory marker well change white blood cell . The inflammatory reaction might consider helpful restore myocardial tissue structure function , hand might worsen IR-injury activate various pathological process . In human experimental study , Salmonella typhi vaccine use create standardized model systemic inflammation administer healthy volunteer vaccination associate adverse event . In ongoing register randomize multicentre clinical trial , DETO2X ( Determination role oxygen suspect acute myocardial infarction ) study , effect oxygen morbidity mortality ACS patient investigate . In substudy DETO2X-trial , investigator plan evaluate effect oxygen treatment IR-injury STE-ACS assess biomarkers reflect various aspect pathological process involve . The presented study experimental pilot study perform healthy volunteer Salmonella typhi vaccine-induced inflammation purpose study effect oxygen treatment biological system involve pathogenesis IR- injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oxygen Treatment Mechanisms Involved Ischemia-reperfusion Injury : A Pilot Study Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS The main hypothesis oxygen treatment increase oxidative stress , systemic inflammation , marker apoptosis , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) tissue inhibitor ( TIMPs ) individual subject endotoxin-induced inflammation . The investigator also hypothesize pretreatment statin prevent oxygen effect . AIMS - To evaluate whether oxygen treatment increase oxidative stress healthy volunteer subject vaccine-induced inflammation . - To assess effect oxygen treatment plasma level soluble marker apoptosis , MMPs TIMPs healthy volunteer vaccine-induced inflammation . - To study effect oxygen treatment systemic inflammatory activity leukocyte subset distribution healthy volunteer vaccine-induced inflammation . - To evaluate effect oxygen treatment platelet aggregation healthy volunteer vaccine-induced inflammation . - To determine whether potential oxygen effect cellular- biomarkers prevent pretreatment Atorvastatin . - To serve pilot study basis power calculation future plan study : `` Effects oxygen treatment biomarkers reperfusion damage infarct size ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient undergoing primary PCI '' . DESIGN The present study experimental randomize pilot study healthy volunteer . STUDY POPULATION The investigator intend include 36 healthy male volunteer . Females include , due potential risk hazardous effect Salmonella typhi vaccine Atorvastatin fetus case pregnancy . STUDY DESIGN At time inclusion study participant randomise one three intervention group : Group 1 ) Salmonella typhi vaccine Group 2 ) Salmonella typhi vaccine + oxygen treatment Group 3 ) Salmonella typhi vaccine + oxygen treatment + Atorvastatin At 8.00 study day peripheral venous catheter insert . This catheter use collect blood sample study day . In addition , peripheral oxygen saturation measure pulse oximetry . After baseline venous blood sample collect , study participant receive 0.5 mL Salmonella typhi vaccine intramuscular injection ( Typhim Vi® , Sanofi Pasteur MSD , injection solution 25 microgram/0.5 mL ) . Half hour vaccination administer , oxygen treatment initiate ( group 2 3 ) 6 L/min via Oxymask® continue 6 hour . During oxygen treatment peripheral oxygen saturation measure pulsoximetry . In group 3 , single dose Atorvastatin 80 mg give immediately prior start oxygen . Venous blood sample collect 3 , 6 8 hour baseline . After 8-hour blood sampling , peripheral venous catheter remove study day end . An experienced registered nurse resident specialist Cardiology Internal Medicine present entire study day take care study intervention , collect blood sample register data case report form ( CRF ) include potential adverse event . EFFICACY OUTCOMES - To determine effect oxygen treatment biomarkers oxidative stress , apoptosis , matrix metalloproteinases , marker inflammation platelet aggregation healthy volunteer Salmonella typhi vaccine-induced inflammation . - To compare level cellular- biomarkers time 8-hour study day . SUMMARY The present study experimental randomize pilot study perform healthy volunteer Salmonella typhi vaccine-induced inflammation purpose study date unknown effect oxygen treatment biological system involve pathogenesis IR- injury . As part DETO2X trial series , study aim contribute essential knowledge clarify role oxygen treatment acute myocardial infarction .</detailed_description>
