	<brief_summary>Despite considerable use oral steroid regular management benign vocal fold lesion little evidence base literature . This study investigate efficacy oral steroid treatment vocal fold lesion control manner . The specific aim study determine effectiveness short course oral steroid prior behavioral voice therapy patient benign , phonotraumatic vocal fold lesion . Enrolled subject randomize use random number table either receive oral steroid steroid prior initiation voice therapy . The therapist individual involve collection analysis data blind whether subject receive drug . Prior initiation therapy subject ask return interval evaluation undergo videostroboscopy voice evaluation . Subjects enter voice therapy phase . After initial evaluation determine best mode therapy receive behavioral voice therapy course , include range behavioral modification motor learn technique , along lifestyle measure . In phase acoustic aerodynamic measurement collect well audio-visual material videostroboscopic exam . The investigator hypothesize oral steroid lead reduction lesion size , substantially aid delivery incorporation voice therapy technique , contribute improvement overall laryngeal biomechanics provide ideal start point behavioral voice therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study investigate potential added advantage use steroid patient undergoing voice therapy . Enrolled subject randomize use random number table either receive oral steroid steroid prior initiation voice therapy . The therapist individual involve collection analysis data blind whether subject receive drug . Prior initiation therapy subject ask return interval evaluation undergo videostroboscopy voice evaluation . Subjects enter voice therapy phase . After initial evaluation determine best mode therapy receive behavioral voice therapy course , include range behavioral modification motor learn technique , along lifestyle measure . In phase acoustic aerodynamic measurement collect well audio-visual material videostroboscopic exam . The measurement collect phase Voice Handicap Index ( VHI ) -10 , noise harmonic ratio H/N , fundamental frequency Fo , The transglottic airflow subglottic pressure . The investigator hypothesize oral steroid lead reduction lesion size , substantially aid delivery incorporation voice therapy technique , contribute improvement overall laryngeal biomechanics provide ideal start point behavioral voice therapy .</detailed_description>
