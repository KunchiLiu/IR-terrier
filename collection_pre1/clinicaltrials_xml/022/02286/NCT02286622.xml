	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open-label , single-dose study compare PK 21 desacetyl-DFZ , data permit , deflazacort 8 subject ESRD 8 healthy match control subject ( age , body mass index [ BMI ] , gender ) . All subject ESRD hemodialysis ( HD ) . Dosing deflazacort follow PK evaluation 21 desacetyl DFZ , data permit , deflazacort , perform non-HD day . On Day 1 , schedule non-HD day subject ESRD , single oral dose deflazacort administer follow serial blood sample 24 hour assess PK 21 desacetyl-DFZ , , data permit , deflazacort . Safety monitor throughout study repeat clinical laboratory evaluation . Subjects return Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) 3 day ( ± 1 day ) follow study drug administration determine adverse event ( AEs ) occur since last study visit . Subjects terminate study early contact Principal Investigator ( PI ) deem necessary . A total sixteen ( 16 ) adult male female subject enrol . Renal Impaired Cohort : Eight ( 8 ) subject ESRD HD . Healthy Match Control Cohort : Eight ( 8 ) healthy subject estimate creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) ≥ 90 mL/min . Subjects match age [ ± 15 year ] , BMI [ ± 15 % ] , gender [ 1:1 ] subject ESRD cohort . Each subject receive single oral dose 18 mg ( 3 X 6 mg tablet ) deflazacort , follow overnight fast . Study drug administer orally approximately 240 mL water .</detailed_description>
