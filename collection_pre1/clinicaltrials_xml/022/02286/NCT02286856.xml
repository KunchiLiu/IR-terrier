Since malnutrition obesity frequently see patient , adequate nutritional intervention improve body composition function might improve quality life patient . Hypothesis / research question Hypothesis part 1 : Patients mitochondrial disorder cause m.3243 A &gt; G mutation increase risk malnutrition . Hypothesis part 2 : Intervention study : Dietary intervention adult mitochondrial disorder cause m.3243 A &gt; G mutation positive effect nutritional status , activity , hand grip strength , body composition , food intake , fatigue quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The Nijmegen Centre Metabolic Disease ( NCMD ) harbor unique research center much experience characterization group patient m3243A &gt; G mutation . For mitochondrial disease therapy available . Treatment supportive , aim improve quality life . Clinical finding patient mitochondrial disease may comprise malnutrition obesity . While nutritional intervention might constitute symptomatic treatment patient , data adult guide strategy . Malnutrition define state nutrition deficiency , excess ( imbalance ) energy , protein , nutrient cause measurable adverse effect body composition function , clinical outcome . In patient mitochondrial disease definition malnutrition cellular level due disturb metabolism energy deficit . A logical next step study effect energy shortage complaint adult population describe characteristic patient group relation nutritional status . In vein , control dietary intervention might result evidence base dietary therapy . Frequent symptoms patient OXPHOS disorder include e gastrointestinal problem , fatigue dysphagia . We suspect symptoms increase risk malnutrition . Research patient neuromuscular disorder demonstrate none patient adequate nutritional state , lower Fat Free Mass high fat percentage . Study design : Part 1 comprises comprehensive Nutritional Assessment ( NA ) include indirect calorimetry ( IC ) , bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) , anthropometry , eat report , activity measurement use actometer , completion questionnaire include Cis-fatigue SF-36 Quality life . In Part 2 2-armed randomize control intervention study perform . One group start dietary intervention whereas second group ( control ) start non-interventional period 6 month . After period dietary intervention also perform second group . The dietary intervention implies optimize diet base individually calculated energy protein requirement , remain nutrient advise line recommend daily amount ( RDA ) provide . Extended Nutritional Assessment measurement repeat every 3 month . Indirect Calorimetry perform start study . Objective study : 1 . To increase knowledge nutritional status adult patient mitochondrial disease determinant . 2 . Evaluate effect dietary intervention patient nutritional status body function ( muscle strength , activity , fatigue ) quality life . 3 . To develop criterion refer patient mitochondrial disease dietary intervention . DINAMITE study acronym DIner : Hot meal , super NA : Nutritional Assessment Nutrition + Adults MIT MITochondrial disorder E Energy</detailed_description>
