	<detailed_description>Newly diagnose myeloma patient follow 4 year . The first two year treat zoledronic acid monthly . At year 2 randomize A continue treatment 2 year B stop treatment . The primary outcome study time progressive bone disease year 2 onward . Serum bone marker measure throughout study . In patient experience progressive bone disease , development bone marker prior radiological progression investigate see could predict use serum marker During four year period patient low-dose CT superior conventional radiography make predefined time point . The secondary outcome study compare sensitivity two modality</detailed_description>
