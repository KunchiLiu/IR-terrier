Up six patient metastatic cancer participate initial open pilot study explore usability acceptability prototype application . Data qualitative interview participant use refine adapt intervention . In year two , enroll randomly assign patient anxiety metastatic cancer receive either CBT mobile app intervention online health education program . Patients self-administer intervention protocol use tablet . The target enrollment randomized-controlled trial 120 patient ( CBT Mobile App N=60 ; Control N=60 ) . Randomization stratify study site disease severity demonstrate generalizability intervention among patient diverse malignancy academic community cancer care setting .
