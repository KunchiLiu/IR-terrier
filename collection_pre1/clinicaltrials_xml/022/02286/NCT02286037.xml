Twenty-three healthy participant include randomize , two-observer , test-retest study . A highly significant positive correlation bend force polyamide filament magnitude SHA demonstrate . The `` weighted-pin '' instrument show significantly consistently large area polyamide monofilaments . The hypothesis reject : light tactile stimulus delineate large secondary hyperalgesia area stimulation rigid monofilament . The `` weighted-pin '' instrument seem alternative conventional polyamide monofilaments .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Assessments mechanical skin sensitivity include psychophysical response stimulation calibrate polyamide monofilaments . Although theoretical background application monofilaments straightforward , inconsistency method report literature . One application polyamide monofilaments assessment magnitude secondary hyperalgesia area ( SHAs ) , i.e . area normal skin near injury increase mechanical sensitivity . Secondary hyperalgesia measure central sensitization reflect effect injury central nervous system . The objective study investigate hypothesis , base previous study , light tactile stimulus delineate large SHA stimulation rigid monofilament . Method Twenty-three healthy participant include randomize , two-observer , test-retest study . The volunteer blind test-results . The design adjust examine intra-/inter-observer intra-/inter-day variability SHAs first degree burn injury induce contact thermode ( 47ºC , 7 minute , thermode area 12.5 cm2 ) low leg . The SHAs assess 45 75 min ( 15 min observer ) burn injury delineate 3 different polyamide monofilaments ( 50 , 299 , 986 mN ) `` weighted-pin '' instrument ( 512 mN ) . The test order monofilaments randomize , observer blind study result . The examination order observer Day 1 reverse Day 2 ( &gt; 6 week later ) .</detailed_description>
