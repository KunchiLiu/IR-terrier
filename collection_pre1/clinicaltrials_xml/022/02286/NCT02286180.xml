	<brief_summary>Background objective : Recently news intern doctor ' death due overload work commit suicide make authority concerned put emphasis mental health care medical staff related policy psychological intervention . The prefrontal lobe play important role work memory , executive function problem-solving ability brain . Currently , neuroimaging study investigate impact job stress prefrontal love function intern doctor . Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) measure cortical function frontotemporal region widely use biomarker aid differential diagnose major psychiatric illness Japan .
