	<detailed_description>Anxiety child undergo surgery central concern parent healthcare worker , include nurse , surgeon , anesthesiologist . It rank anesthesiologists one top five important low-morbidity anesthesia outcome ( 1 ) . Extensive research do characterizing , quantify , risk stratify anxiety group well identify multitude treatment option pharmacological nonpharmacological . Up 60 % child develop anxiety preoperative hold area anesthetic induction ( 2 ) . The incidence much high subpopulation . Preoperative anxiety attribute number cause include separation parent uncertainty anesthesia , procedure , outcome ( 3 ) . Interestingly , anxiety prior surgery effect extend intraoperative , acute recovery subacute recovery timeframes . Patients high level preoperative anxiety find require great anesthetic dosage ( 4 ) . There high incidence emergence delirium child high level preoperative anxiety ( 5 , 6 ) . These patient also high incidence postoperative pain require analgesic medication ( 7 ) . Furthermore , well document maladaptive behavioral change occur 30-54 % child two week follow surgery ( 8 ) . These include generalized anxiety , nighttime cry , enuresis , separation anxiety , temper tantrum . Twenty percent child maintain behavior 6 month 7 % persist 1 year operation ( 9 ) . High preoperative anxiety level correlate behavior change ( 2 , 5 , 8,10 ) . Many intervention try decrease anxiety vary success . Most aimed distraction . Music therapy appear therapist-dependent ( 12 ) . Hand hold video game appear help decrease anxiety , even induction ( 13 ) . Even clown operate room induction anesthesia seem help -- study concluded staff quite resistant maintain clown program ( 14 ) . Interestingly , small randomize control trial show parent distract child induction novel toy book blow bubble decrease anxiety ( 15 ) . Few study consider use tablet distraction tool child undergo surgery . Low Pittaway briefly describe use iPhoneâ„¢ distract 93 child preoperative period ( 16 ) . However , result simply anecdotal . Patel et al . describe randomized control trial use hand hold video game mean distraction compare midazolam control group . They use well validate extensively use modify Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score ( 17 ) measure anxiety level . However , study include parent present induction group , may make result difficult apply majority institution , parental presence use - institution include ( 11 ) . In addition , premedication may give 50 % patient nationally , popular among parent ( 11,18 ) . If majority practitioner use parental presence induction , preoperative education program yet widespread use half patient premedicated , leave significant portion population little intervention time separation time induction anesthesia . Finding economical , efficient mean help decrease anxiety without high dos premedication would quite appeal . This study would determine whether device would decrease anxiety child prior induction anesthesia outpatient surgery . Two hundred child age 2-12 enrolled . Half would control group , would receive standard care . Half would study group , would receive tablet device preoperative hold area would allow watch TV movie preloaded list give anesthetic gas operate room . The subject would observe outward sign anxiety score use well validate well use anxiety scale , modify Yale preoperative anxiety scale , several point time prior induction anesthesia . The expected total study length 6 month base current number pediatric case study site .</detailed_description>
