	<brief_summary>This three-arm , 1:1:1 randomize , placebo control , double- blind trial least 28 subject receive active Anti-Thymocyte Globulin Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( ATG-GCSF ) , least 28 subject receive ATG alone least 28 subject receive placebo alone within 100 day diagnosis Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) . The primary objective study determine safety ability low dose ATG plus GCSF low dose ATG alone retain/enhance C-peptide production new onset T1D patient demonstrate residual beta cell function .</brief_summary>
