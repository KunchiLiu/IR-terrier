	<brief_summary>In dose-escalation study , safety tolerability escalate dose level RRx-001 administer intravenously twice week subject brain metastasis receive whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) assess . Once maximum tolerate dose identify , ( approximately 30 ) participant recruit . The study use MRI monitor change tumor blood flow associate RRx-001 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study RRx-001 Combination With Whole Brain Radiation Subjects With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study test safety activity whole brain radiation therapy RRx-001 , experimental radiation sensitizer , participant brain metastasis . As radiation sensitizer , RRx-001 may increase effect whole brain radiation , standard care brain metastasis , cancer cell specific target area reduce damage normal healthy cell . The ability sensitize cancer cell radiation set 'domino effect ' free radical damage tumor give amount dose radiation . This study , call BRAINSTORM , since RRx-001 associate development `` free radical storm '' brain tumor , divide two stage . In first stage , approximately 3 participant time enter particular dose level RRx-001 observe order see whether dose result side effect radiation . If bad side effect observe , second group approximately 3 subject give slightly high dose RRx-001 also monitor side effect radiation . This process repeat dose reach , activity cancer cell without unacceptable side effect . At point , participant enter dose level maximum enrollment approximately 30 participant reach . RRx-001 release gas call nitric oxide , widen diameter blood vessel , allow delivery oxygen tumor . The presence oxygen tumor critical effectiveness radiation therapy , since cancer cell two three time vulnerable radiation oxygen present . The reason cancer cell much vulnerable effect radiation oxygen present radiation relies formation harmful molecule know free radical damage proteins genetic material ( DNA ) ; without oxygen low level free radical produce . Changes diameter go blood vessel study magnetic resonance imaging . Unlike chemotherapy radiation sensitizer , RRx-001 enter tumor effective nitric oxide , gas , able spread diffuse bloodstream cancer cell .</detailed_description>
