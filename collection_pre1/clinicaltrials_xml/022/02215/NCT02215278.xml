	<brief_summary>Recent iron absorption study biofortified bean indicate currently develop bean provide extra amount iron compare normal iron bean . This effect ascribe inhibitory nature phytic acid ( PA ) , present high concentration . A possible solution alleviate problem associate high PA concentration bean might low phytic acid ( lpa ) bean seed . These bean , exhibit good agronomic performance , test human absorption study Switzerland provide high amount bioavailable iron compare parent bean normal PA concentration . However , informative value study real life situation limit due simple study design relatively large amount isotopic label add extrinsically ( â‰ˆ30 % total iron ) . Furthermore , study conduct iron sufficient woman non-bean consume population . Additional investigation necessary verify iron bioavailability lpa bean high performance well compare common biofortified bean real life situation . A multiple meal randomize crossover study Rwandese woman low iron status do measure iron absorption three different bean ( lpa bean line , biofortified high iron bean , normal iron bean control ) . During study , subject receive multiple meal reduce amount extrinsic label , therefore closely simulate hypothetical dietary iron intake lpa bean . This also allow avoid overestimation effect inhibitor minimize influence intra subject day day variation . The study divide two part . In part one , two three bean variety feed part composite meal several day ( morning lunch ) part two , remain bean administer part composite meal several day ( morning lunch ) . Iron absorption three variety measure compare erythrocyte incorporation stable isotopic label 14 day test meal administration .</brief_summary>
