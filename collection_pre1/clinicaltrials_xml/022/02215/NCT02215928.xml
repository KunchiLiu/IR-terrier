	<brief_summary>This research trial study use genomic profile recommend anticancer treatment patient cancer spread beyond original site tumor ( metastatic cancer ) . Genomic profile study deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) tumor detect genetic change abnormality . This information use recommend treatment may likely result beneficial response . It yet know whether genomic profile detect abnormality use make treatment recommendation whether treatment base genomic profile effective standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility integrate tumor genomic profiling adult oncology clinic Stanford Cancer Institute . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine percentage tumor harbor `` actionable '' genomic change . II . Explore effect individual molecular profile include percent time profile change treatment . III . Determine number case genomically identify targeted therapy available . IV . Determine clinical benefit genomic base therapy , define : response rate ( accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 response criterion ) ; percent patient non-progression 4 month , overall survival , patient whose therapy select base profiling . V. Determine circulate free tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) blood stream ( liquid biopsy ) yield similar genomic result metastatic tumor analysis . VI . Determine ctDNA analysis treatment correlate RECIST 1.1 criterion predict response . OUTLINE : Tissue sample collect baseline blood liquid biopsy collect baseline every 6-8 week active treatment . Tissue sample analyze via sequence tumor genomic profiling . After completion active treatment , participant follow 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
