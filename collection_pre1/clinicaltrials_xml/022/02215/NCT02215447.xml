	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours ( NETs ) gain increase international recognition highly prevalent disease , responsive number therapy , proven , many still require high quality clinical trial evidence confirm effectiveness guide use practice . This study first prospective trial evaluate modern combination chemotherapy . Given paucity randomize study neuroendocrine carcinoma ( NECs ) , clear evidence base guideline . Patients treat accord guideline establish small cell lung cancer . Although tumor initially highly chemosensitive , natural history disease relapse occur early , ultimately lead poor prognosis . Prospective clinical trial group patient need conducted establish evidence base standard care improve prognosis . NETs heterogeneous group malignancy originate cell neural . They variable often long natural history . They commonly arise gastrointestinal tract ( 58 % ) , pancreas lung ( 27 % ) , low grade NETs associate symptom result secretion hormone vasoactive peptide . NETs use think rare recently show common rise incidence rate ( 3.3/100,000 Australia 2000-2006 ) . Prevalence ( 35/100 , 000 ) much high incidence result five year survivorship ~ 60 % result NETs prevalent either gastric , pancreatic , oesophageal hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma , 2 cancer combine . They present multiple complex clinical challenge , thereby significantly contribute cancer relate morbidity health cost Australian population . More recently , international interest group European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society identify need establish framework promote opportunity research ensure available evidence incorporate clinical practice guideline . Almost clinical trial investigate cytotoxic chemotherapy NECs small single arm study guideline derive expert opinion extrapolate result small cell lung cancer study . Most guideline recommend combination platinum compound etoposide . This combination establish standard care small cell lung cancer , another tumour neuroendocrine differentiation . However , data less clear non-pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasm ( NENs ) NECs . It strike almost publish NEC chemotherapy study non randomize include relatively small number patient often heterogeneous pathology . Although prospective study carboplatin etoposide NECs , remarkable widely accept standard chemotherapy disease . A Phase 2 multi-center trial evaluate efficacy chemotherapy paclitaxel , carboplatin etoposide advance poorly differentiate NECs show 4 cycle combination treatment , patient achieve objective response stable disease go 24 week weekly paclitaxel maintenance treatment . Of 78 patient treat , 15 % complete response overall response rate 53 % . Five patient remain disease free 18 66 month therapy . The median survival 14.5 month . However , author conclude 3 drug combination moderately toxic obvious efficacy advantage standard platinum/etoposide regimens . This year ( 2013 ASCO ) abstract single European centre report relative response 50 % retrospective series NECs use 3 weekly paclitaxel , carboplatin etoposide . NAB paclitaxel suggest achieve high intracellular tumour paclitaxel concentration via albumin mediate transendothelial transport system . Participants receive albumin-bound paclitaxel ( ABRAXANE® ) 100 mg/m2 administer intravenous infusion 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 21-day cycle . Carboplatin give Area Under Curve ( AUC ) = 5 mg/min/mL Day 1 21-day cycle administer 30 min , begin immediately completion albumin-bound paclitaxel administration . Participants continue treatment investigator 's discretion disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
