	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate drug , Pasireotide , safe effective reduce gastrointestinal side effect drug receive prepare allogeneic stem cell transplant . The study also evaluate Pasireotide effective reduce acute chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease ( GvHD ) transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasireotide Prevention GI Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design non-randomized phase II . Forty patient receive ablative preparatory regimen receive pasireotide subcutaneous ( 0.9 mg , b.i.d . ) one day prior initiation preparatory regimen continue eight day follow completion preparatory regimen exceed 14 day total dosing . We select match control exist patient take drug minimize time take complete trial . TBI fractionate four day total dose 1200 Gy . Busulfan use equivalent oral dose 4 mg/kg daily four day . These two agent combine cyclophosphamide complete preparatory regimen . GVHD prophylaxis methotrexate day +1 , +3 , +6 +11 . G-CSF use part standard care . The study collect data prior initiation drug , day 7 , day 14 weekly thereafter day 100 , standard time measure acute toxicity relate stem cell transplantation . The total day therapy record well SAE outside expect stem cell transplantation . We also follow occurrence GVHD infectious complication . Video capsule endoscopy perform subset ten study patient last day study drug administer . Patients give detailed instruction prepare procedure . An investigator blind group allocation patients/volunteers separately review image obtain capsule examination . Images examine evidence four follow type abnormality : reddened/edema/villous blunting , erosion , ulcer stenosis . Each category score 0-3 summed obtain overall index range 0 ( normal study ) 12 ( severely abnormal category ) . Citrulline assay Measurement citrulline concentration use marker cytotoxic treatment-induced intestinal damage highly reproducible . The citrulline concentration appear quantitative parameter independent underlying cause epithelial cell loss function well post-SCT setting . Five mls blood collect heparinized tube day 0 , 7 , 14 . Tubes centrifuge accord manufacturer 's instruction plasma collect stored -80C shipment laboratory perform assay . Calprotectin assay Calprotectin describe another biomarker GI injury . During radiation-induced inflammation , leucocytes infiltrate mucosa increase level fecal calprotectin . At least 50 g stool collect patient day 0 , 7 , 14 . Samples store -80C shipment laboratory perform assay . Calprotectin measure ELISA kit ( CALPRO , Oslo , Norway ) accordance manufacturer 's instruction .</detailed_description>
