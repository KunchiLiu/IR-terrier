	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic HCV Infected Egyptian Patients With Electromagnetic Waves Herbal Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To evaluate compare Efficacy Safety , extra-corporeal irradiation circulate blood extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation Selenium contain food supplement herbal tablet treatment non-cirrhotic subject chronic hepatitis C. Background Rationale : As many 150 million person chronically infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) worldwide , 350,000 die annually liver disease cause HCV Egypt confront HCV disease burden historical proportion distinguishes nation others . It high prevalence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) world , estimate nationally 14.7 % . Approximately , 10 million Egyptians carry virus . Due chronic debilitating nature , tremendous social financial impact community . Hence , trial aim find logic rational effective treatment Hepatitis C. Extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation : The wavelength UV irradiation ( UVI ) lie range 100-400 nm , subdivide UVA ( 315-400 nm ) , UVB ( 280-315 nm ) , UVC ( 100-280 nm ) .UVC UVB directly absorb DNA base cause serious DNA damage . On hand , DNA damage UVA indirect formation Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) form cellular chromophore act endogenous photo sensitizer . ROS react damage DNA , interact cell structure membrane ( lipid ) protein . All different type damage may hamper cell metabolic process , protein synthesis cell cycle progression , induce mutation cell death . Both Selenium various selenoproteins propose antioxidant effect , reduce biological impact ROS human cell . Ultraviolet blood irradiation ( UBI ) first use human early 1930s . The effectiveness UBI treat infection study extensively 1940s find UBI extremely successful treat infection peritonitis , pyelitis , sinusitis , puerperal sepsis wound infection advance cases.Later study show UBI help number patient acute viral hepatitis .Recently , Energex Systems , developer advance UBI technology , study effect UBI therapy viral load 13 patient infection show effect . Optical physical characteristic electro-magnetic irradiation narrow band ultraviolet A radiation peak 365 nm average power 18 µW/cm2 session . For irradiation UVA region ( 315 nm- 400nm ) measure average irradiance 0.12 mW/cm2in place circulate blood time session ( 40 sec ) . The time integral irradiance ( prescribed exposure dose ) 0.144 J/cm2 ( 1440 J/m2 ) total radiant exposure time 1200 sec ( 20 min ) therapeutic session ( maximum 30 session particular case ) . The Irradiance power band output wavelength ( 250 nm - 1050 nm ) optical lamp : Wavelength ( nm ) Irradiance Power ( mW/cm2 ) Ultraviolet Region A : UVA ( 315 nm -400 nm ) 0.12 mW/cm2 Visible Band : VIS ( 400 nm - 700 nm ) 110.8mW/cm2 Infrared Band : IR ( 700 nm - 1050 nm ) 28.3mW/cm2 Selenium contain herbal food supplement : No .

Asfour Liver support Detailed Description A Randomized , Open-Label , Study investigate Efficacy Safety extra-corporeal irradiation circulate blood Selenium contain herbal food supplement tablet treatment non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C subject . The null hypothesis : There difference outcome cure rate patient Hepatitis C use electromagnetic device herbal tablet contain selenium use aim treatment . This study submit ethical approval via relevant Minister health Medical military sector Research Ethics Approval Committees . Study Arm ( ) Interventions ( arm 1 ) : Twenty four daily one hour session use Extra-corporeal electro-magnetic irradiation device combine Herbal Food Supplement Selenium contain table Anti Oxidant ( Tablet A ) start 10 day radiation session continue 24 week . Intervention ( arm 2 ) : Daily Herbal Food Supplement Selenium contain tablet 24 week . What happen patient ? 1 . Invitation participate : Patients hepatitis C virus infection identify attendee hepatology tropical disease clinic institute . 2 . First Contact : Each patient receive phone call Research Nurse , request indication whether would like participate study . If patient would like meet face-to-face , case arrangement would make investigation test outpatient clinic appointment . Otherwise , question answer telephone . This phone call anticipate last 10 minute average . 3 . Initial Assessment Meeting Informed Consent : An initial meeting take place patient ask give informed consent . In addition , demographic , past medical history baseline observation note . Up-to-date base line investigation perform include : FBC , renal function , liver profile , Viral load PCR . The patient inform group randomize ( electromagnetic herbal tablet ) . Patients group detailed explanation correspond management booklet give patient take home . 4 . The Electromagnetic Device group : Those participant intervention group invite attend treatment cubicle see device . They receive 20 minute presentation theory device function . 5 . Repeated Assessment Meetings : - The Assessments perform 3 , repeat : - On discharge ( -24hrs +48hrs ) additional return normal activity question . - 4-week out-patient appointment research team clinic . - 8-week out-patient appointment research team clinic - 12-week out-patient appointment research team clinic . - 24-week out-patient appointment research team clinic . 6 . Monitoring Supportive Meetings : • The research nurse available study mobile phone support member research team period leave . 7 . End study : A final assessment meeting take place six month completion treatment . Participants discharge back hepatology clinic long term management . Research team notify long term adverse effect either treatment arm . Last follow date : 48 week baseline . Recruitment Status : Currently recruit . Supervision : 1 . The Management Monitoring Group ( MMG ) . The study manage 'Management Monitoring Group ' ( MMG ) meet regularly , throughout study , manage monitor progress . A Gantt chart show point MMG meeting propose provide within appendix . The study management also comprise 5 sub-groups ( involve specialize expert ) interact MMG . A schematic showing study management group give appendix document . The MMG comprise : - Patient Representative . - Professor Doctor : Tayseer Abdulaal , M.D. , Internal medicine , Clinical Immunology Consultant , Egyptian Military Armed Forces - Professor Doctor : Mostafa El-Awady , M.D. , Molecular Biology Consultant , Egyptian National Research Center - Professor Doctor : Mostafa El-Nakib , M.D. , Virology Consultant , Egyptian Military Armed Forces - Professor Doctor : Hala Zayed , M.D. , Internal medicine , Clinical Immunology Consultant , Egyptian Ministry Health - Professor Doctor : Ahmed El-Sawy , M.D. , Gastroenterology Consultant , Egyptian Military Armed ForcesDr 2 . The Patient Experience Sub-group The principal sub-group MMG one take responsibility manage monitoring experience patient study . This group comprise Dr Tayseer Abdulaal Research Nurses Administrator . Therefore , base within hospital . This group also responsible patient recruitment patient data entry onto appropriate database . This group make significant contribution overall management study ( do MMG ) raise awareness , within group , issue relate aspect patient experience arise study progress . 3 . The Critical side effect Sub-group A team researcher , base Egyptian military hospital , Ain Shams Cairo University hospital meet within 24 hour admission patient involve trial designate hospital . An action plan include thorough evaluation patient condition . Ife concern regard patient safety ; trial suspend assessment .</detailed_description>
