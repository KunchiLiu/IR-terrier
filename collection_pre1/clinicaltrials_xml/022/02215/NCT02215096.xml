	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , dose-finding , multicenter study design determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination orally administer Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase beta ( PI3K-beta ) inhibitor ( GSK2636771 ) enzalutamide . Subjects phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) -deficient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) receive stable dose enzalutamide recently demonstrate progression ( either RECIST [ Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ] version 1.1 , prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] progression , and/or progression bone ) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criterion enrol . Eligible subject enrol Dose-Escalation Phase determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination therapy use modify 3+3 dose escalation procedure . The safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) clinical efficacy also assess guide selection RP2D . The start dose GSK2636771 300 mg daily combination recommend dose ( 160 milligram [ mg ] daily ) oral enzalutamide . Once RP2D establish , additional subject enrol Dose Expansion Phase evaluate safety , PK preliminary clinical activity . Safety assessment perform throughout study include physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , 12 lead electrocardiogram monitor adverse event . Blood sample collect pharmacokinetic analysis . Subjects continue treatment unacceptable toxicity , disease progression , withdrawal consent death occur . A post-treatment follow-up visit perform within 30 day last dose study treatment . Xtandi register trademark Astellas Pharma Inc</brief_summary>
