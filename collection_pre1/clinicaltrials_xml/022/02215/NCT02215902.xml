	<brief_title>Safety Study Aethlon Hemopurifier</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , sequential , control feasibility/safety study subject serve his/her control . The control period week immediately precede use investigational device eligible subject undergo monitor three standard intermittent dialysis session . Vital sign , blood chemistry , hematology , liver function adverse event measure . On week two three , patient receive treatment Hemopurifier® three time per week coincident ongoing standard intermittent hemodialysis treatment . During two week , subject assess clinical parameter addition viral load determination quantitative PCR treatment Hemopurifier® . Viral load also measure follow-up prior start give subject 's hemodialysis treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Males females 18 year age old . 2 . Positive test HCV infection ( genotype ) . 3 . Endstagerenal disease ( ESRD ) require dialysis already establish HD . 4 . The arteriovenous fistula , graft central venous catheter must function adequately least 1 month entry study show sign infection blockage . 5 . Have recover toxicity prior systemic therapy . 6 . Ability tolerate blood volume loss 150 ml per week , i.e . 50 ml . 7 . Stable clinical condition , include stable hemoglobin fluctuate 1.5 2.0 gm/dl within 28 day prior enrollment study . 8 . Must follow minimum hematologic , biochemical , serologic criterion document within 28 day prior enrollment study : 1 . Hemoglobin value ≥ 9.5 gm/dL male females 2 . Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 3 . Bilirubin &lt; 4 mg/dL 4 . Albumin stable less 3.5 g/dl . 9 . Women childbearing potential must practice barrier oral contraception duration study document surgically sterile one year postmenopausal . 10 . If female , nonnursing , nonpregnant negative serum urine pregnancy test within two week start study . 11 . The subject must inform investigational nature study write informed consent obtain prior enrollment study . 12 . The subject must able comprehend study description nature feasibility study . 1 . Administration Pegasysribavirin ANY antiviral drug therapy within 90 day prior enrollment study . 2 . Administration investigational drug within 90 day prior enrollment study . 3 . Clinically significant infection , HCV , define acute chronic viral , bacterial , fungal infection , require specific therapy ( Antiinfectious therapy must complete least 14days entry study ) order make entry study possible . 4 . Patient infect human immunodeficiency virus AIDS . 5 . A history hypotensive episode dialysis lead early termination treatment 2 treatment prior start study treatment . 6 . Patients receive ACE ( angiotensin convert enzyme ) inhibitor within last 24 hour treat . Patients receive ACE inhibitor may experience anaphylactoidlike reaction , include hypotension associate flushing , dyspnea , bradycardia . Such reaction , leave untreated , may lifethreatening . The administration ACE inhibitor also associate occurrence tachycardia . Risk anaphylactoidlike reaction tachycardia may minimize temporary cessation administration ACE inhibitor 6 day longer initiate treatment protocol . 7 . Any known preexisting medical condition could interfere subject 's participation entire protocol , include serious psychiatric disorder , CNS trauma active seizure disorder require medication , poorlycontrolled diabetes mellitus indicated HbA1c &gt; 8 % within two week prior protocol initiation , significant cardiovascular dysfunction within past 6 month ( e.g. , angina , congestive heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , severe interdialytic hypotension , significant arrhythmia ) . 8 . Subjects ECG show clinically significant abnormality . 9 . Dementia cognitivelylimiting disease process would make difficult patient articulate clinical status . 10 . Prior blood transfusion reason within 3 month prior enrollment study . 11 . Recent history bleed bleeding disorder would likely require restriction use heparin study treatment . 12 . Active immunologically mediate disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease [ Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ] , rheumatoid arthritis , idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune inherit hemolytic anemia , scleroderma , severe psoriasis ) . 13 . Any medical condition requiring , likely require course study , chronic systemic administration steroid immunoregulatory medication . 14 . Substance abuse , alcohol ( ~80 gm/day ) , IV drug , inhale drug ( If subject history substance abuse , consider inclusion protocol , subject must abstain use abused substance least 2 month . Subjects receive methadone within past year also exclude . ) 15 . Any cancer require systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy . 16 . Any condition , opinion Principal Investigators , would make subject unsuitable enrollment , could interfere subject participate complete protocol .</criteria>
