	<brief_summary>This open-label evaluation safety , tolerability immunogenicity efficacy PfSPZ Vaccine administer Direct Venous Inoculation ( DVI ) healthy , malaria-naïve subject . There 3 group total 69 subject ( 45 immunize subject 24 infectivity control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial PfSPZ Vaccine Administered Direct Venous Inoculation Healthy Malaria-Naïve Adults : Heterologous vs. Homologous Controlled Human Malaria Infection Reduction Number Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 1 ( n=15 ) Group 2 ( n = 15 ) subject receive five dos DVI 2.7 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose ( 4 dos 4 week interval 5th dose 8 week fourth dose ) . Group 3 ( n = 15 ) receive 3 dos DVI 4 . 5 x 10^5 PfSPZ/dose 8 week interval . Subjects complete immunization receive total 13.5 x 10^5 PfSPZ . Protective efficacy assess Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( CHMI ) exposure bite five Pf-infected mosquito . Groups 1 3 ( n = 30 ) undergo two CHMIs time mosquito infect PfSPZ ( 3D7 ) ( homologous ) along 6 Infectivity Controls . Group 2 undergo two CHMIs separately mosquitoes infected PfSPZ ( 7G8 ) ( heterologous ) along 6 Infectivity Controls . CHMI occur approximately 2 3 week 24 week final immunization . Subjects may proceed CHMI provide receive few three schedule immunization . Immunized subject may participate second CHMI whether protect first CHMI ; boost immune response CHMI # 1 may lead protection CHMI # 2 . One subject Groups 1 2 3 subject Group 3 immunize approximately 24 hour prior rest group ( refer `` pilot subject '' ) . For Group1/Group 2 pilot subject : first subject immunize observed site minimum one hour ; point , second subject may immunize he/she also observe minimum one hour . For Group 3 : three subject immunize sequentially minimum 2 hour observation period subject ( two hour observation third subject well ) . If safety concern identify pilot subject 24 hour trigger stop rule , rest subject Groups 1 , 2 3 immunize schedule . Subjects Group 3 receive first immunization approximately 4 week subject Groups 1 2 receive first immunization . Subjects follow 8 week last CHMI safety purpose .</detailed_description>

Receipt three vaccine within 60 day prior screen visit , plan receive three vaccine within 1 month follow participation study . Personal beliefs prohibit receive vaccine product contain human serum albumin within diluent ( vaccine recipient ) . Use plan use drug antimalarial activity would coincide period immunization CHMI . History psoriasis porphyria , may exacerbate treatment chloroquine . Anticipated use medication know cause drug reaction chloroquine , atovaquoneproguanil ( Malarone® ) , artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem® ) cimetidine , metoclopramide , antacid , kaolin . History illness condition , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation protocol compromise scientific objective .</criteria>
