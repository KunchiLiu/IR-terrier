	<brief_summary>Abiraterone acetate consider standard care patient metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) pre-chemotherapy setting . Patients primary acquire abiraterone resistance typically rapidly progressive , refractory disease limit treatment option available . The development new therapy mCRPC require focus patient primary acquire resistance abiraterone . Patients abiraterone-refractory mCRPC poor prognosis overall median survival progression disease approximately 19 month . While chemotherapy standard approach setting , refuse many patient clinician due toxicity concern . Selinexor first class Selective Inhibitor Nuclear Export ( SINE ) specifically block karyopherin protein Exportin 1 ( XPO1/Exportin 1 ) . XPO1 key regulatory protein responsible nuclear export lead functional inactivation tumor suppressor protein ( TSPs ) up-regulated 2-4 fold cancer study date . Selinexor , give orally , demonstrate potent anti-cancer activity animal model prostate cancer include inhibition PC3 drive bone metastasis.The goal trial evaluate potential progression free survival benefit associate Selinexor administration patient abiraterone-refractory mCRPC . Single agent phase II open label study Selinexor patient mCRPC prior therapy standard hormone ablation agent abiraterone . A maximum 54 evaluable patient accrue study , provide early stopping criterion meet . The start dose patient oral dose 65 mg/m2 , give twice per week least 48 hour apart . Tablets Selinexor oral administration supply two ( 2 ) strength : 10 25 mg active ingredient per tablet . Dexamethasone coadministered dose 2 mg twice daily day dose day . Patients follow 30 day completion treatment removal study , death , whichever occur first . Patients remove study unacceptable treatment related adverse event ( ) follow resolution stabilization treatment related adverse event Grade 2 low .</brief_summary>
