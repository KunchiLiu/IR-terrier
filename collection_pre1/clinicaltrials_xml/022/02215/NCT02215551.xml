	<brief_summary>Decompressive laminectomy ( DL ) common type back surgery perform old adult ; DL treat lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) , degenerative narrow spinal canal cause pain trouble walking . An estimated one three people undergo DL get well often undergo repeat surgery.1,3-6 Some study indicate condition outside spine ( e.g. , depression , hip arthritis ) cause people undergo DL poorly,27,30-36 one comprehensively examined condition impact treat DL outcome . Thus LSS treatment continue focus spine alone.61 The aim study identify condition LSS place Veterans risk poor DL outcomes future comparative effectiveness study design examine impact comprehensive approach treatment . Investigators believe patient-centered rather disease-centered approach lead superior outcome , less suffering , appropriate use health care resource .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim 6-site prospective cohort study develop algorithms usable clinical set predict decompressive laminectomy ( DL ) outcomes ( i.e. , success vs. failure ) old adult lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) , common indication spine surgery old patient . The clinical algorithm develop base primarily factor outside LSS important aging-related predictor pain disability ( e.g. , hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) , fibromyalgia syndrome , depression , anxiety , fear-avoidance belief , dysfunctional coping ) . Preliminary data support impact factor DL outcome , study include comprehensive assessment rigorously collect data context prospective cohort . Thus LSS treatment remain focused exclusively lumbar spine treatment outcomes suboptimal , average , &lt; 20 % reduction pain . An estimated one three DL patient improve . Further , anatomical evidence LSS ( i.e. , base advanced imaging ) exist many old patient without pain functional compromise . Two hundred fifty patient symptomatic LSS schedule undergo DL without fusion dementia , spinal instability , prior lumbar surgery recruit spine surgery practice 6 participate site ( VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System , Durham VA Medical Center [ MC ] , Richmond VAMC , Ann Arbor VAMC , Denver VAMC , San Antonio VAMC ) . Within 30 day prior DL ( i.e. , baseline ) , participant undergo comprehensive rigorous assessment pain disability-generating factor include : 1 ) SS symptom Brigham Spinal Stenosis questionnaire ( BSS , specific available LSS measurement tool ) ; 2 ) musculoskeletal comorbidities ( scoliosis , kyphosis , hip osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia symptom , severity spinal stenosis , degenerative disc facet disease ) ; 3 ) mood ( depression [ Centre Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) ] , anxiety [ GAD-7 ] ) ; 4 ) cognitive function ( normal vs. mild cognitive impairment computer-based assessment mild cognitive impairment ) ; 5 ) psychological function ( fear-avoidance belief [ Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ] , chronic pain self-efficacy [ Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scales ] , dysfunctional pain cop skill [ Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire ] , treatment expectancy , illicit substance use , alcohol use , smoke status , PTSD symptom ) ; 6 ) medical comorbidity ( include BMI ) ; 7 ) demographic factor ( age , gender , race , educational/marital status ) . The BSS collect baseline , first postoperative visit , every 3 month one year . Prediction rule , base comprehensive set factor measure DL success/failure determine BSS , create use multiple method maximize predictive accuracy validate subsequently separate cohort 100 individual . Investigators apply rule future comparative effectiveness trial test personalize LSS treatment approach ( i.e. , involve target extra-LSS factor part total treatment package ) compare DL alone . An exploratory aim propose study evaluate use Goal Attainment Scaling ( GAS ) DL outcome . This patient-centered outcome measurement approach use commonly rehabilitation setting , never DL patient . To prepare future comparative effectiveness trial , investigator want develop GAS outcome measure use track outcome SS patient across surgical non-surgical intervention , investigator anticipate employ part personalize treatment . Investigators explore ( 10-12 patient interview ) refine ( modify Delphi panel expert ) GAS goal patient SS , measure goal achievement subset 20 participant . What might happen old adult LSS treat context comprehensive pre-operative program undergoing DL ? Might long-term outcome associate DL improve ? Might patient satisfaction improve ? Might patient avoid DL ? These question ultimately investigator hope answer .</detailed_description>
