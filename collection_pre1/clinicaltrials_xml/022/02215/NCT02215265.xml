	<brief_summary>The main objective PATHOS study : To assess whether swallow function improve following transoral resection HPV-positive OPSCC , reduce intensity adjuvant treatment protocol . The aim personalise treatment , base disease biology ( HPV status pathology finding ) , optimise patient outcome . To demonstrate feasibility recruitment- phase II recruit successfully , PATHOS continue Phase III study aim show non-inferiority survival reduce intensity treatment arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-operative Adjuvant Treatment HPV-positive Tumours ( PATHOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PATHOS multicentre , open label , parallel group Phase II/III randomise control trial ( RCT ) . Approximately 242 patient recruit phase II study . Patients eligible study must biopsy proven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) clinically stag T1T3 N0N2b . Their primary tumour , judge local MDT , must consider resectable via transoral approach . Having secure informed consent , patient centrally determine , HPVpositive tumours undergo baseline assessment swallow function ( includesÍ¾ MDADI score , videofluoroscopy , PSSH &amp; N , 100 mL water swallow test ) complete QOL question ( EORTC QLQC30 EORTC QLQH &amp; N35 ) prior surgery . Surgery primary site may carry Transoral Laser Microsurgery ( TLM ) Transoral Robotic Surgery ( TORS ) , whilst standard open approach use facilitate associate neck dissection . Following surgery histopathological assessment primary tumour neck dissection surgical specimen , patient allocate study group base presence absence pathological risk factor recurrence follow : Group A : Patients tumours exhibit adverse histological feature . Patients group receive adjuvant treatment per standard care . Group B : Patients : T3 tumour ( T1T2 tumours additional risk factor ) , N2a ( metastasis single ipsilateral node 31-60 mm diameter ) N2b ( metastasis multiple ipsilateral node &lt; 61 mm diameter ) disease evidence perineural and/or vascular invasion close margin ( 15mm ) around primary tumour specimen negative marginal biopsy ( section 7.1 ) . Patients group randomise : PORT 60Gy 30 # 6 week ( Control Arm B1 ) PORT 50Gy 25 # 5 week ( Test Arm B2 ) . Group C : Patients tumours T N stage , exhibit follow high risk pathological feature include : positive ( &lt; 1mm ) margin around primary tumour specimen negative marginal biopsy and/or evidence cervical lymph node extracapsular spread . Patients group randomise : POCRT 60Gy 30 # 6 week concurrent Cisplatin ( Control Arm C1 ) PORT 60Gy 30 # 6 week ( Test Arm C2 ) . Patients group B C stratify prior randomisation : T stage , N stage , smoke history treat centre . The assessment baseline complete post operatively prior treatment four week 6 , 12 24 month post treatment . The exception videofluoroscopy repeat post-surgery 12 month . Acute late toxicity record weekly treatment 4 week 6 , 12 24 month post treatment . The time point assessment record CRF . Complications relate surgery record CRF . In particular complication necessitate delay start adjuvant treatment . The Phase II study , successful demonstrate swallow function advantage experimental arm , continue seamlessly onto phase III study , primary endpoint overall survival , aim prove survival noninferiority reduce intensity treatment arm . In order demonstrate survival noninferiority , &gt; 800 patient total need recruit . The phase II act internal pilot recruit patient include phase III study . Data registry : The top copy complete CRF return WCTU data entry within four week visit . The remain copy retain local site . In accordance principle GCP , PI responsible ensure accuracy , completeness , legibility timeliness data report WCTU CRFs.CRF page data receive WCTU participate trial site check miss , illegible unusual value ( range check ) consistency time . If miss questionable data identify , data query raise data clarification form . The data clarification form send relevant participate site . The site shall request answer data query correct data data clarification form . The CRF page alter . All answer data query correction sign date delegated member staff relevant participate site . The complete data clarification form return WCTU copy retain site along participant ' CRFs . The WCTU send reminder overdue data . It site 's responsibility submit complete accurate data timely manner . Quality assirance : The clinical trial risk assessment use determine intensity focus central on-site monitoring activity PATHOS trial . Monitoring level employ fully document trial monitoring plan . Investigators agree allow trial related monitoring , include audit regulatory inspection , provide direct access source data/documents require . Patient consent obtain . Registration : To register randomise patient relevant registration randomisation case report form ( CRF ) complete Wales Clinical Trials Unit ( WCTU ) contact . Randomisation take place centrally confirmation eligibility , telephone call WCTU . Participants randomise use minimisation random element . This ensure balanced treatment allocation number clinically important stratification factor . Randomisation allocation ratio 1:1 . Statistical analysis : We compare mean MDADI score 12 month arm use either t-test nonparametric method appropriate depend upon distribution . We expect baseline MDADI value high adjust randomisation stratification variables additional sensitivity analyse use regression technique . This primary analysis conduct last patient 12 month assessment . A detailed statistical analysis plan develop analysis conduct . An IDMC review accumulate data ( survival , toxicity , recruitment ) 6 monthly interval ( see section 13.1 ) . Additionally , use similar method CTAAC fund PARSPORT trial ( CRUK/03/005 ) , formal interim analysis perform 38 patient randomise randomisation ( 19 per arm ) , treat follow 6 month . Within randomisation , stop rule base observe absolute observe difference 6 loco-regional recurrence and/or death reason consider early termination trial . However , IDMC also ask take account available data source likely influence clinical practice recommend early closure trial . Once 12 month follow- data accumulate answer Phase II question , IDMC convene recommend either continue Phase III stop recruitment . In make decision consider primary secondary endpoint data . Sub-group statistical analysis : For swallow endpoint , subgroup analysis T stage tumour subsite ( tonsil , soft palate , tongue base ) carry , likely relevant clinical co-variables affect swallow function . Exploratory analysis may conduct aid hypothesis generation phase III subsequently develop .</detailed_description>
