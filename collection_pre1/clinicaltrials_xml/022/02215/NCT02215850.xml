	<brief_summary>SLC-0111 selective , small molecule , inhibitor carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) IX development treatment solid tumour over-expressing CA IX . CAIX , transmembrane metalloenzyme , overexpressed extracellular surface hypoxic tumour cell expression highly restrict normal tissue . CAIX functional regulator process critical tumour growth metastasis , include pH regulation , survival , migration invasion . This prospective single arm study evaluate safety SLC-0111 give daily 28 day cycle subject advance solid tumour . The intent research study find information : high dose SLC-0111 give safely , side effect may cause , examine body affect study drug concentration blood ( pharmacokinetics PK ) , gain information effectiveness treat cancer .</brief_summary>
