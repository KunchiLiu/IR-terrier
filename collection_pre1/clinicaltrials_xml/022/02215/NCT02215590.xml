	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Test walk functionality people follow Acquired brain injury ( ABI ) 2 . Suggesting new treatment walk impairment 3 . Follow-up motor learn ability balance intervention within population The investigator intend target dynamic stability gait ABI , group individual ABI persistent balance mobility deficit despite able walk independently high score standard clinical balance measure . Interventions : Training Re-Step system shoe . In study control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-Step : Dynamic Balance Treatment Gait Acquired Brain Injury ( ABI ) Victims</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Type research : Prospective , exploratory , clinical , interventional trial Specific objectives : To explore efficacy Re-step rehabilitation technology improve dynamic balance gait people Acquired Brain Injury ( ABI ) . The investigator suggest new technology intervention induce unexpected change underfoot slope , Re-Step shoe , walk force central nervous system ( CNS ) react solve walk problem real time . The investigator propose new approach significantly motor function improvement balance gait , transfer real environmental setting retain long periods time . Research method : Subjects : A total 60 subject ABI victim study one treatment group-Re-Step shoe walk training Time flow protocol : Telephone call patient rehabilitation clinic call participation paper Recruiting subject accord inclusion/exclusion criterion , medical examination consent subject Tests measure ( see outcome measure ) apply measure change - TO - start intervention form base line - T1 - 20 session intensive treatment 60 min , 2-3 session week . For subject 10-12 week treatment . - T2 - 6 month T1 , period normal daily schedule subject , intervention , check retain train result . For subject 10-12 week treatment . The treatment start week T0 ; T1 perform week training complete ; T2 perform 6 month ( take leave 2 week ) T1 . The recruitment training participant go accord availability facility 24 month .</detailed_description>
