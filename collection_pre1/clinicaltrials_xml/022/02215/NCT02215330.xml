A new , non-destructive therpeutical concept oral use eplerenone mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist . It currently use treatment hypertension congestive heart failure . In recent literature show eplerenone improve CSC serious adverse effect observe case . However , randomise control study perform compare eplerenone placebo evaluate clinical effect . Aim randomise control double-masked study compare treatment effect eplerenone versus placebo patient acute chronic CSC untreated observational period least 2 month . If sign clinical improvement within first 16 week onset symptom , patient offer half-fluence PDT . In small case series , eplerenone show valuable therapeutical option patient suffer CSC , randomise study available . The oral application well tolerated patient severe side effect occur . The common side effect eplerenone hyperkalemia make close monitoring individual diabetes mellitus renal disease necessary . In study , blood test accord standard eplerenone perform patient . Additionally , patient study see examine internal medicine specialist sub-specialized endocrinology prior treatment entire duration study . Patients suffer CSC include study either receive eplerenone placebo tablet . The treatment start 2 month recognition first symptoms early . Therefore , patient acute CSC miss treatment , usual `` treatment '' phase observation . Patients eplerenone group may benefit take part study , whereas patient control group undergo standard treatment ( =observation ) . Our current treatment protocol perform half-fluence PDT approximately 4 month onset symptom . All patient improve within time period offer receive half-fluence PDT . In case chronic CSC , onset symptom diagnosis 2 month duration , eplerenone placebo nevertheless offer mentioned treatment period 2 month rescue therapy option half-fluence PDT case sign positive treatment effect within 4 month eplerenone therapy .</detailed_description>
