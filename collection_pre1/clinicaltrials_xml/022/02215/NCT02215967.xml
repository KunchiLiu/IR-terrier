	<brief_title>Study T Cells Targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Multiple myeloma ( MM ) malignancy plasma cell . - MM nearly always incurable . - T cell genetically modify express chimeric antigen receptor ( CARs ) specifically target malignancy-associated antigen . - Autologous T cell genetically modify express CARs target B-cell antigen CD19 cause complete remission small number patient leukemia lymphoma . These result demonstrate CAR-expressing T cell anti-malignancy activity human . - B-cell maturation antigen ( BCMA ) protein express normal plasma cell malignant plasma cell multiple myeloma . - BCMA express normal cell except plasma cell mature B cell . - We construct anti-BCMA CAR specifically recognize BCMA-expressing target cell vitro eradicate BCMA-expressing tumor mouse . - Anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cell previously test human . - We hypothesize anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cell specifically eliminate BCMA-expressing MM cell patient -Possible toxicity include cytokine-associated toxicity fever , hypotension , neurological toxicity . Elimination normal plasma cell unknown toxicity also possible . OBJECTIVES : Primary -Determine safety feasibility administer T cell express anti- BCMA CAR patient MM . Secondary - Evaluate vivo persistence anti-BCMA CAR T cell - Assess evidence anti-myeloma activity anti-BCMA CAR T cell ELIGIBILITY - Patients must measurable MM define serum M-protein great equal 4 g/dL urine M-protein great equal 200 mg/24 hour involve serum free light chain ( FLC ) level great equal 10 mg/dL ( provide FLC ratio abnormal ) biopsy-proven plasmacytoma . - Patients must previously receive least 3 different treatment regimen MM . - Patients must normal creatinine normal cardiac ejection fraction . - An ECOG performance status 0 -2 require . - Patients anticoagulant medication except aspirin eligible . - No active infection allow . - Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1000/ L , platelet count great equal 45,000/ L , hemoglobin great equal 8g/dL - ALT AST less equal 2.5-fold high upper limit normal - At least 14 day must elapse time prior systemic treatment ( include corticosteroid ) require leukapheresis . - At least 14 day must elapse time prior systemic treatment ( include corticosteroid ) initiation protocol treatment . - Bone marrow plasma cell must 30 % less total bone marrow cell 30 day less prior start protocol treatment . - The patient MM need assess BCMA expression flow cytometry immunohistochemistry perform NIH . If unstained , paraffinembedded bone marrow plasmacytoma section available prior biopsy , use determine BCMA expression immunohistochemistry ; otherwise patient need come NIH bone marrow biopsy biopsy plasmacytoma determine BCMA expression . The sample BCMA expression come biopsy obtain time enrollment . DESIGN : - This phase I dose-escalation trial - Patients undergo leukapheresis - T-cells obtain leukapheresis genetically modify express anti- BCMA CAR - Patients receive lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy condition regimen intent enhance activity infuse anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cell . - The chemotherapy condition regimen cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 daily 3 day fludarabine 30 mg/m2 daily 3 day . Fludarabine give day cyclophosphamide . - Two day chemotherapy end , patient receive infusion anti- BCMA-CAR-expressing T cell . - The initial dose level dose-escalation trial 0.3x106 CAR+ T cells/kg recipient bodyweight . - The cell dose administer escalated maximum tolerate dose determined patient le 50 % total bone marrow cell plasma cell . With Amendment C , patient 50 % great bone marrow plasma cell receive 3x10 ( 6 ) anti-BCMA CAR T cells/kg . - Following T-cell infusion , mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization monitor toxicity . - Outpatient follow-up plan 2 week , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month CAR T-cell infusion . - Repeat treatment possible patient residual MM great grade 2 toxicity initial treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 2.1.1.1 Multiple Myeloma criterion Clear BCMA expression must detect great 50 % malignant plasma cell either bone marrow plasmacytoma flow cytometry immunohistochemistry . These assay must perform National Institutes Health . It require specimen use BCMA determination come sample obtained patient recent treatment . BCMA expression need document majority malignant plasma cell time original antiBCMA CAR Tcell infusion patient undergoing second antiBCMA CAR Tcell infusion . If paraffin embed unstained sample bone marrow involve MM plasmacytoma available , ship NIH BCMA staining , otherwise new biopsy need perform determination BCMA expression . Bone marrow plasma cell must make 30 % less total bone marrow cell base bone marrow biopsy perform within 30 day start protocol treatment . Patients must receive least 3 different prior treatment regimens multiple myeloma Patients must measurable MM define least one criterion . . One abnormalities define measurable disease : Serum Mprotein great equal 1 g/dl ( 10 g/l ) . Urine Mprotein great equal 200 mg/24 h. Serum free light chain ( FLC ) assay : involve FLC level great equal to10 mg/dl ( 100 mg/l ) provide serum FLC ratio abnormal .
