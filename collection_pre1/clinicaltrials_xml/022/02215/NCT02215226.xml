	<detailed_description>Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) lead cause invasive disease neonatal period develop develop country . The global incidence disease 0.53 per 1000 live birth , though substantially high incidence report South Africa ( 3 per 1000 live birth ) . Of disease-causing serotypes , type Ia III account 70 % invasive disease young infant . The introduction screen maternal rectovaginal GBS colonization , subsequent treatment colonize woman intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis ( IAP ) delivery , lead &gt; 80 % reduction incidence disease setting ( Schrag , 2012 ) . However , residual burden early-onset disease ( EOD ) country implement universal screen IAP remain similar incidence late-onset disease ( LOD ) , decline time . The resource necessary implement screen IAP program limit establishment intervention develop develop country . GBS capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ( GBS-CV ) aim immunization pregnant woman , protection newborn expect trans-placental acquisition induce antibody utero develop . There number challenge undertake large efficacy trial GBS-CV aim licensure vaccine . Consequently , licensure GBS-CV may depend establish immunologic/serologic correlate protection invasive disease newborn , successfully motivate adopted licensure pathway meningococcal vaccine . Although previous study aim identify serotype-specific correlate anticapsular antibody protection invasive GBS disease early-infancy ; difference study-design , age-range invasive-cases , antibody assay method lack standardized reference serum test mean robust sero-correlate protection GBS yet identify . We propose conduct case control study nest within prospective , longitudinal cohort mother infant &lt; =90 day age , one academic hospital center South Africa . The limited intrapartum antibiotic exposure ( 10-12 % delivery ) , relatively high incidence EOD LOD ( 2 per 1000 live birth 1 per 1000 live birth respectively ) standardize laboratory surveillance ( case identification ) offer optimal set establish correlate protection GBS serotypes predominate setting ( serotypes Ia III EOD serotype III LOD ) .</detailed_description>
