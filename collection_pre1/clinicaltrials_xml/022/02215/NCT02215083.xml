	<brief_title>L-glutamine Supplementation Alleviate Symptoms Taxane-Induced Neuropathy Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>L-glutamine previously show help reduce incidence numbness tingle patient breast cancer receive taxane chemotherapy . However , study date look effect l-glutamine give numbness tingling ( call 'perihperhal neuropathy ' ) already occur . We hypothesize administration amino acid l-glutamine naïve patient result measureable reduction taxane-induced neuropathy .</detailed_description>
