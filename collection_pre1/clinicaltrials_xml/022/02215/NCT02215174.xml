	<brief_summary>Statins first-line commonly prescribe drug prevention cardiovascular disease stroke world . Our preliminary study suggest Caucasians might high risk develop potentially life-threatening drug-drug interaction Asians take statin . Drug-drug interaction occur body two drug interact way alters effectiveness and/or toxicity . These interaction become increasingly severe problem statin usage since patient high risk cardiovascular disease also take statin combine many drug , antihypertensive diabetic drug . Our study aim understanding molecular factor provide sound basis interethnic dosage response difference statin . Drug-transporting protein intestine liver tissue responsible take statin blood . It hypothesize interethnic function difference proteins account difference statin blood level Caucasians Asians frequency and/or severity respective drug-drug interaction . A clinical study conduct Caucasian Asian subject undergo gastric bypass surgery excess intestine liver tissue acquire part standard procedure . Protein level quantify tissue correlate different statin blood level .</brief_summary>
