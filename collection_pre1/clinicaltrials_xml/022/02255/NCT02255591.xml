	<brief_summary>The main objective trial complete double-blinded randomize control trial lumbar plexus block Shamrock technique versus Lumbar Ultrasound Trident technique estimate time performance lumbar plexus block healthy volunteer . Secondary objective include ) estimate number depth needle injection , distance injection site midline , minimal electric nerve stimulation trigger muscular response type response , volunteer discomfort block injection , b ) measurement plasma lidocaine mean arterial blood pressure , c ) examination sensory block dermatome T8-S3 motor block femoral nerve , obturator nerve , hip abductor muscle , hamstring muscle , ) success rate lumbar plexus block , e ) perineural epidural distribution local anesthetic add contrast visualized magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning , f ) cost-effectiveness Shamrock technique versus Lumbar Ultrasound Trident Technique lumbar plexus block healthy volunteer . The hypothesis Shamrock technique faster perform Lumbar Ultrasound technique , success rate Shamrock technique equal high Lumbar Ultrasound Trident technique .</brief_summary>
