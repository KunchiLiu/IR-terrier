	<brief_title>Development Optimal Approach Return Results Families Undergoing Next-generation Sequencing Prenatal Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although whole exome sequencing ( WES ) first use identification genetic cause disease 2009 whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) 2010 , question remain performance clinical test , already offer patient doctor clinical test several laboratory certify US government ( 14 lab WES 5 lab WGS ) . The result WES WGS complex confusing , even doctor scientist work technology daily basis ; patient , process decide whether WES WGS testing , undergo testing , receive result , try use result decision-making could quite stressful . Currently , process occurs unstandardized fashion , patient receive extensive education counseling , others receive almost none . There critical need identify patient need desire area , develop strategy satisfy . The primary goal project gain knowledge patient undergoing prenatal diagnosis fetal abnormality understand react WGS testing , develop ethical responsible approach patient education , counseling , return result patient . In order , need evaluate parent ' understanding utility limitation technology , parent ' preference regard type result want receive , psychological impact receive result technology . We enroll 30 family consist woman carry fetus major abnormality identify ultrasound , father fetus , opt amniocentesis standard prenatal diagnostic testing ( karyotyping , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) and/or microarray testing ) . Half family serve control , standard prenatal diagnostic testing . For half family , WGS perform addition standard diagnostic testing . For 30 case , perform psychosocial evaluation ( include assessment subject ' mood , understand technology preference return result ) time enrollment , time return CLIA-certified genetic testing result ( karyotype , FISH , microarray , and/or WGS ) , completion pregnancy . In way , learn whether participant receive adequate education next-generation sequence make informed choice , range preference return result prenatal population ( whether change new method prenatal diagnosis employ ) , whether use WGS impose additional psychological stress compare standard prenatal diagnostic test . This study carry stepwise carefully monitor environment , progress overseen Independent Data Monitoring Committee order maximize knowledge gain minimize potential harm .</detailed_description>
