	<brief_summary>This Phase IV study design evaluate rate Surgical Site Infections ( SSIs ) IrriSept device use open abdominal laparotomy abdominal trauma acute surgical abdomen . Half eligible subject randomize receive IrriSept device half subject receive respective institution 's Standard Care ( SoC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IRR-CT-901-2013-01 Phase IV , multi-center , prospective , randomize , control , comparator clinical trial . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase typically perform Emergency Department , randomize , open-label Treatment ( Perioperative ) Phase , End Study , 30-day Follow-up . Medical Centers throughout United States participate research site , enrol eligible subject 18 year age old undergo open abdominal laparotomy abdominal trauma acute surgical abdomen . Subjects randomize 1 - 1 ratio receive IrriSept irrigation device institution 's Standard Care ( SoC ) prior abdominal surgery . Exclusion criterion include : know allergy chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) , Abbreviated Injury Scale ( AIS ) score six ( 6 ) , American Society Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification ( ASA ) score five ( 5 ) great , female subject pregnant and/or breast feeding , patient undergoing damage control laparotomy , abdominal incision create prior operate room , patient enrol concurrent , ongoing interventional , randomized clinical trial . Patient risk factor assess screen include chronic uncontrolled hypertension , chronic heart disease , chronic renal disease , chronic pulmonary disease , diabetes mellitus , HIV , chronic liver disease , BMI less 18 40 , coagulopathy , current long-term steroid use , current smoker , current cancer . Additional assessment include PATI ( Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index ) , AIS ASA score , adherence SCIP prophylactic antibiotic-specific guideline . Other measure document include antibiotic usage surgical skin preparation . The follow `` present admission '' ( PoA ) characteristic collect : shock , ( systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg ) , intubation , active infection , transfusion blood/blood product primary injury trauma primary organ ( ) acute abdomen . Intra-operative SSI risk factor include drain , staple versus suture , surgical time ( skin skin ) , blood/blood product , body temperature 36 degree Celsius also evaluate risk adjust final analysis . Exploratory endpoint study completion include : infection ( superficial , deep , organ space ) , ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) , catheter associate urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) , central line associate blood stream infection ( CLABSI ) , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolus ( PE ) , acute cardiac event , Clostridium difficile ( C-diff ) infection , MRSA infection , mortality length stay ( LOS ) . The Standard Care ( SoC ) arm subject receive routine surgical Standard Care ( SoC ) . It note routine SoC sole discretion investigator institution may may involve surgical wound irrigation . If irrigation use , deliver bulb syringe pour method pressure device , range syringe cannula jet lavage . While primary objective research involve surgical site infection , hospital readmission rate , hospital cost , length hospital stay also compare two study arm secondary objective .</detailed_description>
