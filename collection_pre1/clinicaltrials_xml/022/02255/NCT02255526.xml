	<brief_summary>This project compare BodyGuardian ( BG ) device measurement breathe activity level gold standard measurement technique gas exchange use mouthpiece connect flow gas analyzer measure breathe metabolic rate ( indirect calorimetry ) activity , We hopeful comparison help u improve upon measurement make current version BG device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BodyGuardian Respiration Activity Validation Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BodyGuardian remote monitoring system FDA 510 clear device use perform remote monitoring cardiac patient . BodyGuardian ( BG ) novel remote care platform . It incorporate adhesive strip sensor in-built electrode attach rechargeable module determine ECG signal bio impedance . The module also 3-way accelerometer . ECG , physical activity respiration assess use sensor . Although ECG data reliable , doubt regard clinical meaning validity activity respiration data . The BG report respiration rate activity level ( scale 0 100 ) . This data use input clinical algorithm include onboard ECG arrhythmia detection well clinical care algorithms heart failure decompensation prediction . Respiration data uniformly report still doubt regard validity . BG breathe measurement compare gold standard measurement technique gas exchange use mouthpiece connect flow gas analyzer . Activity data report investigator know value translate clinically use objective parameter activity e.g . METS . BG activity measurement compare gold standard activity measurement use metabolic rate ( indirect calorimetry )</detailed_description>
