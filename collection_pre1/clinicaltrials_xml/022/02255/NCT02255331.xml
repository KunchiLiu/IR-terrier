	<brief_summary>Patients total hip replacement may require early revision surgery due adverse local tissue reaction bone resorption occur due wear debris release implant . A non-invasive imaging biomarker exist identify follow total hip replacement patient risk suffer type premature implant failure . This study evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) biomarker predict fail hip replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarker For Adverse Local Tissue Reaction In Individuals With Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) metal-on-polyethylene ( MOP ) bearing material excellent survival rate common cause implant failure aseptic loosening cause biologic reaction wear debris . Alternative bearing surface , ceramic metal , develop alternative MOP reduce osteolysis due polyethylene wear . The use metal-on-metal ( MOM ) hip resurface arthroplasty ( HRA ) implant initially advocate due perceive advantage MOP ; however , reaction MOM wear debris expand capsule become common cause premature implant failure due adverse local tissue reaction . Furthermore , monitor local response implant require high soft tissue contrast , adverse reaction generate host synovial response . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) superior soft tissue contrast traditionally limited artifact generate component . In study , investigator propose develop MRI biomarker detect adverse local tissue reaction bear combination modular connection THA . Individuals indicate revision THA surgery recruit pre-operative MRI study , intra-operative tissue sample histologic analysis , post-operative wear analysis retrieve implant . Correlations MRI datasets histologic wear assessment perform use develop predictive diagnostic tool management THA patient . This predictive tool apply cohort individual primary THA longitudinally monitor disease progression patient different individual risk factor implant bearing surface .</detailed_description>
