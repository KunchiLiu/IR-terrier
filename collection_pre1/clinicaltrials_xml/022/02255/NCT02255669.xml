	<brief_title>Fully Covered SEMS Versus Partially Covered SEMS With Anti-migration System Malignant Distal Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic stent placement use principle palliative method patient unresectable distal malignancy biliary obstruction . It pivotal provide relief obstructive jaundice , improve quality life , allow maintenance chemotherapy . Although SEMSs report superior plastic stent term stent patency , still debatable issue ; uncover SEMS , stent occlusion due epithelial hyperplasia tumor ingrowth metal mesh frequent problem , whereas cover SEMSs prone migration . The aim current study compare duration stent patency partially cover fully cover SEMS primary objective , investigate overall patient survival , stent occlusion rate , incidence adverse event include stent dysfunction secondary objective .</detailed_description>
