	<brief_summary>Background Statins cholesterol lower drug prescribe low risk cardio-vascular disease . The use statin increase markedly one prescribed drug world . 600,000 people Denmark take statin daily basis , 40 % take medication without risk factor cardio-vascular disease elevate blood-cholesterol i.e . primary prevention . Statins without side effect study show elevated risk develop diabetes take statin . This lead increased debate use statins primary prevention . Furthermore large meta-analysis show prevent one event cardio-vascular disease , necessary treat 200 people 3-5 year . These data suggest conservative use statins prevent CVD otherwise healthy individual low risk future CVD may warrant . Other side effect statins muscle myalgia , muscle cramp fatigue potentially prevent physically active lifestyle . The biomedical background side effect fully elucidate show link decreasing level important enzyme , Q10 , play role muscle energy metabolism . Hypothesis The overarch research question : statin treatment cause muscle pain ? Does statin treatment impair ( even prevent ) physical exercise training ? Furthermore would like answer follow question : 1 . Does statin treatment impair ( even prohibit ) physical exercise training ? 2 . Does statin treatment cause : - Decreased muscle strength ? - Skeletal muscle inflammation ? - Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function ? 3 . Abnormal glucose homeostasis ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA AND STATIN USE IN DENMARK Simvastatin commonly prescribe statin , class drug inhibit hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl ( HMG ) coenzyme A reductase , thereby block biosynthesis cholesterol liver . Simvastatin prescribed individual elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and/or total cholesterol , clinical parameter view risk factor cardiovascular-disease ( CVD ) , even absence health problem risk factor , previous myocardial infarction , diabetes hypertension . Approximately 40 % prescription statins issued primary prevention elevate cholesterol general practitioner patient without bodily symptom sign . Only `` cholesterol number '' make risk heart attack stroke visible . The lack symptom likely importance patient ' adherence treatment adverse effect . A number factor , information mass medium change daily life , may affect decision take treatment TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA The guideline ( 8 ; 10 ) indicate preventive treatment statin appropriate individual &gt; 10 % predict risk major vascular event within 5 year , , , opinion-leaders advocate 5 % threshold ( 2 ; 8 ) . Nevertheless , statin therapy fail reduce all-cause mortality meta-study 65,229 patient without CVD , diabetes ( 11 ) . Similarly , Cochrane review analysis , include study 10 % patient history CVD , show 0.5 % reduction all-cause mortality , indicate every 200 patient take statin daily 5 year , 1 death would prevent ( 13 ) . These data suggest conservative use statins prevent CVD otherwise healthy individual low risk future CVD may warrant . THE DOWN-SIDE Rhabdomyolysis ( skeletal muscle cell death ) infrequent serious side-effect statin use , rare occasion lead acute renal failure death ( i.e. , 1.5 death per 106 prescription ( 9 ) ) . Statin use much frequently associate muscle dysfunction , include myalgia ( muscle pain ) , cramp , weakness . The reported incidence myalgia vary 1 % ( pharmaceutical company report ) high 75 % statin-treated athlete ( 7 ; 9 ) . Mild severe myalgia strong disincentive regular exercise , regular exercise one critical life-style approach prevent CVD reduce blood cholesterol , significant down-side statin use . Regular exercise also effective prevent treat obesity type 2 diabetes , risk factor CVD ( 16 ) . The mechanism behind myalgia know . However , recently demonstrate muscle mitochondrial function impair statin treatment Q10 protein may play key role ( 6 ) . In addition , statin also negatively affect glucose tolerance ( 6 ) , increase risk type 2 diabetes . RESEARCH QUESTIONS : The overarch research question : statin treatment cause muscle pain ? We research group world try answer question , one indeed provide mechanistic explanation , provide proof-of-concept ( 6 ) . We test large patient population . Our background muscle exercise physiology bioenergetics make natural ask : 1 . Does statin treatment impair ( even prohibit ) physical exercise training ? 2 . Does statin treatment cause : - Decreased muscle strength ? - Skeletal muscle inflammation ? - Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function ? 3 . Abnormal glucose homeostasis ? Re question B &amp; C : If , physical training counteract effect statin treatment ? Methodology COHORT Patients fulfil define inclusion exclusion criterion recruit General Practice clinic Copenhagen news paper advertisement . The vast majority patient treat basis HeartScore risk estimation system offer direct estimation ten-year risk fatal cardiovascular disease format suit constraint clinical practice ( 14 ) ( www.HeartScore.org ) . 60 patient men woman ( age : 40-70 year ; BMI : 25-35 kg/m2 ) take Simvastatin primary prevention recruit . No risk factor CVD except elevate total cholesterol and/or elevate LDL cholesterol mild hypertension ( &lt; 145/100 mm Hg ) must present . The patient allocate ( randomization draw lot ) one two group : - Simvastatin 40 mg/day Q10-supplementation 400 mg/day - Simvastatin 40 mg/day Q10-placebo The intervention period 8 week series experimental day . Experimental day ( identical intervention ) : Day 1 ( ½ day - overnight fasting ) : - Medical history ; clinical examination + ECG . Measurements : Blood pressure , weight , height , W/H-ratio , thigh circumference . - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry-scan ( DXA ) ( body composition body fat ) . - FatMax test maximal oxygen uptake test ( VO2-max ) ergometer bike . Day 2 ( ½ day - overnight fasting ) : - Oral glucose tolerance test + score questionnaire muscle pain/discomfort ( Visual Analog Scale ) questionnaire regard extent muscle pain/discomfort . - Isokinetic strength Rate Force Development ( PowerRig KinCom dynamometer ) . - Repeated VO2-max-test Day 3 ( 1 day - overnight fasting ) : - Muscle biopsy , vastus lateralis ( clamp ) , fat biopsy subcutaneus adipose tissue abdomen . - Intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) - Euglycemic , hyperinsulinaemic clamp . Statistical consideration The major end-points end-point test clinical population . In general , order detect 10 % difference parameter vs. train program statin user control , require 15-20 subject group alpha level &lt; 0.05 risk type 2 error set 10 % . 10-15 subject necessary `` conventional '' 20 % type 2 error risk implement . Thus , present study considerable safety-margin term statistical power .</detailed_description>
