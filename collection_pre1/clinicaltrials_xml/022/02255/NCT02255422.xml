	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial myopathy multisystemic group disorder characterize wide range biochemical genetic mitochondrial defect variable mode inheritance . Currently effective treatment disease . Despite heterogeneous myopathy phenotype , unifying feature mitochondrial myopathy pathogenic mtDNA mutation and/or nuclear mutation electron transport chain invariably lead dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration . This reduction mitochondrial respiration lead reduce ability produce cellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , often result muscle weakness , exercise intolerance , fatigue patient mitochondrial myopathy . RTA 408 potent activator Nrf2 inhibitor NF κB ( nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activate B cell ) , thus induces antioxidant anti-inflammatory phenotype . Several line evidence suggest Nrf2 activation increase mitochondrial respiration biogenesis . Collectively , available data suggest ability RTA 408 activate Nrf2 induce target gene could potentially improve muscle function , oxidative phosphorylation , antioxidant capacity , mitochondrial biogenesis patient mitochondrial myopathy . Part 1 : The first part study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , dose-escalation study evaluate safety omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) various dos patient mitochondrial myopathy . Part 2 : The second part study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel study evaluate safety , efficacy , pharmacodynamics 2 dose level omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) patient mitochondrial myopathy . Eligible patient Part 2 randomized 1:1:1 receive omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) ( one 2 dos choose Part 1 ) , placebo .</brief_summary>
