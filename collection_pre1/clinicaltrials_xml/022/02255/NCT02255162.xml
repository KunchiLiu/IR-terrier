	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate safety tolerability drug lenalidomide combination follow mismatch related donor microtransplantation high risk AML patient first remission . This study also aim define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide give set . Microtransplantation seek give participant donor cell hop cell attack underlying cancer . However , since donor cell replace host cell , hopefully avoid many serious risk involve standard transplant , include graft-vs.-host disease ( GVHD ) - complication donor cell attack participant 's normal body . Recent study suggest lenalidomide help aid donor cell attack cancer give stem cell transplant . This trial try see lenalidomide help encourage attack leukemia cell donor cell give part microtransplantation . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve lenalidomide approved us treatment cancer include multiple myeloma non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Although lenalidomide study patient AML , approve FDA standard use AML . Lenalidomide compound make Celgene Corporation . It property could demonstrate antitumor effect . The exact antitumor mechanism action lenalidomide unknown .</brief_summary>

Adequate renal function define : calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min ( CockcroftGault Formula ) serum Cr less institution ULN ( elderly often &lt; 60 GFR ) ECOG performance status 02 . Have diagnosis highrisk AML establish poorrisk karyotype , adverse risk ELN criterion , therapyrelated AML , age ≥ 60 antecedent hematologic disorder LVEF must equal great 40 % , measure MUGA scan echocardiogram Patients , appropriate designee , must able provide inform consent . Must receive systemic antineoplastic therapy , include radiotherapy within 14 day study treatment . Female patient childbearing age must negative pregnancy test . Male subject agrees use acceptable method contraception entire study treatment period 6 month last dose lenalidomide . All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® program . Females reproductive potential must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require Revlimid REMS® program . If need , patient able take aspirin ( 81 325 mg ) daily prophylactic anticoagulation . Donor Inclusion Criteria Haploidentical 1stdegree relative define 3/6 4/6 HLAmatched HLA A , B , DRB1 1870 year age ECOG performance status 0 1 Excellent health per conventional predonor history ( medical psychosocial evaluation ) No positive test viral infection ( HbsAg , HIV , HCV ) Donor ability understand provide inform consent Meets standard institutional criterion GCSF mobilize PBSC donation Recipient Exclusion Criteria Diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia Active refractory relapse acute leukemia Prior use fludarabine , agent associate high subsequent rate graft versus host disease Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction study drug . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . A diagnosis active hepatitis B C define detectable viral load assay blood Known hypersensitivity thalidomide lenalidomide . The development erythema nodosum characterize desquamate rash take lenalidomide . Significant cardiac disease determine investigator include : Known suspected cardiac amyloidosis Congestive heart failure Class III IV NYHA classification Uncontrolled angina , hypertension arrhythmia Myocardial infarction past 6 month Any uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease Prior cerebrovascular event persistent neurologic deficit Medical condition , investigator 's opinion , would impose excessive risk subject . Equal great grade 2 ataxia , cranial peripheral neuropathy . Systemic infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 7 day precede first dose study drug , severe infection . Pregnant woman exclude study .</criteria>
