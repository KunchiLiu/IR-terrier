	<detailed_description>The cardiac output ( CO ) volume blood eject heart time beat . It product stroke volume ( SV ) heart rate ( HR ) express litre per minute . It give measure performance heart pump . The normal rest CO 70kg person approximately 5 6 litres/min , due rest HR 70-80 bpm multiply average SV 70-80ml . Different organ body receive differ proportion CO accord demand . CO increase significantly pregnancy due grow uterus , fetus placenta , actual value affect patient position medical intervention , epidural analgesia . Cardiovascular change pregnancy During pregnancy , cardiovascular system change adapt demand uteroplacental unit . CO start increase first trimester 35-40 % , 50 % rise end second trimester . It remain level third trimester 1 . The increase CO occur due increase HR 25 % SV 30 % . There rise CO labour delivery , transient . CO also depend upon patient position , 13.5 % increase leave lateral position supine . The increase CO leave lateral position basis leave lateral tilt wedge apply pregnant patient supine . This reduce compression large abdominal blood vessel ( aortocaval compression ) gravid ( pregnant ) uterus allow CO maintain . The proportion CO distribute uterus , kidney skin great pregnancy compare non-pregnant state . Uterine blood flow approximately 500 700 ml/min , correspond 10-12 % CO 1 . More 80 % CO perfuse placenta . Lumbar epidurals labour Lumbar epidural use commonly analgesia labour , well anaesthesia operative intervention , low segment Caesarean section ( LSCS ) instrumental delivery . It well know epidural anaesthesia cause haemodynamic change , namely peripheral vasodilatation reduction systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) due blockade sympathetic nervous system control many autonomic function include blood pressure heart rate 1 . This lead reduction blood pressure CO maintain , since three related formula ; mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) = CO x SVR . If CO drop , example due hypovolaemia ( decreased amount fluid circulation ) postural change , great decrease blood pressure . Valsalva manoeuvre Originally describe 17th century , Valsalva manoeuvre perform attempted exhalation resistance , usually close airway . It use routinely equalize ambient pressure inner ear sinus ie air travel scuba dive . Medically used test cardiac function autonomic nervous system control hearts response stimulus . The standardised Valsalva manoeuvre require subject place semirecumbent position produce expiratory pressure 40mmHg 10 seconds2 . Methods measure cardiac output There several method measure cardiac output , use pregnancy may limit risk mother effect technique develop fetus . Invasive method - The `` gold standard '' CO monitor pulmonary artery catheter . This measure CO use temperature change injectate ( thermodilution principle ) blood pass cardiac chamber . It accurate allow measurement pulmonary artery pressure , obvious drawback invasive nature device , couple risk injury heart pulmonary vessel . Due invasive nature , use almost exclusively patient severely unwell , necessitating central catheterisation . Even , currently evidence randomise control trial support use pulmonary artery catheter 2 . Its use possible normal pregnancy , would unacceptable subject patient risks central catheterisation . Other invasive technique angiography conductance catheter cause radiation exposure develop fetus . Semi-invasive method include LiDCO PiCCO . The LiDCO monitor use transpulmonary lithium dilution via central line catheter arterial sampling line calibration . It use arterial waveform analysis provide continuous CO measurement . PiCCO use transpulmonary thermodilution , via central line arterial sampling line . The disadvantage lithium dilution avoid first trim normal pregnancy require central arterial line . This negate use normal pregnant population . However , new LiDCO product LiDCOrapid use literature 3 . Non-invasive method cardiac output measurement cornerstone study maternal cardiac physiology normal pathological pregnancy last 20 year , since introduction Doppler echocardiography , around 1985 4 . Echocardiographic technique aim estimate SV , multiply HR obtain CO value . This do use 2D , 3D Doppler echocardiography 5 . The obvious advantage vascular access calibration need , experience operator require , make routine use difficult . Novel non-invasive cardiac output monitor since appeared market , noninvasive cardiac output monitor ( NICOM ) , ultrasonic cardiac output monitor ( USCOM ) estimate continuous cardiac output ( esCCO ) monitor . The esCCO monitor The esCCO monitor manufacture Nihon Kohden6 use 3 lead electrocardiogram pulse oximeter ( oxygen saturation probe ) estimate CO . This method measure CO show correlate well trend CO measure use pulmonary artery catheterisation method7 , 8 . It also show correlate well echo Doppler exercise9 . Bataille et al ( 2012 ) compare esCCO monitor transthoracic echocardiography CO measurement intensive care patients10 . The author deem esCCO clinically unacceptable critically ill patient , although question validity study11 , 12 . This primarily extensive vasoconstriction peripheral shut critically ill septic patient . Use device obstetrics acceptable . The esCCO monitor use non-invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) , three-lead ECG pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) . These modality part routine clinical monitoring , make monitor ideal measure CO normal pregnant population . Patients admit labour ward often require monitor least NIBP SpO2 , hence three-lead ECG 'extra ' . By validate monitor , CO measurement across variety clinical scenario pregnant population possible .</detailed_description>
