	<detailed_description>1 . PCOS Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrinopathy among woman reproductive age , associate reproductive metabolic dysfunction prevalence 5-10 % reproductive age woman . Diagnostic criterion vary accord Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM- Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group PCOS define least two follow three criterion present : [ ] polycystic ovary , ultrasound [ ii ] oligo and/or anovulation , [ iii ] clinical and/or biochemical sign hyperandrogenism . The clinical presentation varies amenorrhea sonographic picture polycystic ovary subtle phenotypic abnormality sign hyperandrogenism , advance Stein Leventhal syndrome clinical heterogeneity rule . Moreover , woman PCOS might exhibit feature metabolic syndrome , include impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , obesity dyslipidaemia , associate long- term sequela , namely endometrial carcinoma , hypertension , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) cardiovascular disease . Impaired Glucose Intolerance ( IGT ) PCOS Impaired glucose tolerance , insulin resistance , define decrease insulin-mediated glucose utilization . It long recognize major risk factor diabetes . Moreover , show lifestyle intervention metformin patient IGT , may reduce prevalence T2D . Several dynamic invasive test calculate index currently available detect IGT . While euglycemic clamp technique consider accurate test assessment insulin resistance , cumbersome test frequently replace simple measurement ratio fast glucose fasting insulin , 2-hour glucose level 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ( WHO criteria , impair glucose tolerance [ IGT ] &gt; 140 mg/dL 199 mg/dL ) . As result , report prevalence IGT woman PCOS vary depend sensitivity specificity test employ heterogenic phenotype PCOS . Obesity - definition , significance prevalence among woman PCOS : Obesity , common clinical manifestation PCOS patient , link insulin resistance failure delay response various COH treatments.The associate health detriment major health problem increase increase body mass index ( BMI ) . Data regard impact obesity IVF cycle outcome controversial , range study report effect increase BMI IVF success rate demonstrate lower cumulative live birth rate overweight patient . PCOS assist reproduction PCOS woman insulin resistance undergoing ovulation induction gonadotropin long duration treatment , use high total FSH dose , elevate cancellation rate low conception rate . Improving insulin sensitivity lifestyle pharmacological intervention suggest ameliorate aforementioned abnormality , restore ovulation enhance pregnancy woman PCOS . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) embryo transfer ( ET ) effective therapy PCOS patient result pregnancy rate comparable woman tubal factor infertility . Moreover , number multiple pregnancy keep minimum transfer small number embryos , IVF-ET become reasonable option PCOS patient refractory conventional infertility modality coexist infertility factor . Many control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) strategies offer treatment patient PCOS undergo IVF . In attempt examine influence BMI IVF outcome patient undergo COH either GnRH-agonist antagonist , investigator find patient BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 , COH either GnRH-agonist antagonist achieve comparable outcome , BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 , use GnRH-agonist suppressive protocol reveal significantly high pregnancy rate . Moreover , another study PCOS patient undergo IVF-ET cycle , investigator demonstrate COH utilize midluteal long GnRH-agonist suppressive protocol protocol choice lean patient , probably due ability lower high basal LH milieu detrimental effect oocyte ' quality implantation potential . 2 . Device Description ENDOBARRIER The EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner system receive CE Mark 11 December 2009 indicate treatment obesity Type 2 diabetes . The implant indicated maximum implant duration period twelve month . The intent EndoBarrier facilitate glycemic control weight loss mimic portion Roux-en-Y bypass procedure . The device consist 3 component : implant , delivery system , removal system . The procedure entail bypass duodenum proximal jejunum 60 cm non-permeable polymeric sleeve attach duodenal wall . This sleeve prevents contact food duodenal wall , thereby re-capitulating one major property RYGB operation . With technique , control diabetes accompanied weight loss , need medication may cause weight gain / hypoglycemia may serve replace postpone surgery . In recent paper de Moura et al , Twenty-two subject uncontrolled type 2 diabetes body mass index 40- 60 kg/m ² implant EndoBarrier follow prospectively 1 year . The author find statistically significant reduction fast blood glucose ( - 30.3 ± 10.2 mg/dL ) , fast insulin ( - 7.3 ± 2.6 lU/mL ) , HbA1c ( - 2.1±0.3 % ) patient undergoing procedure . The study conclusion EndoBarrier improve glycemic status obese subject diabetes therefore represent non-surgical , reversible alternative bariatric surgery . Internal data GI Dynamics reveal obese subject ( average BMI 44 kg/m² ) uncontrolled diabetes ( average A1c 8.4 % ) implant EndoBarrier one year show following : 1 . A reduction 2.1 % A1c level , value le 7 % 80 % subject . 2 . An average reduction 20 Kg ( represent 16 % excess weight ) . 3 . A 29 % reduction triglyceride level 14 % reduction LDL-c. After 12 month EndoBarrier remove subject remain follow additional 18 month . During period , achievement maintain . 3 . Study Design : This two arm open-label three phase trail investigate effect EndoBarrier device fertility metabolic parameter obese insulin resistant ( IR ) PCOS woman Arm 1 : woman seek pregnancy fail IVF treatment cycle/s . Arm 2 : woman seek pregnancy failure ovulate response clomiphene citrate ( CC ) - clomiphene resistant . Phase 1 : ( treatment phase ) - Six month Endobarrier Phase 2 : ( follow-up phase ) - Twelve month Endobarrier retrieval Phase 3 : ( long term observation phase ) - see whether pregnancy achieve within second year retrieval . 4 .
