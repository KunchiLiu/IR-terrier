	<brief_title>Bifocal Lenses In Nearsighted Kids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal project determine whether commercially available soft bifocal contact lens distance-center design slow myopia progression child . Using soft bifocal contact lenses manipulate peripheral optic eye novel use standard contact lens may keep child become nearsighted would otherwise . Secondary goal determine whether amount myopic defocus impose peripheral retina soft bifocal contact lens associate dose-dependent manner slow myopic progression determine whether peripheral myopic blur act slow eye growth locally globally . These important piece information enable investigator learn role peripheral optic regulate eye growth , could ultimately lead optimization optical signal slow myopia progression . Ultimately , information could use design optical device prevent onset myopia young child . Slowing myopia progression eventually prevent myopia onset could potentially affect approximately 60 million child United States alone . While consequence myopia rarely sight-threatening , quality life myopic patient negatively affect health care cost treat myopia astronomical ( approximately $ 4.6 billion 1990 ) . The National Eye Institute recognize need `` evaluate efficacy potential treatment delay onset slow progression myopia , lenses alter peripheral defocus . '' Using common treatment myopia ( contact lens ) potentially slow myopia progression learn optical signal regulate eye growth novel approach solve problem affect large proportion people United States .</detailed_description>
