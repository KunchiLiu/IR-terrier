	<brief_summary>This four-site , randomize , parallel design , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 10-week trial donepezil 10 mg daily verbal memory problem among adult TBI subacute chronic recovery period . The study recruit 160 person TBI functionally important memory problem four-year period open recruitment . The study aim : 1 . To evaluate effect treatment donepezil verbal memory assess Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Total Trial 1-3 ; 2 . To evaluate effect treatment donepezil memory-related activity measure Everyday Memory Questionnaire ; 3 . To evaluate effect donepezil attention , process speed , neuropsychiatric symptom , community participation , quality life , caregiver experience .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Memory deficit among common chronic functionally important consequence traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Basic clinical research study suggest persistent deficit verbal memory associate chronically reduce level acetylcholine brain . Medicines increase level acetylcholine brain appear improve memory cognitive problem experience person TBI . However , study perform thus far provide level evidence need establish best practice . This study definitively establish whether , extent , donepezil effective treatment functionally important TBI-related memory deficit . The study begin Screening visit . After consent participate research obtain participant legally-authorized representative , screen assessment perform . Over two week follow visit , study eligibility determine . Participants meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion randomly assign ( 1:1 ) 1 2 drug group : donepezil placebo . Participants evaluate Baseline ( pre-treatment ) Visit use assessment physical health , cognition , neuropsychiatric status , everyday functioning , community participation , quality life , caregiver appraisal . At conclusion visit , participant begin ten week treatment period either donepezil 5 mg daily match placebo . Telephone contact occur end study week 1 2 . Calls assess support participant ' adherence study protocol , obtain information treatment-related side effect , address safety tolerability concern . At week 2 telephone contact , participant tolerate start dose study medication advance donepezil 10 mg daily match placebo . Telephone contact occur every 2 week Interim Assessment Visit study week 6 , time assessment physical health , cognition , neuropsychiatric status , everyday functioning , community participation , quality life , caregiver appraisal perform . This visit follow telephone contact study week 8 Outcome Assessment Visit study week 10 . At visit participant caregiver complete assessment physical health , cognition , neuropsychiatric status , everyday functioning , community participation , quality life , caregiver appraisal . After completion week 10 assessment , extent participant caregiver remain blinded study condition ( allocation concealment ) evaluate inquire whether believe receive donepezil placebo . Study staff also offer write opinion study condition participant assign . The Discontinuation period ( termination study medication ) begin upon conclusion final visit . Study team site remain available receive question and/or concern participant and/or caregiver 4-week Discontinuation period . Two analysis study population consider study , modify intent-to-treat ( mITT ) population clinically evaluable population . The mITT sample include individual deem eligible study participation base Screening Assessment ; randomize study treatment ; assess use HVLT-R Baseline Visit ; receive least one dose study treatment . The analysis mITT sample consider primary analysis . The clinically evaluable population secondary analysis call per-protocol population . Inclusion per-protocol population require least eight week double-blind study treatment , data primary outcome Outcome Assessment , least 80 % treatment adherence determine pill count return blister pack , major protocol violation . For primary outcome HVLT-R Total Trails 1-3 , primary analysis examine donepezil effect measure week 10 use general linear model ( GLM ) . Because secondary outcome approximately continuous-type , test use similar GLM procedure state estimate test effect donepezil . Additionally , general linear mixed model perform compare data drug placebo group , account center effect covariables . Side effect data form frequency event ( drug related/by severity/serious ) evaluate use Mantel-Haenszel test . Exact binomial confidence interval side effect event frequency also generate . Findings study influence practice prescribe healthcare provider contribute information improve live person TBI family . In addition dissemination final study result , MEMRI-TBI-D Study team disseminate information evidence-based treatment memory impairment consumer professional audience throughout funding period . Through knowledge translation activity , consumer health care provider provide information regard effectiveness intervention persistent posttraumatic memory impairment .</detailed_description>
