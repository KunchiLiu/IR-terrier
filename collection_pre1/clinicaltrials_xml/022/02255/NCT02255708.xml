	<brief_summary>The present study aim assess surface electromyography , effectiveness proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation protocol activation stabilize muscle scapula anterior tibial muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Intervention Program Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation , Muscle Force Irradiation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subject subject demyelinate polyneuropathy involve study . Healthy patient arrange two group stimulation : FNP Group ( intervention proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation ) - CC Group ( intervention classic cinesioterapia ) . The electromyographic response stabilize muscle scapula individual assess prior application protocol , execution protocol immediately stop single session . Patients demyelinate polyneuropathy arrange single treatment group treat frequency twice week five week . In session , PNF pattern repeat four time , side , stimulate muscle irradiation evoke contraction tibialis anterior muscle . During repetition pattern , dorsiflexor muscle response patient obtain electromyography ( EMG ) surface . The data RMS value obtain first session normalize transformed percentage . The average RMS diagonal beginning treatment correspond 100 % TA muscle activation . The RMS value obtain last session normalize percentage , take account result first evaluation . After normalization , data first last session besubjected paired t-test .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy individual group : agree participate study history previous trauma disease shoulder girdle , absence clinical sign painful shoulder joint . Group demyelinate polyneuropathy : sex , carrier CMT1A disease functional change low limb good cognition difficulty ambulate without assistance . Healthy individual group : subject restrict range motion , muscle weakness , cognitive impairment , exhibit pathology lead alteration muscle recruitment . Patients polyneuropathy : cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , severe cardiovascular disease respiratory problem . The use medicine treat pathology accept .</criteria>
