	<detailed_description>Introduction : Ischemic heart diseases lead cause death Mexico mainly due acute myocardial infarction . In sense , reperfusion strategy cornerstone treatment reduce complication cost ; however , less 50 percent patient receive treatment third world 's population die cause . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) predict next two decade 23.5 million death worldwide cardiovascular disease . Particularly Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) cause 2008 seven million death worldwide . It estimate year Mexico around 300 thousand people suffer ACS , least 60 percent cause Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) real number morbidity real clinical complication . Efforts make Mexican registry ACS show first real world study do IMSS serve great number case ( 54.4 percent ) call `` National Registry Acute Coronary Syndromes '' ( RENASCA IMSS ) . In registry 10 tertiary care hospital participate enrol 2,398 patient ACS diagnosis , ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) , represent 63 percent ; average age 62 year . In 65 percent case stratify high risk ( GRACE &gt; 150 point ) , 42 percent treat fibrinolytic therapy , 8 percent primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) remain 50 percent receive reperfusion therapy cornerstone prognosis patient . Currently Mexico experience increase elderly population frequency traditional risk factor atherosclerosis associate factor overweight obesity become high-risk population group ischemic heart diseases complication . It represent challenge health system point view prevention begin also diagnosis , prognosis , treatment . Treatment goal traditional risk factor accomplish yet . Patients diagnose late risk model population since 50 percent patient receive adequate treatment . Therefore necessary current outlook happen mexican population National Registry patient ACS IMSS ( RENASCA IMSS ) . This allow know real world term risk factor frequency , clinical presentation complication , end risk model build . OBJECTIVE : To develop risk model early Major Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) patient Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) base IMSS National Registry Acute Coronary Syndromes ( RENASCA IMSS . ) MATERIAL AND METHODS : Consecutive patient gender 18 90 year old , diagnose Acute Coronary Syndrome ( STEMI/ NSTEMI/ Unstable angina - accord international diagnostic criterion - American College Cardiology ( ACC ) / American Heart Association ( AHA ) / European society Cardiology ( ESC ) , attend representative hospital tertiary care IMSS study . The design analytical consecutive prospective multicenter study emerge cohort patient ACS National Registry unit tertiary care IMSS ( RENASCA IMSS ) . Follow-up do hospitalization 30 day , time Major Cardiovascular Events presentation ( MACE ) derive time initial treatment lack . MACE evaluate Follow-up : Reinfarction , myocardial ischemia , heart failure , electrocardiographic complication / death ( mortality ) . 8 tertiary care hospital Medical Units High Specialty ( UMAES acronym Spanish ) participate represent country : analysis clinical paraclinical variable contain record consider relevant predict inception cohort MACE hospitalization 30 day do . The cohort major cardiovascular event ( previously define ) compare cohort comprise patient without event . Statistical analysis do central tendency dispersion measure accord distribution variable . We use hypothesis test accord normality data T-test independent group Mann-Whitney test continuous variable , whereas categorical variable X2 test Fisher exact test observe frequency &lt; 5 use . The free event analyze Kaplan Meier curve . To determine correlation performer ( blind independent ) angiography echocardiography use Kappa index . The development risk model perform logistic regression dependent variable presence MACE hospitalization 30 day ( Wald method , backward ) . Variables clinical epidemiological history consider relevant include , accord also biological epidemiological consistency plausibility . The statistical criterion inclusion variable bivariate analysis show p &lt; 0.20 exit criterion model pâ‰¥0.05 . The discriminative power model do area Receiver Operating Characteristic curve ( ROC curve ) . The calibration do Hosmer-Lemeshow test . Relative risk confidence interval 95 percent calculate . All hypothesis test do alpha level &lt; 0.05 . TIME OF DEVELOPMENT : Two year .</detailed_description>
