	<brief_title>Confirmatory Study Eteplirsen DMD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , 96-week study evaluate efficacy safety eteplirsen patient genotypically confirm Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) genetic deletion amenable exon 51 skipping ( treat group ) , concurrent control arm DMD patient amenable exon 51 skipping ( untreated group ) . Following primary efficacy endpoint week 48 , dose continue week 96 evaluate long term effect eteplirsen . Patients treat group receive weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusions 30 mg/kg Eteplirsen . Patients untreated group receive treatment . Clinical efficacy assess regularly schedule study visit , include functional test six minute walk test . Patients treat group undergo muscle biopsy Baseline second muscle biopsy course study . Patients untreated group undergo muscle biopsy . Safety , include adverse event monitoring routine laboratory assessment , continuously monitor patient . The sponsor work initiate approximately 39 site across United States . Sites vary follow function : 1 . Local Site ( N=39 ) - Enrolls patient primary contact point patient . Sites perform protocol activity ( include dose laboratory assessment ) , except functional assessment biopsy . 2 . Hub Site ( N=14 ) - Performs functional ( physical ) assessment specify time per protocol . 3 . Surgical Site ( N=2 ) - Performs muscle biopsy Treated group .</detailed_description>
