	<brief_summary>Motor cortex stimulation ( MCS ) form brain stimulation patient neuropathic pain responsive medication . An electrode place surface brain connect programmable battery chest . The strength stimulation individually adjust change voltage stimulation . A high voltage produce side effect ( e.g . seizure ) low voltage provide pain control . The aim study analyze optimal stimulation parameter patient already implant motor cortex stimulation receive good pain relief . The actual voltage may vary widely patient investigator feel may `` ideal '' voltage measure percentage motor threshold ( PMT ) . If motor threshold stimulation voltage evoke muscle contraction PMT = 80 % would voltage eighty percent value . Although actual voltage may widely different patient , percentage need may similar . The investigator therefore plan measure effect different percentage PMT patient already treat motor cortex stimulation . Systematic analysis finding study might help individual participant future patient well program less side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Motor cortex stimulation ( MCS ) form brain stimulation patient medically refractory neuropathic pain . The strength stimulation individually adjust change voltage stimulation . Too high voltage produce side effect ( e.g . seizure ) low voltage provide pain control . The aim study analyze optimal stimulation parameter patient already implant motor cortex stimulation receive good pain relief . The actual voltage may vary widely patient ( individual variation tissue resistance ) investigator feel may `` ideal '' voltage measure percentage motor threshold ( PMT ) . If motor threshold voltage evoke muscle contraction PMT = 80 % would voltage eighty percent value . Although actual voltage may different patient , effective PMT may similar since represent physiologic measure stimulation . Systematic analysis finding study might help individual participant future patient reduce voltage low effective setting reduce chance seizure . Motor cortex stimulation use treatment neuropathic pain since 1991 still guideline program exist program therefore mainly base trial error . This mostly due many variable influence choice stimulation parameter significant individual difference susceptibility stimulation . Routinely motor threshold determine program identify superior limit voltage twitch induce . No stimulation motor threshold perform know cause seizure . The voltage simulation effective individual unknown beginning treatment . The investigator try find low effective voltage reduce risk stimulation-induced seizure prolong life pacemaker .</detailed_description>
