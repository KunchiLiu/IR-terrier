	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /phase II recommend dose describe toxicity relate PD-0332991 ( palbociclib isethionate ) child retinoblastoma protein 1 ( Rb1 ) positive recurrent , progressive refractory primary central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . II . To determine plasma pharmacokinetics PD-0332991 child Rb1positive recurrent , progressive refractory primary CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To record preliminary evidence efficacy PD-0332991 child recurrent CNS tumor . II . To evaluate cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4/6 , cyclin D1-3 , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( Ink4a-ARF ) copy-number variation available tumor tissue array comparative , genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) . III . To explore potential relationship pharmacokinetics PD-0332991 pharmacodynamic response ( e.g . percentage change absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] , platelet count ) . IV . To explore pharmacogenetic polymorphism PD-0332991 metabolize enzyme transporter relate polymorphisms PD-0332991 pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive palbociclib isethionate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
