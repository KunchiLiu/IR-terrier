	<brief_summary>The aim study find optimal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method examine patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Patients furthermore avoid exposed unnecessary X-rays invasive examination . It investigators expectation study benefit future patient , offer MRI first choice . Hereby , patient avoid risk discomfort associate x-ray examination . The aim patient IBD achieve good earlier treatment achieve benefit patient public health . An early treatment lead few hospitalization thereby save community money . The investigator hope investigator study show MRI one best tool examine patient IBD future lead MRI first choice contrary examination x-ray exposer , unless contraindication MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IBD common term two chronic disease , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . IBD occur often age 20-30 year . There 25,000 people Denmark IBD diseases incidence prevalence increase past 20 year [ 1 ] . In Denmark , incidence CD increase fourfold 10 per 100,000 inhabitant per year incidence UC double 17 per 100,000 inhabitant per year [ 2 ] . Its cause completely know indicate interaction genetic external factor . IBD mention chronic disease mean flare periodically throughout life . Studies show 50 % give time clinical remission , 25 % moderate disease activity 25 % significant disease activity [ 3 ] . This mean patient IBD likely undergo repeatedly examination confirm invalidate disease activity . It essential patient disease keep control maintain normal working life well-functioning social life . Most study investigator study begin form conventional small-bowel follow-through compute tomographic ( CT ) . A place Denmark begin experiment MRI diagnostics method still standardize protocol . There many advantage use MRI : Patients avoid expose X-ray radiation thus examination carry repeatedly without problem . It especially important fertile woman . There evidence harmful effect MRI oppose CT scanning , repeat exposure X-ray radiation increase risk cancer [ 4 ] . You could potentially avoid invasive procedure , thus reduce study duration . General request follow highlight project : Compare three different MRI scan Compare clinic MRI : Calprotectin compare MRI finding . The investigator examine follow hypothesis : MR enterography diagnose pathology well well MRI enteroclysis . Plain MRI diagnose pathology well well MRI enteroclysis . Plain MRI diagnose pathology well well MRI enterography . Method : This study carry prospective cross-sectional study ( study I-V pilot study ) collaboration radiology department gastroenterology department Herlev Hospital . The study recruit inpatient outpatient know suspected IBD . The main study include least 77 patient , pilot study include minimum 15 patient . Two experienced radiologist diagnosis diseases gastrointestinal describe MRI scan . Interpretation MRI perform accord standard table . Studies I-III compare evaluate effectiveness study . Patients receive faeces sample kit first day meet MRI . The sample take two day MRI scan send mail . The sample contain 5-10 g faeces analyze ELISA method calprotectin . Calprotectin good marker degree inflammation intestine . [ 5 ] Analysis sample immediately reception costly . The sample therefore frozen gastroenterology department Herlev Hospital . When investigator collect 20 sample expect within one month sample analyze calprotectin . The material destroyed immediately analysis use future research project . The study approve Local Committee Health Research Ethics Danish Data Protection Agency . Study I : Plain MR : Patients undergo MRI abdomen without oral IV contrast agent [ 6 ] . There several new study show diffusion-weighted MRI good showing pathology [ 7-9 ] . Intravenous buscopan give study reduce peristalsis intestine scan . Study II : MR enterography : This study do immediately study I . Patients study I must take approximately 1.5 l VoLume orally 1 hour . Previous study show water alone , take orally absorbed quickly intestine thus result desired dilation [ 10-11 ] . VoLume aqueous solution barium sulfate reabsorb intestine . The contrast immediate side effect , may case cause constipation . It crucial interpretation MRI achieve optimal dilatation intestine . In end scan patient get iv gadolinium . MR enterography gold standard study . Study III : MR Enteroclysis ( MRE ) : The patient undergo MRE approx . 7 day later . A nasojejunal tube place fluoroscopy . The radiation patient expose minimal without risk [ 11-12 ] . For study II III comparable , important amount fluid consume study . Study IV : This part study consist questionnaire-based study patient ' experience study II-III [ 13 ] . Study V : In study calprotectin compare study II . Study VI : Conducted pilot study . A small group patient undergo MRI scan IV contrast , substudy II , albeit without prior intake 1.5 l barium solution . These patient also MRI enterografi ( substudy II ) 3-7 day later . The result two scan compare . The study include operational interventional procedure patient involve study , use placebo . Subjects Minimum 77 subject study I-V minimum 15 subject pilot study include . All patient eighter know IBD diagnose suspect IBD . There consider healthy subject . Participants must 18 year old .</detailed_description>
