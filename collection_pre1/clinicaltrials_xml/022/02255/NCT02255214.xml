	<brief_summary>Central Neuraxial Blockade ( CNB ) commonly use anaesthetic . It several advantage general anaesthetic however contraindication include coagulopathy . Guidelines suggest CNB undertaken International Normalised Ratio ( INR ) 1.5 great . A common cause elevate INR warfarin therapy regular monitoring effect require . The Hemochron Signature Elite portable micro coagulation system use point care ( POC ) anticoagulation monitoring device . Marketing focus accuracy , convenience efficiency deliver coagulation result . This study ass accuracy device calculate International Normalised Ratio ( INR ) result . This compare another INR result obtain sample via current gold standard test equipment Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) laboratories . The study include patient present surgery warfarin therapy stop within previous 7 day . Patients warfarin therapy require surgery currently identify preoperative assessment clinic , average 12 week prior date surgery . Anecdotally appear difference 'expected ' actual INR POC device use . Concern exist patient may inappropriately deny potential benefit central neural blockade ( CNB ) POC device provide falsely high result , conversely investigator may proceed CNB patient unacceptably high INR POC provide falsely low result . There also possibility improve hospital efficiency use device provide result much fast laboratory .</brief_summary>
