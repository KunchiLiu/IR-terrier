	<brief_summary>This trial randomize , single-blinded , sham-controlled study , patient blind treatment assignment . First , candidate underwent audiological test hearing threshold , tympanometry stapedius reflex test . The patient select study interview assess evaluate condition underwent detailed physical examination include complete otorhinolaryngologic examination complete blood test . Then , subject randomize undergo true sham ACP . Seven day ( baseline ) seven day twelve acupuncture ( ACP ) session ( six week ) , perform twice week , participant underwent 99mTc-ECD SPECT scanning complete Portuguese version Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAS ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . The purpose study integrate neuroscience research find clinical research tinnitus . Thus , randomize , single-blinded , placebo-controlled trial implement investigate effect ACP treatment tinnitus use ethylcysteine dimer single-photon emission computer tomography ( 99mTc-ECD SPECT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acupuncture ( ACP ) frequently use treat tinnitus , condition define perception sound absence external auditory stimulus . However , information available regard consequence ACP neural architecture functionality brain tinnitus patient . The aim study investigate change brain activity use ethylcysteine dimer single-photon emission computer tomography ( 99mTc-ECD SPECT ) patient tinnitus normal hearing underwent ACP treatment . Methods Findings : This randomize , single-blinded , sham-controlled study . The participant adult ( 18-60 year old ) either normal hearing chronic , idiopathic continuous ( + 3 month ) tinnitus . Fifty-seven ( 57 ) subject randomize receive true ( n=30 ) sham ( n=27 ) ACP , 99mTc-ECD SPECT exam perform seven day ( baseline ) seven day twelve ACP session ( six week ) , perform twice week . Secondary outcome include change Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAS ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . Data regard image outcome analyzed Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM8 ) software use factorial design . For secondary outcome , regression model build consider two different analytical paradigm : intention-to-treat ( ITT ; multiple imputation conduct due loss follow-up ) complete case . No significant difference brain perfusion observe patient underwent true versus sham ACP treatment . However , significant improvement THI score end true ACP treatment observe domain ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , exception catastrophic field . For outcome measurement ( VAS , BDI HAS ) , significant difference observe group . The small sample size represent potential limitation study . Conclusions : These finding suggest ACP may improve impact tinnitus daily life , although additional study need verify consequence ACP neural architecture functionality brain tinnitus patient .</detailed_description>
