	<brief_title>Effects Acthar Recovery From Cognitive Relapses MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label study Acthar administer treatment acute cognitive relapse . Primary secondary endpoint collect prior Acthar administration 3-month follow-up . Comparison make stable MS control group . The objective study : 1 . To replicate prior finding steroid therapy MS patient cognitive relapse , use instead Acthar Gel treat agent . The investigator determine decrease cognitive endpoint time relapse exceed stable MS control . 2 . To compare effect previously acquire dataset relapse patient treated steroid . This quasi-experimental design far steroid treat group data previously acquire separate study . The primary hypothesis study , due enhance melanocortin response Acthar recovery cognitive change occur cognitively focus relapse significant compare stable MS patient match age , time since test , cognitive performance SDMT . Target enrollment Acthar treatment group 30 MS patient care Jacobs Neurological Institute exist neuropsychological baseline past four year cognitive relapse new supratentorial GAD enhance lesion ( ) MRI identify . Cognitive relapse identify base clinical presentation acute worsen cognitive symptom domains process speed , concentration , episodic memory , work memory , and/or fatigue . Patients whose clinical MRI indicate new active GAD enhance lesion screen presence self-perceived cognitive decline , without new physical symptom . Thirty ( 30 ) clinically stable MS patient match age , time since test , cognitive performance SDMT recruit pool patient exist cognitive baseline .</detailed_description>
