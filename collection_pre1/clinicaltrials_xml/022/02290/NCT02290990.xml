	<brief_summary>Imaginative Distention ( ID ) propose supportive integrative intervention cope fatigue , ( principal end point ) , cope insomnia , stress perception improve QoL pw MS , insomnia pw health care personnel . ID safe easily learn practise without particular instrument also feasible disabled pw . This technique allow person experience body source well-being fatigue , pain disease . ID become self manage tool empowerment cope MS , reduce negative impact daily life job performance . Adherence pharmacological therapy could improve use ID . For pw MS ID could specific customizable rehabilitation implication improve motor disability , already see stroke patient . The principal end point trial verify ID efficacy fatigue specificity pw MS end training . For reason , ID efficacy test comparative term . Among possible comparison population , select : pw insomnia , stress related disease health personnel , risk stress . The control group comparison permit evaluate specificity ID pw MS . The three group randomise intervention wait list . The training 8 weekly session long . Self administer questionnaire fill participant train , 3-6 month later . The extent change outcome measure monitor expose group vs. unexposed allow separate non-disease specific effect ID MS-specific effect . The difference estimate allow determine extent true effect ID pw MS. All outcome measure compare among group mention time . The study would identify also important outcome measure MS patient question focus group . This aspect important could differs clinician researcher think .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic neurological disorder physical , emotional cognitive symptom . The diagnosis unpredictable variable nature disease profound social psychological impact person MS ( pw MS ) . Fatigue , depression disability independent determinant quality life ( QoL ) know different kind stress may impact disease activity . The `` Imaginative Distention '' ( ID ) mind-body technique combine relaxation , imagination motor imagery . ID derive Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique ( PMRT ) show effective fatigue MS cancer patient , well cognitive behavioural psychotherapy , include relaxation . Mind-body modality appear safe . ID easily learn practise without particular instrument also feasible disabled pw MS . The aim study evaluate effectiveness ID supportive integrative intervention cope MS. We plan first randomize control study ( RCT ) investigate effectiveness ID fatigue ( primary end point ) , disease specific QoL , insomnia , stress perception physiological parameter . The primary outcome change fatigue record post-intervention . Fatigue generically stress-related specifically disease-related component . To estimate effect ID specific MS-related component fatigue , also monitor two additional group subject , one insomnia ( fatigue poor QoL lesser impact health condition ) one generic stress ( health professional , fatigue normal poor QoL limit impact health condition ) . Each study group - MS , insomnia , health professional - randomise 1:1 intervention wait list . The design therefore parallel , randomised , control vs. intervention , open , stratified condition . Enrolment voluntary . All participant undergo pre-evaluation visit include four self administer questionnaire ( MFIS fatigue , VRS Verbal Rating Scale stress , ISI Insomnia Severity Index , MSQOL-54 Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life ) , EDSS Expanded Disability Status Scale brief cognitive screening pw MS. After randomization , ID practice group , week , two month . At end , pw MS involve focus group identify agreement investigator select patients-expected relevance outcome use study , well outcomes relevance patient monitor study , possibly implement future trial . Follow evaluation two , five eight month include EDSS self-administered questionnaire , five month , cognitive screening . If efficacy prove , ID could become tool empowerment cope MS , reduce negative impact daily life job performance , possibly , improve adherence pharmacological therapy .</detailed_description>
