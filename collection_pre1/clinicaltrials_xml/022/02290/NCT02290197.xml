	<brief_summary>Knee dislocation serious injury , usually cause high-energy trauma . It classically define complete loss articular congruence femur tibia , confirm radiography . However common reduction happen spontaneously . For reason , today investigator also consider patient suffer knee dislocation presence multi-ligament injury involve posterior cruciate ligament , often association anterior cruciate ligament , lateral and/or medial ligamentous complex . It consider serious injury , strong association vascular nerve damage , lead need limb amputation , difficulty obtain good functional outcome even treatment ligament injury . The treatment injury aim achieve knee stability . Joint mobility often sacrifice postoperative period , use immobilization cast , splint brace . Unfavorable clinical outcome high rate stiffness joint pain common patient . In attempt improve result , rehabilitation protocol early range motion employ . However , result may remain unsatisfactory , predominantly knee instability recurrence . Stannard Zaffagnini propose new model treatment acute knee dislocation . In model , multi-ligament reconstruction repair , knee articulate external fixator use . Such external fixator allow early aggressive joint mobility sagittal plane . Flexion extension permit , rotational movement , translation anterior-posterior plane , lateral ( varus ) medial ( valgus ) open allow . Thus protective stability ensure ligament reconstruction procedure . Simultaneously investigator allow immediate joint mobilization , reduce risk arthrofibrosis , joint stiffness postoperative ligament laxity . There consensus regard use hinge external fixator postoperatively multiple ligament reconstruction procedure treatment knee dislocation . The objective study compare functional outcome ligament reconstruction patient knee dislocation , without use hinge external fixator .</brief_summary>
