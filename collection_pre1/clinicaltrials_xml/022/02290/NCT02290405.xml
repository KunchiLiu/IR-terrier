	<brief_title>Impact Hyperarousal Simple Complex Cognitive Task Performance Among Insomnia Sufferers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary insomnia ( PI ) sufferer typically complain daytime impairment reduce attention , concentration , memory global mental acuity . Moreover , epidemiological study show PI contributes reduce productivity , work traffic accident , serious fall among elderly . Despite finding , laboratory-based effort corroborate cognitive complaint PI sufferer produce mixed result . Indeed , many study compare PI sufferer non-complaining normal sleeper across range neuropsychological test fail show relative deficit among PI group . Such finding , turn , lead impression PI patient cognitive complaint may over-stated result attentional bias toward minor cognitive error , dysfunctional belief impact insomnia function excessive self focus rather measurable daytime impairment . However , many previous study underpowered due small sample size employ neuropsychological test design detect impairment result brain disease/damage rather subtle albeit significant impairment PI patient complain . In recent research , others show PI sufferer , indeed , show great deficit ( slow variable reaction time ) particularly complex switch attention task . Moreover , preliminary evidence subgroup PI sufferer elevate level physiological hyperarousal prone suffer neuro-cognitive performance deficit match group PI sufferer physiologically hyperaroused normally alert individual without insomnia . For example , Fernandez-Mendoza recently show PI sufferer hyperarousal pattern suggest objective short sleep duration serial polysomnograms ( PSG ) perform poorly complex switch attention task normal sleeper PI sufferer normal objective sleep duration . In effort follow latter work , recently examine error rate alert sleepy PI sufferer normal sleeper across series simple complex reaction time task . We employ age gender match sample PI ( N=89 ) sufferer normal sleepers-NS ( N=95 ) . Participants underwent three night PSG follow daytime test four-trial Multiple Sleep Latency Test-MSLT . The PI NS group subdivide `` alert '' ( e.g. , MSLT mean onset latency &gt; 8 minute ) `` sleepy '' ( e.g. , MSLT mean onset latency &lt; 8 minute ) subgroups allow test main interaction effect participant type level alertness . `` Alert '' participant longer MSLT latencies `` sleepy '' participant ( 12.7 vs. 5.4 minute ) . PI sufferer fewer correct response performance test NS . However , show adjacent , figure find significant group x alertness interaction ( p = .0013 ) great error rate occur among alert ( hyperaroused ) PI sufferer ( Mean=4.5±3.6 error per trial ) among alert NS ( Mean=2.6±1.9 error per trial ) . This particularly true complex switch attention task . Our work along Fernandez-Mendoza serve confirm PI sufferer measureable objective neuro-cognitive deficit provide preliminary suggestion type test approach use detect . The identification test sensitive PI sufferer ' cognitive deficit particularly relevant test effect current future insomnia therapy patient ' objective daytime functioning . Measures daytime dysfunction serve endpoint assess benefit detriment insomnia therapy . In addition , recent work suggest subgroup PI sufferer may differ daytime deficit , show physiological hyperarousal prone make error . This finding suggest different type dos treatment may need reverse daytime impairment hyperaroused non-aroused PI patient . However , line research would benefit replication extension finding ( 1 ) confirm detrimental effect physiological hyperarousal PI sufferer 's neuro-cognitive functioning ; ( 2 ) identify broad range test use assess diurnal cognitive impairment physiologically hyperaroused less aroused PI group . The current project address aim .</detailed_description>
