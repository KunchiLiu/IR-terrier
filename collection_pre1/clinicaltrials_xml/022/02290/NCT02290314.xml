	<brief_summary>Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis forward displacement ( slip ) one vertebra adjacent vertebra result narrowing spinal canal compression exit nerve root . It commonly associate low back leg pain , frequent reason spine surgery particularly individual age 65 year . Recently novel minimally invasive surgical technique heighten public government interest tout benefit reduce approached-related morbidity turn lead quick recovery , short hospital stay , improve short-term clinical outcome , reduce health care cost . However , randomize control trial evidence describe actual advantage disadvantage associate minimally invasive spinal fusion . This pilot study randomize control trial compare minimally invasive MID-line Lumbar Fusion ( MIDLF ) traditional `` open '' posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF ) respect length stay , approach related morbidity , patient center outcome measure , cost-effectiveness treatment degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis .</brief_summary>
