	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether theory-based physical activity intervention maintain/improve moderate vigorous intensity physical activity measure via accelerometry new parent eight month child compare control group new parent . Hypothesis : The theory-based condition change salient underlie motif ( theory plan behaviour construct ) physical activity . Health-related fitness quality life also high condition comparison control condition . ( Note : improvement group mother may occur due recovery pregnancy , hypothesis still hold ) . All outcomes remain significantly high eight month theory-based condition compare standard condition</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clearly prevention chronic disease physical activity promotion important research area . Identifying critical life transition people 's physical activity behaviour may illuminate opportune intervention apertures chronic disease prevention . A substantive evidence base indicate parenthood one critical transition point physical activity decline . Our propose study examine whether brief , theory-based , cost-effective intervention help maintain/improve physical activity behaviours new parent first eight month parenthood experience . The study represent first couple-based physical activity initiative parenthood literature ; prior research focus mother show short-term change physical activity return baseline level approximately one month . In light potential couple provide important source social support parent within household , would seem remiss consider parent intervention direct evaluated dyadic level . Furthermore , couple-based intervention population health behaviour domains show effective individual-level intervention . The long-term impact study , result support hypothesis , utility prevent curb decline physical activity habit base finding . This research clear potential apply population-level knowledge translation source prenatal class , physician office , early parent learning/counselling avenue . Parents measure baseline ( 2 month post partum ) two assessment point six week ( 3.5 month post partum ) three month ( 5 month post partum ) final follow-up assessment six month later ( 8 month post partum ) . The content theory-based intervention derive result prior CDA SSHRC-funded longitudinal trial new parent use theory plan behaviour predict change physical activity , content use prior pilot-level study already successful change short-term physical activity mother 26-30 , content current CIHR-funded study physical activity goal planning . Primary Research Question 1 ) Does theory-based condition improve adherence regular physical activity among new parent compare control condition eight month birth first child ? Hypothesis : Adherence high parent theory-based condition comparison parent control condition control possible confounds . The adherence effect may wane time initial measurement period two month onset parenthood outcome remain significantly high eight month . Secondary Research Questions 1 . Does theory-based condition improve motivational , health-related quality life , health-related fitness outcome among new parent compare control condition eight month onset parenthood ? Hypothesis : The theory-based condition change salient underlie motif ( theory plan behaviour construct ) physical activity basis key result prior longitudinal trial new parent . Health-related fitness quality life , also high condition comparison control condition , ( footnote : improvement group mother may occur due recovery pregnancy , hypothesis still hold ) . All outcomes remain significantly high eight month theory-based condition compare standard physical activity education group . 2 . Can group difference among new parent regard motivational , behavioural , health-related fitness outcome explain mediation model ? Hypothesis : The covariance assign condition ( theory-based , standard ) adherence explain change salient underlie motif physical activity ( i.e. , manipulation check ) . In turn , covariance salient underlie motif health-related outcome explain physical activity adherence among condition . 3 . Can motivational variable predict adherence ? Do differ condition ? Hypothesis : The approach test Ajzen 's 39 theory plan behavior . Affective attitude perceive behavioural control predict intention , intention predict adherence across condition similar prior study population 41 . 4 . Is seasonal , initial physical activity status , mental health gender difference across primary outcome assign condition ? Hypothesis : No difference gender season hypothesize base lack evidence prior trial41 , exploratory research question limit research present make definitive statement . The examination whether intervention affect maintenance increase baseline physical activity via stratification baseline value also explore assessment baseline depression anxiety . Recruitment : We begin feasibility recruitment procedure last year order establish protocol , pilot intervention material . Based feasibility study , participant recruitment achieve active ( pregnancy class visit ) passive recruitment technique ( notice research poster ) . The active recruitment conduct community organization offer prenatal class program first-time parent . The project coordinator research assistant associate project main point contact potential participant . Organizations contact research coordinator ask interested give 10 minute time ( prenatal class , workshop ) .</detailed_description>
