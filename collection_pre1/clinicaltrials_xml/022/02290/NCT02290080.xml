	<brief_summary>Oxygen treatment widely use acutely ill patient , pre-hospital hospital . The indication oxygen sometimes unquestionable , many hypoxic patient , situation use practise much less base scientific evidence . In particular , oxygen treatment routinely use patient suspected heart attack variably recommend guideline , despite limit data support beneficial effect . Indeed , study even indicate oxygen treatment might harmful . Immediate re-opening acutely blocked artery heart muscle treatment choice limit permanent injury . However , sudden re-initiation blood flow achieve primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , reopen stenting blocked vessel , give rise endothelial myocardial damage , so-called reperfusion injury . Ischemia reperfusion associate myocardial injury ( IR-injury ) involve wide range pathological process . Vascular leakage , activation cell death program , thrombocytes white blood cell lead extended inflammation formation clot examples effect . The role oxygen treatment pathological process , extent IR-injury final infarct size patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) previously study . In ongoing national multicentre , randomize , registry base clinical trial , DETO2X-AMI trial ( NCT01787110 ) , effect oxygen morbidity mortality ACS patient investigate . The present DETO2X-biomarkers study substudy DETO2X-AMI trial , evaluate effect oxygen treatment biological system involve pathogenesis reversible irreversible myocardial damage cell death ACS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The DETermination role OXygen suspect Acute Myocardial Infarction ( DETO2X-AMI ) trial ( NCT01787110 ) , ongoing multicentre , randomize , registry base clinical trial , investigate effect oxygen morbidity mortality ACS patient . The present DETO2X-biomarkers study substudy DETO2X-AMI trial , evaluate effect oxygen treatment biological system involve pathogenesis reversible irreversible myocardial damage cell death ACS . AIMS To evaluate effect oxygen treatment marker oxidative stress ACS patient . To assess effect oxygen treatment soluble marker apoptosis , MMPs TIMPs ACS patient . To study effect oxygen treatment systemic inflammatory activity leukocyte activation . To evaluate effect oxygen treatment platelet activation ACS patient . HYPOTHESIS The main hypothesis oxygen treatment enhances oxidative stress , systemic inflammation , marker apoptosis MMPs ACS patient , thereby potentially increase myocardial damage cell death , worsen prognosis . STUDY DESIGN POPULATION The present study biomarker substudy DETO2X-AMI trial . The design population DETO2X-AMI trial previously describe detail ( NCT01787110 ) . All patient include DETO2X-AMI trial Södersjukhuset Stockholm University Hospital Linköping study period specify also eligible include DETO2X-biomarkers study . We intend include 150 patient suspect AMI . STUDY PLAN All study participant DETO2X-biomarkers study allocate receive oxygen ( 6L/min ) oxygen treatment part DETO2X-AMI trial . To variable degree , participant already start treatment enter biomarker substudy . Baseline blood sample collect soon possible inclusion DETO2X-AMI trial , preferably prior initiation oxygen treatment . Study subject continue receive allocate DETO2X-AMI study treatment . A second set blood sample collect 5-7 hour randomisation DETO2X-AMI trial , always prior discontinuation oxygen treatment . ANALYSIS blood sample As marker oxidative stress , plasma-isoprostane measure use gas chromatography combine massspectrometric detector . Soluble marker apoptosis , MMP-2 TIMP-2 analyze Luminex . Plasma inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein ( CRP ) interleukin ( IL ) -6 ) , myeloperoxidase , marker platelet activation analyse ELISA . Flow cytometry use analyse neutrophil integrin receptor platelet-leukocyte aggregate whole blood . Whole blood fixate red blood cell lysed analysis . EFFICACY OUTCOME To determine effect oxygen treatment biomarkers oxidative stress , apoptosis , matrix metalloproteinases , marker inflammation , leukocyte platelet activation patient admitted hospital due suspect AMI . SUMMARY The DETO2X-AMI trial address effect oxygen morbidity mortality ACS patient . The present DETO2X-biomarkers substudy evaluate effect oxygen treatment biological system involve pathogenesis reversible irreversible myocardial damage cell death ACS may add essential new knowledge mechanistics ischaemic myocardial injury .</detailed_description>
