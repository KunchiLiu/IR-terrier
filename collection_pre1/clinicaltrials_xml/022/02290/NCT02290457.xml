	<brief_summary>Background : It demonstrate core strength train effective mean enhance trunk muscle strength ( TMS ) athletic performance youth . However , role instability core strength training unresolved youth . This study specifically investigate effect core stability ( CST ) compare core instability strength training ( CIST ) physical fitness adolescent . Methods : Twenty-seven ( 14 girl , 13 boy ) healthy adolescent ( age 14±1 year ) assign CST ( n=13 ) CIST ( n=14 ) group . Both training program last 6 week ( 2 sessions/week ) include frontal , dorsal , lateral core exercise . During CIST , exercise conduct unstable surface ( e.g. , TOGU© DYNAIR CUSSIONS , THERA-BAND© STABILITY TRAINER ) . Expected Results : Based select result report literature , hypothesize participant perform CIST compare CST show large improvement physical fitness test ( i.e. , strength , speed , flexibility , coordination , balance ) follow training . Of note , train induced gain strength , speed , flexibility , coordination , balance vital importance sport performance , everyday activity , injury prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adaptations follow core strength training perform stable ( CST ) compare unstable surface condition ( CIST ) assess pre- versus post-test design . The training period last 6 week induce train induce change measure strength , speed , flexibility , coordination , balance . These health ( i.e. , strength , flexibility ) skill-related ( i.e. , balance , coordination , speed ) components physical fitness assess use physical fitness test ( i.e. , Bourban TMS test , stand long jump test , 20-m sprint test , stand-and-reach test , jump sideways test , Emery balance test , Y balance test ) . Twenty-seven healthy adolescent boy girl participate study experimental procedure explain . An priori power analysis assume Type I error 0.05 Type II error rate 0.20 ( 80 % statistical power ) calculate measure trunk muscle strength reveal 13 participant per group would 105 sufficient observe medium Test x Group interaction effect . Study participant recruit local sport club . Both core strength training program supervise conduct 2 experienced physiotherapist . The two program organize circuit training instructor supervise 6-7 participant . Both train program comprise 2 training session per week total 12 training session intervention group . Each training session last 30 min , start brief warm-up program mainly consist core strength exercise moderate intensity end cool-down program ( i.e. , dynamic stretching ) . During main part training , group mainly conduct `` big 3 '' exercise describe McGill . These include curl-up , side bridge , quadruped position . In word , every single training session consist frontal , dorsal , lateral core exercise . The difference 2 intervention group CIST protocol comprise core exercise conduct unstable element ( e.g. , TOGU© DYNAIR PRO , SENSO , TOGU© REDONDO BALLS , TOGU© POWERBALLS , THERA-BAND© STABILITY TRAINER , THERA-BAND© EXERCISE BALL ) , whereas CST program contain exercise stable surface . Prior test , participant perform standardize 5-minutes warm-up consist bipedal monopedal balance , submaximal plyometric , skip exercise . Thereafter , physical fitness test ( i.e. , Emery balance test , Y balance test , stand-and-reach test , 20-m sprint test , jump sideways test , stand long jump test , Bourban TMS test ) assess . A multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) use detect difference study group baseline variable . The effect core strength training variable physical fitness analyse separate 2 ( Group : CST , CIST ) x 2 ( Test : pre , post ) ANOVA repeat measure test . When Test x Group interaction reach level significance , group-specific post hoc test ( i.e. , pair t-tests ) conduct identify comparison statistically significant . Additionally , classification effect size ( f ) determine calculate partial eta square .</detailed_description>
