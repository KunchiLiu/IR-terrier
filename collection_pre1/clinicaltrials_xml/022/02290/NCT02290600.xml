	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Using Run-to-Run Control Optimize Continuous Glucose Sensor Bias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose 12 week study see much accurate continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) might personalize sensor calibration algorithm individual . The calibration algorithm mathematical calculation build CGM . Currently , CGM ask regular blood test ( finger stick ) measurement twice day order make calibration algorithm accurate . Our goal keep refining calculate ability provide personalize blood sugar control throughout day individual use sensor CGM .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment ; C peptide level antibody determination need . Actively use insulin pump ( CSII therapy ) last 6 month , continue use insulin pump throughout trial . Age 18 75 year . For female , currently know pregnant nursing . HbA1c &lt; 9.5 % , measure DCA2000 equivalent device . Willing perform calibration study CGMs use finger stick willing follow instruction CGM wear . Able agrees avoid follow medication start 24 hour sensor wear completion study : acetaminophen , prednisone . An understanding willingness follow protocol sign inform consent . Pregnancy ( determine positive blood pregnancy test perform female childbearing capacity screen visit phase II ) nursing mother . Diabetic ketoacidosis past 6 month prior enrollment require emergency room visit hospitalization . Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 6 month prior enrollment . Current treatment seizure disorder : Subjects history seizure may include study receive write clearance neurologist . A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol cognitive deficit . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , include subject able read write . Active coronary artery disease heart failure Active gastroparesis If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study . Uncontrolled thyroid disease : Adequately treat thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment . Abuse alcohol . A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication disease judgment investigator affect completion protocol . Current use beta blocker medication . Laboratory result : Hematocrit &lt; 30 % &gt; 55 % . A1C â‰¥ 9.5 % Abnormal liver renal function ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) Labs drawn screen visit within two month prior screen ( purpose ) suffice enrollment purpose . Subject skin condition , determination investigator , would preclude wear study device ( CGM sensor ) , abdomen upper buttock . Examples include limited : psoriasis , burn , scar , eczema , tattoo , significant hypertrophy site device wear ; know allergy medical adhesive . Current participation another investigational trial previously participate study . However , study , augment calibration algorithm modify data need update calibration algorithm , subject allow reconsent additional study judgment investigator . Similarly , miss data data collection due device failure , transmission error problem , subject allow extend time require continue phase per judgment investigator exclude continue study .</criteria>
