	<brief_title>Creatine , Exercise Inflammatory Markers Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants provide informed consent , complete participant information knee demographic form , undergo radiographic evaluation confirm eligibility . Baseline evaluation ( 1 ) systemic inflammation ; ( 2 ) knee joint pain function complete . Following baseline evaluation , participant randomly assign 1 3 group use online software available http : //www.randomizer.org/ : 1 . Exercise group : Participants exercise 30 minute low-load walking condition 3x per week 12 consecutive week Lower Body Positive Pressure ( LBPP ) treadmill ( Alter-G Inc - Menlo Park , CA ) set speed 3.1 mph 0⁰ incline . The initial five minute exercise session use warm-up allow participant reach target heart rate , accommodate walk treadmill 's belt surface , facilitate adjustment LBPP within treadmill 's air chamber percentage unweighting eliminates substantially reduce participant 's acute knee pain duration 30 minute walking session . Subjects blind amount LBPP use un-weight low-load walking session . 2 . Creatine group : Participants supplement regular diet creatine monohydrate 12 consecutive week . In week # 1 , participant ingest 5 gram creatine monohydrate 4x per day total ingestion 20 gram per day . For remain 11 week , participant consume 5 gram creatine monohydrate per day maintain increase concentration creatine . 3 . Placebo group : Participants placebo group supplement regular diet maltodextrin ( inert sugar base molecule ) 12 consecutive week . In week # 1 , participant ingest 5 gram maltodextrin 4x per day total ingestion 20 gram per day . They ingest 5 gram maltodextrin per day remain 11 week . All data collection take place Pan Am Clinic , multidisciplinary tertiary care hospital research facility serve Winnipeg Regional Health Authority 's `` Centre Excellence Musculoskeletal Injury Assessment Treatment '' . This project utilize combine asset University Manitoba Pan Am Clinic access medical resource use daily basis diagnosis , treatment , long term management patient knee OA . All participant undergo follow-up evaluation 13 week initial baseline evaluation . Aim # 1 : Determine knee OA systemic inflammation significantly decrease follow completion 12 week creatine supplementation low-load treadmill walk exercise regimen . Hypotheses : - There significant decrease systemic inflammation follow completion 12 week creatine supplementation program . - There significant decrease systemic inflammation follow completion 12 week low-load walking exercise program . - There decrease systemic inflammation follow completion 12 week placebo supplementation program . Primary Outcome Measures : Systemic inflammation evaluate obtain venous blood sample participant . Blood sample ( approximately 20 mL ) drawn venipuncture antecubital vein cool ( 4°C ) vacutainer tube contain EDTA sterile condition . After inversion , tube centrifuge 1065g 15 minute 4°C . Approximately 8 mL plasma aliquoted Eppendorf tube ( 8 x 1 mL per tube ) freeze -80°C analysis . All plasma sample evaluate C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) use enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit accord manufacturer 's instruction . All assay analyze duplicate within microplate reduce variation . Serum obtain draw blood sample venipuncture vacutainer serum separator tube . This serum use analyze serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( sCOMP ) use ELISA kit accord manufacturer 's instruction . Aim # 2 : Determine knee OA joint pain function significantly alter follow completion 12 week creatine supplementation low-load treadmill walk exercise regimen . Hypotheses : - There significant decrease knee OA joint pain dysfunction follow completion 12 week creatine supplementation program . - There significant decrease knee OA joint pain dysfunction follow completion 12 week low-load walking exercise program . - There significant decrease knee OA joint pain dysfunction follow completion 12 week placebo supplementation program . Primary Outcome Measures : Knee pain normal activity daily live ( ADLs ) evaluate use Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire . The KOOS self-administered , knee-specific questionnaire design measure OA patient 's knee pain previous seven-day period . Testing indicate valid , highly reliable responsive measurement tool evaluate change different OA intervention . Secondary Outcome Measures : Bilateral knee joint function physical health evaluate follow measure pre post study : 1 . Goniometric assessment knee joint range motion ( ROM ) clinically accepted procedure evaluate joint function . It allow reliable accurate quantification movement use linear ( cm ) angular unit ( degree ) . 2 . Isokinetic evaluation thigh muscle strength gold standard method use quantify thigh muscle strength OA knee joint longitudinal clinical investigation , well examine effect creatine exercise intervention patient knee OA . 3 . Measurement cardiovascular ( CV ) capacity via maximum volume oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) testing . VO2 max test ass maximum amount oxygen person consume per minute maximum work rate consider best measure cardiovascular health .</detailed_description>
