	<brief_summary>The study carry Sahlgrenska University Hospital patient population consist woman refer symptomatic bothersome post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse least 1 cm beyond hymeneal remnant . The intervention either vaginal sacrospinousfixation laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy follow randomization one type surgery . The primary outcome anatomical failure base clinical assessment . Failure define clinically , accord Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system , Ba , C Bp hymen maximum Valsalva maneuver one two year surgery . Secondary outcome evaluation continence , sexual function prolapse symptom base validated questionnaire 1 , 2 , 5 10 year surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Vaginal Vault Prolapse After Hysterectomy : Comparison Two Surgical Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The lifetime risk pelvic floor surgery prolapse likely 10 % 15 % , large number patient previously underwent hysterectomy develop vaginal vault prolapse . There evidence 2 % woman hysterectomy would require surgery vault prolapse . There many different technique use correction vault prolapse evidence lack use guide mainly tradition singe institution . There evidence indicate laparoscopic surgery superior vaginal approach . Symptoms prolapse significantly associate avulsion injury patient hysterectomy . Our aim compare , 1- 2-years follow-up examination patient post-hysterectomy prolapse , efficacy two standard surgical procedure vaginal vault prolapse : sacrospinous vaginal colpopexy ( Richter procedure ) native tissue vaginal repair ( sacrospinous fixation , SSF ) laparoscopic colposacropexy mesh . This single-center , randomize control trial two standard surgical procedure vaginal vault prolapse routinely use institution.Both procedure design treat vault prolapse , one mesh implantation laparoscopy vaginal repair apical fixation sacrospinous ligament , usually right . All patient refer gynecological unit ( Ob/Gyn Department Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg ) symptomatic vault prolapse fulfil inclusion criterion ask participate study . Eligible inclusion : post-hysterectomy patient least two-compartment prolapse ( affected apical/vault compartment , stage II high Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system ( POP-Q ) ) , suffer symptom prolapse , request pelvic floor reconstructive surgery , diagnose vault prolapse . Excluded : patient prolapse uterus place , request pelvic floor surgery , patient understand Swedish capable fulfill follow procedure . Patients undergo identical pre- postoperative assessment procedure , include POP-Q examination maximum Valsalva maneuver , archive Case Report Form , validate questionnaire PFDI-20 , PFIQ-7 PISQ-12 . The study approve regional ethic committee subject obtain write informed consent participate . To minimize bias decide follow examination go performed gynecologist perform surgery . All patient end participation study moment . The randomization process carry computer , use patient social security number , time enrollment ( usually 2-3 month surgery ) . Patients informed allocation randomization . Both procedure perform experienced surgeon , patient general anesthesia laparoscopic procedure regional anesthesia sacrospinous fixation . Patients follow 3 months,1 year 2 year postoperatively . These postoperative clinical examination perform single examiner , involved surgical procedure . The vaginal descent assess maximum Valsalva maneuver . In case recurrence prolapse distress symptom patient desire resolve , reoperation prolapse plan accord clinical praxis department . The primary outcome measure anatomical failure base clinical assessment . Failure define clinically Ba , C Bp hymen , maximum Valsalva maneuver . As secondary outcome measure use continence status , sexual function prolapse symptom base validated questionnaire : Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire ( PFIQ - 7 ) , Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Questionnaire - Short Form 20 ( PFDI-20 ) , Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire ( PISQ-12 ) quality life base Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey . The power calculation base primary outcome measure available data lead u expect failure rate 25 % sacrospinous fixation group 10 % failure laparoscopy group . To detect expect difference 15 % group , 80 % power test 70 patient require group .</detailed_description>
