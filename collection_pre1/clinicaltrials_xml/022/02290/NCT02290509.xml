	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Flublok Quadrivalent v IIV4 Adults 18-49 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As spectrum influenza vaccine rapidly evolve quadrivalent formulation intention offer broad protection include lineage influenza B strain , appropriate transition Flublok trivalent quadrivalent formulation . The demonstration non-inferior post-vaccination Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay ( HAI ) Geometric Mean Titers ( GMTs ) antigens Flublok Quadrivalent formulation compare match antigen US - approve IIV4 intend support licensure Flublok Quadrivalent adult population Flublok trivalent currently approve . The comparison safety reactogenicity Flublok Quadrivalent IIV4 expect confirm similar safety profile .</detailed_description>
