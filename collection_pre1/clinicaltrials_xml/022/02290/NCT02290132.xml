	<brief_title>ATG Could Improve Outcome Of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients With Highly Aggressive T Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aggressive T-cell lymphoma ( ATCLs ) , include peripheral T-cell lymphoma T lymphoblastoid cell lymphoma/leukemia , represent 10 % 15 % non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHLs ) adult ( 1 ) . ATCLs show bad prognosis B-cell lymphoma . Myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT ) may way cure patient , recurrence primary disease transplantation still important prognostic factor ( 2 ) . Optimizing condition regimen always research hot topic hematology field . Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin ( rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin , r-ATG ) currently use prevent graft-versus -host ( GVHD ) disease allogeneic stem cell transplantation , also widely use prevention treatment acute rejection solid organ transplant strong immunomodulatory effect . ATG use allogeneic SCT prophylaxis graft versus host disease vivo T cell depletion , include complement-dependent cytotoxic response , antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity , opsonophagocytic role phagocytic cell induce apoptosis ( 3 ) . But scholar report ATG delay immune reconstitution hematologic reconstitution lead increase incidence virus fungal infection transplantation . But often curable affect overall survival quality life patient ( 4 ) . Because strong immune suppression regulation , also basis fact , ATG GVHD prophylaxis generally limit unrelated donor , human leukocyte antigen（HLA）-mismatched related donor transplantation . But There many issue still need study . ATG show efficacy prevent acute GVHD（aGVHD ) allo-SCT , efficacy chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) long-term outcome remain controversial . A systematic review meta-analysis Du k et al（5） report prophylactic use ATG exert favorable effect reduce cGVHD without survival impairment long term , although high relapse rate major threat . Does ATG also kill effect tumor cell lymphatic system ? The vitro study confirm point recently . Grüllich ( 6 ) et al investigator study ( 7 ) find ATG inhibit proliferation induce high level apoptosis human lymphoblastic cell line , Jurkat , Daudi , DG-75 , myeloblastic cell line K562 , HL-60 , KG1 , U937 . ATG also pro-apoptotic activity majority primary leukemia cell , particularly cell lymphatic origin . In addition , ATG result apoptosis normal hematopoietic cell . Low-dose ATG also stimulate normal hematopoietic colony growth . Therefore , ATG may use anti-lymphocyte tumor bio-therapeutics ( rituximab ) increase role chemo-radiotherapy condition regimen . And ATG remove residual tumor lesion , reduce rate tumor recurrence transplantation . Although vitro study clarify role ATG tumor cell lymphatic system , relevant report anti-tumor effect ATG allo-SCT publish . Further clinical observation need conduct . As noted early , high relapse rate may major threat ATG use（5）.In China , conventional dose 2.5mg/kg/day , 2-3 day Thymoglobulin commonly use GVHD prophylaxis unrelated donor , HLA-mismatched relate donor transplantation HLA match related donor transplantation ( 8 ) . In order observe anti-tumor effect condition regimen aggressive T-cell lymphoma patient ( include peripheral T-cell lymphoma T lymphoblastoid cell lymphoma/leukemia , complete remission , partial remission , relapse remission refractory recurrent invasive patient ) , investigator improve drug condition regimen increase Thymoglobulin dose condition regimen four day 10mg/kg total even HLA match related donor transplantation . The purpose clinical trial reduce incidence GVHD time increase recurrence primary disease . The investigator expect ATG base conditioning regimen play anti-tumor effect , reduce primary disease recurrence transplantation , improve disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival rate ( OS ) , well reduce incidence severity GVHD , incidence infection need observe .</detailed_description>
