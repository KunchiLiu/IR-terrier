	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Randomized study provide evidence concern overall survival breast conserving surgery ( BCS ) combine postoperative radiotherapy equally effective modify mastectomy ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Postoperative radiation decrease local relapse rate ( 1 , 2 ) highly significantly comparison BCS alone ( 3 ) . The recent metaanalysis Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group ( EBCTCG ( 3 ) ) show avoidance 4 local relapse 5 year prevent one death 15 year ( 4 1 rule ) . Several study past demonstrated complete omission radiotherapy fail term local tumor control . Fyles et al . ( 4 ) show local relapse rate 8 % within low risk group patient tumor pathological stage T1/T2 &gt; 50 year age treat BCS antihormonal treatment ( AHT ) . By add postoperative whole breast radiation ( WBRT ) rate local relapse reduce 1 % 5 year . This effect also see elderly patient small tumor . Hughes et al . ( 5 ) observe low local relapse rate 4 % patient treat AHT BCS vs. 1 % patient additional WBRT 4 year , evaluate low-risk group patient tumor &lt; 2 cm &gt; 70 year age . Apparently , patient benefit postoperative WBRT . However , due fact 90 % local relapse breast conserve therapy localize close primary tumor , might possible treat select group patient relatively low risk local recurrence tumor bed irradiation . Polgar et al . ( 6 ) provide evidence non-inferiority accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) comparison WBRT small randomize trial . Very recently TARGIT-A data ( 9 , 10 ) report non-inferior efficacy tumor bed irradiation single dose intraoperative radiation ( Intrabeam System , Carl Zeiss Oberkochen ) compare WBRT regard local relapse . By use Intrabeam System , intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) give surgery protection surround tissue apply biologically highly effective dose tissue adjacent tumor . Advantages IORT high precision regard beam application , possibility protection skin prevention tumor cell proliferation time interval breast conserving surgery adjuvant WBRT well fractionate WBRT . By manually position applicator tumor bed geographic miss exclude radiation risk structure like heart lung avoid . Therefore , possible give high single fraction target minimize relevant side effect . 2 . Aim The objective single arm phase IV study investigate efficacy single intraoperative radiotherapy treatment within low risk patient ( ≥ 50 year , cT1 small cT2 ( &lt; 3.5 cm ) , cN0 , cM0 , invasive-ductal , hormone receptor positive ) follow WBRT risk factor present . The primary endpoint rate local relapse ( within 2 cm initial tumor ) ; secondary endpoint ipsi- contralateral breast cancer , cancer specific overall survival . Of interest cosmetic outcome Quality Life . Therefore , patient ≥ 50 year small , histologically verify hormone receptor positive invasive-ductal breast cancer ( clinically cT1 small T2 ≤ 3.5 cm ) without risk factor ( multifocality/- centricity , extensive intraductal component ( EIC ) , lymph vessel invasion ( L1 ) , clinically positive lymph node ) receive BCS recruit . After tumor resection free margin &gt; 1 mm applicator exactly position tumor bed minimum distance skin 5 mm . The prescription dose 20 Gy surface applicator . The treatment time depend diameter applicator last 20-50 minute . After radiation applicator remove operation finish usual . The biologic effectiveness 20 Gy prescribed operation equivalent 70 Gy normo-fractionated irradiation accord radiobiological modelling . If final histopathological report provide evidence different histology risk factor , extensive intraductal component ( EIC ) , lymph vessel invasion ( L1 ) , multifocality/-centricity resection margin &lt; 2 mm , patient receive postoperative WBRT 46 Gy ( delay least 5 week ) . Depending lymph node status postoperative WBRT perform 50 Gy ( pN1 ) WBRT include lymphatic drainage 50 Gy ( ≥ pN2 ) . A re-resection perform presence insufficient free margin ( e.g . tumor ink , margin &lt; 2mm depend local policy ) follow WBRT 50 Gy omit boost . Cosmetic outcome toxicity evaluation perform chart ( CTC LENT-SOMA score ) standardize photo documentation . For Quality Life assessment patient complete two standardize validated questionnaire develop EORTC ( European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ) . The questionnaire include 53 question take approximately 10 minute fill clinic visit . Therefore , patient group include patient ≥ 50 year low-risk tumor profile treat single-arm study intraoperative radiotherapy tumor bed , use well establish method ( Intrabeam System , Carl Zeiss Surgical , Oberkochen , Germany ) order optimize radiotherapy treatment breast conserve surgery term local relapse , toxicity , overall survival quality life .</detailed_description>
