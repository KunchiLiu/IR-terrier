	<brief_title>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) Versus Omega-Loop Gastric Bypass ( OLGB ) Safety Efficacy Short-term Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Obesity risk factor Diabetes , Ischemic heart disease , Stroke , Hypertensive heart disease , 6th , 1st , 2nd , 10th leading cause death accord WHO . Bariatric Metabolic Surgery Efficient reasonably Safe method Treatment Severe Obesity , Type 2 Diabetes ( T2DM ) Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) . Existing knowledge : Metabolic procedure , e.g . Gastric bypass , effective treatment T2DM predominantly `` restrictive '' procedure , e.g . Gastric Banding . RYGB one prevalent procedures world Europe . In USA , RYGB consider `` golden standard '' bariatric surgery . In recent decade , simpler variant Gastric bypass , i.e . OLGB , propose . Proponents OLGB argue less complication seem high durable effect weight reduction T2DM improvement . Opponents OLGB concern chronic exposure gastric esophageal mucosa bile , see animal experiment patient operate gastric cancer peptic ulcer disease , pose severe health risk . So far , concern confirm OLGB patient . Only one Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) two intervention perform , conclude OLGB simpler safer similar Efficacy 2 year surgery . Need trial : A grow evidence support efficacy safety bariatric metabolic surgery treatment severe obesity T2DM . Therefore , bariatric surgery frequently perform . However , little evidence randomize trial compare different bariatric procedure - come retrospective cohort , might suffer bias . As result , choice bariatric procedure particular patient base largely preference experience particular surgeon , rather evidence best benefit particular patient . Although efficacy safety RYGB well establish , new variant less frequently employ bariatric procedure might offer preferable Efficacy Safety profile patient . Some evidence suggest OLGB might promise procedure , `` simpler safer similar efficacy '' comparison RYGB , technically demand procedure . This study contribute rigorous evidence define relative strength weaknesses OLGB compare `` gold standard '' RYGB . Objectives : The purpose study objectively compare efficacy RYGB OLGB weight , T2DM obesity-related comorbidities . Furthermore , study aim provide insight safety OLGB RYGB measure incidence complication abnormal finding Gastroscopy .</detailed_description>
