	<detailed_description>Background : Patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery often experience range problem symptom related procedure underlie heart disease . These problem include anxiety depressive symptom , immobility issue , complication wound seeping , neck shoulder pain , interrupt insufficient sleep . Over last 2 decade , cardiac rehabilitation become recognize significant component continuum care person cardiovascular disease . Furthermore , cardiac rehabilitation undergone significant evolution move focus exercise intervention comprehensive disease management program . In Guidelines Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery cardiac rehabilitation describe include early ambulation hospitalisation outpatient prescriptive exercise training begin 6-8 week follow surgery . Our hypothesis comprehensive rehabilitation programme include physical exercise moderate intensity psycho-educative component begin early postoperative phase hospitalising . No study test combined intervention phase 1 rehabilitation coronary artery bypass graft surgery patient . However , randomise trial either physical mental part conduct positive result , evidence lacking combine intervention . Before large randomised trial set pilot trial conduct evaluate feasibility patient recruitment intervention : test safety tolerability intervention patient provide outcome data sample size calculation . The SheppHeartCABG pilot show trial feasibility , safety sufficient inclusion rate high compliance element . Outcome data pilot trial use sample size power calculation randomise clinical trial . Objective : The objective trial investigate benefit harm phase 1 comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme consist exercise-training psycho-educative component , include plus treatment usual patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting . Design : SheppHeartCABG investigator-initiated randomised clinical trial 1:1 randomisation two site comprehensive physical psycho-educative rehabilitation programme plus usual care usual care alone , blind outcome assessment . Population : Patients 18 year old ischaemic heart disease , undergo elective coronary artery bypass grafting , speak understand Danish provide write informed consent include . The following patient exclude trial : patient intermediate high risk cardiovascular status accord guideline , patient neurological orthopaedic deficit prevent train patient wish participate . Number participant : 326 participant include . Interventions : All patient - intervention group control group - receive usual care . Patients allocate experimental group receive rehabilitation programme consist physical exercise psycho-education . The control group receive usual care alone . The physical exercise consist ; breathe exercise without use incentive spirometry expiratory positive pressure airway , walk cycling exercise neck/shoulder exercise hospitalisation exercise programme run discharge 4 week follow surgery . The psycho-educative rehabilitation programme consist four psycho-educative consultation specially trained nurse . The last consultation take place 4 week follow surgery . Outcomes : Primary outcome physical capacity measure 6-minute walk test 4 week follow surgery . Secondary outcome ; perceive mental physical ( SF 12 ) , health-related quality life ( HeartQoL ) , anxiety depression ( HADS ) , sleep ( PSQI ) , pain ( Ã–MPSQ ) leg endurance strength ( sit stand test ) . Explorative outcome ; fatigue ( MFI-20 ) , physical activity ( IPAQ ) , cognitive emotional representation illness ( B-IPQ ) self-rated health ( EQ-5D ) . Safety : There previous report risk associate psycho-educational consultation . Physical exercise test extensively patient heart disease consider safe meet applicable requirement safety training cardiac patient . The intervention consider safe patient low risk accord cardiovascular status . Ethical consideration : The trial perform accordance Declaration Helsinki late form . All patient must give informed consent prior participation trial initiate approval Danish Data Protection Agency regional ethic committee . The trial register www.clinicalTrials.gov randomisation first participant .</detailed_description>
