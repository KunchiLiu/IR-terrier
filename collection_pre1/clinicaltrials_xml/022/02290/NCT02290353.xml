	<brief_summary>The investigator assemble integrated knowledge/technology/client team develop novel motion capture-based home therapy program child hemiparesis ( cerebral palsy , acquire brain injury ( ABI ) ) old person post-stroke . The investigator society need new approach improve quality life million Canadians . The method proposaed combine low-cost motion capture device , bimanual training program , social medium framework Facebook Games , on-line performance share therapy client therapist . The investigator believe together approaches yield intervention people stroke child hemiplegia significantly improve motivation continue exercise program thus improve functional ability lead improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A ) Purpose : The similarity functional impairment two target hemiplegic population , teenager hemiparetic cerebral palsy CP acquire brain injury ( post-acute phase ) hemiparetic stroke survivor , lead u pursue unify rehabilitation strategy . Although age-dependency clearly factor rate motor learning , intensive therapy show similar return function similar intensity length treatment across different population [ 1 ] . By involve adult child study , investigator directly compare effect identical intervention use innovative hardware software solution develop . The team investigator develop system include camera ( PS3 Eye ) , 2 modify PS3 Move controller , computer [ 2 ] . A software design search camera feed find glow ball attach two PS3 Move controller , change position computer 's mouse cursor base position two glowing ball . This allow participant play simple 2D Facebook game involve point-and-click hold Move controller move arm space order control cursor play game . B ) Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize follow strategy deliver effective , long-term therapy : ( 1 ) use bimanual approach , base recent research show powerful integrative value involve limbs cerebral hemisphere recovery function post-stroke [ 3 ] ; ( 2 ) target hand-function , follow proven efficacy approach ( CIMT GRASP ) exercise arm motion ; ( 3 ) directly target patient motivation embed therapy social construct multi-user online game Facebook Games [ 4 , 5 ] . C ) Justification : The quality life Canadians stroke decline 1998 2005 , disturb find directly relate impaired arm function [ 6 ] . Traditional ( standard ) physical therapy include range intervention aim improving posture , joint range motion , muscle tone , muscle strength motor control . However , single approach proven superior effectiveness upper low limb recovery . These sober data illustrate critical need novel intervention improve function lead well quality life person live hemiplegia . Motor rehabilitation program base low-cost exercise device Nintendo Wii , Nike Fit Microsoft Kinect proven efficacy [ 5 ] , participant require room time . Online game Farmville Facebook support cooperative task , appropriate device support bimanual input . Our approach fill gap support collaborative , bilateral motor-learning involves force movement therapy social medium effectively . D ) Objectives : Our objective demonstrate motivation adherence therapy regimen enhance use online game conjunction motion capture device require user interact bimanually game . Our project 4 phase , milestone : 1 . Start-up : In-clinic focus group meeting rehabilitation professional follow-on focus group therapy client ; design hardware software base outcomes focus group meeting ( month M1-M9 ) . This phase finish . 2 . Pilot study : Hardware software development ( M10-12 ) , follow in-clinic usability study adult stroke survivor child hemiplegia ; development final hardware software base outcomes usability study ; integrative Knowledge Transition activity ( month M7-M24 ) . This phase finish . 3 . Home-based study : Two parallel 6-month study , one adult one teenager ( month M25-M30 ) . The investigator finish plan phase receive ethic approval start recruit . 4 . Knowledge translation : Data analysis , report dissemination ( month M30-M36 ) E ) Research Method ( Only Phase 3 include ) : The study randomize cross-over design early late intervention group . A maximum 20 stroke survivor divide late intervention early intervention group ( 10 group , randomly assign ) , maximum 20 teen hemiplegia divide late intervention early intervention group ( 10 group , randomly assign ) . The procedure late intervention group . Similarly , procedure early intervention group . Note study ask research question two different clinical population . Each intervention group involve study 6 month . Both group start baseline assessment outcome measure week 1 . The early intervention group receive FEATHERS intervention week 1-8 . There another round outcome measure assessment end week 8 ( assess motor recovery ) . There period intervention week 9-16 , follow another round outcome measure assessment ( assess retention ) . Finally , week 17-24 also intervention period , follow another round outcome measure assessment ( assess variation outcomes even without therapy intervention ) . The late intervention group receive 2 month intervention follow round outcome measure assessment ( assess variation outcomes even without therapy intervention ) . Then receive FEATHERS intervention week 9-16 . There another round outcome measure assessment end week 16 ( assess motor recovery ) . Weeks 17-24 another period intervention follow another round outcome measure assessment ( assess retention ) . Primary Outcome ( functional outcome ) secondary outcome ( participation outcomes ) study follow : i.Primary Outcome : Wolf Motor Function Test WMFT ( test investigator conduct priori power calculation ; expect ~80 % chance detect effect give sample size ) . ii.Secondary Outcomes : 1 . Body Structure/Function : Motricity index ; grip/pinch strength ; NIH stroke scale ; modify rankin test ; reach performance scale . 2 . Activity/Participation : Canadian occupational performance measure ; confidence scale ; paediatric motivation scale , usability system . More detail measure provide `` Outcome Measures '' . F ) Statistical Analysis : Phase 3 : Based previous research , investigator estimate standardized effect size 0.60 0.80 improvement ( Cohen 's ) baseline terminal assessment WMFT . By recruit 20 stroke subject 20 CP subject , expect statistical power ( 1-Î² error probability ) approximately 80 % within-subject change . Our principal statistical test thus within-subject t-test compare pre-intervention WMFT score terminal WMFT test score , combine data early late intervention group . In addition priori comparison , WMFT test score analyze Group ( early versus delay intervention ) Time ( Weeks 0-8 , 9-16 , 17-24 ) mixed-factorial ANOVA . Secondary outcome include motion log file , score game , functional outcome measure , discussion participant exit survey . Secondary outcome function/structure activity/participation analyze use Group Time mixed-factorial ANOVA . Exploratory comparison also undertake . For instance , investigator data analysis allow u compare motor learn young old person hemiplegia effect social medium framework motivation use quantitative qualitative metric ( between-subjects t-tests functional outcome motivation survey ) . The investigator investigate whether statistical correlation subjective measure motivation observe change functional outcome .</detailed_description>
