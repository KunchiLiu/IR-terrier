	<brief_summary>The vitreous fill posterior chamber eye firmly attach , posterior pole , macula optic nerve head ( ONH ) . With formation stepwise posterior vitreous detachment ( PVD ) exert tractional force could influence retinal functioning . Especially patient glaucoma influence vitreous traction ONH could mask progression , interfere current imaging technique even cause ONH hemorrhage . Therefore aim study investigate whether vitreopapillary traction significant effect diagnosis follow glaucoma patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vitreous body fill posterior chamber eye consist mainly water . It keep organize gel like structure numerous collagen fibril make contact surround retina . This interplay know vitreo-retinal interface human eye complex organization bridge molecule anchor vitreous internal limiting membrane . With ageing , vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction accompany progressive weakening adhesion vitreo-retinal interface result stepwise process adhesion release . Since firm attachment posterior pole situate macular papillary region , tractional force exert vitreous separation could influence retinal functioning . Up researcher look primarily influence vitreous traction macular region nerve fiber layer.This research lead insight vitreo-macular traction result macular hole formation , patient condition may benefit vitreolysis induce surgery ( vitrectomy ) intravitreal injection ocriplasmin . More recent report focus influence vitreous morphology optic disc , show VPT alter optic disc architecture , increased average temporal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness associate pronounced visual field defect . This could important sensitive scan diagnostic algorithm develop stag follow glaucoma patient ' optic nerve head , could influence patient ' vitreopapillar interface . As status interface change time , could lead confusion misinterpretation optic disc diagnostic scan . Besides diagnostic challenge induce vitreopapillar interaction , interface may also pathogenetic relevance glaucoma . Indeed , optic disc represent collection ganglion cell axon , glaucoma cause degeneration ganglion cell . Some author already suggest vitreopapillary traction ( VPT ) could play role pathogenesis optic nerve head hemorrhage , regard important risk factor glaucoma progression . Moreover , one could hypothesize VPT cause stress ganglion cell axon therefore contribute directly ganglion cell degeneration . Accordingly , study aim investigate effect VPT ultra-structural level optic disc . A possible structure-function relation investigate help central visual field test focal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness assessment . With increase knowledge image VPT , possibly VPT-staging algorithm develop VPT risk factor define . Finally , project may therapeutic impact , since shed light question whether ( surgically chemically ) induce vitreolysis might beneficial glaucoma patient VPT .</detailed_description>
