	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate effectiveness Cognitive Processing Therapy ( cognitive version ; CPT-C ) deliver use two different format home set treatment combat-related PTSD compare conventional face-to-face CPT-C deliver mental health clinic . The study include two different format in-home therapy : face-to-face in-home CPT-C tele-behavioral health in-home CPT-C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effectiveness Trial In-Home Cognitive Processing Therapy Combat-Related PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study use 3-arm equipoise-stratified randomization design ( Lavori et al. , 2001 ; Shalev et al. , 2011 ) evaluate clinical effectiveness CPT-C deliver three format : Face-to-Face In-Office ( F2F-O ) , Face-to-Face In -Home ( F2F-H ) , Telebehavioral Health In -Home ( TBH-H ) . The equipoise stratify design specifically develop clinical effectiveness trial involve multiple treatment may appropriate research participant . The design allow complete randomization participant interested eligible three treatment arm . It also allow participant opt one treatment arm interest eligible one arm . Without provision large proportion potential participant would exclude study , seriously compromise external validity . Participants elect opt one arm randomize one two remain treatment arm . For example , F2F-O treatment could eliminate severely injured , home-bound , seriously concerned stigma , would randomize receive one home-based CPT-C format . The F2F-H treatment could eliminate participant uncomfortable idea mental health provider come home . The telehealth arm could opt veteran unable use computer , situate private area . The equipoise design use significant confound exist use completely randomize three-arm research design participant randomize arm . With completely randomize design , participant must willing randomized treatment arm else must exclude . All participant willing randomized arm occupy universal donor stratum . The universal donor participant randomize completely randomize design , able participate statistical analysis . Participants elect opt one arm enter stratum comprise remain two arm , assign random one two remain arm . These participant may participate ( along universal donor stratum ) statistical analysis compare arm could randomize . By make choice , participant assigns stratum , consist option find equally acceptable . In design , unable attend clinic randomize one in-home arm . Those able attend clinic give option reject one three treatment . The randomization plan define four stratum ( i.e. , accept randomization three arm reject one three treatment ) . Analyses do pairwise use participant accept randomization two three treatment , include stratum stratum-by-treatment interaction design effect . Note design way include in-clinic arm sample participant unwilling unable randomize in-clinic treatment . Specific Aims . The overall aim project conduct 3-group randomized clinical trial evaluate clinical effectiveness CPT-C deliver three format : ( 1 ) Face-to-Face In-Home CPT-C ; ( 2 ) Face-to-Face In-Office CPT-C ; ( 3 ) Tele-Behavioral Health In-Home CPT-C . Objective 1 : Conduct randomize clinical trial evaluate effectiveness CPT-C deliver three format : ( 1 ) Face-to-Face In-Home CPT-C ( F2F-H ) ; ( 2 ) Face-to-Face In-Office CPT-C ( F2F-O ) ; ( 3 ) Tele-Behavioral Health In-Home CPT-C ( TBH-H ) employ equipoise-stratified randomization . Hypothesis 1 : CPT-C delivered F2F-H format effective treatment PTSD ( symptom reduction diagnostic threshold CAPS-5 ) F2F-O &amp; TBH-H. Hypothesis 2 : CPT-C delivered F2F-H format result great improvement secondary outcome ( depression , alcohol consumption , marital family function ) F2F-O &amp; TBH-H . Objective 2 : Determine standard F2F-O CPT-C enhance deliver special population ( seriously injure , home-based rehab , rural living , severe avoidance ) in-home therapy . Hypothesis 3 : In-home therapy ( F2F-H TBH-H ) result lower perceive stigma seek mental health care higher treatment adherence ( session attendance ; out-of-session assignment completion ; dose therapy ) compare mental health clinic-based therapy . Hypothesis 4 : Participants opt participate in-home therapy ( i.e. , decline F2F-O ) high level treatment satisfaction F2F-O treatment arm .</detailed_description>

The computer must locate private location participant able control access treatment encounter ( ensure privacy confidentiality ) . The computer must accessible enough participant allow frequency require number encounter CPT intervention . The computer must high speed internet access ( e.g. , cable modem , USB , T1/T2 connection ) . If firewall present participant 's computer system , participant need able arrange access control system allow telepresence encounter occur ( i.e. , must either able open port firewall know someone arrange ) . The computer must equip speaker standard headphone jack allow access audio output encounter ( i.e. , able hear therapist talk ) .
