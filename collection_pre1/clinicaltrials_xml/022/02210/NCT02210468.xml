	<brief_summary>The mechanism Osteoarthritis ( OA ) complex , however investigator know cartilage breakdown follow change certain cell cartilage call chondrocytes , lead protease break cartilage . There protein human blood call alpha-2-macroglobulin trap protease prevent breakdown cartilage . Cytonics develop device use patient 's blood remove cell concentrate alpha-2-macroglobulin inject painful knee due osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>
