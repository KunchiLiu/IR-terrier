	<brief_title>Effects Supplement Acute Respiratory Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct randomize , parallel , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 90-day clinical trial January April , 2012 . All staff work Omnilife 's Entrepreneur Support Department ( CREO initial Spanish ) invite participate . This department within Omnilife high incidence acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) report internally company 's medical service ( account 55 % doctor visit within department 2010 ) hence , represent high number individual susceptible ARI . We hold preliminary session department 's entire staff explain procedure ; ask subject interested participate study sign inform consent form fill clinical history . The latter include assessment stress , use Perceived Stress Scale ( high score indicate high level stress ) , physical activity , use International Physical Activity Questionnaire IPAQ ( physical activity categorize three level : light , moderate vigorous ) . In second session week , participant visit company 's medical service measurement weight height ( accordance International Society Advancement Kinanthropometry ISAK standard ) , control laboratory test medical examination rule presence infection . Weight measurement take use Tanita BC553 Ironman Inner Scan Body Fat Scale ( capacity 150 kg , accuracy 0.1 kg ) . Height measurement make use Seca 206 Stadiometer ( accuracy 0.1 cm , measure range 220 cm ) . Both measurement perform two certified standardized anthropometrists . Body mass index ( BMI ) subsequently calculate use variable follow : BMI = weight kg/ ( height ) 2 . The medical examination perform attend physician nurse . It consist assessment vital sign follow procedure describe literature physical examination bodily organs system . Temperature measure use Microlife MT 1931 digital thermometer ( measure range 32 43.9°C , accuracy 0.1°C ) . Heart respiratory rate measure use 3M Littmann Classic II S.E . stethoscope . Blood pressure reading take use 3M Littmann Classic II S.E . stethoscope Aneroid Sphygmomanometer ce0483 ( 18-300 mmHg measurement range , accuracy 2 mmHg ) . Laboratory test conduct support external laboratory ( Instituto Diagnostico Especializado Arboledas , IDEA initial Spanish ) . Included blood test six item ( fast glucose , uric acid , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , cholesterol triglyceride ) analyze spectrophotometric method , complete blood count flow cytometry/microscopy analysis platelet , spectroscopy analysis ass liver function . Subjects laboratory analysis test 12-hour fast . This laboratory obtain quality control certification Quality Assurance Laboratories Program ( PACAL ) Internal Evaluation Quality Program ( PREVECAL ) . In addition , staff certify clinical diagnosis National Association Clinical Chemists ( CONAQUIC ) . Subjects met inclusion criterion randomly assign two group : one receive supplement ( n=30 ) , control group receive placebo , consist mixture maltodextrins , color flavor . Every day two dietitian prepared product , give prepare product two different supervisor turn give product participant consumption . The supervisor record product administration consumption participant control form . Simultaneously , week supervisor provide participant ARI symptom side effect diary fill daily ( indicate whether symptom question present ) . Participants delivered supervisor filled-in diary follow week . Subjects also request self-medicate event feel symptom notify principal researcher attend physician , would make clinical assessment confirm presence absence ARI provide need medical treatment . In case , participant exclude study , treatment provide document . At end supplementation period , initial assessment perform . Subjects also ask perception health time compare felt begin study . Quantitative variable express mean ( SD ) . Qualitative variable express frequency ( % ) . Fisher 's exact test use compare distribution percentage qualitative variable group compare total proportion ill subject across intervention group use intent-to-treat per-population concept . The risk ratio risk difference also calculate episode ARI . To compare average quantitative variable treatment , Mann-Whitney U test use . Statistical analyzes run use SPSS program version 10 Windows Open Epi version 3.01 ; p &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
