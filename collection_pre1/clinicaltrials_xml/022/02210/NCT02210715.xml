	<brief_summary>People infect HIV living longer thanks use antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) . In age HIV person , factor associate early death . One major factor liver disease , due liver infection reason fatty liver . Fatty liver general population serious problem , affect 30 % Canadian population . A specific type fatty liver characterize much inflammation , name nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) lead cirrhosis death . Persons live HIV increase risk NASH toxic effect certain type cART liver , obesity metabolic factor ( example diabetes ) . Some scientific data suggest new cART associate less fatty liver liver damage . However , NASH study detail person live HIV . One reason lack research one way detect liver disease undergo liver biopsy painful complication . Recently , new non-invasive technology ( Fibroscan ) develop tell doctor much liver damage much fat contains without pain complication . Moreover , simple test measure specific protein blood , cytokeratin 18 ( CK-18 ) , help diagnosis NASH . We study effect switch cART new type HIV medication patient non-invasive diagnosis NASH do Fibroscan cytokeratin 18 . We expect switch old cART less hepatotoxic drug lead improvement liver damage , fatty liver NASH diagnose Fibroscan cytokeratin 18 . To evaluate approach plan recruit 58 consent HIV mono infect patient non-invasive diagnosis NASH and/or fatty liver liver damage . Participants undergo Fibroscan , blood test cytokeratin 18 , complete physical examination laboratory test every 3 month 12 month , 18 24 month . The effect switch HIV medication record . We anticipate current study provide evidence reduction inflammation liver damage new cART treatment HIV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current Non-invasive tool liver fibrosis fatty liver/NASH , include Fibroscan/CAP serum cytokeratin 18 ( CK-18 ) , accurate ideal screen monitoring . To date , study use accurate non-invasive tool prospectively evaluate effect switch cART raltegravir HIV mono-infected patient suppress HIV RNA evidence fatty liver and/or significant liver fibrosis order determine whether strategy may slow fibrosis steatosis progression rate . Once candidate screening identify , study detail carefully discuss subject . The subject ask read sign approve informed consent form prior assessment perform . Self-administered questionnaire collect information Alcohol use Disorders Identification Test ( audit C ) , drug use . chart review , ( demographic , medication medical history ) . Blood sample obtain clinical laboratory evaluation ( per standard care ) baseline , follow-up visit , plus serum CK-18 obtain follow-up visit . Routine hematology chemistry evaluation include : complete blood count ( CBC ) differential , CD4 CD8 cell count , viral load , C-reactive Protein , D-dimer , measurement hepatic , pancreatic renal function , fast insulin , creatine kinase , glucose lipid profile . Plasma HIV RNA level measure low limit detection 50 copies/mL . Clinical laboratory evaluation hematology , biochemistry , CD4/CD8 , viral load serology perform chest institute per local practice . Fibroscan perform fasting patient . The probe transducer place skin , rib bone level right lobe liver . An experienced operator ( &gt; 500 examination study ) , perform Fibroscan software calculate median . The standard M probe use patient . The XL probe use obese patient ( BMI &gt; 30 Kg/m2 ) M probe fail provide accurate result . CAP examination perform time diagnose fatty liver . A valid Fibroscan result define 10 validated measure IQR &lt; 30 % median . The following cut-off value apply diagnose fibrosis Fibroscan : 1 ) 8 kilopascal ( kPa ) significant liver fibrosis ; 2 ) 13 kPa cirrhosis . Fatty liver CAP diagnose follow cut-off value : 1 ) 237.8 dB/m mild steatosis ; 2 ) 260 dB/m moderate steatosis ; 3 ) 292.3 dB/m severe steatosis . Subject Identification ( ID ) number assign sequentially subject eligible participate study . The Subject ID Number consist three digit centre number three digit number accord chronological order entry . If patient discontinues study Subject ID Number reuse . The Subject ID Numbers use identification subject source documentation , laboratory sample . This ensure subject data laboratory sample leave study site identify tracked . Randomization study group do use computer-generated random allocation stratification gender . Summary statistic ( mean , median , standard deviation , interquartile range ) obtain clinical demographic data collect baseline study conclusion . The fatty liver liver fibrosis score CAP Fibroscan , respectively , month 24 express function exposure group , adjust baseline value outcome use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model . The average difference change steatosis fibrosis score two group associated hypothesis test obtain ANCOVA model . All analysis base intention-to-treat basis , , patient ' data analyze randomize . To assess sensitivity inference miss data , generate plausible value miss observation use multiple imputation ( MI ) , relatively objective methodology handle miss data longitudinal study . In MI , multiple plausible value generate miss item joint distribution observe data use Bayesian framework , result pool use establish rule simultaneously account uncertainty imputation process . Multivariate logistic regression analysis use explore factor associate non-invasive diagnosis fatty liver/NASH significant liver fibrosis , include patient-related ( age , gender , BMI ) , drug-induced ( time type cART ) , metabolic ( diabetes , insulin resistance , lipid profile , hypertension ) , HIV-related ( HIV viral load , CD4/CD8 ) . Pearson correlation coefficient use measure association CK-18 Fibroscan/CAP value , BMI , transaminases . All hypotheses test conduct 5 % level significance ( 2-sided ) . Analyses perform use R program Windows Release 2.13.1 . The trial monitor safety efficacy Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) compose clinician , statisticians/methodologists lay member appoint McGill University Health center . Adverse event ( AEs ) define untoward medical occurrence subject necessarily causal relationship study medication/intervention . An AE therefore unfavourable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use study drug/intervention , whether related medication/intervention . Stable chronic condition present prior clinical study entry worsen consider adverse event account subject 's medical history . Subjects adverse event follow treated Investigator abnormal parameter symptom resolve stabilize . It clinician determine AE either resolve reach stable state , follow-up necessary . There also source documentation support determination . At contact subject , information regard adverse event elicit appropriate questioning examination , record immediately source document ( e.g. , progress note , laboratory report , survey tool , data collection tool ) . The start date , stop date , severity reportable event , PI 's judgment AE 's relationship study , medication/intervention also record . Any AE occur baseline 30 day follow Week 24 ( time early discontinuation subject study reason ) record source documentation ( patient call ) . Surveillance AEs end 30 day follow Week 24 . If serious adverse event ( SAE ) ongoing time subject discontinues/completes trial SAE follow Investigator agree event satisfactorily resolve follow-up require . Virologic failure must consider patient plasma HIV RNA ≥50 c/mL time follow randomization . For purpose clinical management study , virologic failure define : Two consecutive plasma HIV RNA ≥50 c/mL within four week initial suspect virologic failure . Cases confirm virologic failure trigger genotypic virologic resistance testing , include integrase resistance testing , plasma HIV RNA &gt; 400c/mL . The virologic failure definition intend guidance Investigators use discretion appropriate clinical management patient . Due risk develop integrase resistance set replicate HIV , change antiretroviral therapy subject randomize raltegravir indicate confirm virologic failure . The choice antiretroviral therapy leave discretion treat physician .
