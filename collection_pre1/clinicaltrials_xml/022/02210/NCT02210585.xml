	<brief_summary>The study design test follow hypothesis : Main Objective : To compare level spontaneous physical activity 3 month re-entrainment multi-site electrical stimulation ( m-ES ) , measure actigraphy 7 day , compare conventional care ( lifestyle dietary advice placebo ( simulate ) electrostimulation ) ( control arm ) . Secondary Objectives : To compare metabolic , inflammatory , cardiovascular functional parameter , physical activity , quality life quality sleep , 3 month 2 year two group . Design : We conduct multicenter control study vs. reference care randomization two parallel group double-blind ( placebo electrostimulation ) . Patients ES material available home supervise monthly visit 3 month telephone follow-up two year . The study size calculation base physical activity , percentage lean body mass arterial stiffness measure OBEX study . This project determine whether train strategy effective increase physical activity and/or induce significant metabolic cardiovascular effect patient 2 year . In addition , provide solid base investigation study interaction muscle contraction cardio-metabolic health great precision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity sleep apnea syndrome lead metabolic trouble increase cardiovascular risk . Furthermore , diseases associate reduced exercise tolerance . For many patient morbid obesity , implementation physical activity program remain difficult several reason include level disability psychosocial cause ( scrutiny others , depression poorly adapt equipment ) . Main hypothesis : Neuromuscular electrostimulation way increase spontaneous physical activity ( PA ) treat apneic obese patient low spontaneous physical activity</detailed_description>
