	<brief_summary>This trial initial characterization blu™ product study , purpose gain understanding exposure nicotine crave reduction attain follow use blu™ e-cigarettes adult smoker . Two type exposure utilized : single control administration short-term ad lib use . As smoking behavior vary smoker smoker , control administration allow standardization nicotine `` dose '' study product well understand uptake characteristic well urge reduction achieve controlled condition . Further evaluation ad lib product use condition provide insight product self-administration behavior allow subject achieve acceptable level urge reduction . Comparisons make evaluate difference blu™ formulation well market-leading conventional cigarette , Marlboro Gold King Size ( `` Marlboro cigarette ' ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Nicotine Exposure Urge-to-Smoke Following Use Electronic Conventional Cigarettes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , partially single-blinded , 6-period crossover study 24 subject . The primary objective study : 1. characterize rate extent nicotine exposure follow single control administration ad lib use blu™ e-cigarettes , 2. characterize smoking urge follow single control administration ad lib use blu™ e cigarette . The secondary objective study : 1 . Compare pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile nicotine select blu™ formulation blu™ product Marlboro cigarettes follow single control administration ad lib use study product . 2 . Compare change smoke urge within select blu™ formulation blu™ product Marlboro cigarettes follow single control administration ad lib use study product . 3 . Compare change exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) within select blu™ formulation blu™ product Marlboro cigarette follow use study product . 4 . Assess tolerability study product follow short-term use . Subjects provide blu™ Classic Tobacco Magnificent Menthol product contain 2.4 % nicotine , glycerin vehicle 1 week prior participation study familiarize use product . Subjects confine clinic entire study duration abstain use nicotine containing product period least 36 hour prior product administration . Each product administration include controlled product administration 1 hour ad lib use study product . The controlled product administration consist 50 inhalation assign e-cigarette product ( 5-second inhalation 30-second interval ) smoke one Marlboro cigarette ( 30-second interval subject ' normal inhalation duration ) inhalation monitor clinical staff . The start ad lib product use 30 minute follow start control product use . During ad lib use , subject allow self-administer e-cigarette product desire entire hour responsible maintain inhalation count . During ad lib cigarette product use , subject request product staff desire maintain inhalation count . Pharmacokinetics : Blood sample measurement plasma nicotine concentration take direct venipuncture 10 minute prior , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 minute follow start control product administration . Non-compartmental PK parameter Peak Plasma Concentration Area Plasma Concentration versus time curve calculate plasma nicotine concentration-time data . Pharmacodynamics : Smoking urge assess use 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Assessments occur within 1 minute prior -10 ( pre-product administration ) , 5 , 15 , 25 , 30 , 60 , 90-minute PK blood draw . The following non-compartmental Pharmacodynamic parameter calculate smoke urge change-from-baseline data : Emax0-30 , Emaxreduction0-30 , AUEC0-30 , tEmax0-30 , AUEC30-90 , E90 . Other Measurements : Exhaled CO measurement occur approximately 20 minute prior start control product use approximately 15 minute follow end ad lib product use . Tolerability : Adverse event , physical examination , vital sign , ECGs , laboratory safety test assess evaluate enrolment criterion subject safety study .</detailed_description>
