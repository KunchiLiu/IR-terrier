	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , unblinded , randomize , control , clinical trial 200 subject randomize either Supervised Training Program ( STP ) , Incentivized Weight Loss ( IWL ) Standard Care ( SoC ) . Subjects randomize SoC group ask return regular 3-monthly clinic visit diet exercise recommendations.The STP group offer once-weekly one hour supervise training session charge period six month bcdiabetes.ca fitness center ( locate Vancouver General Hospital Employee Centre gym ) . The IWL group receive financial reward achieve monthly weight loss target . Those fail meet monthly goal receive financial reward . Such financial incentive consider previous research . Due nature intervention , none investigative staff , trainer subject blind randomized assignment . The primary objective study investigate whether behavioral modification intervention form either 6-month supervised training program 6-month financial incentive program , result overall superior clinical outcome comparison standard care . Specifically , improvement glucose control , measure A1c , consider . Given objective nature Primary Outcome , little possibility assessment bias primary clinical outcomes.The secondary objective investigate impact supervise train program incentivized weight loss program weight-loss , LDL ( apoB ) , blood pressure , waist-hip circumference , diabetes-specific quality life measure include behavioral emotional impact ( refer Secondary Outcomes section ) . Patients attend BCDiabetes ( Diabetes Clinic Diamond Center ) approach one diabetes caregiver describe study determine whether interest participating . If patient express interest , provide additional information study consent form free ask question study . They may choose provide consent time leave consent form return late time ask question . A research nurse , coordinator and/or co/principal investigator available answer question patient may . When consent provide , confirmation eligibility criterion complete subject receive randomize group assignment . Eligible subject randomize 2:1:1 fashion SoC , STP IWL group respectively . Randomization stratify age ( ≤ 50 v &gt; 50 year age ) ensure balance age group three treatment arm ; enrollment stratify number participant two age group restrict . Randomization within stratum do permute complete block design random block size ( block small 6 large 15 ) . Randomization complete advance assignment keep individual , separate seal , sequentially label envelope open time randomization individual . Withdrawal Study Intervention : Although encourage continue participation randomize group , subject choose withdraw study , withdraw intervention time . Subjects choose withdraw STP IWL arm continue receive standard care consider cross-overs SoC arm ; subject necessarily withdraw study encourage continue return schedule 3 6 month study visit study outcomes measure . If subject chooses withdraw study entirely , attempt make complete exit visit study outcomes capture . Subjects experience adverse event relate STP arm ( eg : physical injury training ) experience onset worsening sign symptom related medical condition ( eg : shortness breath , dizziness , vomit nausea , etc ) persist day follow supervise train session , experience worsen physical condition ( eg : degenerative disc disorder , knee hip pain , plantar fasciitis , etc ) withdrawn STP intervention . As , subject ask return schedule 3 6 month clinic visit . If point 15 % subject STP arm withdrawn intervention arm due adverse event , worsen medical physical condition , study stop . Study data collect part subject 's electronic medical record bcdiabetes.ca . Identifiable study data house exclusively bcdiabetes.ca ; remove bcdiabetes.ca server , subject identify study registration number different BC CareID number . Remote monitoring EMMES use confidential authenticate automatically schedule direct database query . EMMES Canada also provide oversight quality assurance &amp; monitoring . The primary outcome measure percent subject achieve target A1c . The null research hypothesis support primary objective investigate impact whether behavioral modification intervention form either 6-month supervised training program 6-month incentivized weight loss program , result overall superior clinical outcome comparison standard care : H0 : pSoC ≥ pIWL pSoC ≥ pSTP vs. H1 : pSoC &lt; pIWL pSoC &lt; pSTP pSoC , pSTP pIWL proportion subject achieve target three disease measure . Here , reject null hypothesis implies percent patient achieve target higher either STP arm IWL arm SoC arm . A one-sided , 0.05 alpha-level simultaneous test multiple contrast binomial proportion `` Add-2 '' adjustment use . The primary analysis cohort ITT cohort include randomized subject consider arm originally randomize regardless adherence regimen study protocol . Subjects cross-over intervention prior Month 3 ( ie : complete le 3 required 6 month ) consider failure arm originally randomize . Clinical data last , exit visit use construct primary outcome subject withdraw study , intervention , subsequent Month 3 . To corroborate primary , unadjusted analysis , logistic regression model fit baseline clinical demographic data well measure compliance intervention adjust possible imbalance important variable . Also , primary analysis repeat per-protocol cohort subject complete study accord protocol cross-over withdraw therapy . Graphical technique summary statistic two randomize group baseline month 3 6 also present . Summary statistic graphical presentation use summarize data secondary outcome . All hypothesis test 2-sided 5 % Type I error probability . There adjustment multiple comparison among secondary outcome exception multiple domain within single psychosocial instrument ( eg : emotional burden , physician-related distress , regimen-related distress , diabetes-related interpersonal distress domain within DDS ) subject Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison adjustment . Analyses conduct ITT cohort corroborate analysis per-protocol cohort . Each clinical outcome measure capture continuous dichotomize variable ( eg : A1c absolute level &lt; 7.0 % ) . Dichotomized variable analyze described Primary Analysis . Continuous variable analyze three way . First , summary statistic graphical presentation result perform baseline month 3 6 . Second , change baseline month 6 compare use paired t-test , Mann-Whitney test distributional assumption hold . A subject 's last available , exit visit , use month 6 visit available . Third , longitudinal random-effects model use model trajectory outcome time determine influence randomize intervention group trajectory . Variables may transform satisfy assumption normally distribute random effect , result present original scale . Sample Size Justification : The primary null hypothesis compare probability patient control either experimental group Standard Care group : H0 : pSoC ≥ pIWL pSoC ≥ pSTP vs. H1 : pSoC &lt; pIWL pSoC &lt; pSTP Based data observe within clinic case recruit , success rate Standard Care patient estimate 75 % . A sample size 200 subject 2:1:1 randomization SoC , STP IWL group respectively provide power 95 % reject null hypothesis true difference SoC either experimental arm 25 % great ( eg : 37.5 % compare 62.5 % ) . In addition , sample size provide power 74 % reject null hypothesis favor alternative hypothesis percent patient achieve control great among STP IWL among SoC , true difference arm 25 % great .</detailed_description>
