	<brief_summary>Graves ' disease ( MIM 27500 ) lead cause hyperthyroidism worldwide . The prevalence Graves ' disease quite high ( 2.7 % woman ) , solid evidence genetic predisposition . Despite clinical scientific significance , Graves ' disease still mysterious term susceptibility gene pathophysiological mechanism . The immune repertoire , sum T B lymphocytes body give time , snapshot historical record person 's immune function . Thanks power next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) , massively parallel sequence B cell T cell receptor suddenly become plausible , open door many creative approach study immune relate disease . The ultimate goal project use NGS deep sequence immune repertoire experiment perform Graves ' disease sub-group genetic fine mapping , identify Graves ' disease-specific T cell B cell receptor . Furthermore , use immune repertoire approach , investigator want study critical epitope thyroid auto-antigens , delineate pathophysiological step various disease stage various sub-groups . Investigators expect solve immune repertoire Graves ' disease different sub-group presentation various disease activity stage .</brief_summary>
