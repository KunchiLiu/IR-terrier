	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect walnut-derived ALA bioactives multiple CVD risk factor , include central blood pressure , arterial stiffness index , inflammatory marker , urinary isoprostanes , vascular adhesion marker , change lipids lipoprotein . Gut microbiome change due walnut consumption also assess use 16S rRNA gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Walnuts Central Blood Pressure , Arterial Stiffness Indices , Lipoproteins , Other CVD Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diets contain nut likely reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk mechanism remain poorly define . Walnuts contain substantial amount polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) , particularly alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , rich source bioactives . Many vegetable oil high PUFAs lack ALA provide complement bioactive compound walnut . ALA think improve cardiovascular health modulate circulate lipid concentration , alter membrane structure/function enhance total ω-3 fatty acid content cell membrane phospholipid , reduce inflammatory reaction inhibit production arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids . Consumption walnuts consistently show improve blood lipids/lipoproteins vascular health . However , remain much debate preferable replacement saturate fat diet . Because ALA bioactives provide , walnut may confer specific CVD benefit . To study effect walnut , term ALA content bioactive compound , compare two test diet ( one containing walnuts one match PUFA ALA content devoid walnuts bioactives ) control diet match macronutrient linoleic acid ( LA ) content provide oleic acid place ALA . This diet design provide information walnut affect select endpoint interest due bioactives well ALA content , whether walnut ALA superior substitute dietary saturate fat compare oleic acid . Feeding protocol study treatment : This study design double-blind , 3-period , randomize , cross-over control feeding study . Prior randomization , participant complete two week run-in standard Western diet . Each diet period treatment phase 6 week duration , separate 2-week washout period . The three test diet : 1 ) walnut diet ( WD ; provide ~2.0 oz walnut per day ) ; 2 ) match walnut control diet ( WCD ) provide fatty acid profile walnut diet , contain walnut ( bioactives ) ; 3 ) low ALA diet ( LAD ) similar macronutrient ( linoleic acid ) composition WD WCD , use oleic acid replace ALA. Study diet prepare metabolic kitchen , three isocaloric meal snack provide day , base 7-day rotate menu cycle . Participants instructed consume prepare food limit intake alcohol 2 drinks/week caffeinated calorie-free beverage 40 ounce ( 5 drink ) per day . Diets plan every subject accord his/her energy requirement nutritionally adequate . This diet design permit WD compare WCD LAD , thereby , allow u ascertain specific effect walnuts bioactive component ( include beyond ALA ) may CVD risk factor artery health .</detailed_description>
