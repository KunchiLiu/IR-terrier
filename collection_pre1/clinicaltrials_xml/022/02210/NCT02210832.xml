	<brief_summary>Investigators examine whether add financial incentive current best practice smoke cessation pregnancy ( i.e. , referral pregnancy-specific counseling use telephone quit line ) increase cessation rate improve infant health . While expensive upfront compare best practice alone , investigator hypothesize treatment approach economically justify later cost saving associate woman quit , healthy baby , need less healthcare .

	<brief_title>Financial Incentives Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking pregnancy lead preventable cause poor pregnancy outcome U.S . Most pregnant smoker continue smoke pregnancy produce serious immediate longer-term adverse health consequence infant . Smoking pregnancy highly associated economic disadvantage substantive contributor health disparity . Efficacious intervention available , cessation rate low ( &lt; 20 % ) improvement birth outcome often modest absent . Current treatment usually entail relatively brief , lower-cost intervention ( e.g. , pregnancy specific quit line ) . There broad consensus effective intervention sorely need . This team investigator develop novel behavioral economic intervention woman earn financial incentive contingent smoking abstinence . In metaanalysis treatment smoke pregnancy , effect size achieve financial incentive several fold large achieve low intensity approach medication . The intervention also appear improve birth outcome increase breastfeed duration . While highly promising , research need least three area . ( 1 ) The evidence birth outcome breastfeed study combine data across trial rather single prospective trial , ( 2 ) whether intervention produce postpartum improvement health investigate , ( 3 ) overall cost-effectiveness approach examine . To examine unanswered question , investigator propose randomize , control clinical trial compare efficacy cost effectiveness one year postpartum current best practice smoke cessation pregnancy vs. best practice plus financial incentive among 230 pregnant , Medicaid recipients . A third condition 115 pregnant nonsmoker match smoker sociodemographic health condition include well compare extent treatment reduce burden smoking estimate much might accomplish improvement incentives intervention without exceed cost-effectiveness . The investigator hypothesize best practice plus financial incentive effective usual care practice alone , incentive intervention cost effective , add incentive reduces great proportion health economic burden smoking best practice alone , do remain cost effective . Overall , propose study potential substantially advance knowledge cost-effective smoking cessation pregnant woman . Importantly , strong association smoking pregnancy economic disadvantage , propose study also potential contribute new knowledge relevant reduce serious challenge health disparity .</detailed_description>
