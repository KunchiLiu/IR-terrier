	<brief_summary>Limiting surgical stress manage postoperative pain well understood influence recovery outcome major surgery colorectal cancer fundamental aspect enhance recovery protocol . Traditional approach deal problem epidural patient control intravenous opioid analgesia associate problem may detrimental postoperative recovery surgical outcome . As result evidence literature increase interest alternative technique intrathecal anaesthesia continuous wound infusion local anaesthetic , however nobody examined effect combine technique impact surgical stress response . We intend compare patient undergo major resection colorectal cancer receive intrathecal anaesthesia combination wound infusion local anaesthetic receive continuous wound infusion alone . We examine surgical stress response postoperative pain control addition objective measure postoperative recovery . We suggest approach attenuate surgical stress response provide optimal pain control ultimately translate improved recovery outcome follow surgery colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot randomise control trial Hypotheses - Following colorectal surgery , spinal anaesthesia combine continuous infusion local anaesthetic surgical wound provide 1. good pain relief 2. reduce stress response compare use continuous infusion local anaesthetic surgical wound alone . Patients undergo surgical resection colorectal cancer randomise receive either 1 . A single shot spinal anaesthesia plus continuous infusion local anaesthetic surgical wind 2 . Continuous infusion local anaesthetic surgical wind Spinal Anaesthesia The spinal anaesthetic ( SA ) place commencement general anaesthesia ensure patient remain blinded intervention . SA perform lateral position use midline approach . L3/4 interspace identify use Tuffier 's anatomical landmark . After confirmation correct placement use 25G Whitacre needle , 12.5 mg hyperbaric Bupivacaine mixture 500mcg Diamorphine inject intrathecally . Infusion local anaesthetic The catheter infusion local anaesthetic give , place surgeon end procedure location determine surgical approach . A bolus dose 20ml 0.25 % L-Bupivacaine injected catheter prior connection elastomeric pump also contain 270ml 0.25 % L-Bupivacaine General anaesthesia manage way group</detailed_description>
