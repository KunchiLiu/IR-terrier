During Week 1 , blood urine also use pregnancy test become pregnant . All patient follow test procedure : During Week 8 : - You physical exam . - Your blood oxygen level test . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) collect immune system test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . You surgery Week 10 . During surgery , tumor tissue collect immune system test . You sign separate consent explain surgery risk . If screen tell eligible surgery Week 10 , biopsy last dose study drug . After Surgery ( Week 14 , 15 , 16 ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) collect immune system test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . Every 12 week start Week 26 , 27 , 28 , CT MRI scan check status disease . The schedule test procedure may change doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug ( ) 2 year surgery . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit After stop receiving treatment : - You physical exam . - Your blood oxygen level test . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - If screen tell eligible surgery Week 10 , biopsy last dose study drug . Follow-up Visits : About 30 day stop treatment around 100 day : - You physical exam . - Your blood oxygen level test . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Every 3 month first 2 year surgery , every 6 month third year , every year unless disease get worse intolerable side effect occur : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA approve treat metastatic melanoma non-small cell lung cancer disease gotten bad receive platinum-based chemotherapy . Ipilimumab FDA approve treat metastatic melanoma . The use nivolumab ipilimumab study investigational . Bevacizumab approve certain type kidney cancer several type cancer , include breast , colon , lung cancer . It FDA approve treatment metastatic kidney cancer . The use bevacizumab study investigational . The study doctor explain study drug ( ) design work . Up 105 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
