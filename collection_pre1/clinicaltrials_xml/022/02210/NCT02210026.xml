	<brief_summary>The investigator propose test hypothesis Seattle bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( Seattle-PAP ) support respiratory physiology low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants effectively standard bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seattle-PAP Bubble Nasal CPAP Work Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary outcome variable work breathing ( WOB ) two hour period , estimate pressure-rate product , assess 6 Fr ( 2 mm ) catheter place distal esophagus monitoring esophageal pressure ( Pes ) , thereby estimate change pleural pressure breath cycle . The following endpoint would also assess : Oxygen saturation Fraction Inspired Oxygen ( FiO2 ) need keep saturation acceptable range , Heart Rates ( HR ) , transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( TcPCO2 ) , respiratory rate throughout 6 hour study period . Objective determination infant require less respiratory support difficult , measurement pressure-rate product estimate work breathing , use esophageal catheter , estimate infant 's respiratory effort . However , objective , simple-to-use , low cost , non-invasive method tool determine infant 's respiratory effort exist currently . This study also design test hypothesis infant ' chest abdominal movement assess quantitatively video image way correlate intrathoracic pressure , measure esophageal catheter .</detailed_description>
