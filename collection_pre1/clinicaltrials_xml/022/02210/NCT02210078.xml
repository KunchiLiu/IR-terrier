	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety give cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) patient stem cell transplant . Researchers also want learn cell help control CMV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Third-Party Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes ( CTLs ) Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CTLs : CTLs make MD Anderson healthy donor blood cell . The healthy donor donate blood stem cell stem cell transplant patient . The cell donor least partially match donor . All donor screen way routine blood donor . CTL Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive CTLs vein . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . You remain clinic least 1 hour CTL infusion check . Your oxygen level measure pulse oximetry . For test , clothespin-shaped clip place finger least 30 minute . If infection partially respond , get bad , stay , respond CTLs , may receive another infusion CTLs least 2 week first infusion . Study Visits : Within 72 hour infusion : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On day infusion , 1 week , 2 week , 3 month , 6 month infusion , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check status virus , check immune system , see well transplant take . If blood drawn reason timepoints , extra blood drawn use test . In case , another needlestick day . At 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week 3 , 6 , 12 month infusion : - You physical exam . During physical exam , check possible reaction study drug , include graft versus host disease ( GVHD -- transplant donor tissue attack tissue recipient 's body ) Months 3 , 6 , 12 infusion . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , part blood use check status virus . During Week 4 visit , part blood sample use check HAMA immune system reaction . At Months 2 , 4 , 5 , 7-11 infusion , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check status virus doctor think need . At Month 9 infusion , check GVHD . If 2 CTL infusion , study visit restart last infusion . Starting Week 1 , blood drawn study local lab clinic closer home . The result send study doctor MD Anderson . Length Study : Your participation study end last follow-up visit 12 month last infusion . You take study early unable receive first CTL infusion , doctor think best interest , disease get bad come back , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . The use CTLs treat infection FDA approve commercially available . CTLs currently use research purpose . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients type autologous allogeneic HSCT CMV infection include . 2 . Persistent CMV infection despite optimum antiviral therapy . . Patients CMV disease : define demonstration CMV biopsy specimen visceral site ( culture histology ) detection CMV culture direct fluorescent antibody stain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid presence new change pulmonary infiltrates OR b . Failure antiviral therapy : define continue presence DNAemia ( define &gt; /=137 copies/ml PCR ) least 2 week CMV antiviral therapy OR 1 ) Optimum therapy define least 14 day therapy Ganciclovir , Foscarnet , Cidofovir , Valganciclovir patient disease CMV viremia . 2 ) Relapse CMV antiviral therapy define recurrence DNAemia least 2 week antiviral therapy ; OR c. Patients tolerate standard antiviral therapy continue antiviral treatment due side effect profile eligible independent antiviral therapy duration . 3 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative autologous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use marrow , peripheral blood stem cell single double umbilical cord blood . 4 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid equal less 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone . 5 . Patients chronic GVHD prednisone equal le 0.5 mg/kg receive secondline GVHD treatment like Pentostatin , Infliximab , Etanercept , etc . 6 . Written inform consent and/or sign assent line patient , parent guardian . 7 . Negative pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential . 8 . All age . 1 . Patients receive prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day time enrollment , receive ATG , donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Campath within 28 day enrollment . 2 . Patients uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . Patients ongoing viral infection exclude . 3 . Patients active acute GVHD grade IIIV . 4 . Active uncontrolled relapse malignancy .</criteria>
