	<brief_title>CENTER-TBI : Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>â€¢ Introduction : CENTER-TBI ( Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research TBI ) ( www.center-tbi.eu ) project embed within International Initiative TBI Research ( InTBIR ) ( http : //intbir.nih.gov/ ) , collaboration European Commission ( EC ) , US National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NIH-NINDS ) Canadian Institute Health Research ( CIHR ) . - Research aim : The basic concept project exploit exist heterogeneity biology , care outcome TBI patient discover underlie pathophysiology , refine characterisation , identify effective clinical intervention . The key driver research plan collect data large number European centre sufficiently large cohort enable 'Comparative effectiveness research ' ( CER ) analyse difference clinical care management pathways TBI . Improved disease characterization aid Precision Medicine , concept recently enunciate US National Academy Science . Such improved characterization stratification allow targeted therapy . Further , CER provide promising framework identify best practice improve outcome TBI . CER generation synthesis evidence compare benefit harm alternative method prevent , diagnose , treat , monitor clinical condition improve delivery care . The purpose CER assist consumer , clinician , purchaser , policy maker make inform decision improve health care individual population level . - Cohort : A large core cohort patient across severity spectrum TBI recruit approximately 77 site Europe Israel ( CENTER-TBI Core Study ) : 5400 patient differentiate 3 equal stratum approximately 1800 : - ER stratum : patient see discharged ER ; - Admission stratum : patient admit hospital ICU ; - ICU stratum : patient admit directly ICU . Balance number strata aim , sit allow arrange recruitment strategy best suit local requirement . The core cohort underpin comparison large registry ( CENTER-TBI registry ) base pragmatic data collection patient TBI see participate centre ( establish internal generalizability study ) , comparison national trauma registry ( establish external generalizability finding ) . In core cohort , detail data collect clinical parameter , neuroimaging study , biomarker analysis , DNA analyse , longitudinal outcome assessment . In selected centre , extend study additionally focus advanced magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , detailed coagulation profile high resolution ICU monitoring . - Sample size assessment : The sample size estimate ( n=5400 ) base : - Practical logistic consideration - Power calculation different stratum , target comparative effectiveness analysis , assume between-centre between-country heterogeneity identify previous research ( express variance parameter random effect model , Tau^2 0.431 ) - Postulated odds ratio intervention effect approximately 5 % improvement outcome . Overall , calculation provide statistical power detect odds ratio ~1.2 associate difference process intervention variable across core dataset power 80 % ; require somewhat large odds ratio three individual stratum . In registry expect able detect difference ( predominantly organizational system variable ) odds ratio 1.2 power 82 % . - Quality control assurance : Continuous monitoring enrolment completeness data perform ICON contract research organization ( CRO ) . Source data verification ( SDV ) perform 10 % subject CRO . The quality data collection enhance implement automate data entry check impossible/implausible value implement data check consistency variable . A task force study personnel evaluate completeness , consistency validity submit data function support desk participate site . - Data management : Prior upload study database , acquire data store locally . All patient allocate random Global Unique Personal Identification number ( GUPI ) link locally hospital identifier . All uploaded data de-identified image deface prior upload . While blood sample clinical data link , set data keep confidential anonymised beyond initial stage correlation analysis . All image electronic data keep individually password protect server . All clinical data enter electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ) manage 'QuesGen data management platform ' ( http : //www.quesgen.com/ ) develop collaboration Karolinska Institutet International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Faculty ( KI-INCF ) . As data enter form , system run data validation check include conditionally require data , validation across field , validation requirement base subject type . If validation check fail , user alert immediately data meet Quality Assurance ( QA ) criterion issue address correct point . All de-identified electronic study data CENTER-TBI database store securely European data space supervision KI-INCF duration subject enrolment follow-up period afterwards data analysis preparation publication . We estimate analysis publication period last several year conclusion subject enrolment . Together QuesGen Systems , KI-INCF ensure data standard establish data model e.g . conformity field format , field code names ensure consistency across datasets . Any approved change fully document dataset update maintain data quality accuracy . KI-INCF responsible importing clean datasets analytic platform determine coordinator . Where applicable , information relevant patient 's care make available physician responsible . Data , include blood sample collect part study share anonymised form collaborator European state ( part European Commission Framework7 fund program ) , select collaborator country form part emerge International Traumatic Brain Injury Research initiative . - Computing platform Neuroinformatics Resource : The KI-INCF coordinate establishment informatics platform acquisition , storage analysis CDE-based clinical data . The goal develop next generation open standards-based platform support advance large-scale analytics model build . Such platform also provide model future clinical study brain diseases disorder . This development receive additional support One Mind Research . - Statistical analysis plan : Statistical analysis Comparative Effectiveness Research ( CER ) question primarily apply random effect model , center include high level , patient consider cluster within center . In analysis , high level cluster also consider , e.g . country , European region ; low level , e.g . physician within hospital . Confounding factor measure individual patient and/or center level , consider extensively , target specific research question . Statistical analysis good characterization TBI exploratory , aim well understand complexity disease discover new association . In addition standard statistical descriptive inferential technique , also employ novel machine learn technique appropriate . Prognostic analysis consider range variable , include genetic , demographic clinical data , physiological signal , image result , biomarkers predictor early endpoint physiologic derangement ( e.g . raise ICP ) , late outcome , include mortality , functional outcome , quality life neuropsychological performance . Previously newly develop prediction model validate comparison observe predicted outcome risk , predictive performance summarize measure model fit , discrimination , calibration . - Missing data : Every effort make limit number miss data CENTER-TBI study . Missing value , however , inherent clinical study . Missing value may confound descriptive , prognostic CER analysis . Thus , appropriate technique deal miss value require . First , evaluate various reason missingness per centre . Next , explore use alternative statistical approach , include inverse probability weight multiple imputation . We consider miss value baseline characteristic well short long term outcome . Based simulation study practical consideration develop standard operating procedure towards analysis miss value , respect difference multiple research question . - Informed Consent : Informed consent procedure follow local national requirement case . We anticipate many potential patient able consent participate project . The nature TBI mean patient may lack capacity decide participate study especially early time point . It important try include patient ensure representative sample patient include avoid bias study finding . Every step take ensure test capacity undertaken decision person 's capacity consent consent participation research take . If subject capable self-consent , effort make locate legally acceptable representative act behalf subject . When legally acceptable representative ( e.g . consultee/proxy ) identify , opinion seek potential participant 's wish feeling relation project , whether would want take part study . Subjects free withdraw , withdrawn consultee/proxy appropriate , point study , need state reason . - Impact : The CENTER-TBI project contribute towards overall goal InTBIR , identify effective efficient treatment provision , thus improve outcome reduce cost . The science project provide novel information disease process , treatment , outcome , prognosis TBI , identify new therapeutic target therapy ; CENTER-TBI repository ensure opportunity legacy research . Thus , project potential improve current health care delivery population individual level , deliver early scientific advance could improve care patient TBI , provide rich investment future biomedical research .</detailed_description>
