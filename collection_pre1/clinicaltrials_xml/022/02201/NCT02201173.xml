	<brief_summary>People spinal cord injury ( SCI ) suffer secondary health condition result undue physical challenge impact participation activity everyday life . Locomotor Training ( LT ) show demonstrate improvement balance walk function animal human reactivate spinal circuit intensive therapy muscle level injury . However , know LT also beneficial health effect focus study propose undertaken Stony Brook University ( SBU ) lead site . LT think produce activation spinal network help recover balance walk SCI may correspond improvement health measure bladder function , breathe capacity , cholesterol cardiac risk factor marker , ability stand upright without drop blood pressure result sensation dizziness . LT take place treadmill body weight supported harness , walk overground practice key exercise home community . The emphasis load body leg without brace device except necessary function home . The overall objective study capture analyze health outcome data collect 80 patient enrol 7 NeuroRecovery Network ( NRN ) clinic USA receive LT . The NRN fund Christopher Dana Reeve Foundation CDC implement LT people SCI . The purpose application leverage NRN funding , provide support LT standardize outcome measure , generate knowledge health outcome LT individual SCI . The propose project accomplish utilization staff 6 NRN site , lead study principal investigator lead clinical research coordinator SBU . They ensure data capture LT standardized manner , correct time enter de-identified database . The study hypotheses LT , compare , patient SCI improve lipid profile insulin factor measure fast blood test ; respiratory function measure specialized easy use breathe equipment ; blood pressure heart rate maneuver test responses abrupt change posture . The relevance proposal help determine association intensive activity- base intervention ( LT ) improvements health use form basis large randomize clinical trial clinical practice guideline .</brief_summary>
