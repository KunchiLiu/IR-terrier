	<brief_title>The Role Circulating Soluble CD74 Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) devastate cause morbidity mortality characterize alveolar epithelial endothelial injury . Despite recent advance pathogenetic mechanism therapy strategy ALI , effort identify circulate factor predict severity ALI/ARDS patient unrevealing . CD74 ( also know major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II invariant chain ) type II transmembrane protein , recently find high-affinity receptor macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) . MIF promote neutrophil accumulation alveolar space via bind CD74 express cell surface . Our previous study， consistent others , show MIF highly express acute lung injury ( ALI ) . In addition , also detect highly CD74 expression lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced ALI mouse model . Recently , circulate form CD74 discover autoimmune liver disease . Similarly , investigate existence soluble form CD74 serum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) ALI mouse model burn trauma relate ALI patient . Based find , postulate soluble CD74 might participate regulate lung inflammation potential novel ALI/ARDS biomarker .</detailed_description>
