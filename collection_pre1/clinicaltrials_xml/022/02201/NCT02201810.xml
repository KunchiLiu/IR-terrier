	<detailed_description>In investigator ' previous QL protocol , FWH20080093H , investigator document military-tailored QL associate high rate sustain smoke cessation . The proactive QL produce superior cessation rate one year follow-up compare reactive QL . Unfortunately , even high rate cessation , large number participant ( majority participant ) fail remain quit follow-up . Civilian QLs observe marked decay sustain cessation rate end treatment one year follow-up . An opportunity exist reengage smoker relapse fail quit end QL treatment . Civilian QLs use one two treatment , Recycling ( repeat smoke cessation counsel ) Rate Reduction ( cut time ) , primary method treatment reengagement . Unfortunately , method reengaging relapsed/failed quit smoker systematically evaluate . As , propose randomize participant relapse fail quit end intervention either ( 1 ) repeat proactive QL ( Recycle ) ; ( 2 ) smoking reduction goal eventual cessation ( Rate Reduction ) ; ( 3 ) choice Recycle Rate Reduction ( Choice ) . Efficacy establish assess point prevalence continuous abstinence 12 month follow-up . All participant ( approximately 1900 ) consent follow-up treatment reengagement since know priori quit quit/relapse . The investigator anticipate , base investigator ' QL study 30 % quit remain quit base eight-week proactive QL 70 % either quit relapse ( nâ‰ˆ1300 ) . Those smoke three-month follow-up stratify ( base whether quit relapse vs. quit Proactive QL base upon self-report ) randomize three treatment reengagement strategy ( Recycle , Rate Reduction , Choice ) , one last 8 week . Then , one year follow-up , investigator assess point prevalence continuous abstinence . Since intervene initially fail quit relapse , continuous abstinence define point last treatment reengagement intervention ( one year point ) .</detailed_description>
