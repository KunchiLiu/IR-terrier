	<brief_title>Cyclic Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Maintenance Therapy Pediatric Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enteral nutrition ( EN ) highly efficacious treatment option Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . In child , exclusive EN consider first choice therapy induce remission pediatric CD , highlight recent ESPGHAN-ECCO guideline . Several meta-analyses show anti-inflammatory potential EEN comparable effect steroid . In addition , child CD often mark growth retardation EEN one efficacious treatment option induce catch-up growth patient . There convince data indicate EN highly efficacious give exclusive basis , use partial EN markedly less effective induce remission active Crohn 's disease compare exclusive EN . Recently , suggest exclusive EN dominant effect intestinal microbiota , contribute induction remission . There exist several strategy maintain remission child CD , clear consensus maintenance treatment follow . There indicator believe enteral nutritional therapy might play also significant role maintenance therapy CD . Given fact many center use top-down approach introduction immunosuppressor and/or biologics at/or shortly diagnosis , investigator want test possibility treatment option efficiently maintain remission le ( ) side effect base enteral nutrition avoid early use immunosuppressor . It 's French multicenter , prospective , randomize study PROBE ( prospective randomize open blind end-point ) evaluation . Randomization perform blind centralized manner , allocate patient one two treatment group : - ARM A : Cyclic exclusive MODULEN IBD 2 week every 8 week - ARM B : MODULEN IBD supplementation ( 25 % caloric requirement ) alone A Physician involved study design blind treatment arm perform evaluation patient study visit . A total four visit ( include final visit ) schedule trial period 12 month rhythm every three month ( +/- 2 week ) patient . The study visit happen schedule routine visit , necessary routine care CD patient . Each visit comprise routine clinical evaluation . The assessment maintenance remission particularly important ( wPCDAI &lt; 12.5 point ) , routine lab analysis include fecal calprotectin require visit . In addition , relevant medical event record . Only patient participate annex study additional stool sample ( microbial analysis ) require . At M9 visit , follow-up endoscopy ( M12+/- 6weeks ) entero-MRI ( M12+/- 6 week ) program part routine surveillance patient maintenance therapy , allow adjust treatment follow necessary . Compliance treatment monitor recording daily MODULEN IBD intake 2 week period E-system . A quality life E-questionnaire fill one day prior visit .</detailed_description>
