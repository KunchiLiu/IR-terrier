	<brief_summary>Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) well-established treatment patient metastatic brain tumor . Although SRS high tumor growth control intervention associate adverse radiation effect ( ARE ) approximately 15 % patient . The traditional approach , still mainstay , administration course high dose anti-inflammatory corticosteroid . Currently effective oral neuroprotective agent clinical practice improve outcome patient ARE radiosurgery brain metastasis . Minocycline , antibiotic favorable adverse effect profile pharmacokinetics , show neuroprotective property experimental model variety neurological disease , well human clinical trial . The investigator propose single arm clinical trial , evaluate safety feasibility minocycline improve ARE . This study recruit 15 patient treated minocycline ( 100mg BID ) 3 month . This clinical trial potential prove minocycline therapy safe patient population . In addition , positive result provide preliminary evidence use array radiosurgical indication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) proven highly effective management brain metastasis , without risk . Despite selective target lesion sharp dose fall-off associate radiosurgical treatment , adverse radiation effect ( AREs ) occur 10-15 % patient . Adverse radiation effect ( AREs ) define unexpected undesirable post-radiosurgery imaging change regardless whether clinically symptomatic . Patients show ARE limited therapeutic option corticosteroid main treatment modality . This single arm clinical trial , evaluate safety feasibility minocycline improve AREs . Brain metastases patient documented AREs treat minocycline ( 100 mg twice day ) 3 month addition standard treatment oral corticosteroid . The investigator anticipate recruit total 15 patient 12 month . Primary aim : The primary aim study evaluate safety feasibility minocycline therapy patient ARE radiosurgery . The investigator ' hypothesis minocycline safe patient population . Safety assess monitor blood level drug , liver enzyme , renal function test , monitor major minor side-effects . Research Strategy The investigator plan conduct single arm observational study evaluate safety feasibility minocycline patient diagnose radiosurgery associate adverse radiation effect . In addition clinical biochemical monitoring safety , investigator also employ neuroimaging technique investigate whether minocycline reduces enhancement lesion post contrast T1 weight MRI reduces hyper intensity surround tumor detect T2 MRI radiosurgery . Primary Outcomes : 1 ) The primary clinical outcome safety minocycline use patient population . Secondary outcome : 1 ) The investigator also review brain image detail find evidence benefit Minocycline therapy reduction resolution volume T2 hyper intensity contrast enhancement lesion ( radiation necrosis ) 4-6 week 3 month follow-up . 2 ) Overall neurological status 3 ) Change neurocognitive status , 4 ) Reduction number patient need resection 5 ) Changes plasma biomarkers , plasma drug level . Target Population : Recruitment take place Center Image-guided Neurosurgery UPMC . All patient AREs brain metastasis radiosurgery potentially eligible study . The investigator anticipate enrol 15 patient . Patients diagnose base MRI finding . The investigator evaluate T1 pre post contrast , T2 , FLAIR Perfusion MR order diagnose ARE . MR spectroscopy CT Pet obtain clinically indicate . The investigator use T1/T2 match proportion edema versus lesion volume guide diagnose ARE .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age range : 18 90 year Males female . Patients must undergo cranial radiosurgery . MRI evidence support diagnosis ARE and/or surgical biopsy evidence necrosis without tumor ≤2 month study entry . Karnofsky performance status ≥60 , With without evidence progressive neurologic sign symptom appropriate location ARE , previous bevacizumab therapy . With without previous chemotherapy tumor . Routine laboratory study result bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal , aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal , creatinine &lt; 2.0 time upper limit normal . Patients history seizure require receive anticonvulsant therapy seizurefree ≥1 week study . Significant mass effect require resection ( assessed clinical neurosurgeon ) Known hypersensitivity tetracycline Women childbearing age must nonlactating negative urine pregnancy test ( adequate birth control include use intra uterine device , barrier method , e.g . condom , diaphragm ) . The result animal study indicate tetracycline cross placenta find fetal tissue , potentially toxic effect develop fetus ( often relate retardation skeletal development ) . Evidence embryo toxicity note animal treat early pregnancy . Therefore pregnant woman allow participate study Female subject oral contraceptive Contraindication undergo MRI Significant cardiopulmonary , renal neurological comorbidities Current diagnosis major depression , substance abuse , psychiatric disorder ;</criteria>
