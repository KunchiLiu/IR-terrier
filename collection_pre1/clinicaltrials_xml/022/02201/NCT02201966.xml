	<brief_summary>Low back pain common condition child perform gymnastics . Commonly , injury result specific injury , stress injury lumbar spine . Regional interdependence theory suggest adjacent joint muscle work properly increase stress place particular joint . This theory would suggest patient enough hip extension perform back bend increase motion would occur lumbar spine allow gymnast complete technique . Currently , research link impairments joint low back pain gymnast . This cross sectional study assess relationship gymnast back pain flexibility strength shoulder hip joint . Investigators travel local gymnastics train center assess gymnast ' strength flexibility hips shoulder . The gymnast also fill questionnaire assess back pain past month much limit ability participate gymnastics . Investigators blind result survey . The goal research study see link strength flexibility hip , shoulder gymnast low back pain . The investigator hypothesize gymnast demonstrate impairment strength flexibility hip , shoulder likely complaint low back pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Interdependence Shoulders Hips Gymnasts With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female gymnast fill survey prior strength flexibility test . The investigator blind result survey . The questionaire ask gymnast several question : 1 . Age 2 . Years Gymnastics 3 . At level last compete ? 4 . On average many hour per week participate gymnastics ? 5 . Have back pain past month affect ability participate gymnastics ? 6 . If answer yes last question : please rate ability participate gymnastics back pain ? ( 0 represent unable perform gymnastics 100 represent difficulty participate gymnastics After gymnast complete survey investigator assess flexibility strength shoulder hip muscle . Investigators blind survey result . Evaluation measure perform randomized manner . Subjects randomly perform shoulder hip test first ( determine flip coin ) . Flexibility strength test also determine randomly ( determine flip coin ) . Evaluation measure Shoulder Flexibility Passive Motion test : - Prior shoulder flexibility testing , gymnast 's arm length measure tip acromion process ½ inch wooden dowel grasp hand hold shoulder flex 90 degree . - For test , gymnast lie prone firm floor chin nose touching floor . - Both arm hold parallel body shoulder flex 180 degree . - The gymnast grasp ½ inch dowel overhand grip tip thumb touch . - The evaluator maximally flexes gymnast shoulder maintain wrist neutral position , elbow extend nose chin contact floor . - Once gymnast 's arm raise maximum height , distance dowel , thumbs touching , floor measure record near ½ centimeter use rigid measure stick . - The Shoulder flexibility Passive Motion test raw score calculate divide dowel height attain length gymnast 's arm . Shoulder Flexibility Active Motion test : - Prior shoulder flexibility testing , gymnast 's arm length measure tip acromion process ½ inch wooden dowel grasp hand hold shoulder flex 90 degree . - For test , gymnast lie prone firm floor chin nose touching floor . - Both arm hold parallel body shoulder flex 180 degree . - The gymnast grasp ½ inch dowel overhand grip tip thumb touch . - The gymnast ask maximally flex shoulder maintain wrist neutral position , elbow extend nose chin contact floor . - Once gymnast raise arm maximum height , distance dowel , thumbs touching , floor measure record near ½ centimeter use rigid measure stick . - The Shoulder flexibility test raw score calculate divide dowel height attain length gymnast 's arm . Hip Extension Flexibility test ( Thomas test ) : - Prior hip extension flexibility testing , gymnast lay flat examination table leg extend . The examiner place digital inclinometer anterior portion mid-thigh zero inclinometer . The examiner mark gymnast 's skin distal portion inclinometer contact gymnast . - Hip extension flexibility measure use modify Thomas test . - The gymnast instruct sit close edge examination table possible . - The gymnast support contralateral thigh arm , assistance examiner , slowly roll backward onto table . - The contralateral hip flex point gymnast 's lumbar lordosis flatten , right limb allow hang unsupported table . - The examiner palpate lumbar spine confirm remain contact table . - Thigh position also monitor prevent abduction thigh . - When final test position achieve examiner place inclinometer gymnast 's anterior thigh line make prior testing . - 0 degree indicate gymnast 's thigh parallel horizon . If thigh horizontal number digital inclinometer read negative . If thigh horizontal number positive . Dynamometer Testing : After receive standardized instruction , subject perform series familiarization trial consist three submaximal contraction per side . Then maximal voluntary contraction strength measure . The side test first randomize within test session . All maximal voluntary contraction strength data provide dynamometer ( kilogram ) normalize body weight . Shoulder Flexion Strength test : - Strength test performed hand hold dynamometer stabilize examiner . - For test , gymnast lie prone firm floor chin nose touching floor . - Both arm hold parallel body shoulder flex 180 degree . - The gymnast grasp ½ inch dowel overhand grip tip thumb touch . - The dynamometer pad locate ½ inch dowel gymnast thumb meet . - The gymnast ask maximally flex shoulder press dowel dynamometer pad hard maintain wrist neutral position , elbow extend nose chin contact floor . - Two three maximal voluntary contraction trial permit . A third trial complete difference first two maximal voluntary contraction &gt; 10 % . - The duration contraction 5 second , thirty second rest give trial . - If gymnast unable actively flex shoulder 180 degree strength test score 0 . Isometric maximal voluntary contraction strength hip muscle measure portable dynamometer fix custom make frame . The custom-made frame firmly fix physical therapy treatment table use screw clamp . The frame consist two vertical bar 1 horizontal bar attach vertical bar perpendicular extremity . The dynamometer fix horizontal bar test pad position properly test . Hip Extension Strength Dynamometer Test : - Gymnast prone position examination table test leg knee fully extend . Tested hip 5 degree extension knee full extension . - The dynamometer fix use custom make frame - The center dynamometer pad posterior aspect calcaneus - Gymnast tell stabilize hold onto examination table - Gymnasts instruct push hard dynamometer test pad . - Two three maximal voluntary contraction trial permit . A third trial complete difference first two maximal voluntary contraction &gt; 10 % . - The duration contraction 5 second , thirty second rest give trial . Hip Abduction Strength Dynamometer test : - Gymnast sidelying position examination table test leg knee fully extend . - The contralateral hip knee joint position approximately 30 degree flexion stability comfort . - Tested hip 10 degree abduction knee full extension . • . The center dynamometer pad locate 5 cm proximal lateral femoral condyle . - Gymnast tell stabilize hold onto examination table . - Gymnast instruct push hard dynamometer test pad . - The examiner inspect whole body position maximal voluntary contraction trial ensure minimal compensation pelvic rotation flexion rotation hip . If examiner judge much compensation , test record subject reinstructed proper test form . - Two three maximal voluntary contraction trial permit . A third trial complete difference first two maximal voluntary contraction &gt; 10 % . - The duration contraction 5 second , thirty second rest give trial .</detailed_description>
