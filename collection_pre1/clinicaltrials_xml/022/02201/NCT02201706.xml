	<brief_title>Multi-electrocoagulation Retinectomy Retinal Re-detachment Silicone Oil Filled Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relax retinectomy useful surgery retinal re-detachment eye silicone oil fill . However , obvious disadvantage cut normal retina surround , leave large area retinal deficiency significant exposure retinal pigment epithelium choroid membrane . In study , try apply modify surgery name Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy re-attach retina . Instead cut proliferate retina directly , new surgical approach adopts cut retina apart honeycomb shape help electrocoagulation . In way , relax traction proliferative membrane , also reserve rest retina cover RPE layer . Based hypothesis , aim explore safety efficacy new surgical approach</detailed_description>
