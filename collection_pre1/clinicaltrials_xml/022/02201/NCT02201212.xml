	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator evaluate clinical benefit everolimus cancer patient inactivate TSC1 TSC2 mutation activate MTOR mutation . This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug call everolimus learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve everolimus type cancer . Everolimus drug may stop cancer cell grow block important factor ( mTOR ) involve growth cell . This drug use treatment cancer approve Food Drug Administration treatment several type cancer , include renal cell carcinoma . Treatment drug associate response patient whose cancer mutation TSC1 TSC2 . The investigator think patient whose tumor mutation TSC1 TSC2 may good chance respond treatment drug like everolimus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients fulfill eligibility criterion enter trial.The participant give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) , time participant take study drug orally ( mouth ) daily . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . In addition administration study drug participant ask return clinic various time point additional exam perform . These study visit may last long 2 hour .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm advanced malignancy either metastatic and/or unresectable and/or recurrent , confirm inactivating mutation TSC1 TSC2 , activate mutation MTOR , identify CLIAcertified laboratory . All genetic finding must review study PI , Dr. David Kwiatkowski , prior study entry . Biopsy primary metastatic lesion must perform within past two year . Sufficient pathologic material must available enable whole exome sequencing time study entry . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Participants may receive number prior therapy , 0 &gt; 10 , prior treatment PI3kinase mTOR inhibitor permit . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 gr/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal . Patients confirm liver metastasis permit AST/ALT level ≤ 5X institutional upper limit normal . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal . Total cholesterol &lt; 300 mg/dL Triglycerides &lt; 250 mg/dL The effect everolimus develop human fetus unknown . For reason antineoplastic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants achieve either partial response stable disease ≥ 4 month must agree undergo tumor biopsy , safe feasible , time progressive disease study drug everolimus . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants follow : chemotherapy previous 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) radiotherapy within 3 week investigational agent within 3 week prior enter study patient recover significant ( opinion investigator ) adverse event due previous agent administer . ChildPugh B C hepatic impairment . Patients history hepatitis significant exposure risk test hepatitis B C serologic marker : HBsAg , HBs Ab , HBcoreIgG Ab , HCV Ab . Patients active hepatitis B C exclude . Any prior exposure PI3 kinase mTOR inhibitor agent . Participants may receive research study agent . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Asymptomatic treat brain metastasis acceptable . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition everolimus . A list prohibit medication study list Section 5.5 Chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study everolimus potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother everolimus , breastfeed discontinue mother treated everolimus . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals recent history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : 1 ) Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year OR deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy ; 2 ) Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Individuals know HIV infection exclude study combination antiretroviral therapy could potentially result significant pharmacokinetic interaction everolimus . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection due immunosuppressive effect mTOR inhibition . Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start Everolimus . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary .</criteria>
