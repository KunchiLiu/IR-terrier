	<detailed_description>The aim investigator study determine plasma FA composition ass change latter response n-3 supplementation French-Canadian youth since ( ) none available pharmacological agent could recommend treatment child NAFLD ; ( ii ) n-3 PUFA quite safe diet supplement show efficacy prevention therapy cardiovascular disease , dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome ; ( iii ) loss n-3 PUFA dietary intake find pediatric NAFLD ( iii ) attention give French-Canadian population , primarily historically locate province Quebec , high prevalence worldwide lipoprotein lipase deficiency , include large pool individual risk atherosclerosis lipid-related disease , exhibit founder effect among 8,000 ancestor present-day French-Canadians , relatively little cross-breeding individual national origin group . Subjects The present randomized clinical trial perform 30 NAFLD child follow outpatient Gastroenterology/Hepatology Nutrition clinic MCHU Ste-Justine Gastroenterology division Montreal Children 's Hospital , Montreal . The child 8 year 18 year age , obesity diagnostic NAFLD base result clinical evaluation , liver echography , magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction . Inclusion exclusion criteria The child eligible study boy ( accord literature review NAFLD prevalence ) , body weight ≥ 95th percentile ( base CDC Chart ) , age &lt; 18 year , diffusely hyperechogenic liver ultrasonography ( consistent NAFLD diagnostic ) , normal high transaminase ( &gt; 2N ) . Moreover , exclusion criterion base subject pin cochlear implant may affect magnetic resonance image examination ; subject consume natural medicine product increase risk haemorrhage , surgical procedure plan , child found consume fish , flaxseed oil food enrich n-3 PUFA ( egg , milk contain n-3 PUFA supplement ) , probiotic , vitamin E use drug know induce fatty liver study . Study design The present study 6-month , double-blind , one-way , crossover randomize study . The treatment consist n-3 PUFA supplement ( NutriSanté Inc./Ponroy , Canada ) , administer two phase , 3-month duration . In first phase , NAFLD group receive active n-3 PUFA supplement another receive equivalent quantity sunflower oil placebo . During second phase ( first 3 month ) , NAFLD subject receive active n-3 PUFA . The study approve Clinical Research Ethics Committee MUCH Ste-Justine ( Montreal , Quebec . Informed consent obtain subject start experimental procedure , study follow Helsinki guideline . Dosing The dose supplementation consider study 2.0 g fish oil per day , provide total 1.2 g n-3 PUFA . This dose chosen accord official recommendation , base previous study pediatric clinical trial . Compliance study treatment evaluate pill count every visit , review medication record , direct interview patient physician .</detailed_description>
