	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess effect teriflunomide comparison placebo disease activity measure time first clinical relapse randomization child adolescents 10 17 year age relapse form multiple sclerosis . Secondary Objectives : - To assess effect teriflunomide comparison placebo disease activity/progression measure brain MRI cognitive function . - To evaluate safety tolerability teriflunomide comparison placebo . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) teriflunomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Pharmacokinetics Teriflunomide Pediatric Patients With Relapsing Forms Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A screening period 4 week - A double-blind treatment period 96 week patient - An open-label period include remainder initial 96 week , applicable , 96-week extension , ie , maximum 192 week randomization - A follow-up period 4 week patient discontinue treatment Within 96 week double-blind treatment period , first 4 week pharmacokinetic ( PK ) run-in phase PK sample ( blood sample ) collect patient 4 week analysis ( sample draw ) . The PK run-in phase ( total 8 week ) intend provide individual PK parameter allow dose adjustment 14mg adult-equivalent dose rest study . Patients experience relapse PK run-in phase ( 8 week ) confirm Relapse Adjudication Panel ( RAP ) patient fulfil MRI criterion ( high number new lesion week 36 , 48 72 compare previous image ) option continue open label teriflunomide treatment arm 192 week randomisation .</detailed_description>
