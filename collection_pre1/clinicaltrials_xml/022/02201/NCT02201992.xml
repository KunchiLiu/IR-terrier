	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well crizotinib work compare placebo treat patient stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery mutation protein call anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) . Mutations , change , ALK make active important tumor cell growth progression . Crizotinib may stop growth tumor cell block ALK protein work . Crizotinib may effective treatment patient non-small cell lung cancer ALK fusion mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crizotinib Treating Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Removed Surgery ALK Fusion Mutations ( An ALCHEMIST Treatment Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy crizotinib result improve overall survival ( OS ) placebo patient stage IB &gt; = 4 cm , II IIIA , ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) follow surgical resection . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) associate crizotinib placebo . II . To evaluate safety profile crizotinib give adjuvant therapy setting . III . To collect tumor tissue blood specimens future research . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive crizotinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
