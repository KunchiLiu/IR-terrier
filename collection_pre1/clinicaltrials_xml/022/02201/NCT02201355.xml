	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : To determine whether patient T1/2N0-2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx tolerate treatment cisplatin chemoradiation three week use reduced volume IMRT Secondary Objectives : To describe adverse event associate hypofractionated , reduce volume cisplatin chemoradiation . To estimate response rate progression-free survival rate hypofractionated , reduce volume cisplatin chemoradiation . To determine HRQOL follow hypofractionated , reduced volume cisplatin chemoradiation . If patient safely treat three week rather six week , schedule would provide much convenient alternative patient result significant reduction health care resource currently expend cure patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Reduced-Volume Chemoradiation T1/2N0-2 SCC Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) frequently occur tumor 500,000 new case worldwide 45,000 USA yearly . Most patient present local-regionally advanced disease . Chemotherapy give concurrently radiation integrate treatment component management patient . Concurrent chemoradiation give unresectable disease , organ preservation avoid surgery preserve function , high risk patient surgery . Randomized clinical trial meta-analyses show concurrent chemoradiation superior radiation alone setting . One way reduce overall treatment time toxicity reduce number fraction increase daily radiotherapy dose . The consequence increase daily dose increase acute side effect well increase late toxicity . A widely accept model radiobiologic effect range typical 2-4 Gy daily fraction alpha-beta model distinguishes acute response late response base linear-quadratic fitting extrapolate clonogenic survival curve . A time factor incorporated account effect repopulation . Equivalent biologically effective dose schedule use reduced number fraction may calculate conventionally fractionated course . Because 70Gy/35/6 week chemoradiation demonstrate tolerable , 66Gy/30/6 week show IMRT produce 90 % control T1/2 oropharyngeal primary tumor , take biological equivalent 66Gy/33 fraction six week biologic equivalent standard wish maintain hypofractionated course radiation . Because 54Gy/30 six week well-known elective radiation dose schedule produce 95 % control occult nodal disease , take biologically equivalent standard wish maintain hypofractionated schedule .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . T1/2N02M0 SCC oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx 2 . Age ≥ 18 year . 3 . Performance status ECOG 01 4 . Adequate organ marrow function determine medical oncology evaluation . 5 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 6 . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . 7 Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . 8 . Creatinine clearance ( CC ) ≥ 50 ml/min within 4 week prior registration determine 24hour collection estimate CockcroftGault formula : CCr male = [ ( 140 age ) x ( wt kg ) ] / [ ( Serum Cr mg/dl ) x ( 72 ) ] ( CCr female = 0.85 x ( CrCl male ) ) . 9 . History/physical examination within 4 week prior registration , include assessment weight weight loss past 6 month . 10 . Medical oncology examination evaluate medical contraindication prior start chemotherapy 11 Dental evaluation management prior start radiation 12 Nutrition evaluation consideration percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube placement 13 No distant metastasis PET/CT 1 . T3/4 N3 2 . T1N0 disease 3 . Metastatic disease 4 . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year 5 . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field 6 . Primary site tumor oral cavity , nasopharynx , sinus , salivary gland 7 . Neck adenopathy involve overlie skin . 8 . Initial surgical treatment include tonsillectomy neck dissection , exclude diagnostic biopsy primary site nodal sample neck disease 9 . Preexisting grade &gt; 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy 10 . Subjects may receive investigational agent . 11 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 12 . Subjects must pregnant nursing due potential congenital abnormality potential regimen harm nursing infant .</criteria>
