	<brief_summary>Breast lift surgery perform combination breast implant common cosmetic operation . However , concern regard safety treatment combination . Some investigator concern implant may increase risk complication , include loss circulation nipple areola . This study undertaken evaluate blood supply breast use intraoperative laser fluorescent image determine whether breast implant compromise blood supply nipple areola .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Fluorescent Imaging Nipple Areola During Breast Lift</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Laser Fluorescent Imaging Breasts During Vertical Breast Lifts Reductions Performed Combination Breast Implants . Background/Purpose Today , breast lifts common operation . Implants may recommend provide great fullness upper pole breast . One risk surgery compromised circulation nipple areolae . Some investigator believe simultaneous insertion breast implant add risk cause pressure overlie breast tissue skin.1 Staging procedure ( first breast lift implant vice versa ) recommend , stag inconvenient costly patient , necessitate two operation . Clinical experience newer vertical breast lift technique , oppose traditional inferior pedicle technique , favorable , report complications.2 The vertical technique use short , superficial pedicle traditional inferior pedicle , reliable blood supply.2 A breast lift reduction essentially operation ; breast tissue remove reduction dissection . This study undertaken investigate blood supply nipple areolae combine breast lift/reduction implant procedure . Laser fluorescent image represent objective measurement technique use several year monitor vascularity flap use breast reconstruction . Subjects Fifteen consecutive consenting adult woman undergo outpatient elective breast lifts reduction combination breast implant investigate . By test blood supply two time point , patient serf control . Imaging The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System ( Lifecell Corp. , Branchburg , NJ ) consist near-infrared laser detects fluorescence . The imaging agent , indocyanine green , absorb 800-810 nm . The imaging agent inject intravenously . Starting within 5-10 second injection , system record image breast , show fluorescence , indicate blood supply . The half-life imaging agent 2.5-3 minute . Surgery The implant insert breast lift/reduction procedure perform side use vertical technique.2 The implant inflate . The filling tube leave place . At point , 3 mL ( 7.5 mg ) indocyanine green inject image record , document blood supply breast . Next , implant inflate use fill tube . After inflation implant , breast reimaged , fill tube still place . Once adequate circulation demonstrate , fill tube remove . In unlikely event inadequate circulation find imaging , implant volume may reduce accordingly , third image take confirm adequate circulation nipple . Null Hypothesis A breast lift reduction perform use vertical technique combination insertion breast implant compromise circulation nipple areolae may safely perform simultaneously , avoid need stag surgery . Informed Consent Patients informed nature study tell participation entirely voluntary free decline , way prejudice treatment . Patients inform small risk allergic reaction treat occurs . Patient Risk There patient risk apart small risk allergic reaction , reduce excluding patient know allergy iodinate contrast dye . The study affect patient treatment . It offer possibility detection reduce skin circulation , information use surgeon limit implant volume , forego simultaneous insertion necessary reduce risk tissue loss delay wound healing , know complication breast lifts reduction . Sample Size A sample 15 patient anticipate , treated period approximately 5 month . Disclosure The author financial interest product , device , drug mention article . The author conflict interest disclose . There outside funding study .</detailed_description>
