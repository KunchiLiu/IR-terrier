	<brief_title>Active Warming During Elective Caesearean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When baby deliver surgical procedure ( caesarean section ) woman usually `` spinal '' anaesthetic . With `` spinal '' , local anaesthetic inject spinal fluid make woman numb chest foot , allow comfortable awake birth . During type anaesthetic common lose heat become cold `` hypothermic '' measure less 36 degree Celsius . Becoming cold uncomfortable woman also cause problem . It make blood clotting less effective , alter way wound heal afterwards make woman likely develop infection problem related heart lung . To help keep temperature stable , investigator give woman fluid vein already warm ensure well insulated cold surface . There two machine investigator also use actively warm patient yet use every case . The first method call `` Forced Air Warming '' use special disposable sheet woman lie upon lot air pocket warm air blow continuously fan . The woman surround pocket warm air , help warm also insulate heat loss . The second method call `` Conduction Warming Mattress '' use thin mattress cover operate table woman lie top . The padded mattress strip material heat electricity pass , similar normal electric blanket . The investigator already look record woman caesarean section hospital find force air warm conduction mattress warm seem help stay warm . However , investigator would like study detail prove scientifically whether method effective . Our aim study see warm machine help prevent woman get cold , prove scientifically whether one effective . The hypothesis study active warm woman elective caesarean section prevents woman 's temperature drop keep comfortable active warming use . The woman exactly anaesthetic would study . If woman agree study choose randomly receive either , normal care ( include warm fluid warm machine ) , additional warming force air additional warm conduction mattress . Her temperature measure regular interval , caesarean section , time ask score thermal comfort scale . The result analyse compare temperature change group . The investigator hope active warm machine keep body temperature stable prevent hypothermia . If investigator find machine prevent woman get cold , ensure effective method warm caesarean section operation use minimise problem due become cold .</detailed_description>
