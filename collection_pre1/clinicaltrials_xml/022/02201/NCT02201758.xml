	<brief_summary>This study propose examine effect diet modifiable risk factor among patient ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Flax seed contain many bioactive constituent anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory , anti-carcinogenic effect . These bioactive compound represent novel class pharmacologically active compound may represent new option treat chronic disease gastrointestinal tract . Participants mild moderately severe UC supplement current medication flaxseed lignan-enriched complex ( FLC ) . This 12 week double blind placebo control study assessment throughout . Stool blood sample ( biomarkers ) well bowel assessment via sigmoidoscopy evaluate intervention . The treatment arm consist 300 mg FLC take orally twice daily .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flaxseed Lignan-Enriched Complex ( FLC ) Treatment Patients With Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) : A Pilot Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project single center , randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study subject recruit study undergo treatment FLC 8-week period . The investigator recruit patient mild moderately severe , left-sided pan-colonic UC ( Mayo Score 3 - 10 point ) . All participant vitamin D status evaluate baseline clinically indicate laboratory investigation include complete blood count ( CBC ) , liver enzymes serologic inflammatory marker high sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) . Participants evaluate week 0 , 2 , 4 8 treatment period week 10 follow-up . Exclusion criterion include colectomy , positive stool culture common bacterial pathogen , history drug alcohol abuse , mental illness , concomitant immunological , hematologic neoplastic disease , hepatic insufficiency , cardiac insufficiency , pregnancy , treatment anti-tumor necrosis factor agent within 3 month , local steroid precede 30 day , antibiotic le 15 day screen . Participants may continue concomitant medication stable dosage least 12 week screen ( medication include mesalamine , thiopurines , methotrexate , probiotic ) . Participants continue current medication she/he stable ; washout period require . FLC supplement therapy ; dosage concomitant medication must maintain constant throughout study . The introduction biologics , steroid , antibiotic dose increase exist medication study consider treatment failure . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize computer-generated algorithm 1:1 fashion one two treatment arm . Treatment arm 1 consist 300 mg FLC take orally twice daily . The 600 mg dose FLC base clinical research suggest minimum dose 500 mg/day dose FLC tolerable necessary observe significant health benefit ( i.e . reduction cardiovascular risk ) . The placebo consist unflavored whey protein ( manufactured Natural Factors® ) . FLC placebo packet prepare study personnel College Pharmacy Nutrition supervision license pharmacist . Participants investigator blind treatment allocation . The primary outcome interest comparative proportion subject complete study week 8 . Secondary endpoint include proportion week 8 clinical responder ( define Mayo Score reduction ≥ 3 point ) proportion subject post-therapy fecal calprotectin ( Cp ) concentration ≤ 150 μg/g week 8 . The study power detect primary endpoint , proportion subject complete study week 8 FLC versus placebo treat group . Power calculation base upon two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( α = 0.05 ) estimate study completion rate 0.40 placebo treat group 0.80 FLC treat group indicate 28 subject need recruit per group order detect difference ( β = 0.80 ) . Relevant covariates include smoking status , gender , age , disease duration disease severity compare intervention placebo group use χ2 test independence categorical variable ANOVA continuous variable . Missing data handle multiple imputation technique appropriate sensitivity analysis investigate effect different imputation method . The use FLC complex hold promise attenuating inflammation find IBD . The investigator suspect use FLC patient mild moderately severe UC well-tolerated efficacious . Data derive pilot study inform plan future national , double-blind , placebo control intervention trial therapeutic potential flaxseed derive product IBD first study kind investigate FLC therapy IBD . The data derive pilot study help determine whether flaxseed derive bioactives safe cost-effective alternative therapeutic option treatment patient IBD .</detailed_description>
