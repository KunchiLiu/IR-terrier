	<brief_summary>Poor ovarian response stimulation IVF cycle challenge frustrate condition , due poor prognosis term chance pregnancy live birth . Various ovarian stimulation regimen try overcome obstacle . A simple approach increase dose gonadotropin administration , result term pregnancy rate low Another commonly use stimulation regimen microdose GnRH agonist protocol , take advantage initial rise endogenous gonadotropin follow agonist administration early follicular phase subsequently prevent premature LH surge , few cycle cancellation . However , application poor responder , even small dos limited period , question may cause oversuppression ovarian function , lead prolonged cycle increase treatment cost without improve outcome . Recently , GnRH antagonists introduce ART treatment . They effective prevent premature LH surge allow natural recruitment follicle follicular phase non-suppressed ovary , offer potential alternative treatment patient . However , randomized study evaluate efficacy regimen poor responder show improvements pregnancy rate . Current approach include addition oral agent u clomiphene citrate ( CC ) gonadotropins . Some author investigate role CC addition low dose gonadotropin mild stimulation regimen , demonstrate , despite small number retrieve oocyte , good quality embryo produce subsequent improvement fertilization rate , clinical pregnancy rate live birth rate . The study evaluate efficacy CC addition high dos gonadotropin poor responder show improve number retrieve oocyte , transfer embryos biochemical pregnancy ; however , clinical pregnancy rate live birth rate remain low show measurable increase . The aim study compare efficacy CC adjunctive high dose gonadotropin cycle antagonist protocol microdose GnRH agonist flexible antagonist protocol woman respond poorly ovarian stimulation , determine whether protocol may improve IVF outcome , offer valid alternative poor responder patient treatment .</brief_summary>
