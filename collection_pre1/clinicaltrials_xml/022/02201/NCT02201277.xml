	<brief_summary>This research study prospective randomize trial evaluate relative safety two inferior vena cava ( IVC ) filter use prevent migration potentially dangerous deadly blood clot legs lung patient take blood thinner . All eligible patient order IVC filter place primary medical team filter place patient whether wish participate trial part standard care . The investigator follow patient 30 day IVC filter placement ask come back filter removal medically appropriate . If removal medically appropriate 30 day , investigator attempt schedule removal every 30 day initial placement . Primary outcome measure IVC filter complication filter penetration IVC wall organ , filter tilt , filter migration , filter fracture clot form within filter . All report complication IVC filter . The research also aim improve standard care IVC filter patient follow FDA Society Interventional Radiology recommend IVC filter remove soon safe . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize significant difference efficacy complication rate Option Denali filter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ODEN Trial : Option vs. Denali IVC Filters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized trial compare two FDA-approved inferior vena cava filter , Denali retrievable IVC filter ( Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc. , Tempe , AZ ) Option Elite ( Argon Medical , Athens , Texas ) . Patients schedule IVC filter placement UCSF Department Interventional Radiology ( IR ) ask IR physician performing procedure either UCSF Mt . Zion Moffitt hospital wish participate prospective , randomize study . Recruitment conduct physician perform IR procedure . No additional recruitment call , email , poster web page necessary . All procedure randomization one two experimental group carefully explain obtain sign write consent . Screening : Screening conduct IR physician prior placement IVC filter . Since standard care study , patient recommend IVC filter placement schedule procedure generally eligible . The screening procedure part routine care IVC filter placement would do even patient join study . The study doctor review result recent routine care image scan ( CT MRI ) abdomen pelvis . This do confirm diameter IVC wider 2.8cm . Both filter FDA-approved place IVC maximal diameter 2.8cm . The study doctor also review ultrasound low extremity , available , confirm blood clot fact present prior perform study . This ensure patient present IVC filter placement screen properly . The follow screening procedure do within 12 day IVC filter placement procedure part standard care . - A complete physical exam - The study doctor ask medical history well patient able daily activity - Routine care blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) This ensure INR platelet count patient within safe limit perform invasive procedure . After Enrollment : If screen procedure show patient eligible consent take part study , IVC filter placement occur randomization . After enrollment , follow procedure do study : Just screening , procedure part regular IVC filter placement care . Randomization : Randomization occur day procedure prior clinic visit IR physician either Denali Option IVC filter . All IR attend physician protocol familiar placement either filter type . Prior open study accrual , 75 seal security envelope word Denali print card inside 75 sealed security envelope word Option assemble IR staff involve research . The envelope mix place bag . Computerized randomization program table consider feel envelope work best may limited time patient consent procedure begin . This especially true filter place emergently . Previous IR study use randomization technique great success . Filter Placement : Placement IVC filter involve insertion plastic tube ( catheter ) vein neck . Some numbing medicine ( Lidocaine ) inject skin vein catheter insert . Intravenous medication give induce moderate sedation ( Fentanyl analgesic Versed moderate sedation ) . Once catheter place vein , advance IVC . Once correct position , x-ray contrast material ( x-ray dye-Omnipaque 350 ) inject catheter x-ray picture take . A series x-ray picture obtain IVC . These picture take part standard care determine position renal vein respect IVC . The top filter must sit renal vein cause obstruction renal vein . In addition , picture IVC take serve another tool measure diameter IVC make sure diameter IVC le 2.8cm . This particularly important situation CT MRI abdomen pelvis available review prior procedure . Once picture obtain make certain IVC diameter less 2.8cm , filter insert catheter , place renal vein . During placement procedure , position filter monitor x-ray picture . At completion procedure catheter remove pressure apply insertion site bleeding stop . All part routine standard care placement filter . The doctor perform procedure ask complete short questionnaire IVC filter placement attach `` Study Documents '' . Follow-Up : After IVC filter placement procedure patient status follow interventional radiology doctor . Per standard care IVC filter placement , patient monitor hospital 1 hour procedure . If patient stable condition sedation resolve , return home day return hospital room . A tentative appointment follow filter retrieval order IR physician time filter placement APEX . This ensure schedule study staff aware patient primary care follow-up require . Patient primary care physician and/or relevant medical staff telephone one month IVC filter placement determine patient medically stable suitable IVC filter removal . If IR doctor agree IVC filter removal recommend , patient schedule return follow-up imaging filter retrieval . If patient medically stable still high risk blood clot , attempt schedule follow one month later . Close contact primary physician patient maintain ensure filter remove soon possible . APEX schedule use make sure follow perform regular interval . At follow-up appointment routine test per standard care IVC filter removal perform : - A physical exam - The study doctor ask medical history , well patient able daily activity , experience possible symptom relate IVC filter placement abdominal back pain . - A rotation CT focus site filter perform part routine practice filter removal . This do ensure filter migrate filter penetrated wall IVC filter retrieval would unsafe . - IR physician determine patient status stable safe IVC filter removal . If , physician discus primary care doctor filter need remain permanently patient later retrieval consider subsequent follow visit . - IVC filter retrieval perform moderate sedation . This procedure similar nature filter placement procedure . The IVC filter remove via similar process way place . X-ray dye ( contrast ) inject around filter assure filter area beneath filter free blood clot safe proceed removal . A catheter-based snare use engage hook end filter filter envelop removal sheath remove body .</detailed_description>
