	<detailed_description>This real world study since give best opportunity properly examine effect multi-drug regimen representative population . Including standard care arm inappropriate , population standard care already show ineffective intolerable . Patients send study clinic directly Health Care Professionals ( `` HCP 's '' ) . The study consist pre-screening visit determine eligibility inclusion study , initiation visit follow visit every three month thereafter . If require , unscheduled visit may take place . Day 0 ( baseline ) patient initiation visit study treatment start . Prior conduct study-related procedure , subject provide write informed consent , eligibility assess , medical history past medical record take vital sign measure . These record include stage disease , response previous cancer therapy , prior current medication specific regimen currently cancer . If prior medical record contain sufficient information determine baseline patient , additional blood test scan undertaken appropriate . Patients monitor quarterly thereafter blood test ( e.g . safety parameter , glucose , cholesterol , immune response cancer marker applicable ) scan ( applicable ) take . Patients complete quality life questionnaire baseline every 3 month . This comprise generic EQ-5D instrument disease- specific questionnaire ( FACT European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire [ EORTC-QLQ ] ) . All patient drug regimen ( see ) dos throughout study . All patient follow choose leave study , death . Data patient recruit study analyse use Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) philosophy , data include primary analysis irrespective whether dose regimen follow throughout study . If appropriate , number allow , analysis also conduct Per Protocol population , comprise patient adhere regimen prescribe . Survival analysis method use estimate PFS associate study regimen type cancer . Estimates PFS present various time point ( specify ) associate confidence interval . These estimate interpret light data obtain literature , elicit expert opinion . Bayesian method may use appropriate . Overall survival investigate similar way . The pattern response regimen quality life investigate use repeat measure , mixed model analysis variance derive estimate change EQ-VAS utility score derive EQ-5D key time point . The data may also use calculate Quality-adjusted Life Years ( QALYs ) use health economic evaluation . Similar method use disease-specific instrument . The estimate change interpret light publish data meaningful change variable . Separate estimate produce type cancer appropriate . Data show graph . Tumour response , applicable , summarised table graph . Estimates response rate present cancer type confidence interval . The relationship change biochemistry value ( glucose , lipid ) efficacy outcome ( Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , Overall Survival ( OS ) HRQoL ) investigate graphically , use method appropriate . Further exploratory analysis investigate effect factor age , ethnic background , cancer stage , response prior therapy , also conduct order try characterise profile patient likely benefit study regimen . The characteristic patient regimen stay regimen , whatever reason , summarise see whether observed bias . If appropriate , method use adjust observe bias , example use propensity score . OS assess adjust try mitigate possible risk bias occur uncontrolled study . Furthermore , enrol eligible patient specify time frame , hop risk bias reduce . In addition , large number patient expect participate study .</detailed_description>
