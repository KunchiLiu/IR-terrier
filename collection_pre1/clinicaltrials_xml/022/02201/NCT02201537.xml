	<detailed_description>Kidney transplant patient expose long-term immunosuppressive therapy , increase risk infection cancer , lack treatment increase risk rejection . The development image technique characterize status graft remain challenge transplantation . Ideally , identify complication ( acute rejection , chronic allograft nephropathy , nephrotoxicity ... ) without need invasive procedure thus lead good customization immunosuppressive therapy . The post-transplant follow-up base monitoring graft function . Impaired function suggest possibility complication , require confirmation invasive procedure renal biopsy . In addition , diagnosis remain complex relatively advanced stage process due damage graft parenchyma . To anticipate altered function detect subclinical lesion , screen biopsy use diagnose chronic rejection . By definition , screen subclinical lesion base biological parameter ; diagnosis subclinical complication thus require perform multiple systematic biopsy , schedule 3 month 1 year . Doppler ultrasound image method choice study renal transplant , diagnose NCT due absence specific finding . The lack early diagnostic test NCT major obstacle development evaluation new therapeutic option prevent , slow stabilize renal fibrosis . It therefore necessary develop non-invasive imaging technique early diagnosis NCT . Ultrasound elastography technique allow tissue stiffness measurement provide parametric picture . The main objective study evaluate performance elastography measurement renal perfusion ( area ROC curve ) diagnose NCT determine measure threshold maximize sensitivity . These performance evaluate 3 month 12 month . The result also compare image modality functional MRI , clinical event ( obstruction , infection… ) . Functional ultrasound image identify diagnostic prognostic criterion NCT , enable development less invasive therapeutic protocol evaluate new therapeutic approach</detailed_description>
