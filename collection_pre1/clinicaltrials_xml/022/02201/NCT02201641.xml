	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate tooth nerve response recently introduce therapeutic filling material ( calcium silicate cement ) call Biodentine ass quality overlie filling compare another material ( glass ionomer cement ) call Fuji IX use commonly . Also compare effectiveness cone beam compute tomography x-ray compare conventional periapical x-ray detect lesion around teeth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Calcium Silicate Pulp-capping ; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tooth decay one widespread diseases world . Very often , patient come dental clinic experience pain commonly mean decay deep close penetrated nerve tooth . When decay close pulp nerve tooth , procedure call pulp cap do attempt save tooth prevent root canal treatment . A material introduce market purpose , call Biodentine . This study aim investigate nerve response material ass quality overlie filling compare another material ( glass ionomer cement ) use commonly . Also , X-rays routine procedure use assess close decay nerve see abnormality around tooth . However conventional X-rays may accurate . A new technique call Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) develop show 3-D image tooth may accurate . We aim compare image gain conventional X-rays CBCT help improve diagnosis care plan patient .</detailed_description>
