	<brief_summary>The study population include patient undergoing elective CABG . Consent randomization occur surgery . Total 500 patient undergoing elective CABG randomly assign three group 1:1:1 ratio ( 167 patient per group ) open-label study . All enrol patient stop oral antiplatelet drug accord local protocol surgery . Within first 24 hour surgery , study medication restart continue 12 month . Arm A restart oral antiplatelet drug give aspirin 100mg qd , Arm B also restart oral antiplatelet drug give ticagrelor 90mg bid plus aspirin 100mg qd Arm C also restart oral antiplatelet drug give ticagrelor 90mg bid . Treatment continue 12 month , time patient undergo multislice compute tomography angiography ass vein graft patency . This study design show superiority ticagrelor ticagrelor plus aspirin compare aspirin monotherapy respectively 1-year primary efficacy end point vein graft patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design show superiority ticagrelor ticagrelor plus aspirin compare aspirin monotherapy respectively 1-year primary efficacy end point vein graft patency . The primary comparison include two separate part . One demonstrate T+A well A T well A . One year rate vein graft patency aspirin group estimate 80 % . The assumed rate ticagrelor plus aspirin 90 % . With two-sided alpha level 0.05 80 % power , 199 graft group require . On hand , assume rate ticagrelor monotherapy 1-year vein graft patency rate 87 % , two-sided 0.05 alpha 441 graft arm offer 80 % power show superiority ticagrelor along primary efficacy end point . Combined two assumption , allocation rate 1:1:1 , study need recruit 1,323 graft total ( 441 ) achieve pre-specified power two comparison ( T+A vs. A T vs. A ) . The principle investigator assume average number vien graft one patient 2.7-3.0 . With assumption , 500 patient recruit , provide u total 1350 - 1500 graft . According , study confirmatory clinical trial primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
