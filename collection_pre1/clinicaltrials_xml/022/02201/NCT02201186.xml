	<brief_title>To Determine Effect Honey Enema Treatment Patients With Acute Pouchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pouchitis common long-term complication ileal pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Pouchitis define clinical syndrome watery , frequent , time bloody stool accompany urgency , incontinence , abdominal cramp , malaise , fever . The PDAI ( Pouchitis Disease Activity Index ) provide standardized definition pouchitis base clinical , endoscopic , histological marker . Pouchitis define score ≥ 7 remission score &lt; 7 . Recently , modify Pouchitis Disease Activity Index use omit biopsy histology standard PDAI . Omission endoscopic biopsy histology PDAI simplify pouchitis diagnostic criterion , reduces cost diagnosis , avoids delay associate determine histology score , provide equivalent sensitivity specificity . Patients acute pouchitis manage routinely antibiotics Ciprofloxacin Metronidazole . This treatment side effect , expensive , fails respond patient . Some patient unresponsive antibiotic therapy need pouchectomy ileostomy do . On hand , multiple study show honey , especially manuka honey anti-inflammatory , anti-bacterial , wound healing , anti-ulcerous effect . Phenolic compound honey , flavonoid , report exhibit wide range biological activity , include antibacterial , antiviral , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , antitumor , anti-allergic , vasodilatory action . This honey clear infection , remove malodour , reduce inflammation pain , cause edema exudation subside , increase rate heal stimulation angiogenesis , granulation epithelialization . Due problem associate antibiotic therapy , side effect , cost failure patient respond , look find alternative method treat acute pouchitis . This study design determine effect manuka honey symptom , sign pathology acute pouchitis patient . We select patient sign symptom pouchitis , abdominal pain , fever , frequency urgency defecation . Proctoscopy do honey enema modify PDAI score determine . The manuka honey enema administer twice day , one month . Then , modify PDAI score completion honey enema treatment patient , compare . We know bacterial overgrowth , ischemia , faecal stasis , recurrence ulcerative colitis pouch , possibly novel third form inflammatory bowel disease , possible etiology pouchitis . We also know manuka honey anti-inflammatory anti-bacterial property . Some study demonstrate honey effective treatment induce colitis animal model . However , current literature effect honey colitis pouchitis human . Based aforementioned property honey , consider probable etiology pouchitis , expect patient respond method treatment . Some research do effect honey treatment colitis animal model , clinical study assess treatment pouchitis , even colitis , human . Considering etiology pouchitis , inflammation bacterial overgrowth , consider main effect honey , anti-bacterial anti-inflammatory efficacy , honey enema may useful treatment pouchitis . Our study try determine effect manuka honey enema treatment acute pouchitis . We try determine whether honey enema help decrease inflammation infection pouch , thereby provide u safe alternative method treatment pouchitis . In pilot study , select patient sign symptom acute pouchitis , abdominal pain , fever , frequency , urgency defecation . Proctoscopy perform patient . Ten patient modify PDAI score ≥ 7 receive honey enema twice day one month . We choose twice daily enema regimen , patient inflammatory bowel disease usually receive enemas twice day . We expect one month enough time , duration antibiotic therapy patient acute pouchitis one month . Then , PDAI score patient , honey enema compare .</detailed_description>
