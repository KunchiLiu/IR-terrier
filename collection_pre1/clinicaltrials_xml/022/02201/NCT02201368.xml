	<brief_title>Triheptanoin Treatment Trial Patients With Long-chain Fatty Acid Beta-oxidation Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triheptanoin treatment , patient long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation defect , could cause great improvement quality life , also could prevent life-threatening sign , reduce symptom serious complication disease , like cardiomyopathy , Reye-like syndrome episode rhabdomyolysis . This result would occur effect propionyl CoA primer Krebs cycle , time , would produce gluconeogenic effect . This treatment open door use disease pyruvate carboxylase deficiency , glycogen storage disease diseases energy problem . All patient follow 16 month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient follow condition : Longchain 3hydroxyacylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency ( LCHAD ) . Very longchain acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency ( VLCAD . ) Mitochondrial trifunctional protein ( MTP ) . Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency ( CPT I ) . Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II ( CPT II ) . Carnitineacylcarnitine translocase deficiency ( CACT ) . Positive skin biopsy : patient deem commence dietary treatment Triheptanoin evaluate individual response vitro culture fibroblast . This response base measurement production propionylCoA , incubation fatty acid oddchain , compare control group fibroblast . The informed consent must sign patient family , case minor . No patient/family collaboration application dietary treatment . No vitro test response . Do meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
