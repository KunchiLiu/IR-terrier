	<detailed_description>Incomplete spontaneous abortion ( ISA ) define intrauterine retention conceptual product incomplete partial expulsion conceptual product . Treatment retention may expectant care , medical treatment surgery . Currently , curettage standard surgical treatment center . However , operative hysteroscopy , addition direct visualization retain conceptual product , contrast curettage , would allow elective evacuation retention reduce surgical complication . Studies low effective , retrospective , find fertility 's increase patient treat operative hysteroscopy . These data need confirm randomize control trial order change standard surgical treatment disease hysteroscopy procedure would find superior . We propose multicenter - single blind - randomize - therapeutic study . Randomization concern surgical procedure patient treat surgically intrauterine retention spontaneous miscarriage . Randomization perform admission patient operate room electronic mean use secure internet platform , single-blind patient unblinding end trial case complication . The patient randomly assign one two treatment arm follow : - Arm A : Operative hysteroscopy - Arm B : Aspirative curettage The inclusion perform time diagnosis ( incomplete miscarriage ) ultrasound intrauterine retention surgical treatment decide . The initial medical examination ( inclusion visit ) include complete gynecological examination . The diagnosis incomplete miscarriage perform use transvaginal pelvic ultrasound . Transvaginal ultrasound perform accord technique standardize pelvic ultrasound ; retention diagnose presence heterogeneous image intrauterine gestational sac 15 mm thickness . On visit , patient complete questionnaire concern medical history abort pregnancy . Patients care accordance center practice hospital stay . Surgical treatment perform within time depend availability operate room participate center . A hospitalization report indicate participation study , mention treatment group , send attend physician patient . An information form postoperative instruction give patient include protocol without mention surgical arm . The operative report give patient end participation trial . A total five visit ( include final visit ) schedule trial . The patient monitor form telephone conversation questionnaire send email post . Monitoring do investigator enrol patient help URC charge project . In case complication , failure intervention diagnosis uterine cavity pathology , care leave discretion medical center team .</detailed_description>
