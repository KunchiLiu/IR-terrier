	<brief_summary>Persons without spleen susceptible potentially lethal infection certain bacteria , pneumococcus prevalent . Vaccines provide help protect infection , though certainty . Trauma patient sustain injury spleen currently three treatment option available treat surgeon - nonoperative management , embolization , removal spleen . The purpose study investigate antibody response pneumococcal vaccine patient undergo mode therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study multi-institutional , prospective trial , conduct primarily University California , Davis Medical Center ( UCDMC ) Department Surgery , Division Trauma Acute Care Surgery . The angioembolization arm multicenter nonoperative group enrol UCDMC . There total 90 subject , 30 three arm ( nonoperative , angioembolization , splenectomy ) . Adult trauma patient ( define age 18 65 year old ) sustain splenic injury plan nonoperative management , eligible enrollment nonoperative arm . The management decision splenic injury entirely discretion attend trauma surgeon . Any patient subsequently undergoes embolization splenectomy withdrawn study . Adult trauma patient sustain splenic injury undergo splenic artery embolization eligible enrollment arm study . The management decision splenic injury entirely discretion attend trauma surgeon radiologist . All patient undergo successful splenic artery embolization ( subsequent splenectomy splenorrhaphy , i.e. , cross-over ) eligible . Patients manage nonoperatively vaccinate within three day diagnosis , per standard operate protocol UCDMC . At time vaccination , 7cc venous blood collect baseline antibody analysis . Patients return four week later follow-up phlebotomy another 7cc blood analysis functional antipneumococcal antibody generate response vaccine antigen challenge . Blood sample centrifuge store , store serum sent batch dry ice Flow Applications , Inc. McDonough , Georgia antibody analysis . All sample assign unique patient identifier . Responses 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine measure ELISA determine geometric mean increase IgG antibody titer pneumococcal polysaccharide ( Pnc Ps ) serotypes . Functional antibody , measure percent kill know pneumococcal concentration , determine opsonophagocytosis assay ( OPA ) . Titers serogroup 4 serotypes 6B , 19F , 23F measure , geometric mean rise antibody concentration determine measure response vaccination . For treated nonoperative management , degree antibody response grade splenic injury analyze normal control . Patients treat via splenic artery embolization undergo standard post-embolization compute tomographic exam abdomen three five day postinjury evaluate effectiveness embolization procedure . The percent viable , perfuse spleen calculate CT. Antibody response compare location intravascular coil ( i.e. , proximal versus distal embolization ) percent viable spleen calculate follow-up CT scan .</detailed_description>
