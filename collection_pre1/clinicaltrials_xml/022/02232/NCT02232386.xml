	<brief_summary>The present study aim evaluate whether treatment two different drug , Ibrutinib Rituximab efficient safe newly diagnose patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Assess Activity &amp; Safety Front-line Ibrutinib + Rituximab Unfit Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given : - Ibrutinib single agent associate high response rate PFS previously treat patient , patient poor prognosis clinical biologic feature . - Ibrutinib single agent proven activity associate good safety profile elderly patient CLL . - The Ibrutinib plus Rituximab combination associate high response rate PFS previously treat patient , patient poor prognosis clinical biologic feature . - The combined administration Ibrutinib Rituximab could effective safe front-line treatment schedule unfit patient CLL . - The current study design evaluate whether first line treatment Ibrutinib Rituximab result significant improvement PFS 12 month compare chlorambucil plus rituximab patient unfit fludarabine- bendamustine-based treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 18 year age old . 2 . Diagnosis CLL meeting IWCLL criterion . 3 . The diagnosis CLL require history lymphocytosis Blymphocyte count ≥5,000/μL . Prolymphocytes may comprise 55 % blood lymphocyte . 4 . Active disease meeting least 1 follow IWCLL 2008 criterion require treatment : 1 . Evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development , worsen , anemia thrombocytopenia . 2 . Massive ( ie , least 6 cm leave costal margin ) , progressive , symptomatic splenomegaly . 3 . Massive node ( ie , least 10 cm long diameter ) , progressive , symptomatic lymphadenopathy . 4 . Progressive lymphocytosis increase 50 % 2month period lymphocyte double time ( LDT ) less 6 month ( may extrapolate ) . Lymphocyte double time obtain linear regression extrapolation ALCs obtain interval 2 week observation period 2 3 month . For patient initial blood lymphocyte count less 30 x 109/L ( 30,000/μL ) , LDT use single parameter define indication treatment . In addition , factor contribute lymphocytosis lymphadenopathy CLL ( eg , infection ) exclude . 5 . Constitutional symptom , define 1 follow diseaserelated symptom sign : Unintentional weight loss &gt; 10 % within previous 6 month prior screen Significant fatigue ( inability work perform usual activity ) Fevers high 38.0°C 2 week without evidence infection ; Night sweat 1 month without evidence infection Measurable nodal disease compute tomography ( CT ) . Measurable nodal disease define least one lymph node &gt; 1.5 cm long diameter site previously irradiate . An irradiated lesion may assess measurable disease document progression lesion since radiotherapy end . 5 . No prior treatment . 6 . Total CIRS &gt; 6 and/or creatinine clearance &lt; 70 ml/min [ CockcroftGault ] ) . 7 . Hematology value within follow limit : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1 x 109/L ( ie , ≥1000/μL ) independent growth factor support . Platelets ≥50,000/mm3 bone marrow involvement independent transfusion support 8 . Biochemical value within follow limit : 1 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 2 . Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN unless bilirubin rise due Gilbert 's syndrome nonhepatic origin 3 . Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( Cockroft Gault ) ≥40 mL/min 9 . Women childbearing potential men sexually active must practice highly effective method birth control study consistent local regulation regard use birth control method subject participate clinical trial . Men must agree donate sperm study . For female , restriction apply 1 month last dose study drug . For male , restriction apply 3 month last dose study drug . 10 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum ( betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ βhCG ] ) urine pregnancy test Screening . Women pregnant breastfeeding ineligible study . 11 . A signed ( sign legallyacceptable representative ) inform consent document indicate understand purpose procedure require study , include biomarkers , willing participate study . 1 . Any significant concurrent , uncontrolled medical condition organ system dysfunction and/or laboratory abnormality psychiatric disease , investigator 's opinion , could compromise subject 's safety , interfere absorption metabolism ibrutinib capsule , put study outcome undue risk prevent subject signing informed consent form . 2 . Pregnant lactating female 3 . Known presence alcohol and/or drug abuse . 4 . Any potential subject meet follow criterion exclude participate study . 5 . Major surgery within 4weeks randomization . 6 . Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia . 7 . Known central nervous system lymphoma . 8 . History stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 6 month prior randomization , significant cerebrovascular disease past 6 month ongoing event active symptom sequela . 9 . Requires anticoagulation warfarin equivalent vitamin K antagonist ( eg , phenprocoumon ) moment study . 10 . Requires treatment strong CYP3A inhibitor . 11 . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month Screening , Class 3 ( moderate ) Class 4 ( severe ) cardiac disease define New York Heart Association 12 . Vaccinated live , attenuated vaccine within 4 week randomization . 13 . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive serology HIV ; active Hepatitis B Virus infection positive serology Hepatitis B ( HBV ) define positive test HBsAg HBVDNA ; active Hepatitis C HCVRNA positive ; uncontrolled active systemic infection require intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral treatment , limited , chronic renal infection , chronic chest infection ; history tuberculosis within last five year recent exposure tuberculosis equal le 6 month . 14 . Richter 's syndrome ( RS ) , concomitant past malignancy . Subjects free malignancy least 5 year , history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer , successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible .</criteria>
