	<detailed_description>Chronic musculoskeletal pain complex medical condition . Patients often experience increased level pain-related distress , include anxiety , depression disability , impaired sleep , poor well-being diminish quality life . Over past decade , numerous study provide evidence existence attentional bias towards pain-related information chronic pain patient . A critical question remain unanswered whether pain-related bias simply epiphenomenon chronic pain , whether causal role maintenance pain . Recently , grow interest potential benefit attentional retrain individual various emotional disorder , focus upon attentional bias modification ( ABM ) . ABM theory-driven intervention use computer-based paradigm , typically visual-probe task , implicitly manipulate attention away source threat relevant individual 's fear concern . To date , three publish study use ABM chronic pain patient exist , combine result support therapeutic benefit ABM pain , pain-related distress disability . Considering encouraging result , important expand field research explore ABM chronic pain great depth . In particular , former study assess clinical effectiveness ABM laboratory environment . The purpose double-blind RCT study determine whether internet-delivered ABM therapeutic benefit patient chronic musculoskeletal pain pain pain-related distress , thereby assess train effect real-world setting . The visual-probe task use assessment modification pain-related attentional bias . This computerise paradigm record participant response time series visual stimulus . Following initial fixation point , trial present stimulus pair distinct location ( e.g . leave right initial fixation point ) , specify length time ( i.e. , 500 1250ms ) . Stimuli may consist word image , experimental trial feature one pain-related stimulus one neutral stimulus . Following , stimuli remove , visual probe replace one stimulus . Participants indicate location probe quickly accurately possible via manual response . Response time faster probe appear attended region screen unattended region , provide measure attentional allocation . Averaged response time calculate , convert index attentional bias . In standard control ( i.e. , placebo ) version visual probe task , probe replaces pain-related neutral stimulus equal number time , ABM version , probe always replace neutral stimulus thus train attention away pain-related stimulus . Dose effect explore study , participant randomise one four condition : ( ) 10-session Attentional Modification Group , ( ii ) 10-session Attentional Control Group , ( iii ) 18-session Attentional Modification Group , ( iv ) 18-session Attentional Control Group . The primary outcome measure pain intensity pain interference , secondary outcome measure include anxiety , depression , pain-related fear sleep impairment , include engagement satisfaction online visual-probe training task . It hypothesize participant receive ABM training show significantly great reduction pain pain-related distress compare participant receive placebo training . Dose effect investigate exploratory manner .</detailed_description>
