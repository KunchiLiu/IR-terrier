	<brief_title>Modulation Heme Oxygenase 1 Nizatidine Lisinopril Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapeutic option gastroparesis limit dietary modification pharmacological ( i.e. , prokinetic symptomatic ) agent . Exciting novel preliminary data program demonstrate ( ) reduce expression heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1 ) responsible loss interstitial cell Cajal delay gastric empty non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse , ( ii ) upregulation ( HO-1 ) reverse delayed gastric empty model , perhaps generate carbon monoxide ( CO ) , anti-apoptotic cytoprotective action , may relax smooth muscle , ( iii ) hemin upregulates HO-1 human . However , hemin exorbitant administer intravenously . A large throughput screen assay uncovered histamine H2 receptor antagonist nizatidine ACE inhibitor lisinopril upregulate HO-1 Human Embryonic Kidney ( HEK ) cell . Hence , double-blind placebo-controlled study randomly assign 24 healthy subject one 4 arm , HO-1 protein activity concentration assess .</detailed_description>
