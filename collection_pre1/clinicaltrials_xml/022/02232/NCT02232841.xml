	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate sensitivity specificity Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) bedside diagnostic tool lung pathology patient mechanically ventilate . In electrical impedance tomography low amplitude , low frequency current apply electrode , result voltage measure use computed electrical property interior chest change time . The computed property use form image , use monitoring diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study characterize ability electrical impedance tomography system ( hardware software ) distinguish lung pathology assess sensitivity specificity well overall agreement CT scan term spatial resolution . The study test , well refine , mathematical algorithm need create meaningful output adult patient receive mechanical ventilation also receive receive CT scan part standard care .</detailed_description>
