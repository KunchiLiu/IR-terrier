	<brief_title>Acupuncture Female IC/PBSyndrome Its Effect Urinary Microbiome : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Urinary Microbiota . Within internal surface , define exist outside body ( e.g . intestinal epithelium vaginal epithelium ) , exist commensal microbial community . These microbiota believe beneficial human health , facilitate efficient removal improperly function immune cell protect host pathogen infection13-15 . The human bladder core component human urinary tract . It hollow muscular organ line transitional epithelium , function storage site metabolic waste form urine . Given bladder 's luminal space also consider outside body , would seem reasonable urinary microbiota would present . Yet , historic dogma maintain urine `` sterile , '' base culture-dependent method bacterial detection . This paradigm shifting , however , base newly publish data note presence urinary microbiota adult woman without clinical urinary tract infections16,17 . Furthermore , recently discover microbiota woman overactive bladder ( specifically associate urgency incontinence ) distinguishable microbiota woman stress urinary incontinence . These finding suggest IC/PBS may influence alteration urinary microbiota . Indeed , recent evidence report difference urinary microbiome dominate Lactobacillus subject IC/PBS compare healthy controls18 . This work limit lack correlative clinical symptomatology , small sample size urinary sample may contaminate . The investigator long term goal determine pelvic pain mechanisms inform clinically-relevant classification evidence-based treatment woman IC/PBS CPP . The short term goal application determine safety , tolerability efficacy acupuncture woman IC/PBS neuromodulative treatment correlate urinary microbiome acupuncture responder . Our approach advance understanding contribution consequence peripheral pelvic nociception IC/PBS .</detailed_description>
