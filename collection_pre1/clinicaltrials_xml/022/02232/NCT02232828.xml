	<brief_summary>Background : For treat deep caries lesion , selective stepwise , i. e. one- two-step incomplete excavation seem advantageous compare complete caries removal . However , current evidence regard success , define require re-treatments , survival teeth different excavation insufficient definitive recommendation , especially treat deciduous teeth . Moreover , restoration integrity comparatively analyze longitudinally , neither patient ' , dentist ' parent ' preference clinical long-term cost emanate initial re-treatments report yet . Our primary hypothesis success rate differ significantly selectively stepwise excavate teeth . Secondary hypothesis restoration integrity assume significantly differ selectively stepwise excavate teeth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment deep caries lesion associate significant risk pulp , include pulpal exposure post-operative pulpal complication , might eventually compromise retention tooth [ 1 ] . Moreover , treat deep lesion might associate pain subjective burden treatment might generate long-term cost due re-treatments require [ 2 , 3 ] . For deciduous teeth , various treatment deep lesion describe : Complete excavation aim remove infect affected carious dentin , inherent risk pulpal exposure . In contrast , stepwise , i. e. two-step excavation leave carious dentin initial excavation step , seal residual caries temporary restoration , re-enters cavity second step eventually attempt complete excavation . This approach think facilitate arrest remineralization lesion induce development tertiary dentin , thereby reduce risk pulpal exposure post-operative complication second excavation step [ 4 , 5 ] . Since several study find seal residual lesion clinically microbiologically arrest , need re-enter increasingly question within last decade [ 6 ] . Selective , i. e. one-step incomplete partial excavation seal carious dentin definitive restoration , omit re-entry [ 7 ] . Sealing lesion think deprive residual bacteria dietary carbohydrate find exert significant antibacterial effect , thus arrest lesion [ 8 , 9 ] . However , doubt remain regard effect seal carious dentin long-term quality restoration [ 10 ] . Moreover , remain unknown patient prefer one treatment , might especially relevant treat child . Several study compare complete selective stepwise excavation deciduous teeth publish , one three-arm study compare selective stepwise excavation primary teeth ( Tab . 1 ) . In addition , none study assess patient- dentists-centered outcome , i. e. preference , analyze clinically assessed long-term cost emanate excavation . Objectives Hypotheses The study aim compare success , i. e. probability require re-interventions , survival , i. e. probability require tooth removal , selectively versus stepwise excavate vital , non-symptomatic deciduous molar deep lesion . In addition , assess restoration integrity selectively versus stepwise excavate deciduous molar , evaluate preference patient , parent dentists one strategy , comparatively assess cost associate strategy . Our primary hypothesis success rate differ significantly selectively stepwise excavate teeth . Secondary hypothesis restoration integrity assume significantly differ selectively stepwise excavate teeth . Moreover , hypothesize patient ' , parent ' dentist ' preference significantly different selective versus stepwise excavate teeth . Eventually , initial long-term cost excavation method suppose significantly differ . The plan study secondary care-based prospective , multi-center two-arm , parallel-group , randomize control trial three pediatric university dental clinic Germany . We plan enroll 300 patient one deeply carious , sensitive non-symptomatic deciduous molar . One molar per patient randomly allocate receive one two treatment ( selective stepwise excavation ) . Total follow-up time three year completion initial treatment . Success , survival restoration integrity assess one , two three year . Patients ' , parent ' dentist ' preference assess treatment use visual-analogue scale Likert-rating scale . Costs assess initial follow-up treatment base micro-costing approach .</detailed_description>
