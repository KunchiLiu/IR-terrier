	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safe effective combination study drug romidepsin lenalidomide treat patient peripheral t-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) previously treat cancer . Currently , standard treatment patient PTCL ; common treatment use combination drug call CHOP , difficult treatment tolerate side effect , particularly effective patient PTCL . Romidepsin ( Istodax® ) type drug call HDAC inhibitor . It interact DNA ( genetic material cell ) way stop tumor grow . It give infusion vein . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) type drug know immunomodulatory drug , IMID short . This drug affect tumor cell grow survive , include affect blood vessel growth tumor . It give oral tablet ( mouth ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy combination romidepsin plus lenalidomide patient previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety combination romidepsin lenalidomide . II . Further evaluate efficacy combination romidepsin lenalidomide . III . Evaluate delay cytotoxic chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate use Northwestern Medicine ( NM ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) v CT image PTCL . II . Validate new prognostic model newly diagnose PTCL . III . Investigate tumor immunohistochemical profile identify potential biomarkers associate prognosis treatment response . OUTLINE : Patients receive romidepsin intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression , inter-current illness prevents administration treatment , unacceptable toxicity , patient decides withdraw study treatment ( study whole ) , general specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment treat investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
