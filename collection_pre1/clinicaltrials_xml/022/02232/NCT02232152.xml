	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect best dose CPI-613 give together fluorouracil treat patient colorectal cancer spread part body remove surgery . CPI-613 may kill tumor cell turn mitochondrion . Mitochondria use tumor cell produce energy building block need make tumor cell . By shut mitochondrion , CPI-613 deprive tumor cell energy supply need survive grow body . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving CPI-613 fluorouracil may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 Fluorouracil Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CPI-613 ( 6,8-bis [ benzylthio ] octanoic acid ) , use combination 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) , patient non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer fail FOLFOX ( leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil oxaliplatin ) , FOLFIRI ( leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride ) , Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) wild type , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor-based regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , safety efficacy various dose CPI-613 , use combination 5-FU , patient non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid . Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-4 fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 2-4 . Courses repeat every 2 week 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
