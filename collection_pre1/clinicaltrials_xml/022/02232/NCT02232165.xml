	<brief_summary>Current guideline clinical management acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) recommend maintenance mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) 85 90 mmHg first seven day SCI clinical option . Unfortunately , medical evidence support recommendation exist clinical case series level ( Class III data ) . Furthermore , maintenance sustain systemic hypertension , per clinical guideline , may associate risk patient via adverse medical event . Given equivocal evidence , investigator group question merit sustain induced hypertension follow acute SCI previously conduct randomize , prospective control feasibility study examine issue . This prior pilot study randomize patient acute SCI spinal cord perfusion pressure ( SCPP = MAP - intrathecal pressure ( ITP ) ) target ≥ 75 mmHg control group ( hypotension avoidance , MAP ≥ 65 mmHg ) . The primary endpoint measure define change American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) motor score baseline . No difference primary outcome note one-year post-SCI study . In light pilot data , investigator hypothesize maintenance normotension ( MAP ≥ 65mmHg ) inferior induce hypertension ( MAP ≥ 85mmHg ) 7 day follow acute SCI . As , investigator propose conduct Phase III non-inferiority prospective , randomized clinical trial acute SCI patient . Subjects randomize one two MAP management group 7 day ; Group 1 manage target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg , Group 2 manage target MAP ≥ 85 mmHg . The primary endpoint change ASIA motor score baseline 12 month post injury . A difference ≤10 ASIA motor point change baseline group consider non-inferiority . Secondary endpoint include ASIA sensory score , proportion patient achieve one grade improvement ASIA impairment scale , quality life assessment ( measure Short-Form-36 [ SF-36 ] ) functional outcome ( measure Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM ) Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) . These measured baseline , 72 hour 3 , 6 12 month injury . Adverse event meticulously record . The information glean trial provide valuable information acute treatment traumatic SCI serve objective optimize current clinical practice thus maximize medical neurological outcome individual follow acute traumatic SCI .</brief_summary>
