	<brief_summary>Baseline level PAR-4 secrete normal cell generally inadequate cause massive apoptosis cancer cell drug bolster secretion PAR-4 would constitute important therapeutic advance.The apoptosis sensitize feature hydroxychloroquine enhance anti-tumor effect broad range cancer therapeutic . The investigator hypothesize hydroxychloroquine induce least 2-fold increase systemic ( plasma ) PAR-4 level compare pre-treatment plasma level patient resectable solid tumor .</brief_summary>
