	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction . Cancer prostate ( PCa ) currently lead newly diagnose cancer second common cause cancer death among men industrialize world . In Denmark alone 4000 men yearly diagnose PCa . As PCa primarily affect elderly patient , one assume PCa become one important medical issue develop world due already high incidence combine grow population elderly men . The aetiology disease well understood . In common form PCa evolve glandular tissue prostate . Metastatic spread commonly happen lymphogenous spread regional lymph node haematogenous spread red bone marrow . Intended curative treatment PCa associate considerable side effect , particular incontinence , impotence radiation damage surround tissue . Furthermore , 30 % patient organ-confined disease , treat radical prostatectomy , biochemical relapse within 10 year . Relapse may due local recurrent disease suggest poor surgical quality poor initial staging undetected metastasis time treatment . At diagnosis patient stratify low , intermediary high risk dissieminatio accord D'Amico . Patients intermediate high risk dissemination examine whole-body bone scintigraphy ( WBS ) pelvic lymph node dissection ( PLND ) . 2 . Background . 2.1 . Current staging limitation . WBS examination choice evaluation potential dissemination bone . WBS utilizes 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate ( 99mTc-MDP ) bind bone matrix form osteoblast . Gamma camera detect γ-radiation emit decay tracer thereby create 2-dimensional image depict local osteoblast activity . Several limitation apply use WBS staging patient PCa . Sensitivity report low 39 % lesion-based analysis patient low number lesion . This combine low sensitivity due many equivocal lesion cause bone pathology metastasis . Sensitivity specificity improve use single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , tracer WBS use generate three-dimensional image use rotate gamma camera . This method also give well anatomical information exact position potential metastasis . The examination choice evaluation potential metastasis lymph node extend PLND . This procedure do either prior radiotherapy prostatectomy patient intermediate high risk dissemination . The optimal extent dissection debate . The extended PLND perform institution include node obturator fossa , node external iliac artery vein , node around internal iliac artery node along common iliac artery cross ureter . This dissection assume include approximately 75 % lymph node know harbor primary prostatic lymph node metastasis . Extended PLND surgically demand risk lymphocele formation , infectious complication severe bleed due lymph node ' close proximity large vessel pelvis . All extend PLND perhaps best option lymph node stag PCa consider optimal due above-mentioned issue . 2.2 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . Positron Emission Tomography combine Computerized Tomography ( PET/CT ) well-established tool diagnose stag several type cancer . PET image technique pair gamma ray emit positron-emitting radionuclide tracer detect , produce three-dimensional image tracer concentration base amount gamma ray emit . The radioactive tracer couple biologically active molecule depend organ metabolic process interest . These image fuse CT create combine functional high-resolution anatomical image . Several tracer develop use cancer diagnostics stag . As , PET/CT generally accept role diagnose stag PCa neither Europe US . 2.2.1 Choline . Choline precursor phosphatidylcholine , phospholipid integrate cell membrane make marker cell membrane turnover metabolism . 11C-Choline first use PET tracer 1997 . Since many study perform 11C-Choline later 18F-Choline ( FCH ) approximately property 11C-Choline , long half-life ( 110 min vs. 20 min ) make versatile every-day use . A recent study department test use FCH-PET/CT detect lymph node metastasis 210 patient PCa . The study conclude FCH-PET/CT ideally suit lymph node staging could give additional information bone metastasis . Several investigator also imply , . A likely reason well detection metastasis bone bone metastasis early stage actually bone-marrow metastasis rather bone matrix metastasis likely bone-marrow metastasis proceed bone matrix metastasis . These detectable WBS ( probably CT MRI either ) . Larger prospective series use FCH-PET/CT image bone metastasis PCa-patients yet produce . 2.2.2 FDG . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) common PET-tracer use 95 % oncologic PET study . FDG metabolic tracer depict cellular glucose uptake , increase cancer , inflammation condition rapid cellular turnover . It trap inside cell depend presence activity enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase , appear decrease proportion aggressiveness individual malignancy . Increased cellular FDG accumulation , therefore , specific malignancy , time indicator degree malignancy , may cover entire spectrum range insignificant non-aggressive highly aggressive rapidly metastasize PCa FDG-PET image PCa intensively investigate , far without convince success . The reason several . Well-differentiated PCa 's utilizes less glucose tumor general thus may give rise result consider false negative . Moreover , since surplus radioactive FDG excrete kidney , intense accumulation ureteres urine bladder may hamper interpretation prostate gland nearby regional lymph node . However , necessarily mean FDG poor tracer image PCa . In fact , may useful one , consider several factor take account past . The traditional acquisition time point one hour administration tracer may ideal one . This time point entirely arbitrary . The increase FDG accumulation seem take place several hour administration malignant tissue , whereas FDG accumulation normal inflamed tissue may reach maximal uptake early time point . Thus , late imaging may result increase FDG accumulation decrease blood urine background , therefore , much good signal-to-noise ratio subsequently well result . A recent review use dual-point acquisition demonstrate increased specificity sensitivity detection several malignancy . The use dual time point FDG-PET/CT staging PCa investigate . 3 . Trial objective . To evaluate diagnostic value Dual time point-PET/CT detect bone lymph node metastases 30 patient newly diagnose PCa 4 . Method . Patients include study Choline PET/CT perfomed part another study . In addition dual time point FDG-PET/CT perform . The FDP-PET/CT perform acquisition 1 3 hour administration tracer . All scan perform random order within three week images interpret specialist nuclear medicine specialist radiology . Images interpret base visual evaluation supplementary measurement SUV . Activity lymph node record accord location - external iliac vein , obturator fossa internal iliac artery vein . During extended PLND tissue mention station remove place separate container mark follow - `` Iliaca externa dxt '' , `` Iliaca externa sin '' , `` Fossa obturatorius dxt '' , `` Fossa obturatorius sin '' , `` Iliaca interna dxt '' `` Iliaca interna sin '' Experts pathology examine tissue sample . Results PET/CT available pathologist .</detailed_description>
