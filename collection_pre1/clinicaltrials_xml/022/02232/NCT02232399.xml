	<brief_summary>The aim study assess ability Levosimendan reduce postoperative acute kidney injury pediatric patient undergo surgery congenital heart disease ( CHDs ) . Young child , age 1 12 month , congenital heart disease need elective heart surgery include study . The trial contain two study group , 35 patient . One group receive Levosimendan second group receive Milrinone heart muscle-strengthening agent operation . Milrinone currently use drug choice many pediatric cardiac surgery center . It remain see Levosimendan exert kidney protect function addition heart muscle-strengthening property . The primary objective study investigate preventive effect Levosimendan postoperative acute kidney injury pediatric patient undergo surgery CHDs . Creatinine level postoperatively primary endpoint . Creatinine , common marker kidney injury , measure daily . The treatment Levosimendan Milrinone start operation ( initiation cardiopulmonary bypass ) last 24 hour . Blood sample obtain six occasion perioperatively . Patients follow 4 day termination treatment ( totally 5 day ) . The duration study 30 day ( 24 hour treatment + 4 day follow + 30-days-mortality registration ) . Creatinine primary outcome study . Inflammatory biomarkers relevant biomarkers comprise secondary outcome variable .</brief_summary>

Use nephrotoxic drug ( like ibuprofen , angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor , gentamicin , vancomycin ) preoperative postoperative first post operative day . Contrast agent whithin 24 hour operation . 8 . Use inhibitor membrane transport protein ( cimetidine , cetirizine , trimethoprim , probenecid , rifampin gemfibrosil ) . 9 . Allergy Levosimendan substance include preparation previous use Levosimendan . 10 . Severe arrhythmias need pacemaker treatment prior operation 11 . Severe cardiac dysfunction need treatment extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) prior operation . 12 . Preoperative need mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic agent . 13 . Reoperation ( open heart surgery ) . Earlier surgical closure arterial duct count exclusion criterion . 14 . Prematurity : Gestational age &lt; 30 week , irrespective postpartum age .
