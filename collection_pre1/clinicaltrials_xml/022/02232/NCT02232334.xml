	<brief_summary>Global osteopathic manual treatment decrease severity score Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index tool patient idiopathic gastroparesis . In longitudinal controlled pre-test post-test group design , subject idiopathic gastroparesis ( IG ) utilize see global osteopathic manual treatment decrease symptom . Patients IG suffer vary degree nausea , vomit abdominal pain secondary delay gastric emptying . There know cause people suffer IG . According power analysis , population utilized experiment group control group . The measure tool use Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index ( GCSI ) widely use symptom score questionnaire gastroparesis . The subject population fill GCSI initially two ( 2 ) week period measure symptom control period . The subject treat global osteopathic manual treatment one ( 1 ) treatment every two ( 2 ) week four ( 4 ) week ( day 1 , 14 , 28 ) . The GCSI fill day first ( 1st ) treatment ( last day control period ) two ( 2 ) week last treatment ( day 42 ) . In order reject null hypothesis , p value &lt; 0.05 power 0.8 , minimum ten ( 10 ) subject treatment group require treatment effect 1 . A 'Treatment effect 1 ' define Cohen 's , = mean difference/standard deviation . It expect result show improvement symptom data collect GCSI questionnaire treatment group . The result study could significant contribute osteopathic community validate effectiveness traditional osteopathic manual therapy well give non-invasive option people suffer disease since struggle minimal treatment option -- medicine significant side effect , full total stomach removal gastric electrical stimulator implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroparesis disorder present delay gastric emptying , abdominal pain , nausea , vomit . This condition find people complication diabetes-neuropathy vagus nerve gastric surgery-damage vagus nerve . With idiopathic gastroparesis ( IG ) , cause poorly understood theory suggest viral infection affect gut motility , pyloric valve spasm well damage specialized cell within wall stomach . Unfortunately treatment option minimal people suffer gastroparesis regardless type . It action food propulsion poorly understood regard IG - specifically smooth muscle , autonomic enteric nerve specialize cell gut name Interstitial Cells Cajal ( ICC ) . ICC pacemaker cell gut conduct motility . The objective study normalize structural abnormality patient idiopathic gastroparesis global osteopathic manual treatment , use quantitative research method longitudinal control pre-test post-test design . The principal investigator ( PI ) , background emergency medicine register nurse , see patient emergency department suffer idiopathic gastroparesis . The acute attack appear intense debilitate often require anti-nausea , pain anti-anxiety medication . As osteopathic student , PI would often wonder could achieve osteopathic manual treatment ( OMT ) help people emergency department suffering symptom . Current treatment available people suffer gastroparesis limit . In article , Gastroparesis - Current Concepts Considerations ( 2008 ) , Dr. Hasler , summarize research different treatment option gastroparesis . There several medication available gastroparesis however discuss Dr. Hasler , side effect medication significant . There invasive treatment , injection botulinum toxin pyloric sphincter , gastric electrical stimulator gastric resection show improvement symptom carry heavy risk utilized . The research method use determine global osteopathic manual treatment help patient suffer idiopathic gastroparesis longitudinal pre-test post-test control quantitative study . The tool use measure data Gastroparesis Cardinal Index Score ( GCSI ) , create Janssen Global Services , LLC . The GCSI reliable validated tool rating symptom intensity fullness-early satiety , nausea-vomiting , bloat . The validation tool test 169 subject fill GCSI result compare clinician symptom rating . Total score GCSI `` responsive change overall gastroparesis symptom assess clinician ( P = 0.0002 ) patient ( P = 0.002 ) . A minimum ten ( 10 ) subject require population accord power analysis , lease twelve ( 12 ) subject enrol account potential 20 % drop rate . However , ( 20 ) twenty subject goal recruitment study . Approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) acquire Aspire-IRB , gastroenterologists family medicine physician Sonoma County Santa Rosa California area give recruitment letter consent form study information give patient qualify study . Flyers distribute throughout community ( grocery store , community center , pharmacy etc. ) . Social medium might utilize acquire subject appear strong presence support group online people gastroparesis . The entire population , control group period , fill GCSI initially two ( 2 ) week . Those subject transition experimental group period study-the GCSI fill last day control period use first day treatment GCSI result . IN experiment period : subject receive three ( 3 ) separate global osteopathic manual treatment four ( 4 ) week ( day 1 , 14 , 28 ) . Two week third ( 3rd ) treatment ( day 42 ) , subject fill GCSI final time . The subject wait two ( 2 ) week allow full integration last treatment GCSI design record prior two ( 2 ) week patient symptom . The subject population screen via email telephone assure meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Once consent , participant instruct fill first ( 1st ) GCSI questionnaires email complete form back PI . The data first GCSI completion establishes day one ( 1 ) two ( 2 ) week control period . During two ( 2 ) week control period , subject continue regular treatment IG ( dietary , medicine ) . They obtain new therapy massage , acupuncture , osteopathy start new conventional medical treatment . If acute attack require emergency room visit , subject exclude study . At end two ( 2 ) week period , subject fill GCSI result anonymously stored future data analysis . The subject transition experimental period assign first treatment . The last day control period start experimental period . All treatment occur office/clinic PI Santa Rosa California , USA . The PI work massage practitioner license malpractice insurance Associated Bodywork Massage Professionals ( ABMP ) well Manual Therapy Insurance Plus Barral Institute . Both institution cover general professional liability massage therapy well various form manual therapy . At first treatment , day one ( 1 ) experimental period , GCSI ( Appendix A ) health history questionnaire ( Appendix I ) complete . An anamnesis take subject assess treated global osteopathic manual treatment treat lesion find assessment . The data GCSI collect store anonymously data analysis . The lesion find assessment technique use treat store use discussion appropriate . The process repeat two ( 2 ) week four ( 4 ) week first ( 1st ) visit participant except without GCSI without health questionnaire require first visit . Each treatment last ninety ( 90 ) minute . To keep result consistent possible , subject see time day treatment . The result two ( 2 ) week four ( 4 ) week store possible discussion . To allow time integration treatment participant fill GCSI two ( 2 ) week fourth ( 4th ) week experimental period . The data GCSI tool fill control experimental period send PI via email data analysis .</detailed_description>
