	<brief_summary>It find arm leg cycle similar walking term muscle activation pattern joint range motion . In addition , arm leg cycle walk activate similar neural pathway . Another advantage arm leg cycle involves coordination four limb rhythmic movement . This may particularly beneficial give previous finding arm movement contributes activation leg muscle walk human . This achieve interconnected neural pathway link arm leg . These neural interlimb connection remain intact stroke victim , maximize contribution arm legs may increase coordination walk . Thus , objective research determine arm leg cycling use increase strength interlimb connection help improve walk ability post-stroke population . It hypothesize arm leg cycling transfer improvement walk post stroke population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arm Leg Cycling Exercise After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For suffered stroke , damage brain result decrease ability walk , thus decrease quality life significant way . Traditionally , body weight support treadmill train use walk rehabilitation ; however , therapy require specialized technician , equipment , facility . Arm leg cycle ergometer , device commonly find gym , could provide inexpensive readily accessible mean walk rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
