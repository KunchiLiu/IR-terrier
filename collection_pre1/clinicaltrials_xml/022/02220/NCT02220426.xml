	<brief_summary>The primary goal study evaluate feasibility detect Brown Adipose Tissue ( BAT ) healthy subject use hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI . In pilot study , MRI BAT healthy adult volunteer perform 3 Tesla ass image quality use prototype surface coil pulse sequence follow inhalation hyperpolarized 129Xe ( xenon ) gas thermoneutrality mild cold condition . The investigator test ability xenon MRI see brown adipose tissue detect thermogenic activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In fight obesity , brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) consider new target . The hypothesis tissue partially responsible imbalance energy intake energy expenditure keep lean people lean obese people obese . As detection tissue adult human difficult , study aim evaluate use hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI detection tissue . Hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI currently use lung ventilation study . For study subject undergo MRI scan also inhale hyperpolarized xenon . Scans do stimulation thermogenic activity cold exposure , MR image spectra acquire supraclavicular area . We expect inhale gas diffuse blood eventually reach BAT manner proportional metabolic activity tissue . Objectives study : - To detect BAT volume use hyperpolarized xenon MRI - To detect BAT thermogenic activity hyperpolarized xenon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy</detailed_description>
