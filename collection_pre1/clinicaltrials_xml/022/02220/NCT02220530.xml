	<brief_title>Sedation Effect Global Quality Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent decade notable increase use range gastrointestinal endoscopy procedure - colonoscopy particularly - , recent year implementation colorectal cancer screen program . Colonoscopy cause discomfort even pain . In order reduce effect facilitate procedure , patient usually administer iv sedation . Numerous study assess impact sedation patient discomfort anxiety , undesirable effect colonoscopy , even certain aspect relate scientific technical quality . There , however , study evaluate effect sedation overall quality procedure . The overall quality every medical act define accord four dimension : accessibility , easily patient obtain assistance require without physical bureaucratic barrier ; scientific technical quality , provision best possible assistance up-to-date knowledge technical resource ; perceive quality , patient 's degree satisfaction care provide ; safety , absence undesirable side effect . Doctors typically assessed quality procedure base scientific technical quality safety . The investigator strive conduct good , complication-free technique base cutting-edge scientific knowledge , often overlooked dimension . This study aim assess impact use sedation overall quality colonoscopy , therefore address every one dimension , namely : scientific technical quality , perceive quality safety . Since sedation procedure impact accessibility , study assess dimension . Subjects Methods : Prospective case-control study . The study include consecutive ambulatory patient refer Endoscopy Unit first-time colonoscopy . Patients exclude previous colonoscopy , anesthetic risk ASA III ( American Society Anesthesia classification ) allergy drug use undergoing antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy contraindicate procedure , pregnant woman patient unable understand questionnaire . Prior inclusion demographic data , clinical background indication colonoscopy collect patient . Thereafter patient randomly assign colonoscopy without sedation conscious sedation iv midazolam fentanyl dose accord age , weight baseline condition . The procedure conduct four endoscopists ample experience endoscopy sedation ( 7000 colonoscopy ) . 1 . Data collect endoscopy include : 1 . The degree cleanliness colon accord Boston scale ; define adequate preparation least 2 point region colon ) ; 2 . Whether colonoscopy complete cecum ; 3 . Time need insertion cecum withdrawal ; 4 . The complication might arise procedure recovery period ( early complication ) . To end , patient ' oxygen saturation heart rate continuously monitor begin procedure discharge blood pressure take every 5 minute . Non-sedated patient discharge Unit immediately procedure , sedate patient reach score 9 10 Aldrete scale . 5 . Adenomas resect , base pathology report . All biopsy examine pathologist specialized gastrointestinal pathology . 2 . Thirty day Endoscopy , patient interview telephone staff involvement study ( call center ) ask respond two questionnaire . 1 . The ASGE ( American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ) endoscopy satisfaction survey ( GHAA 9-me ) , previously translate Spanish validate team . 2 . A survey complication suffer 30 day follow procedure ( late complication ) , previously use early study . 3 . Assessment quality criterion : 1 . Six indicator use assess scientific technical quality procedure . The first three assess technical aspect : percentage colonoscopy complete cecum ; time require reach cecum ; withdrawal time . The remain three result indicator : percentage patient adenomas ; total number adenoma per patient ; total number advance adenoma . These indicator previously validate setting . Since use sedation procedure affect cleanliness colon , indicator use control variable . 2 . Perceived quality assess use ASGE ( American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ) satisfaction survey , previously translate Spanish adapt validate . Total score , score procedure ( item 7 survey ) number patient rating procedure `` excellent '' analyze . 3 . Safety assess follow method use previous research , analyze early complication ( occur procedure recovery phase ) late complication ( occur 30 day procedure ) . Statistical Analyses : Results express mean Â± standard deviation . Comparisons group perform use Chi-squared test ordinal variable Student 's t-test quantitative variable . Results p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Logistic regression use determine impact sedation quality indicator study .</detailed_description>
