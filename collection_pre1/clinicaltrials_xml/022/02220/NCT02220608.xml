	<brief_title>Phase I Study Bortezomib With G-CSF Stem Cell Mobilization Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose phase I study define maximum tolerate dose bortezomib mobilization effect give G-CSF stem cell mobilization multiple myeloma patient . We hypothesize bortezomib , addition increase number mobilize stem cell , optimize final apheresis product decrease myeloma cell contamination . Therefore , multiple myeloma patient rather multiple myeloma patient G-CSF mobilization failure target study .</detailed_description>
