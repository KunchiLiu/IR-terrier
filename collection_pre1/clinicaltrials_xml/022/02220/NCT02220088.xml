	<detailed_description>Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) consider gold standard treat intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . However , intermediate-stage HCC include heterogeneous population patient vary tumour burden , liver function ( Child-Pugh A B ) disease aetiology.This suggest patient intermediate-stage HCC derive similar benefit TACE , patient may benefit treatment option . Repetition TACE base evidence suggest one cycle TACE may sufficient effective treatment intermediate-stage HCC repeat TACE prolongs survival.However , intermediate-stage HCC patient often unsatisfactory clinical outcome repeat TACE sufficiently address exist guideline include criterion repeat TACE recommendation number TACE cycle repeat switch another treatment.The study , recently publish journal Hepatology show ART score &gt; =2.5 prior second TACE identifies patient dismal prognosis may profit TACE sessions.In clinical practice，however , also find patient show TACE-resistant beginning treatment may access get objective response retreatment TACE.So conduct prospective , randomize control study find whether patient show TACE-resistant obtain survival benefit retreatment TACE .</detailed_description>
