	<brief_summary>Within prospective , randomise , control study 60 , select patient chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) stroke traumatic brain injury randomise 30 1-hour session competitive versus non-competitive attentional training . Competitive training include fifteen 1-hour session standard ( paper pencil ) training competitive situation fifteen 1-hour session competitive attentional game design purpose use new virtual reality system ( conventional liquid-crystal-display screen infrared LED array facilitate multi-touch experience embed conventional table ) . Progress evaluate pre post measurement attentional neuropsychological test , subjective report global attention , usability motivational scale . Our hypothesis competitive training effective improve attention conventional training chronic phase acquire brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Attentional Process Training Using Competitive Versus Non Competitive Strategies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Sixty 18-75 years-old patient acquire brain injury , randomly assign 30 session competitive versus non-competitive cognitive attentional training ( see inclusion-exclusion criterion ) . Material Methods : Randomized clinical trial compare two different attentional training strategy . Attentional measure , usability data caregiver/family perception change , compare completing condition . Competitive train include new computer base train program involve use attentional skill different competitive scenario . Attentional exercise design accord instruction two expert neuropsychologists include game-based situation simulate different olympic disciplines.Neuropsychological protocol : An assessment begin intervention pos-treatment do train blinded neuropsychologist use measure selective , sustain , divide alternate attention ( see primary outcome measure ) . Usability Motivation : It well-known game-based cognitive exercise increase motivation treatment turn increase learn strategy improve outcome rehabilitation process . Competitive task also improve effort interest player intensity task increase motivation win , get reward beat others . Since motivation important element research , assess capacity end treatment Intrinsic Motivation Scale . Also , revise Competitiveness Index use measure subject 's preference competitive situation . Finally , usability consider secondary outcome study since game employ design play new virtual reality system build facilitate competitive strategy among 2-4 player ( see secondary outcome ) . Sample Size Calculation : There previous study use design propose investigation . Considering reduction big 20 % Hit-Reaction Time CPT-II score active group intervention , sample size group 27 participant standard-deviation magnitude half medium score group ( moderate variability ) , study able detect moderate effect size ( ES = 0,4 ) . Calculating sample loss 10 % group , define sample size per group 30 individual . Statistical method Statistical analysis perform Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) 12.0 . The univariate analysis perform student test / Mann-Whitney continuous variable Chi-Square test ( XÂ² ) / Fischer test categorical variable . The effective intervention time assess analysis mixed model ( repeat measure ANOVA ) .</detailed_description>
