	<brief_title>Whole Brain Radiotherapy Versus Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II prospective clinical trial . Pre treatment evaluation include estimation life expectancy , Creatinine ( GFR ) MRI brain contrast . An assessment cognitive function use Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire , assessment daily living activity use Modified Barthel 's index quality life assessment use EORTC QLQ-PAL-15 &amp; BN-20 questionnaire perform clinic . Karnofsky Performance Status also assess clinician . If assessment within eligibility criterion patient recruit . Before treatment begin history document baseline symptom use NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.0 neurological examination document baseline deficit must obtain . If patient randomized standard treatment whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) subject non-contrast CT scan use slice thickness 2.5 mm less plan radiotherapy . If patient randomize single fraction radiotherapy contrast CT use aid identify metastatic tumour within brain . Also single fraction arm contrast-enhanced diagnostic MRI obtain ≤ 10 day CT planning scan , single-plane high-resolution sequence low-resolution sequence two plane , use treatment planning . If contrast-enhanced diagnostic MRI obtain &gt; 10 day CT plan scan diagnostic MRI , subject require gadolinium-enhanced , high-resolution MRI sequence fusion treatment planning system . During treatment , patient daily online cone beam CT scan apply setup correction ensure treatment accuracy . To ensure minimal movement radiotherapy subject immobilize lie back plastic headshell integrate bite block . For subject single-fraction arm requiring steroid radiotherapy , dexamethasone 8 mg 1 hour radiotherapy 5 day afterwards require . For subject single-fraction arm requiring corticosteroid symptom management radiotherapy , dexamethasone 8 mg treatment 8 mg 2 time daily 2 day require . Beginning three day radiotherapy , taper back pre-radiotherapy dose do swiftly 4-6 day . However , subject dexamethasone 2 week time point , slow taper pre-radiotherapy dose use decrement 0.5 - 2 mg every 3-5 day use prevent hypocortisolemia . For subject 5-fraction arm , corticosteroid prescribe accord preference treating radiation oncologist . Anti-sickness medication steroid prescribe required fraction arm . Following therapy completion , patient see 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . At visit history neurological examination perform . Cognitive Function , Karnofsky Performance Status , Quality life Adverse Events assess record . Activities Daily Living steroid use assess telephone consultation every 4 week ( monthly ) 1 year . Steroid use confirm evaluate pharmacy prescription database . Patients contrast-enhanced MRI brain every time point creatinine 1 week MRI ensure safety intravenous contrast administration . Steroid use record patient diary first 6 week post treatment monthly telephone discussion .</detailed_description>
