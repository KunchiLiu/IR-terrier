	<brief_summary>VELCADE demonstrate marked activity haematological cancer lead registration ( MM , MCL ) . Currently biweekly weekly regimen explore . Key signal pathway aberrant haematological cancer also present solid tumor . VELCADE cover broad spectrum protein , pivotal carcinogenesis.VELCADE single agent &amp; combination chemotherapy solid cancer show modest real anti-tumor activity insufficient Phase III development . VELCADE PK exposure may inadequate solid tumor compare `` liquid cancer . '' VELCADE daily low dose administration may allow great PK exposure achieve , tolerated Hypotheses : VELCADE daily dose ( 5-days , 2-days ) tolerable biologically active dos VELCADE daily dose ( 5-days , 2-days ) result increase PK ( AUC ) /PD ( 20S proteasome inhibition ) VELCADE daily dosing ( 5-days , 2-days ) increase PK/PD result improve anti-tumor activity ( Increased tolerable VELCADE AUC may potentially cross threshold require clinically significant anti-tumor activity solid cancer ) . Some preclinical data suggest : VELCADE daily dose result increase proteasome inhibition tumor tissue Combination VELCADE + XRT/other daily dose agent may increase anti-tumor activity compare monotherapy alone .</brief_summary>

A tumor paraffin tissue block 2030 unstained slide tumor tissue block enough slide FNA allow biomarker predictive marker analysis . ( This biopsy need obtain fresh time screen . Obtaining unstained slide original diagnostic biopsy suffice meet requirement ) . Measurable evaluable disease Prior anticancer treatment permit ( i.e . chemotherapy , radiotherapy , hormonal , immunotherapy ) follow exception : Toxicity relate prior therapy must either resolve , return baseline deem irreversible conflict exclusion criterion .
