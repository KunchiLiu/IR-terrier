	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate proportion obese woman self-reported delay lactogenesis II ( `` breastmilk come '' ) compare woman normal weight . We hypothesize obese woman absolute 20 % increase delay lactogenesis II . We compare two group woman delay lactogenesis II , one group obese woman ( BMI &gt; 30 ) one group woman normal weight ( BMI &lt; 30 ) . The secondary objective ass factor influence self-reported delay lactogenesis II .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Lactogenesis II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lactogenesis I occur pregnancy ( midpregnancy beyond ) , mammary gland become sufficiently differentiate secrete small quantity specific milk component . Lactogenesis II define onset plentiful milk secretion typically occur 30-40 hour post delivery . It typically describe woman sense fullness leakage milk subjectively report 50-73 hour post delivery . The incidence delay lactogenesis II range 17-44 % . The risk neonatal weight loss 7 time great exclusively breastfed infant woman experience delay lactogenesis II compare woman experience typical onset lactogenesisII . In qualitative study 114 lactate woman , increase BMI significantly associate maternal perception delay onset lactogenesis II . The United States Breastfeeding Committee support exclusive breastfeeding first 6 month life `` may exert small positive influence reduce risk obesity childhood later life… '' Breastfeeding also associate decreased risk maternal morbidity type 2 diabetes , subclinical cardiovascular disease less abdominal visceral adiposity . Given prolong breastfeed improves overall health mother infant dyad , critical obtain good understand factor predictive successful breastfeeding outcome . At University South Florida clinic serve ethnically diverse population would benefit directed effort improve breastfeeding . Before undertake plan need assess contemporary factor impact lactogenesis . We plan prospectively enroll 186 pregnant woman protocol examine factor associate delayed lactogenesis . Ninety-three woman BMI 30 high time delivery 93 woman BMI ≤ 29 time delivery .</detailed_description>
