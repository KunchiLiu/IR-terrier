	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effects Single Ascending Doses ( SAD ) ASP8477 , Effect That Food Has Drug , Interaction Between ASP8477 Omeprazole Healthy Postmenopausal Females Healthy Young Vasectomized Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part I ( SAD ) healthy postmenopausal female evaluate safety , tolerability , define Maximum Tolerated Dose = MTD , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics single ascend oral dos ( SAD ) ASP8477 . It anticipate around 7 dos require cover range safe start dose MTD . Study medication administer fasted condition . Based safety , PK , clinical observation subject , dose escalation scheme may adapt . Escalation next dose proceeds review safety , tolerability , PK previous treatment period . Part II ( SAD young , healthy , vasectomized male ) similar Part I , one cohort 12 subject treat two dos ASP8477 plus placebo . The dos test depend safety data pharmacodynamic profile obtain Part I , expect exceed MTD . The rationale part bridge data obtain female subject male subject . Part III ( food effect ) postmenopausal female receive ASP8477 fast fed condition two separate period random order . The dose exceed 1/3 MTD , reach , 1/3 high test dose Part I . Subjects stay clinic 2 period 5 7 day ( depend terminal half life , result Part I ) . Subjects admit Day -2 per treatment period . Subjects ' feeding status Day 1 treatment period . Subjects give single dose ASP8477 feed fasting condition Day 1 . After final discharge , subject return End Study Visit ( ESV ) 5-9 day later . Part IV ( ASP8477-omeprazole drug-drug interaction ) postmenopausal subject randomize receive omeprazole alone ASP8477 two separate period ( random order ) . The dose ASP8477 MTD , reach , high test dose Part I. Omeprazole chosen target drug model substrate CYP2C19 ( accepted FDA ) ASP8477 know strong inhibitory effect CYP2C19 . Subjects admit Day -1 stay 2 period 4 day . Subjects give single dose omeprazole alone ASP8477 ( randomize order ) Day 1 . Study medication administer fasted condition . Subjects discharge Day 3 return ESV 5-9 day later .</detailed_description>
