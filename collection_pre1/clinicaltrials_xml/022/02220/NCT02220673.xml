	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To investigate safety local tolerability increase cumulative dos ( 2 , 4 , 6 actuation ) low ( 0.1 % ) high ( 0.5 % ) concentration BHT administer via oral inhalation Respimat® inhaler B ( RMT-B ) vs. 2 inhalation solution without BHT ( placebo BHT give RMT B placebo give hydroxylfluoralkane meter dose inhaler ( HFA MDI ) ) . In first step , trial perform healthy subject - safety concern arise - second step patient mild asthma sensitive metacholine respective challenge test . Secondary objective : To explore pharmacokinetics ( PK ) BHT .</brief_summary>
