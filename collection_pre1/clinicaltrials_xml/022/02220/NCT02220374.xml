	<brief_summary>Oesteoarthritis joint finger ( ) common problem . The first-line treatment involve pain killer take either tablet , gel , patch . Secondly , joint amenable injection steroid anaesthetic agent . Finally , last resort , joint may fuse replace prosthetic joint Hand Surgeons . We investigate whether supportive tap painful finger joint reduces pain improves function , whether treatment could use substitute pain killer , injection surgery . We hypothesise supportive finger tape may improve pain , improve stability joint thereby improve day-to-day hand function . We investigate two-group parallel randomise controlled trial whereby one group receive treatment tap group receive theoretically placebo tap configuration . We measure pain daily , hand function adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RCT Supportive Finger Tape PIPJ Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) interphalangeal joint hand common age-related joint disorder worldwide , affect hand ( ) 67 % elderly population . At least 18.2 % patient OA least one proximal interphalangeal joint involve second lead cause hand pain osteoarthritis thumb carpometacarpal joint . In UK , 3 % population seek medical attention symptom hand arthritis , main complaint pain , reduce grip strength , functional limitation day-today activity ( eg . dressing , eat drinking , take medication , write , etc ) , stiffness deformity . Currently , treatment osteoarthritis finger joint limit four different avenue carry limitation ( ) potential complication . Firstly , conservative measure physiotherapy without splint compression garment , alteration execution daily activity avoidance environmental trigger ( eg . cold wet weather ) - carry substantial time commitment interference normal life . Secondly , analgesic either oral , transcutaneous topical route may use - medication may cause drowsiness , confusion , constipation , collapse , kidney injury , stomach ulcer bleeding , well undesirable effect may in-turn precipitate life-threatening illness . Thirdly , joint may inject steroid anaesthetic agent diagnostic therapeutic - however , carry risk septic arthritis , tendon attrition paradoxical exacerbation symptom . Finally , surgery may offer either replace joint prosthesis fuse metal screw ( ) wire ( ) - surgery carry significant risk infection damage vessel nerve , may render finger useless even lead amputation . With current available treatment carry significant limitation , conceptualise treatment confers minimal ( proven ) risk may benefit individual base current theorised treatment supportive taping . The Kinesio® tap system well-known product use many athlete support joint improve performance . The elasticated latex tape apply skin overlie joint , specific orientation order provide theoretical benefit include : physical support misalign joint , increase recoil joint back anatomical position , reduce swell improve lymphatic flow . A recent systematic review conclude significant benefit Kinesio® tap reduce pain large joint ( eg . shoulder , knee ankle ) . The reason well understood may relate stimulation cutaneous peri-articular mechanoreceptors , physically re-aligned/support joint surface placebo effect . At present , Kinesio® system ideal patient finger joint osteoarthritis two reason - commercially available tape small enough apply finger latex component may prevent patient use . However , latex free substitute readily available hospital setting , similar property ( ie . adhesive elasticated ) safe cheap - Suture Strips® Derma Sciences™ . Research normal healthy subject show supportive tap finger improve perceived grip strength . Further , patient injured finger , supportive tap increase actual grip strength particular positions/actions . We know patient painful thumb joint benefit supportive tap improves joint alignment therefore function . However , to-date study role finger PIPIJ tap reduce pain arthritis . We hypothesise transfer proven benefit supportive tap bodily region ( ie . pain reduction , improve joint alignment , mechanical support well undefined benefit ) patient may benefit supportive tap PIPJ finger . Rationale : The current treatment modality finger joint arthritis carry significant risk undesirable potentially dangerous complication . We propose simple method supportive taping may improve patient 's pain function , within confer risk adverse event . Aims : We aim investigate effectiveness supportive tape perceive pain PIPJ osteoarthritis single digit one hand . We also aim investigate impact hand function undertake economic analysis comparison current available treatment . Type study : A pragmatic block two-group parallel randomise placebo control trial . Research question : Primary research question ; 1 . Does supportive tap PIPJ finger effect perceive pain Secondary research question : 1 . Does supportive tap PIPJ finger effect functional capability 2 . Does supportive tap PIPJ finger effect significant adverse undesirable effect 3 . Does supportive tap PIPJ finger effect represent economically feasible alternative current therapy 4 . Does placebo tap PIPJ finger effect patient report pain 5 . Does placebo tap PIPJ finger effect objective hand function</detailed_description>
