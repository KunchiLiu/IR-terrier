	<brief_summary>Thymic tumor rare tumor , represent common tumor anterior mediastinum . Thymoma indolent course advance disease propensity spread pleura . In first line therapy , combination chemotherapy produce response approximately 80 % patient . A number single agent activity recurrent disease , none curable . Patients recurrent thymoma limit treatment option , thus novel target modality need . At Indiana University Simon Cancer Center ( IUSCC ) , patient advance thymoma see institution country . Our main hypothesis PI3K pathway important driver growth metastasis thymoma inhibition PI3K pathway expect produce clinically meaningful response patient recurrent thymoma .</brief_summary>

Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Oral contraception , inject implanted hormonal method allow BKM120 potentially decrease effectiveness hormonal contraceptive . Fertile male , define male physiologically capable conceive offspring must use condoms treatment , 4 week ( 5 T1/2 ) stop treatment additional 12 week ( 1616 week total study drug discontinuation ) father child period . Female partner male study subject use highly effective contraception dose study agent 16 week final dose study therapy . 24 . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection 25 .
