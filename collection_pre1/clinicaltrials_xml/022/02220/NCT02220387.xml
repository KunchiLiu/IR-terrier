	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate molecular , cytological genetic feature occupational chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) condition different occupational exposure . In order achieve goal serum pro-inflammatory cytokine standard inflammation marker level , hemostasis , cytological analysis bronchoalveolar lavage association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) rs1800470 transform grow factor β1 ( TGF β1 ) gene , rs1828591 hedgehog interact protein ( HHIP ) gene , rs4129267 interleukin 6 receptor ( IL-6R ) gene , rs1051730 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3 ( CHRNA3 ) gene COPD subject expose silica dust expose polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhaust investigate . The relationship genotype phenotype characteristic , inflammation activity , assess C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF α ) serum concentration , different occupational COPD group study . The hypothesis mechanism underlie disease development progression different due environmental risk factor reflex differs disease attribute - molecular biomarkers , cytology result genetic susceptibility COPD due dust , COPD due chemical COPD smoker therefore COPD subdivide ecological phenotype accord environmental risk factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study rationale : The main risk factor COPD tobacco smoking , biomass smoking occupational factor . Tobacco smoke well-known risk factor tobacco induce COPD completely establish . Nevertheless mean occupational factor less famous equally important . Based comprehensive literature review American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) endorse notion strong evidence implicates occupational factor cause COPD [ Eisner MD et al. , 2010 ] . Occupational COPD take 19.2 % COPD patient 31.1 % never smoker result NHANESIII study [ Hnizdo E. et al. , 2004 ] . A considerable number work-related factor evidence causal association COPD include ( course limit ) silica silicates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon . Individuals variety occupation industry coal miner , coke worker , tunnel worker , metallurgist , weld worker , transportation worker , builder , farmer expose factor cite . Despite clinical pathophysiological feature COPD cause occupational factor still unclear . Occupational factor lead airflow limitation various entity - vapor , dust , gas fume different physical , chemical , biological feature , mechanism underlie disease development progression may different attributable risk factor . An environmental risk factor exposure well tobacco smoke result COPD part subject indicate significant genome gene environmental interaction role . COPD develop predisposed subject undergoing risk factor exposure . Therefore risk COPD individual depend genetic environment . There data concern effect genetic COPD risk specific subgroup - people expose occupational risk factor relate certain environmental factor . Statistical analysis : Statistical analysis carry Statistica 9.0 software . Significance level consider p = 0.05 . The qualitative variable express count percentage . The quantitative continuous variable express mean standard error mean ( M ± ) variables meet criterion normality minimum maximum , median meet criterion normality . Kruskal-Wallis test use compare multiply independent sample Mann-Whitney U test compare two independent sample variable consideration continuous measure ordinal scale . For comparison proportion , Chi-square use . For association assessment logistic regression method use . The odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate professional group . Multiple regression model use explore relationships demographic characteristic , cytokine concentration , hemostasis airflow limitation professional group .</detailed_description>
