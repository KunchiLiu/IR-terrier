	<brief_title>Signature Acetabular Posterior/Lateral Data Collection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using advanced surgical technique may assist surgeon patient variety way include identify specific-size prosthesis prior surgery , increase operating room efficiency , reduce number traditional instrument need . This may reduce cost associate instrument inventory instrument sterilization . Operating time may also reduce , potentially decrease patient 's risk infection . However , hypothesis test , important fully understand efficacy accuracy Signature Custom Guides use Total Hip Arthroplasty .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects one follow indication : Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease include osteoarthritis avascular necrosis . Rheumatoid arthritis . Correction functional deformity . Treatment nonunion , femoral neck fracture , trochanteric fracture proximal femur head involvement , unmanageable technique . Additional inclusion criterion include : Subjects require primary total hip arthroplasty 20 75 year age Subjects diagnosis osteoarthritis traumatic arthritis Subjects willing return followup evaluation . Subjects read , understand study information give write consent without representation legally authorize representative . Bilateral patient include stag . Only Posterior Lateral Approach use inclusion study Exclusion criterion accordance Contraindications Biomet primary acetabular cup . Absolute contraindication include : infection , sepsis , osteomyelitis , failure previous joint replacement . Additional contraindication include : Subjects whose bony structure deviate substantially general norm sufficiently require nonstandard implant . Specific example total dislocation hip , severe coxa vera deformity , severe form multiple epiphyseal dysplasia Subjects unable cooperate complete study Dementia inability understand follow instruction Neurological condition affect movement Pregnancy Additional exclusion criterion include : Surgical approach posterior lateral .
