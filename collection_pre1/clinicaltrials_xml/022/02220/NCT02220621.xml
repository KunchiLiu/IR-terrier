	<brief_summary>Intrauterine adhesion ( IUA ) adhesion intrauterine tissue due exposure myometrial tissue cause endometrial basal injury . IUA clinically manifest symptom abdominal pain , hypomenorrhea amenorrhea , sterility habitual abortion , seriously affect patient quality life . Preventing IUA try use different method barrier stent order separate oppose endometrium tissue heal process . Although success report still challenge need dealt . One barrier material prevent IUA make hyaluronic acid ( HA ) . HA natural ECM human tissue excellent biocompatibility promote scar-free wound repair . The self-crosslinked esterified HA gel demonstrate capacity prevent IUA clinical study . A novel self-crosslinked HA gel develop BioRegen Biomedical（Changzhou）Co. , Ltd proprietary technology . This product highly viscoelastic crosslinked gel overcomes shortcoming sodium hyaluronate high motility quick degradation vivo . For product , result animal experiment various safety feature design test conform national regulation standard . In order launch product market , prospective , randomize control clinical trial design perform verify safety/efficacy .</brief_summary>
