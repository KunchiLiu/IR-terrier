	<brief_summary>The purpose study monitor activity periodontal disease suggest potential biomarkers relate active periodontal disease patient chronic periodontitis ( PD ) associate type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , base evaluation profile gene expression periodontal sit evaluation inflammatory salivary protein . Two hundred five periodontal patient enrol , 41 exhibit ≥ 1 mm attachment loss least three periodontal site ( active site ) 2 month non-surgical periodontal therapy . The final sample : 21 patient chronic periodontitis ( PD group ) 20 chronic periodontitis diabetes ( PD+DM group ) . Fifteen periodontal- systemically healthy patient include control group . Saliva collection , glycated hemoglobin measurement , periodontal examination radiograph conduct 2 month non-surgical periodontal therapy . Radiographic subtraction perform pair radiograph . Measurements area density loss record . Gingival biopsy active non-active site similar clinical parameter harvest Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Array gene expression analysis . Saliva sample analyze Multiplex Cytokine Profiling Immunoassay analysis protein expression . The clinical attachment loss mean high PD+DM group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . There high correlation clinical attachment loss darken radiographic area active site PD group PD+DM group . When compare PD group PD+DM , patient diabetes up-regulated profile . Active site PD group show nine gene ( specific chemokines , interleukin receptor ) differentially express up-regulated profile . Active site PD+DM group show six gene ( specific chemokines , interleukin receptor ) differentially express up-regulated profile . After periodontal therapy , reduction salivary protein periodontal group , significant . In conclusion , possible identify gene differentially express active site group , may consider useful indicate potential biomarkers diagnosis periodontitis ; salivary protein show trend distinguish standard health disease may use future potential biomarkers periodontitis without diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This case-control longitudinal study carry University São Paulo March 2009 June 2012 joint collaboration Department Oral Surgery Periodontology Department Internal Medicine , Division Endocrinology Metabolism . It review approved Institutional Human Ethics Research Committee Ribeirão School Dentistry - University Sao Paulo ( process n. 2009.1.88.58.7 ) . The clinical attachment loss 1 mm determine accord tolerance method adapt computerized periodontal probe , consider standard deviation 0.3 mm electronic probe multiply 3 . Teeth prosthesis furcation lesion consider . The periodontal site clinical attachment call active site . Before begin initial clinical examination , supragingival scale ultrasonic device perform facilitate examination . The clinical parameter evaluate : probe pocket depth , relative clinical attachment level bleed probe record six site per tooth aid computerize periodontal probe . To reduce variation baseline 12-month evaluation , acrylic stent use standardize position computerize periodontal probe . Bleeding probe assess accord presence absence bleed 20 second probe . The plaque index , presence absence biofilm , record four site per tooth . It also verify furcation involvement aid manual periodontal probe . All clinical parameter record two week supragingival scaling ( baseline ) two month non-surgical periodontal therapy one-blinded calibrated examiner . A calibration exercise perform achieve acceptable intraexaminer reproducibility . For metabolic control assessment , HbA1c level analyze patient group baseline two month non-surgical periodontal therapy , Endocrinology Clinic Ribeirão Preto School Medicine , University São Paulo . All diabetic supervision endocrinologist advised communicate change medicine intake diet . A program plaque control dental prophylaxis oral hygiene instruction , scale root planning session perform operator use curette ultrasonic device PD PD+DM group . All scale root planning procedure inspect second operator . Oral hygiene review week month periodontal disinfection , follow dental prophylaxis . In PD+DM group , non-surgical periodontal therapy associate systemic doxycycline 100 mg/day , two week initial dose 200 mg , start day periodontal therapy . Patients PD group access information antibiotic administration patient PD+DM group . Non-stimulated whole expectorate saliva collect ( ~ 3 ml ) subject sterile tube . Subjects refrain eating , drinking , oral hygiene 2 hour prior saliva collection . Saliva sample place ice immediately aliquoted prior freezing -80º Celsius . Samples thaw analyze within 6 month collection . A complete series radiograph take patient baseline , use parallel technique . Two month periodontal therapy , radiographs take technique teeth active periodontal site . Thereafter , radiograph digitize tagged image file format ( TIFF ) scanner . Digital subtraction radiograph perform baseline 2-month radiograph use specific software . Only teeth interproximal site periodontal disease activity include analysis . Changes radiographs depict darkened area loss alveolar bone mass . These area measure ( mm2 ) use specific measurement software . As clinical examination , perform intra-examiner calibration measurement area radiographic density loss . Gingival tissue sample obtain active site patient group regular periodontal surgery . The excised gingival collar carefully remove root alveolar process . Gingival biopsy comprise epithelial connective tissue . The sample immediately submerge liquid nitrogen store -80º Celsius RNA extraction gene expression analysis . Total RNA biopsy extract use Trizol reagent accord direction supply manufacturer . From 1 µg total RNA , strand complementary DNA ( cDNA ) synthesize reverse transcription reaction accord direction supply manufacturer . At end reaction , cDNA store -20º Celsius later use . The Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) Array allow simultaneous analysis 84 gene involve specific signal pathway . The gene include PCR array plat human inflammatory cytokine receptor .</detailed_description>
