	<detailed_description>- The perioperative period significant source psychological burden , anxiety fear patient - Both pharmacological non-pharmacological method propose order alleviate perioperative stress - Music one non-pharmacological method use context , favorable effect preoperatively postoperatively - Listening music preoperative period prove useful adjunct premedication even use instead premedication . Additionally , listen music postoperatively also useful , since relate favorable recovery profile possible attenuation postoperative pain . In context , music also use Intensive Care Units , measurable effect anxiety scale hemodynamic parameter . There also study investigate use music operation general anesthesia , show music listen substantially decrease need anxiolytic administration throughout operation - The attenuation perioperative stress music listening probably due activation emotional cognitive process evoke feeling pleasure distract patient ' attention fear unpleasant thought related surgical procedure - Although favorable effect music listen regional anesthesia attenuation intraoperative stress conscious patient less expect easily interpret , less known regard effect intraoperative music listen anesthetize , unconscious patient - Generally , notion general anesthesia completely abolish auditory perception process intraoperative event occur unconscious patient , even absence postoperative recall - The preservation form auditory process general anesthesia necessarily undesirable used patient 's benefit , since show subject patient therapeutic suggestion general anesthesia improve recovery parameter decrease hospital stay - The investigator hypothesis intraoperative music listen decrease anesthetic requirement . Therefore , investigator investigate sevoflurane consumption necessary achieve depth anesthesia correspond bispectral index value 45-55 . Female patient subject abdominal hysterectomy benign disease randomize one two group : first group , audiotapes play relax soothe orchestral music place patient ' ear induction general anesthesia group set audiotape use without however play music - Sevoflurane consumption estimate weigh sevoflurane vaporizer high-precision scale induction completion surgical procedure . Patients also query regard recall sound intraoperative event , dream anesthetize asked rate satisfaction anesthesia . Recovery parameter also investigate , postoperative nausea vomit intensity postoperative pain . To ensure homogeneity , standardize analgesia administer two group - Since prolactin relate neuroendocrine response stress , blood also sample predetermined timepoints anesthesia , detect potential difference two group - The clinical interest study lie fact non-costly intervention music listen anesthesia lead reduce requirement anesthetic agent reduce need postoperative analgesia , theoretically translate reduction anesthetic cost . In addition , improvement recovery profile parameter could lead quick discharge post-anesthesia care unit reduction turnaround time overall time optimization .</detailed_description>
