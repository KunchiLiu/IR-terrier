	<brief_title>PhysioFlow Detect Cardiotoxicity Chemo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective compare PhysioFlow MUGA scan see result statistically use technique . This know non-inferior study . The advantage PhysioFlow non-invasive , fast do bedside patient receive chemotherapy . The patient test MUGA scan , per standard care , chemotherapy initiate every 3 month . The patient also test PhysioFlow date MUGA scan . In addition , patient test chemotherapy cycle PhysioFlow . Should PhysioFlow indicate patient cardiac toxicity patient receive chemotherapy , result confirm MUGA scan .</detailed_description>
