	<brief_summary>In study , participant program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) -positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) randomize receive single agent pembrolizumab 35 treatment standard care ( SOC ) platinum-based chemotherapy ( carboplatin + paclitaxel carboplatin + pemetrexed 4 6 21-day cycle ) . Participants platinum-based chemotherapy arm non-squamous tumor histology may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy 4 6 cycle chemotherapy . The primary study hypothesis pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival ( OS ) compare SOC chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
