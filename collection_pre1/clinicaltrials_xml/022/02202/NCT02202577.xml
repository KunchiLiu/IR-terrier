	<brief_title>Chlorhexidine-Alcohol Versus Povidone-Iodine Cesarean Antisepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients consider likely need cesarean delivery planning cesarean recruit consent study participation prenatal care and/or time admission labor delivery . Patients undergo cesarean meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize one two surgical preparation list ( 1 . Chlorhexidine Gluconate ( CHG ) -alcohol , 2 . Povidone Iodine ( P-I ) scrub paint . Randomization perform consent surgeon ( list key personnel ) patient arrive operating room cesarean . Pre-operative surgical site antisepsis perform accord randomization . All surgical practice remain surgeon 's discretion accord standard care Metrohealth . Patients examine daily obstetric team evaluate sign symptom surgical site infection , standard investigator institution . The chart review determine patient diagnose admission , , re-admitted surgical site infection . The patient also question regard treatment diagnosis Surgical Site Infection ( SSI ) occur discharge home routine six week post-operative visit . If patient return routine post-operative visit , investigator attempt contact patient telephone determine patient diagnose treated surgical site infection . If patient lose 6 week follow , subanalysis perform available data derive hospitalization hospital Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) . Data capture Red CAP database . Additional data capture may affect patient likelihood surgical site infection ensure group statistically equal risk factor SSI : labor rupture membrane prior cesarean , maternal age , estimate gestational age , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , gravity , parity , race , smoke status , hypertensive morbidity , diabetes , estimate blood loss , operative time , race , insurance type , general versus regional anesthesia , appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis give , skin closure ( suture v. staple ) . Power analysis perform : assume 7.5 % risk cesarean site infection 50 % reduction chlorhexidine , 932 individual recruit . Approximately 800 cesarean perform investigator institution per year investigator anticipate 80 % eligible participate . Data review do every 6 month every 200 patient analyze , whichever sooner . Analysis perform Primary Investigators ( PI ) completeness , accuracy , strict adherence study protocol , safety , statistical significance . The investigator site also subject periodic audit investigator Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) .</detailed_description>
