	<brief_summary>Background : Cardiovascular disease major health problem worldwide understand genetic contribution development cardiovascular disease increase significantly . The CD36 protein associate uptake oxidized form LDL single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs1761667 A/G CD36 gene correlate increase consumption total fat . The transcription factor STAT3 release inflammatory acute phase response SNP rs8069645 G/A STAT3 gene associate abdominal obesity high intake saturate fat . Studies show benefit Mediterranean diet secondary prevention cardiovascular disease dietary pattern often study nutrigenetic approach ; study , however , often limited European population , make difficult generalize different population . Hypothesis : Different dietary approach may similarly influence modify metabolic , inflammatory anthropometric profile , especially among patient coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) . The genetic interaction environmental factor nutrient intake , prescription different diet accord individual genotype , could influence development and/or treatment cardiovascular disease . Objective : To evaluate effect three dietary approach metabolic , inflammatory anthropometric profile patient CAD possible interaction polymorphisms CD36 STAT3 gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polymorphisms CD36 STAT3 Genes Different Dietary Interventions Among Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized clinical trial nutrigenetic approach among patient ≥ 40 year diagnose CAD . Randomization make block list random number generate site www.randomization.org ( seal opaque envelope ) . A questionnaire demographic clinical data apply ; systolic diastolic blood pressure , waist , hip neck circumference , height weight assess . Nutrients intake assess food diary . Laboratory evaluation consist lipid profile ( LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol total cholesterol , serum triglyceride ) , glycemic profile ( fast plasma glucose , glycated hemoglobin ) inflammatory profile ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , TNF-alpha , interleukin-6 interleukin-10 ) . Genotyping make TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay® . Patients randomize three group : Group 1 Intervention [ Supplementation nut ( SN ) ] : standard dietary guideline + 30g nut day ; Group 2 Intervention [ Supplementation olive oil ( SAO ) ] : standard dietary guideline + 30ml olive oil day ; Group 3 [ Control diet ( CO ) ] : standard dietary guideline . Patients follow three month ( 12 week ) primary endpoint change LDL-cholesterol . The follow-up visit make 30 day , 60 day 90 day ( final visit ) .</detailed_description>
