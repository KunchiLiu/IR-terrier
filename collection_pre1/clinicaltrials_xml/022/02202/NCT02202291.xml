	<brief_summary>Vasospasm transient contraction cause decrease caliber vessel thus decrease vascularization vascular territory lead suffer tissue sector concern . Vasospasm-related disease different clinical presentation migraine , spastic angina , hypertension relate vasospasm primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) . These disease therapeutic method due poorly understood pathophysiology . For migraine angina , vascular exploration problematic unlike primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) . Primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) common peripheral vascular disease cold estimate prevalence 5-9 % general population . It expression extreme vasospasm microcirculation extremity link hypersensitivity cold clinically express occurrence syncope stag finger anesthetize white , follow stage hyperemic restaining . The objective study identify new metabolic pathway involve vasospasm order consider new specific treatment , currently lack . The identification pathway make detection genetic abnormality cause vasospasm Raynaud 's phenomenon . This disease perfectly appropriate model study vasospasm high frequency population , hereditary nature simple diagnosis . The powerful current genetic strategy apply model ( exome sequencing combine family connection analysis ) .</brief_summary>
