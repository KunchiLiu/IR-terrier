	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess bladder cancer recurrence free rate , accord phase II pilot study , intravesical instillation sequential BCG EMDA/MMC TUR . The study design one-sample investigation : outcome measure disease recurrence rate . Follow continue 5 year . For sample size determination , disease recurrence rate compare literature data recurrence rate obtain standard BCG alone administration ( Lamm 's protocol ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Electromotive Mitomycin-C After Transuretheral Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TURBT ( TransUrethral Resection Bladder Tumor ) Prior enrolment , patient must sign consent form Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , Basic Metabolic Panel ( BMP ) Urinalysis ( UA ) perform . The patient White Blood Count ( WBC ) must great 4.0 10^9/L platelet count great 150 10^9/L receive drug . Week 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 8 : BCG instillation : 50 mg wet weight ( 10•2±9•0x108 colony-forming unit ) BCG Connaught substrain . Lyophilised ( ie , freeze-dried ) BCG suspend 50 ml bacteriostatic-free 0.9 % Sodium Chloride ( NaCl ) solution . After bladder draining , suspension infuse intravesically 14 Fr Foley catheter retain bladder 60-90 min ; bladder empty follow catheter removal . Week 3 , 6 9 : A Foley catheter insert bladder carefully drain . 40 mg MMC dissolve 100 ml NaCl 0.9 % solution instill intravesically electrode catheter gravity retain bladder 30 min , 23 mA 30 min pulse electric current give externally . Two dispersive cathode electrode place low abdominal skin degrease alcohol . The bladder empty catheter remove . Patients assign one course treatment per week 6 week sequential BCG EMDA/MMC . Two BCG instillation one EMDA/MMC instillation constitute one cycle total two cycle . A CBC basic metabolic panel ( BMP ) perform weekly beginning cycle . Prior dose mitomycin C week 3 , CBC perform also week 4 5 CBC change . A UA perform prior intravesicular instillation . Maintenance treatment eMMC give month 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 10 ( last dose BCG initial treatment ) . Maintenance BCG give around month 5 , 8 , 11 . CBC , BMP , UA , history/physical ( H &amp; P ) perform EMDA/MMC procedure . UA H &amp; P perform BCG .</detailed_description>
