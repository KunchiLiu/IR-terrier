	<brief_title>The Improvement Limbal Epithelial Culture Technique Using Collagenase Isolate Limbal Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer unilateral limbal stem cell insufficiency understand benefit risk factor operation enrol clinical trial . Two week transplantation , investigator first take 1-2 mm2 limbal tissue healthy eye , digest tissue collagenase , get epithelial cell cluster . The cell cluster culture amniotic membrane SHEM medium contain Dulbecco 's modify Eagle 's medium/F12 ( 1:1 ) , 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide , 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor , 5μg/ml insulin , 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone , 1 nM cholera toxin , 50μg/ml gentamicin , 1.25μg/ml amphotericin B . Seven ten day later successful culture , transplantation perform cell reach 1.5-2 cm2 compact confluent epithelial sheet without evidence contamination . During operation , lamellar keratectomy perform remove abnormal corneal neovascularization scar tissue . The cultivated epithelial sheet transplant denuded corneal surface fibrin glue suture technique . The patient plan admitted 2 week . After discharge , follow patient perform one week , two week , one month , two month , three month , six month one year later . Pictures external eye take extent corneal epithelium regeneration , visual acuity , complication record follow-up visit . The investigator plan collect 10 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : 1870 year old . 2 . Lesion eye limbal insufficiency 180 degree . 3 . Lesion eye recurrent corneal erosion , corneal neovascularisation poor vision cause limbal insufficiency . 4 . The symptom 1/2 year , possibility improvement medical treatment . 5 . The patient receive operation long term post operative followup . 6 . The patient infected AIDS , hepatitis B/C , willing receive associated examination . 7 . The patient plan pregnant day cell culture transplantation 1 year . They also agree receive pregnant test . 8 . The condition cell culture 1st clinical trial successful . 1 . Bilateral limbal insufficiency . 2 . No recurrent corneal erosion , corneal neovascularisation poor vision find due limbal insufficiency . If corneal neovascularisation find deep anterior 1/2 corneal stroma , corneal thickness le 200 um evaluate anterior segment OCT ultrasound pachymetry , patient exclude operation criterion . If corneal thickness become thicker , patient enrol operation . 3 . About corneal sedation , value check CocetBonnet esthesiometer le 5 mm , patient exclude operation . 4 . The condition improve medication , resolve spontaneously . 5 . Postoperative follow less 1/2 year 6 . The patient ca n't receive long term postoperative follow 7 . No light perception , expect poor prognosis 8 . If intraocular pressure 21 mmHg necessary glaucoma surgery antiglaucoma medication , optic disc cup 90 % , visual field find severe defect , patient exclude clinical trial . 9 . Severe lagophthalmos trichiasis , receive blepharoplasty . 10 . Severe dry eye syndrome . Those patient schirmer 's test result le 1 mm exclude . 11 . If cell first part clinical trial ca n't successfully cultivate , patient exclude . If patient insist received treatment , enrol 3 month later . 12 . Pregnancy</criteria>
