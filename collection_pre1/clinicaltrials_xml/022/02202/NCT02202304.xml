	<brief_summary>Cervitec , chlorhexidine base varnish proven reduce caries risk young population . This study want investigate use product would reduce risk lose abutment teeth patient wear partial denture literature prove teeth prone caries periodontal disease . The primary objective research project : 1 . Assess topical application CHX/thymol varnish every three month partial denture abutment teeth result clinicallu significant decrease loss attachment compare application , 2 . Assess topical application CHX/thymol vanirhs every three month partial denture abutment teeth result clinically significant decrease carious lesion development progression compare application . The secondary objective research project : 1 . Assess topical application CHX/thymol varnish every three month partial denture abutment teeth compare application result clinically significant difference : 1 . Bleeding probe ( BoP ) . 2 . Plaque formation . 3 . Periodontal pocket depth . 4 . Microbial composition GCF cytokine profile sub gingival environment . 5 . The patient self perception oral health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- 2 baseline sample Gingival Crevicular Fluid ( GCF ) subgingival sample . The first baseline sample do day first impression second one day denture fitting . - The following information record CRFs : Silness Löe Plaque index , BoP , probe depth , clinical attachment level , LoA , Kennedy classification , material partial denture type clasp ( clasp ) ICDAS code . - The patient also fill OHIP-14 questionnaire ( Oral Health Impact Profile ) ass self perception oral health . - A photograph abutment teeth partial denture take . - We also take full history patient include : name , DOB medication . - The GCF subgingival sample take every 6 month appointment varnish apply . - All laboratory sample labelles identification number patient allocate date also write . All sample analyse Plymouth store - 50°C freezer ( sample take University Aberdeen store type freezer ship periodically Penninsula University test maintain temperature condition ) . They test microbial composition GCF cytokine profile sub gingival environment - All measurement reassess 12 month 24 month . In addition denture hygiene index : Budtz-Jørgensen ( 1977 ) Index ( plaque accumulation denture ) . The data collect one clinician dental school . All clinician calibrate appropriately . Calibration : Before examination start assess consistency examiner ( intra-exmainer ) also variation exmainers ( inter-exmainer reproducibility ) . Each examiner independently examiner group 20 subject compare finding . When finding contain major discrepancy , subject recall order difference diagnose reviewed exmainers resolve group discussion . If certain examiner consistently produce significantly different result majority , attmepts correct performance fail , exclude team . It make clear potential examiner , exmainations begin , ability standardize examination result measure clinical skill ( Oral Health Surveys 4th edition . WHO . Geneva 1997 ) All data record case report form ( CRFs ) .</detailed_description>
