We hypothesize set 5 minute video teach important skill stroke survivor caregiver , replay cell phone extend learning , increase adherence Medications stroke improve control blood pressure , elevate cholesterol glucose participant get cell phone base educational video .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using 5 Minute Videos Numeracy Literacy Challenged Stroke Survivors Improve Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 80 % patient stroke , event may prevent alter lifestyle behavioral risk , increase adherence medication control hypertension , diabetes , lipid . Yet , exist huge science implementation gap adopt widely recognize beneficial medicine lifestyle change . Those need remain unable actualize benefit science , due lack knowledge , perceive complexity , literacy challenge , limited time poorly communicate doctor crowd clinic essentially , failure regional scientist translate Western science creative resonant way enable wider uptake . In randomized double blind translational implementation study , study effectiveness implementation tactic deliver enable stroke education risk reduction literacy numeracy challenge Pakistani stroke survivor caregiver , via short film teach stroke recognition , healthy habit , medication adherence self-care . These 5 minute film , use 'show tell ' approach , replayed tablet , show stroke patient intervention arm . The primary objective study answer research question - Does video base education give stroke patient ( mild moderate disability ) caregiver discharge , follow , improve adherence therapy control three major risk factor ( Diabetes , hypertension dyslipidemia ) twelve month post index stroke ?</detailed_description>
