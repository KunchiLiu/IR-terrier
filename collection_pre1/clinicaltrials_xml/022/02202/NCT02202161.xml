	<brief_summary>This study conduct evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics GSK2330672 compare sitagliptin administer metformin 14 day subject type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Approximately 72 male female subject age 30-64 year T2DM currently take metformin recruit study . Eligible subject begin run-in period 13-15 day stabilize metformin 850 milligram ( mg ) twice day ( BID ) . Subjects randomize GSK2330672 10 mg , 20 mg , 30 mg , 90 mg , match placebo open-label sitagliptin 50 mg 14 day BID . Subjects return follow-up visit 7-10 day discharge .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female 30 64 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent Subjects diagnosis T2DM least 3 month prior screen , take metformin least 4 week prior screen , take metformin daily dose &gt; = 1000 mg Glycosolated haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) value 711 % inclusive screening . The investigator make effort obtain documentation medical history prescription metformin substantiate diagnosis T2DM Fasting plasma glucose &lt; 280 milligram per deciliter ( mg/dl ) screening . A subject fasting plasma glucose Day 1 100 mg/dl low screen value must randomize All T2DM subject must meet label recommendation metformin sitagliptin , include : Adequate renal function , evidence estimate glomerular filtration rate &gt; = 80 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) use modification diet renal disease ( MDRD ) equation chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration ( CKDEPI ) formula study procedure manual ( SPM ) ; No condition make hypoxia , dehydration , sepsis likely ; No cardiac disease ( include history myocardial infarction , stroke , hospitalization acute coronary syndrome , heart failure ) Body mass index ( BMI ) within range 24 40 kilogram per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) Other T2DM , subject good general health ( opinion investigator ) clinically significant relevant abnormality medical history physical examination would introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure objective , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory test A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential define : Premenopausal female document tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy [ definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ] ; OR Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . In questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 million international unit ( MlU ) /mL estradiol &lt; 40 picogram ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 147 picomol per liter ) confirmatory . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method describe Investigator/designee , wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method describe Investigator/designee . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication followup visit Subjects must willing discontinue usual dose metformin take study dose 850 mg immediate release formulation metformin BID 1315 day runin period 2week treatment period Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form The use approve nonmetformin antidiabetic agent within 3 month screen visit Hypoglycemia unawareness .
