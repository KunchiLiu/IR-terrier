	<brief_summary>This study complementary main study `` Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Serum Levels Evolution During Six Months After Alcohol Withdrawal `` NCT01491347 . Liver stiffness variation one major somatic effect chronic alcohol consumption . It consequence numerous mechanism , include inflammation . Liver stiffness seem depend alcohol consumption alcohol dependent patient , precisely time last alcohol consumption . This documented alcohol withdrawal , never explore several month withdrawal function alcohol consumption abstinence . Brain Derived neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) seem play major role general homeostasis also liver function . We propose analyse serum BDNF level variation withdrawal accord liver stiffness level alcohol consumption status . We also measure liver stiffness use FibroscanÂ® alcohol dependent subject include main study search link serum BDNF level abstinence day 0 , 14 , 28 month 2 , 4 , 6 .</brief_summary>
