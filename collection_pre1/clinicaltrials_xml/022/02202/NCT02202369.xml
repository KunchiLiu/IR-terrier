	<brief_title>Multimodal Analgesia v . Routine Care Pain Management Lumbar Spine Fusion Surgery : A Prospective Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To compare postoperative pain level single level lumbar fusion patient treat either MMA pain management protocol standard pain management protocol . Controlling postoperative pain critical first step facilitate patient 's recovery improve quality life . In-hospital pain level measure use numeric pain scale scale 0-10 . Pain assessment conduct hospital nurse standard care protocol . Assessments every four six hour , within 60 minute receive pain medication Hypothesis : Patients treat MMA pain protocol significantly less immediate postoperative pain compare patient treated standard pain protocol . Specific Aim # 2 : To compare immediate postoperative , in-hospital , narcotic consumption single level lumbar fusion patient treat either MMA pain management protocol standard pain management protocol . Decreasing narcotic consumption follow lumbar spinal fusion surgery important faster recovery patient , decrease narcotic related side effect ( nausea vomiting , lethargy , ileus , etc ) well lower overall treatment cost . The total amount narcotic use course hospitalization subject record . Dosages narcotic convert morphine equivalent . Hypothesis : Patients treat MMA pain protocol consume significantly less immediate postoperative narcotic pain medication compare patient treated standard pain protocol . Specific Aim # 3 : To compare length hospital stay single level lumbar fusion patient treat either MMA pain management protocol standard pain management protocol . Decreasing amount time patient remain hospital may decrease time take patient return personal societal responsibility . Additionally reduce patient risk nosocomial infection reduces cost surgery . Hypothesis : Patients treat MMA pain protocol significantly reduce length stay hospital compare patient treated standard pain protocol . Specific Aim # 4 : To compare postoperative quality life single level lumbar fusion patient treat either MMA pain management protocol standard pain management protocol . The primary purpose lumbar fusion surgery improve quality life patient . The Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) use disease specific measure . The Veterans Rand 12 ( VR-12 ) use general health outcome measure . Each patient report outcome measure collect pre-operatively follow postoperative visit : 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 visit , 1 visit , 2 year . Hypothesis : Patients treat MMA pain protocol significantly great improvement Quality Life measure compare patient treated standard pain protocol sustain two year post-operatively .</detailed_description>
