	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes ( CFRD ) occur almost 20 % teens 50 % adult . The investigator ' long term goal determine cause CFRD order translate knowledge therapy aim prevent CFRD . Since CFRD type 2 diabetes share several clinical feature since oxidative stress key factor development type 2 diabetes , investigator explore role oxidative stress CFRD . The investigator discover unique CF biochemical signature believe could implicate development CFRD . The investigator find glucose ingestion CF teens young adult cause acute profound systemic redox imbalance oxidize state . The degree redox imbalance quite severe would expect damage insulin produce cell cell particularly vulnerable oxidative stress . Thus , finding could prove critical factor pathogenesis CFRD . This proposal test hypothesis glucose-induced redox imbalance intrinsic , metabolic defect CF . In addition , CF people require consume high calorie diet maintain weight , investigator also hypothesize certain high caloric food recapitulate redox imbalance induce ingest glucose thus hasten development CFRD . Specifically , investigator aim : - Determine whether young child CF glucose-induced redox imbalance - Determine whether eat meal high glycemic index induces acute redox imbalance</brief_summary>
