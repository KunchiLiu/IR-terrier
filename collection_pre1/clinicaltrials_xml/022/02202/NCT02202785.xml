	<brief_title>A Study MLN0264 Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call MLN0264 . MLN0264 test treat tumor people metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas express guanylyl cyclase C ( GCC ) . This study assess tumor size reduction patient administer MLN0264 . The study enroll 42 81 patient . All participant administer MLN0264 1.8 mg/kg single , 30-minute , intravenous ( IV ) infusion Day 1 3-week treatment cycle , follow rest period 20 day . Participants continue receive MLN0264 1 year disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . This multi-centre trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study approximately 19 month . Participants make 3 6 visit clinic per treatment cycle , end-of-treatment visit occur 30 day last dose study medication , follow-up assessment occur every 12 week death 6 month last patient completes treatment - whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
