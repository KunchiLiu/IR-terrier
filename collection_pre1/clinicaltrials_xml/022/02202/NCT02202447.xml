	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety EC1169 best dose use humans future study . This study also determine EC1169 distribute , break , pass absorbed body quickly eliminate ( leaf body ) . All patient receive EC1169 . As secondary objective Part A : To explore relationship baseline PSMA expression ( tumor patient level ) measure 99mTc-EC0652 scan antitumor activity EC1169 . As exploratory objective Part B : To assess EC0652 predictive biomarker efficacy EC1169 compare PSMA-positive PSMA-negative lesion response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 EC1169 In Patients With Recurrent MCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , non-randomized , oncology study conduct 2 part . Part A dose-escalation phase determine Recommended Phase 2 ( RP2 ) dose follow : - Evaluate administration EC1169 QW Weeks 1 2 3-week schedule - Evaluate safety pharmacokinetic profile EC1169 EC0652 - To assess preliminary efficacy result patient metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) progress abiraterone and/or enzalutamide , previously treat taxane . The primary objective Part B identify radiographic progression-free survival ( rPFS ) taxane-naïve taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patient receive treatment EC1169 .</detailed_description>
