	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) experience reduce perception respiratory resistive load versus healthy adult age group . Further , study determine whether people PD trouble swallow experience even reduction perception respiratory resistive load .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental design procedure : This prospective experimental study complete one study visit take 1 3 hour . Verbal write informed consent obtain qualified member investigative team . Following informed consent , participant complete health history questionnaire ass inclusion/exclusion criterion . For patient PD consent investigator review electronic medical record ensure inclusion/exclusion criterion meet . The experimental protocol consist 1 . ) Baseline pulmonary function measure , 2 . ) Baseline measure depression apathy , 3 . ) Presentation resistive inspiratory load via respiratory equipment , 4 . ) Rating perceive magnitude respiratory sensation measure modified Borg scale ( range 6 - breathing difficulty - 20 - maximal difficulty ) . For patient PD , investigator also review result rehabilitation barium swallow study perform part standard clinical care . Baseline Pulmonary function measure : The forced expired volume first second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) exhalation measure participant . Maximum inspiratory pressure ( PiMax ) measure manometer . The PiMax test repeat 3 measurement within 10 % variation obtain , least 1 minute rest trial . Baseline depression apathy : There significant impact emotion respiratory perceptual rating . As , measure baseline depression apathy score use 2 validated scale , Beck Depression Index ( BDI ) Marin Apathy Index ( MAI ) . These outcome measure , use determine exclusion criterion . Should depression ( 17 great BDI ) detect participant , participant provide contact information University Florida ( UF ) psychiatry psychology clinic encourage seek evaluation . In case severe depression detect ( 31 great BDI ) participant continue study , provide contact information UF psychiatry psychology clinic encourage seek evaluation . Inspiratory resistive load presentation : The participant seat chair , separate investigator experimental apparatus . The participant instruct `` relax breathe '' facemask connect non-rebreathing valve line differential pressure transducer . The inspiratory port valve connect resistive loading manifold . The manifold consist 5 differential resistor range 5 - 40 centimeters/water ( cmH2O ) resistive pressure , separate stopper port , well load condition . The load apply remove stop entire inspiratory breath , replace port continue rest tidal breathe . The pressure transducer provide measure mouth pressure airflow , digitize record desk top computer use LabChart software . Following loaded breath , participant provide estimate perceive difficulty breathe use modify Borg scale . Participants familiarize loads practice session prior initiate experimental protocol . During experimental session , participant listen music choice order mask experimental sound . The resistive load apply randomized block design , load breath separate least three unloaded breath . Two block complete load present 3 5 time within block . Therefore , total 15 25 loaded breath ( 3-5 load x 5 presentation ) per block . Participants instruct see small light flash briefly table front ( familiarized prior begin experiment ) resistive load apply next breath . Following loaded breath , participant ask estimate perceive difficulty breathe Borg scale . Rehabilitation barium swallow study : Participants PD refer rehabilitation barium swallow evaluation recruit study . Therefore , swallow evaluation part normal clinical care patient may vary base clinical necessity judge treat speech-language pathologist . Generally , standard clinical evaluation protocol consist multiple swallow thin liquid barium , pudding-thick barium , cracker cookie coat barium . For purpose study , researcher review recently record swallow study identify bad observe penetration-aspiration ( PA ) score ( range 1-8 , 1 penetration aspiration , 8 silent aspiration ) . The PA score record order determine whether participant trouble swallow ( score 3-8 ) ( score 1 2 ) .</detailed_description>
