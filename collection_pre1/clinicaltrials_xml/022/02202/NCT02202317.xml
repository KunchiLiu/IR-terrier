	<brief_summary>This prospective non-blinded case series involve acquisition pair production PET/CT soon possible already perform Y-90 Sirspheres treatment hepatic malignancy . It perform addition standard Brehmsstralung SPECT scan . The sequence two scan case ( PET/CT v SPECT ) determine availability scanner time . However , intend acquire day Y-90 treatment . The length subject participation one year . The measure use mostly qualitative nature , include : - Degree correlation expect vs. achieve tumor coverage treatment - Degree correlation treatment distribution depict Brehmsstrahlung scan vs. Internal Pair Production PET/CT scan , include assessment/comparison precision anatomic localization achieve two modality . - Determination Tumor/Background ratio , correlate plan dose - Detection non-target embolization , applicable , qualitative comparison two modality conspicuity abnormality Qualitative method use analysis obtain PET/CT image compare Brehmsstralung SPECT image previously describe . Tumor background ratio generate used metric correlation planned/administered dose also CT and/or FDG PET scan pre post treatment , available . For CT , RECIST criterion use calculate volume necrosis , would use correlation . For FDG PET scan , SUV would use correlation .</brief_summary>
