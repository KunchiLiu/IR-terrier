	<brief_summary>The investigator intend evaluate safety toxicity proﬁle intravesically administer multidrug regimen Cabazitaxel , Cisplatin Gemcitabine treatment refractory Transitional Cell Carcinoma.The investigator propose conduct combine phase I trial ass safety , toxicity , efﬁcacy novel multidrug intravesical regimen consist Cabazitaxel , Gemcitabine , Cisplatin ( CGC ) treatment BCG resistant non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder . This phase I trial combine dose cycle-escalation scheme enrollment 24 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravesical Cabazitaxel , Gemcitabine , Cisplatin ( CGC ) Treatment Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonsurgical treatment strategy BCG refractory bladder cancer fail prove reliable option increase survival among subset bladder cancer patient . For patient , removal bladder associate perioperative risk subsequent reduction quality life , remain option . Prior attempts second line treatment include intravesical ( within bladder ) monotherapy range drug include Gemcitabine Paclitaxel ( taxane , similar Cabazitaxel ) . These drug show potential improvement small number patient Given synergy systemic chemotherapy , believe multidrug regimen would allow improvement survival among patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis non muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder study institution prior begin study . This include patient : High grade Ta papillary lesion ( ) High low grade T1 papillary lesion ( ) Carcinoma In Situ ( CIS ) , without Ta T1 papillary tumor ( ) grade The patient must Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) refractory recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer Refractory disease define evidence persistent high risk bladder cancer ( high grade Ta , T1 and/or CIS ) first cystoscopic exam initial 6 week induction course BCG 6 month cystoscopic exam . Recurrent disease define reappearance disease achieve tumor free status 6 month follow full induction course Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) without maintenance Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) . Participants must recur within 18 month follow last dose Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) . Lowgrade superficial ( Ta ) disease consider recurrent . Patients must exhibit disease recurrence receive form standard intravesical therapy must include minimum one induction course Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) may also include prior exposure mitomycin , interferon , single agent gemcitabine taxane therapy maintenance . Patients must eligible radical cystectomy refuse standard care treatment surgical candidate radical cystectomy base comorbidities .
