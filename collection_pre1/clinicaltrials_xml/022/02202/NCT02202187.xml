	<detailed_description>GSK2140944 belong Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor ( BTI ) class antibiotic develop treatment Gram positive [ include methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) ] Gram-negative pathogen associate respiratory tract skin soft tissue infection include isolates resistant exist class antimicrobial . Study BTZ114595 first administration GSK2140944 human . This study examine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics escalate single oral dos GSK2140944 . The predicted clinical target efficacy , base preclinical efficacy model , AUC ( 0-24 ) 16-30 μg.h/mL . This study aim explore safety tolerability target exposure order establish therapeutic window compound . This study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics escalate single oral dos GSK2140944 . This randomized , placebo-controlled , single-blind study determine safety , tolerability , single dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile GSK2140944 healthy subject . The projected single escalating dos GSK2140944 range start dose 100 mg maximum dose 3000 mg . The current plan administer study drug overnight fast , base emerge PK safety data , may necessary administer study drug feed state well understand safety , tolerability PK GSK2140944 . Any decision remove modify fasting requirement make GSK Study Team investigator base joint review emerge safety , tolerability preliminary pharmacokinetic data prior dose-levels .</detailed_description>
