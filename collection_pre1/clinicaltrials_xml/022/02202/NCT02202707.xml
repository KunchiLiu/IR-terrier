	<detailed_description>Visit 1 : Screening &amp; Acclimation Visit The informed consent process study complete sign informed consent form obtain Spaulding Hospital Cambridge . Subjects screen ensure meet preliminary eligibility criterion . All subject undergo clinical interview determine presence medical disorder . The follow study assessment complete : - 12-lead EKG - Resting blood pressure heart rate - Height Weight Visit 2 : VMS Determination At-Home Assessments Subjects interview mental health history , complete questionnaire VMS , related quality-of-life symptom ( sleep , mood ) quality-of-life . Blood drawn confirm eligibility ass diabetes chronic kidney disease ( see exclusion criterion ) . Subjects give 7-day VMS Diary 7-day Sleep Diary end visit , complete home follow week . Participants also give actigraphic watch take home wear 7 day order capture sleep/wake pattern activity level exploratory analysis . During 7 day at-home VMS sleep monitoring , subject also wear portable VMS monitor 24 hour measure objective VMS frequency . Visit 3 : Final Eligibility Determination &amp; Lab VMS Monitoring Subjects return objective VMS monitor VMS sleep diary , result blood test take Visit 2 review ensure eligibility . Eligible subject participate 6-hour laboratory objective VMS monitoring session wear objective VMS monitor simultaneously subjectively monitor VMS experience write diary event marker . Objective VMS measure obtain visit primary baseline measure VMS investigation . Those least 2 objective VMS measure 6-hour monitoring period deem eligible referred baseline study start medication . Participants give additional VMS sleep diary complete daily basis throughout rest study period . Visit 4 : Laboratory Testing Visit &amp; Medication Distribution All study perform ~8-10 occur time second laboratory test visit . All subject instruct abstain vigorous exercise 2 day prior study avoid autonomic neuroendocrine effect exercise . In addition , subject refrain caffeine alcohol previous 24 hr , study 12 hr fast . A . Study Visit : Parameters Measured 1 . Electrocardiogram . 2 . Arterial Pressure . 3 . Respiration . 4 . Sympathetic Microneurography . 5 . Beat-by-Beat Leg Blood Flow . B . Drugs Study Human Physiology 1 ) Intravenous bolus injection 100 ug nitroprusside bolus ( vasodilator drop pressure ) 2 ) Intravenous bolus injection 150 ug phenylephrine bolus ( vasoconstrictor raise pressure ) . These two drug use drop raise pressure range arterial pressure within short time , approximately 2 minute . These medication raise low blood pressure amount typically experienced day perform activity climb stair move sit stand . C. Data collected/Timing collection The study visit take 4 hour . Throughout protocol , subject lie supine instrument measurement ECG , beat-by-beat arterial pressure , brachial arterial pressure , respiratory excursion , popliteal blood flow velocity . After instrumentation calibration , instrumentation measurement peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity commence , internal search last maximum 60 minute . After either successful unsuccessful procurement nerve recording , test protocol start : Testing Protocol 1 . Baseline recordings/measurement ( ~10 minute ) : Subjects rest quietly 10 minute . 2 . Modified Oxford Baroreflex test ( 5 minutes/trial , 2 trial , ~30 minute total ) : An intravenous bolus injection 100 ug nitroprusside bolus , follow 1 minute 150 ug phenylephrine bolus . After first trial , second modify Oxford baroreflex test perform . At least 10-15 minute allow baroreflex trial insure heart rate , blood pressure nerve activity return resting level . Subjects continually assessed adverse event symptom related hypotension . 3 . Sustained isometric handgrip exercise ( ~10 minute ) : Subjects ask perform isometric handgrip exercise 30 % maximum effort sustain fatigue . 4 . Valsalva 's maneuver ( ~5 minute ) : Subjects ask blow tube via mouthpiece generate pressure ~40 mmHg sustain 12 second . Data collect one minute prior maneuver , one minute , two minute recovery trial . This repeat obtain three successful trial . 5 . Paced breathing ( ~15 minute total ) : Subjects ask maintain constant breathing frequency 15 breaths/min ( 0.25 Hz ) follow audio signal ( i.e. , `` , two , , two '' ) 5 minute short period acclimation . Distribution Study Medication : After baseline measure complete , study medication ( gabapentin ) distribute study participant participant instruct take titrate medication dose . Visit 5a : Medication Dosage &amp; Adverse Event Monitoring ( Telephone ) Study staff check study participant telephone gabapentin approximately one week monitor side effect adverse event medication . If subject experience intolerable side effect , take medication complete remain study procedure . In order track potential effect microneurography , subject electrode place beneath surface skin give Microneurography Questionnaire ( MSNA ) . Over last 18 year perform technique , roughly 5 % participant effect , often report effect ( &gt; 90 % ) slight bruise site insertion . Visit 5b : Medication Dosage &amp; Adverse Event Monitoring ( Telephone ) Study staff check study participant telephone gabapentin approximately three week monitor side effect adverse event medication . If subject experience intolerable side effect , take medication complete remain study procedure . Visit 6 : Objective VMS Monitoring All subject repeat 6-hour laboratory objective VMS monitoring session gabapentin post-treatment measure VMS , describe Visit 3 . Participants also complete set pre-treatment questionnaire VMS , related quality-of-life symptom ( sleep , mood ) quality-of-life . All subject give ambulatory VMS monitor wear 24 hour home , capture frequency VMS ambulatory set well actigraphic watch wear one-week period . Participants remind continue complete VMS sleep diary . Visit 7 : Laboratory Testing Visit &amp; Medication Collection Procedures perform Visit 4 repeat Visit 7 , collect data cardiovascular measure participant gabapentin least 4 week full dose . All VMS sleep diary , well unused study medication , actigraphic watch , objective VMS monitor , return collect visit .</detailed_description>
