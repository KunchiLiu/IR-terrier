	<detailed_description>Background : Patients severe kidney failure require dialysis transplantation survive . For transplant option , two main dialysis option : hemodialysis ( either incenter home ) home peritoneal dialysis . Home-based therapy ( peritoneal home hemodialysis ) under-utilized many Canadian jurisdiction proportion home-based therapy vary 10 40 % across centre . The use home dialysis remain low expect due combination patient , caregiver , provider , health system barrier . Previous study highlight several potential patient caregiver barrier use home therapy include knowledge , skill , personal circumstance , social support . Provider barrier report include lack train peritoneal dialysis , lack ( perceived lack ) skills knowledge , bias , possibly inadequate physician reimbursement home dialysis . The Canadian Kidney Knowledge Translation Generation Network ( CANN-NET ) , national network clinician , researcher knowledge user establish ensure best practice patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , recently create dialysis modality educational tool aim patient kidney health care provider . On behalf CANN-NET , investigator propose cluster randomize control trial ( cluster consist severe CKD clinic ) knowledge translation ( KT ) strategy increase use home dialysis patient end-stage renal disease . Informed careful survey work , clinic randomize knowledge translation intervention receive patient provider direct educational tool , include MATCH D tool , compel visual aid ( infographic , white board animate video , educational video dialysis modality option ) , audit feedback , in-person medical detailing . Control clinic continue usual practice respect dialysis modality education . Primary Objective To determine whether standardized modality education program direct patient , combination provider-directed intervention increase use home dialysis incident dialysis patient Canada Study Design : A cluster randomize trial CKD clinic across Canada compare efficacy safety KT intervention aim increase use home dialysis patient advance CKD . The unit observation patient ( i.e. , outcomes measure level individual patient ) , unit randomization level multidisciplinary CKD clinic . Team : The investigative study team include expert clinical epidemiology CKD kidney failure , local opinion leader every province/region , well expert knowledge translation cluster randomize design . As , investigator well position carry propose study . Research Significance : Home dialysis , comparison incenter hemodialysis , associate increase patient independence , good clinical outcome , low health care cost . Due variety factor , home dialysis use remain variable across Canada . This study test effectiveness KT strategy increase use home dialysis .</detailed_description>
