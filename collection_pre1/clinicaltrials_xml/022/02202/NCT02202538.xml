	<criteria>Be 18 year old Height 5 ' 1 '' 6 ' 3 '' ( Acceptable height may vary inch depend femur length ) . Hip width measure sit great 16.6 '' ( 42 cm ) ( acceptable hip width may vary depend soft tissue ) . Femur length measure sit must 14 inch ( 35.5cm ) 18.5 inch ( 47 cm ) Weight 250lbs ( 113.4 kg ) less Present Spinal Cord Injury NLI C5 low , ISNCSCI A , B , C D nonambulatory poorly ambulatory . There restriction time since injury . However , subject must sign medical clearance/approval full weight bear locomotor training . Determined sufficient bone health walk full weight bear without undue risk fracture . Meeting criterion discretion subject 's personal MD must approve site 's Medical PI . Passive range motion ( PROM ) shoulder , trunk , upper extremity low extremity within functional limit safe gait use appropriate assistive device/stability aid . Skin must intact interface robotic device Modified Ashworth Scale spasticity score must 3 less . Blood pressure heart rate within establish guideline locomotor training : At rest ; Systolic 150 less Diastolic 90 less Heart rate 105 less Exercise ; Systolic 180 less Diastolic 105 less Heart Rate 145 less Tolerate upright stand position ( passive active ) without lightheaded headache . Weight excess 250 lbs Heterotopic ossification , opinion investigator , would place subject undue risk fracture . Any subject deemed increase risk injury Medical Personnel Lower extremity joint limitation exceed 10 degree hip , knee ankle . Light headedness headache stand position ( active passive ) Moderate Severe Traumatic ( Acquired ) Brain Injury Inability follow instruction Colostomy bag Women pregnant attempt become pregnant study intervention . Unable obtain informed consent ( either subject subject Legally Authorized Representative ) . Any disease , concomitant injury , condition interferes performance interpretation protocol specify assessment Unlikely available followup phone call . Any issue , opinion investigator , make subject unsuitable study participation .</criteria>
