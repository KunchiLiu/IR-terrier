	<brief_title>Dovitinib Combination With Imatinib Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>combination dovitinib imatinib could lead additive synergistic effect patient failure standard TKI therapy include imatinib , sunitinib , and/or regorafenib . In phase I-II study dovitinib plus imatinib , aim determine recommend dose dovitinib plus imatinib evaluate safety activity combination recommend dose 3rd line treatment metastatic unresectable GIST .</detailed_description>
