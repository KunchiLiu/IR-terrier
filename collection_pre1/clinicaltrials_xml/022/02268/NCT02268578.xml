	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) powerful technique modulate brain activity : TDCS base application weak direct current scalp flow two relatively large electrodes—anode cathode . During tDCS , low amplitude ( 1-2 mA ) , constant current apply via scalp electrode penetrate skull enter brain . Although substantial shunt current scalp , sufficient current penetrates brain modify trans-membrane neuronal potential show two recent model study ( Miranda et al . 2006 ; Wagner et al . 2007a ) , thus influence level excitability modulate fire rate individual neuron . When tDCS apply sufficient duration , cortical function alter beyond stimulation period ( Nitsche Paulus 2001 ) direction cortical excitability change depend current orientation . Several well-conducted animal study effect tDCS date back 1950s 60 show tDCS powerful technique modulate brain function . These study demonstrate polarize current apply surface brain result modulation cortical activity . Surface anodal polarization cortex increase spontaneous unit discharge ( Burns 1954 ; Creutzfeld et al . 1962 ) initiate paroxysmal activity ( Goldring O'Leary 1951 ) , whereas cathodal polarization generally depress event . Furthermore , low-level surface polarization facilitate acquisition learn motor response induces prolong change pattern evoke cortical unit discharge ( Bindman et al . 1964 ) . Finally , Purpura et al . ( 1964 ) , study pyramidal tract cell cat , show prolonged period polarization may produce progressive membrane post-synaptic potential change well after-effects ( Purpura McMurtry 1965 ) . Based evidence , recent human study perform collectively show motor cortex ( M1 ) stimulation tDCS change motor cortex excitability depend stimulation polarity : anodal stimulation increase cortical excitability , cathodal stimulation decrease ( Nitsche et al . 2003 ; Nitsche Paulus 2000 ; Nitsche Paulus 2001 ) . Similar modulatory effect also describe visual cortex ( Antal et al . 2004 ; Antal et al . 2001 ) . A recent tDCS study show anodal tDCS primary motor cortex affect cortical activity , induce significant change thalamic activity ( Lang et al . 2005 ) . It note application tDCS human advance significantly last 10 year therefore different human application use '60s '70s ( Wagner et al . 2007b ) Furthermore , tDCS offer several advantage compare technique noninvasive brain stimulation ( i.e. , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) ) : ( 1 ) small size electrode stimulator , thus allow portable use instance use home , ( 2 ) simple non-expensive technique easily translate use clinical practice , ( 3 ) long-lasting effect - modulatory effect tDCS last long compare rTMS - instance , 13 minute stimulation change brain excitability 2 hour ( Nitsche Paulus 2001 ) , ( 4 ) easily blind sham tDCS set clinical trial ( Gandiga et al 2006 ) Prefrontal stimulation show enhance cognitive function : There several recently publish study demonstrate enhancement work memory tDCS stimulation apply dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex . Fregni et al ( 2005 ) study 15 normal subject . The patient perform three -back work memory task active anodal ( stimulatory ) tDCS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( left DLPFC ) , sham stimulation leave DLPFC , cathodal ( inhibitory ) stimulation leave DLPFC , anodal stimulation primary motor cortex ( M1 ) . The result study show significant improvement work memory indexed task accuracy active anodal tDCS leave DLPFC . The condition stimulation—including sham tDCS , anodal tDCS leave DLPFC , anodal tDCS M1—did result significant task performance change . Similarly , Boggio et al ( 2007 ) also find significant improvement affective go-no-go task performance patient severe depression treatment anodal tDCS leave DLPFC independent degree mood enhancement 10 consecutive day tDCS . Conversely , evidence cathodal inhibition right DLPFC enhance work memory performance task depress patient ( Bermpohl et al 2006 ) . Together study suggest increase activity leave DLPFC—whether directly anodal stimulation indirectly cathodal inhibition right DLPFC—is responsible improvement work memory performance . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) significant antidepressant effect : Modulation prefrontal cortex anodal tDCS associate significant improvement depression . Initially preliminary , randomize , control double blind trial effect five day anodal stimulation leave DLPFC 10 patient major depression investigate . All patient tolerate tDCS without complication . At end treatment , 4 treatment responder active group versus responder sham group . The patient receive active stimulation significant decrease Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) score compare baseline observe patient receive sham stimulation ( Fregni et al . 2006b ) . In follow-up , parallel-group , double-blind clinical trial 40 patient major depression , patient washed-out medication randomize three group treatment : anodal tDCS leave DLPFC ( active group ) ; anodal tDCS occipital cortex ( active control group ) sham tDCS ( placebo control group ) . tDCS apply 10 session 2-week period . Mood evaluate blind rater use HDRS BDI . The treatment well tolerate minimal side effect distribute equally across treatment group . This study show significantly large reduction depression score leave DLPFC tDCS ( HDRS reduction 40.4 % ( ±25.8 % ) ) compare occipital ( HDRS reduction 21.3 % ( ±12.9 % ) ) sham tDCS ( HDRS reduction 10.4 % ( ±36.6 % ) ) . The beneficial effect tDCS DLPFC group persist 1 month end treatment ( Boggio et al . 2008 ) . Similarly , another longitudinal study depression Rigonatti et al ( 2008 ) , serial application anodal ( stimulatory ) tDCS apply prefrontal cortex ( 10 session 2 mA ) similar effect reduce depressive symptom measure Beck Depression Inventory score fluoxetine even 6 week treatment . However , effect tDCS immediate fluoxetine19 . In summary , tDCS leave DLPFC seem able induce significant positive affective cognitive improvement normal patient patient significant depression . We therefore proposal test whether prolonged prefrontal stimulation associate clinically meaningful change affective cognitive function without worsen epileptiform activity seizure frequency . The result pilot study significant clinical impact treatment neuropsychiatric comorbidities patient temporal lobe epilepsy .</detailed_description>
