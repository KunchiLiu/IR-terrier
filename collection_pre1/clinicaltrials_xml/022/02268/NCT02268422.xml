	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Adhesion Comparison Buprenorphine Patches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective compare 2nd generation BTDS patch 20 µg/h 1st generation patch confirm bioequivalence . Determination via measurement drug concentration blood serial collection time point pre-dose 288 hour post-patch application . Approximately 100 healthy male female volunteer receive BTDS patch across two study period 14-day wash-out application . Each patch wear 7 consecutive day study also review adhesion patch skin subject . The overall safety tolerability patch assess .</detailed_description>
