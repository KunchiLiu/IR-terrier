	<brief_title>Explore Transplant Home : Improving Low-Income ESRD Patients ' Transplant Knowledge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nationwide , almost 600,000 patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , kidney failure . There two option ESRD patient sustain life : dialysis , machine filter waste blood , kidney transplant decease live donor . Kidney transplantation , especially live donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) , offer ESRD patient 3 17 additional year life improve quality-of-life compare remain dialysis . However , majority ESRD patients- 415,000 2009 - still remain dialysis . Although dialysis life-saving , replace 10-15 % normal kidney function lead cardiovascular disease , infection , complication . Dialysis treatment also take 12 15 hour per week , require many patient stop work go disability . The chance dialysis patient alive 5 year without transplant 38 % . A complex set potential risk benefit need consider decide whether get LDKT , particularly low-income dialysis patient face significant practical financial barrier transplant . Established chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) Centers Medicaid Medicare Services ( CMS ) guideline recommend dialysis patient educate different treatment option , medical risk involve , advantage transplant make inform transplant decision . Since transplant within first six month begin dialysis result best health outcome , one Healthy People 2020 proposed goal , `` Increase proportion dialysis patient wait-listed and/or receiving decease donor kidney transplant within one year ESRD start ( among patient 70 year age ) '' . Unfortunately , research show many patient dialysis center inconsistently educate LDKT , particularly patient socioeconomically disadvantage member racial/ethnic minority group . Through previous HRSA grant , Dr. Waterman design Explore Transplant ( ET ) education program base Prochaska 's Transtheoretical Model Behavioral Change research 1000 patient kidney disease address key gaps patient ' transplant knowledge . The mission ET transplant-eligible patient explore option transplant make informed choice know benefit risk . Through group randomize control trial ( GRCT ) , early version ET , deliver face-to-face patient undergoing dialysis , show increase patient ' knowledge inform decision-making . As result , Explore Transplant program 2009 National Association Transplant Professionals ( NATCO ) Quality Care Award . However , additional research explore dialysis provider ' ability integrate ET patient care find multiple patient , provider , system barrier limit accomplish educationally within dialysis center . With dialysis provider report limited time educate patient , comprehensive case-management program external organization may need supplement inconsistent transplant education provide within dialysis center . Thus , grant , investigator propose test effectiveness another replicable transferable solution disseminate ET transplant education nationally patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) Stages 3-5 : Partnering large health insurance organization provide transplant education support telephone mail . The important research question require study whether dissemination strategy also promote great transplant knowledge patient , particularly vulnerable patient least likely receive comprehensive transplant education dialysis center . For grant , investigator choose re-partner organization investigator previous success conduct transplant education trial , Missouri Kidney Program ( MoKP ) . Since MoKP subsidize cost dialysis transplant medication low-income ESRD patient Missouri , operate insurance company would respect 1200-patient member group . MoKP also natural ally underserved group kidney patient focus educate comprehensively DDKT LDKT without compete job responsibility . Finally , strong , statewide partnership every dialysis center Missouri , permission communicate social worker need , transplant education need care specific dialysis patient . Therefore , partnership MoKP , grant team conduct group randomize control trial ( GRCT ) 540 low-income dialysis patient order ass establish , video-guided transplant education program , Explore Transplant , could incorporate within centralized health care organization 's delivery transplant education . The investigator conduct eight-month educational intervention patient randomize receive : ( 1 ) additional education provide within dialysis center ; ( 2 ) video-guided , four-part ET program deliver via internet mail ; ( 3 ) video-guided , four-part ET program discussion facilitate Transplant Educator via telephone . The investigator expect 20 % attrition time final sample 430 Black White patient . The investigator also conduct considerable formative work ass unique difficulty face Black White low-income patient learn transplant online telephone . The grant aim : Aim 1 : To understand transplant educational need barrier learn face low-income Black White ESRD patient . Aim 2 : Compared standard-of-care dialysis center education , conduct GRCT ass effectiveness patient-guided case-manager-guided ET education improve low-income patient ' DDKT LDKT knowledge inform LDKT decision-making . Aim 3 : To examine patient characteristic quality dialysis center transplant education act alone combination ET educational program</detailed_description>
