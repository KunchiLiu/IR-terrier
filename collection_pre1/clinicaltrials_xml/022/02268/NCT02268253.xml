	<brief_summary>This non-randomized open label multi-center study . Patients high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasm ( systemic mastocytosis [ SM ] , advance symptomatic hypereosinoophic disorder [ PED ] , myelofibrosis [ MF ] , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [ CMML ] ) treat SL-401 , administer brief intravenous infusion 3 consecutive day initially every 21 day 4 cycle ; every 28 day cycle 5-7 ; every 42 day . Stage 1 consist period several dos SL-401 evaluate . The Stage 2 portion enroll 18 patient 4 myeloproliferative malignancy : SM , PED , MF , CMML . In entirety , Stage 2 portion consist 72 patient treated maximum tolerate dose maximum test dose multiple dose-limiting toxicity observe ( identify Stage 1 ) .</brief_summary>
