	<brief_summary>This pilot study design investigate effectiveness nMARQ Pulmonary Vein Isolation system treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) different ablation setting . AF common condition cause fast erratic heartbeat . There estimate 50,000 new case diagnose per year UK . The fast heart beat cause symptom palpitation , lightheadedness , chest pain , shortness breath fatigue . Catheter ablation technique use control AF . In procedure catheter ( long thin wire ) pass chamber heart via large blood vessel leg . The tip catheter destroy tiny section heart tissue may source trigger abnormal electrical impulse . One challenge AF ablation maximize success rate , currently rapid advance technology carry procedure . Different catheter exist deliver energy different way . This study use one system perform procedure . It call nMARQ system Pulmonary Vein Isolation produce Biosense Webster . Currently system use practice UK patient medical condition . What seek research ablate optimum set perform ablation . There currently data guide best clinical practice area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study design investigate use nMARQ Pulmonary Vein Isolation system treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) different ablation setting . At least one month prior ablation procedure , Implanted Loop Recorder ( ILR ) ( REVEAL XT ) implant patient robust , continuous , long term monitoring burden arrhythmia follow case . It decide use continuous implant rhythm monitor allow robust complete data capture arrhythmia recurrence burden little impact patient implantation . These increasingly use follow patient undergo AF ablation . They give continuous data feed show presence quantity abnormal rhythm see ablation . Their use approve follow AF ablation procedure within recent consensus guideline formulate American College Cardiology , American Heart Association , European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society , European Heart Rhythm Association , Society Thoracic Surgeons , Heart Rhythm Society . There several paper show validation data collect REVEAL XT ILR benefit continuous monitoring versus conventional method intermittent ambulatory ECGs . The setting choose ablation guide preclinical data collect Biosense Webster also settings use clinically worldwide utilise system . It decide two two study design vary wattage 20W 25W also vary time period per lesion 20 second 40 second . We feel project carry pilot study potentially inform research . There little clinical data publish best use device . At present leave individual clinician form `` best practise '' choose ablation setting . We seek formalise potential ablation variable structure format allow comparison draw end study form basis future research . Following current pathway , patient admit 24 hour prior treatment , standard , test ( include Echo TOE pregnancy test ) Í¾ point patient randomise one arm trial , equal 1:1:1:1 ratio . As study ' unblinded ' procedure constitute standard care NHS , would point participant Consultant time discuss impact set participant randomise , thereby reduce anxiety day procedure . The following day , procedure would carry accord standard treatment follow national guideline use one ablation presets per randomisation . Within UK standard practice follow-up visit 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month . At visit , addition standard test , patient Consultant would complete questionnaire . After one year patient attend removal ILR unless deem clinical use . Recruitment Consent Our target population patient would routinely catheter ablation AF . They kind AF come go troubled symptomatically . This research study construct around patient ' normal care pathway , minimise need additional visit activity . Risks , burden benefit Potential risk burden participation study centre use ILR rhythm record ablation procedure . This device small implantation minor day case procedure do local anaesthetic . The risk implantation small . Its use follow AF ablation endorse international clinical guideline back scientific data . The use ILR AF ablation become commonplace anything constrained financial issue NHS rather ethical consideration risk burden implantation . Potential benefit participant also involve ILR . By continuous monitor heart rhythm ablation consultant information guide clinical management decision make ablation occurs . In clinical practise , without ILR place , patient would otherwise undergo number ambulatory ECG monitor periodically throughout follow period</detailed_description>
