	<brief_summary>The purpose study find increase potential achieve `` operational cure '' chronic myeloid leukemia . An `` operational cure '' state person require treatment , although may remain cancer cell . Patients would normally remain TK inhibitor indefinitely within standard care set chronic myeloid leukemia . Within clinical trial , patient discontinue TK inhibitor prematurely . If sign progression identify , dasatinib introduce . This research do dasatinib show achieve great response much high proportion patient compare imatinib . Dasatinib approximately 300 time potent imatinib , possible great response achieve dasatinib imatinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment-free Remission Accomplished With Dasatinib Patients With CML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single arm Phase II trial examine safe effective patient chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) discontinue first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy . The main goal study determine potential role dasatinib ( study drug ) help patient CML attain sustained treatment free remission . During study safety tolerability Dasatinib evaluate mean drug relate toxicity , adverse event report , physical examination laboratory safety evaluation . The study period individual patient expect approximately 30-72 month . A total 135 patient recruit 10 Canadian centre .</detailed_description>
