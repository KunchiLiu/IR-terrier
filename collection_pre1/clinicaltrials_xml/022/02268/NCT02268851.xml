	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate safety efficacy study drug call TGR-1202 combination know drug ibrutinib , also know Imbruvica , possible treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) come back responded standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/Ib Safety Efficacy Study PI3K-delta Inhibitor TGR-1202 Ibrutinib Patients With CLL MCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I Ib combination clinical trial , aim evaluate safety investigational drug combination also try define appropriate dose investigational drug evaluate later clinical trial . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve TGR-1202 United States use MCL/CLL/SLL cancer . TGR-1202 newly develop drug may stop cancer cell grow base recent laboratory experiment . The result experiment suggest drug may help kill cancer cell couple ibrutinib . In research study , safety tolerability TGR-1202 investigate determine high dose safely used combination ibrutinib . The study also aim evaluate whether TGR-1202 effect tumor growth ( nodal response ) , determine overall repsonse rate duration response patient CLL/SLL MCL</detailed_description>
