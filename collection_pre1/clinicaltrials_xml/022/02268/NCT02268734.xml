	<brief_title>Molecular Profile Metastatic Sporadic Medullary Thyroid Cancer Patients Correlation With Vandetanib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) consider worldwide rare cancer . It derive parafolicular C-cells represent 5-10 % thyroid cancer . MTC diagnose sporadic form ( sMTC ) patient , although 20-30 % case could hereditary transmit autosomal-dominant trait due germline mutation RET proto-oncogene . RET tyrosine kinase receptor involve regulation differentiation , proliferation , survival cell motility process several intracellular signalling pathway , include MAPK PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway . Vandetanib approve patient unresectable and/or metastatic MTC Food Drug Administration , European Medicines Agency , recently , license also Italian Regulatory Agency ( AIFA ) use Italy . Vandetanib orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , RET signal . In randomized phase III trial , response rate vandetanib range 31 % 55 % predicted median progression-free survival ( PFS ) 30.5 month data overall survival still available time publication . These result suggest approximately half patient could benefit compound whose activity every case limited time . Activity vandetanib seem influenced several factor , include RET mutational status tumor genetic heterogeneity ( clonal versus non-clonal RET mutation distribution ) . Recent analysis circulate miRNAs tumor patient suggest miRNA signature may useful diagnostic/prognostic/predictive well pharmacodynamic marker several tumor type . No clinical neither biological data currently available identify patient could really get benefit TKI . In word , metastatic patient could suffer indolent disease , require TKI upfront date , still able identify select group patient Circulating miRNAs level could influence treatment procedure , describe lung cancer miR-21 miR-24 result significantly low post-operative period respect pre-operative one pair sample . We hypothesize TKI therapy could influence level circulate miRNAs well . Aim project seek non-invasive molecular marker potentially useful prognostic tool metastatic MTC patient .</detailed_description>
