	<brief_summary>An open-label , multi-part , first-in-human study oral LMI070 infant Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) efficacy 13 week ; estimate Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) optimal dose regimen orally administer LMI070 patient Type 1 SMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Study LMI070 Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-part , first-in-human , proof concept study infant Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy exactly 2 copy SMN2 , evaluate safety , tolerability , PK , PD efficacy oral LMI070 13 week treatment . Parts 1 2 intend non-confirmatory . In Part 1 study , patient dose weekly LMI070 . The LMI070 dose escalate subsequent cohort MTD determine sufficient PK result confirm MTD reach due potential pharmacokinetic plateau high dos . A decision dose escalate next cohort make safety data collect 14 day follow first dose ( 14-day DLT window ) . PK use confirm accumulation compound . Part 2 study enroll new patient one 3 dosing regimen ( depend result Part 1 ) 12 week . Patients complete first 13 week Part 1 , opinion Investigator Sponsor benefit and/or tolerate LMI070 , may continue treatment high dos LMI070 show well tolerate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must obtain parent / guardian assessment perform . Type 1 SMA , diagnose clinically , symptom onset &lt; 6 month age genetic confirmation mutation alleles SMN1 gene , SMN2 copy number 2 . Best supportive care place stable least 14 day screen . Age screen 1 7 month Must able demonstrate antigravity strength biceps . Must agree placement feed tube enteral access via nasogastric ( NG ) , nasojejunal ( NJ ) , percutaneous gastrostomy ( PEG ) , percutaneous jejunostomy ( PEJ ) tube dose LMI070 ( Part 1 patient administer orally ; tube may remove dos ) . At birth gestational age &gt; 32 week body weight birth &gt; 2 kg . Must live within 2 hour drive study center . Clearance obtain site investigator sponsor patient reside 2 hour ground travel study center Able complete study procedure , measurement visit ; parent guardian/subject adequately supportive psychosocial circumstance , opinion Site Investigator . Use investigational drug within 14 day . Neurologic , neuromuscular condition SMA . Anemia , leukopenia , neutropenia thrombocytopenia Hepatic dysfunction Age adjust renal dysfunction Clinically significant abnormality hematology clinical chemistry parameter , assess Site Investigator , screen would render subject unsuitable inclusion Intractable seizure disorder ( inactive febrile seizure ) . Persistent ( opinion Investigator ) hypoxemia ( O2 saturation awake &lt; 92 % O2 saturation asleep &lt; 91 % , without ventilation support ) require oral suction &gt; 2 per day , presence tracheostomy . Presence untreated inadequately treat active infection require systemic antiviral antimicrobial therapy time screen period . Current diagnosis cardiac and/or vascular abnormality ECG abnormality ( long QT , heart block Torsade 's ) indicating significant risk safety infant patient participate study : Concomitant clinically significant pediatric cardiac arrhythmia , e.g . sustain ventricular tachycardia , clinically significant second third degree AV block Prohibited Concomitant Medications Excluding SMA , medically unstable condition include cardiomyopathy , hepatic dysfunction , kidney disorder , endocrine disorder , GI disorder , prematurity &lt; 32 week gestation , metabolic disorder , severe respiratory compromise significant brain abnormality injuries include hypoxicischemic encephalopathy . Acute ongoing medical condition , accord Site Investigator discuss sponsor , would interfere conduct assessment study . Examples medical disability SMA would interfere assessment safety would compromise ability subject undergo study procedure include assess CHOP INTEND motor scale , change hematologic parameter gastrointestinal dysfunction would compromise ability adequate assessment safety .</criteria>
