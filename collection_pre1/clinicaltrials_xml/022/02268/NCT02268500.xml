	<brief_title>VAccination Improve Clinical outComes Heart Failure Trial : Feasibility Study ( VACC-HeFT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goal : This randomize , double blind , active-control trial high dose influenza vaccine compare standard dose influenza vaccine one season adult participant symptomatic heart failure . The primary outcome measure humoral ( antibody-mediated ) immune response , secondary outcome include cumulative incidence influenza-like illness symptom cause hospitalization . The aim gather information feasibility study design effect size difference inform large outcomes-based clinical trial . Background : The 5.8 million Individuals US heart failure ( HF ) high risk influenza infection associate morbidity , mortality increase health care cost despite annual influenza vaccination . Higher dose vaccine approve use old adult . Antibody-mediated immunity contribute vaccine-induced protection influenza illness . Preliminary data : Our research group UW Madison demonstrate reduce antibody titer influenza vaccination patient HF . Additionally , 've show pilot study double dose influenza vaccine result increased titer well tolerate . Methods : A multi-center , prospective , randomize , open-label blinded-endpoint trial conduct 20 patient assigned standard dose vaccine dose 20 patient high dose influenza vaccine . The primary outcome measure rate seroconversion ( 4-fold rise antibody titer A/H3N2 , A/H1N1 , B-type vaccine antigen ) , assess 4 week post vaccination . The study also examine feasibility difference symptoms influenza all-cause hospitalization vaccine dose group , data use plan subsequent outcomes-based clinical trial .</detailed_description>
