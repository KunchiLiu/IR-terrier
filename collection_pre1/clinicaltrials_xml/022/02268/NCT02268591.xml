	<detailed_description>Epilepsy cognitive dysfunction Recent investigation suggest 60 % patient epilepsy suffer cognitive impairment , memory , attentional executive dysfunction ( Elger et al. , 2004 , Lin et al. , 2012 ) . The severity profile cognitive impairment heterogeneous depend epilepsy syndrome , age onset , seizure control , frequency interictal activity , structural brain abnormality , antiepileptic medication use ( Elger et al. , 2004 , Helmstaedter Witt , 2012 , Zeman et al. , 2012 ) . Impairment declarative memory common cognitive complaint patient temporal lobe epilepsy localization-related epilepsy ( Oyegbile et al. , 2004 , Hoppe et al. , 2007 , Helmstaedter Witt , 2012 ) . Three type memory deficit associate epilepsy described : transient epileptic amnesia , accelerate long-term forgetting remote memory loss ( Butler Zeman , 2008 , Zeman et al. , 2012 ) . In particular , accelerate long-term forget - define difficulty retain memory initially able acquire - recently report prevalent previously recognize ( Witt et al. , 2012 ) . Current therapeutic approach include management antiepileptic drug , monitor side- effect , decrease seizure interictal frequency . However , even optimize , treatment show limited effectiveness modulate underlie pathophysiology ( Meador , 2011 , Lin et al. , 2012 ) . Indeed , despite prevalence cognitive comorbidity among epilepsy patient , effective therapy exist . Sleep-related memory consolidation There two major step learn : 1 ) attend encode information 2 ) stabilize consolidate transiently cod information ( Squire , 1992 ) . These step involve different physiological mechanism , different brain state different type interaction among hippocampal-neocortical circuit . Acquiring new information affect either acquisition consolidation phase . Therefore , strategy enhance memory formation target either step . Sleep , increasingly recognize critical role memory consolidation , provide intriguing opportunity therapeutic intervention . Memory consolidation , second stage learn process , activity transform short-term memory trace stable long-term representation ( Dudai , 2012 ) . One predominant view consolidation occur via hippocampal-neocortical interaction brain 's 'offline ' state sleep ( Buzsaki , 1989 ; Diekelmann Born , 2010 ) . The key electrophysiological pattern responsible interaction hippocampal sharp wave ripple ( SPW-R ) , spatio-temporal pattern neuronal firing associate precede learn replay compressed time scale ( O'Neill et al. , 2010 ) . Learning affect incidence neuronal content SPW-Rs subsequent sleep . Conversely , modification SPW-Rs various mean affect consolidation process . For example , selective elimination SPW-Rs rodent impair learn dramatically surgical removal hippocampus , even though experimental manipulation leave aspect post-learning sleep unaltered ( Girardeau et al. , 2009 ) . In addition SPW-Rs , two SWS-related oscillation implicate memory consolidation : amplitude coherence slow oscillation sleep spindle density increase SWS precede hippocampally-dependent declarative memory task ( Gais et al. , 2002 , Molle et al. , 2004 ) procedural skill learn ( Huber et al. , 2004 ) . SPW-Rs modulated sleep spindle ( 12-16 Hz ) , turn orchestrate slow ( 0.5-1.5 Hz ) ultraslow ( 0.1 Hz ) oscillation ( Steriade 1993 , Sirota 2003 , Isomura 2006 , Molle 2006 , Sullivan 2011 ) . Such cross-frequency coupling suggest complex distribute neuronal system coordinate neocortical-entorhinal cortex ( EC ) -hippocampal activity . Recently , demonstrate low frequency ( 0.01 - 0.1 Hz ) blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI correlation enhance post-encoding waking rest period relative baseline rest period inclusion form learn 7-11 . Furthermore , demonstrate , across participant , magnitude change hippocampal-cortical rest connectivity relate subsequent associative memory performance 10 . These spatial temporal relationship provide remarkable opportunity influence hippocampal activity , thereby memory consolidation , affect neocortical slow oscillation and/or thalamocortical sleep spindle ( Ozen et al. , 2010 ) . Specifically , cortical rhythm bias non-invasive stimulation behavioral intervention , thereby potentially enhance interfere learn . Indeed , several study demonstrate SWS-related electrical pattern enhance healthy subject non-invasive brain stimulation technique , TCS , apply early sleep ( Marshall et al. , 2004 , Marshall et al. , 2006 , Massimini et al. , 2007 ) . Specifically , low delta frequency ( 0.75 Hz ) TCS early SWS sleep increase endogenous oscillation post-sleep gain word-pair association memory , hippocampal-dependent declarative memory task ( Marshall et al. , 2006 , Marshall et al. , 2011 ) . Modulation SWS , via TCS , may enhance learn outcome across range cognitive domains patient epilepsy neurologic disorder . TCS : Background safety issue . TCS method noninvasive brain stimulation delivers low amplitude current scalp electrode . Current parameter may alter deliver current unidirectional [ ie . transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) ] , alternate [ ie . transcranial alternate current stimulation ( TACS ) ] , random manner [ ie . transcranial random noise stimulation ( TRNS ) ] , affect endogenous brain oscillation different direction . Decades research human animal model show TCS modulate brain activity - enhance reduce cortical excitability ( review Priori , 2003 ) . Advantages TCS include low cost , ease administration , safety profile , noninvasive painless nature . TCS base application weak direct current scalp . Low amplitude ( &lt; 2 mA ) current apply via scalp electrode penetrate skull enter brain . Although substantial shunt current scalp , sufficient current penetrates brain modify trans-membrane neuronal potential show two recent model study ( Miranda et al. , 2006 , Wagner et al. , 2007 ) , thus , influence level excitability modulate fire rate individual neuron . When TCS apply sufficient duration , cortical function alter beyond stimulation period ( Nitsche Paulus , 2001 ) direction cortical excitability change depend current orientation . Several well-conducted animal study effect TCS date back 1950s 60 demonstrate ability modulate brain function . These study demonstrate polarize current apply surface brain result modulation cortical activity . Surface anodal polarization cortex increase spontaneous unit discharge ( Burns , 1954 , Creutzfeldt et al. , 1962 ) initiate paroxysmal activity ( Goldring O'Leary , 1951 ) , whereas cathodal polarization generally depress event . Low-level surface polarization also show facilitate acquisition learn motor response induce prolong change pattern evoke cortical unit discharge ( Bindman et al. , 1964 ) . Furthermore , Purpura et al . ( 1965 ) , study pyramidal tract cell cat , show prolonged period polarization may produce progressive membrane post-synaptic potential change well after-effects ( Purpura McMurtry , 1965 ) . More recently , extracellular intracellular study rat show TCS reliably entrain neuron widespread cortical area , include hippocampus ( Ozen et al , 2010 ) . TCS offer several advantage compare technique noninvasive brain stimulation , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . These include : ( 1 ) small size electrode stimulator , thus allow portable use , ( 2 ) simple non-expensive technique easily translate use clinical practice , ( 3 ) durable effect - modulatory effect TCS last longer compare rTMS [ e.g. , 13 minute TDCS change brain excitability 2 hour ( Nitsche Paulus , 2001 ) ] , ( 4 ) easily blind set clinical trial ( Gandiga et al. , 2006 ) , ( 5 ) well-established safety profile ( Liebetanz et al. , 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
