	<detailed_description>An ongoing debate , long-running treatment antidepressant , delay response drug . Antidepressant drug take 2 4 week produce treatment response effect ( least 50 % improvement depressive symptom versus baseline level ) . This delay antidepressant response prove highly problematic since , interim period , patient expose suffering , debilitative effect , direct indirect cost risk associated major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Another important issue define failure therapeutic trial change treatment . Between 30 50 % MDD patient fail respond adequate first-line treatment . If favorable outcome define full remission ( opposed 50 % improvement ) patient , failure rate first trial great still . Some review recommend dose adjustment every two week 4-8 week wait treatment change poor response . Despite recommendation , question change treatment strategy warrant debate . Early improvement antidepressant treatment desirable reduces suffer , loss cost associate MDD . In addition , risk suicidal ideation commit suicide reduce patient present early improvement depressive symptom . However , early improvement reduces risk also predict outcome end acute phase treatment . A number study investigate different antidepressant show presence early response good predictor favorable outcome end acute phase treatment ( 6 8 week treatment ) . A meta-analysis review 41 simple double-blind clinical trial include total 6562 patient . Early improvement , define 20 % reduction score Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAMD-17 ) within 2 week , associate sustained response , remission ( define HAM-D-17 score ≤7 ) . While early response amply demonstrate numerous clinical trial , gap knowledge subject . Scant study document whether difference pattern early improvement among different antidepressant . Similarly , dearth study analyze whether presence otherwise early response predictive value different antidepressant . Another little explored aspect arbitrary nature criterion define onset improvement , early improvement , treatment response symptomatological remission . Studies tend reproduce previously-adopted criterion without elaborate exploratory analysis justify cut-off point adopt . The aim present study ass presence early improvement one two week treatment sertraline . Besides assess presence early response , study include exploratory analysis assess positive negative predictive value , sensitivity specificity early improvement predictor sustain response remission 6 , 8 24 week treatment .</detailed_description>
