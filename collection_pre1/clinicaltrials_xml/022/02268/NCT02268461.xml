	<brief_summary>Spasticity common complication stroke affect quality life . Spasticity involve exaggerated stretch reflex create stiffness muscle associate loss motion functional control . Traditional treatment involve range motion , medication , sometimes surgery . Each limitation , invite exploration alternative mode treatment . One treatment potential benefit spasticity repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . The purpose study determine whether patient upper limb spasticity consequence chronic stroke benefit stimulation non-affected hemisphere brain low-frequency ( inhibitory ) repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) , potentially lead reduction spasticity clinical improvement upper limb function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Post-Stroke Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study evaluate efficacy rTMS versus placebo spasticity reduction cross-over design 6 people stroke . Our research question : In patient upper extremity spasticity consequence chronic stroke , stimulation contralesional motor cortex low-frequency ( inhibitory ) rTMS lead reduction spasticity thereby clinical improvement upper extremity function ? Our rationale pathophysiology post-stroke spasticity primarily drive ensuant cortical derangement , , derangement mitigate clinically meaningful extent proper utilization rTMS direct focus . Optimized rTMS treatment protocol may even achieve efficacy surpasses current mainstay spasticity management . Patients randomly assign receive either rTMS placebo first treatment arm cross-over receive opposite treatment second treatment arm . A washout period one month occur treatment arm . Each treatment arm consist 3 daily treatment session . Participants present Monday pre-test assessment , Tuesday-Thursday treatment session Friday post-test assessment . One treatment session consist 600 pulse 1Hertz rTMS intensity 90 % rest motor threshold ( duration 10 minute ) apply primary motor area contralesional hemisphere . Sham rTMS intensity 0 % similar sound scalp sensation . Assessments make session , conduct pre-test , post-test , one-month follow-up . The one month follow-up test serve pretest next treatment arm . That , follow-up , patient cross-over receive opposite treatment format . Safety already demonstrate protocol . Data analyze method appropriate single-subject crossover design ( visual analysis , confidence interval 2-Standard Deviation bandwidth ) . The primary outcome measure reduction spasticity finger wrist . A secondary outcome interest functional improvement spastic upper limb .</detailed_description>
