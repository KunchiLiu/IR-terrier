	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy new docetaxel-cisplatin-cetuximab regimen ( TPEx ) versus standard platinum-5FU-cetuximab EXTREME regimen first-line treatment recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC . Half patient treat TPEx regimen , half treat EXTREME regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platinum-Cetuximab Combined With Docetaxel With 5FU Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EXTREME regimen , i.e . cetuximab add platinum ( 100 mg/m² every 3 week ) 5FU ( 96h continuous infusion 1000 mg/m²/day every 3 week ) 6 cycle treatment continue maintenance patient stable disease , currently standard care first line recurrent metastatic HNSCC . From previous experience ( phase II GORTEC `` TPEx '' study ) , TPEx regimen 4 cycle docetaxel-cisplatin-cetuximab follow maintenance cetuximab every 2 week seem efficient ( overall survival ) compare EXTREME regiment . Docetaxel combine cisplatine ( administer 75mg/m² every 3 week ) also appear convenient standard Cisplatin-5FU-Cetuximab EXTREME regimen ( 4 cycle chemotherapy instead 6 cycle i.v . continuous infusion ) . Toxicity manageable G-CSF support . In addition toxicity / efficacy profile also seem favourable suggest excellent dose intensity achieve high rate patient ( 78 % ) able start maintenance therapy . Taking together consideration , TPEx regimen might good substitute EXTREME first-line treatment patient recurrent metastatic HNSCC , justify necessary perform direct comparison randomize trial test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
