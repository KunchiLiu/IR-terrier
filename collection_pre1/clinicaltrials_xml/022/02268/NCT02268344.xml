	<brief_summary>Introduction : Shoulder pain dysfunction common oncologic neck dissection head neck cancer ( HNC ) . These symptom hinder postoperative rehabilitation oral hygiene , activity daily live ( ADLs ) , return work treatment . Due rise incidence Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -associated oropharyngeal cancer , patient often diagnose 3rd 4th decade life , leave many potential work year lose . Brief electrical stimulation ( BES ) novel technique show enhance neuronal regeneration injury brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor ( BDNF ) -driven molecular pathway . The aim study examine utility intraoperative BES prevention shoulder pain dysfunction oncologic neck dissection . Methods : All adult patient new diagnosis HNC undergoing surgery neck dissection include Level IIb postoperative radiotherapy enrol . Patients undergo intraoperative BES completion neck dissection 60 minute continuously 20 Hz intensity 1.5 time motor threshold . Postoperatively , patient evaluate use Constant-Murley Shoulder Score , scale ass shoulder pain , activity daily live ( ADLs ) , strength , range motion . Secondary outcome measure include score Oxford Shoulder Score , Neck Dissection Impairment Index ( NDII ) , University Washington Quality Life ( UW-QOL ) score . Primary secondary outcome assess 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month postoperatively . Study placebo group compare use Mann-Whitney analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial . Two parallel treatment group examine 1:1 allocation : 1 ) brief intraoperative electrical stimulation continuously 20 Hz intensity 1.5 time motor threshold 60 minute , 2 ) sham/no stimulation 60 minute . Individuals allocate treatment group use block randomization sequence . Participants researcher measure outcomes blind treatment group . Stimulation ( BES sham ) occur intraoperatively immediately follow neck dissection 60 minute .</detailed_description>
