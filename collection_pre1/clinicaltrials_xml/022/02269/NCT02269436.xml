	<brief_title>A follow-on Study Assess Long-term Safety Tolerability i.c.v Administration sNN0029 Patients With ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , follow-on phase 1 study assess long-term safety tolerability continuous i.c.v administration sNN0029 infusion solution patient ALS . Eighteen patient previously participate study sNN0029-003 receive continuous administration 4 μg sNN0029/day via i.c.v . infusion Medtronic SynchroMed® II Infusion System . The sNN0029 infusion solution intend add-on treatment treatment ALS . The assessment perform last visit study sNN0029-003 serve baseline value patient include study sNN0029-004 start sNN0029 treatment patient ( Study Day 1 ; Visit 1 ) . In order reveal blind study sNN0029-003 , patient return hospital Day 3 stay Day 6 ( Visit 2 ) . During day , sNN0029 begin exit i.c.v . catheter tip ventricle brain . Patients return hospital Day 11 ( Visit 3 ) refill sNN0029 adjustment infusion pump flow rate . After , patient return clinic Day 39 ( Visit 4 ) sNN0029-refill infusion pump assessment . Thereafter patient visit hospital monthly basis ( every 28 day ± 2 ) perform refill make assessment every 3 month . Treatment study sNN0029-004 may continue unless safety concern warrant discontinuation therapy , patient choose withdraw study , experience treatment related toxicity intolerance , deem unsuitable continue treatment investigator , die</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Previous participation sNN0029003 completion 12 week study without clinically significant safety concern 2 . Intact continuity Medtronic SynchroMed® II Infusion System judge Xray head abdominal area 3 . Clinical diagnosis ALS classify definite , probable without additional laboratory evidence , accord revise WFN El Escorial criterion 4 . Patient give write verbal information continuation study , opportunity ask question study , understands time procedural commitment 5 . Patient give oral / sign consent ( write ) participate study . In event patient give oral informed consent physically able sign inform consent form ( ICF ) due disease progression , witness may sign informed consent form patient 's behalf 1 . Hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg systolic &gt; 90 mmHg diastolic 2 . Ophthalmological examination ( fundus photography , visual acuity perimetry ) clinically significant finding imply safety concern study . 3 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus 4 . Presence risk increase uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk bleed manage optimally due : Anatomical factor near implant site ( e.g. , vascular abnormality , neoplasm , abnormality ) Underlying disorder coagulation cascade , platelet function , platelet count ( e.g. , haemophilia , Von Willebrand 's disease , liver disease , medical condition ) 5 . Presence additional risk factor thromboembolism obesity ( Body mass index [ BMI ] &gt; 35 ) use oestrogens include combine contraceptive pill 6 . Clinically significant abnormality haematology clinical chemistry parameter assess investigator 7 . Ongoing medical condition accord investigator would interfere conduct assessment study . Examples medical disability ( e.g. , severe degenerative arthritis , compromise nutritional state , peripheral neuropathy ) would interfere assessment safety efficacy investigational product device performance , would compromise ability patient undergo study procedure ( e.g. , MRI ) , give inform consent 8 . For woman : pregnant , breast feeding and/or fecund woman unwillingness use adequate contraception trial : Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception NOT contain oestrogen Placement intrauterine device Barrier method contraception : Condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository</criteria>
