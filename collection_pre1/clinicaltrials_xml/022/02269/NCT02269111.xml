	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study quantitative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 3 Tesla assess disease patient tumor spread brain ( brain metastasis ) . In addition routine care brain imaging brain , study include advanced multiparametric MRI sequence measure vascular , cellular , molecular property tumor . Performing extra scan MRI provide information metastasis may better predict treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate pre-treatment measure biophysical parameter metastases—obtained use advanced , quantitative MRI technique patient receive standard-of-care ( SOC ) therapy 1-4 brain metastases—with treatment-induced change lesion size , time-to-progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo hybrid 3 Tesla MRI examination include standard MRI sequence , diffusion-weighted ( DW ) -MRI , chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST ) , combine dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) -MRI/dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) -MRI baseline .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent document Patients must diagnose one following : Primary brain tumor ( glioma , GBM etc ) ; Up 10 brain metastasis Patients must diagnose 14 brain metastasis At least one brain metastasis must measure 5 mm ( ) short axis diameter axial plane Patients must schedule undergo standard brain cancer intervention : Chemotherapy target antiangiogenic therapy , case primary brain tumor ; Stereotaxic radiotherapy ( SRS ) whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , case brain metastasis . Patients must schedule receive 3Tesla ( 3T ) MRI exam part standard care ( exam modify also include pulse sequence research ) Patients received previous treatment ( chemotherapy radiotherapy ) brain tumor ( primary metastatic ) . Patients schedule receive 1.5T MRI exam Patients incapable give informed write consent , due mental disability , alter mental status , confusion , cognitive impairment , psychiatric disorder . Patients score 14.5 low University California , San Diego Brief Assessment Capacity Consent ( UBACC ) questionnaire allow study</criteria>
