	<detailed_description>The goal proposal study effect dietary protein supplementation ( PRO-S ) surgical weight loss , nitrogen balance , energy expenditure , body composition weight loss , satiety . The overall goal provide evidence-based data optimal level protein supplementation surgical weight loss gastric bypass ( GBP ) , restrictive malabsorptive procedure , vertical sleeve gastrectomy ( VSG ) , purely restrictive procedure . We propose prospective randomize control trial ( RCT ) , , patient undergo either GBP VSG allocate standard PRO-S recommendation ( `` standard care '' accord American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery Guidelines ) high supplementation . We compare 4 group subject : - Group 1 : GBP Standard PRO-S ( 0.8g protein/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) /day - Group 2 : GBP High PRO-S ( 1.2g protein/ kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) / day ) - Group 3 : VSG Standard PRO-S ( 0.8g protein/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) /day - Group 4 : VSG High PRO-S ( 1.2g protein/ kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) / day ) AIM # 1 : Measure total body nitrogen balance ( NB ) ass adequacy level protein intake protein absorption . AIM # 2 : Measure effect PRO-S lean body mass ( LBM ) , rest energy expenditure ( REE ) . AIM # 3 : Measure effect PRO-S satiety . Hypothesis 3.1 : Patients High PRO-S group experience high level perceive satiety compare patient standard PRO-S group . AIM # 4 : Study adherence protein supplementation . Hypothesis : Adherence great Standard PRO-S group . Background Significance The obesity epidemic grown rapidly United States , associate increased morbidity mortality rate . Although preventive measure need solve obesity epidemic long-term , bariatric surgery become popular effective treatment severe obesity . Obesity co-morbidities , include type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , high health care cost2 . The cost even great severe obesity ( BMIâ‰¥40 kg/m2 ) . Protein ( PRO ) malnutrition bariatric surgery ( BS ) Bariatric surgery ( BS ) emerge effective treatment severe obesity . Gastric bypass surgery ( GBP ) result large weight loss normalization metabolic function , include T2DM remission ~60-80 % case . Weight loss significant ( ~40-50kg ) . The rate weight loss rapid first year surgery . Surgical weight loss associate vitamin , mineral , protein deficiency . PRO malnutrition , remain severe nutritional complication associate malabsorptive surgical procedure . The prevalence protein malnutrition malabsorptive BS procedure vary 3 18 % associate length bypass segment . The US recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) protein ~50 g/d healthy normal weight adult . Experts clinician recommend ~70 g/d protein low-calorie diet 60 g/day ( standard ) 120 g/day ( high ) earlier month BS . However , little evidence-based data support recommendation . In spite absence level 1 data type amount protein recommendation , American Society Metabolic Surgery BS 's website 14 link commercial nutrition supplements14 . In study , aim study protein absorption adequacy protein intake nitrogen balance patient follow standard high PRO-S follow BS . Effects dietary protein Dietary PRO-S amino acid ( AA ) important modulators body weight affect various determinant body weight regulation : satiety , thermogenesis , energy efficiency body composition . During energy restriction , sustain protein intake level requirement ( 0.8g protein/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) / day ) appear sufficient induce body weight loss preserve fat free mass ( FFM ) . Protein intake requirement ( 1.2g protein/Kg IBW/ day ) result great decrease fat mass preservation FFM , effect body weight loss . Nitrogen balance ( NB ) study The NB method classically use determine adequate protein intake measure whole body protein balance response nutritional intervention . Prolonged negative nitrogen balance sustain long period due negative impact overall health . Risk decrease lean body mass ( LBM ) rest energy expenditure ( REE ) surgical weight loss BS result large weight loss ( 30-50kg ) , fat mass ( FML ) LBM loss . Our previous observational study aim evaluate relationship protein intake loss LBM follow BS show protein intake &gt; 60g/ day associate well maintenance LBM BS . LBM main determinant REE , explain 75 % REE variance REE large component 24-h energy expenditure ( EE ) . Reduced EE may trigger weight regain population . High PRO-S diet may also benefit population increase EE prevent LBM loss . Increased EE dietary protein attribute enhanced thermic effect ( 23-30 % ) compare carbohydrate ( 5-10 % ) lipid ( 2-3 % ) . Dietary protein intake satiety High-protein intake increase satiety despite energy restriction . Proposed mechanisms follow : ketogenic state , relatively elevated plasma amino acid ( AA ) level , anorexigenic hormone concentration feedback central nervous system prolong duration one feel hunger next meal ( satiety ) , Peptide YY , Glucagon-Like Peptide -1 cholecystokinin produce response peripheral central detection amino acid , decrease level orexigenic hormone ghrelin . Protein supplementation adherence Low protein intake BS report . PRO-S always recommend BS feasibility well address RCT . We study adherence PRO-S. Increasing adherence dietary recommendation challenging , may represent key strategy improve clinical nutritional treatment outcome BS .</detailed_description>
