	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well everolimus hormone therapy work treat patient hormone receptor positive breast cancer continue spread ( progress ) return period improvement ( recur ) everolimus exemestane hormone therapy . Everolimus chemotherapy drug may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen progesterone hormone cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen progesterone body make . Giving everolimus different type hormone therapy may effective treatment breast cancer patient progress everolimus exemestane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Everolimus Beyond Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Progression free survival patient advance metastatic breast cancer receive everolimus plus hormonal therapy beyond first progression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . Clinical benefit rate ( sum stable disease , partial response , complete response ) . 2 . Response rate ( partial response complete response ) . 3 . Overall survival . 4 . Safety , side effect tolerability profile everolimus . OUTLINE : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily hormone therapy regimen choose discretion investigator ( anastrozole PO daily ; letrozole PO daily ; tamoxifen citrate PO daily ; fulvestrant intramuscularly [ IM ] PO day 1 , 15 , 29 , monthly ; megestrol acetate PO 4 time daily [ QID ] ; regimen ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
