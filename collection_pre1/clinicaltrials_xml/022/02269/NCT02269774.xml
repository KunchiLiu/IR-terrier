	<brief_summary>There accumulate evidence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) independent risk factor paroxysmal atrial fibrillation high recurrence rate atrial fibrillation ablation therapy . We previously show simulated OSA trigger premature atrial beat ( PABs ) acute change intra-thoracic pressure . Most episodes atrial fibrillation initiate PABs . However , origin PABs induce intra-thoracic pressure swing unknown . This study investigate origin premature atrial beat induce intra-thoracic pressure change simulate obstructive sleep apnea patient atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
