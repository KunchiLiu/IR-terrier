	<brief_summary>The EOS® imaging system , new image modality offer low dose , weight bear full body X-ray imaging , require new stand position patient put hand forearm wall vertically stability . Although method provide enough support patient extend X-ray acquisition time , impact postural balance sagittal profile spine sacro-pelvic parameter evaluate . The goal study identify impact patient ' arm positioning sagittal profile postural balance patient subsequently propose standardized method full spine X-ray acquisition EOS® imaging system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) Patient Positioning EOS System®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spino-pelvic sagittal analysis postural assessment important parameter adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) treatment surgical planning.The three-dimensional ( 3D ) shape spine impact patient ' posture particularly adolescent flexible spinal curve . The latter highlight importance patient ' position X-ray acquisition order avoid mislead measurement may adversely impact monitor surgical curve correction AIS . Participating subject undergo two bi-planar X-rays different position . The position instruct mean graphical presentation verbal explanation radiology technician . The first standing position EOS® imaging system full spinal X-ray acquisition consist put hand forearm front subject wall vertically . In second position , knuckle loosely place ipsi-lateral clavicle . Bi-planar X-rays take EOS® image system position . Moreover compare postural balance patient two described position , pressure mat place EOS® system . The pressure mat calibrate EOS® system permit identify position center pressure ( COP ) respect anatomical landmark . The magnitude pressure patient ' foot measure X-ray compare .</detailed_description>
