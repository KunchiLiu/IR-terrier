	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate non-inferiority efficacy switch once-daily single-tablet regimen contain darunavir ( DRV ) / cobicistat ( COBI ) / emtricitabine ( FTC ) / tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF ) ( D/C/F/TAF tablet ) relative continue current regimen consist boost protease inhibitor ( bPI ) combine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) virologically-suppressed ( human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ribonucleic acid [ HIV-1 RNA ] concentration less [ &lt; ] 50 copy per milliliter [ copies/mL ] ) HIV-1 infected participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide ( D/C/F/TAF ) Regimen Versus Boosted Protease Inhibitor ( bPI ) Along With Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) Regimen Virologically-Suppressed , HIV-1 Infected Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , active-controlled ( study experimental treatment procedure compare standard treatment procedure ) , open-label ( participant researcher aware treatment , participant receive ) , multicenter ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , study virologically-suppressed , HIV-1 infect adult participant . The study include Screening Period approximately 30 day ( maximum 6 week ) , control Treatment Period 48 week , Extension Phase 48 week . All eligible participant randomly assign receive either current treatment regimen - bPI ( limited DRV low-dose ritonavir [ rtv ] COBI , atazanavir [ ATV ] rtv COBI , lopinavir [ LPV ] rtv ) combine FTC/TDF , experimental treatment regimen - D/C/F/TAF once-daily single-tablet 48 week . After completion week 48 , participant assign experimental treatment continue D/C/F/TAF extension phase week 96 . Participants continue current regimen receive experimental treatment ( criterion fulfil ) week 52 week 96 . As Week 96 , participant give option continue D/C/F/TAF treatment , wish continue benefit D/C/F/TAF become commercially available reimburse , access another source country he/she living , sponsor terminates clinical development . A bone investigation substudy perform select study site , assess bone biomarkers energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan , approximately 300 participant ( 200 D/C/F/TAF treatment arm versus 100 control arm ) provide inform consent substudy .</detailed_description>
