	<criteria>Patients must MSKCC pathologically confirm diagnosis one follow tumor type : Ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer , Ovarian carcinosarcoma , Endometrial cancer , Endometrial carcinosarcoma All patient ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer ovarian carcinosarcoma must recurrent disease , one prior line chemotherapy must platinumbased chemotherapy management primary disease . This initial platinumbased treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation/maintenance and/or biologic/targeted agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab , PARP inhibitor ) part firstline treatment . Patients endometrial cancer endometrial carcinosarcoma may either chemotherapy naive OR one prior line chemotherapy must platinumbased chemotherapy regimen adjuvant advanced/recurrent setting . The initial platinumbased treatment may include consolidation/maintenance and/or biologic/targeted agent part firstline treatment . Patients enter trial chemotherapy naive MUST Stage IVB recurrent disease AND disease amenable curative intent . Patients must measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must great equal 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; great equal 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must great equal 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Be least 18 year age . Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Have adequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic neurologic function define follow : Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Renal function : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min ( CockcroftGault calculation ) Hepatic function : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 3 x ULN ( less equal 5 x upper limit normal patient liver involvement cancer ) ( ULN = institutional/laboratory upper limit normal ; LLN = institutional/laboratory lower limit normal ) Neurologic function : Neuropathy ( sensory motor ) less equal Grade 1 . Patients must recover effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy biologic/targeted therapy baseline CTCAE le equal Grade 1 ( exclude alopecia nonclinically significant AE 's ) . Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior study treatment initiation . Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include chemotherapy , biologic/targeted therapy immunologic therapy , must discontinue least 3 week prior study treatment initiation . Any investigation agent must discontinue least 30 day prior study treatment initiation . Any prior radiation therapy must discontinue least 4 week prior study treatment initiation . At least 4 week must lapse since major surgery ( e.g. , laparotomy , laparoscopy , thoracotomy , video assist thoracoscopy ) prior study treatment initiation . Patients must willing able swallow oral tablet . Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . Patients childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior study entry practice effective form contraception . Sexually active subject must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control course study 4 month last dose study drug . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Patients pregnant nursing . Patient previous treatment selinexor . Patients history evidence upon physical examination CNS disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control , brain metastasis and/or epidural disease , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) within six month prior first date study treatment . Patients require drainage gastrostomy ( e.g. , drainage PEG tube ) and/or parenteral hydration and/or nutrition . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease . This include : Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic great equal 160 mm Hg diastolic great equal 100mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication . Myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior first date study treatment . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure . History serious ventricular arrhythmia ( i.e. , ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation ) serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . This include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation control ventricular rate . Corrected QT interval calculate Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 500 m . Note : initial QTcF find &gt; 500 m , two additional ECG 's separate least 3 minute perform . If average three consecutive result QTcF less equal 500 m , subject meet eligibility regard . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition organ system dysfunction , investigator 's opinion , could compromise subject 's safety , put study outcome undue risk Uncontrolled active infection require parenteral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within one week prior first date study treatment . Patients macular degeneration , uncontrolled glaucoma , markedly decrease visual acuity</criteria>
