	<detailed_description>Tinnitus common problem severe impact quality life . At present truly successful treatment available . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) method stimulate brain application magnetic field series rapid pulse . Applying area brain think responsible tinnitus may offer valuable treatment patient . The overall aim research see patient tinnitus benefit treatment rTMS , particular whether one type ( continuous theta burst ) effective variation rTMS . Prior develop definitive study address area feasibility study need perform . The propose feasibility study aim determine outcomes necessary enable development definitive study future . Particularly ensure adequate recruitment possible confirm acceptability study design participant . We assess success choose placebo intervention blind method . The variance change tinnitus level follow treatment enable sample size calculation perform use future study . 40 patient suffer idiopathic tinnitus randomise 2 group , control group receive sham treatment , active treatment group receive theta-burst rTMS 5 consecutive day . The effect treatment assess use Tinnitus Functional Index exist validate tinnitus questionnaire . Feasibility outcomes assess monitor retention recruitment rate use questionnaire related feasibility outcome</detailed_description>
