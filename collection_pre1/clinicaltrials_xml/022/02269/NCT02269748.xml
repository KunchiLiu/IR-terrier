	<detailed_description>The aim randomized-controlled clinical trial compare patient morbidity root coverage outcomes sub-epithelial connective tissue ( SeCTG ) use combination coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) tunnel technique ( TT ) . The study design single-centre , randomize , clinical trial treatment single gingival recession . The study assess two different treatment modality : tunnel technique subepithelial connective tissue graft ( TT ) , compare coronally advanced flap subepithelial connective tissue graft ( CAF+SeCTG ) term clinical outcome , post operative morbidity . 50 patient one gingival recession treat . Evaluation patient morbidity perform 3 day 1 week surgery . Clinical outcome evaluate 12 month post operatively . Clinical outcome include percentage root coverage ( RC ) complete root coverage ( CRC ) record . Patient morbidity evaluate questionnaire . Clinical measurement ( 1 week surgery 12 month follow-up ) - Gingival recession height ( GH ) - Probing depth ( PD ) - Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) - Height keratinize tissue ( KTH ) Patient morbidity - Quantity analgesic take first week post-surgery . - Patients ' post operative discomfort , bleeding , stress inability chew evaluate questionnaire give patient 3 day follow surgery . Kolmogorov-Smirnov test use analyze distribution continuous variable . Continuous variable express mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) compare baseline U Mann-Whitney test . This test also use compare mean change post vs. baseline measurement . The Wilcoxon test use compare post vs. baseline measurement . Spearman correlation use evaluate association . Level significance set 0.05 . The SPSS v. 20 software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) use analysis .</detailed_description>
