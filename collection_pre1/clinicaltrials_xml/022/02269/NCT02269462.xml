	<brief_summary>Mother-to-child transmission HIV ( MTCT ) pregnancy breastfeed prevent maternal antiretroviral drug ( ARV ) infant nevirapine post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) . However , pharmacokinetics certain ARVs associate marked inter-individual variability . This variability associate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene encode metabolise enzyme , transporter transcriptional regulator . Pregnancy also associate additional change pharmacokinetics . The result sub-therapeutic supra-therapeutic drug exposure may serious consequence virological control , MTCT , emergence drug resistance , toxicity . Foetal infant exposure maternal ARV pregnancy breastfeed believe play role prevention mother-to-child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) . However , exposure may also result toxicity . For example , efavirenz contraindicate child less 3 year old 10kg transfer breastfed baby breast milk . On hand , double exposure nevirapine breast milk PEP may also predispose breastfed infant nevirapine-associated toxicity . In proposed study , influence select SNPs certain drug disposition gene pharmacokinetics efavirenz nevirapine pregnancy lactation , well level infant exposure drug breast milk , study . Mathematical model develop predict potential dose optimisation strategy pregnancy , predict infant exposure maternal drug breast milk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Genetic Factors Pharmacokinetics Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy Lactation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This observational study conduct two phase . In preliminary phase , association select SNPs drug disposition gene mid-dose plasma breast milk efavirenz nevirapine concentration explore unselected cohort HIV positive pregnant woman nurse mother breastfed infant take either drug part combination antiretroviral therapy PMTCT . In second phase , SNP independently associate high predictive power use stratify pregnant woman mother-infant pair three group : non-carriers , heterozygote , homozygote . Randomly select pregnant woman mother-infant pair group re-recruited invited intensive pharmacokinetic phase . Samples collection : In preliminary phase , mid-dose pair dried blood spot ( DBS ) ( dry breast milk spot nurse mother ) sample collect single , recorded time point post dose . In intensive pharmacokinetic phase , DBS ( dry breast milk spot nurse mother ) sample collect multiple time point observe dose efavirenz nevirapine . Samples ship room temperature Department Molecular Clinical Pharmacology , University Liverpool , United Kingdom analysis . DNA extraction SNP genotyping : Genomic DNA extract use available commercial kit accordance manufacture 's protocol genotyping perform allelic discrimination real-time polymerase chain reaction use TaqManÂ® chemistry-based assay . Drug quantification pharmacokinetic analysis : Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method develop quantification efavirenz nevirapine DBS dry breast milk spot . Pharmacokinetic parameter determine use standard procedure .</detailed_description>
