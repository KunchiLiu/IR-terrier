	<brief_title>Development Circulating Molecular Predictors Chemotherapy Novel Hormonal Therapy Benefit Men With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) ( PCF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study construct multi-center clinical database men treatment abiraterone acetate , enzalutamide , taxane chemotherapy , comprehensively analyze CTC DNA copy gains/losses whole exome sequencing acquire mutation , CTC RNA AR-variants evidence epithelial plasticity , plasma circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) whole exome sequencing . Significantly , investigator pair presence key propose circulate biomarkers treatment resistance patient outcomes systemic therapy purpose develop predictive biomarkers may direct clinical utility guide choice therapy . It propose specific AR-v 's ( i.e . AR-v7 ) , biomarkers epithelial plasticity , microtubule interact protein variant convey docetaxel resistance enrich men fail abiraterone acetate enzalutamide , AR genomic event ( AR amplification , AR-v567es , AR mutation , GR overexpression ) responsive taxane chemotherapy . This work represent first-in-field comprehensive analysis CTC molecular profile development CTC molecular taxonomy mCRPC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . Pure small cell neuroendocrine tumor prostate permit . 2 . Clinical radiographic evidence metastatic disease . 3 . Planned therapy either enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate within come 6 week 4 . Castrate level testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/dl ) recent assessment and/or document ongoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy lease three month . 5 . Evidence disease progression follow recent therapy evidence least one following : Radiographic evidence disease progression define one new bone scan lesion consistent flare/healing , growth soft tissue/visceral metastasis great one centimeter ( cm ) long diameter ( 2 cm shortest diameter lymph node ) . Clinical progression define treat physician ( pain progression ) Consecutive PSA rise meet PSA progression criterion determine PCWG2 criterion ( increase &gt; 25 % &gt; 2 ng/mL nadir , confirm second value 3 week later ) 6 . At least two follow high risk feature screen rapid disease progression : 1 . Anemia hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dl 2 . Elevated alkaline phosphatase institution upper limit normal 3 . High lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) upper limit normal 4 . Prior therapy enzalutamide , abiraterone acetate , orteronel . Patients permit continue therapy restart therapy expose past . 5 . Presence visceral metastasis image 6 . Presence clinically significant pain require opioid analgesia 7 . Patients Cellsearch CTC &gt; 5 cell per 7.5 mL whole blood ( available standard care ) eligible without additional high risk feature 8 . PSA double time 3 month recent therapy 9 . Radiographic progression entry base new lesion ( ) bone , soft tissue , visceral metastasis 7 . Age &gt; 18 year . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . History intercurrent past medical psychiatric illness would make participation blood draw protocol difficult feasible discretion principal investigator coinvestigator ( ) . 2 . Treatment anthracycline mitoxantrone within 1 week CTC collection 3 . Prior docetaxel castration resistant metastatic setting . Patients treat docetaxel metastatic castration sensitive disease eligible . 4 . Unwillingness follow longitudinally serial CTC biomarker study .</criteria>
