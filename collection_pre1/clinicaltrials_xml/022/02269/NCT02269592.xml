	<brief_summary>Blood cancer occur molecule control normal cell growth damage . Many change detect directly examine part cancer cell blood . Several alteration occur repeatedly certain type blood cancer already identify , discovery lead development new drug target alteration . More remain discover . Some abnormality include alteration gene . Genes part cell contain instruction tell investigator body grow work , determine physical characteristic hair eye color . Genes compose DNA letter spell instruction . Studies DNA molecule make gene call `` molecular '' analysis . Molecular analysis way read DNA letter identify error gene may contribute increase risk cancer behavior cancer cell . Some change gene occur cancer cell . Others occur gene pass parent child . This research study examine kind gene . The best way find gene study large number people . The investigator expect many 1000 individual enroll study . This research study try help doctor scientist understand cancer occur develop way well treat prevent . To participate study participant must cancer , past , risk develop cancer . The participant undergo test procedure require part routine clinical care . The investigator ask participant provide additional sample tissue obtain clinical care include blood , bone marrow , tissue sample . The investigator also ask gentle scrape inside cheek , mouthwash skin sample obtain germline DNA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study perform molecular analysis tissue ( obtained biopsy ) , blood , body fluid saliva . Importantly , study use tissue specimen already collect part participant 's clinical care . The participant 's tissue sample may use create living tissue sample ( call `` cell line '' ) grown laboratory . This allow researcher unlimited supply cell future without ask sample . In study , analyse perform material necessary clinical test perform . In general , additional procedure require . However , investigator ask participant 's permission obtain one additional sample blood ( teaspoon ) , gentle swab inside mouth sample skin obtain cell . These source normal , non-cancer cell need type analysis . To fully understand effect molecular alteration blood cancer , must analyze context clinical behavior . Therefore , study also ask participant 's permission link molecular alteration cancer leukemia clinical information generate course clinical care . No additional clinical test require . The investigator ask see participant follow regular interval follow risk progression . Some participant 's specimen well material generate analysis tissue blood may useful future study . The Investigator 's ask participant 's permission store specimens material secure storage facility possible later use . Finally , rapid progress understand treat cancer occur molecular information derive tissue blood share researcher . In particular , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) organization develop special data ( information ) repositories analyze data collect result certain type genetic study . These central bank store genetic information sample give researcher study . Therefore , Investigators also ask permission share result special bank . The participant 's information send code number attach . The participant 's name directly identifiable information give central bank . There many safeguard place protect participant 's information sample store repository use research . The investigator think risk participant 's privacy confidentiality share information bank . However , investigator 's predict genetic information use future .</detailed_description>
