	<brief_summary>The prevalence chronic pain estimate 30 % US value may report true prevalence people experience long term pain additional research show 73 % reoccurrence symptom within 12 month original injury indicate pain symptom may resolve , additional impairment issue may underlie symptom . Biopsychosocial factor depression , post traumatic stress , anxiety , pain catastrophizing , negative emotion closely link pain influence patient 's pain perception . Along line , memory past experience trauma potentially play large role biopsychosocial response . Research evolve strong correlation establish chronic pain prior history trauma abuse also non-traumatic incident motor vehicle accident injuries/surgical procedure . This led speculation research explore variety life event may become stimulant long-term alteration process manifestation pain may endure impact physical health outcome . The propose research add body knowledge underlying association pain , memory , autonomic system , neuromuscular function . The goal project study relationship pain memory system , specifically acute pain , short-term memory pain , long term pain memory , effect upon neuromuscular autonomic system responses body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This study utilize repeated measure quasi-experimental case control design structure . Subjects place two grouping , history prior low extremity injury history low extremity injury . The two grouping age gender match . Subjects prior history lower extremity injury match subject prior history injury . There equivalent number participant per group similar demographic information group order reduce number variable influence result experiment . Within grouping , specific intervention cluster performed set . These cluster intervention randomize minimize internal test error . Both group participant expose intervention ( baseline , pain pressure , visualization pain pressure prior injury , mental challenge test ) . Investigators responsible test outcome measurement blind grouping subject ( past history prior history injury ) . It anticipate test , include initial set , take 60 75 minute . All test take place Mount St. Mary 's College physical therapy exercise research lab private room Knight Physical Therapy Inc. Study Methods Initial Set Up ( 25 minute ) Upon commencement study , subject ask fill Tampa Kinesiophobia Questionnaire , Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire , Fear Pain Scale , Pain Catastrophizing Scale , Vividness Visual Imagery Questionnaire . This take approximately 10 minute . Following completion questionnaire , introduce investigator ask lie supine upon treatment table . A pillow place head comfort . Surface EMG rRecording electrode place upon belly tibialis anterior muscle . An electrode place upon medial tibia serve ground two electrode . Placement electrodes correspond side injury ( i.e . prior injury right ankle would result electrode placement right tibialis anterior right anterior deltoid muscle ) . In subject without history injury , side electrode placement predetermine randomize . Also time , subject prior history injury ask identify location injury . The tester palpate area previous injury locate tender point area . This point mark pen later use . In subject prior injury , anterior talofibular ligament , lateral knee joint line , lateral belly gastrocnemius muscle locate marked side test . The site randomize blind tester . Testers inform side test seal envelope open prior test . They blind prior injury grouping . At point , subject walk procedure initial pain pressure threshold measurement take simulated break test ( see description break test ) perform foot / ankle order familiarize subject test procedure also ensure equipment function optimally . This process take approximately 10 minute . Following procedure , timer set subject rest position five minute acclimate environment normalize autonomic system . Autonomic System Response ( 10 minute ) Following five-minute acclimation period , heart rate variability ( HRV ) data record , mark , use baseline measurement . The HRV data collect throughout test procedure . Initially , site previous injury ( randomized pressure site subject prior history injury ) , tester use thumb apply pressure site . The pressure increase subject report maximal pain level . Prior application pressure , subject inform experience maximum pain tolerable inform tester level reach . The subject next instruct notify tester reach maximum tolerable pain . Once achieve , pressure maintain 10 second order get baseline HRV recording . After 10 second , pressure release HRV record mark . At time , subject ask report level pain scale 1 10 . The subject rest three minute return HRV baseline value . At point , subject instruct close eye imagine pain pressure leg apply . HRV pain value mark record . The subject rest another three minute ask close eye . In instance , ask visualize detail prior injury . In subject prior injury , ask visualize muscle , bone , blood flow tibia . Like , HRV pain value mark record . Following another three minute rest period , subject ask complete mental challenge test . This test require subject count backwards quickly possible 100 7 . HRV pain value mark record . With test , test , subject allow withdrawal test reason without repercussion . Pressure Pain Threshold ( 10 minute ) The amount pain force require elicit pain response apply monitored Wagner Force Tenâ„¢ FDX Digital Force Gauge Pain Algometer . The algometer device design measure sensitiveness pressure pain study ; algometer use measure sensitiveness pain product pressure . The Wagner Force Ten Digital Algometer portable unit small 1 cm2-rubberized tip capable applying pressure 50 lbs./ft . The unit capable remember multiple data point store peak force force-averaged data retrieve test later analysis . During five test component ( Baseline , Pain Pressure , Visualization Pain Pressure , Visualization Prior Injury , Mental Challenge Test ) test procedure identical apply earlier , except instead measure muscle performance HRV , pain pressure record . The tip pain algometer place upon site prior injury upon anterior talofibular ligament . Pressure apply algometer subject instruct inform tester first begin experience pain . This value record along HRV value . Neuromuscular Response ( 15 minute ) During next phase testing , small roll towel place test ankle . The towel utilized raise foot table order facilitate testing . At point , tester stabilize low extremity grasp calf approximately 12 inch malleolus . This hand provide counter force force apply test hand . In test hand , Hoggan Scientific Microfet 2TM Handheld Muscle Tester place upon lateral aspect fifth metatarsal bone foot . The placement proximal metatarsal approximately base fifth metatarsal bone . The position sensor mark standardize test position measure later force measurement purpose . The subject instruct isometrically resist force apply tester . At point , Surface EMG Force record commence simultaneously . The Surface EMG utilized measure action potential propagation . Surface record electrode place upon skin measure action potential . At time needle utilized collect data therefore , penetration skin require . The initiation test also note HRV record . A steady increase amount force apply slowly gradually foot medially slightly caudal direction subject longer resist force . This process call `` break test '' muscle test longer resist force . The subject rest 30 second break test associate data recording repeat two time 30-second rest period test . The subject allow rest three minute prior begin next portion study . HRV test start tester previously describe place pain pressure upon site previous injury . The location site previous mark consistency application . In subject prior history injury , pressure apply anterior talofibular ligament . When pain pressure reach 's maximal level , second tester perform break test subject . Following test , subject rest 30 second process repeat two time 30 second rest period test . Force , EMG , HRV , pain value record break test . Following three minute rest period , subject ask visualize pain pressure place upon leg ( visualize tibia previously describe ) three break test perform visualization process . Force , EMG , HRV , pain value record break test . This process repeat visualization prior injury mental challenge test .</detailed_description>
