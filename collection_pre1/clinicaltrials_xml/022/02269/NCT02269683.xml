	<brief_title>Robotic vs. Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical resection potentially curative therapeutic approach patient pancreatic cancer . Among clinicopathologic factor associate long-term survival , complete ( i.e . R0 ) tumor resection utmost significance . Numerous report already demonstrate detection tumor cell resection margin microscopic examination ( i.e . R1 resection ) associate poor long-term survival . However , study use standardized pathological work-up operative specimen patient pancreatic cancer reveal pancreatic resection R1 resection . Innovative surgical technique reduce incidence R1 resection may provide promise approach improve outcome patient pancreatic cancer . For patient require distal pancreatectomy , laparoscopic pancreatic resection increasingly perform , may enhance postoperative recovery without compromise oncological safety compare open approach . However , laparoscopic technique affect proportion patient complete ( R0 ) resection . Furthermore , inability control major vasculature frequently result conversion open approach . The vast majority R1 margin locate retroperitoneal dissection surface . Due technical limitation , open laparoscopic technique may reduce incidence positive resection margin location . The 3D visualization provide robotic approach together improve dexterity surgeon likely enable meticulous dissection posterior dissection margin . This may result significant reduction patient positive resection margin . However , date randomize control trial compare robotic laparoscopic technique . As health-care intervention need prove efficacy safety well-designed randomize controlled trial , present randomize controlled trial design test , robotic distal pancreatectomy increase incidence patient complete ( R0 ) tumor resection pancreatic cancer . Secondary endpoint include oncological parameter number harvest lymph node factor perioperative outcome perioperative complication ( Clavien-Dindo classification ) , pancreatic fistula , in-hospital mortality , blood loss conversion rate .</detailed_description>
