	<brief_summary>Unilateral hearing loss ( UHL ) child demonstrate negative impact quality life , school performance behavior . Despite knowledge , remain unclear best manage common problem . There much debate regard issue many program recommend preferential seating classroom use frequency-modulated ( FM ) system amplify teacher 's voice classroom ( conventional measure ) , others recommend accommodation addition use hear aid amplification ( amplification ) . There limited research support refute efficacy hear aid improve measurable academic , behavioral , quality-of-life ( QOL ) outcomes child UHL . We propose study evaluate impact hearing aid use school-aged child ( age 6-12 year ) mild moderately severe UHL . In study , subject randomize receive either conventional measure conventional measure plus amplification . After three month period , group reverse , subject serve control . Outcome measurement include patient report disease-specific QOL report patient , parent , teacher use validated survey instrument regular interval throughout study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Amplification Children With Unilateral Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral hearing loss ( UHL ) define decreased hear one ear , normal hearing threshold contralateral ear . Approximately 0.83/1000 newborn child find UHL . It estimate 3-5 % child United States eventually diagnose UHL . When cutoff normal hearing place 15 decibel ( dB ) , incidence high 6.3 % , correspond prevalence 6.2 million child nationally . The management UHL continue area debate , handicap associate UHL often underestimate . In fact , UHL often go without assistance due lack recognition disability health educational professional , claim hearing loss `` attract little attention either patient parent '' `` child experience communicational educational problem . '' However , evaluation child permanent hearing loss , rate child need speech/language intervention aural rehabilitation significantly different bilateral permanent hearing loss unilateral permanent hearing loss . Unfortunately , child UHL half likely refer hear test bilateral hearing loss . Studies demonstrate negative impact unilateral hearing impairment child . Educational behavioral difficulty clearly show , number study demonstrate increase rate failure least one grade child UHL compare classmate normal hearing ( 24-35 % vs. 3.5 % ) . Additionally , increase special educational need ( 12-41 % ) frequent problem behavior also note population . In several study , Lieu colleague show poor performance child UHL . In study look oral write language score , child UHL significantly bad sibling , serve matched control , language comprehension , oral expression , oral composite score . In addition , child four time likely Individualized Education Plans ( IEPs ) twice likely receive speech-language therapy . Despite finding regard impact UHL child , paucity literature support refute efficacy hear aid use improve measurable academic , behavioral , quality-of-life ( QOL ) outcome . While hear related disease-specific quality life measure child develop recently , previous study adults UHL report decreased quality life , increased frustration shame due hearing disability . The Hearing Environments Reflection Quality Life questionnaire , HEAR-QL , instrument develop validate Washington University St. Louis young child hear loss initially ( 2011 ) later adolescent ( 2013 ) , examined effect environment , activity , feeling child unilateral bilateral hearing loss . Significantly low score , indicate poor quality life , see patient UHL bilateral hearing loss . Interestingly , differences quality life child UHL child bilateral hearing loss find significant 1 3 subdomains . A 2010 study Johnstone et al . demonstrated child UHL use amplification young age ( 6-9 year ) improvement localization acuity , receive amplification old age ( 10-14 year ) note impairment localization . This may indicate time initiation amplification UHL may play important role whether intervention beneficial . In addition , Noh Park 's study 2012 demonstrate child UHL need sit 3.5 meter closer teacher obtain speech discrimination score child binaural hearing . While accomplished small room setting , may possible time class , certainly translatable hear environment outside classroom . It clear whether add amplification would eliminate handicap improve quality life , behavior , academic performance . Current intervention : Multiple option exist management UHL . Preferential seat classroom often first line treatment utilized , place child front classroom well hear ear toward teacher . Evaluation classroom educational audiologist specialist education child hear loss order optimize listen environment another commonly utilized modality manage UHL . Interventions carpeting , tennis ball place legs chair , selection classroom lower ambient noise level outside traffic air handle equipment reduce significantly improve signal noise ratio student . Another modality improve signal noise ration use frequency-modulated ( FM ) system classroom , specifically amplify teacher 's voice via microphone worn teacher . This increase signal-to-noise ratio teacher 's voice amplify background noise . Differentiating relevant sound signal background noise particularly challenge problem child UHL . Other option management UHL include various form amplification include unilateral hearing aid , contralateral rout sound ( CROS ) system , potentially cochlear implantation ( though practice widely adopt child UHL United States ) . In study date compare modality one another , Updike compare speech perception measure 6 child , age 5 12 year , mild profound UHL use FM system , CROS aid , conventional hearing aid . He conclude FM system beneficial hearing situation degree hear loss . In addition , state neither hear aid CROS aid provide benefit speech understanding , may worsen speech perception noisy situation . Multiple limitation exist study , include small sample size lack time period patient adjust use amplification . In study look acceptance hearing aid use child UHL , child mild moderately severe hear loss tend accept hearing aid , severe profound hearing loss less accept . Parental satisfaction hearing aid population good , many notice improved hearing child . More recently , Briggs et al . publish study look 8 child , age 7 12 year , mild moderately severe UHL , aid digital hearing aid . Although speech perception score show significant improvement , parent subjectively report significant improvement quality life 3 month use . In one German study 3 child severe profound unilateral hearing loss , improvement speech understand noise sound localization follow cochlear implantation observe subjective improvement report parent . Compliance use amplification also consider case , Fitzpatrick et al . demonstrate study 670 child unilateral bilateral hearing loss . While amplification recommend 90 % , less two-thirds child wore hear aid consistently . To date , two study exist examine use amplification child unilateral hearing loss . Both study limit small sample size . In addition , early study evaluate analog hear aid , whereas present day , digital hearing aid widely use , limited short study period . Our study propose examine whether child UHL note improve quality life use amplification via hear aid conjunction conventional classroom accommodation include FM system . In study compare use conventional measure conventional measure plus digital hearing aid affect ear use validated quality life instrument administer subject , subject 's teacher , subject 's parent . The instrument use HEAR-QL , CHILD , LIFE-R ( See outcome measure detail ) . Each survey administer five time total : time enrollment , midpoint first treatment arm , completion first treatment arm , midpoint second treatment arm , completion second treatment arm . Comparisons make among group describe later proposal . Our practice well suit carry study tertiary care center serve large region . Our multidisciplinary pediatric hearing loss clinic allow child evaluate longitudinally follow conjunction audiology , speech language pathology , neuropsychology , medical genetics . In past year , 300 visit cod unilateral hearing loss base ICD-9 code , 70 unique patient , make recruitment target sample size 3-year study period feasible . The potential impact study great , consensus whether amplification recommend child unilateral hearing loss , study power would serve useful guide decision-making process .</detailed_description>
