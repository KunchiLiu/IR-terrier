	<brief_title>Postcath Radial Arterial Clamp Time In CAth Lab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine safety short radial artery clamp time post cardiac catheterization respect achieve hemostasis incidence radial artery occlusion . The investigator hypothesize short radial artery clamp time follow cardiac catheterization achieve similar hemostasis longer clamp time decrease incidence radial artery occlusion .</detailed_description>
