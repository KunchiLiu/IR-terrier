	<detailed_description>COPD CHF frequently coexist , cause significant worsening quality life patient increase morbidity mortality . The prevalence COPD CHF patient range 20 % 32 % case , CHF prevalent 20 % patient COPD . COPD CHF patient complicate frail high risk re-hospitalizations ; reason individualized multidisciplinary program need implement patient . The chronic disease trend fluctuating , burden many exacerbation vicious circle dyspnoea , decreased activity , new exacerbation , depression social isolation , lead death . The weight evidence meta-analysis randomize trial indicate multidisciplinary disease-management approach best outcomes term prolong survival reduce hospital-readmission rate . Home-based management might , arguably , preferred approach hospitalization chronic diseases patient . Home-base management might provide opportunity prevent clinical deterioration hospitalization comprehensive , long-term intervention regular reinforcement patient adherence , knowledge , skill . A personalized hospital-discharge programme seem best approach plan follow-up care patient chronic disease . These programme , particularly important care patient multiple comorbidities , include routine self-management support , consist education recognize symptom early , manage medical device , identify barrier adherence therapy adverse effect drug , check intensity physical therapy appropriate . Our study want investigate feasibility efficacy multidisciplinary telehealth tele-rehabilitation home base program patient COPD CHF . This integrate , multidisciplinary nurse therapist orient program ; two figure central role home base intervention become essential interface dialogue patient specialist . The nurse therapist , competence , collect information , carry education training , verify adherence drug physical therapy , verify quality caregiver assistance . When need , require intervention specialist consultation second-opinion . After drug therapy optimization physical rehabilitation program definition , patient allocate randomly 2 group : 1 . Group A ( usual care ) : patient follow usual care manner General Practitioner ( GP ) routine specialist visit . 2 . Group B ( Home-based intervention ) : patient monitor home 4 month nurse therapist perform individual rehabilitative program include least 3 sessions/week mini-ergometer exercise 2 sessions/week walking pedometer . At baseline , 4 month 2 month follow-up patient group undergo follow clinical physical evaluation : 1 . ECG ( T0 ; T4 need ) 2 . Echocardiogram ( T0 , T4 need 3 . Spirometry ( T0 spirometry available previous year ) 4 . Arterial blood gas ( T0 ; T4 ) 5 . Walking test ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 6 . Metabolic Holter monitoring use Body Monitoring Multi-Sensor Armband ( BMSA ) ( SenseWear ) wear triceps right arm least 72 h. ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) The questionnaire scale : 1 . Minnesota ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 2 . COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 3 . Barthel ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 4 . Dyspnoea muscle fatigue Borg scale evaluation , refer patient regular day ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 5 . Medical Research Council ( MRC ) scale dyspnoea regular day ( T0 ; T4 ; T6 ) 6 .
