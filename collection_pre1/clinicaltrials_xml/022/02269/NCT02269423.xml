	<detailed_description>This study conduct assess whether vaccine safe , cause body create infection-fighting response . Between 1994 present , many Ebola virus outbreak cause 4 different strain virus , affect mostly people live central Africa health care provider try treat . Ebola viruses member filoviridae virus family , also include dangerous Marburg virus . Ebola virus cause severe often deadly infection call viral hemorrhagic fever , characterize organ failure , bleeding , death . To date , virus find primarily Central West Africa . It clear viruses come , think bat likely source human outbreaks occur . Once outbreak occurs , virus spread person person direct contact infect blood body fluid infect individual . Given recent increase Ebola virus infection occur Africa , interest making effective vaccine protect infection.. BPSC-1001 experimental Ebola vaccine candidate demonstrate protection Ebola virus animal experiment . This phase 1 protocol provide first-in-human study evaluate safety toxicity BPSC-1001 healthy adult participant . Participants randomize receive BPSC-1001 Placebo intramuscular injection . Three dose level assess follow-up visit 180 day injection .</detailed_description>
