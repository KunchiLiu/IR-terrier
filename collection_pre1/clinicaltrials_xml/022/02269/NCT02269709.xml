	<brief_title>Stage 3 Fontan Operation Liver Ultrasound Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Fontan repair single ventricle congenital heart lesion consist three stage , long-term survival expect . Stage 3 introduces immediate congestion blood within liver increase central venous pressure ( CVP ) many patient later develop progressive liver fibrosis . There establish , noninvasive mean detect liver fibrosis become severe . Ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI ) elastography noninvasively measure stiffness liver , increase congestion fibrosis . The investigator hypothesize liver stiffness increase stage 3 operation due onset liver congestion . Using ARFI elastography , investigator measure liver stiffness immediately stage 3 Fontan operation , congestion blood likely contributor change liver stiffness . The investigator also characterize relationship liver stiffness CVP . The investigator trend liver stiffness one-year time point repeat ARFI imaging .</detailed_description>
