	<detailed_description>Influenza acute respiratory disease cause influenza virus . There three type virus include A , B C. Both type A type B viruses cause acute febrile respiratory tract infection , characterize sudden fever , headache , muscle pain , cough , sore throat , nasal congestion general malaise . The main transmission influenza highly contagious aerosol droplet contain influenza virus pass infected people susceptible population . Each year fall winter infection influenza widespread various age group , high incidence rate . Although influenza generally self-limiting disease , child , elderly ( especially 65 year old chronic heart , lung , kidney , liver , blood metabolic diseases diabetes certain disease ) poor immunity function , influenza easily lead serious flu complication pneumonia , result severe increase morbidity mortality . Influenza periodically cause worldwide pandemic . For nearly century , influenza virus occur four large variation , cause three world pandemic . Studies show since 1957 , new variant influenza virus start China , recognize world high incidence influenza . At present , trivalent influenza vaccine widely use China . They contain two kind type A virus antigens one type B virus antigen . But since 2000 , two kind type B strain ( Victoria Yamagata ) cause alternating cycle different season . Gradually , evolve original single lineage influenza B virus B/Yamagata , two distinct antigenic lineages-B/Victoria B/Yamagata alternately dominate caused mix popular lineage . These two lineage little nearly cross-protection . Therefore , trivalent influenza vaccine may cover popular strain influenza B virus , whereas quadrivalent influenza vaccine help simultaneously prevent two kind type A virus two kind type B virus . In order evaluate safety tolerance quadrivalent influenza vaccine produce Jiangsu Jindike Biotechnology Co. , Ltd. phase I clinical trial plan conduct healthy adult age 18 49 year China .</detailed_description>
