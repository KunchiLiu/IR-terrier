	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass efficacy `` patient navigator '' program us train community lay health worker assist Hispanic patient utilize cancer care service . This study two part study . The first part study consist retrospective data collection procedure call `` baseline clinical chart audit '' 50 Hispanic woman 18 year age mammography abnormality classify BI-RADS 3 , 4 5 . These data drawn study clinic 's exist record serve baseline data subject recruit course study . The second part study , intervention group , involve recruitment 50 low-income , Hispanic woman receive abnormal breast cancer screen result ( also classify BI-RADS 3 , 4 5 ) screening service local community health clinic . Participants significantly high compliance rate significantly short time lag abnormal screen result , confirmatory screening test commencement treatment , compare baseline . The investigator expect least 12 % increase after-screening compliance rate 25 % reduction time lags treatment group , relation pre-intervention baseline assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer lead cause cancer-related death Latinas , chiefly later diagnosis . The time screen diagnosis critical optimizing cancer care , yet efficacy navigation reduce insufficiently document . Here investigator evaluate culturally sensitive patient navigation program reduce time diagnosis increase proportion woman diagnose within 30 day 60 day . METHODS . The investigator analyze 425 Latinas Breast Imaging Reporting Data System ( BI-RADS ) radiologic abnormality categorize BI-RADS-3 , BI-RADS-4 , BI-RADS-5 July 2008 January 2011 . There 217 woman navigate group 208 woman control group . Women navigate locally trained navigator navigate ( data group abstract chart ) . The Kaplan-Meier method , Cox proportional hazard regression , logistic regression use determine difference group . RESULTS . The time diagnosis shorter navigate group ( mean , 32.5 day vs 44.6 day control group ; hazard ratio , 1.32 ; P ¼ .007 ) . Stratified analysis reveal navigation significantly shorten time diagnosis among woman BI-RADS-3 radiologic abnormality ( mean , 21.3 day vs 63.0 day ; hazard ratio , 2.42 ; P &lt; .001 ) among BI-RADS-4 BI-RADS-5 radiologic abnormality ( mean , 37.6 day vs 36.9 day ; hazard ratio , 0.98 ; P ¼ .989 ) . Timely diagnosis occur frequently among navigate Latinas ( within 30 day : 67.3 % vs 57.7 % ; P ¼ .045 ; within 60 day : 86.2 % vs 78.4 % ; P ¼ .023 ) . This driven BI-RADS-3 stratum ( within 30 day : 83.6 % vs 50 % ; P &lt; .001 ; within 60 day : 94.5 % vs 67.2 % ; P &lt; .001 ) . A lack missed appointment associate timely diagnosis . CONCLUSIONS . Patient-centered navigation assist Latina woman abnormal screen mammogram appear reduced time diagnosis increase rate timely diagnosis overall . However , stratified analysis , navigate Latinas initial BI-RADS-3 screen benefit , probably reduction miss diagnostic appointment group .</detailed_description>
