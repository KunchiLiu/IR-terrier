	<brief_title>Salvage Therapy With High/Low Methotrexate Loss Response Infliximab Dose Escalation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : IFX mono-therapy become method choice treatment pediatric CD , though strategy call question due frequent loss response IFX require dose escalation IFX decrease interval IFX ( 40 % first year ) ( 1 ) . This loss response attribute development ATIs low trough level IFX , develop first infusion . This loss response often occur patient prior azathioprine exposure ( 2,3,4 ) . Currently , first step loss response infliximab child dose escalation either decrease interval infusion double dose . However , patient persistent antibody high titer likely fail even dose escalation . The Sonic trial clearly demonstrate combination therapy thiopurine may effective Anti TNF alpha monotherapy ( 2 ) . Ben Horin et al demonstrate antidrug antibody reverse improved anti TNF trough level obtain add immunomodulator fail monotherapy due antidrug antibody ( 3 ) . We previously show patient previous loss response two biologics lead cessation biologics respond reinduction adalimumab methotrexate . Among 12 patient ( 10 child two adult ) , 6 obtain complete remission . We subsequently lower several patient without loss response , try stop methotrexate 3 patient . All 3 patient relapse within month complete cessation methorexate.In previous study take two separate action restore response , re-induction methotrexate therapy . In current proposal take patient escalated therapy add methotrexate , order evaluate add methotrexate weekly restore response loss response infliximab fail dose escalation.It important note methotrexate increase risk malignancy co-therapy far know . Methods : It prospective open label phase 4 , non randomize uncontrolled study small cohort patient evaluate addition methotrexate restore remission loss response infliximab dose escalation paediatric patient .</detailed_description>
