	<brief_title>Trial PCI-32765 ( BTK Inhibitor ) Combination With Carfilzomib Relapse/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible study , begin first cycle ibrutinib carfilzomib . Each cycle 28 day . Ibrutinib Dosing : You take 2-4 ibrutinib capsule ( depend enter study ) every day 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . The number capsule depend enter study . You must take capsule time every day , least 30 minute eat least 2 hour meal . Do open capsule dissolve . If miss dose , take 6 hour time would take . If later 6 hour , skip dose start take capsule time usual next day . If vomit dose see capsule take , retake dose . If vomit see capsule , retake dose . Start take capsule time usual next day . You need fill diary card information take ibrutinib . You bring diary card every visit . Carfilzomib Dosing : On Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-12 , receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . The first 2 dos receive may lower late dos . This low risk allergic reaction . On Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 Cycles 13 beyond , receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . You drink least 6-8 cup ( 8 ounce ) water fluid per day , start 2 day first dose long doctor asks . During Cycle 1 , receive fluid vein dose carfilzomib . If doctor think need , also receive fluid vein dose carfilzomib Cycle 2 . Before receive carfilzomib , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . During Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 , check side effect 1 hour receive carfilzomib . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical neurological exam . - You EKG check heart function . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test see well blood clot . - If doctor think need , PET scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Days 2 , 9 , 16 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test see well blood clot . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , every cycle Cycle 12 every 3 cycle , CT scan check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 1 , 4 , every 3 cycle : - You EKG . - You ECHO MUGA scan . On Days 8 15 Cycles 1 - 3 : - You physical exam ( Cycle 1 Day 15 Cycles 2 3 ) . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test ( Cycles 1 2 , Day 15 Cycle 3 ) . On Day 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test see well blood clot . On Day 28 Cycle 1 : - You EKG . - You ECHO MUGA scan . If study doctor think disease completely respond study treatment , follow test procedure perform confirm status disease : - You colonoscopy , include biopsy abnormal growth . To collect biopsy , small amount tissue remove cut tool . - You bone marrow biopsy . - If doctor think need , PET scan . The test may repeat time doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete long-term follow-up phone call . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 30 day finish take study drug : - You physical neurological exam . - You EKG check heart function . - Blood ( 3-5 tablespoon ) draw routine test see well blood clot . - You PET scan chest x-ray check status disease . - If doctor think need , CT scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . - If doctor think need , colonoscopy GI endoscopy look abnormal area . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Long Term Follow-Up : After end-of-dosing visit , study staff call every 6 month 5 year ask find treatment receive . These call take 2-3 minute . In addition phone call , medical record may review time well . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treat MCL chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treat certain type multiple myeloma . Giving carfilzomib patient MCL investigational . The combination ibrutinib carfilzomib investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 35 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
