Therefore , investigator hypothesize increase NO generation body administration L-arginine , precursor NO , improve metabolic phenotype increase BAT volume , thereby increase REE clearance triglyceride glucose BAT . To investigate , investigator perform randomize placebo-controlled multicenter cross-over study moderately obese Dutch South Asians match white Caucasians . Subjects receive L-arginine ( 9 gram/day ) placebo 6 week , follow wash-out period 4 week 6 week one either treatment . At end treatment period , cold-induced PET-CT scan perform .

	<brief_title>L-arginine Brown Adipose Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The South Asian population originally descend Indian subcontinent represent approximately 20 % total world population . This population face epidemic type 2 diabetes , underlie cause still unknown . A high prevalence disadvantageous metabolic phenotype , consist obesity , insulin resistance dyslipidemia , may least part contribute excess risk . It currently hypothesize ethnic susceptibility towards disturb energy metabolism may underlie disadvantageous metabolic phenotype . In line , investigator recently discover Dutch South Asian subject 32 % low rest energy expenditure ( REE ) 34 % low energy-combusting brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) compare match white Caucasians . Nitric oxide ( NO ) recently show crucial BAT development , interestingly , South Asians diminish NO bioavailability . Thus , disadvantageous metabolic phenotype South Asians may cause diminished NO bioavailability result low BAT volume . Therefore , investigator hypothesize increase NO generation body administration L-arginine , precursor NO , improve metabolic phenotype increase BAT volume , thereby increase REE clearance triglyceride glucose BAT . Objectives : The primary objective : 1 ) determine effect L-arginine glucose uptake brown adipose tissue ass whether effect differs South Asian white Caucasian subject ; 2 ) determine effect L-arginine whole body energy expenditure ass whether effect differs South Asian white Caucasian subject ; 3 ) determine effect L-arginine fat mass ass whether effect differs South Asian white Caucasian subject . Study design : A randomized placebo-controlled multicenter cross-over study perform moderately obese Dutch South Asians match white Caucasians . Subjects receive L-arginine ( 9 gram/day ) placebo 6 week , follow wash-out period 4 week 6 week one either treatment . At end treatment period , cold-induced PET-CT scan perform . Furthermore , muscle fat biopsy obtain , thermoregulation assess , oral glucose tolerance perform investigator ass NO-dependent independent vasodilation mean iontophoresis . Study population : Mildly obese ( BMI 25-30 kg/m2 ) pre-diabetic male volunteer South Asian white Caucasian descent age 35-50 year . Intervention : The intervention consist administration 9 gram L-arginine per day three gift ( 3dd 3 gram ) .</detailed_description>
