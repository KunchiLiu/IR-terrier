	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate toxicity effectiveness electrochemotherapy bleomycin treatment primary liver tumor clinical study phase I II . The study include 10 patient phase I clinical study additional 15 patient phase II clinical study ( extension clinical study ) , fulfill inclusion criterion . Treatment effectiveness evaluate DCE-US CT perfusion , detect early event tumor perfusion ECT compare tumor perfusion ECT . Long term effectiveness treatment evaluate modified RECIST criterion , take account difference size density , determine image obtain CT perfusion treat tumor nodule ECT . Tumor volume calculate follow formula , short b longer tumor diameter . The secondary objective trial quantify impact treatment patient 's quality life , tolerance therapy suitability large study conduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Primary Liver Tumors With Electrochemotherapy ( ECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct patient primary liver tumor . 10 patient include phase I clinical study additional 15 patient phase II clinical study ( extension clinical study ) . Depending position tumor , appropriate electrode select ; hexagonal needle electrode fix geometry tumor large 3 cm diameter , low edge tumor locate 3 cm liver capsule longer single needle electrode . Individual electrodes , position accord prepared treatment plan use tumor 7 cm diameter , locate near vena cava large hepatic portal vein . Electrochemotherapy perform within 8-28 min intravenous bolus administration bleomycin ( 15 mg/m2 ) . Triggering electric pulse synchronize ECG signal , ECG trigger device AccuSync avoid delivery pulse vulnerable period heart . All patient treat procedure thoroughly describe , sign informed consent .</detailed_description>
