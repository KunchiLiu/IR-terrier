	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance key reaction surgery trauma reflect degree metabolic stress . With great degree insulin resistance development complication increase , particular infectious complication . The aim study determine robotic assist total laparoscopic hysterectomy induce less insulin resistance compare abdominal hysterectomy . Insulin resistance measure hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp method . In addition inflammatory factor clinical recovery measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized control single center study . Primary screen take place gynecological ward Orebro University hospital accord inclusion exclusion criterion . 20 patient enrol . All participant randomize robotic assist total laparoscopic hysterectomy total abdominal hysterectomy . The main purpose study determine robotic assist laparoscopic hysterectomy induces less insulin resistance compare abdominal hysterectomy . Both patient benign malignant disease include . In addition inflammatory factor IL-6 CRP measure clinical recovery measure . Each patient study twice use hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp , method gold standard determine insulin sensitivity . During clamp insulin infuse intravenously attain elevation level see abnormal meal . At time glucose infused balance effect insulin maintain normal blood glucose level . The amount glucose infusion need level insulin sensitivity . The clamp procedure perform surgery control measure morning surgery yield relative change insulin sensitivity cause operation ( postoperative insulin resistance ) . Before onset infusion , 60 minute steady state insulin stimulation , blood collect analysis immune function . This also collect 3 hour surgery . A 6 minute walk test perform surgery day surgery , order determine clinical measure recovery . In addition demographic clinical data systematically collect hospital stay 30 day .</detailed_description>
