	<brief_title>The Effect Therapeutic Fecal Transplant Gut Microbiome Children With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The enteric microbiota accept important etiologic factor pathogenesis human Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) immune-mediated chronic experimental intestinal inflammation , ample data implicate microbiome main factor occurrence IBD . This inferred animal germ-free environment protect experimental colitis . In addition , increase gut permeability due dysbiosis , frequently see patient IBD even remission , similarly , first degree relative IBD . Therefore , surprising therapeutic intervention aim modify gut microbiome would therapeutic benefit . Ulcerative colitis condition characterize chronic inflammation colon . It important pediatric disease 25 % case begin childhood incidence continuously rise . It believe related genetically environmentally-generated alter immune response enteric microbiome . Previous work PI 's laboratory suggest child harbor unique gut microbial profile , predict therapeutic response . Therefore , modify gut microbiome may result therapeutic benefit . However , attempt modify gut microbiome largely unsuccessful advent fecal transplant , new approach treat colitis . Fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) introduce several decade ago attempt restore gut microbial balance appear efficient method effectively change sustain gut microbial composition . To date number successful report suggest control disease activity case cure disease . This study aim determine safety efficacy FMT treat child ulcerative colitis</detailed_description>
