	<brief_summary>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) rare , inherit metabolic disease cause inactivating mutation Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALPL ) gene , cod Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( TNAP ) . Penetrance disease severity heterogenous , range stillbirth adult-onset manifestation . Especially latter characterize extremely broad spectrum symptom . This scope variability make difficult attribute individual patient ' symptom disease distinguish HPP independent health issue . Especially adult HPP patient , musculoskeletal problem , include ( fragility- ) fracture / bone bruise , joint pain , reduce mobility , muscular weakness pain reduce muscular endurance appear reflect prevail burden disease , especially respect patient dis-abilities daily life . To expand current knowledge natural history disease well disease specific musculoskeletal deficit HPP , adult patient establish Diagnosis HPP know Orthopedic Institute , University Würzburg , offer participate single , multimodal assessment disease history , current symptom disability , lab evaluation clinical technical analysis musculoskeletal status capability . Patients invited day long visit clinic order perform follow assessment : A ) Epidemiologic / anamnestic information B ) Physical examination C ) Structured questionnaire D ) Laboratory examination E ) Clinical functional test F ) Technical Examinations</brief_summary>
