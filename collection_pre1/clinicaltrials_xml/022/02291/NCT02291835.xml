While link diet periodontal health exists , relationship diet heal follow periodontal therapy yet investigated.The objective study determine high intake food nutrient antioxidant anti-inflammatory activity associate reduce probe depth follow sanative therapy . Sanative therapy first line cost-effective treatment manage periodontal disease thus prevent tooth loss . Patients chronic generalized periodontitis undergo sanative therapy recruit study . Mean probe depth assess baseline 8-16 week follow sanative therapy . Dietary intakes fruit , vegetable , vitamin dietary fat estimate use Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire supplement use record use questionnaire .

	<detailed_description>Oral health , specifically retention teeth , inextricably positively link nutritional status individual . The emerge inter-relationships among obesity , type II diabetes metabolic syndrome , acute coronary syndrome and/or breast cancer etiology periodontal disease identify nutrition unique role potentially modulate complex relationship . Some nutrient vitamin D fatty acid study extensively nutrient . Cross-sectional study use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data cohort identify individual higher intake vitamin D omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid decrease risk periodontal disease tooth loss . One study identify individual well vitamin D status ( measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ) good recovery sanative therapy . Sanative therapy routine , first line cost-effective treatment manage periodontal disease thus prevent tooth loss . It non-surgical process involve mechanical debridement bacterial biofilms root teeth , level gum line . Although one study report association vitamin D outcomes sanative therapy , status nutrient overall dietary pattern assess relation recovery sanative therapy . The objective study determine high intake food nutrient antioxidant anti-inflammatory activity , include fruit , vegetable , Î²-carotene , vitamin C , vitamin D , vitamin E omega-3 fatty acid associate reduced probe depth follow sanative therapy . The study take place periodontal clinic Southern Ontario , Canada . Prior enrolment , patient attend consultation baseline periodontal examination , include measurement probe depth six site per tooth complete . Patients chronic generalized periodontitis prescribe sanative therapy part treatment plan invite participate study . The study explain presented letter invitation . Written consent obtain patient wish participate . Patients return clinical approximately two month later sanative therapy appointment . Prior meeting hygienist perform sanative therapy , participant meet study nurse . The nurse collect venous blood sample , use measurement serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration . The nurse also measure participant 's height , weight , waist circumference hip circumference . After sanative therapy perform , participant provide Block Food Frequency Questionnaire supplement use questionnaire complete home . Participants return clinic 8 -16 week later routine follow-up examination , include measurement periodontal probe depth . Additionally , information include participant age , sex , health condition , medication , allergy smoke habit record medical form complete consultation visit .</detailed_description>
