	<detailed_description>Oral poliovirus vaccine live attenuate viral vaccine vaccine virus OPV mutate acquire neurovirulence cause paralysis either due vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) due circulate vaccine-derived poliovirus ( cVDPVs ) , attenuate vaccine virus acquire ability cause paralysis also circulate similar wild poliovirus ( WPV ) . The potential vaccine virus acquire neurovirulence cause paralytic poliomyelitis incompatible eradication polio . Therefore , polio eradication require eventual cessation OPVs . The last case WPV2 report 1999 India . Type 2 vaccine virus tOPV likely cause cVDPVs 80 % cVDPVs past decade cVDPV2 . Of estimate 250-500 annual VAPP case almost 40 % due type 2 . Thus , eradication WPV2 imperative prioritize removal type 2 contain OPV . The licensing availability bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) contain type 1 3 offer option OPV contain OPV2 . In April 2013 , Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization ( SAGE ) recommend phased cessation OPV type start switch trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( tOPV ) bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) . In November 2013 , SAGE recommend country introduce least one dose IPV routine immunization program administer first dose IPV â‰¥14 week age . In country routine immunization schedule 6 , 10 14 week age 2 , 3 4 month age , IPV would add DTP3 visit child schedule administer first immunization visit 14 week later child schedule . For country 2 , 4 6 month schedule , IPV could add either DTP2 DTP3 visit . SAGE also propose country flexibility consider alternative schedule include administer IPV earlier 14 week age administer one dose IPV . The principal objective pre-eradication introduction IPV mitigate risk associate increased susceptibility type 2 poliovirus bOPV introduce . Therefore , objective achieve high possible type 2 population immunity IPV , product per dose immunogenicity IPV coverage achieve IPV vaccination visit routine immunization . At present , study assess immunological response type 2 poliovirus single dose IPV 14 week age , SAGE recommend target age IPV introduction . Furthermore , need determine immunological response potential alternative IPV introduction routine immunization within context EPI schedule include immunological response one dose IPV . Also urgent need document immunogenicity bOPV 6 , 10 14 week age IPV type 1 3 poliovirus . In trial , investigator try determine immunogenicity alternative schedule administer IPV SAGE recommend schedule IPV 14 week age . How immunogenicity multiple dos IPV 6 14 week age compare one dose 14 week age ? How IPV immunogenicity 6 week age compare IPV 14 week age ? It well establish seroconversion multiple dose IPV increase large interval IPV dos . A study Cuba report high type 2 seroconversion ( 89 % vs 83 % ) two dos IPV administer 2 month apart ( 8 16 week age ) compare three dos IPV administer one month apart ( 6 , 10 14 week age ) . The propose trial compare 2 dos IPV ( 6 14 week age ) single dose IPV administer either 6 14 week age . This trial would assess type 2 seroconversions IPV also determine prim type 2 poliovirus different propose IPV schedule . Additionally , trial participant receive bOPV 6 , 10 14 week age . This would permit trial determine type 1 type 3 seroconversions observe combination bOPV IPV . Setting : Study area The study conduct suburb Dhaka area Mirpur .
