	<detailed_description>Patients &gt; 18 year age admit Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit Cardiology Hospital , National Medical Center , Century XXI ( Mexico City ) diagnose ST segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) hyperfibrinogenemia within 72 h symptom onset include . Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) diagnose high myocardial necrosis marker find CPK total &gt; 150 % basal value troponin I ≥1 ng/ml plus one following : ischemic precordial pain &gt; 30 min with/without dyspnea , diaphoresis , nausea , vomit , ST segment elevation &gt; 1 mm two contiguous lead leave bundle branch block , new presume new . Hyperfibrinogenemia diagnose fibrinogen concentration reach &gt; 500 mg/dl 72 h evolution . All patient sign informed consent form participate study . Patients know bezafibrate allergy , previous fibrate treatment , patient cardiogenic shock , hepatic failure , renal failure , history neoplastic disease , chronic inflammatory disease active infectious process , anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive therapy , fibrinolysis streptokinase patient triglyceride concentration &gt; 150 mg/dl exclude . Patients classify two group : group I , patient receive 400-mg bezafibrate dose every 24 h plus conventional anti-ischemic therapy ; group II , patient receive conventional anti-ischemic therapy . Patients assign group use random number table . Conventional adjunctive anti-ischemic therapy include dual antiplatelet therapy , antithrombotic , beta blocker , statin , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , others accord case . Twelve-lead ECG carry daily recurrent ischemic event . Laboratory test also carry include cardiac enzyme , lipid profile CRP . Our goal determine bezafibrate therapy combine conventional anti-ischemic therapy reduces fibrinogen level . Primary endpoint recurrent ischemic event reinfarction post-infarction angina leave ventricular failure . Secondary endpoint death , need revascularization combine clinical endpoint present randomization patient discharge . Blood sample take patient venipuncture upper extremity ( Vena basilica , cephalic tax ) : 4.5 ml blood , collect 0.5 ml tube vacutainer sodium citrate buffer ( 9 : 1 ) 0129 M 3.8 % ( blue top ) , use determine coagulation time fibrinogen ; another 7 ml , collect vacutainer tube dry ( red cap ) . The sample centrifuge 2000 rpm 10 min serum obtain divide aliquot 200 ul keep -70 ° C subsequent biochemical determination . This procedure perform admission Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit day 5 , 7 30 randomizationAll patient hospital discharge , cite telephone 30 day randomization , take blood sample , well clinical evaluation.Fibrinogen Determination All venous blood sample ( 4.5 ml ) take upper limb ( basilic vein , cephalic vein tributary ) collect Vacutainer ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) tube 0.5 ml sodium nitrate buffer ( 9:1 ) 0.129 M 3.8 % ( blue top ) . This procedure repeat discharge 7 day patient subject long hospital stay . PT-Fibrinogen HS Plus kit ( Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA ) use . This contain high-sensitivity calcium thromboplastin determine prothrombin time fibrinogen evaluate extrinsic pathway coagulation citrate human plasma use auto-analyzer ACL-800 ( Cobas , Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) fibrinogen level determine turbidimetry . Test measure correlation r = 0.95 . Units report fibrinogen mg/dl standard control 273 mg/dl linearity 700 mg/dl . c ) Clinical evaluation For clinical follow-up evaluation randomization , presence recurrent cardiovascular event regard secondary endpoint : event recurrent ischemia either presence angina , reinfarction , silent ischemia , need procedure Emergency myocardial revascularization leave ventricular failure , shock death , state time randomization presentation event , electrocardiographic biochemical change occur time . Both hospital stay , discharge , data obtain either directly history , physical examination laboratory , clinical record , take account assessment treat physician record data collection sheet . Cytokines assay Concentration cytokine ( IL-8 , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF e IL-12 ) measure ELISA system ( Biosource ) , two different monoclonal antibody different epitope interleukin , biotinylated detector antibody , conjugate Streptavidin-HRP ( SAV ) buffer , chromogen substrate stop solution . Once plasma sample supernatant unfroze , standard sample dilute standard dilutor assay buffer . A100μl standard , sample , supernatant control added coat microtiter plate duplicate test incubate hour . The biotinylated detector antibody dilute buffer add 50μl 100 μl well , except empty chromogen , incubate 1 hour 37°C . Plates wash ; 100 μl SAV dilute buffer , add well incubated 45 min . Microtiter plate wash . Tetramethylbenzidine substrate add ( 100 μl well ) , incubate 15min darkness room temperature . Finally 50 100 μl stop solution use . Plates read 30 min , 490 nm automate microplate reader . Statistical Analysis Continuous variable describe accord distribution ( mean ± standard deviation , median percentile ) . Demographic characteristic population express frequency percentage . Student t-distribution use bivariate analysis continuous variable group comparison parameter normal distribution Mann-Whitney U test non-normal distribution . Wilcoxon test use analyze fibrinogen concentration difference within group . Dichotomous variable test use X2 Fisher 's exact test depend expect value .
