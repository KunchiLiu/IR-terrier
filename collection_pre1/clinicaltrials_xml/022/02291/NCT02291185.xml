	<brief_summary>The beach chair position ( BCP ) commonly use shoulder arthroscopic surgery . Hemodynamic instability frequently encounter problem associate BCP . In addition , high rate cerebral desaturation event report surgery BCP . Although fluid loading could alleviate hypotension associate BCP , may lead volume overload . As alternative static index , dynamic preload index pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) report sensitive predictor fluid responsivness several surgical condition . The investigator examine ability PPV SVV predict fluid responsivness shoulder arthroscopic surgery BCP . Using transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) , investigator directly estimate change cardiac output BCP .</brief_summary>
