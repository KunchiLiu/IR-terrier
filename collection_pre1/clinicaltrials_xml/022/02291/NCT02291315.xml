	<brief_summary>Adequate calcium absorption essential reduce one 's risk develop osteoporosis . However , postmenopausal Thai woman consume diet habitually low calcium due lactose intolerance dietary pattern typically include milk-based product . The primary goal study measure fractional calcium absorption milk commonly ingest green leafy vegetable ( cassia ) postmenopausal Thai woman habitually low calcium intake . The secondary objective determine association calcium absorption biomarkers impact vitamin D status bone metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Absorption Postmenopausal Thai Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmenopausal Thai woman ( n=22 ) recruit community surround Bangkok Nakhon Pathon , Thailand . They invite participate isotope study compare fractional calcium absorption milk cassia . Upon arrival , fast blood sample draw morning absorption study analyze serum marker vitamin D bone metabolism ( 25-hydroxy vitamin D [ 25OHD ] , parathyroid hormone [ PTH ] , beta-crossLaps ) determine impact calcium absorption . Following blood draw , woman receive stable calcium isotope ( 42Ca ) intravenously . Then breakfast lunch respectively , woman randomly assign orally ingest stable calcium isotope either milk ( 44Ca ) cassia ( 43Ca ) test meal . On day two , woman receive breakfast , snack , lunch meal . Urine sample collect entire 28 hour period 24-hr urine collection use measure urinary calcium concentration calculate fractional calcium absorption .</detailed_description>
