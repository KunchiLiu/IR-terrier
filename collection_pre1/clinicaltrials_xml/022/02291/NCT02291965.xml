	<detailed_description>The long-range goal work improve overall survival hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCT ) recipients personalize condition regimen and/or intravenous ( IV ) busulfan ( BU ) dose use metabolomics . BU essential part majority HCT conditioning regimen , narrow therapeutic index ; low BU plasma exposure ( cause rapid clearance ) associate increase risk rejection relapse , high BU plasma exposure associate increase risk hepatotoxicity . Although pharmacokinetic ( PK ) -based dose target BU exposure often conduct , relapse toxicity continue problematic . Furthermore , short IV BU course necessitate alternative method personalize IV BU . IV BU clearance , however , associate polymorphism glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) A1 GSTM1 , predominant GSTs BU conjugation glutathione . Therefore , investigator seek test work hypothesis metabolomic signature , provide novel insight vivo cellular response metabolite identification , associate IV BU clearance . Investigators first determine endogenous metabolomics-based biomarkers obtain BU administration predict IV BU clearance . Researchers evaluate endogenous biomarkers use target ( glutathione pathway ) global analyse via liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy . In addition , investigator seek evaluate IV BU metabolism use metabolomics parallel gas chromatography-mass selective detection patient receive PK-based IV BU . Researchers evaluate plasma concentration eight different metabolite , build upon experience tetrahydrothiophene ( THT+ ) . To complement metabolomic work , investigator seek validate covariates associate IV BU PK , specifically age body size , mitigate typical challenge metabolomics research : lack understand potentially confound factor . FHCRC reference clinical laboratory PK-based BU dosing since 1996 thus , FHCRC researcher large database IV BU PK . Using population pharmacokinetic ( popPK ) analysis , investigator validate covariates IV BU PK guide future metabolomic study . This popPK analysis immediately improve patient care use covariates accurately estimate IV BU start dose ( i.e. , PK-based dosing ) create limited sampling schedule efficiently use PK-based dosing . These complementary aim , seek identify novel metabolomics-based biomarkers , could overcome critical barrier HCT condition balance response toxicity . Based compelling preliminary data , researcher expect identify endogenous metabolomic signature influence choice IV BU start dose intention improve overall survival patient receive IV BU-containing HCT regimens .</detailed_description>
