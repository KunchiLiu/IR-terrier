	<brief_title>School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study ( SICAS-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our proposal build upon establish , successful school-based infrastructure determine whether school/classroom intervention efficiently effectively improve asthma morbidity reduce exposure . Our goal determine efficacy school/classroom base environmental intervention reduce asthma morbidity urban schoolchildren . Our central hypothesis reduce classroom/school exposure mouse allergen , mold , particulate pollutant decrease asthma morbidity student asthma . The investigator plan test hypothesis intervention study 300 elementary student asthma multiple classroom inner-city elementary school . Our clinical trial aim determine effectiveness school/classroom base environmental intervention ( school integrate pest management classroom air purify filter unit within school ) reduce asthma morbidity . Our mechanistic aim test hypothesis effect school/classroom-based environmental intervention symptoms/other measure asthma control occur change gene methylation expression pathway ( secondarily , gene ) relevant airway function asthma . This expand understand asthma immunopathogenesis create opportunity identify potential novel target asthma therapy .</detailed_description>
