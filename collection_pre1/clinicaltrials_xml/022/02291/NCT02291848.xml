	<brief_summary>This study patient cancer call Multiple Myeloma . This research study use special immune system cell call tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) , new experimental therapy . The protein investigator target study call tumor associate antigen ( TAAs ) . These cell proteins specific cancer cell.They either show show low quantity normal human cell . In study target five common TAAs call NY-ESO-1 , MAGEA4 , PRAME , Survivin SSX . On different protocol , patient treat far treatment show safe . Investigators want try treatment patient multiple myeloma . These TAA-specific CTLs investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find large safe dose TAA-specific CTLs , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TUMOR-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 390 mL ( 78 teaspoon ) blood collect patient one three occasion two month period . Under certain condition related patient 's health , blood may need collect use process call apheresis . Apheresis process blood pass machine separate component blood need . The remainder blood return patient 's body . Investigators use blood grow T cell . They first grow special type cell call dendritic cell cause activity T cell . Once make investigator load small piece protein call peptide take TAAs want target . This help train T cell kill cell TAAs surface . Then investigator expand TAA-specific CTLs . The cell infuse intravenous ( IV ) infusion patient 10 minute . The patient may pre-treated acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) . Initially , two dos TAA-specific CTLs give two week apart . The patient 's disease assess pre-infusion 6 week second infusion . If second infusion decrease patient 's disease remain stable , patient receive six ( 6 ) additional dos TAA-specific CTLs monthly interval . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital . In first second infusion 6 week last infusion , patient ask receive anti-cancer treatment , radiation therapy chemotherapy , exception lenalidomide , thalidomide , pomalidomide , immune checkpoint inhibitor , CTLA4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor . If receive therapy in-between first second infusion cell , patient take treatment able receive second infusion cell . This dose escalation study . This mean beginning , patient start low dose ( 1 4 different level ) TAA-specific CTLs . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 4 dose level study . If side-effects severe , dose lower TAA-specific CTL infusion stop . Before treated , patient receive series standard medical test : - Physical exam . - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurement patient 's multiple myeloma blood test bone marrow biopsy ( within 4 week CTL infusion ) - Measurements patient 's tumor routine image study . - Pregnancy test ( use blood sample ) patient female child . Medical Tests During After Treatment : - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurement patient 's multiple myeloma blood test bone marrow biopsy ( 4-6 week 8-12 week post 1st CTL infusion ) . Imaging study 8 week 1st CTL infusion . To learn way TAA-specific CTLs work patient 's body , extra 20-40 mL ( 4-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 6 . Afterwards , blood collect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month last infusion . The investigator use blood see long TAA-specific CTLs last , look immune response cancer . Patients contact year 4 additional year ( total 5 year follow-up ) evaluate disease response long-term .</detailed_description>
