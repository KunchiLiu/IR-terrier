	<detailed_description>Circadian clock find discrete area brain , find virtually every organ body , include heart , lung immune system . Disruptions circadian clock , chronopathology , may underlie various form cardiovascular , pulmonary , metabolic disorder . Over past two decade , molecular geneticist `` crack '' clock reveal core biochemical mechanism evident organism fruit fly human . These mechanistic insight lead discovery link clock function ever-expanding array prevalent disease , include heart , lung , metabolic sleep disorder . Yet prevalence circadian disruption patient population unclear current test easily apply clinical setting yet develop . Perhaps major limitation technique need serial sampling extend period least 24 hour case longer . The development assay single blood draw would represent major step forward , facilitate assessment circadian disruption range disease . An alternative strategy exist assay use genomic microarrays analyze circadian rhythm . Many study number organisms well multiple organ tissue find substantial fraction genome ( 2-10 % ) robust circadian clock control . Importantly , hundred rhythmic gene exhibit expression peak time throughout day , presumably reflect time-of-day specific function . Using foundation , Ueda colleague propose alternative strategy would allow assessment circadian time single blood draw allow routine assessment circadian clock state . In brief , identify complement rhythmic gene liver mouse . They select set approximately 50 gene unique peak time `` time-indicating gene . '' They assess transcript level time-indicating gene single time day find could accurately determine time day liver take base relative expression level time-indicating gene . These study provide proof-of-principle approach propose . Establishing molecular assay human circadian rhythm single time point allow u identify circadian rhythm disorder , assess internal biological time deliver therapy efficacious time .</detailed_description>
