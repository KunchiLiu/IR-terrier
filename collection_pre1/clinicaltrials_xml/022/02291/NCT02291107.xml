	<brief_title>Robot-assisted Gait Training Patients With Multiple Sclerosis : Efficacy Comparison With Traditional Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , highly variable distribution demyelinization area axonal loss Central Nervous System lead complex unpredictable neurological deficit clinical pattern . Gait disorder reduce speed stride length , gait asymmetry , increase muscular energy expenditure , balance deficit increase risk fall , represent one disable aspect . These motor problem strongly influence level independence person affect MS able achieve , result severe negative impact quality life . Therefore , improvement walk ability primary goal rehabilitation treatment . Many study demonstrate conventional rehabilitation treatment base physiotherapy could effective increase muscle strength motor function , improve gait mobility ability , reduce fatigue risk fall , lead finally overall increase patient autonomy . According recent neurophysiological concept base neural plasticity , recent year rehabilitative approach seem effective improve functional performance base concept task-specific repetitive training . As case constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) upper limb rehabilitation body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) low , factor appear positively affect patient outcome intensity , precocity , repeatability , specificity training incorporate high number repetition task-oriented practice . Hence , interest automate robotic device gait train MS patient grown . With consistent , symmetrical lower-limb trajectory , robotic device provide many proprioceptive input may increase cortical activation stimulation Central Pattern Generator ( CGPs ) order improve motor function . The use robot-assisted-gait-training ( RAGT ) allow : repetition specific stereotype movement order acquire correct reproducible gait pattern condition balance symmetry , early start treatment use activity body weight support , safeguard patient reduction fear fall , order increase quantity quality perform exercise minimize intervention therapist . However , study effectiveness methodology still poorly numerous term functional improvement patient MS . The aim control cross-over study evaluate effectiveness robot-driven gait orthosis ( Lokomat - Hocoma , Inc. , Zurich , Switzerland ) gait train patient affected Multiple Sclerosis comparison ground conventional gait training . The improvement gait pattern , motor ability autonomy functional activity daily live assess use validated clinical functional scale quantitative instrumental analysis gait kinematic parameter</detailed_description>
