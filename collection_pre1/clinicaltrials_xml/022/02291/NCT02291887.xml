	<detailed_description>A cohort patient responsive treatment ranibizumab resistant aflibercept identify previously conduct retrospective study . Identified patient blood drawn genome wide sequencing . The sequence data compile analyzed attempt identify common genetic basis patient susceptible ranibizumab resistant aflibercept . Blood sample draw genetic analysis patient enrol study . The sample ( 1 tube- 6mL blood ) collect use - 8.5mL PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes ( http : //www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample- technologies/genomic-dna/paxgene-blood-dna-tubes ) . Samples store -80 time analysis . Note blood draw perform satellite clinic transport main facility storage -80 freezer . It understand ARC PI staff PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes keep sample stable room temp 1-2 day . However , staff transport sample timely fashion ( room temp , ice , dry ice , etc ) , -80 freezer storage sample collect . Once sample collect , ship Genentech analysis . DNA extraction , generation genetic data , subsequent analysis perform Genentech via third party . DNA assay polymorphisms genome wide SNP chip whole genome sequencing . The subject 's genotype haplotype correlate visual response OCT response .</detailed_description>
