	<brief_summary>This trial test whether novel therapeutic approach , cat immunotherapy combine investigational new drug call MEDI9929/AMG 157 ( anti-TSLP [ thymic stromal lymphopoietin ] antibody co-developed Amgen MedImmune ) lead last tolerance cat allergen.The objective study determine whether one year immunotherapy combine MEDI9929/AMG 157 induce tolerance cat allergen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-TSLP ( AMG 157 ) Plus Antigen-Specific Immunotherapy Induction Tolerance Individuals With Cat Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study implement concept refer `` allergen-plus , '' aim enhance disease-modifying mechanism allergen-specific immunotherapy combine anti-inflammatory immune-modulating agent . Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) cytokine appear instrumental initiate maintain allergic sensitivity antigen , Immune Tolerance Network ( ITN ) investigator hypothesize block TSLP administration cat immunotherapy induce durable immune change lead tolerance . CATNIP conduct multiple site US enroll cat‚Äêallergic adult randomize four possible treatment group : immunotherapy plus MEDI9929/AMG 157 , immunotherapy plus placebo , placebo plus MEDI9929/AMG 157 , two correspond placebo . This study specifically enrol cat allergic individual live cat order limit exposure allergen outside study . Treatment give one year , follow one year therapy .</detailed_description>
