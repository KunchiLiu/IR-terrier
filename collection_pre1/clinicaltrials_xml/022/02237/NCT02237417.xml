	<brief_summary>This Phase 4 , randomize , open-label , parallel group study design assess clinical biological effect 12 month treatment long act intramuscular ( IM ) aripiprazole ( Abilify® ) measure clinical behavioral measure , change magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan subject schizophrenia compare SOC oral antipsychotic medication compare healthy control group . It hypothesize improved treatment compliance lead few white matter change brain . Fewer white matter change demonstrate via neuroimaging increase FA BPF value prefrontal region , increase metabolite voxel center anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) see MRS . Therefore , aim study examine structural metabolic effect aripiprazole ( Abilify® ) monthly patient schizophrenia use MRI technique examine effect association cognitive clinical measure .</brief_summary>
