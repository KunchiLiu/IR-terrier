	<brief_summary>Up half military veteran traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) also suffer co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Both link high risk chronic pain , one common health complaint among U.S. veteran serve Operation Enduring Freedom ( Afghanistan ) , Operation Iraqi Freedom ( Iraq ) , Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) . However , pain medication elevate risk opioid abuse , study indicate veteran perceive barrier traditional mental health treatment . Little research exist regard non-pharmacological , technology-based intervention design reduce pain veteran PTSD TBI . Mobile technology use implement neurofeedback ( EEG biofeedback ) show promise provide portable , low-cost intervention reduce pain veteran co-occurring disorder . We aim test feasibility effectiveness use mobile neurofeedback device reduce pain symptom veteran PTSD TBI . Veterans PTSD , TBI , chronic pain receive NeuroSky headset ( read EEG brain wave ) iPod Touch app call Mobile Neurofeedback ( provide neurofeedback induce relaxation ) . Veterans teach use together neurofeedback home 12 week . Guided exist research preliminary data , hypothesize participant show high level adherence NeuroSky + Mobile Neurofeedback intervention 3-month study duration participant show statistically significant reduction pain symptom 3 month compare baseline . Given link pain outcome veteran , also explore effect drug abuse , violence , suicidality . When research complete , field change know whether new technology read EEG brainwave use treat symptom among individual suffer chronic pain . We also know whether neurofeedback show promise effective intervention veteran PTSD TBI reduce pain related outcome . If program research successful , impact shift approach manage pain clinical practice , veteran civilian</brief_summary>
