	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare Chocolate PTA Balloon standard Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( PTA ) catheter . The investigator use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Quantitative Vascular Angiography evaluate acute vascular response vessel treat Chocolate Balloon standard balloon catheter , primary endpoint luminal gain assess OCT lumen volume measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize treatment either Chocolate Balloon catheter standard balloon angioplasty catheter . All angioplasty procedure conduct treatment balloon full discretion physician accord standard practice hospital device Instructions Use . All patient undergo baseline OCT image addition standard angiography . Post-PTA , patient undergo repeat OCT image immediately post-procedure 10-minutes post-procedure assess vascular recoil .</detailed_description>
