	<brief_summary>Peripheral pulse oximetry allow continuous non-invasive measurement arterial oxygen saturation , gold standard arterial oxygen saturation co-oximeter require arterial blood sample . The purpose research study determine accuracy pulse oximeter standard sensor ( Masimo LNCS sensor ) versus study sensor , namely Masimo blue sensor Nellcor Max-I sensor compare co-oximetry . Currently available peripheral oximeter ( standard ) inaccurate low oxygen saturation note child cyanotic heart disease .

	<detailed_description>Peripheral pulse oximetry allow continuous non-invasive measurement arterial oxygen saturation , gold standard arterial oxygen saturation co-oximeter require arterial blood sample . The purpose research study determine accuracy pulse oximeter standard sensor ( Masimo LNCS sensor ) versus study sensor , namely Masimo blue sensor Nellcor Max-I sensor compare co-oximetry . Currently available peripheral oximeter ( standard ) inaccurate low oxygen saturation note child cyanotic heart disease . Hence therapeutic intervention ( include surgery cardiac catheterization ) base solely peripheral oximetry delay inadequate . By study able establish correct limit peripheral pulse oximeter use standard study sensor . The investigator hop learn limit accuracy currently available use pulse oximeter . In child cyanotic heart disease `` blue sensor '' find small study accurate compare `` standard '' pulse oximeter . This study important provide information pulse oximeter routinely use child cyanotic heart disease ass SPO2 even blue sensor borderline therefore physician know obtain arterial blood sample co-oximeter prior planning important procedure base saturation reading .</detailed_description>
