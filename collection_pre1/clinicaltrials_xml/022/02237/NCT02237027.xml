	<brief_summary>In last year , early treatment HIV-infected individual , `` treatment prevention ( TasP ) , pre-exposure prophylaxis antiretroviral drug among HIV-negative people high-risk acquire infection ( PrEP ) emerge highly promising biological preventive intervention tackle HIV pandemic within framework combination prevention , multi-component strategy promote last five year . In West Africa , evidence strongly suggest female sex worker ( FSWs ) contribute disproportionally HIV spread . This investigator propose TasP PrEP demonstration project Benin , group involve HIV prevention research sex work milieu last two decade . After run-in phase community preparedness development specific education program adherence , investigator plan recruit 100 HIV-infected FSWs TasP component project ( woman receive first-line antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) regimen per Benin guideline ) 250 HIV-negative FSWs PrEP component ( woman receive Truvada® ) . The recruitment period last one year , follow additional one year follow-up , total follow-up period vary 12 24 month , depend give woman recruit study . During follow-up visit every three month , investigator closely monitor treatment adherence change sexual behaviour , include use viral load test among TasP participant Truvada® plasma level test PrEP participant , well detection prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) Y-chromosome DNA vaginal fluid participant . The investigator evaluate feasibility TasP PrEP set indicator , include uptake , coverage , adherence , condom migration , occurrence side effect development drug resistance , whereas mathematical modeling use predict potential impact intervention sex work milieu general population , base actual set indicator observe . The study complete economic evaluation intervention cost-effectiveness analysis .

	<brief_title>Early Antiretroviral Therapy Pre-exposure Prophylaxis HIV Prevention Among Female Sex Workers Cotonou , Benin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At end 2012 , sub-Saharan Africa home 71 % 35.3 million people live HIV worldwide . Despite preventive therapeutic effort accomplish far , epidemic persisting approximately 1,600,000 new HIV infection occur yearly region characterize different epidemiological profile . In West Africa , epidemic disproportionally concentrate among female sex worker ( FSWs ) involve directly indirectly 75 % 90 % HIV transmission case towards general population `` bridging '' population , essentially client male sexual partner . Hence , achieve control epidemic sub-region , especially West Africa epidemic much less generalized many part continent , important tailor combination prevention include behavioural , structural , biological component sex work milieu general FSWs particular , addition ensure adequate treatment already HIV-infected . However , despite substantial effort usual prevention method last 10 year effective reduction prevalence HIV sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) concomitant increase condom use country , HIV prevalence still high among FSWs West Africa , highly vulnerable woman HIV prevalence 12 time high woman reproductive age . Such situation could constitute threat progress achieve control HIV epidemic region . Recently , addition previous preventive method , consistent condom use male circumcision , early treatment ( treatment prevention , TasP ) show decrease HIV transmission 96 % serodiscordant couple , whereas pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) base Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate latter drug plus Emtricitabine ( Truvada® ) find 45 75 % protective HIV acquisition four randomized control trial use orally ; protection observe two trial conduct among woman high risk African country . These failure show mainly related issue poor adherence study drug rather poor biological efficacy . On hand , combine data several trial , level protection HIV acquisition reach 90 % among sub-groups trial participant achieve high level compliance . Based generally positive result obtain . Truvada® approve PrEP Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) USA . According Centers Disease Control Prevention , PrEP largely consider preventive individual-level intervention . However , could potentially also impact population-level help control HIV epidemic roll adopt large scale HIV prevention , especially among vulnerable population . However , feasibility approach somewhat question low treatment adherence level achieve trial recruit specifically highly vulnerable woman Africa . On hand , TasP view classical public health intervention , population-level impact largely depend coverage achieve people risk transmit HIV . However , trial demonstrate TasP efficacy carry serodiscordant couple , population treatment adherence may well high high-risk woman stable partner show low level compliance group PrEP trial . So far , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV-infected people , irrespective CD4 level clinical status ( equivalent TasP ) , recommend USA . However , World Health Organization ( WHO ) United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) recently change recommendation HIV treatment initiation HIV positive individual , increase eligibility criterion treat CD4 level reach 500 cells/mm3 compare previously recommend threshold CD4 &lt; 350 cells/mm3 . However , change far widely implement country-level . Despite proven efficacy TasP PrEP prevention strategy clinical trial , efficiency must evaluate 'real life ' situation , various country specific cultural context , largely uptake HIV testing , acceptance early treatment PrEP well drug adherence may vary considerably accord personal , social cultural characteristic , clearly reflect variability PrEP trial result . The absence clear recommendation prevention strategy different country partly due lack evidence base real world implementation especially amongst FSWs . The investigator thus propose demonstration project among FSWs Cotonou , Benin , identify best way successfully implement TasP PrEP specific set . Benin face concentrated epidemic HIV prevalence estimate 1.2 % recent general population household survey , whereas HIV prevalence estimate 21 % among FSWs late integrated biological behavioural survey ( IBBS ) carry 2012 . The project use field approach readily insert within ongoing combination prevention intervention , include clinical ( ex . : HIV test care , STI care ) , behavioural ( ex . : non-governmental organization- peer-led condom promotion ) structural component ( ex . : community empowerment , advocacy decrease police harassment ; community development activity lead constitution FSW-led community base organization ) , investigator implement close collaboration National AIDS Control Programme ( NACP ) major city towns Benin grant Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) . The Dispensaire IST ( DIST ) , STI clinic dedicate FSWs Cotonou , study clinic project . TasP make sense public health intervention long high level coverage achieve high-frequency transmitter population target intervention . Hence , TasP component project benefit ongoing CIHR/NACP intervention aim increase HIV test among FSWs . Indeed , within context , investigator currently carry study determinant regular HIV testing , base Theory plan behaviour . The result study used develop education program promote 3-monthly HIV testing among FSWs ready implement prior begin recruitment propose study . The development program use intervention mapping approach . Its implementation already plan coverage area ongoing CIHR project . The latter project also contribute define precise indicator success specifically professional FSWs ( e.g . whose main source income sex work constitute target population ) , base accurate estimation population size . Indeed , investigator currently conduct detail scientific mapping FSW population city towns cover ongoing intervention . The result size estimation study available end 2013 use establish denominator test TasP coverage indicator . Contrary TasP , PrEP individual preventive intervention coverage level less importance . However , investigator expect least 60 % HIV-negative FSWs accept PrEP , may also preventive benefit overall FSW population level . We decide combine TasP PrEP project efficiency ethical reason . Indeed , approach implies FSWs consult project clinic offer form antiretroviral drug provision adherence counseling . In addition , ethical point view consider community perspective , would difficult justify approach antiretroviral drug would give HIV-negative woman asymptomatic HIV-positive FSWs &gt; 350 CD4/mm³ treat . Note accord current Benin national guideline , ART provide free HIV-infected subject CD4 &lt; 350 CD4/mm³ , could change course study follow recently revise WHO guideline propose threshold 500 CD4/mm³ treatment eligibility . The propose project plan three year : 6-month phase-in period ( submission project relevant ethic committee , community preparedness activity , conduction study determinant intention adhere ART regimens , HIV-positive HIV-negative woman , development adherence education program base theoretical framework approach similar one use education program regular testing mention , development study procedure ) , 25-month follow-up period ( include 12 month active recruitment , follow-up vary 12 24 month ) 5-month phase-out period complete data entry , carry data analysis disseminate study result . In catchment area DIST , investigator estimate approximately 600 professional FSWs . Overall , investigator expect reach approximately 500 FSWs recruit follow-up least 90 % HIV-positive ( n~100 ) least 60 % HIV-negative PreP ( n~250 ) . Women eligible ART current guideline asymptomatic woman CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm³ ( TasP component ) offer locally approve first line ART regimens HIV-negative one ( PrEP component ) receive Truvada® . For analysis TasP , investigator compare woman enrol TasP component treat base current national guideline . Pregnant woman still breastfeed exclude PrEP component project . Women eligible ART current guideline receive drug NACP program , TasP PrEP supply drug project . In order assess potential impact combine TasP PrEP intervention , investigator first compare HIV incidence observe study 1.4 per 100 person-years incidence estimate follow-up study carry among FSWs Cotonou early 2010s . However , importantly term impact assessment , investigator use sophisticated carefully calibrate mathematical modelling technique estimate impact intervention component HIV transmission amongst FSWs , client general population , follow model impact assessment approach previously develop Cotonou evaluation Avahan , India AIDS Initiative Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation . Finally , investigator carry prospective top patient level cost data collection mainly use provider perspective approach , also patient perspective element , combine cost estimate model impact projection order estimate incremental cost-effectiveness TasP and/or PrEP per HIV infection disability adjust life year ( DALY ) avert . Regression analysis use determine patient level cost related FSW characteristic ( frequency commercial sex , level condom use , duration sex work age , CD4 cell count initiation ART ) , ART provider TasP/PrEP adherence outcome , deem important heterogeneity cost incorporate model .</detailed_description>
