	<brief_summary>The presence Left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) confers high cardiovascular risk hypertensive patient . LVH remain highly prevalent even blood pressure ( BP ) control . There increase evidence major non-haemodynamic contributor LVH oxidative stress . Allopurinol know markedly reduce oxidative stress . This pragmatic randomise double blind placebo control trial examine whether allopurinol ( 300 mg bd ) regress LV mass assess cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) 66 patient treated hypertension persist LVH . Endothelial vascular function also assess via flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) pulse wave analysis respectively ( PWA ) plasma biomarkers oxidative stress measure . The treatment ( allopurinol placebo ) last 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Allopurinol Reduce Thickening Left Ventricle Heart Patient With Treated Hypertension ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Does Allopurinol regress Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Patients Treated Essential Hypertension ? People high blood pressure increase risk heart complication . One big problem muscle wall heart thickens . The medical term Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ( LVH ) . LVH make heart less efficient patient LVH 10 time great risk heart complication without . A goal treat high blood pressure reduce strain heart try decrease thicken heart wall . However , even blood pressure treat control , LVH persist , symptom LVH go undetected . Currently way reduce LVH would lower blood pressure ( BP ) even . This cause side-effects low BP dizziness nausea . It previously show drug allopurinol , usually use treat gout remarkable side effect able reduce thicken heart wall patient kidney disease diabetes . The aim see patient high blood pressure LVH may also benefit treatment allopurinol . If LVH reduce use allopurinol , might new way reduce cardiac risk patient without need low BP even . In study aim recruit 66 patient treat well control blood pressure may still LVH . They screen LVH ultrasound scan heart confirm Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan , special scan heart use MRI machine measure extent thicken heart muscle start treatment allopurinol placebo . As clinical trial participant randomly allocate either allopurinol dummy medication ( placebo ) receive one year treatment investigator compare difference normal treatment addition allopurinol . All patient currently prescribe medication high blood pressure continue normal . They MRI scan one year treatment allopurinol placebo finish . Benefits - You monitor closely study see doctor special interest cardiology study visit medication review regular basis . The test give u information function heart , kidneys blood circulation . If investigation , include information MRI scan heart reveal new abnormality either discuss hospital consultant refer specialist clinic ( whichever seem appropriate ) . The study immediately benefit , result study positive may change practice manage patient treat high blood pressure may still LVH , like potentially great impact patient future . If , may gain eventually discover new treatment condition . Risks - The side effect allopurinol rare ( less 1 10,000 people ) include headache , stomach upset , drowsiness anaemia . Having blood test take cause mild bruising . The flow mediate dilatation may cause temporary numbness . MRI scan safe use radiation may feel bit closed . The scanner bit noisy give ear protection also play music . Your kidney function assess scan ensure safe give contrast agent describe .</detailed_description>
