	<brief_summary>Although total knee replacement ( TKR ) improve pain numerous patient , resolve many substantial functional limitation physical inactivity exist long time prior surgery . Exercise intervention could improve long-term limitation . To promote improvement , exercise implement later stage post TKR patient tolerate dos exercise sufficiently high promote substantial change . To date , n't enough good research tell u type exercise work best patient circumstance later stage post TKR . This research study provide evidence recommend intervention later stage post TKR . The specific research question : ( 1 ) How group exercise community individual exercise rehabilitation clinic compare usual medical care physical function activity outcomes ? ( 2 ) Who patient likely respond exercise intervention ? ( 3 ) Are approach safe ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This comparative effectiveness study , design 3-group single-blind randomize clinical trial . Two hundred forty old adult underwent TKR least 2 month prior otherwise eligible randomize one three treatment approach : 1 ) clinic-based individual outpatient rehabilitative exercise ; 2 ) community-based group exercise class ; 3 ) usual medical care . Subjects treat 3 month . Data collect intervention , intervention ( 3 month ) , 6 month randomization . Physical function primary outcome assess Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index battery performance-based test germane patient post TKR include ability walk , manage stair , lift floor chair , one-leg balance . We also use accelerometer-based monitor provide real-time measure physical activity normal daily living able accurately capture level activity . Linear mixed model fit compare change outcome across group . Logistic regression identify patient characteristic predict functional recovery exercise group . Survival analysis instrumental variable method use compare attrition , adherence adverse event group .</detailed_description>
