	<brief_summary>This study intend compare proximal migration tantalum design ( TM ) cement cup use conjunction bone allografting case major bone loss . A group patient good periacetabular bone stock include analyse difference tantalum titanium design regard risk loosening difference clinical outcome measure . Radiostereometry ( RSA ) use accurately measure migration rotation revision cup .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Proximal Migration Trabecular Metal Cups Used In Acetabular Revision Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetabular component loosen often associate periacetabular bone loss . Different approach describe address bone defect acetabular revision surgery . Several author report inferior result uncemented Titanium alloy old porous coat design use acetabular revision significant bone loss . Cemented fixation revision cup impaction bone grafting ( BIG ) , introduce three decade ago today thorough documentation . The Tantalum design , inherent property high volumetric porosity , low modulus elasticity high friction bone , suggest improve fixation acetabular component . Several author report promise short- medium-term result use TM design acetabular revision large periacetabular bone defect . Proximal migration measure radiostereometry ( RSA ) suggest predict risk late aseptic loosen hip prosthesis surgery . This study primarily compare proximal migration tantalum design cement cup use conjunction bone allografting case major bone loss . A group patient good periacetabular bone stock include analyse difference tantalum titanium design . RSA use accurately measure migration rotation revision cup .</detailed_description>
