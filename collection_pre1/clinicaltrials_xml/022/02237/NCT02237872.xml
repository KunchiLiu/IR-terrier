	<brief_summary>The primary goal study assess accuracy conventional fat fraction proton MRI detection Brown Adipose Tissue ( BAT ) healthy subject use FDG-PET gold standard . In pilot study , MRI PET image BAT healthy adult volunteer perform combined PET/MRI scanner mild cold condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In fight obesity , brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) consider new target . The hypothesis tissue partially responsible imbalance energy intake energy expenditure keep lean people lean obese people obese . The detection tissue adult human represent unmet need . BAT difficult detect measurement tissue fat fraction perform magnetic resonance imaging propose mean differentiate highly hydrate brown fat less hydrated white adipose tissue muscle . To end , objective study ass accuracy magnetic resonance fat fraction measurement detection BAT volume adult human , use FDG-PET gold standard . For study subject undergo combine MRI/PET scan . The scan do stimulation thermogenic activity mild cold exposure .</detailed_description>
