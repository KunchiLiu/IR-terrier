	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Versus Prednisone Heart Failure Patients , Hospitalized With Exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Open-label randomize prospective study HF patient ( NYHA grade II-VI ) , hospitalize COPD exacerbation . Eighty patient randomize 1:1 fashion conventional intervention testament group . Informed consent obtain patient prior study enrolment . The conventional therapy group receive 40mg oral prednisone daily , intervention group treat oral dexamethasone equivalent anti-inflammatory dose 6 mg/day . Glucocorticosteroids administer throughout hospitalization continue 7 day randomization . Dose change period , well subsequent taper discretion treat physician . All patient also treat short-acting bronchodilator , antibiotic , oxygen , positive pressure non-invasive mechanical ventilation VTE prophylaxis - base GOLD 2013 guideline clinical judgment attend physician . An order low sodium diet write . Discharge decision base GOLD 2013 discharge criterion list8 . Patients discharge without steroid taper regimen unless indicated clinical judgment . Tapering regimen include reduction steroid dose 5mg every 5 day 1mg every 7 day prednisone dexamethasone respectively . Patient 's demographic data document baseline ( age , sex , GOLD severity stage , data hospitalization past year , patient ' chronic drug therapy ) . On admission 14 day follow-up point , patient ' weight , height oxygen saturation measure blood drawn evaluation complete blood count , chemistry , NT proBNP level , troponin , C-reactive protein venous blood gas . The patient ask complete COPD assessment tool ( CAT ) questionnaire order quantify health status . In addition , patient undergo chest X-ray , ECG , spirometry two-dimensional echo-Doppler examination . A follow-up visit perform 14Â±2 day enrollment . The following measure obtain : weight , laboratory blood test ( please refer admission blood test ) , CAT questionnaire score documentation current diuretic dose . In addition , two-dimensional echo-doppler examination spirometry perform . After study completion , patient follow 30 day post discharge order document hospitalization .</detailed_description>
