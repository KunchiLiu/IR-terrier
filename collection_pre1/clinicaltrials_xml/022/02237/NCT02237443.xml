	<brief_summary>Anesthesia provider teach `` test '' properly ventilate patient 's lung administer neuromuscular block drug ( NMBD ) , render patient apneic . This traditional teaching , base empirical evidence . The investigator primary hypothesis ventilation administration NMBDs non-inferior administration respect composite safety endpoint inadequate ( MVi ) dead-space ( Vds ) ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following carried per routine standard care : The patient meet pre-operative area attend anesthesiologist interview examines patient . A full explanation general anesthetic include risk benefit give . Patients premedicated 1-2 mg midazolam discretion attend anesthesiologist . Once OR , standard American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) monitor establish . At minimum , include non-invasive monitoring blood pressure automate cuff , oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry , heart rate rhythm 3-lead continuous electrocardiographic tracing , core body temperature , expire carbon dioxide concentration , depth neuromuscular blockade paralytic medication use . Additional monitoring may apply deemed appropriate attend anesthesiologist case-by-case basis . At time , patient give fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg . After period breathe 100 % oxygen facemask ( typically 3 minute anesthesia monitor show exhale concentration oxygen &gt; 80 % ) primary anesthesia team judge denitrogenation sufficient , anesthesia induce intravenously propofol 2-3 mg/kg . Once patient unresponsive jaw thrust , patient ventilate via facemask . If anesthesia provider feel ability move air patient lung difficult , may reposition mask patient 's face , reposition head , neck , shoulder patient , place plastic oropharyngeal airway maintain mouth open position help keep base tongue obstruct upper airway . A drug cause muscle paralysis give , take 1-5 minute work depend drug administer ; period patient continue ventilate facemask . However , standard time administration paralytic drug anesthesia provider administer near simultaneous administration drug use induce anesthesia . Often , time , inhale anesthetic agent start avoid gap effect intravenous medication . Once muscle relaxant work , breathe tube place patient 's windpipe , ventilation occur via tube connect breathing machine . The study deviate standard anesthesia care describe follow way : Before patient arrive operate room , small plastic device call pneumotachograph place in-line facemask breathe circuit anesthesia machine . This allow measurement airway pressure volume record accurate manner later send electronically computer analysis . The in-line portion device large typical circuit connector already use hinder performance anesthesia provider way . After routine intravenous induction , patient unresponsive jaw thrust patient ventilate facemask 60 second . Breaths deliver use breathe bag anesthesia circuit would otherwise perform . The airway manager ask follow treatment algorithm resolve difficulty encounter provide mask ventilation . This algorithm represent common practice . After initial 60 second , medication induce muscle paralysis give . A nerve stimulator place patient wrist turned indicate medication take full effect patient paralyze . During period time , approximately 60-90 second , patient unconscious apneic , breathe support would otherwise do . Post-paralysis , data collection begin anesthesia provider start breathe patient via facemask described figure 2 another 60 second . The operator blind display ventilator machine , provide information amount air go patient lung , able monitor patient 's pertinent vital sign anesthesia machine . At time , one member primary anesthesia team full access monitoring would normally take place . After time , tracheal tube place surgery . Appropriate size adult facemask oropharyngeal airway determine primary anesthesia team . All breath deliver hand ventilation use breathe bag anesthesia machine . The returned tidal volume record minute study period pneumotachograph place inline anesthesia circuit level mask/elbow connector interface describe . The total time induction placement breathe tube 4-5 minute represent additional minute `` study '' time standard care . This timing chosen investigator feel provide sufficient information ventilation volume without unduly prolong anesthetic . The study coordinator remain room actual intubation record ease difficulty per report primary anesthesia provider . The act place breathe tube part study protocol , however . Data point collect : Data regard tidal volume , minute ventilation , airway pressure , end-tidal carbon dioxide record directly in-line pneumotachograph load excel spreadsheet . No manual data collection necessary . Data Safety Monitoring Plan The study may terminate primary anesthesia team one follow criterion meet : 1 . Inadequate ventilation clinical criterion ( inadequate chest rise , fog mask , positive trace end-tidal carbon dioxide and/or lack measurable return tidal volume ) . 2 . Low oxygen saturation ( &lt; 90 % ) . 3 . If reason , primary anesthesia team feel clinical judgment , immediate tracheal intubation warrant . All unanticipated problem adverse event record study sheet study coordinator . At early time , unanticipated problem adverse event examine least 2 study investigator . In event unanticipated problem adverse effect ( eg inadequate mask ventilation ) , back-up provide primary anesthesia team care patient may include place laryngeal mask airway surgical airway . These provision would make non-study case mask ventilation use one two hand represent standard practice . Statistical Considerations : The investigator aim show administration neuromuscular block agent `` safe '' respect mask ventilation . In word , average exhale tidal volume per breath one minute administration NMBD non-inferior measure administration . At time planning study , study report mean±SD tidal volume NMBDs . However , base upon prior comparative trial two different mask-hold technique , standard deviation ( SD ) average exhale tidal volume induction anesthesia , use anesthesia ventilator two-hand jaw-thrust mask hold technique 130 mL . With equivalence limit , , set 50 mL per breath , significance level ( α ) 2.5 % power ( 1-β ) 95 % , total sample size 208 patient per group ( NMBD total sample 416 study period ) require . In word , truly difference mask ventilation NMBD , 208 patient , control , require 95 % sure limit 2-sided 95 % confidence interval exclude difference mean &gt; 50 mL .</detailed_description>
