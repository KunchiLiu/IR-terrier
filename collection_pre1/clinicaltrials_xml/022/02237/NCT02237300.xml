	<brief_summary>Introduction : The purpose research develop new component cognitive-behavioral treatment ( CBT ) , empirically validate , binge eat behavior patient bulimia nervosa ( BN ) binge eat disorder ( BED ) , mean cue-exposure therapy ( CET ) virtual reality . While CBT effective treatment eat disorder , important percentage patient improve despite treatment . It necessary explore enhance effectivity usual treatment incorporation new technology procedure . The innovation investigation base use VR cue-exposure therapy , find effective patient resistant conventional treatment ( CBT pharmacological intervention ) , seek enhance efficacy increase possibility generalization provide useful tool clinician , diminish logistic complication exposure real cue ( food ) . Participants : 60 patient diagnosis BN BED accord DSM-5 proposed participation study referral mental health 's professional conducting unsuccessfully first level treatment ( CBT structure intervention ) clinical site involve participate study . Procedure : Participants active episode binge eat ( purge , case BN ) last 2 week structure intervention CBT provide detailed information study . All patient agree participate study sign inform consent form randomly assign one two second-level treatment condition : virtual reality base cue-exposure therapy ( VR-CET ) additional cognitive-behavioral treatment ( A-CBT ) . Both second-level treatment condition consist six 60-minute session hold two time per week period three week . In interview setting , participant administer several questionnaire ( BN , DT BD subscales EDI-3 , FCQ-T/S , STAI-Y ) participant assign VR-CET also expose various type virtual food different virtual environment ( kitchen , dining-room , bedroom , café ) ask food craving anxiety experience situation develop proper exposure hierarchy accord specific characteristic needs patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample Sixty patient diagnose BN BED accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) find resistant initial structure program CBT ( Fairburn , Marcus , &amp; Wilson , 1993 ) participate study . Participants recruit collaborate hospital health center include Hospital de Bellvitge ( Barcelona , Spain ) , Adult Mental Health Center Consorcio Sanitario de la Anoia ( Igualada , Spain ) , Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII ( Tarragona , Spain ) , Centro ABB ( Tarragona , Spain ) Instituto Auxologico Italiano ( Milano , Italy ) . Suicidal ideation diagnosis severe mental disorder ( substance use disorder , bipolar disorder , psychosis ) exclusion criterion . Patients active episode binge eat ( purge , case BN ) last two week structure program CBT consider participation study . All prospective participant comprehensively inform characteristic study require sign inform consent form . Authorization research ethic committee applicant organization ( University Barcelona ) collaborate institution require . Patients agree participate study randomly assign one two second-level treatment condition : VR-CET group receive cue-exposure session use VR environment ( six 60-minute ( maximum ) session course three week ; two per week ) A-CBT group receive six additional session usual cognitive behavioral treatment . Consistent American Psychological Association CONSORT guideline recommendation regard sample size type research , 30 patient include group . If necessary , dropout case replace . Procedure At end first level treatment structure program CBT , patient assess relative status complete several questionnaire ( BN , DT BD subscales EDI-3 , FCQ-T/S , STAI-Y ) ( pre-randomization assessment ) . Those active behavioral symptom agree participate intervention study sign informed consent form randomly assign one two second-level treatment condition : VR-CET A-CBT session . Also , participant assign VR-CET condition assess validated VR-based cue exposure software ( Gutiérrez-Maldonado , Pla-Sanjuanelo et al. , 2016 ) order construct exposure hierarchy 3D interactive ( environment food ) situation , use VR-CET session . For , participant assign VR-CET condition : 1 . Will expose 30 graphic representation different food . The level crave elicit food assess mean visual analog scale ( VAS ) range 0 ( ) 100 ( extreme ) . 2 . These participant also expose four graphic representation different environment ( kitchen , din room , bedroom , café ) . The level crave elicit environment assess mean VAS range 0 ( ) 100 ( extreme ) . 3 . They individually expose ten different virtual food assess elicit high level crave four virtual environment ( kitchen , din room , bedroom , café ) total 40 virtual situation low high crave score previously register phase 1 2 . Once virtual situation , participant ask sit virtual table food place . Once participant sits , time measure . During first 20 second , patient handle virtual food mean laptop 's mouse eat food . When time run , level crave anxiety assess mean visual analog scale range 0 ( ) 100 ( extreme ) . Virtual environment display mean 3D laptop specific software capable create stereoscopic effect duly process polarized glass . Headphones also use . This assessment conduct quiet darkened room increase participant 's immersion virtual scenario . The therapist remain behind patient assessment interfere task available event participant require assistance . 4 . Anxiety score obtain 40 situation use develop exposure hierarchy use VR-CET session . Virtual reality base cue-exposure therapy ( VR-CET ) session : There six 60-minute ( maximum ) exposure session ( two session per week three week ) . Participants ( n=30 ) expose different VR environment related binge behavior , accord previously construct hierarchy . During exposure , patient face high risk situation diminish extinguish condition response anxiety expose food relate cue . In session , patient expose corresponding step hierarchy . Additional cognitive-behavioral treatment ( A-CBT ) session : Participants ( n=30 ) condition receive six CBT booster session ( twice weekly ) course three week improve output treatment . CBT session base approach describe Eldredge colleague ( Eldredge et al. , 1997 ) . In treatment , patient train self-monitor food pattern identify manage thought , emotion , environmental factor relate disrupt eating behavior . VR base cue-exposure booster sessions The cue-exposure procedure use study adaptation cue-exposure treatment BN propose Martinez-Mallen et al . ( 2007 ) . Exposure session conduct individually quiet , darkened room . In session , participant sit front 3D laptop software capable create stereoscopic effect duly process polarized glass . Headphones active noise cancellation also use expose participant auditory stimulus virtual environment , time , isolate patient external noise . Participants interact within virtual environment real time . They move around scenario , sit table , handle food display use keyboard laptop 's mouse . During first minute session , patient remind purpose exposure , , place contact food despite high level anxiety experience . Doubts question raise participant attend time . The participant expose correspond virtual environment food base previously establish hierarchy . Along VR-CET session , crave anxiety level assess periodically . Exposure terminate subjective anxiety decrease 40 % relation level register initiation exposure session 60 minute . Once anxiety level decrease significantly , patient expose next level hierarchy . In event session terminate anxiety level sufficiently reduce virtual situation , patient expose situation follow session . Subjective craving anxiety record use visual analogic scale ( VAS ) range 0 ( ) 100 ( extreme ) beginning , every minute , end virtual scenario exposure . During exposure , therapist remain behind patient intervene instruction need patient need assistance . Assessment During VR-CET session , subjective crave anxiety assess use VAS ( range 0 100 ) record beginning , every minute , end exposure . The following questionnaire administer participant two group initiate treatment ( pre-randomization phase ) , end second level-level treatment condition , six-month follow-up : STAI-Y ( State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y ) , BN , DT BD subscales EDI-3 ( Eating Disorders Inventory-3 ) FCQ-T/S ( Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait/State ) . Finally , outcome assessment core behavioural feature include frequency ( i.e. , number ) binge eat episode purge two week prior begin second-level treatment condition , two week end intervention , two week six-month follow-up . Data analyse Mixed between-within subject analysis variance conduct . Between-subject variable refers condition , VR-CET versus A-CBT . The within-subject variable refers assessment time : prior begin second-level treatment condition ( VR-CET A-CBT condition ) , end treatment , six-month follow-up . Thus , comparison result obtain group treatment , treatment follow-up assess measure conduct . Using similar analysis , anxiety measure register exposure session also compare . A significant interaction condition ( VR-CET vs. A-CBT ) time expect first block analysis . This would indicate result questionnaires well number binge purge would remain stable second-level treatment condition ( pre-randomization phase ) , treatment follow-up control group ( A-CBT ) , whereas measure would reduce experimental group ( VR-CET ) treatment follow-up . In second analysis block , expect measure subjective anxiety decrease exposure session progress .</detailed_description>
