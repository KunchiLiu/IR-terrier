	<brief_summary>While significant advance pain management occur last 20 year , majority patient chronic pain ( CP ) unable access evidence-based treatment either primary tertiary care level . Moreover , research show unrelieved CP lack available expertise contribute emergency department ( ED ) visit hospital admission . At The Ottawa Hospital ( TOH ) , close 18,000 ED visit per year relate CP ( 12.9 % ) . Among high frequency visitor ( HFV ; &gt; = 8 visit per year ) , small number patient CP use inordinate amount acute care resource . The investigator study use randomize control ( RCT ) design conduct pilot evaluation impact Complex Interdisciplinary Pain Assessment Program ( CIPAP ) link primary care physician ( PCP ) compare treatment usual ( TAU ) control arm . The investigator hypothesis implement CIPAP increase health care value improve patient outcome reduce cost HFV chronic pain ( CP-HFV ) . The investigator believe CIPAP provide CP-HFV patient long-term pain management solution , ED visit CP reduce , hospital admission CP prevent . This pilot RCT study inform larger-scale RCT study conduct future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As phase 2 trial , sample size primarily determine logistical constraint ; however , trial yield valuable information preliminary impact program planning large , definitive trial future , determine maximum width two-sided 95 % confidence interval around difference arm 12 month . For self-report measure , 18 patient per arm would yield margin error 0.65 standard deviation ( total width confidence interval = 1.3 standard deviation unit scale ) , consider acceptable self-report measure . For number visit 3 month , assume standard deviation 3 ( base preliminary data ) . Assuming approximate normality , sample size 18 patient per arm would yield margin error 2 visit ( total width confidence interval = 4 visit ) adequate yield preliminary evidence change . These conservative estimate analysis include repeated measure , adjust baseline measure response addition demographic clinical covariates . To account 20 % attrition , plan enrol 23 participant per arm ( total number participant =46 ) .</detailed_description>
