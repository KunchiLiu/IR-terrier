	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Live-Attenuated Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) Vaccine RSV-Seronegative Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RSV common viral cause serious acute lower respiratory illness ( LRI ) infants child 5 year age world . RSV illness range mild upper respiratory tract illness ( URI ) severe LRI , include bronchiolitis pneumonia . Severe RSV disease infancy may also predispose child develop reactive airway disease childhood . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity RSV vaccine ( RSV LID ΔM2-2 ) RSV-seronegative infant child least 6 month 24 month age . To determine study eligibility , screen process include blood collection . Screening may begin RSV season ( i.e. , April 1 ) enrollment must precede RSV season ( late October 14 ) . At study entry , eligible participant randomly assign receive one dose either RSV vaccine placebo , deliver nose drop . Participants also undergo review medical history , clinical assessment , nasal wash . They receive assign vaccine remain observation monitoring 30 minute receive vaccine . Additional study visit occur Days 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 28 , 56 . These visit include clinical assessment nasal wash ; Day 56 , blood collection also occur . On day study visit schedule ( Day 29 ) , participant ' parent guardian report participant ' temperature sign illness researcher e-mail phone . In October follow vaccination , participant may pre-RSV season blood collection visit . During RSV season , November March follow vaccination , researcher contact participant ' parent guardian weekly basis follow-up monitoring . During time frame , participant see medical provider fever , respiratory illness , otitis medium study visit , include nasal wash clinical assessment . In April follow vaccination , participant undergo final blood collection .</detailed_description>
