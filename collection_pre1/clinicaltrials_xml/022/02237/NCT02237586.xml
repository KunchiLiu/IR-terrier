	<brief_summary>The study design establish infectivity Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite ( PfSPZ ) via intravenous ( IV ) administration three group different malaria immunity-status : 1 . Adults history lifelong malaria exposure without sickle cell trait ( HbAA ) 2 . Adults history lifelong malaria exposure sickle cell trait ( HbAS ) 3 . Adults without previous malaria episode without sickle cell trait ( HbAA ) Initially dose 3,200 PfSPZ give time thick blood smear positivity challenge assess . If group history lifelong malaria exposure , 50 % less individual become thick blood smear positive 28 day post injection PfSPZ Challenge , dose increase 4-fold 12,800 PfSPZ group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>LACHMI-001 partially-blinded , human pilot trial study immunity P. falciparum malaria control infection setting . The main objective characterise role sickle cell trait naturally acquire immunity development malaria , define positive smear P. falciparum sign symptom associate malaria . Three group volunteer receive radical cure treatment subsequently PfSPZ Challenge IV administration . The group : 1 . Adults naturally acquire immunity HbAA ( Group IA , n=10-20 ) 2 . Adults naturally acquire immunity HbAS ( Group IS , n=10-20 ) 3 . Adults without previous exposure malaria HbAA ( Group NI , n=5 ) The initial challenge dose 3,200 PfSPZ administer intravenously lead consistent infection naïve adult ( 15/15 prior study ) thus infect volunteer Group 3 . However , volunteer naturally acquire immunity sickle cell trait might require high dose . Thus 50 % less volunteer become parasitemic Groups IA IS , 10 additional volunteer enrol challenge 12,800 PfSPZ . All volunteer healthy adult age 18 30 year . Safety infectivity data collect regimens dose-levels . Effective treatment initiate immediately upon development parasitemia together presence symptom associate malaria . Laboratory staff read blood film process sample blind group allocation . Volunteers clinical investigator blind group allocation among IA IS group .</detailed_description>
