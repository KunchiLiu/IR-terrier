	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Outcomes Cardiac Surgery ( DOCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 694,000 open-heart surgery perform US year . The major complication rate valve plus coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedure high 30.1 % Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) report . Postoperative delirium , infection , acute renal failure ( ARF ) major adverse cardiocerebral event ( MACE ) include permanent transient stroke , coma , perioperative myocardial infarction ( MI ) , heart block cardiac arrest represent major postoperative complication . These complication translate increase mortality prolong hospital stay estimate cost exceed $ 20 billion annually.6 The etiology adverse event multifactorial , one major contribute factor surgical stress response result increase plasma level epinephrine norepinephrine , consequent myocardial oxygen supply demand imbalance myocardial ischemia . More 50 % perioperative complication related adverse cardiovascular event . The alpha-2 receptor agonist ( clonidine , dexmedetomidine ) currently use clinical practice many desirable effect may provide myocardial protection include analgesia , anxiolysis , inhibition central sympathetic outflow reduction systemic norepinephrine release improve hemodynamic stability positively affect myocardial oxygen supply demand . The widely study alpha-2 agonist clonidine , long-acting partial agonist alpha-2 alpha-1 selectivity ratio 39:1 . However , dexmedetomidine highly selective , shorter-acting intravenous alpha-2 agonist alpha-2 alpha-1 selectivity ratio 1300:1 . Multiple study report dexmedetomidine protective effect specific organ include heart , brain , kidney lung . In addition , dexmedetomidine show anti-inflammatory property decrease mortality attenuate plasma cytokine concentration laboratory animal expose endotoxin dose-dependent fashion . The investigator hypothesize dexmedetomidine may provide myocardial , brain , renal immune function protection cardiovascular surgical patient . The specific aim study investigate whether perioperative use dexmedetomidine associate improved outcome decrease incidence postoperative mortality , MACE complications patient undergo open-heart surgery .</detailed_description>
