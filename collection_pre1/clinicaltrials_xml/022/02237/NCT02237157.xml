	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Safety Study Locally-Delivered Gemcitabine Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose unresectable pancreatic cancer may may prior chemotherapy radiation therapy may eligible enroll dose escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose gemcitabine deliver locally pancreatic tumor use RenovoCath R120 catheter . Patients enrol may receive 8 catheterization deliver gemcitabine directly pancreatic tumor start reduce dose ( 1/4 standard i.v . gemcitabine dose ) , every two dos , increase dose 25 % toxicity maximum dose 1000 mg/m2 . There four cycle , two dos per cycle . Imaging study conduct well assessment standard , myelosuppresive gastric toxicity assess . Pain also measure throughout study .</detailed_description>
