	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity inhalational iloprost placebo administer cohort patient daily 2 month , give four time day ( QID ) Cohort A follow twice daily ( BID ) Cohort B . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate compliance BID QID dose regimen . II . To evaluate effect endobronchial histology . III . To evaluate effect serum protein , include adiponectin , C1Q collagen domain containing ( ADIPOQ ) , C9 , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) synthase , hydrogen ( H+ ) transporting , mitochondrial F1 complex , beta polypeptide ( ATP5B ) , carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 ( CHST15 ) , sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 ( HNRNPA2B1 ) , quantitated highly multiplexed aptamer base analysis measure approximately 1500 protein . IV . To evaluate effect endobronchial brushing biopsy gene expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , glutathione S-transferase mu ( GSTmu ) , carboxylesterase 1 ( Ces1 ) , Fos-related antigen 1 ( FosL1 ) , cytochrome p4502e1 , stearoyl coA desaturase 1 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) superfamily member 9 , transform growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) , Jun 46 gene panel associate dysplasia persistence , use Affymetrix array . V. To evaluate improvement chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) measure arterial blood gas ( ABG ) ( improve ventilation perfusion match ) , pulmonary function testing , 6 minute walk distance , quality life ( St. George 's respiratory questionnaire , COPD assessment test [ CAT ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients enrol Cohort A completion prior initiation Cohort B. COHORT A : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive iloprost via inhalation use nebulizer QID 60 day . ARM II : Patients receive placebo via inhalation use nebulizer QID 60 day . COHORT B : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM III : Patients receive iloprost via inhalation use nebulizer BID 60 day . ARM IV : Patients receive placebo via inhalation use nebulizer BID 60 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 60 , 90 day annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
