	<brief_summary>The clinical trial part large study evaluate safety efficacy screen technique cervical cancer among HIV-infected woman . The investigator randomize woman undergo screen Visual Inspection Acetic Acid ( VIA ) Visual Inspection Lugol 's Iodine ( VILI ) , along colposcopy . All outcome treatment decision base colposcopy exam do study visit . The investigator compare outcomes two group assess test characteristic VIA VILI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer HIV intersect epidemic disproportionately affect low-income woman ; impact socioeconomic disparity biologic synergy two disease see dramatically Kenya , cervical cancer common cancer killer . HIV-infected woman increase risk development cervical precancer cancer , develop aggressive lesion affect young age . Although screen treatment precancer reduce incidence cervical cancer close zero resource-rich country , strategy costly available resource-limited country . Novel test treatment method carry low-resource setting urgently need prevent cervical cancer setting , especially among HIV-infected woman . Using cross-sectional study design , investigator test two potentially low-cost effective cervical cancer screen method : visual inspection acetic acid ( VIA ) protein biomarkers express presence cervical dysplasia , neither well-studied HIV-infected woman . Investigators also randomize small subset woman undergo VIA compare Visual Inspection Lugol 's Iodine ( VILI ) compare test characteristic two screen exam . In addition , remarkably little known potential impact presence , diagnosis treatment human papillomavirus-related dysplasia HIV genital shedding , major risk factor HIV transmission . To explore impact presence , diagnosis treatment human papillomavirus-related cervical dysplasia HIV-1 genital secretion , investigator compare level HIV-1 RNA find cervicovaginal secretion woman evidence cervical dysplasia level woman high-grade cervical dysplasia . They also compare level HIV-1 RNA prior cervical biopsy well 14 week standard treatment cervical dysplasia use loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) . Results study inform prioritization design safe , effective low-cost cervical cancer screen prevention program HIV-infected</detailed_description>
