	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : - compare diagnostic performance emergency compression ultrasonography perform ultra-portable device ( V-Scan® ) emergency compression ultrasonography perform classic device - compare diagnostic performance emergency compression ultrasonography patient suspect DVT arrive emergency department versus similar patient send generalist - compare diagnostic performance emergency compression ultrasonography among patient suspect DVT accord pre clinical probability test base Wells score ( low , medium high probability ) . Currently , use ultra-portable ultrasound indication part routine care , study therefore consider interventional nature .</detailed_description>
