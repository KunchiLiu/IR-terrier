	<brief_title>Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Your participation study require allow surgical team use fat pad knee usually discard surgery harvest regenerative cell . The fat pad process use Transpose RTTM system ( InGeneron , Inc. , Houston , TX , USA ) produce adipose-derived regenerative cell . These cell re-injected knee surgery . These cell may encourage heal surgical site , although whether much encourage heal unknown . Determining whether improve healing occur purpose study . All patient infrapatellar fat pad remove part normal total knee arthroplasty surgery . Some patient fat pad process cell insert back knee . Other patient saline insert knee manner fat pad cell . To group patients/participants would assign determined random process , similar flipping coin . The surgery way patient . Your participation require attend regularly schedule postoperative visit . You make extra clinic visit study . After leave hospital , ask rate pain daily return first postoperative visit 7-10 day . At postoperative visit 7-10 day , 1 month 3 month , ask fill short questionnaire knee swelling , range motion function evaluate Dr. Burke .
