	<brief_summary>Background : - Generalized lipodystrophy cause high blood fat level resistance insulin . This lead health problem include diabetes . Researchers find drug metreleptin improve health people disease . Objective : - To test safety effectiveness metreleptin . Eligibility : - People age 6 month old generalize lipodystrophy : - receive metreleptin NIH study AND - get approved compassionate use mechanisms home country . Design : - Participants come NIH approximately every 6 month year one , every 1 2 year . Financial assistance may available travel within U.S. - At visit , participant get supply metreleptin take home daily injection . They : - plastic catheter place arm vein . - blood test , urine collection , physical exam . - oral glucose tolerance test , drink sweet liquid . - ultrasound heart , liver , uterus , ovary . A gel probe place skin picture take organ . - echocardiogram , take picture heart sound wave . - Resting Metabolic Rate take . A plastic hood worn head oxygen breathe measure . - Participants 3 DEXA scan x-ray per year . - Participants may : - annual bone x-ray . - liver biopsy every year . A needle insert liver obtain small piece . Participants sign separate consent . - Participants must see regularly local doctor blood test least every 3 6 month home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leptin adipocyte-derived hormone think signal adipose tissue rest body convey information long-term nutritional status . Patients rare condition generalize lipodystrophy leptin deficiency secondary lack adipose tissue . The combination leptin deficiency ectopic lipid deposition patient lipodystrophy lead metabolic complication include severe insulin resistance diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , polycystic ovarian syndrome . Between 2000 2014 , NIDDK IRP conduct open-label clinical trial recombinant human leptin analog , metreleptin , patient generalize partial form lipodystrophy . This study show metreleptin ameliorates metabolic endocrine abnormality lipodystrophy , include reduce food intake , improve insulin resistance diabetes , reduce ectopic lipid , normalize reproduction . Based data , metreleptin approve FDA February , 2014 , patient generalize , partial , lipodystrophy . Currently , metreleptin available approve drug outside US Japan , available compassionate use basis additional country . The purpose study twofold : 1 . To provide access metreleptin patient generalize lipodystrophy , include previously receive metreleptin NIH study ( protocols 02-DK-0022 13-DK- 0057 ) AND/OR obtain metreleptin approved compassionate use mechanisms home country 2 . To continue collect data long-term efficacy metreleptin ameliorate metabolic complication generalize lipodystrophy . Metreleptin give dose less equal 0.24 mg/kg/day , adjust base body weight metabolic control . Patients see approximately per year NIH evaluation , potentially less frequently medically stable difficulty travel US . Laboratory evaluation obtain frequently patient home provider clinically indicate . The primary outcome study improvement serum triglyceride hemoglobin A1c level . Secondary outcome include measure steatohepatitis ectopic lipid , body composition , bone mineral density bone mineral metabolism , pituitary reproductive function . Metreleptin supply Aegerion Pharmaceuticals . Neither NIH Aegerion Pharmaceuticals guarantee leptin available patient indefinitely and/or study end .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age great equal 6 month . 2 . Generalized lipodystrophy ( either congenital acquire ) . 3 . Those obtain metreleptin approved compassionate use mechanisms home country . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Availability metreleptin patient either approve drug , local compassionate use expand access program . 2 . Known HIV infection HIVassociated lipodystrophy . 3 . Any medical condition medication increase risk subject . 4 . Current alcohol substance abuse . 5 . Subjects know hypersensitivity E. coli derive protein ( leptin derive protein ) .</criteria>
