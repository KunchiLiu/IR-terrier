	<brief_summary>Patients extensive disease ( ED ) small cell lung cancer still dismal prognosis , even though first line chemotherapy show 70 % response rate . Most patient relapse 6 month chemotherapy follow therapy second line chemotherapy limit efficacy patient . Currently , standard 3rd line therapy patient ED small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . As investigator know , Nab-paclitaxel show promising efficacy several case report patient SCLC , aim clinical trial investigate efficacy safety nab-paclitaxel single agent SCLC patient extensive disease fail first line/ second line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
