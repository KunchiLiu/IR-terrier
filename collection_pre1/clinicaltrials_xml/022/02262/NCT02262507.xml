	<brief_summary>Significant morbidity , mortality , related cost cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . A simple , effective , lightweight device worn athletes war fighter field , design mitigate TBI result blast trauma concussive event , would save life , huge cost currently experience life-treatment surviving victim . An externally-worn medical device applies mild jugular compression accord principle Queckenstedt Maneuver ( Device ) develop Q30 Labs , LLC ( Q30 ) . Initial research suggest Device potential reduce likelihood TBI . The rationale testing wideband absorbance Oto-acoustics emission ( OAE ) investigator need physiologic , non-invasive method evaluate brain response mild jugular compression across multiple age group . To determine MR image currently cost prohibitive . The investigator pilot data parent IRB indicate consistent response measure via wideband absorbance young adult . Therefore , preliminary step evaluate safety efficacy neck collar device employ technology across wide range age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For test session , subject may either come test site investigator may bring test location ( e.g . school , work ) . The subject fit device around neck , like neck tie . The Device incorporate two bulge localize site internal jugular vein bilaterally . Experiments perform jugular Doppler ultrasound demonstrate wearing Device , flow within jugular vein reduce , flow within carotid artery portion cerebrum preserve ( JA Fisher , unpublished data ) . Thus , application Device subject cause untoward health risk ( IRB # 2013-2240 safety test performed Device ) . The pressure exert Device region neck superficial internal jugular vein akin pressure felt person yawn wear snugly fitting necktie . The method utilized prior approve IRB ( 2013-2240 ) .. Station I : Consent Participate Each participant review Institutional Review Board approve consent participate form prior data collection . They give adequate amount time ask question study coordinator , person obtain consent , make decision participate participate . If wish participate , ask sign inform consent form . For middle school high school subject recruit via investigator relationship school , station designate review consent assent form ensure proper signature obtain . Station II : Device Fitting Ultrasound The subject outfit device staff member appropriately train fitting device proper location . Station III : Wideband Absorbance Oto-Acoustic Emissions This station help determine effectiveness device measure auditory response click noise non-invasively imparted subject 's outer ear . For test , soft silicone tip place out ear , sound delivered via miniature speaker . For wideband absorbance test , absorb acoustic response monitor provide information operation collar device . These measure change acoustic absorbance ear . For oto-acoustic emission test , tone click present ear soft ear probe record microphone pick oto-acoustic emission come back outer hair cell inner ear . The computer average process response reference noise floor across specified frequency range , display result computer screen tester . The oto-acoustic emission test also provide brief hear screen determine hearing normal . Evidence indicate wideband absorbance oto-acoustic emission alter increase intracranial pressure , thus simple , non-invasive exam provide feedback effectiveness device . During wideband absorbance oto-acoustic emission test study participant also fit compressive circumferential neck collar provide variable specific level pressure . The pressure achieve inflatable pod sit adjacent trachea affix non-stretch adjustable collar . Manual inflation regulate monitored experience operator/ technician bulb style pump electronic gauge . Testing occur without pressure pressure apply 40mmHg . Station IV : Hearing Assessment Otoscopy perform audiologist note ear blockage , wax drainage exclusion purpose . The oto-acoustic emission test interpret determine normal response obtain ear . If abnormal , hear screen use pure tone audiometry screen provide free charge . In event hearing screening determine abnormal , subject receive result may share primary care provider determine need referral follow-up . If subject see follow-up CCHMC follow abnormal hear assessment , visit follow visit pay project subject insurance billing .</detailed_description>
