	<brief_summary>The study conduct 2 Stages . The primary objective Stage 1 study identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MOR209/ES414 administer intravenously patient mCRPC . Secondary objective evaluate tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , immunogenicity , cytokine response , clinical activity MOR209/ES414 . The primary objective Stage 2 study evaluate clinical activity MOR209/ES414 patient receive prior chemotherapy . Secondary objective characterize safety profile , PK , PD , immunogenicity MOR209/ES414 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage 1 - Dose Escalation : The dose escalation stage study test weekly dos 0.2 mcg/kg 300 mcg/kg 9 dose level ( cohort ) . Cohorts 1 3 consist single patient Cohorts 4 - 9 consist minimum 3 patient ; additional 3 patient may add cohort adverse event possibly relate MOR209/ES414 dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) occur . The next dose cohort enroll patient ( ) current dose cohort complete first cycle dosing ( 4 week ) significant adverse event DLTs . Six patient enrol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose use Stage 2 . Stage 2 - Expansion : The continuous intravenous infusion MTD dose regimen examine 2 expansion cohort ; first cohort patient receive prior chemotherapy , docetaxel mCRPC , second cohort receive prior chemotherapy mCRPC . Serum sample collect serial PK assessment MOR/209ES414 drug level antibody formation . Response assess every 2 month first 6 month treatment every 3 month progression mCRPC , intolerable side effect , withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
