	<brief_summary>Background : - Partial lipodystrophy cause high blood fat level resistance insulin . This lead health problem include diabetes . Researchers find drug metreleptin improve health people disease . Objective : - To test safety effectiveness metreleptin . Eligibility : - People age 6 month old partial lipodystrophy - receive metreleptin NIH study show improvement AND - get metreleptin way . Design : - Participants come NIH approximately every 6 month year one , every 1 2 year . Financial assistance may available travel within U.S. - At visit , participant get supply metreleptin take home daily injection , ship inside U.S . They : - plastic catheter place arm vein . - blood test , urine collection , physical exam . - oral glucose tolerance test , drink sweet liquid . - ultrasound heart , liver , uterus , ovary . A gel probe place skin picture take organ . - echocardiogram , take picture heart sound wave . - Resting Metabolic Rate take . A plastic hood worn head oxygen breathe measure . - Participants 3 DEXA scan x-ray per year . - Participants may : - annual bone x-ray . - liver biopsy every year . A needle insert liver obtain small piece . Participants sign separate consent . - Participants must see regularly local doctor blood test least every 3-6 month home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leptin adipocyte-derived hormone think signal adipose tissue rest body convey information long-term nutritional status . Patients lipodystrophy leptin deficiency secondary lack adipose tissue . The combination leptin deficiency ectopic lipid deposition patient lipodystrophy lead metabolic complication include severe insulin resistance diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , polycystic ovarian syndrome . Between 2000 2014 , NIDDK IRP conduct open-label clinical trial recombinant human leptin analog , metreleptin , patient generalize partial form lipodystrophy . This study show metreleptin ameliorates metabolic endocrine abnormality lipodystrophy , include reduce food intake , improve insulin resistance diabetes , reduce ectopic lipid , normalize reproduction . Based data , metreleptin approve FDA February , 2014 , patient generalize , partial , lipodystrophy . Our data show , however , subgroup patient partial lipodystrophy gain medical benefit metreleptin . The purpose study twofold : - To provide access metreleptin patient partial lipodystrophy previously receive derived benefit metreleptin NIH study ( protocols 02-DK-0022 13-DK-0057 ) . - To continue collect data long-term efficacy metreleptin ameliorate metabolic complication partial lipodystrophy . Metreleptin give dose less equal 0.24 mg/kg/day , adjust base body weight metabolic control . Patients see approximately per year NIH evaluation , potentially less frequently medically stable difficulty travel NIH . Laboratory evaluation obtain frequently patient home provider clinically indicate . The primary outcome study improvement serum triglyceride hemoglobin A1c level . Secondary outcome include measure steatohepatitis ectopic lipid , body composition , bone mineral density bone mineral metabolism , pituitary reproductive function . Metreleptin supply Aegerion Pharmaceuticals , Incorporated . Neither NIH Aegerion Pharmaceuticals guarantee leptin available indefinitely and/or study end .</detailed_description>
