	<brief_summary>In-Vitro Fertilisation ( IVF ) term commonly apply form treatment infertility involve control ovarian hyperstimulation , egg maturation , egg collection , fertilisation , embryo culture finally embryo transfer . The period egg collection call luteal phase . In Australia , vaginal progesterone routinely use support line uterus susceptible implantation embryo . More recently , suggestion additional supplementation luteal phase GnRH agonist increase clinical pregnancy live birth rate . These study however heterogeneous result inconsistent . This study prospective randomise control trial additional GnRH agonist luteal phase antagonist cycle . The primary hypothesis GnRH agonist increase number live birth . The secondary hypothesis increase clinical pregnancy rate , on-going pregnancy rate , without affect miscarriage rate , ovarian hyperstimulation rate multiple pregnancy rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In-vitro fertilization use since 1978 treat woman infertility . It involve control ovarian stimulation , egg maturation , egg collection , fertilization embryo culture finally embryo culture . The luteal phase latter phase menstrual cycle begin formation corpus lutea end either pregnancy luteolysis . The main hormone associate stage progesterone , significantly high luteal phase phase cycle . In IVF setting , however , luteal phase deficiency present last 40 year various regimen use support luteal phase cycle . Progesterone currently widely use purpose show effective improving pregnancy live birth rate ( Van der Linden 2011 ) . There various regimen use luteal support attempt enhance luteal phase support oestrogen , HCG GnRH agonist . The recent Cochrane study show significant benefit addition GnRH agonist progesterone versus progesterone alone outcomes live birth , clinical pregnancy ongoing pregnancy . ( Van Der Linden 2011 ) However , conclusion derive metaanalysis derive limited number study use various type additional luteal phase support , also include myriad agonist antagonist IVF cycle . Only ICSI cycle include antagonist cycle . A gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist synthetic peptide interacts GnRH hormone receptor elicit biologic response , release pituitary hormone , FHS LH . The exact mechanism GnRH could potentially increase pregnancy rate unknown . Tesarik et al perform randomise study addition GnRH agonist increase implantation rate donor recipient discount theory GnRH act corpora lutea . It suggest GnRH act directly embryo secrete BHCG hence enhances implantation . A prospective randomise study perform Isik et al show promising result use GnRH agonist administration luteal phase GnRH antagonist cycle ( n=164 ) . In study , case receive 0.5mg leuprolide acetate addition 600mg micronised progesterone day 6 ICSI compare control group receive micronisd progesterone . The study show clinical pregnancy rate 40 % case vs 20 % control group . The increased number multiple pregnancy study could partly explain multiple embryo transfer . Answer need determine multiple pregnancy rate high single embryo transfer execute . The study perform Tesarik et al Isik et al show promising increase live birth rate clinical pregnancy rate antagonist cycle . Both study perform clinical setting vastly different Australia : multiple embryo transfer , multiple luteal phase support use addition progesterone multiple pregnancy rate high . Given significant increase pregnancy rate ( &gt; 10 % ) observe study , increase real , RCT Australia set need prior implementation intervention .</detailed_description>
