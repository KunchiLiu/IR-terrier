	<detailed_description>The choice time follow visit patient perform randomization tailor single patient accordance NCCN AIOCC guideline follow scheduling : - Oral Cavity cancer : every 2 month 1st year , every 3 month 2nd year , every 4 month 3rd year every 6 month 4th 5th year - Oropharyngeal laryngeal cancer : every 3 month 1st 2nd year , every 4 month 3rd year every 6 month 4th 5th year - Hypopharyngeal cancer : every 3 month 1st 2nd year , every 6 month 3rd 5th year Patients deem complete remission month 6 ( +/- 1 month ) curative treatment randomize two follow arm : ARM A ( Non intensive ) : follow accord NCCN guideline , consist outpatient visit accord schedule foreseen single head neck subsite . At follow visit patient report new symptom receive physical fiberoptic endoscopic head neck examination . Laboratory test ( complete blood count , renal , hepatic thyroid function ) perform year . Quality life questionnaire ( EuroQol 5D5L , EORTC QLQ C-30 HN35 ) administer patient every visit first 2 year visit . During visit , socio-economic questionnaire also administer . Locoregional imaging perform within 6 month treatment end recommend occurrence new sign symptom . Only patient arm contact phone call visit order monitor patient 's report symptom could potentially related disease recurrence . ARM B ( Intensive ) : follow outpatient visit perform similarly ARM A , include physical fiberoptic endoscopic head neck evaluation laboratory test questionnaire . Locoregional imaging request patient 2 times/year first 2 year 1 time/year third fourth year ; PET scan request yearly first 3 year . In first year RT end , MRI CT scan perform screen sixth month enrollment , PET scan perform six month enrollment . Radiological image PET customize accord smoke history perform subject &gt; 50 year smoke history &gt; 20 pack/years . Randomization stratify accord site primary disease , smoke history ( &gt; 10pack year ) likelihood feasibility non feasibility salvage surgery recurrence T/N level would emerge ( salvage surgery feasibility ) .</detailed_description>
