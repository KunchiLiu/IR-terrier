	<brief_title>Inhaled Sodium Nitrite Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer cardiac catheterization laboratory invasive exercise stress test prospectively recruit . Standard right heart catheterization use high fidelity micromanometers ( Millar Instruments ) perform rest supine exercise simultaneous expire gas analysis ( Medgraphics ) investigator 's current practice . The protocol restâ€”passive leg elevation -- 20 Watts exercise x 5 minute , grade workload increase 10Watt increment ( 3 minute stage ) exhaustion . Hemodynamic , arterial mixed venous blood gas expire gas data acquire rest , exercise stage peak exercise . Venous blood sample obtain rest peak exercise . Perceived symptom dyspnea fatigue quantify use Borg dyspnea effort score stage exercise . After initial exercise study hemodynamics return baseline , previously prepared study drug ( normal saline placebo Sodium Nitrite Inhalation Solution ( AIR001 ) 90mg place medication chamber ) nebulized utilizing Aerogen Solo-Idehaler 10-15 minute . After 15 minute observation period post completion nebulization , rest hemodynamic expire gas data acquire exactly initial run . Subjects repeat leg elevation-20 Watt x 5 minute exercise phase . Blood sample obtain rest exercise . Subjects repeat exercise 20 Watt stage , rather repeat entire study . This do increase feasibility shorten time case . The investigator previously observe vast majority ( &gt; 85 % ) elevation cardiac filling pressure reduction venous oxygen content people HFpEF occur low 20 Watt workload , repeat exercise hemodynamic assessment load sufficient detect clinically meaningful treatment effect .</detailed_description>
