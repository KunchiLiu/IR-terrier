	<detailed_description>The study design all-comer , prospective , multi-center , consecutive cohort series , open-label study . Detailed objective : To confirm clinical utility Advanixâ„¢ Pancreatic Stents use per standard practice facilitate pancreatic duct drainage follow clinical presentation : - Group A : PEP Risk - In subject deem high risk acute pancreatitis post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) - Group B : Impaired Pancreatic Duct Drainage - In subject pancreatic duct stricture and/or pancreatic duct stone and/or pancreatic duct sludge debris , possibly , exclusively ESWL pancreatic surgery - Group C : Pancreatic Duct Leak - In subject pancreatic duct leak - Group D : Post Pancreatic Surgery - In subject risk pancreatic duct leak strictures resection pancreatic lesion close main pancreatic duct level pancreatico-jejunostomy pancreatico-duodenectomy - Group E : Other - In subject indication</detailed_description>
