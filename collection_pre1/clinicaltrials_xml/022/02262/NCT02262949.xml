Subject agree comply protocolmandated followup procedure visit . 3 . The subject ≥ 21 year old . 4 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within seven day prior index procedure . Female subject surgically sterile postmenopausal exempt pregnancy test . 5 . The subject lifestylelimiting claudication mild tissue loss define : Rutherford Category1 25 ( moderate claudication minor tissue loss ) . 6 . The target lesion angiographic evidence stenosis restenosis ≥50 % occlusion SFA and/or popliteal artery ( visual estimate ) amenable PTA stenting . 7 . The target vessel reference diameter ( visual estimate ) appropriate treatment available stent diameter 6.0 7.0 mm . 8 . There angiographic evidence least one vessel runoff foot ( level malleolus ) . 1 . The subject unable unwilling provide inform consent unable unwilling comply study followup procedure visit . 2 . The subject claudication critical limb ischemia describe Rutherford Category 0 ( asymptomatic ) , 1 ( mild claudication ) , 6 ( major tissue loss ) . 3 .
