	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give hypofractionated boost primary tumor standard chemotherapy radiation therapy work treat patient stage II III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Advances radiation oncology allow good radiation target may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving precise target radiation standard chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell prevent cancer come back location start .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Boost Before Chemoradiation Patients With Stage II-III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Unsuitable Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate primary tumor control rate 12 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety tolerability regimen . II . To estimate rate regional , distant control well progression-free survival overall survival . III . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) regimen . IV . To evaluate response tumor stereotactic ( high-dose ) radiation use magnetic resonance tumor perfusion image modality ( magnetic resonance [ MR ] -dynamic contrast-enhanced [ DCE ] /perfusion weight image [ PWI ] , MR-diffusion , blood oxygenation level dependent [ BOLD ] sequence ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive hypofractionated boost primary tumor 2 fraction ( least 40 hour apart ) week 1 . Beginning week 2 , patient receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 8 , 15 , 36 , 43 ; etoposide IV 60 minute day 8-12 36-40 . If carboplatin paclitaxel administer concurrently radiotherapy , 2 cycle carboplatin ( AUC=6 mg/min/mL IV day 1 , 22 ) paclitaxel ( 200 mg/m2 IV day 1 , 22 ) consolidation chemotherapy require , administer start 4-6 week concurrent chemoradiation end . Each cycle 21 day long . If cisplatin etoposide administer concurrently radiotherapy , consolidation chemotherapy allow . Patients also undergo standard conformal radiation therapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week total 30 fraction . Treatment continue 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
