	<brief_summary>Background : - Staphylococcus aureus , staph , commonly find skin respiratory system . Sometimes people get sick staph infection get good standard treatment . These staph infection serious even deadly . Researchers want find people likely get infection . Objectives : - To look immune response skin expose bacteria . Eligibility : - People age 2 65 hyper IgE syndrome ( HIES ) recurrent staph infection . - Healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Over 1 5 day , participant may blood test skin nasal swab . They may additional test need . If recent biopsy , researcher may ask sample . - Some participant spend night clinic . Their vital sign take blood drawn . Some participant take aspirin ibuprofen start 2 day stay . - Some participant blister create inside forearm . Suction pull layer skin arm . Skin remove . Different solution apply blister . Up 3 biopsy may take . - Children blood test biopsy . - Participants call every day 10 day , 30 day procedure . - Participants follow-up visit 10 day procedure . - Participants get blister biopsy follow-up appointment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence community-associated ( CA ) staphylococcal infection , especially cause methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , increase dramatically recent year . Skin soft tissue primary site infection , skin mucosal colonization increase risk disseminate disease . Many patient without apparent underlie immune dysfunction suffer recurrent persistent skin infection MRSA . Additionally , patient condition atopic dermatitis Hyper IgE ( Job ) Syndrome ( HIES ) disproportionately affect . Although underlie host molecular defect responsible predispose condition uncover recent year ( e.g . STAT3 mutation HIES ) , skin immune response S. aureus infection elucidate either healthy control susceptible population . In protocol , perform exploratory evaluation anti-staphylococcal immune response healthy subject , subject STAT3 mutation , otherwise healthy subject history recurrent staphylococcal skin infection . An additional group subject underlying condition interest may include . The primary objective research perform vivo ex vivo challenge kill bacteria use skin blister model keratinocyte culture evaluate skin immune response . Occasionally , commensal fungi , Candida specie may also use . We use three experimental approach complete objective : 1 ) evaluation vivo response skin blister kill microbe exposure , 2 ) ex vivo evaluation anti-microbial response derivation keratinocyte culture skin blister biopsy , 3 ) evaluation function immune-stimulatory ability commensal organism . Specifically , suction blister device use induce skin blister forearm . The tops blister remove , solution kill S. aureus , commensal coagulase-negative staphylococcal specie , Gram-negative commensal well commensal fungi , Candida species apply blister stimulate inflammatory response . The blister fluid collect various time point 24 hour laboratory analysis . Baseline skin and/or nasal swab , skin biopsy , blood draw also perform ( The skin nasal swab may perform screen baseline visit. ) . Pediatric participant may enrol baseline skin and/or nasal swab . All research procedure perform National Institutes Health Clinical Center . We anticipate research provide critical new information human skin immune response S. aureus direct relevance development vaccine , diagnostics , therapeutic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants must either : 1 . Have documentation proven suspect immune defect history invasive infection recurrent ( 2 ) skin infection S. aureus ( patient population ) ; 2 . Not evidence immune defect history invasive recurrent S. aureus infection ( healthy volunteer ) . Participants must 2 65 year old ( inclusive ) . Participants must willing allow storage blood , DNA , RNA , bacterial fungal culture , tissue sample future research . Some research blood may require healthy volunteer , except discretion Principal Investigator ( PI ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow exclusion criterion apply participant : Current chemotherapy underlying malignancy . Current oral steroid . Individuals condition , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation study exclude . The following exclusion criterion apply adult participant : Viral hepatitis B C. Test result , include outside facility lab , within prior 6 month accept . HIV positive . Test result , include outside facility lab , within prior 6 month accept . Individuals anticoagulant antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin NSAIDs describe protocol ) . Pregnancy .</criteria>
