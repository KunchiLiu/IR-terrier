	<brief_title>Evaluate Interest Pre-conceptional Endometrial Immune Profiling Increase Birth Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Birth rate follow embryo transfer mean two embryo transfer stagnate around 23 % per transfer ( annual report Agency Biomedicine ) . Some estimate half infertile patient treat partially totally concerned problem inadequate uterine receptivity . The investigator ' hypothesis pre-conceptional immune endometrial evaluation may increase significantly birth rate since successful implantation result match competent embryo within competent endometrium . The identification endometrial biomarkers document immune uterine environment implantation window would able improve efficacy ART personalization treatment accordingly ability patient receive embryo . All patient inclusion criterion exclusion criterion include . Only patient deregulation ( immune analysis ) randomize .</detailed_description>
