	<brief_summary>2.1 Primary Study Hypothesis In sub-Saharan Africa , 2.5-17 % pregnant woman infect syphilis [ 1 ] . It estimate 53-82 % woman untreated syphilis adverse outcome compare 10-21 % uninfected woman [ 2 ] . The investigator others show syphilis screening integrate HIV antenatal clinic prevention mother child transmission ( PMTCT ) highly accepted excellent uptake . Unfortunately , minority male partner come test treatment ( 1 % -27 % ) important implication roll-out rapid syphilis test inability detect reinfection treponemal antibody test test remain positive despite treatment .
