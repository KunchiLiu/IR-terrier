A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator [ consultation Medical Monitor require ] agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Body weight &gt; = 60 kilogram body mass index within range 19 35 kilogram per square meter ( inclusive ) Female subject eligible participate nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : document tubal ligation , document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , document bilateral oophorectomy . Postmenopausal criterion define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level consistent menopause ( refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ) ] ; female hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) must discontinue HRT start study ; whose menopausal status doubt , require use one highly effective contraception method may need blood sample take check FSH/estradiol level . Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication two week last dose study medication ; vasectomy documentation azoospermia ; male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option : Contraceptive subdermal implant meet Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label , Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label , Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone , Injectable progestogen , Contraceptive vaginal ring ; percutaneous contraceptive patch .

QTcF &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) NOTE : The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) . The specific formula use determine eligibility discontinuation individual subject determine prior initiation study . In word , several different formula use calculate QTc individual subject low QTc value use include discontinue subject trial . For purpose data analysis , QTcF use specify Reporting Analysis Plan ( RAP ) . Permitted Medications NonDrug Therapies : Acetaminophen , dose = &lt; 2 grams/day permit use time study . Other concomitant medication may consider case case basis investigator consultation GSK Medical Monitor . All concomitant medication take study record case report form .
