	<brief_title>Observational Study Estimate Effectiveness Biologics When Treating Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plaque psoriasis chronic skin disease affect 1-3 % US European population severely impair quality life . Four biologics authorize Europe US treatment patient moderate severe psoriasis . Because complete skin clearance rare agent , treatment goal adopt regulatory reimbursement agency proportion patient achieve least 75 % reduction subject 's baseline PASI ( Psoriasis Area Severity Index ) score similarly , sPGA [ static Physician 's Global Assessment ) score 0 1 . Specifically , study provide information effectiveness approve biologics use clinical practice . This information currently consistently available source , include exist psoriasis patient registry . Study Hypothesis : This study estimate country proportion biologic treatment-naïve biologic treatment-switching psoriasis subject real-world total clearance 6 month initiate biologic . The study population include approximately 300 adult 6 participate country diagnose physician moderate severe plaque psoriasis , initiate biologic therapy ( biologic treatment-naïve biologic treatment-switching ) plaque psoriasis . Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : age 18 ; diagnose moderate severe plaque psoriasis ; initiate biologic approve psoriasis study entry ; able fill questionnaire ; provide write informed consent ; participate clinical trial utilize investigational agent 3 month prior first biologic dose . Assessments : Skin clearance primary indicator treatment effectiveness , measure use physician-reported PASI sPGA . Other assessment follow patient questionnaire : psoriasis symptom inventory ( PSI ) , dermatology life quality index ( DLQI ) , static patient 's global assessment ( sPtGA ) , treatment satisfaction global health status . All subject initiate biologic therapy study entry . Therapy discontinuation , switch , dose change follow-up report site summarize . Follow-up continue approximately 12 month first dose subject lose follow-up withdraws study ( reason include death ) , whichever come first . Where appropriate , data obtain subject mandatory visit 6 month ( ± 6 week ) 12 month ( ± 6 week ) first biologic dose , routine visit occur follow-up period . To extent possible data also collect usual care visit occur follow-up .</detailed_description>
