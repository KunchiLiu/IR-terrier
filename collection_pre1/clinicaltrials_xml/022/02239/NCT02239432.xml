	<brief_summary>Early adenocarcinoma lung excellent five-year survival resection . However , clinical radiologic presentation highly variable . Traditional mean preoperative diagnosis Positron Emission Tomography ( PET-CT ) trans-thoracic needle biopsy demonstrate unacceptable false positive negative rate . Telomere biology activate aberrantly lung cancer study early stage best knowledge . The objective study evaluate telomere length activity suspect early stage adenocarcinoma lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchoalveolar carcinoma traditionally use refer subset adenocarcinoma distinguish peripheral location , typical `` lepidic '' growth pattern tendency bronchogenic lymphatic spread . For purpose discussion consistency revise 2011 criterion , BAC subtypes collectively refer early adenocarcinoma . The clinical presentation early adenocarcinoma subtypes highly variable range small solitary nodule extensive lobar consolidation . Many peripheral lesion characteristic ground glass opacity appearance Chest CT , may correlate improved prognosis . The reported five-year disease-free survival resection isolate lesion may approach 100 % . Preoperative diagnosis lesion complicate several limitation . First , differential diagnosis broad include extensive number inflammatory infectious process . Second , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , identifies region increase metabolic activity , may falsely negative due slow growth early adenocarcinoma lesion . Transbronchial needle biopsy also unreliable confirm exclude disease non-solid type lesion . The proportion lung cancer classify adenocarcinoma steadily increase comprises nearly Â½ case . However , proportion adenocarcinoma situ uncertain . Previous report range 5-10 % large series high 24 % large Surveillance , Epidemiology End Results database . Thus , early adenocarcinoma lesion may represent disproportionately large number lung cancer PET negative yet carry excellent prognosis early resection . The early adenocarcinoma subtypes represent clinical entity require characterization distinguish lesion likely malignant benign . Telomerase activate aberrantly lung cancer mutation telomerase component predispose solid malignancy . For patient non-small cell lung cancer , numerous study correlate increase tumor telomerase activity increase likelihood Stage IIIB Stage IV disease and/or reduce survival . Furthermore , telomerase inhibition currently study clinical trial patient advance non-small lung cancer . Problem : The semi-solid lung lesion may represent early stage adenocarcinoma excellent prognosis upon early diagnosis prompt surgical resection . However , semi-solid lesion broad differential diagnosis preoperative feature characteristic adenocarcinoma need distinguish malignant benign lesion . Objective : To study telomere length telomerase activity patient suspect early adenocarcinoma lung refer surgical biopsy lung lesion .</detailed_description>
