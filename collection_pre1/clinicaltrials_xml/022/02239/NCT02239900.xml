	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Participants study enrol Phase 1 ( Dose De-Escalation , Dose-Finding ) Phase 2 ( Dose Expansion ) , base join study . Phase 1 : Dose De-Escalation : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 5 group base type disease . - If Groups 1 3 , receive SBRT 1 dose ipilimumab within day SBRT treatment , receive 3 dos ipilimumab . - If Groups 2 , 4 , 5 , receive 2 dos ipilimumab , SBRT , 2 dos ipilimumab . If Group 5 , SBRT give long period time ( day week ) . All participant receive dose level ipilimumab . You give separate consent form explain SBRT risk . In group , 3 participant enrol first dose level . If 1 participant intolerable side effect , 3 participant enrol dose level . If intolerable side effect see dose level , consider high tolerate dose . If enough intolerable side effect see assign dose level , total dose amount radiation give group may lower 2 time . Phase 2 : Dose Expansion : Once high tolerate dose combination find study group , 14 participant enrol dose level combination group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . If Groups 1 3 ( early ipilimumab SBRT ) , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 cycle . You also receive SBRT 30-45 minute Days 1-4 Cycle 1 . If Groups 2 4 ( late ipilimumab SBRT ) , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 Cycles 1 2 SBRT Days 29-33 . After SBRT treatment , take ipilimumab Day 1 Cycles 3 4 . If Group 5 ( late ipilimumab SBRT ) , receive ipilimumab Day 1 Cycle 1 SBRT 30-45 minute Days 1-5 Days 9-12 Cycle 1 . After SBRT treatment , take ipilimumab Day 1 Cycles 2-4 . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect help support immune system . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : During Week 1 cycle Week 2 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 3 Cycles 2 4 , MRI , CT scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If Phase 2 , Week 3 cycle , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw biomarker testing , doctor think safe . You may chest scan doctor think need . Length Study : You may receive 4 cycle treatment ipilimumab SBRT . About 8 week complete Cycle 4 , size tumor change get small receiving therapy , may able continue receive ipilimumab and/or radiation . The study doctor discus option . You longer able receive treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up : About 30 day last dose ipilimumab every 3 month 2 year , come clinic follow-up visit . At visit : - You physical exam , include measurement weight.. - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw biomarker testing , doctor think safe . - Urine collect routine test . - You MRI , CT scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . This investigational study . SBRT FDA approve control metastatic primary tumor . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic melanoma remove surgery . The use SBRT ipilimumab investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 120 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
