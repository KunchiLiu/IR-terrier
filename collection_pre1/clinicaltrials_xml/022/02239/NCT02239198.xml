	<brief_summary>There prevalent micronutrient fiber deficiency significant proportion US population , particularly among overweight obese . Intensive lifestyle counseling result modest , measurable dietary improvement weight stabilization , yet fall short restore optimal nutritional status metabolism . A carefully formulate nutritional supplement bar ( referred CHORIBAR ) deliver whole food matrix may correct micronutrient deficiency overweight obese adult child . This may beneficial impact traditional index insulin dysregulation metabolic syndrome , gut inflammation , redox status , immune function DNA integrity , may favorably influence weight change fat distribution . The investigator believe improvement see CHORIBAR trial mediate level generalize enhancement cellular metabolism readily achieve lifestyle counsel alone . The investigator suspect due many nutritional barrier , disproportionately borne inner city population , cost access healthy food . The investigator hypothesize nutritional supplement like CHORIBAR facilitate restoration optimal nutritional status improve metabolic weight outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Nutritional Supplement Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With USDA partner , develop whole-food , multi-component nutrient bar . Previous pilot study demonstrate short-term bar consumption result favorable increase HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-c ) , particularly large-HDL ( HDL-L ) lean overweight/obese individual . Obesity associate poor gastrointestinal health systemic inflammation , also associate low HDL . Our hypothesis carefully formulate nutritional supplement bar deliver whole food matrix correct micronutrient deficiency obese adult beneficial impact index insulin dysregulation metabolic syndrome . The aim project 1 ) characterize effect size index lipid profile , homocysteine , inflammation , insulin resistance , micronutrient level , DNA integrity , hunger satiety , BMI , waist circumference , blood pressure different formulation CHORI bar take twice daily period range 2-8 week . We also evaluate gut inflammation , redox status , tissue metal , DNA integrity novel exploratory assay may serve marker micronutrient malnutrition chronic disease risk . 2 ) Where significant improvement outcome variable observe , attempt `` deconstruct '' bar attempt determine active ingredient responsible change .</detailed_description>
