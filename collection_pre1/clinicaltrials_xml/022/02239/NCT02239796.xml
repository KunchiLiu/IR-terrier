	<brief_title>Feasibility Controlled Trial Tibial Nerve Stimulation Stroke Related Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke-related urinary incontinence ( UI ) persist one third stroke survivor . It associate significant burden include reduce quality life , increased morbidity disability . Urgency UI , together overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom ( frequency , urgency , nocturia ) , commonly experience . Current continence care limited lifestyle advice behavioural intervention void programmes . There reliance containment approach lack available option active treatment . Intermittent electrical stimulation posterior tibial nerve ( TPTNS ) effective treat non-stroke neurogenic UI OAB , test stroke population . This pilot randomise control trial ( RCT ) aim test potential effectiveness TPTNS stroke-related bladder dysfunction . Adults stroke-related UI randomise TPTNS sham . They and/or carer taught self-deliver programme TPTNS six week period . Bladder function , associate healthcare cost quality life outcome measure 6 , 12 26 week . A nested process evaluation conduct . Pilot RCT process evaluation result inform design phase III RCT TPTNS treat urinary incontinence stroke population .</detailed_description>
