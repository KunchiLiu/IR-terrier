	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) common co-morbidity patient CF . The underlie pathophysiology cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) still matter investigation . In addition localize tissue damage develop similar exocrine pancreas , mechanism may involve . We show potential contribute factor patho-physiology CFRD may abnormal gut derive hormonal profile , specifically low incretin hormone response , prior development CFRD . We propose altered incretin response , probably due impaired interaction nutrient gut mucosa due thicken secretion , may play role development disease . Specifically , low GIP GLP-1 , may explain poor β-cell function observe patient prior CFRD appearance . These incretins know trophic effect β-cells , thus low level may contribute development quantitative well qualitative defect β-cell function thus may lead development CFRD . Thus , increase level incretins use DPP-IV inhibitor may improve glucose metabolism delay/prevent development CFRD . We hypothesize Saxagliptin increase oDI compare placebo thus provide relative protection diabetes development addition expect Saxagliptin lead overall increase insulin concentration thus shift metabolic milieu anabolic state . This manifest weight gain reduction inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DPP-IV Inhibition Prior Development Diabetes Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following proposal include test utility DPP-IV inhibition adult patient CF without CFRD . This achieve randomized double blind control trial Saxagliptin 5 mg vs. placebo perform 3 month 60 patient CF without CFRD . The study 3 month use consist two arm : 1 . Saxagliptin 5mg 2 . Placebo . primary outcome study oral disposition index oDI , derive OGTT . The oDI show across age group metabolic phenotype excellent predictor diabetes development time . We postulate Saxagliptin increase incretin concentration thus improve insulin secretion . This manifest increased oral disposition index ( oDI ) , reflect improve beta cell response context prevail insulin sensitivity . The oDI useful predictor diabetes development time increase provide evidence protection diabetes special study population</detailed_description>
