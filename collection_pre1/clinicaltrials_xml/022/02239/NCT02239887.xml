	<brief_title>Coherex WAVECREST I Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Safety Endpoint The primary safety endpoint incidence major adverse event 45 day post-procedure . Major adverse event define life-threatening incident determine Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) include event device embolization ; cardiac injury , re-intervention , and/or device-related surgery ; bleed event pericardial effusion require drainage , cranial bleeding due source , gastrointestinal bleeding ; event related device procedure , require treatment . Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint incidence LAA occlusion 45 and/or 180 day ( +ten day ) post-procedure . LAA occlusion assess transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) color flow Doppler define absence flow LAA color flow Doppler jet less 3mm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Candidates study must meet ALL follow criterion 1 . At least 18 year age . 2 . Diagnosis paroxysmal , persistent , permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation . 3 . Indicated longterm anticoagulation therapy include patient anticoagulant patient contraindication anticoagulation . The first 30 patient must contraindication anticoagulation . 4 . Eligible cessation anticoagulation therapy LAA seal ( i.e. , patient condition require anticoagulation therapy ) . 5 . Calculated CHADS score ≥ 1 . 6 . Willingness participate require followup visit test . 7 . Willingness patient legal representative provide write informed consent . 8 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior index procedure , must willing use reliable contraception method one year postprocedure . 1 . Known contraindication and/or allergy aspirin , clopidogrel , IV contrast , nickel . 2 . Extensive congenital cardiac anomaly , adequately repair cardiac surgery . 3 . Stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , diagnosed neurologist , within past 30 day . Patients history stroke TIA allow enroll 30 day post stroke TIA complete . 4 . New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure , define patient severe physical limitation symptom even rest . 5 . Myocardial infarction within past three month . 6 . Sepsis within one month prior implantation systemic infection successfully treat prior device placement . 7 . Presence atrial septal defect , atrial septal repair , atrial septal closure device . 8 . Female subject may pregnant plan become pregnant next year . 9 . Cardioversion ablation procedure plan conjunction within 30 day placement Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System . 10 . Cardiac transplant mechanical valve . 11 . Symptomatic carotid artery disease . 12 . Any medical disorder psychiatric illness would interfere successful completion study determine investigator . 13 . Conditions atrial fibrillation require longterm warfarin therapy . 14 . Resting heart rate &gt; 110 beat per minute ( bpm ) . 15 . A single episode transient atrial fibrillation . 16 . Thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 50,000 platelets/mm3 ) , thrombocythemia ( &gt; 700,000 platelets/mm³ ) , leucopenia ( white blood cell count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³ ) , anemia ( hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10 gram per deciliter [ g/dl ] ) . 17 . Currently participate investigational drug another device trial complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current trial endpoint . ( Trials require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial . ) 18 . Any condition would reduce life expectancy less two year date index procedure . Echocardiographic criterion exclusion : 1 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 30 % . 2 . Mitral valve stenosis &lt; 1.5 cm2 stenosis consistent rheumatic valvular disease . 3 . Pericardial effusion &gt; 5 mm preprocedure . 4 . Evidence intracardiac thrombus visualize TEE . 5 . Presence patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) demonstrate large shunt and/or atrial septal aneurysm &gt; 10 mm excursion . 6 . Cardiac tumor .</criteria>
