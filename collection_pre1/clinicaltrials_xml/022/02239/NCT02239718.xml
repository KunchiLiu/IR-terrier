	<brief_summary>Tooth replacement significant issue World dental implant conventional bridge use replace miss teeth , dental implant expensive many conventional dental bridge destructive support tooth tissue . Resin-bonded bridge ( RBBs ) conservative cost effective replacement option involve minimal tooth preparation , leave majority tooth intact . They secure place adhesive cement , bond outer enamel layer . Clinical audit prosthesis University Hong Kong show two-unit RBBs high success rate dental literature replacement miss premolar incisor teeth . However , replacement molar teeth , two-unit RBBs perform , establish protocol recognise text contraindicate use due concern tip drift support teeth . Replacement single miss molar tooth three-unit , fixed-fixed ( single-piece casting ) three-unit , fixed-movable ( two-part casting ) . However , fixed-fixed option high debond failure rate two-unit RBBs therefore , centre , modify , 3-unit fixed-movable design use . This two-part casting allows minor , independent movement support teeth thereby aim reduce stress , similarly , reduce de-bonding force . This potential great longevity easy long-term maintenance major part bridge debonds recemented . The aim unique study compare 2-unit 3-unit RBBs replacement single miss molar tooth randomize clinical trial . These two design clinically evaluate 6 month , 1 year , 2 year 3 year observe outcome measure . The primary outcome examine success dental prosthesis respect need clinical intervention repair remediate RBB support tooth . Minor outcome measure examine fatigue damage prosthesis , change bone support , pulpal periodontal health tooth mobility . Patient satisfaction quality life evaluation dental prosthesis also examine . Will 2-unit RBBs offer patient simpler , cheap , successful option current design ? This previously report .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . A miss molar tooth range length 810 mm judge pretreatment study model . ( No one per quadrant , one , different design use mouth . ) 2 . The patient inform various treatment option ( dental implant , partial denture , conventional fixed prosthodontics treatment ) patient choose RBB preferred treatment option , invite participate study 3 . The patient available attend clinical examination 6 monthly interview period 36 month start study 4 . The patient minimum 12 occlude pair teeth ( 24 teeth total ) 5. natural dentition oppose plan RBB 6 . More 30 % bone support tooth abutment ( ) 7 . Patients agree randomly assign one two treatment group , 2unit bridge 3unit fix movable bridge 8 . The patient inform nature study require sign consent form agree undertake treatment study 9 . The patient 18 year old 10 . The patient sound dental health , ie active caries control periodontal disease 1 . Patients active tooth decay 2 . Patients uncontrolled periodontal disease . RBB abutment probe depth great 5mm bleed probe 3 . Patients teeth miss opposite plan RBB 4 . Abutment tooth mobility 2 great ( Millers classification ) 5 . Patients know allergy dental alloy use make RBB , ie . Ni/Cr 6 . Patients debilitate illness complicate medical condition 7 . Nonvital root treat abutment teeth</criteria>
