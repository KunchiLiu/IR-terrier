	<brief_summary>The purpose study find pathological complete response ( pCR ) chemotherapy give surgery ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) could predict evaluation RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) disruption pattern ( RNA Disruption Assay RDA score ) obtain biopsy tumor 7 - 14 day first , second third cycle chemotherapy treatment . If determine optimal time neoadjuvant chemotherapy measure RDA score prediction pCR , optimize breast cancer management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy , current practice monitoring response treatment measure size breast tumor cycle chemotherapy . The drawback method , take several week actually measure significant change size ; initial response chemotherapy often evident soften tumor without apparent decrease tumor size . Finding reliable way identify early response chemotherapy would helpful enable match chemotherapy individual 's need . In previous trial breast cancer treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy , researcher identify pCR full treatment chemotherapy could predict change RNA pattern obtain biopsy tumor half way chemotherapy course . [ Parissenti et al . 2010 ] The purpose study determine predict pCR neoadjuvant chemotherapy examine pattern RNA disruption ( RNA Disruption Assay RDA score ) breast biopsy tissue obtain 7 14 day first , second third cycle chemotherapy . If determine optimal time neoadjuvant chemotherapy measure RDA score prediction pCR , optimize breast cancer management . For example , RDA score identify non-responders earlier , switch chemotherapy agent reduce exposure unnecessary side-effects ineffective treatment .</detailed_description>
