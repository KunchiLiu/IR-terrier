	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see whether wear weighted vest period active weight loss decrease loss muscle bone occur weight loss . We also determine study participant wear weighted vest great improvement physical function self-reported disability , pain , stiffness , fatigue quality life . This knowledge could impact weight loss program design old adult . Hypothesis : Participants randomize VEST experience similar weight loss , less loss lean mass bone density , participant randomize Control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The loss muscle mass bone density weight loss partially attribute decrease mechanical stress tissue weight reduce . As result , perform exercise enhance muscle gravitational loading period caloric restriction usually diminish relative amount muscle bone loss give weight loss , intervention fully prevent muscle bone loss.In addition , conventional exercise training intervention often require expensive equipment , on-site participation , , ideally old , obese adult , safety supervision train exercise leader . Moreover , exercise perform may fully translate improvement daily task due train specificity , always tolerate sustain , especially obese person OA . On hand , conceivable treat decrease mechanical load weight loss externally replace lose weight via use weight vest may also effective reduce muscle bone loss caloric restriction . In animal model , mechanism regulate skeletal tissue structure function respond similar fashion increase actual externally-added body mass . Also , research show exercise wear weighted vest improve bone density , muscle mass , low extremity strength old adult . However , prior study examine effect weight vest use muscle mass bone density period intentional weight loss . The main objective pilot study assess feasibility ( accrual , retention , compliance ) daily use weighted vest diet intervention , estimate variability outcome measure , obtain preliminary estimate treatment efficacy . A controlled , randomized design use obtain realistic estimate accrual unbiased estimate treatment efficacy . A total 36 old ( age=65-79 yr ) , obese ( BMI=30-40 kg/m2 ) , sedentary men woman x-ray evidence knee OA undergo 22 week weight loss intervention ( target 10 % weight loss ) randomization one two group ( n=18/grp ) : 1 ) No vest use ( Control ) ; 2 ) Progressive weight vest use normal daily activity ( VEST ) .</detailed_description>
