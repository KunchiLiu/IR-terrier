	<brief_summary>This phase II study determine safety preliminary efficacy human monoclonal antibody ( BTT1023 ) target vascular adhesion protein ( VAP-1 ) use treatment patient primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial BTT1023 Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis progressive immune mediate biliary disease characterise bile duct inflammation fibrosis , accompany hepatic fibrosis . For patient elevated alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) particular , progressive disease predict , currently result need liver transplantation majority . No current medical therapy yet show effective alter natural history disease . For reason patient PSC elevate ALP value recruit study , evaluate impact Vap-1 blockade BTT1023 , early phase study focus biochemical efficacy safety . This early phase study BTT1023 immune mediate liver disease , rationale identify biochemical efficacy effect ( reduction ALP ) safety , orphan disease indication PSC presently lack medical therapy . The study design therefore focus identify early biochemical efficacy signal justify large scale , randomise control study longer duration .</detailed_description>
