	<brief_summary>The investigator assume transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation ( TEAS ) pretreatment may activate endogenous protective mechanism , result protect patient subsequent surgical stress pregnancy . And TEAS may induce production endogenous analgesic transmitter , develop anesthetic-sparing effect . The investigator believe intervention reduce subsequent incidence , duration severity organ dysfunction , possibly reduce morbidity , even mortality . So study , investigator hypothesize TEAS anesthesia surgery would decrease morbidity mortality postoperative complication 30 day digestive surgery elderly patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients older 65 year old high risk postoperative morbidity mortality . With increase number old patient schedule digestive surgery , explore method decrease postoperative morbidity important . Noninvasive method may easier clinically use . Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation ( TEAS ) prove decrease need general anesthetic anesthesia , alleviate systemic inflammatory response . Considering morbidity mortality surgery closely relate use anesthetic inflammatory response , TEAS may good selection improve postoperative outcomes.Among postoperative complication , pulmonary complication systemic inflammatory response syndrome high incidence , focus two complication study .</detailed_description>
