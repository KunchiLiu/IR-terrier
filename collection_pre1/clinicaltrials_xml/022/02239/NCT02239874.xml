	<brief_summary>The VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL ( VITAL ; NCT 01169259 ) ongoing randomize clinical trial 25,875 U.S. men woman investigate whether take daily dietary supplement vitamin D3 ( 2000 IU ) omega-3 fatty acid ( OmacorÂ® fish oil , 1 gram ) reduce risk develop cancer , heart disease , stroke people prior history illness . This ancillary study conduct among participant VITAL examine whether vitamin D effect mammographic breast density , mammographic texture feature , gene expression profile breast biopsy tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL : Effects Mammographic Density Breast Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mammographic density one strongest risk factor breast cancer . It predictive breast cancer risk least 10 year futue suggest surrogate marker breast cancer risk . Several state mandate release mammographic density data woman . However , except anti-hormonal therapy ( e.g. , tamoxifen ) , intervention prove reduce breast density . Thus , test promising , well-tolerated intervention might affect mammographic density substantial interest . Several line evidence suggest vitamin D may play role breast density breast carcinogenesis . Vitamin D reduce proliferation promotes differentiation apoptosis breast cell culture . However , large-scale randomized study examine impact vitamin D mammographic density . We propose examine randomize effect vitamin D3 mammographic breast density NIH sponsor VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL ( VITAL ) , ongoing randomize , double blind , trial test vitamin D3 ( 2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol ) omega-3 fatty acid ( 840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [ EPA ] + docosahexaenoic acid [ DHA ] ) primary prevention cancer cardiovascular disease multi-ethnic population 24,000 men woman . In ancillary sub study , mammogram obtain 4000 woman age 55-67 year ( 25 % African-American ) , baseline ( pre-randomization ) 1 4 year randomize therapy . Centrally process quantitative mammographic density texture variation measure . We determine randomize vitamin D treatment associate change mammographic feature , whether effect modify baseline mammographic density , baseline 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level . In addition , tissue sample woman VITAL undergo breast biopsy/surgery , nonmalignant malignant condition , collect . Quantitative morphological measure , well gene expression assay target vitamin D activation breast carcinogenesis pathway , perform collect tissue among woman randomize vitamin D3 compare placebo . This ancillary study provide timely opportunity test comprehensively effect vitamin D3 mammographic feature breast tissue biology randomize set minimal additional cost .</detailed_description>
