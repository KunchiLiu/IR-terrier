	<brief_title>Screening Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Kidney Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease cause kidney damage get bad increase age , lead chronic kidney disease kidney failure nearly one third patient sickle cell disease . Some patient develop kidney damage young age others show mild kidney damage old age . We know natural progression kidney damage sickle cell disease patient , know prone develop severe kidney damage . Therefore , currently , preventative measure treatment sickle cell relate kidney disease . The purpose research study collect data help assess progression kidney damage sickle cell disease , develop novel urine blood test predict kidney damage early , develop treatment idea intervention prevention kidney damage eventually lead kidney failure .</detailed_description>
