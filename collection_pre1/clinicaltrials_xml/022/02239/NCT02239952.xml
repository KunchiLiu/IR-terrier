	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine intratumoral concentration kinase inhibitor upon 2 week treatment tumor tissue ( brain ) patient high-grade glioma ( HGG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HGG-TCP ( High Grade Glioma - Tumor Concentrations Protein Kinase Inhibitors )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical trial HGG , multiple agent target various oncogenic signaling pathway play important role biology HGG study , unfortunately small number patient seem benefit treatment strategy . Whether disappointing result due restrict drug delivery blood-brain barrier , due differential biological characteristic HGGs , remain unknown . To good understand clinical observation find potential insight overcome , intend measure tumor concentration PKIs approximately two week treatment determine whether tumor concentration correlate plasma- CSF concentration PKIs . Subsequently , intend determine ( phospho ) proteomic profile kinase inhibitory activity tumor tissue HGG patient approximately two week treatment PKI .</detailed_description>
