	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Biological Activity ATYR1940 Adult Patients With Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ATYR1940-C-002 multi-national , multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , ascend dose study design evaluate safety , tolerability , PK , immunogenicity , pharmacodynamic effect ATYR1940 patient FSHD . Up 44 patient plan enrolled multiple study center U.S. Europe ; actual number patient enrol depend number cohort initiate . Patients screen study eligibility Screening period within 3 week Baseline ( i.e. , Day 1 , first day Study Drug administration ) . Eligible patient , base Screening assessment , randomly assign treatment ATYR1940 placebo . Patients randomize consider enrolled study . After enrollment , patient enter 1-week single-blind placebo period patient receive single 30-minute IV infusion placebo . Thereafter , patient enter double-blind treatment period receive 30-minute IV infusion Study Drug ( ATYR1940 placebo ) accord random treatment assignment .</detailed_description>

Patient provide write informed consent nature study explain prior performance researchrelated procedure . Patient , Investigator 's opinion , willing able comply study procedure . Cohorts ≥2 : Patient image finding meeting define criterion muscle inflammation least 1 skeletal muscle Patient currently receive treatment immunomodulatory agent history treatment , include target biological therapy ( e.g. , etanercept , omalizumab ) within 3 month Baseline ; corticosteroid within 4 week Baseline ; highdose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) within 2 week Baseline . Patient currently receive curcumin albuterol require treatment study participation . Patient evidence alternative diagnosis FSHD , base prior muscle biopsy genetic test finding . Patient presumptive diagnosis FSHD , base clinical assessment , yet genetic confirmation diagnosis . Patient severe retinopathy . Patient history obstructive restrictive lung disease ( include interstitial lung disease , pulmonary fibrosis , asthma ) , evidence interstitial lung disease Screening chest radiograph . Patient history antisynthetase syndrome , prior Jo1 antibody ( Ab ) positivity , positive equivocally positive Jo1 Ab test result Screening . Patient acute clinically relevant EpsteinBarr virus cytomegalovirus infection reactivation . Patient chronic infection hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus , human immunodeficiency virus history tuberculosis . Patient receive vaccination within 8 week Baseline vaccination plan study participation . Patient symptomatic cardiomyopathy severe cardiac arrhythmia may , Investigator 's opinion , limit patient 's ability complete study protocol . Patient anemia ( defined patient 's age gender local laboratory range ) . Patient gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) serum creatinine level &gt; 2 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Patient abnormal baseline finding , medical condition ( ) , laboratory finding , Investigator 's opinion , might jeopardize patient 's safety decrease chance obtain satisfactory data need achieve objective study . Patient evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , hematological , metabolic , dermatological , gastrointestinal disease , condition require immediate surgical intervention treatment may allow safe participation . Patient use investigational product device ( mobility assistance device ) within 30 day Baseline . Patient receive product intend enhance muscle growth within 30 day Baseline . Patient underwent muscle biopsy within 30 day Baseline . Patient initiate treatment statin significant adjustment statin regimen within 3 month Baseline . ( Stable , chronic statin use permissible . ) Patient receive product putatively enhance muscle growth ( e.g. , insulinlike growth factor , growth hormone ) activity ( e.g. , Coenzyme A ) chronic basis within 4 week Baseline . Patient unwilling abstain strenuous physical activity 24 hour prior study center visit . Patient previously receive ATYR1940 . If female childbearing potential ( premenopausal surgically sterile ) , patient positive pregnancy test Screening unwilling use contraception time Screening 1 month last Study Drug dose . Acceptable method birth control include abstinence , barrier method , hormone , intrauterine device . If male , patient unwilling use condom plus spermicide sexual intercourse time Screening 1 month last Study Drug dose . Cohorts ≥2 : Patient know contraindication MRI assessment ( e.g. , metal prosthesis pacemaker ) per local site MRI protocol</criteria>
