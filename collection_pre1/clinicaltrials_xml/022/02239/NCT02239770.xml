	<brief_summary>The objective study test effect range dose novel nicotine film plasma nicotine level , expire carbon monoxide , via questionnaire , subjective rating film side effect . The nicotine film part standard care available non-investigational setting . The investigator hypothesize plasma nicotine level keep induced oral nicotine replacement therapy ( NRTs ) smoking cigarette . Thus , investigator predict random delivery nicotine via oral film safe well-tolerated human subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Nicotine Film Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Briefly , two-part pharmacokinetic study , part involve 12 participant . In Part 1 , 4 volunteer smoker ( male , female ) abstain tobacco/nicotine product 16 hour attend Penn State Clinical Research Center measurement blood nicotine pharmacokinetic response randomly allocate dose either ( ) 0mg , ( b ) 2mg ( c ) 4mg oral nicotine film . A trained nurse implant intravenous indwell catheter participant , provide baseline blood sample 16 hour abstinence , confirm exhaled carbon-monoxide &lt; 6 ppm , place nicotine film mouth blood drawn every 10 minute next 60 minute , every 30 minute next 2 hour plus one blood draw one minute film dissolve ( 11 blood draw 3 hour use nicotine film ) . Subjective measure ( ) nicotine withdrawal craving ( b ) potential nicotine effect , include symptom nicotine intoxication , record every 30 minute , blood pressure heart rate . The investigator expect find peak blood nicotine concentration around 3-4 ng/ml 5-6 ng/ml two active dos nicotine film , peak occur approximately 30 minute film administration , level drop least half 2 hour later . These peak blood nicotine level within range smoker might obtain smoke single cigarette . Upon completion blood draw , train nurse remove catheter treat puncture wound . The participant receive $ 60 visit . In Part 2 , 12 participant attend Penn State Clinical Research Center 16 hour abstinence , confirm exhaled Carbon-monoxide &lt; 6 ppm . On visit participant consume repeat dos nicotine film intend mimic pattern delivery use smoking cessation study 2 fMRI study 3 . The primary issue determine peak blood nicotine concentration safety result ( ) high dose schedule could use study 2 3 , ( b ) steady state level produce repeat administration 2mg nicotine film , ( c ) compare subjective effect placebo . In order mimic aggressive dosing schedule possible `` random nicotine '' arm study 2 3 , investigator assess blood nicotine , subjective basic cardiovascular response consume nicotine film every 3 hour begin 8:00 a.m. follow schedule : 4mg , 4mg , 0mg , 4mg . All 12 participant attend 16 hour nicotine abstinence . 4 subject randomly allocate consume 4 film 12 hour follow order ( ) 0,0,0,0 mg ( b ) 2,2,2,2 ( c ) 4,4,0,4 . A blood sample drawn baseline prior film administration , 30 , 60 120 minute film administration well one minute film dissolution ( 20 blood draw total ) , heart rate BP assess every 30 minute . Nicotine half-life approximately 2 hour , investigator expect 3-hourly administration much build-up nicotine level level low end typical level experience smoker every day . At clinic visit , addition provide blood sample measurement plasma nicotine concentration , participant ask complete battery survey instrument assess subjective effect ( e.g . withdrawal crave ) physical symptom ( e.g . dizziness nausea ) could cause either nicotine withdrawal nicotine exposure .</detailed_description>
