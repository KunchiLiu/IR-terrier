	<detailed_description>Excessive bleeding cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) operation remain persistent problem . Antiplatelet therapy ( APT ) integral component perioperative management patient undergo cardiac surgery . The impact drug induce platelet inhibition early postoperative bleeding extent transfusion requirement remain difficult predict . In addition , resistance antiplatelet drug well perioperative increase platelet reactivity follow CPB report phenomenon comprehensively investigate . The best point-of-care platelet function test predict bleed complications/transfusion requirement remain unclear . In addition , best test platelet function test monitor resistance antiplatelet therapy impact clinical outcome remain elusive . The aim study : 1. compare two point-of-care platelet function analyzer ( Multiplate ROTEM Platelet ) regard prediction bleed complications/trasfusion requirement . Three different test perform device simultaneously three time point : T1 ) Preoperative test include ASPI test , ADP test TRAP test Multiplate device ARATEM , ADPTEM TRAPTEM ROTEM Platelet device , respectively . T2 ) After declamping aorta : ASPI test , ADP test TRAP test Multiplate device ARATEM , ADPTEM TRAPTEM ROTEM Platelet device perform . T3 ) 5-10 minute protamine administration : ASPI test , ADP test TRAP test Multiplate device ARATEM , ADPTEM TRAPTEM ROTEM Platelet device perform . Results obtain two platelet function point-of-care device first three timepoints test correlation postoperative bleed amount intra/postoperative transfusion requirement . Predictibalility bleed complication well transfusion requirement compare Multiplate test ROTEM Platelet test . 2. compare two point-of-care platelet function analyzer ( Multiplate ROTEM Platelet ) regard detection high `` on-treatment '' platelet reactivity pre- postoperatively . To compare Multiplate ROTEM Platelet assessment high treatment platelet reactivity use test perform preoperatively ( T1 ) test performed fourth postoperative day ( T4 ) . ASPI test ( Multiplate ) ARATEM test ( ROTEM Platelet ) sensitive platelet inhibitory effect acetylsalicylic acid . Thus , incidence resistance acetylsalicylic acid , measure Multiplate ASPI test ROTEM Platelet ARATEM compare device measurement perform T1 T4 , respectively . Specific subanalysis perform ARATEM test aim make laboratory base definition resistance acetylsalicylic acid . Specific cut-of value acetylsalicylic acid resistance already define work group Multiplate ASPI test . ADP test ( Multiplate ) ADPTEM test ( ROTEM Platelet ) sensitive effect thienopyridines . For patient preoperatively expose thienopyridines , measurement Multiplate ADP test ROTEM Platelet ADPTEM test perform T1 aim compare incidence high on-treatment platelet reactivity . Preoperative ( T1 ) postoperative ( T4 ) measurement obtain Multiplate ROTEM Platelet compare . Perioperative increase platelet reactivity evaluate .</detailed_description>
