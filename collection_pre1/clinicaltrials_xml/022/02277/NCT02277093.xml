	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm refractory colorectal cancer Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm CT scan , &gt; 20 mm chest xray , &gt; 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Refractory intolerant standard systemic therapy , include receive two standard available therapy know prolong survival s/he eligible , include FOLFOX FOLFIRI without bevacizumab , aflibercept , cetuximab , panitumumab At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 50,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Prior therapy JAK2 FLT3 inhibitor . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Received chemotherapeutic target agent metastatic colorectal cancer within two week initiation study drug . Currently receive investigational agent . Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pacritinib agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patient must negative pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction pacritinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Use potent cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitor within one week pacritinib initiation . Patients CTCAE grade 2 cardiac arrhythmia may consider inclusion arrhythmia stable , asymptomatic , unlikely affect patient safety . Patients exclude ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias CTCAE grade ≥ 3 , correct QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation &gt; 450ms , factor increase risk QT interval prolongation ( eg , heart failure , hypokalemia [ define serum potassium &lt; 3.0mEq/L persistent refractory correction ] , family history long QT interval syndrome ) . Any gastrointestinal ( GI ) metabolic condition could interfere absorption oral medication ongoing grade 3 high diarrhea , constipation , nausea , vomit . Active viral hepatitis .</criteria>
