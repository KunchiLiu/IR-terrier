	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well voxel base diffusion tensor image predict response patient brain metastasis undergo whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery . Voxel base diffusion tensor imaging ( VB-DTI ) may allow doctor measure response whole brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery earlier possible standard magnetic resonance imaging . The early ability measure response may allow consideration alternative therapy earlier stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Voxel Based Diffusion Tensor Imaging Predicting Response Patients With Brain Metastases Undergoing Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Stereotactic Radiosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine voxel base diffusion tensor image provide early predictive assessment therapy response , compare radiographic volumetric response criterion . OUTLINE : Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) total 10 fraction also undergo VB-DTI magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) baseline , 1 week WBRT initiation , 7-11 day completion WBRT . Patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) without WBRT also undergo VB-DTI MRI baseline 7-11 day completion SRS . After completion study , patient follow every 2 month 6 month every 6 month death .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients multiple lesion solid tumor clinical MRI diagnose brain metastasis may treat either WBRT SRS clinically indicate time presentation Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) &gt; = 70 Patients present brain metastasis newly diagnose cancer may systemic disease ( brain disease time initial cancer diagnosis ) Patients history cancer , newly diagnose brain metastasis must clinically stable systemic disease If biopsy perform , patient least 1 week postbiopsy The patient must able commit diffusionweighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , chemical shift imaging ( CSI ) prior treatment , first week treatment , 711 day completion treatment Magnetic Resonance Research Center ( MRRC ) Patients undergo SRS without WBRT must able commit diffusionweighted MR imaging , DTI , CSI prior treatment , 711 day completion SRS treatment MRRC The patient must also able commit posttreatment followup visit Montefiore Medical Center involve serial MR imaging ; followup visit occur bimonthly 6 month every 6 month death Any medical condition , would make imaging study WBRT unsafe poorly tolerate Patient receive concurrent chemotherapy Known allergic reaction contrast shellfish Patients brain metastasis treat radiosurgery Patients brain metastasis result hematologic malignancy small cell lung cancer Implanted metal device foreign body serve contraindication MR image Creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dl creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mg/dl Uncontrolled , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Severe claustrophobia Pregnant female Any prior radiation therapy brain KPS &lt; 70 Patients leptomeningeal disease</criteria>
