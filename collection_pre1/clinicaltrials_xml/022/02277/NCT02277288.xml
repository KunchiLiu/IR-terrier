	<brief_title>Does Bladder Instillation Reduce Time Discharge After Sling Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary stress incontinence affect 4-35 % woman . Due large economic impact prevalence disease , urinary incontinence significant public health issue . With rise healthcare cost become increasingly important manage patient care cost-efficient manner . Considering increase number woman undergo mid-urethral sling procedure , imperative perioperative care streamline order minimize cost . The Cedars-Sinai Center Continence Women 's Pelvic Health institute new practice pattern enable patient complete void trial sooner surgery compare previous practice pattern thus allow patient discharge earlier ultimately decrease cost . The purpose study compare previous void trial practice ( empty bladder end surgery ) versus newly institute practice ( fill bladder 250cc ) perform cost benefit analysis determine significant decrease recovery discharge time . Both practice fall standard-of-care . However , several standard-of-care procedure , none test superiority . To date randomize control trial address issue female mid-urethral sling surgery . Boccola et al show study 60 men undergone transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) instill bladder 300-500cc warm saline time void significantly decrease compare standard indwell catheter removal . It also show bladder instillation group significantly short time discharge . The study suggest give significant decrease time recovery , would ideal practice many outpatient procedure . Willson , et al , another randomize trial 75 men underwent TURP , find bladder infusion allow early decision-making discharge second postoperative day . Finally , McAchran Goldman find patient manage use fast-track regimen outpatient set mid-urethral sling procedure median time recovery area discharge le 3 hour . For study , significant decrease time discharge newly institute practice pattern demonstrate , practice adopt institution become new standard care help decrease cost patient time hospital .</detailed_description>
