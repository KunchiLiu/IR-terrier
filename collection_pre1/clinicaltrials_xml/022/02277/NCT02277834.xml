	<brief_title>Characterizing Pancreatic Cancer Proteome From Pancreatic Juice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer difficult detect treat , patient cancer generally live few year patient type cancer . Part reason pancreatic cancer hard treat usually discover advanced able treat . The goal protocol find way detect pancreatic cancer earlier , still treatable order improve survival patient . The pancreas gland produce digestive juice mix food intestine . Normal patient well patient pancreatic cancer produce juice . Other researcher collect fluid small number patient result suggest pancreatic fluid use detect pancreatic cancer . One major issue result pancreatic fluid number patient collect analyzed . In order find whether pancreatic fluid use standard test pancreatic cancer , fluid great number patient need analyzed . Also , different chemical pancreatic fluid , study try figure important chemical diagnose pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
