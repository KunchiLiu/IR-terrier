	<brief_summary>The project , conduct step wedge cluster randomize trial , design evaluate participatory implementation model NYC HealthCorps ( HC ) high school assess outcomes within across school setting . The behavioral objective 2010 Dietary Guidelines address obesity youth include : 1 ) decrease sugary beverage intake ; 2 ) increase frequency breakfast ; 3 ) increase vegetable fruit intake 2Â½ cup per day ; 4 ) decreasing frequency fast food meal ; 5 ) become physically active ( goal 1 hour per day ) ; 6 ) reduce sedentary behavior time ( &lt; 2 hour day ) . The study employ system dynamic model ( SDM ) ass wellness programming option evaluate program implementation within context diverse school ecology . The RE-AIM evaluation metric ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) use guide SDM development validation . The Specific Aims : 1 . To refine participatory school wellness program model toolkits . The study team add simulation exercise engage stakeholder refine toolkit strategy address institutional/community level program implementation barrier individual level barrier achieve healthy lifestyle recommendation . 2 . To assess impact participatory implementation program participate school . Primary hypothesis : Students achieve key health behavior New York City ( NYC ) HealthCorps school randomize participatory implementation compare student wait-listed HealthCorps control school ; Secondary hypothesis : Improvements key behavior great student whose BMI z-scores decrease compare whose BMI z-scores decrease . 3 . To evaluate implementation system dynamic model facilitate dissemination . The simulation analysis apply RE-AIM framework address : Reach ( participation rate ) , effectiveness ( outcome ) , adoption ( acceptability ) , implementation ( intervention fidelity ) , maintenance ( sustainability lifestyle change student program school ) , order facilitate refining toolkits train program dissemination school set diverse educational venue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wellness Program Implementation : School &amp; Student Toolkits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project focus enhance implementation school wellness activity goal achieve federal lifestyle recommendation reduce obesity . The study evaluate whether use toolkit approach problem-solving strategy help school student develop healthy lifestyle choice . At school level , focus implementation barrier identify ( bring ) school Wellness Councils ( e.g. , crowd gym , lack equipment , food service issue ) use toolkit approach build Alliance Healthier Generation school toolkits . At student level , toolkit focus FitnessGram feedback self-assessment strategy personalize behavioral goal set address obesity relate lifestyle recommendation physical education ( PE ) programming . A stepped-wedge trial design use achieve sequential roll NYC HealthCorps affiliate school time . This design allow random selection school receive enhanced support use participation research principles determine address obesity-related school mandate . Consistent participatory research principle , HealthCorps coordinator receive train function Wellness Council facilitator . This study evaluate participatory implementation model design extend wellness stakeholder collaboration towards achieve policy standard goal focus specific FitnessGram testing , food service , PE curriculum . By end study , HealthCorps school participatory implementation wellness program order randomly determine . A subset four NYC HealthCorps-affiliated school randomly select year receive participatory implementation support , school yet randomize serve control school . The structure trial involve comparison school participatory implementation wellness program delay implementation . This implementation approach increase potential learning lesson generalize widely pragmatic trial . In keep participatory research principle , school Wellness Councils use data obtain trial feedback potential refinement toolkit component . The research team work school Wellness Councils key stakeholder develop additional school toolkit item utilizing problem-solving strategy low-cost method address implementation barrier . The element participatory action research focus form school Wellness Council partnership build trust , share vision , mutual capacity , include engagement multiple level well active participation stakeholder create salient effective program . The HealthCorps coordinator guide stakeholder via Wellness Council specific program area engage 6-step iterative process list : 1 . Examine local indicator data e.g. , FitnessGram , Health Behavior Survey Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( YBRFSS ) item , food service data , school environment/climate data , community data 2 . Consider current programs/curricula alternative relate behavioral indicator ( use social ecological framework ) student , family , school , community consideration medium spheres influence , 3 . Develop program/curriculum S.M.A.R.T . ( specific , measurable , attainable , realistic time limit ( consider semester/school year ) ) goal focus Dietary Guidelines FitnessGram indicator 4 . Identify barrier develop strategy school student toolkit 5 . Implement school program element ongoing monitoring stakeholder Wellness Council 6 . Use iterative process adapt new need sustain program Basic simulation model , Grab-and-Go Breakfast model use demonstrate potential effect implement give toolkit option . The school student toolkits develop formative evaluation serve template use intervention school . The initial training guide/toolkit format base used Alliance Healthier Generation school wellness programming . Initial feedback HealthCorps coordinator indicate Alliance Wellness Council guide/toolkit readily implement HealthCorps high school . The HealthCorps coordinator build Alliance 's collaborative guideline train enhance collaboration active Wellness Council . In addition , build youth leadership thereby obtain student support , research team work closely exist HealthCorps youth leadership program address issue relate family , ( home food environment ) , school ( food service , garden ) community ( food options/ NYC Department Health nutrition program - Adopt-A-Bodega , Health Bucks farmer ' market , Green Cart produce stand ) . During wait-listed phase , study provide additional support wait-listed HealthCorps control school , beyond HealthCorps training/support program . However , investigator provide train technical support relate FitnessGram measurement data collection , consistent approach use school-based participatory research project achieve measurement fidelity control school . The outcomes simulation expand type data use include survey 's psychosocial variable extensive administrative data attendance , demographic , reduced/free lunch student , teacher parent school evaluation . The simulation analysis also integrate data control student receive intervention . This group student consider third arm , list intervention control student three arm trial .</detailed_description>
