	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity globally Singapore continue rise despite increased public awareness effort control weight . Its association chronic metabolic disease , include diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , signify serious implication obesity public health . There remain , however , scientific consensus optimal method weight loss maintenance long period time . The Atkins diet introduce late 1990s since fuel popularity use high-protein diet weight loss . Scientific evidence since show high-protein diet effective conventional low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet produce great weight loss , least short-term . More importantly , high-protein diet also reduce amount lean tissue lose weight loss may help maintain weight loss great extent conventional diet . However , high-protein diet also know raise esterol , albeit improve TG HDL-cholesterol level . This could due high amount saturate fat accompany food rich animal protein . In addition , high-protein diet may lower bone mineral density impact kidney function . High-protein diet also expensive conventional low-fat , high carbohydrate food , important consideration long term compliance . Supplements contain branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA : leucine , isoleucine valine ) commonly use among muscle builder athletic community . BCAAs show stimulate protein synthesis preserve lean mass . While study examine BCAA supplementation low protein diet weight loss find depletion essential amino acid , effect BCAA supplementation moderate-protein hypocaloric diet lean mass preservation weight loss energy-restricted obese patient , knowledge , investigate . Compared consume high ( animal ) protein diet , also rich BCAAs , take BCAA supplement would much convenient affordable way obtain similar great quantity BCAA , without adverse health effect high-protein load body . In study investigator primarily aim investigate overweight/obese subject , whether BCAA-supplemented ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet ( BCAA ) compare standard ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet ( CT ) result great lean mass preservation , rest diet-induced energy expenditure , improve insulin sensitivity . Investigators also examine effect lean mass preservation insulin sensitivity change BCAA-supplemented diet high-protein hypocaloric diet ( HP ) . As secondary aim , investigator also power study examine BCAA-supplemented diet add advantage high-protein diet incur less negative effect bone mineral density renal function . In addition , investigator determine participant 's compliance diet versus supplement weight loss maintenance strategy . The finding study provide u novel insight BCAA-supplementation hypocaloric diet . If study successful , BCAA-supplementation hypocaloric diet could provide alternative standard ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet weight reduction strategy without attend potential health risk high protein load e.g . reduce bone mineral density detrimental effect renal function . There three main hypothesis investigator propose examine . Hypothesis 1 : A BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet ( BCAA ) would lead great lean mass preservation weight loss compare standard ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet ( CT ) . Diets vary diet composition , include low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet high-protein , low-carbohydrate diet test search optimal macronutrient composition weight loss . High-protein diet highly favored ability initiate great initial weight loss . However , accumulative data recent study show significant difference amount weight loss high-protein diet traditional ( normally low-fat , high-carbohydrate ) energy-restricted diet long term ( 16 week 1 year ) . It appear total energy intake , rather diet composition , important determinant long term weight loss . However , override advantage high-protein diet favorable effect body composition , preserve great lean mass , compare high-carbohydrate diet , weight loss adult obese patient , independent energy intake . A recent meta-analysis demonstrate high protein diet ( protein &gt; 1.05g/kg body weight ) associate 1.21 kg additional fat-free mass retention compare diet low protein intake . Lean mass fat-free mass main determinant basal ( rest ) energy expenditure . Its great preservation would reduce weight loss-induced decrease energy expenditure , might two important implication . Firstly , high basal energy expenditure weight loss could lead great weight loss amount calorie consume . Secondly , amount lean mass preserve end weight loss might mitigate weight regain maintenance phase weight loss , i.e . success weight maintenance . Branched-chain amino acid like leucine , isoleucine valine substrates protein synthesis also potent nutrient regulate protein metabolism . Supplementation leucine leucine-rich protein source suggest develop muscle mass prevent protein loss condition characterize muscle protein waste . In human study , use leucine leucine-rich protein source supplementation well-investigated optimize effect exercise body composition.Several study examine impact chronic ( average 3 month ) leucine-rich amino acid supplementation healthy elderly human , demonstrate significant improvement lean body mass , muscle strength physical capacity . Whether lean mass preservation high-protein hypocaloric diet due presence high amount BCAA content less clear . Two study examine use whey protein ( rich BCAA ) weight loss uncertain benefit enhance weight loss less lean muscle loss attribute BCAA alone due enrichment nutrient like calcium bioactive peptide whey protein fraction . It also clear whether animal source protein ( rich BCAAs ) beneficial plant source protein energy expenditure , body composition , satiety fat loss . To investigator ' knowledge , study specifically examine beneficial effect BCAA supplementation moderate-protein diet lean mass preservation weight loss energy-restricted obese patient . Investigators hypothesize similar high-protein diet ( show literature ) , BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet would also lead great lean mass preservation standard ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet weight loss . In addition , investigator want examine effect lean mass preservation BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet high protein hypocaloric diet . Hypothesis 2 : Improvement insulin sensitivity BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet ( BCAA ) great standard ( moderate-protein ) hypocaloric diet ( CT ) . The insulin stimulate effect proteins maybe mediate specific amino acid , make potent modulators insulin action glucose metabolism . In animal model , BCAA supplementation find improve glucose tolerance stimulate glucose uptake skeletal muscle mechanism involve glycogen synthase activity . While energy restriction weight loss positive effect insulin sensitivity , whether diet composition impact insulin sensitivity still inconclusive . Several study find significant improvement insulin sensitivity high-protein diet compare control diet , independent weight loss , others . As skeletal muscle mass major determinate insulin sensitivity , investigator postulate due great lean mass preservation , BCAA diet would result great improvement insulin sensitivity compare CT diet . Hypothesis 3 : The BCAA-supplementation diet ( BCAA ) would easier adhere less detrimental effect bone mineral density renal function high-protein diet ( HP ) , lead good ( short-term ) weight maintenance less weight regain . Maintaining weight loss great challenge weight loss process may easily achieve . Studies show weight regain significantly less subject high-protein group compare control group six month year weight-maintenance diet . In study , study food provide may reflect real-life free-living situation weight maintenance phase . Achieving high-protein diet long term costly require careful plan meal . To extent subject continue maintain diet composition weight loss diet accord energy balance weight maintenance well-investigated The effectiveness long term BCAA supplementation hypocaloric diet also fully investigate . If BCAA supplementation could induce similar metabolic improvement high-protein diet weight loss phase , might help maintain body weight easy administration great compliance long term . In study , investigator propose provide BCAA supplement BCAA group placebo supplement provide HP CT group throughout entire study ( weight loss maintenance phase ) . Study food , however , provide weight loss phase . Investigators speculate overall , adherence supplementation would better adherence respective diet composition end weight maintenance phase subject three group . Investigators hypothesize subject HP BCAA diet less weight regain initial weight maintenance phase ( due great lean mass ) CT group , BCAA group least weight regain end weight maintenance phase due good compliance . Concerns raise safety high-protein diet . Studies indicate increase protein intake associate increased renal calcium excretion , negative calcium balance , bone resorption cause hyperfiltration . At time , also know loss bone mass often accompany weight loss induce calorie restriction . Whether high-protein diet detrimental impact bone mineral density renal function still inconclusive . In study , investigator hypothesize BCAA-supplemented diet would result less detrimental effect bone mineral density renal function high-protein diet .</detailed_description>
