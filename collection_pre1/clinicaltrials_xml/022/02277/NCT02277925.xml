	<brief_summary>Primary Aim : The primary aim randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare vaginal mesh suture exposure rate woman undergo robotic total hysterectomy sacrocolpopexy light-weight polypropylene mesh ( Upsylon™ y-mesh ) use permanent ( polytetrafluoroethylene , Gore-Tex ) versus delay absorbable monofilament ( 2-0 polydioxanone , PDS ) suture 1-year . Secondary Aims : 1 . To compare 1-year composite success rate ( lead edge prolapse hymen apex descend less 1/3 vaginal length , subjective feeling bulge ; retreatment pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) vaginal mesh exposure ) permanent versus delay absorbable suture mesh graft attachment robotic total hysterectomy sacrocolpopexy . 2 . To compare postoperative symptom pelvic floor disorder , include urinary incontinence , void dysfunction , pelvic organ prolapse , sexual dysfunction quality life 2 group 1 year . 3 . To evaluate adverse outcome group , classify accord Clavien-Dindo system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse common 13 % 1 19 % 2,3 woman undergo surgical repair . Reconstructive pelvic surgery broadly divide procedure rely exist native tissue versus use graft augmentation , either synthetic biologic material . Native tissue vaginal repair , associate low rate surgical complications,4 high rate recurrent prolapse . A recent randomized trial uterosacral versus sacrospinous ligament fixation POP demonstrate 30 % recurrence rate 2 years.3 Abdominal sacrocolpopexy ( SCP ) consider durable operation advance pelvic organ prolapse reoperation rate less 5 % .5-7 Minimally-invasive technique SCP , robotic-assistance , associate improved recovery time less cost abdominal SCP without demonstrable difference efficacy.8,9 While traditionally reserve woman vaginal vault prolapse , SCP increasingly consider primary surgical option woman present uterovaginal prolapse attempt improve longer-term surgical outcome . The optimal management uterus cervix case unclear . Rationale total versus supracervical hysterectomy concomitant SCP While supracervical hysterectomy concomitant SCP associate low rate mesh exposure,10-12 potential negative consequence supracervical hysterectomy include morcellation unanticipated uterine malignancy,13 cervical stump prolapse/elongation , cyclic vaginal bleeding , reduce anterior vaginal support ( Myers EM , Matthews et al. , press ) . When conduct supracervical hysterectomy , power morcellators common method use extract amputated uterine corpus . The potential risk power morcellation recently highlight FDA safety notification focus potential disseminate fragment undiagnosed uterine leiomyosarcoma throughout abdomen , negatively impact prognosis ( http : //www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm393576.htm ) . With recent development focus shift towards perform total hysterectomy delivery intact specimen vagina . Vaginal mesh exposure problematic complication abdominal SCP minimally invasive SCP . Widely disparate rate mesh exposure range 0 % 14 27 % 15 report . A systematic review ASCP outcomes 2004 report overall rate 3.4 % ,6 recent meta-analysis robotic-assisted SCP report overall rate 2 % .16 Some consistent risk factor mesh exposure non-Type 1 polypropylene mesh ( knit , small-pore mesh material ) smoking.17,18 Some study identify total hysterectomy significant risk factor . In evaluation patient enrol CARE trial , 6 % evidence mesh exposure 2 year , concomitant hysterectomy present almost 5-fold increased risk.18 The rate 6 year rise 10.5 % . 5 More 50 % subject trial , however , non-Type 1 polypropylene mesh . Akyol et al . demonstrated 2-fold increase risk ( 12 % ) 19 Bensinger et al . 7-fold increase risk ( 8.2 % ) 20 concomitant total hysterectomy . In contrast , 4 retrospective study Type1 polypropylene mesh use reveal increased risk mesh erosion concomitant total hysterectomy.14,21-23 These widely discrepant rate mesh exposure may relate surgical technique , graft material and/or suture material use mesh attachment . Rationale need study suture material mesh attachment SCP The effect suture mesh exposure may significant concomitant hysterectomy mesh type . At UNC , report mesh exposure use permanent suture mesh attachment SCP without concomitant total hysterectomy , rate 8 % 1 year.24 There evidence delay absorbable suture may reduce risk mesh suture erosion . In retrospective review compare braid permanent suture delay absorbable monofilament suture SCP mesh attachment , rate mesh exposure reduce absorbable suture group ( 3.7 % vs 0 % ) , associate POP recurrence.25 Similarly , another retrospective review , delay absorbable monofilament suture use SCP mesh attachment 67 woman undergo total abdominal hysterectomy SCP , mesh exposure note median follow 27 months.26 The use permanent suture vaginal mesh attachment historically advocate mean reduce POP recurrence risk ; yet , prospective study definitively answered question . The tradeoff use permanent suture may increase risk mesh suture exposure , permanent suture breach vaginal epithelium may serve nidus bacterial seeding , theoretically increase risk mesh exposure . As SCP appear durable procedure woman advance uterovaginal prolapse , urgent need identify ideal method vaginal mesh attachment minimize risk mesh-related complication maintain effectiveness POP repair . Choice mesh material Upsylon™ ( Boston Scientific , Natick , MA ) pre-formed Y-mesh light-weight ( 25 g/m2 ) , compose Type I polypropylene material , pore size 2.8 mm2 surface area ration 1.11 . It FDA approve 2012 . The mesh blue color may aide ability detect even small area mesh exposure erosion . No data currently exist regard performance particular mesh product SCP . It light mesh weight IntePro™ y-mesh ( American Medical Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) , previously use comparative trial robotic abdominal SCP mesh exposure rate 8 % . The primary aim randomize trial , therefore , test hypothesis use Upsylon™ mesh delay absorbable suture mesh attachment time robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy SCP reduce risk vaginal mesh and/or suture exposure compare permanent monofilament suture . Secondary aim include evaluation effect light-weight mesh absorbable suture prolapse quality life outcomes surgical complication 1 year surgery .</detailed_description>
