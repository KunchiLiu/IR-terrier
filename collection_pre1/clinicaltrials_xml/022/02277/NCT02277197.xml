	<brief_summary>The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) oncogene prognostic biomarker head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . EGFR 's functional importance HNSCC result development first molecularly target strategy , anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab . Given lack therapeutic option patient recurrent/metastatic HNSCC failure cetuximab , strong scientific interest understand resistance order identify new therapy population . A possible resistance mechanism anti-EGFR therapy HNSCC primary compensatory activation alternate growth factor receptor include c-Met . The MET oncogene encode c-Met , RTK bind exclusively ligand , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) . The HGF/c-Met signal pathway converges EGFR network PI3K/Akt MAPK node . Laboratory data suggest ability reciprocal compensation EGFR c-Met . We hypothesize HGF/c-Met pathway inhibition may overcome resistance cetuximab patient HNSCC , clinical cetuximab resistance . Ficlatuzumab ( AV-299 ) humanize HGF-inhibitory immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody . The primary objective phase 1b study find recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination ficlatuzumab cetuximab patient recurrent/metastaticHNSCC . The dose-finding study design follow Narayana k-in-a-row design k set 2 target 33 % rate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . In dose-finding phase , total 8 patient treat DLTs observe 14 patient least one DLT occur . An expansion cohort proceed RP2D 12 patient treat dose level combination ficlatuzumab cetuximab . We evaluate biomarkers HGF/cMet pathway activation baseline tissue , plasma immune cell preliminary relationship clinical activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ficlatuzumab Cetuximab Recurrent/Metastatic Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1b , single arm , open-labeled study ficlatuzumab cetuximab recurrent/metastatic HNSCC biomarker correlative . The primary objective study establish recommended-for-phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination ficlatuzumab Cetuximab . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue disease progression one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression , - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , - Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , - Patient decide withdraw study , - General specific change patient condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . After progressive disease , subject follow survival every 3 month 2 year . Cetuximab ficlatuzumab administer every week day 1 15 28-day cycle . Ficlatuzumab administer IV infusion , 30-60 minutes,10 mg/kg every 2 week , day first dose cetuximab . Ficlatuzumab administer 30-60 minute completion cetuximab infusion . Cetuximab administer prior ficlatuzumab IV infusion . The first dose administer 120 minute ( ± 15 minute ) . Subsequent dos may infuse 60 minute ( ± 15 minute ) .The start dose cetuximab ( dose tier 1 ) 500 mg/m2 every 2 week . Subjects monitor adverse event toxicity study treatment 30 day last dose ficlatuzumab . Blood drawn correlative study baseline , end every even cycle . Prior initiation protocol treatment , patient undergo mandatory research biopsy .</detailed_description>
