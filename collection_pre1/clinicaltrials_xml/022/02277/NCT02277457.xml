	<brief_summary>Hypotheses : Short-term - Targeted therapy erlotinib crizotinib plus PART ( Personalized Adaptive Radiation Therapy ) safe yield favorable outcome patient stage III , EGFR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) + ALK ( Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ) + NSCLC ( Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ) . Long-term - In patient stage III NSCLC harbor driver mutation , treatment relevant target agent plus PART improve local-regional systemic tumor control result improve survival relative standard chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Adaptive Radiation Therapy With Individualized Systemic Targeted Therapy ( PARTIST ) Locally Advanced , Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Genomic Driver Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose trial pilot study accrue 30 patient inoperable stage IIIA/B NSCLC harbor either EGFR mutation ( n=20 ) ALK rearrangement ( n=10 ) . Patients EGFR+ tumor treat erlotinib 150 mg orally QD ; patient ALK+ tumor treat crizotinib 250 mg orally BID . Treatment consist six week concurrent PART plus erlotinib crizotinib , follow erlotinib crizotinib total 1 year . All patient treat response-driven PART dose intensify active ( FDG-avid ) region base mid-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan maintain dose limit organs-at-risk . The primary endpoint PFS OS . Primary analyse perform separately ALK+ EGFR+ patient . The secondary endpoint treatment-related toxicity focus pneumonitis esophagitis strict stopping rule place . Current standard therapy affords suboptimal outcome patient locally advanced NSCLC due locoregional distant recurrence . Since target therapy effective chemotherapy patient relevant driver mutation , best way significantly improve outcome subgroup patient optimize systemic therapy target agent improve local control PET-adapted , high-dose RT .</detailed_description>
