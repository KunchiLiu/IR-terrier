	<brief_summary>This observational study develop new hypothesis regard dynamic safety switch natalizumab fingolimod : - Comparison disease activity ( clinical MRI ) year change therapy comparison year change - Dynamic onset disease activity stop treatment natalizumab - Change immunological parameter treatment change natalizumab fingolimod comparison clinical MRI measure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disease Control RRMS Transferring Treatment From Natalizumab Fingolimod</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) upon treatment natalizumab increase time , least 3rd year therapy . Many Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient currently treat natalizumab , well physician , look alternative MS treatment , fingolimod one . In transfer patient natalizumab fingolimod , know co-administration lead increase risk adverse effect due share feature immunomodulation mechanism action . Therefore sufficient washout period natalizumab discontinuation fingolimod initiation desirable . However , balance increase risk time recur disease activity patient untreated . This study prospectively evaluate safe switch patient natalizumab fingolimod treatment follow cessation natalizumab treatment , cohort RRMS patient . Safety propose transition paradigm define traditional safety measure also recurrence disease activity washout period 8 week cessation natalizumab treatment follow fingolimod treatment initiation . An interim analysis first 15 patient reveal clinical MRI activity 38.5 64.3 % respectively . Therefore short interval define subject enter study october 2013 : interval define 4 week patient . Overall , study aim provide guidance physician management natalizumab-treated patient transition fingolimod treatment consider appropriate treatment alternative . An evidence base rationale change 4 8 week wash period possible due miss evidence . Due know risk PML patient treat natalizumab 2 year , start fingolimod natalizumab therapy seem inappropriate , elevate risk JC Virus ( JCV ) manifestation could expect constellation . On hand considerable shorten 8-weeks interval could favorable prevent clinical MRI activity . An interval 4 week last dose natalizumab first dose fingolimod seem appropriate compromise balance risk benefit treatment transition . Fingolimod Natalizumab influence immune system completely different way . It therefore highly interesting monitor clinical disease activity MRI activity , also study immunological response switch phase drug . The change therapy natalizumab fingolimod pose possible risk . On one hand MS could reactivate start fingolimod delay long , hand infectious problem could emerge fingolimod start early patient treat two concomitant immunomodulators . Analyzing immune response critical Switch period may help identify marker predict recrudescence disease activity severe suppression immune response . It known natalizumab block migration lymphocytes via endothelial cell interaction integrins . More recently , describe natalizumab influence also gene expression profile lymphocytes blockade migration endothelial cell might constant clinical effect predicts . In contrast natalizumab , fingolimod block egress lymphocyte secondary lymphoid organ ( SLO ) lymph node . This effect mediate functional antagonization sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) receptor lymphocytes fingolimod . Due different expression lymph node home receptor naïve central memory T-cells regularly circulate SLO consequently prone sequestration SLO effector memory cell circulate SLO regular basis . This reflected decrease naïve central memory cell relative increase effector memory cell peripheral blood fingolimod treat patient . So far , effect concomitant treatment natalizumab fingolimod immune system study . The different aspect immune modulation drug study . At baseline early follow-up visit ( 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 week ) aim : - ass alteration composition myeloid cell lymphocyte subpopulation ( i.e . naïve , central memory effector memory regulatory T cell , B cell ) adhesion molecule expression peripheral blood - measure autoantigen specific T cell proliferation Interferon gamma ( IFNγ ) production - characterize transcriptomics alteration ( include messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) small non-coding RNA expression ) lymphocytes MS-patients - ass change plasma cytokine , chemokine , Matrix metalloproteinase level - ass migratory capacity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) For patient recruit october 2013 short wash period , neuroimmunological analysis omit .</detailed_description>
