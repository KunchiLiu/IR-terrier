	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) common cancer arise upper aerodigestive tract , sixth lead incident cancer worldwide . Despite advance multimodality therapy , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) 40-60 % , increase incrementally past two decade . The current standard care primary nonsurgical management locally advance HNSCC concurrent cisplatin-radiotheray , significantly improve OS , progression-free survival , locoregional control compare radiotherapy alone landmark Intergroup trial 0126 . The MET proto-oncogene encodes c-Met , heterodimeric growth factor receptor bound exclusively ligand , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) . In laboratory , activation HGF/c-Met pathway associate resistance cisplatin radiotherapy HNSCC . We hypothesize addition HGF/c-Met pathway inhibitor cisplatin-radiotherapy may improve outcome HNSCC . Ficlatuzumab ( AV-299 ) humanize HGF-inhibitory IgG1 monoclonal antibody . The primary objective study establish recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination ficlatuzumab , cisplatin intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , patient locally advanced HNSCC . The dose-finding study design follow Narayana k-in-a-row design k set 3 target 33 % DLT rate . In dose-finding phase , total either 10 14 patient treat . If DLTs observe among 10 patient , high dose tier declare RP2D . Otherwise RP2D estimate DLTs across dose level isotonic regression . The secondary objective estimate biomarker association preliminary clinical response . We evaluate biomarkers HGF/cMet pathway activation tumor tissue , plasma , immune cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ficlatuzumab , Cisplatin IMRT Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase Ib trial ficlatuzumab add standard care locally advance HNSCC : cisplatin-IMRT . Biomarkers HGF/cMet pathway activation may associate clinical response develop expansion cohort . Patients high intermediate risk , locally advanced HNSCC eligible . A diagnostic primary tumor block biomarker correlatives mandatory inclusion study . A representative paraffin block original diagnosis repeat biopsy , available , submit . The start dose ficlatuzumab ( dose tier 1 ) 10 mg/kg every 2 week , begin week prior cisplatin-IMRT ( week -1 ) . Ficlatuzumab administer IV infusion 30-60 minute , total 4 dos . The start dose cisplatin ( dose tier 1 ) 40 mg/m2 weekly , begin concurrent IMRT week 1 study treatment ( one week follow first dose ficlatuzumab administer week -1 study treatment ) . Patients receive cisplatin weekly IV infusion 60 minute , total 7 dos . Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation require . Any treatment planning delivery system credentialed head neck IMRT acceptable . Immobilization perform thermoplastic mask ensure daily reproducibility setup . Treatment plan CT scan require define tumor , clinical planning target volumes.The treatment plan CT scan acquire patient position immobilization device treatment perform IV contrast major vessel neck easily visualize . Four dose tier consider phase I portion ficlatuzumab cisplatin . IMRT remain consistent dose tier . Under schema , one patient enrol time . However de novo dose escalation occur 2 patient complete study treatment without DLT . In dose-finding phase , total 10 patient treat DLTs observe 14 patient least one DLT occur . If DLTs observe among first 10 patient recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) set dose tier 3 . If DLT observe 14 patient treat observed , RP2D estimate DLTs across dose level isotonic regression . The observation period identify DLT 10 week , 2 week follow completion IMRT , whichever come later . To consider DLT , toxicity must least possibly related ficlatuzumab . An expansion cohort proceed RP2D 12 patient treat dose level . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue one follow criterion applies : - Completion treatment , - Disease progression , - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , - Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , - Patient decide withdraw study , - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . After complete treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , total 5 year completion IMRT . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event ( ) follow resolution stabilization adverse event .</detailed_description>
