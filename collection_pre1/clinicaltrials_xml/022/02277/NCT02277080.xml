	<brief_title>The Immune Endocrine Systems Chronic Non-cancer Patients Treated With Opioids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Epidemiological data US Denmark show 3-5 % population use opioids treatment chronic pain condition . Long-term use opioids may cause `` classic '' opioid-induced adverse effect , also serious consequence hyperalgesia , cognitive disorder , suppression immune endocrine system . Relatively study suggest substance affect hormone function human . The best studied circumstance regard sex hormone . A single systematic study several clinical observation suggest pituitary-adrenal function formation growth hormone also reduce opioids . Other study show hormone change treatment opioids , immunological function also affect . There show link immunological hormonal function part immune system also affect pituitary-adrenal function . Opioid use misuse per se long suspect associated infection innate adaptive immune system get affected number mechanism . This study investigate possibility hormonal disorder contribute factor development cognitive impairment patient opioid treatment . The applies patient ' well-being , mood pain perception . STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional study carry Multidisciplinary Pain Centre , Rigshospitalet , investigate opioid treat chronic non-cancer patient . These patient treat one opioid one month compare age , educational sex match control group chronic non-cancer patient treat analgesic . STUDY SAMPLE The study explorative study 25 opioid treat patient 25 control . The patient include excluded either group basis specific criterion . If hypothesis study seem confirm patient include order investigate effect different opioid substance . METHOD Data collect trained medical student , administer instrument retrieve information patient ' file . Hormone assay The adrenocortical function test 30 min ACTH test . Leydig-cell function , IGF , TSH , thyroxine prolactine measure well . Immunology Fresh whole blood use flow cytometry , amount different cell immune system measure . Furthermore , plasma sample ( snap frozen ) collect ( biobank ) . The follow cell type analyze use flow cytometry : NK cell , B cell T cell . To study immune response fresh whole blood stimulate pathogen . Production cytokine examine analyzes culture supernatant . Possible alteration inflammation determine analyse plasma sample . Establishment research biobank All material collect part study . A biobank establish blood sample safely store Rigshospitalet long study go . The purpose research biobank use sample follow-up study . Assessment cognitive function Regarding neuropsychological assessment , two instrument select : 1 . CRT measure sustain attention vigilance . It computer test , headphone , 100 auditory signal deliver patient random interval . The patient instruct press button soon sound heard . 2 . DST assess attention/concentration , recent work memory . Patients ask repeat series number increase length , forward ( direct ) backward ( reverse ) order . Pain evaluation Patients ' pain intensity assess use Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) measure pain bad , least average last 24 hour current pain intensity . Mood Depression anxiety evaluate use Hospitality Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . Scores 8 indicates depressive anxiety disorder likely present . Health-related quality life The Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) also include self-administered questionnaire . The SF-36 36-item survey measure eight dimension health . Higher score SF-36 ( range 0 100 ) indicate good health-related quality life . RESULTS The result analyse use specific statistic tool descriptive variable , primary outcome , secondary outcome , significance level , clinical significance .</detailed_description>
