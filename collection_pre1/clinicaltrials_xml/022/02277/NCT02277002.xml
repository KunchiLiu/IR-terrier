	<brief_summary>Traffic relate air pollution well-recognised much study contributor smog link number adverse health outcome . Although traffic pollutant travel long distance , exposure high level raw emission occur close source ; e.g . car dense traffic condition . Time spent in-vehicle may contribute half commuter ' daily exposure certain air pollutant . Most new car allow cabin air filter , know well cabin air filtration reduce exposure traffic-related air pollution . This intervention study measure commuter ' exposure air pollutant rush hour traffic . It evaluate impact exposure stress hormone saliva , short term cardiopulmonary health indicator blood pressure , heart rate variability respiratory inflammation . It also look effect cognition ( mental processing judgement ) real world environment deficit could important safety . In addition , study examine whether cabin air filtration reduce exposure traffic relate air pollutant result improvement short term cardiopulmonary cognitive function . This research contribute understand environment contributes Canadians ' overall air pollution exposure well potential health impact . It also test potentially valuable economical mean reduce exposure traffic relate air pollution commute environment . The study may also guide future implementation use cabin filter exposure reduction intervention . Overall Project Objectives : Can cabin air filtration effectively reduce exposure traffic relate air pollution ? Does commuter exposure air pollution affect short term stress , cardiopulmonary cognitive function ? Can cabin air filtration mitigate health effect commuter ' exposure air pollution ?</brief_summary>
