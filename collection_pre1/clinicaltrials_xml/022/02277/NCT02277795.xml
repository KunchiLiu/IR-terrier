	<brief_title>Evaluation AccuCirc Early Infant Male Circumcision Nyanza , Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male circumcision ( MC ) research-tested , evidence-based HIV prevention strategy show cost-saving . Randomized trial provide compelling evidence MC reduce men 's risk heterosexually-acquired HIV-1 infection 60 % . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend MC part comprehensive HIV prevention strategy say , `` Since neonatal circumcision less complicated risky procedure circumcision perform young boy , adolescent adults â€¦ country consider promote neonatal circumcision safe , culturally acceptable sustainable manner . '' In 2010 , WHO publish `` Manual early infant male circumcision local anaesthesia , [ 6 ] '' , include Mogen , Gomco Plastibell device . At time publication , AccuCirc relatively new ( approve United States Food Drug Administration 2007 ) promise device facilitate scale-up early infant male circumcision ( EIMC ) . It must , however , undergo field evaluation include WHO 's list prequalified EIMC device accessible programmatic adoption . The investigator propose implementation study address several salient operation research question remain regard role device scale-up EIMC program sub-Saharan Africa . This study include field evaluation AccuCirc device aim provide data would allow evaluation device WHO prequalification . Other aspect current study aim understand EIMC optimize successfully implement routine public health setting . The investigator therefore propose follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Complete field evaluation AccuCirc device EIMC Nyanza Province , Kenya , target enrollment 600 infant , include intensive follow-up first 50 infant undergoing EIMC AccuCirc device . Aim 2 : Qualitatively ass provider experience preference regard EIMC device relationship future routine provision EIMC . Research staff train provider Mogen clamp AccuCirc device ask compare benefit drawback perceive device , possible implication scale-up . Aim 3 : Assess parental decision-making EIMC use qualitative method , include whether device EIMC would influence parental decision-making circumcision son . Parents inform risk benefit EIMC general , Mogen clamp AccuCirc specifically , qualitative data decision-making gather . Aim 4 : Identify factor associate male infant circumcise , include , , EIMC service offer mother , role device EIMC decision-making , . Mothers whose infant circumcise comparison group mother uncircumcised infant administer questionnaire identify factor associate uptake EIMC whether device affect circumcision decision .</detailed_description>
