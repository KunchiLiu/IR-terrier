	<brief_summary>According World Health Organization , hundred million patient affect health-care associated infection worldwide year , result prolonged hospital stay , long-term disability , death , financial loss health system . The common hospital-acquired infection Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) , account almost 40 % nosocomial infection . Most hospital-acquired UTIs associate catheterization . In fact , urinary catheter-related bacteriuria common health care associate infection worldwide . Catheter-associated UTI ( CAUTI ) develop follow adhesion planktonic bacteria surface catheter colonization , create persistent environment call biofilm . The nature biofilm structure together physiological attribute biofilm organisms confers inherent resistance various antimicrobial agent antibiotic , disinfectant germicide , augment potential pathogen cause infection catheterize patient . Nitric oxide ( NO ) naturally-produced gas molecule broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity . NO used clinic treat pulmonary hypertension neonate adult . Studies show low-dose NO associated prevention biofilm formation , biofilm dispersal elimination bacteria . It suggest NO prevents bacteria attachment catheter surface inhibit biofilm formation mechanism involve reduction modification proteins mediate cell-substrate cell-cell interaction . The investigator team , use proprietary technology impregnate urinary catheter NO ( i.e . NO-impregnated catheter ) . These catheter release low concentration NO following exposure urine 14-day period . In vitro study show NO-impregnated catheter prevent bacterial colonization biofilm formation Escherichia coli exterior luminal surface catheter . In addition , NO release catheter able eradicate 4log colony form unit/ml bacteria within surround medium . Moreover , NO-impregnated catheter exhibit superior performance compare silver-coated catheter , similar anti-infective property compare antibiotic-coated catheter . Primary objective : To assess safety tolerability NO-impregnated catheter patient older 18 year old undergoing radical prostatectomy catheterize 7-14 day .</brief_summary>
