	<brief_summary>This pilot study aid development sonographic screening method use obtain proxy measure LBM estimate muscle composition relate Intramuscular adipose tissue ( IMAT ) , lipid metabolism , insulin resistance . Typically , age-related muscle loss assess old adult begin show sign trouble manage life independently . In addition loss independence typically see diminish muscle mass function ( sarcopenia ) , age-related change lean body mass negative effect insulin sensitivity . The investigator central hypothesis muscle characteristic derive ultrasound ( US ) significantly associate estimate dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) LBM , CT scan measure IMAT , estimate insulin sensitivity , serum level inflammatory cytokine macrophage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal project : 1 ) develop validate rapid , portable , cost-effective , screen method sarcopenia use diagnostic ultrasound ( US ) , 2 ) determine US screen method provide viable estimate intramuscular adipose tissue ( IMAT ) since muscle tissue age-related change muscle composition associate low muscle torque metabolic dysfunction . The propose US screen method may use proxy measure LBM provide estimate skeletal muscle composition relate IMAT , lipid metabolism , insulin resistance inflammation - important factor may impact impaired mobility metabolic dysfunction old African American Veterans . Aim 1 : Determine association proxy measure LBM obtain via portable , diagnostic , musculoskeletal US LBM determine dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . The working hypothesis 6-muscle model LBM derive US DXA LBM value exhibit significant positive association attain coefficient determination &gt; .80 . Aim 2 : Determine association US echointensity feature IMAT determine CT scan . US echointensity value acquire rectus femoris analyze determine association IMAT . The work hypothesis high echointensity value measure grayscale analysis negatively associate Hounsfield unit obtain CT scan ( p &lt; .05 ) . Aim 3 : Examine association US echointensity value biologic factor impair insulin sensitivity . Excessive IMAT intra-myocellular triglyceride level result increase level biologic factor inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-Î± , IL-6 , IL-10 ) , polarize macrophage , unoxidized long-chain fatty acyl CoAs ( LCFA-CoAs ) , acylcarnitine conjugate may impair insulin sensitivity . The investigator hypothesis proxy measure IMAT via echointensity value positively associate biomarkers inflammation , fatty acid metabolic intermediate , homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , HbA1C .</detailed_description>
