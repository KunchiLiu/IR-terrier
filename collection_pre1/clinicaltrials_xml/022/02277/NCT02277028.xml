	<brief_summary>This study compare bilateral priming follow task specific train health care education follow task specific train protocol . The intention understand effect prim upper limb train post-stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bilateral Priming Upper Extremity Hemiparesis Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Techniques enhance use dependent plasticity examine stroke rehabilitation research . The purpose technique prime cortex prior training . The prim technique previously describe literature include medication ( i.e . amphetamine ) , transcranial electric magnetic stimulation , manipulation somatosensory input . Here , investigator examine prim technique non-invasive free side effect . The technique describe study us bilateral , symmetrical , rhythmic movement `` bilateral priming '' purpose ready motor cortex functional limb training . A `` rocker '' use less affected limb drive affect one symmetrical wrist flexion extension . In project , investigator intend compare bilateral upper limb prim task specfiic training health care education website program follow task specific train experimental group.This active comparator ( health care education ) receive stroke relate health education via website American Heart Association . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation willl include measurement transcallosal inhibition persistence affect hemisphere less affected hemisphere vice versa ( less affected affect ) . The investigator expect bilateral prim group great change transcranial magnetic stimulation measure great improvement behavioral measure time point .</detailed_description>
