	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics , Efficacy Safety Intravenous Golimumab Pediatric Participants With Active Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , Open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multi-center ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study determine pharmacokinetics ( study way drug enters leave blood tissue time ) , efficacy ( effectiveness ) safety intravenous golimumab participant pJIA despite current treatment methotrexate ( MTX ) . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase ( 6 week ) , Open-label Treatment Phase ( consist golimumab MTX treatment 244 week , wherein Week 28 , MTX dose change allow ) Follow-up Phase ( 8 week ) . The maximal study duration participant exceed 258 week . All eligible participant administer golimumab IV infusion commercial MTX . Blood sample collect evaluation pharmacokinetics study treatment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
