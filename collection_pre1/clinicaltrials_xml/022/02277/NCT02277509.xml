	<detailed_description>The pilot testing ( Einstein Institutional Review Board Protocol # 2010-491 ) demonstrate acceptability feasibility implement culturally linguistically Chinese DPP lifestyle protocol . The pilot study find intervention result significant weight loss trend glycemic ( HbA1c ) improvement among Chinese immigrant prediabetes . The planned R01 fund study address large scale implementation inform wider spread dissemination within United States globally . Our specific aim : Aim 1 . Evaluate clinical effectiveness implementation model cluster randomize trial . Primary endpoint include change weight glycemia ( HbA1c ) one year randomization . Secondary endpoint include cardiovascular risk marker , lifestyle ( dietary intake physical activity ) self-reported quality life . Aim 2 . Evaluate study generalizability use RE-AIM ( reach , efficacy/effectiveness , adoption , implementation maintenance ) framework . The specific evaluation question include : Reach : How many eligible patient enrol ? How representative study participant underlie population ? Efficacy/Effectiveness : How intervention affect participant ' outcome measure ? Adoption : How acceptable intervention component participant ? Implementation : How many intervention component provide plan ? Maintenance : How much 1-year intervention effect sustainable 2-year follow-up ? What mechanisms available sustain intervention ? Aim 3 . Evaluate cost-effectiveness implementation model respect weight glycemic ( HbA1c ) change . Aim 4 . Disseminate `` lesson learn '' effective program component expand access effective program within United States via registry develop Centers Disease Control DPP intervention sit explore global dissemination issue via partnership Confucius Institute .</detailed_description>
