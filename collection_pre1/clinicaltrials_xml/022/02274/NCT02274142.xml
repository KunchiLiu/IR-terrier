	<brief_title>Cost-effectiveness ART Using Encapsulated Powder-liquid Glass Ionomer Cement : Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study approve research ethic committee School Dentistry ( University São Paulo , Brazil ) write informed consent obtain parent legal guardian participate child . The sample size calculate base minimum difference 10 % success rate control treatment group 1 year follow-up , α 5 % power ( strength ) 80 % use paired test . As one tooth might enrol treatment , must add 20 % clustering , also 20 % possible loss . To include study follow criterion must follow : healthy , cooperative child least one occlusal carious lesion primary molar extend dentin dimension great 2 mm occlusal-cervical intact edge list . Also , include tooth present ulcer , abscess , fistula , pathological mobility . Implementation : All occlusal proximal-ART restoration perform two operator dental chair . The operator assist local dentist dentist assistant , previously train mix GIC accord manufacturer ' protocol . The child randomly assign two group : Hand mix encapsulated material . Treatment procedure : The ART technique perform accord ART guideline propose Frencken ( 2014 ) . No local anaesthesia use treatment . Infected carious dentin remove hand instrument . The use hand instrument dentin surface result smear layer need remove use dentine conditioner . The liquid component hand-mixed powder-liquid GIC , contain acid component , use saliva isolation do cotton wool roll . The cavity restore one two GIC brand : Fuji IX ( GC Europe , Leuven , BE ) EQUIA ( GC Europe , Leuven , BE ) . A thin layer petroleum jelly rub index finger restoration press 20 second . The material include seal pit fissure . After prepare balanced occlusion , new layer petroleum jelly apply GIC restoration . The amount GIC use , element number , cavity dimension dmft record . The duration restorative procedure record stop watch . The participate child instruct eat one hour restoration place . Estimation cost-effectiveness : Effectiveness measure term retention rate . This study report preliminary result 6 month , follow-ups do every 6 month 2 year . The average cost per restoration estimate . Costs equipment , autoclave hand instrument , disposable ( hand glove , face mask , cotton wool roll ) , articulate paper petroleum jelly used restoration equal three GIC group exclude . There labour cost operator . The material cost ( powder-liquid GICs ) estimate per restoration . Evaluation : The retention rate restoration evaluate 6 month accord Frencken Holmgren criterion occlusal surface , modify version Roeleveld et al . ( 2006 ) criteria occlusal-proximal surface ; A restoration consider 'failure ' defect filling , secondary caries observe , restoration present pulp inflame . When restoration still present slight defect observe , consider 'success ' . When tooth unavailable evaluation , censor . All evaluation carry one independent evaluator , restore cavity , train calibrate benchmark . The cost effectiveness evaluate . The total price GIC brand , use insert cavity compare retention rate restoration .</detailed_description>
