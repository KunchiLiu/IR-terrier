	<brief_summary>Continuous femoral nerve block ( CFNB ) provide effective pain control patient undergoing total knee replacement ( TKR ) . However result motor blockade lead decrease quadriceps muscle strength delay functional recovery.The purpose study compare effect Liposome Bupivacaine infiltration knee CFNB pain control functional recovery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Bupivacaine Post Operative Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , active control study patient undergoing total knee replacement . The objective study compare efficacy Liposome Bupivacaine , manage postoperative pain , standard care CFNB . Following informed consent , patient randomize one two group , Liposome Bupivacaine active control , CFNB group . 266 mg Liposome Bupivacaine plus Bupivicaine HCL ( 150mg ) administer via local joint infiltration around knee joint prior wound closure . In control group CFNB place 48hrs prior surgery . Outcomes measure include pain rest , movement quadriceps muscle strength first second postoperative day . It hypothesize Liposome Bupivacaine provide effective pain control improve preservation quadriceps muscle strength , comparison CFNB .</detailed_description>
