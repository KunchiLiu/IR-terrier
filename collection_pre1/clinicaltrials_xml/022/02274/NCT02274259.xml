	<brief_title>Comparing Injection Frequency Between Aflibercept Ranibizumab Patients With CRVO With Treat &amp; Extend Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty patient diagnose new central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) maximum duration 6 month recruit study . Patients randomize 1:1 treatment aflibercept ot ranibizumab . patient receive 3 initial monthly injection . There injection give att every visit accord treat extend schedule . If macular edema see Ocular coherent tomography ( OCT ) examination next treatment 6 week . If macula dry 6 week new injection give next visit schedule another 8 week . If edema see OCT 8 week time next injection reduce 6 week . Patients receive injection often every 4 week . All patient receive injection least every 12 week . Primary outcome : number need injection 18 month period compare ranibizumab aflibercept . Secondary outcome : Change visual acuity , change macular thickness . A subgroup patient also evaluate OCT angiography . A possible relationship Visual acuity foveal avascular zone evaluate .</detailed_description>
