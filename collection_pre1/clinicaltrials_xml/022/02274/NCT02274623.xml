	<brief_title>Effect CTAP101 Capsules Ca/iPTH Advanced Breast/Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Denosumab/Zoledronic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , repeat-dose study evaluate safety , efficacy , tolerability CTAP101 Capsules subject bone metastasis receive ongoing therapy denosumab zoledronic acid . Following screening , approximately 12 eligible subject breast cancer approximately 12 eligible subject prostate cancer , metastases bone undergoing treatment anti-resorptive therapy , receive CTAP101 Capsules initial daily oral dose 30 μg ( 1 capsule ) 4 week . The daily dose may increase 30 μg ( 1 capsule ) increments 4-week interval maximum 300 μg serum calcium reach &gt; 10.3 mg/dL two consecutive visit ( dose escalation phase ) time subject suspend dose serum calcium ≤10.0 mg/dL directly enter 12-week maintenance phase , resume treatment reduce daily dose , follow 2-week follow-up period . Subjects reach maximum dose without serum calcium reach &gt; 10.3 mg/dL , directly enter 12-week maintenance phase , follow 2-week follow-up period . Serum marker monitor bone metabolism ( include plasma iPTH , PTHrP , serum free calcifediol ) , immune function tumor burden measure treatment period . The FACT-BP Quality Life Measurement Patients Bone Pain questionnaire use explore effect treatment , , musculoskeletal pain . The genotype vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) also determine . Safety monitor adverse event , serum urine chemistry , hematology , ECGs .</detailed_description>
