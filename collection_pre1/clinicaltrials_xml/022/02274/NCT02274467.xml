	<brief_summary>Lumbar epidural analgesia commonly use labor pain relief due effectiveness safety . Despite high success rate , epidural technique remain rather blind technique failure continue occur . The correct placement epidural catheter , however , remain clinical problem , since imaging technique could use bedside determine exact position catheter . The technique trans-catheter electric stimulation test ( TCEST ) successfully use detect proper epidural catheter location pediatric , post-operative labor obstetric patient . The response TCEST uniport ( single hole ) epidural catheter well describe . There grow body evidence multiport epidural catheter provide advantage uniport catheter , since additional port likely allow enhance distribution local anesthetic solution . This show result lower incidence inadequate analgesia , include unilateral sensory blockade miss sensory segment . The characteristic TCEST response use multiport catheter remain determined . The aim study compare response pattern TCEST use single port versus multiport wire reinforce epidural catheter . The hypothesis study incidence bilateral response TCEST high multiport catheter compare uniport catheter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize double-blind control study . After recruitment patient , epidural anesthesia perform standard fashion employ investigator institution resident , fellow , staff . Spinal ultrasound use prior perform epidural catheter insertion . Patients randomly allocate two different group receive either 19 gauge uniport catheter 19 gauge multiorifice catheter ( Arrow Flextip plus , Arrow International Inc. , Reading , PA ) . After securement catheter , TCEST perform . The test repeat 5 minute , follow test dose , determine change intensity current require elicit motor response . Following second testing , load dose standard anesthetic solution administer . The sensory level ice test 20 minute follow injection load dose bupivacaine fentanyl . The sensory level assess sacral thoracic level , bilaterally Failure epidural analgesia assess , define evidence sensory block ice absent pain relief . The need catheter replacement determine within 2 hour completion load dose .</detailed_description>
