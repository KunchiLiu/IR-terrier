	<brief_summary>This single arm multi-center pilot trial within Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium ( PNOC ) . The current study use new treatment approach base patient 's tumor genomic profiling consist whole exome sequence RNA sequence well predictive modeling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Profiling Individualized Treatment Plan DIPG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study test whether patient gain clinical benefit treatment approach compare overall survival 12 month ( OS12 ) historical control . Newly diagnose patient receive individualized treatment recommendation include four FDA approve drug base molecular profile patient 's tumor determine gene expression analysis , WES predictive modeling , age patient exist medical condition . Initial therapy consist standard radiation therapy per institutional guideline follow molecular base therapy FDA approve drug .</detailed_description>
