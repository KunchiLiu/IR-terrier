	<brief_summary>The primary purpose provide access thymus tissue transplantation patient immunodeficiency , hematologic malignancy , severe autoimmune disease related poor thymic function . With thymus function , bone marrow stem cell develop T cell , fight infection . Eligible participant undergo thymus transplantation biopsy . Immune suppression may give depend immune status clinical condition participant . Immune function test continue one year post-transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Protocol Thymus Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant enrol high likelihood death receive thymus transplant lack thymus function . As many type patient may enrol , study result statistical significance . The study objective make thymus transplantation available expanded access basis . Data collect survival , naïve T cell development , T cell chimerism , transplant related toxicity , well unexpected study relate serious adverse event . Participants undergo thymus transplantation allograft biopsy . Immune suppression may give depend immune status clinical condition . Protocol specify study continue approximately one year post-transplantation . Study participation last two year .</detailed_description>

Each participant review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease Uncontrolled infection . `` Uncontrolled '' define require ventilator , dialysis , vasopressor support anticipate require support within 6 month . Pregnancy For female childbearing potential , serum pregnancy test do consent , time another blood draw do possible . Females childbearing potential must agree contraceptive measure indicate consent form . A second serum pregnancy test do within 48 hour prior administration study intervention involve FDA pregnancy class D drug , chemotherapy drug , drug intervention know pose risk potential fetus .
