	<brief_summary>Currently , majority lymphomas cured standard chemo-radiotherapy . Cluster differentiation antigen 30 ( CD30 ) express many lymphoma subtypes , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . CD30 represent attractive target chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -based immune cell therapy . This study evaluate novel 4th generation CD30 CAR engineer self-withdrawal mechanism ( FKBP-iCasp9 ) efficacy safety evaluation lymphoma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cells Targeting CD30 Positive Lymphomas ( 4SCAR30273 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number lymphoma patient exhaust current treatment option die disease . Innovative therapy urgently need . Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -modified T cell demonstrate unprecedented success treat even late stage cluster differentiation antigen 19 ( CD19 ) positive B cell malignancy . Besides CD19 lymphoma , many lymphomas CD30 positive therefore , CD30-CAR T cell may prove effective treating patient . We develop several generation CD30 CARs . Preclinical study demonstrate effective kill CD30 target cell . In study , two version CD30 CARs , 4th generation CARs self-withdrawal mechanism ( FKBP-iCasp9 ) , evaluate CD30 lymphoma patient . The primary goal safety assessment include cytokine storm response adverse effect . In addition , tumor target disease status treatment also evaluate .</detailed_description>
