	<brief_summary>The purpose study find novel drug approve Food Drug Administration [ Duavee™ , Pfizer , Inc ] treatment postmenopausal symptom ( vaginal dryness hot flash ) prevention osteoporosis also improve insulin sensitivity decrease body fat especially liver . DUAVEE™ ( Conjugated Estrogens/Bazedoxifene ) new prescription medicine contain mixture estrogen ( main female hormone make ovary ) bazedoxifene , FDA approve . For 60 year , estrogen use hormonal treatment help manage hot flash help prevent postmenopausal bone loss . But treatment postmenopausal woman , use estrogens alone increase risk develop cancer uterus . So estrogens traditionally pair progestin decrease risk hyperplasia ( thicken line uterus ) , precursor cancer . DUAVEE™ use bazedoxifene , selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , place progestin help protect uterus thicken uterus may result estrogen alone . In study , get either DUAVEE™ placebo ( `` dummy pill '' may look like medicine contains active medication ) first switch pill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve screen process see eligible participate follow two 8-week treatment period separate 8-week washout period . The two 8-week treatment : 1 . 8 week treatment TSEC ( Duavee™ , combination CE BZA ) 2 . 8 week treatment `` dummy pill '' ( Placebo ) The order 2 8-week treatment period decide chance ( coin flip ) . STUDY VISITS ( 11 VISITS total ) If participate study , referral Baton Rouge General Obstetrics Gynecology Physicians , complete 1 screen visit Pennington Biomedical Research Center determine eligibility . If eligible enrol study , complete additional 10 visit ( 8 brief visit 2 overnight inpatient stay ) . Please note time provide procedure total time clinic visit approximation may vary depend circumstance . SCREENING VISIT ( 1 visit , approximately 1.5 hour , fast ) : Please drink food water 10 hour appointment . Participants ask report Pennington clinic fasting . After detailed explanation whole study coordinator , agree procedure sign consent form , : 1 . Your height body weight measure . 2 . You ECG ( electrocardiogram ) measure heart rate rhythm . 3 . Your blood pressure measure . 4 . A blood sample ( &lt; 1 teaspoon ) urine collect assess general health . 5 . You medical history physical examination . If fully eligible accord data collect screen visit , call set second visit provide medication dummy pill . VISIT 2 ( 30 minute ) : You come Pennington pick drug supply ( real medication dummy pill ) meet nurse study coordinator give instruction take pill day . VISITS 3-5 ( 30 minute ) : At week 1 , 3 , 5 8-week treatment period , come outpatient clinic measure weight , blood pressure pulse , collect feedback health check medication compliance well distribute new medication . VISIT 6 ( 24 hour inpatient unit ) : You admit inpatient unit 4pm ( fast ) measure : 1 . Total body fat DXA 2 . Abdominal visceral fat Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) 3 . Fat liver muscle Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) You receive standard dinner ~7pm ask switch light bedroom ~10pm The next morning investigator wake ~4.45am start IV line start 8-hour procedure ( Euglycemic Clamp ) measure body respond insulin . You discharge inpatient unit 2 3 pm feed lunch . Visit 1 Screening ; Visit 2/7 Wk0/17 ; Visit 3/8 Wk1/18 ; Visit 4/9 Wk3/20 ; Visit 5/10 Wk5/22 Visit 6/11 Wk8/25 ECG : Screening Vital Signs , Height , Weight , Waist &amp; Hip Measurements : Screening , Visit 3 , Visit 4 , Visit 5 &amp; Visit 6 Fasting Blood &amp; Urine Sample : Screening Visit 6 Medical History &amp; Physical Exam + Questionnaire Barriers : Screening Pick pills/receive instruction : Visit 2 , Visit 3 , Visit 4 , &amp; Visit 5 Health Status/Medication Compliance Visit 3 , Visit 4 &amp; Visit 5 Admittance Inpatient Unit : Visit 6 Body Composition ( DXA ) : Visit 6 Body Composition ( MRI ) : Visit 6 Liver/Muscle Fat ( MRS ) : Visit 6 Euglycemic Clamp biopsy : Visit 6 Eight week later ( take pill ) , start sequence visit ( VISITS 7-11 ) show Visits 2-6 time pill . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES Euglycemic IV clamp ( 8 hour ) : This procedure measure body responds insulin . Insulin normally produce body meal help body use sugar . There 2 IV line , one arm one hand opposite side . Approximately 30 minute IV line insert ; investigator perform fat biopsy sample fat cell beneath skin stomach area . Then , muscle biopsy obtain sample muscle cell beneath skin thigh . Small amount glucose insulin infuse arm . Your blood sugar level check every 5-10 minute IV hand determine much glucose keep blood sugar normal level . Your hand place inside warm box increase skin temperature 105 degree Fahrenheit . The temperature warm , uncomfortable . During IV procedure , small amount blood ( le 1 teaspoon ) immediately return vein IV specimen collect Three time 8-hour procedure , investigator place clear plastic hood , fresh air flow , head measure many calorie body burn . This measure last 40 minute time . Your urine collect throughout test urine jug ( end test 2 collection necessary ) . Fat biopsy ( 30 minute ) : This procedure use sample fat cell underneath abdominal skin cleanse skin iodine use local anesthetic . After cleanse area , doctor Nurse Practitioner make small incision skin introduce needle skin remove fat cell . About 1 gram ( less half teaspoon size ) fat remove . After biopsy complete , skin hold close sterile adhesive bandage ; antibiotic ointment apply . Risks : Fat Biopsy : Mild severe pain , soreness , bruising , small scar common risk . There small risk hematoma ( collection blood tissue ) infection biopsy site . Sterile technique use minimize risk biopsy site monitor closely . Muscle Biopsy ( 30 minute ) : This procedure use sample muscle cell underneath skin leg . After clean skin iodine use local anesthetic , doctor nurse practitioner make small incision skin introduce needle skin remove muscle cell . About 200-750 milligram ( less teaspoon size ) muscle remove . After biopsy complete , skin hold close sterile adhesive bandage antibiotic ointment apply . Risks : Muscle Biopsy : Mild severe pain , soreness , bruising , small scar common risk . A hematoma ( collection blood tissue ) may occur . There slight risk superficial nerve may cut ; nerve may heal , may result permanent loss sensation skin biopsy site . DXA - Whole Body Scan ( ~4 minute ) : This scan measure amount bone , muscle , fat body . The scan perform use whole-body scanner . You require wear hospital gown , remove metal-containing object body , lie table . A scanner emit low energy X-rays detector pas along body . You ask remain completely still scan progress . The scan take less four minute . This scan research purpose diagnostic treatment . MRI Abdomen ( 30 minute ) : This scan measure amount fat abdomen . You change hospital gown remove object contain metal body . You lie back scanner table arm head . A large coil place around upper abdomen . You move magnet instruct hold breath 4-5 time ( six second , 13 second , 2-3 time 18 second upper abdominal scan complete , move table , coil place low abdomen . The scan acquire area 4-5 breath hold . The total scan time procedure approximately 30 minute . During scan , hear loud tapping noise . You give headphone protection scanner noise listen music scan desire . You also give call button need MRI Technician exam . This scan research purpose diagnostic treatment . MRS IHL ( Intrahepatic lipid ) ( 20-30 minute ) : This scan measure amount fat liver . You change hospital gown remove object contain metal body . You place scanner table head first stomach . The table move magnet data obtain . The scan last approximately 20-30 minute . During scan , hear loud tapping noise . You give head phone protection scanner noise listen music scan desire . You also give call button need MRI tech exam . This scan research purpose diagnostic treatment . MRS IMCL ( Intramyocellular lipid ) ( 60 minute ) : This scan measure amount fat muscle fiber . You change hospital gown remove object contain metal body . You lie back scanner table right leg special coil . The top part coil place calf . Cushions insert around calf help keep leg still possible . The table move scanner series several scan obtain . The entire procedure last approximately 60 minute . During scan , hear loud tapping noise . You give head phone protection scanner noise listen music scan desire . You also give call button need MRI tech exam . This scan research purpose diagnostic treatment .</detailed_description>
