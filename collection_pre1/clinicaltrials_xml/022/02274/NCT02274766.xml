	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-arm , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety ADS-5102 extend release ( ER ) capsule , investigational formulation amantadine , dose nightly bedtime treatment levodopa-induced dyskinesia ( LID ) subject Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The novel pharmacokinetic profile ADS-5102 expect achieve ) maximal concentration early morning mid-day , LID troublesome , ii ) low concentration even , potentially reduce negative impact amantadine sleep . This pharmacokinetic profile could enable high dos tolerate once-nightly ER formulation tolerate immediate-release formulation . The once-nightly dosing regimen may also provide enhance convenience compliance . In previous clinical study , ADS-5102 meet primary endpoint ; LID significantly reduce measured change UDysRS score 8 week vs. placebo .</brief_summary>
