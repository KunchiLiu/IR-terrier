	<brief_summary>AC0010 Maleate Capsules new , irreversible , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.Aim local advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patient EGFR mutation T790M drug-resistant mutation . The molecular mechanism : irreversible combine EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site cell , selectively suppress activity EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation , block sigal signal transduction system EGFR , close function ras/raf/MAPK downstream . last block tumor cell growth EGFR induction , promote apoptosis . AC0010 Maleate Capsules three character : 1 . Irreversible combination EGFR ; 2.Efficient suppress EGFR mutant tumor cell suppression EGFR wild-type cell ; 3 . Efficient suppress EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study treat patient advance NSCLC already receive least one course specific anti-cancer treatment tumor start re-grow following treatment . This first time drug use tested patient , help understand type side effect may occur drug treatment , measure level drug body , also measure anti-cancer activity . By use piece information together best dose drug use clinical trial select . This study multicenter , open-label , two-stage phase I clinical trial . Trial include single-dose successive-dose tolerance research , single-dose successive-dose pharmacokinetic research , food bioavailability study , exploration different dose method tentative evaluation clinical efficacy . Stage one dose escalation study , use modify Fibonacci method . 7 dose level set , respectively 50mg/d 100mg/d 200mg/d 350mg/d 550mg/d 850mg/d 1100mg/d . Three patient enrol dose level , observed indicator dose-limited toxicity . No DLT occur 3 patient , dose escalate next level . 1/3 DLT observe , 3 patient enrolled level , DLT observe , dose escalate next level , DLT occur , escalation stop . 2/3 DLT observe , escalation stop . A recommend phase II dose level acquire method . Stage two multicenter , open label , one arm successive dose clinical trial , base dose level method acquire stage one , safety evaluation tentative evaluation clinical efficacy .</detailed_description>
