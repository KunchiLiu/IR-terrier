	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) lead cause maternal morbidity mortality worldwide cause commonly poor uterine muscle tone delivery . The first line agent use prevention treatment PPH oxytocin , act bind oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) find myometrial cell cause uterine contraction . It increase level calcium within myometrial cell , promote contraction . Women require augmentation labor intravenous oxytocin inadequate labor progression show increase risk PPH . In-vitro human myometrial model show follow prolonged exposure oxytocin desensitization myometrium result significant reduction contractility upon delivery oxytocin . Optimal level calcium important contraction uterine muscle . Too little calcium result reduce contraction . Too much calcium may result either strong contraction , even possibly relaxation muscle therefore reduce contraction . The investigator currently know effect calcium desensitize uterine muscle . The investigator hypothesize myometrial contractility follow desensitization myometrium would reduce myometrial sample expose low calcium , compare normal calcium high calcium exposure . These result help establish whether myometrial contraction augment increase calcium level within body , optimize normal physiological calcium level , set augment prolonged labor , high risk poor uterine contraction PPH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The increase incidence uterine atony PPH follow exogenous oxytocin administration labor augmentation relate myometrial OTR desensitization oxytocin . Calcium important messenger require within uterine muscle cell result muscle contraction follow administration oxytocin . A physiological level calcium know provide optimal contractility normal myometrium . Characterization importance low , normal high calcium level set prolong exogenous oxytocin administration may provide guidance use exogenous calcium uterotonic adjunct ; optimization serum calcium level augment labor . In clinical setting fail labor augmentation OTR desensitization , role serum calcium level currently know . The investigator ' previously validate in-vitro model provide solid foundation study myometrial contractility control condition , without confounders could encounter clinical setting . The result study provide insight effect low , normal high calcium level oxytocin pretreated ( desensitize ) non-pretreated myometrium . Based oxytocin dose-response curve pretreatment oxytocin subsequent exposure either low , normal high level calcium , investigator able determine role calcium desensitize myometrium .</detailed_description>
