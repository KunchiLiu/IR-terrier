	<brief_title>Bayston Multicenter Antimicrobial PD Catheter Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective clinical investigation establish safety Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter ESRD patient initiate CAPD . The Bayston catheter expect cause safety relate complication reaction describe not-impregnated peritoneal dialysis catheter . Thus objective clinical investigation evaluate whether Bayston catheter cause unanticipated serious adverse device effect ( USADE ) . The primary hypothesis study Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter safe catheter peritoneal dialysis . No claim regard efficacy verify clinical investigation . This prospective , non-randomized , single-arm , multi-center study involve patient suffer end stage renal disease eligible treatment peritoneal dialysis . Forty-three ( 43 ) patient enrol follow 6 month implantation Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter .</detailed_description>
