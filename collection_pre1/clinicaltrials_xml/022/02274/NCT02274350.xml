	<brief_title>The Herlev Hospital Post Radiation Therapy Localized Prostate Cancer Database Sexual Side Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : According European Association Urology guideline radical prostatectomy ( RP ) external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) consider equal treatment curative intend , localized prostate cancer [ 1 ] . Another type radiation therapy use treat localized prostate cancer brachytherapy ( BT ) . After RP EBRT patient suffer degree erectile dysfunction ( ED ) urinary incontinence ( UI ) [ 2-5 ] . However , current evidence show rate low EBRT [ 4,5 ] . Unfortunately , EBRT hold potential late-onset toxicity , small percentage patient , lead secondary genitourinary gastrointestinal cancer [ 5 ] . In recent study RP patient Herlev hospital , investigator find many patient , addition ED UI , also suffer UI sexual activity , Orgasmic dysfunction , penile morphological sensory change [ 6 ] . Only study investigate side effect EBRT BT patient . The aim study therefore : - To investigate sexual side effect occur EBRT BT - To investigate many patient affect - To investigate time dependency severity sexual side effect - To investigate dose dependency severity sexual side effect - To find predicting associated factor discover sexual side effect help identify patient risk Background : As mention , study investigate sexual side effect aside ED EBRT patient . O'Neil et al find 110 EBRT patient 5.2 % report orgasm associate UI ; , 28.3 % 279 RP patient query report problem [ 7 ] . Penile shorten consistently find RP [ 8 ] . However , brachytherapy ERBT conjunction androgen deprivation therapy penile shorten also describe [ 9 ] . Sullivan et al . investigated ejaculatory profile en men undergo radiation therapy ( RT ) , either EBRT , brachytherapy , combination [ 10 ] . They find 5 year RT 89 % patient report anejaculation . During 5 year follow patient report increasingly bad score , measure orgasm domain international index erectile function ( IIEF ) . Research plan , participant , method : Because apparent shortage study main aim investigate sexual side effect ED EBRT BT , investigator want conduct single center cross-sectional questionnaire base study comparable study RP side effect [ 6 ] . The investigator hope document many patient affect UI sexual stimulation , alter perception orgasm , anejaculation , orgasm-associated pain , penile shortening , alter penile curvature , penile sensory change . Furthermore want identify predicting associate factor well understand side effect occur . The study start September 2014 investigator anticipate complete data collection December 2014 . Initially investigator plan invite 20 patient participate interview session give opportunity contribute design questionnaire . When final questionnaire ready suit patient receive questionnaire mail . Initial non-responders receive another questionnaire 4-6 week later order get many answer possible . In order grant u permission search patientsÂ´ journal background information patient receive inform consent formula sign . Recruiting patient inform consent : Patients identify hospital record . Initially 10 EBRT patient 10 BT patient contact telephone order arrange interview session . The remain patient contacted mail describe . Patients inform purpose study final publication study result keep anonymous . Patients ask state accept publication . The initial questionnaire accompany letter explain importance participate . One month questionnaire expect received patient reminder send non-responders . Publication result : The final result publish peer review international journal soon possible . Should possible result make public hospital internet homepage . Prevalence rate main outcome ; Univariate multivariate logistic regression analysis use purpose identifying associate predict factor . Ethics : The study carry accord rule state declaration Helsinki Danish law concern health care research . The study approve Danish data protection agency register clinicaltrials.org . Hopefully study help add valuable knowledge area largely undiscovered . In addition , investigator expect result help draw clear picture pro con RP , BT , EBRT treatment localized prostate cancer . Finally , study help patient suffer sexual side effect EBRT make practitioner aware existence provide knowledge well inform future patient .</detailed_description>
