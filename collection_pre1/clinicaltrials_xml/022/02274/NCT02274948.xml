	<brief_summary>This study expect evaluate use metformin management obese child . Insulin resistance among obese Sri Lankan child ( south Asian origin ) high , show investigator previous work . This study look effect metformin change insulin resistance , fatty liver state , body fat content , BMI metabolic derangement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Metformin Treatment Childhood Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . General objective To study prevalence Non Communicable Disease ( NCD ) relate metabolic derangement among obese child assess outcome two different management ( metformin v placebo alongside dietary physical activity change ) modality among 8 to16 year old obese child live Negombo educational division Negambo educational zone Gampaha district Sri Lanka . 1.1 Specific objective 1 . To study prevalence obesity relate metabolic derangement among obese child . 2 . To compare effectiveness use metformin v placebo change fat content BMI among obese child . 3 . To compare effectiveness use metformin v placebo reversal insulin resistance metabolic derangement among obese child . 2 Methods 2.1 Study design A double blind randomize prospective placebo control study 2.2 Subjects Study set Obese ( +2 Standard Deviation ( SD ) BMI age World Health Organization ( WHO ) standard ) school child Negombo educational zone district Gampaha . Obese child identify separate screening programme ( carry Sep-Dec 2013 Sri Lanka College Paediatricians , ethical review committee approve study protocol ) carry educational division invite participate study . Children Sri Lankan origin plan live Sri Lanka next one year secondary underlying cause overweight/obesity , exclude . Parents inform importance participate study point receive treatment well participate research ( write information sheet give ) inform write consent parents/guardians assent child obtain . Any parent , child wish participate allow . 2.3 Sample size sample method : All child detect obese previous screen programme invite minimum sample size 120 child recruit . The sample size calculate , among obese child , total sample size 60 participant would detect between-group difference 0.09 BMI SD score unit ( approximately equivalent 2 kg/m2 difference ) 80 % power . Participant accrual set 120 participant allow much 50 percent loss follow-up . However , investigator take maximum effort trace patient . 2.4 Measurements : These child invite participate follow programme part clinical service well research . Their parent inform bring child Loins Club Negambo Host , Diabetes Screening Vocational Training Centre , Negambo appointment . Measurements do Loins Club Negambo Host , Diabetes Screening Vocational Training Centre , Negamboafter overnight fast . Height , weight , waist circumference hip circumference measure . Percentage fat mass measure use Bio Electrical Impedance ( BIA ) assay use platform type InBody 230 instrument ( InBody® , Biospace , South Korea ) . Once impedance value measure , total body water calculate use locally validate BIA prediction equation ( Wickramasinghe et al 2008 ) . From Total Body Water ( TBW ) , Fat Free Mass ( FFM ) hence Fat Mass ( FM ) calculate use age gender specific water content FFM ( Lohman , 1989 ) . Blood pressure measure use mercury sphygmomanometer seat position 10-15 minute rest . Male female child assess trained male female investigator respectively . Metabolic derangement assess mean : total cholesterol , LDL-C level , HDL-C level , triglyceride , insulin , Alanine amino transferase ( ALT ) Aspartate amino transferase ( AST ) ( 8ml blood plain bottle ) fast blood sugar ( 2ml blood NaF contain bottle ) . Oral Glucose Toerance Test ( OGTT ) test do give anhydrous glucose 1.75g ( 1.92g monohydrous glucose ) max 75g ( max 82.5g monohydrous glucose ) blood take 2 hour later random blood sugar ( 2ml blood NaF contain bottle ) serum insulin ( 2ml blood plain bottle ) . Serum separate immediately store -20 degree Celcius analysis do Loins Club Negambo Host , Diabetes Screening Vocational Training Centre , Negambo batch . Blood drawn apply lignocaine ( Emla® ) anesthetic cream . Insulin resistance calculate use Homeostatic model Insulin Resistance ( HOMA-IR= fast blood sugar × fast insulin ÷ 22.5 ) ( Matthews et al 1985 ) . An Ultra sound scan abdomen do identify hepatic steatosis consultant radiologist . Pubertal staging assess use visual chart ( Morris Udry 1980 ) . Girls show diagram depict different stage growth breast pubic hair ask match ( whenever necessary seek mother 's assistance ) . Similarly boys show diagrams external genitalia pubic hair match . The size testis measure examiner use Prader orchidometer . If subject parent sure staging , consent , examiner would examine correct pubertal stage assessment would make . Measurements examination girl boy carry female male investigator respectively . The whole project closely supervise two Consultant paediatrician completion study child need follow provide service wish follow different institute , would refer complete report . 2.5 Randomization : Once obesity overweight diagnose investigate , randomly assign either one management protocol 1:1 basis . Children categorize accord gender age group ; 8-10.99 ; 11-13.99 ; 14-16 year . Using grid age sex , sequentially allocate receive management protocol I II . Only field investigator information allocation . That ; Group I Structured diet + Physical activity+ Metformin Group II Structured diet + Physical activity + Placebo Dietary advice give trained nutritionist . It base food base dietary guideline produce Ministry Health ( Jayatissa Wickramasinghe , 2011 ) . Age base portion size guide give parent child guide volume eat . Physical activity training conduct qualified physical activity instructor . A daily physical activity routine 20-30 minute give student . The programme would 3 different type base age ( 11-13 14-16 . The workout programme change every month order break monotony . There 4 different workout schedule . Medication : 8-10.99 year old child receive metformin . Initially child give 250mg metformin daily week increase 250mg twice daily week 500 mg twice daily . 11-16 year old child receive 500mg metformin daily initially one week increase 500mg twice daily week 1g twice daily . Children ask take medication morning evening meal reduce gastro intestinal side effect risk hypoglycaemia . Response medication evaluate dose revision monitor possible adverse event . The study monitor Data Safety Monitoring Committee comprise Paediatrician , Paediatric Endocrinologist Bio- Statistician . Both nutritionist physical trainer blind medication child receive . A control group treatment employ unethical intervention diagnosis obesity make . A placebo give overcome psychological effect give medication . metformin Placebo manufacture State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company ( SPMC ) . The placebo tablet similar metformin aspect except contain active pharmacological compound . These child review two week commencement therapy dose revise thereafter monthly order ensure compliance identify adverse event address issue . In additionally contact via telephone , weekly first month fortnightly afterwards address concerns/issues also motivate keep compliance high level . At visit , anthropometry body composition assess , blood investigation repeat 6 12 month . At eveluations , one one meeting hold . 2.6 Statistics The distribution metabolic derangement describe use descriptive statistic . Spearman Correlation Coefficients use ass relationship percentage fat metabolic derangement relate NCD well anthropometric measurement metabolic derangement . Comparisons mean value measurement make use test .</detailed_description>
