	<brief_title>Myoelectric SoftHand Pro Improve Prosthetic Function People With Below-elbow Amputations : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary data suggest SoftHand Pro ( SHpro ) extremely versatile use grasp manipulate common object . We perform extensive test myoelectric SHpro ask subject perform wide variety ADL task structure environment onsite Mayo Clinic Rochester . These data use Mayo Clinic , ASU , IIT research team modify SHpro design adapt use people amputation focus SHpro socket design , surface electromyography ( EMG ) -based control ( typically use commercially available prosthesis today ) . We quantify ability patient below-elbow amputation perform task use prosthetic terminal device version SHpro . We hypothesize people amputation learn use SHpro perform grasp manipulation task great level allow current terminal device . The long-term objective exploratory study design build low-cost , high-performance prosthetic hand terminal device accept patient below-elbow amputation allow perform wider range ADL task allow today 's commercially available prosthesis . The data collect proposed study provide important foundation optimize design SHpro future test large number people limb loss . Future study also assess extent SHpro 's functionality acceptance might benefit embed additional synergistic hand motion pattern SHpro .</detailed_description>
