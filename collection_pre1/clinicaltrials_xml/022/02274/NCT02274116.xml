	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine nervous system control leg muscle alter follow spinal cord injury may affect brief period low oxygen inhalation time . The investigator hypothesize : - Acute intermittent hypoxia ( AIH ) exposure increase maximum voluntary leg strength person incomplete cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) - AIH exposure increase multijoint reflex excitability leg muscle person incomplete cervical SCI - AIH exposure increase walk performance person incomplete cervical SCI</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence suggest repeatedly breathe low oxygen level brief period ( termed intermittent hypoxia ) safe effective treatment strategy promote meaningful functional recovery person chronic spinal cord injury . Repetitive exposure mild hypoxia trigger cascade event spinal cord , include new protein synthesis increase sensitivity circuitry necessary breathing walking . Recently , investigator demonstrate daily ( 5 consecutive day ) intermittent hypoxia stimulate walk enhancement person chronic spinal cord injury . Despite exciting finding , important clinical question remain . For example , investigator know prolong , less intense intermittent hypoxia induce longer-lasting motor recovery show rat model . The investigator hypothesize repetitive exposure ( 3 time per week 4 week ) modest bout low oxygen enhance prolong walk recovery person chronic spinal cord injury . The investigator anticipate intermittent hypoxia-induced improvement overground walk ability , likely due great balance excitatory inhibitory neural transmission . Whereas excitatory input drive walking , inhibitory input sculpt coordinate muscle activity ; yet often remain compromised chronic injury . Thus , investigator also predict repetitive exposure intermittent hypoxia result improve inhibition subsequently enhance muscle coordination walking . The investigator use multiple experimental approach , include muscle electromyography , measurement walk dynamic stretch reflex . Finally , critical assure repetitive exposure intermittent hypoxia elicit pathology characteristic severe , chronic hypoxia experience individual obstructive sleep apnea . The investigator confirm repeat exposure mild bout intermittent hypoxia safe .</detailed_description>
