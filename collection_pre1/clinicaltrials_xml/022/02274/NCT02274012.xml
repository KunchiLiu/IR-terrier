	<brief_summary>The investigator research program find investigational drug , afatinib medication know block function ErbB2 protein might help standard chemotherapy , particular paclitaxel , work well . Afatinib ( GILOTRIF ) highly potent , irreversible inhibitor EGFR HER2 . On July 12 , 2013 United States Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) approve afatinib first-line treatment patient metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor specific EGFR gene mutation ( exon 19 deletion exon 21 i.e . L858R substitution mutation ) detect FDA approve test . Paclitaxel standard , anti-cancer medicine approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment lung cancer . The combination Afatinib Paclitaxel consider investigational used research program . An investigational drug drug approve FDA indication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Afatinib Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel Second Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard Procedures : Subjects offer second line chemotherapy paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle disease progression intolerable toxicity . Experimental Procedures : In addition standard chemotherapy , afatinib 40 mg orally daily administer start first day paclitaxel . Translational study ass circulate tumor cell start therapy several later time point , include time progression . These study assess correlation circulate tumor cell number radiographic response pilot study also conduct assess HER2 expression , HER2 genomic amplification , HER2 pathway activation secondary genetic change HER2 cod sequence well pathway component .</detailed_description>
