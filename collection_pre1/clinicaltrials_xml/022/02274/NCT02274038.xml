	<brief_title>Serial 18FThymidine ( FLT ) PET/CT Biomarker Response Pemetrexed Therapy Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We test hypothesis positron emission tomography ( PET ) image image agent 18F-thymidine ( FLT ) rapidly assess treatment response patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . In particular , hypothesize FLT-PET image offer potential rapidly triaging therapy efficacy within hour day follow start therapy start non-invasively monitor metabolic change tumor , rather conventional approach wait month tumor grow shrink compute tomography ( CT ) . We propose two approach evaluate potential FLT-PET assessment response therapy NSCLC . In first , exploit specific effect ( FLT `` flare '' ) induce pemetrexed , first-line chemotherapy non-squamous NSCLC , evaluate utility FLT-PET ass successful response pemetrexed ( PEM ) therapy within 24 hour . In second approach , utilize FLT marker cell proliferation , do cancer , determine whether chemotherapy produce decrease tumor growth 2 week start therapy . Since approximately 70 % patient fail PEM-based therapy , image technique could reliably detect PEM efficacy hour day rather month would save valuable time allow switch effective therapy .</detailed_description>
