	<brief_title>Robotic Harvest Latissimus Dorsi ( LD ) Muscles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If find eligible take part study , agree , screen , reconstructive surgery , follow-up appointment schedule multiple visit , list consent form . All procedure perform day standard care procedure would already perform . If determine eligible , follow perform surgery : - The study doctor member research team review medical information ask question medical history demographic information . - You physical exam . - You evaluate Physical Therapist test range motion strength . - You complete questionnaire pain , well shoulder , arm , hand range motion . This information use compare result surgery . This take 5 minute complete . - Photographs and/or video surgical site take . - If become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . To take part study , must pregnant . Surgery Study Visit ( 2 ) : At visit , reconstructive surgery perform use robot , call Da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System . The reconstructive surgery consider standard care . You ask sign separate consent form discuss possible benefit risk standard care surgical procedure detail , include information anesthetic give surgery . A standard muscle harvest procedure take 2 hour . A muscle harvest procedure robotic system expect take longer standard surgery . The total procedure time vary patient depend type muscle harvest procedure factor operate room . The total time complete muscle harvest reconstruction take 4 hour . Photographs and/or video surgical site take . You remain hospital 3-4 day surgery complete observation . After discharged hospital , need return within 2 week first follow-up examination . Follow-Up Study Visits ( 3-6 ) : After discharge hospital , 4 follow-up visit . The first follow visit take place within two week discharge . The second follow-up visit 2-4 week , third follow visit 1-3 month fourth follow 3-6 month discharge . The following test procedure perform follow-up visit : - The study doctor check surgery site ( ) . - Your overall health status check . - You evaluate Physical Therapist test range motion strength . - Photographs and/or video surgical site may take . - You complete questionnaire pain shoulder , arm , hand range motion . This information use compare result surgery . Length Study Participation : Your participation study follow-up visit . This investigational study . The use Da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System surgery thorax ( part upper body ) FDA approve commercially available time . However , system FDA clear specifically use latissimus dorsi muscle harvest procedure . The use DaVinci Robotic Surgical System type reconstructive surgery perform live human researcher investigate study . Up 15 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
