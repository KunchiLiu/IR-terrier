Medication adherence especially critical region like rural Alabama , resident among bad health outcome US . Rates cardiovascular mortality , diabetes obesity high , resource scarce area 's predominately black resident deep-seated mistrust healthcare system ( region include Tuskegee , site infamous syphilis study ) . This project design collaboration community member partner build 5-year partnership community-engaged research diabetes peer coach intervention experience peer storytelling . The investigator test hypothesis intervention design within Corbin Strauss framework improve adherence health outcome compare usual care . Our Aims : Aim 1 : With community partner , use qualitative research method , build already develop culturally tailor education material develop medication adherence intervention .

Aim 2 : Conduct randomize control trial 500 individual type 2 diabetes medication nonadherence . The trial compare effect usual care intervention medication adherence physiologic risk factor include A1c , blood pressure low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( primary outcome ) , quality life self-efficacy ( secondary outcome ) . This innovative approach would major shift patient help resourced area live chronic disease commit take medication , improve health eventually reduce health disparity .</detailed_description>
