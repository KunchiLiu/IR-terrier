	<brief_summary>This study kinetin , nutritional supplement corrects mRNA splice defect patient familial dysautonomia ( FD , also know Riley Day syndrome hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type III ) . FD rare fatal autosomal recessive disease growth development selective neuronal population impair . The disease result point mutation gene sequence encodes kinase complex associate protein ( IKAP ) chromosome 9q31 . The mutation , start non-encoding intron 20 , weaken splice site , cause spliceosome wrongly join together exon 19 21 transcribe mRNA strand miss exon 20 . The mutated mRNA produce short unstable IKAP protein quickly degrade . Interestingly , mutation lead complete loss function . Instead , result tissue specific deficiency splice efficiency normal ( wild type ) mutant IKAP mRNA express different ratio different tissue . Some cell , like fibroblast , produce mostly normal mRNA protein , others , like neuron , produce mostly mutant mRNA almost functional protein product .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Tolerability Kinetin , Patients With Familial Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial dysautonomia ( FD , also call Riley Day syndrome hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type III ) autosomal recessive disease cause point mutation kinase complex associate protein ( IKAP ) gene sequence ( 1 , 2 ) . This lead tissue specific splice defect variable `` skip '' exon 20 ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . The consequence devastate congenital sensory neuropathy , affect pain temperature perception ( 5 ) well afferent information viscera ( 6 ) . As result , patient suffer recurrent aspiration pneumonia , respiratory insufficiency , proprioceptive ataxia , scoliosis long-term consequence volatile blood pressure include renal failure ( 7 ) leave ventricular hypertrophy ( 8 ) . In-vitro study show plant hormone kinetin corrects splice defect increase production normal IKAP protein level FD derive cell line ( 9 , 10 ) . Preliminary study heterozygous carrier IKAP mutation show dietary supplementation kinetin increase production correctly splice IKAP mRNA , white blood cell ( 11 ) . Preliminary study patient FD demonstrate kinetin also increase expression correctly splice IKAP mRNA extract white blood cell . However , effect kinetin mRNA level neuronal tissue unknown . The overall objective study assess safety tolerability administer kinetin patient FD . The specific aim proposal determine safety daily dose kinetin patient FD use dose ascend titration determine long-term safety tolerability 3-years receive maximum tolerate steady state dose kinetin . The investigator hope also demonstrate early proof concept kinetin enhance ability neuronal tissue correctly splice IKAP mRNA .</detailed_description>
