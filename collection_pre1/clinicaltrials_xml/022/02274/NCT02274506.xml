	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn researcher successfully safely give patient stem cell transplant infusion white blood cell ( call T-cells ) collect unrelated person , genetically change . The process change DNA ( genetic material ) T-cells call `` gene transfer . '' The gene transfer involve draw blood unrelated donor , separate T cell use machine , change cell ' DNA laboratory , return genetically change cell back body . T-cells type white blood cell fight infection . The type gene transfer use study design help T-cells good fight cancer target chemical marker find certain cancer cell . Researchers want learn genetically-changed T-cells help control B-cell leukemia lymphoma stem cell transplant . Researchers want find high tolerable dose T-cells give patient relapse leukemia lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Plan : This study 2 step : chemotherapy gene transfer . The chemotherapy combination study ( fludarabine cyclophosphamide ) give try help T-cells work well . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level T-cells base join study . The first group 3 participant receive low dose T-cells . Each new group receive high dose T-cells group , intolerable side effect see . Up 6 dose level T-cells test . Chemotherapy Gene Transfer : - On Day -8 ( 8 day T-cell infusion ) Day -7 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 4 hour . You receive mesna vein 30 minute every 4 hour low risk bleed bladder . - On Day -6 Day -2 , receive fludarabine 1 time day vein 30 minute . Sometime 2-7 day chemotherapy end , receive T cell infusion vein 15-30 minute . The infusion divide 2 part least 24 hour apart . During infusion , vital sign check . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If doctor think need base status disease , may receive 2 course study therapy give least 6 week apart . Study Tests : You hospital Day -8 2 day stem cell transplant . Every day hospital , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About 1 week T-cell infusion , follow test procedure perform . These test repeat T-cell infusion repeat . - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . - Part blood drawn routine test also use test antibody may develop mouse antibody use gene transfer process . These antibody call human anti-mouse antibody ( HAMA ) . If body become immune protein , may develop HAMA . The result HAMA test use compare sample blood collect transplant complete , make sure develop immune system reaction mouse protein antibody . - You chest x-ray check pneumonia . - You ECG check heart function . Before T-cell infusion 2 time within 24 hour T-cell infusion , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw measure body 's response T cell infusion . Follow-Up : Within 12 hour , 3 day , 1 week , 2 week T-cell infusion , follow test procedure perform . These test repeat T-cell infusion repeat . - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - During physical exam , check possible reaction study therapy , graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD occur donor cell attack cell recipient 's body . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test research look genetically change T-cells count number B-cells ( white blood cell ) non-changed T-cells . Up 3 time first 7 day T-cell infusion , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw measure body 's response T cell infusion . Every 2 week first month , 1 time month 1 year T-cell infusion , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn test immune system . At 6 week , 1 , 2 , 3 month T-cell infusion : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You check possible reaction study therapy , GVHD . - You ask side effect may . At 3 month T-cell infusion , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check HAMA , breathe test check lung function . At least 1 time 3 month T-cell infusion : - You PET-CT scan and/or CT scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , test procedure check health , bone marrow aspiration biopsy . If disease come back side effect occur 12 month T-cell infusion , may ask return additional follow-up visit doctor think need . Length Study : You may receive 3 course study therapy . You longer able receive study therapy disease get bad , infection intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You may withdraw study time , infusion T cell necessarily reversible type product potential long-term survival body . If withdraw study include withdrawal procedure specifically preform protocol long-term follow-up . Please note , long-term follow-up important safety . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , FDA require patient receive gene transfer long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . You ask sign separate consent form ( Protocol 2006-0676 ) long-term follow begin 1 year study end . This investigational study . The chemotherapy drug study commercially available FDA approve treatment B-cell leukemia lymphoma . The gene transfer ( infusion genetically modify T-cells ) commercially available FDA approve . It currently use research purpose . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
