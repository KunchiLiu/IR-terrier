	<brief_title>Cognitive Motor Interference Rehabilitation Persons With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walking cognitive impairment common person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Approximately 85 % person MS report walk major limitation , whereas 65 % experience cognitive dysfunction . Traditionally , walk cognition view unrelated , evidence cognitive-motor interference ( CMI ) . CMI believe stem damage common neural tract . Recent evidence support cognitive-motor interference person MS. For example , evidence walk performance decline perform conjunction simultaneous cognitive task ( i.e. , dual task cost [ DTC ] walk ) decline walk performance great person MS compare healthy control . This elevate cognitive-motor interference walk mainly associate walk performance person MS although cognitive function play role . Cognitive-motor interference mobility task practical clinical importance link decrease community mobility great risk fall clinical population . Despite adverse consequence elevate CMI ambiguity concern prevention rehabilitation strategy cognitive-motor interference individual MS . This study seek examine whether single and/or target dual task rehabilitation beneficial effect CMI individual MS . The result investigation provide foundation future rehabilitation-based randomize control trial seek improve walk cognitive function person MS .</detailed_description>
