	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize trial clarify role enteral nutrition ( EN ) relationship cardiopulmonary bypass-induced inflammation insulin resistance investigate effect two different feed strategy infant follow cardiac surgery . The study 's primary objective determine early high volume feed modifies relationship severity postoperative systemic inflammation insulin resistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Good nutrition important patient surgery . Patients give food tend few infection , good wound healing , possibly discharge quickly intensive care unit hospital . However , best time start feed speed increase unclear . This may particularly true young child undergone heart surgery use heart-lung bypass machine ( bypass surgery ) . Bypass surgery cause inflammation change way body use energy nutrient . Specifically , bypass body become insensitive insulin ( insulin resistant ) , mean cell body n't take sugar blood like suppose , may lead complication surgery . In recent study find inflammation insulin resistance associate many complication child fed . We sure feed changed way body respond surgery doctor choose feed patient already recover well . In general , doctor often hesitate feed patient immediately surgery worry body may ready food although much information prove worry correct . Starting feed early use structure feeding plan may good recovery heart surgery , even vulnerable patient . We therefore design study see start feed early bypass surgery increase quickly usual routine would decrease inflammation insulin resistance . We study child young 6 month age high risk complication bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
