	<brief_title>Does Environmental Factors Affect Accuracy Pre-hospital Non-invasive Temperature Measurement ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study assess impact different environmental factor ability thermistor-based epitympanic thermometer accurately read temperature normothermic individual thereby estimate feasibility reliability austere pre-hospital setting . Healthy volunteer recruit . As reference value core temperature use standard rectal probe ( Mon-a-Therm , General purpose Temperature Probe 12Fr/Ch , Covidien ) attach external monitor . The study field set mountain Hemsedal , Norway . For measure epitympanic temperature use Metraux Thermometer ( Walpoth , Galdikas et al . 1994 ) . The Metraux Thermometer widely use pre-hospital care Norway internationally . The ear-sensor induction anaesthesia insert accord manufacturer specification auditory canal activate . The sensor two tiny soft metal wire cover plastic wrapping integrate soft rubber earplug . The depth measure point pre-set manufacture approximately 10 mm tympanic membrane . The display show epitympanic temperature real-time . The volunteer expose four different scenario . 1 . Ambient air protection head/measuring site . 2 . Ambient air local protection measure site . 3 . Snow ear-canal placing thermometer ( resemble avalanche condition ) . 4 Cold water ear canal ( resemble water immersion/submersion ) . The temperature measure degree Celsius . A baseline establish expose volunteer different environmental factor . After exposure temperature record every 15 second total 10minutes .</detailed_description>
