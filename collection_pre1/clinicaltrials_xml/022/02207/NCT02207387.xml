	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect contingency-based musical walking intervention program call Ambulosono neural mechanism brain . The investigator investigate long-term impact Ambulosono brain plasticity functional MRI technique . Participants undergo 3 month Ambulosono train pre-training post-training fMRI brain scan compare understand neural network brain mechanism follow intervention . The investigator hypothesize Ambulosono may induce functional compensatory reorganization neural network brain . This project allow u address important potential confound placebo influence aid optimize intervention program . Additionally , investigator hop investigate synergistic effect rasagiline exercise ; investigator ' hypothesis positive synergistic effect , exercise augment effectiveness rasagiline treat Parkinson 's symptom .</brief_summary>
