	<brief_summary>Objectives : To evaluate effectiveness toxicity combination infusional cisplatin 24-hour infusion high-dose fluorouracil plus leucovorin ( P-HDFL ) repeatedly every 21 day treatment stage IVB , recurrent metastatic carcinoma cervix . Methods : The medical record patient stage IVB , recurrent metastatic cervical cancer treat P-HDFL regimen January 2005 December 2009 National Taiwan University Hospital review . Expected result : Investigators identify effectiveness toxicity combination infusional cisplatin 24-hour infusion high-dose fluorouracil plus leucovorin ( P-HDFL ) repeatedly every 21days treatment stage IVB , recurrent metastatic carcinoma cervix .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Plus One-Day 24-hour Infusion High-Dose 5-Fluorouracil Stage IVB , Recurrent Metastatic Carcinoma Uterine Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical record patient advance , metastatic recurrent cervical cancer treat P-HDFL regimen January 2005 December 2009 National Taiwan University Hospital review . Recurrences confirm histopathologic examination . Cases recurrent cervical cancer , undergoing salvage surgery receive P-HDFL adjuvant therapy , exclude study . The general principle patient schedule P-HDFL regimen treatment following : patient must white cell count &gt; 3000/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100000/mm3 , normal serum creatinine ( ≦1.5 mg/dL ) measure creatinine clearance ( [ urine creatinine level ( mg/dL ) X 24-hr urine amount ( mL ) ] / [ serum creatinine level ( mg/dL ) X 1,440 min ] ) ≧ 40 mL/min [ 12,15 ] , total bilirubin ≦ 2 mg/dL , transaminase ( ≦3X upper normal limit ) . Also , patient need measurable disease radiographic study ( plain X-ray , CT MRI scan ) , serious active underlying medical issue , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . The ethical approval retrospective study obtain research ethic committee hospital . The P-HDFL regimen give follow : In 21-day cycle , patient receive 24-hour infusion cisplatin 45 50 mg/m2 5-FU 2,600mg/m2 plus leucovorin 300 mg/m2 intravenous 24-hour infusion Day 1 . Normal saline hydration ( ≧1000 mL ) , dexamethasone , antiemetic ( ondansetron granisetron ) give prophylactically dose cisplatin . Physical examination , survey adverse reaction hemogram checkup patient perform administer dose P-HDFL treatment . Tumor response toxicity evaluate accord World Health Organization criterion [ 16 ] . A complete response ( CR ) define disappearance measurable disease least 4 week . A partial response ( PR ) define 50 % reduction product measurable lesion least 4 week . Progressive disease ( PD ) define 25 % increase size one measurable lesion appearance new lesion . Stable disease ( SD ) define condition meeting criterion . Progression-free survival measure first date chemotherapy date document disease progression , death cause last contact . Overall survival measure first date chemotherapy death last contact . Progression-free survival overall survival estimate use method Kaplan-Meier .</detailed_description>
