	<brief_summary>This study evaluate LumaScan , innovative polarization microscope real time , intraoperative image evaluation surface excise tissue excise Breast Conservation Surgery ( BCS ) non invasive invasive breast cancer . The investigator hypothesis LumaScan comparable cancer detection conventional histopathologic evaluation area breast tissue . The real time , intraoperative image provide LumaScan help improve BCS lessen need BCS re-excision surgery lead high cost , poor cosmetic outcome , reduce survival rate , loss confidence tissue conservation surgery procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Margin Delineation Using Polarization Subtraction Imaging Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LumaScan innovative polarization microscope use Polarization Subtraction Imaging ( PSI ) technology provide real time , intra operative , digital image surface tissue remove BCS breast cancer . PSI use polarize visible light optical section geometric image superficial layer surgically remove tissue reject surface scatter light deep layer . By reject light deep tissue PSI able exclusively focus superficial tissue layer . This also result high resolution image possible standard optical imaging . PSI use reflectance fluorescence mode . Reflectance detect morphologic abnormality occur tumor progression increase nuclear density , angiogenesis , cellular infiltration crowd fluorescence detects early biochemical change . To enhance contrast tumor margin investigator use Methylene blue ( MB ) , dye commonly use breast surgery mapping sentinel lymph node . MB administer peritumorally quickly take cell minute exposure presence interfere preclude later histopathology tissue specimen . A tumor specimen may also dip MB post-excision achieve tumor margin contrast enhancement interfere pathologic assessment . Previous research use PSI technology demonstrate value PSI map tumor boundary breast cancer excise tissue specimens non-melanoma skin cancer boundary side side comparison correlate well marked pathologist representative section prepare use standard H &amp; E staining procedure .</detailed_description>
