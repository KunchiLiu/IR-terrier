	<brief_title>Helium-3 MRI Imaging Study COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) important cause morbidity , mortality , healthcare cost worldwide . COPD characterize progressive airflow limitation fully reversible associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas . It become clear simple measure airflow obstruction inadequate relate lung function exercise capacity symptom , complex expression dynamic hyper-inflation need invoke seek understand overall physiology . In addition abnormality air flow , gas exchange also derange . Therefore consider new treatment approach , abnormality need address . Techniques study ventilation variation perfusion match across lung exist invasive exacting , give indication anatomical distribution change . There clear need technique provide sensitive , useful safe repeat measure reflect regional change ventilation gas exchange COPD . This study investigate use hyperpolarised helium magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) reflect regional difference lung function moderate severe COPD patient . A Beta2 bronchodilator - Salbutamol - anticholinergic - Ipratropium - use study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) diagnosis : establish clinical history chronic pulmonary disorder accordance follow description American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society [ ATS / ETS , 2004 ] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease preventable treatable disease characterise airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . The patient clinically stable change symptom medication , admission hospital , neither antibiotic therapy systemic steroid use least 6 week prior screen . ( Screening may reschedule appropriate period stability ) Male female patient age ≥50 year A female patient eligible participate nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) ≥40 M1U/mL estradiol ≤ 40 pg/mL ( ≤140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ) . Subjects refrain shortacting bronchodilator 8 hour , longacting β2agonists ( include longacting β2 agonist contain inhaler ) theophyllines 24 hour Tiotropium , phosphodiesterase4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor ( e.g . Roflumilast ) ultra longacting betaadrenoceptor agonist ( e.g . Indacaterol ) 48 hour prior admission unit study day . Subjects postbronchodilator FEV1 FVC ratio ( FEV1/FVC ) &lt; 0.7 Subjects postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30 % ≤ 80 % predict normal height , age sex screen . Subjects cigarette smoke history ≥10 pack year ( 1 pack year = 20 cigarette smoke per day 1 year equivalent ) . Both current former smoker eligible enrol . Resting SpO2 &gt; 90 % room air QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block ( base single ECG value ) . The patient able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction , give informed consent . Unstable cardiac disease history clinically significant arrhythmia ( include establish atrial fibrillation ) . Patients primary diagnosis α1 antitrypsin deficiency . Patients significant respiratory disorder . Patients acute infection , exacerbation COPD unstable medical condition . Patients inhale beta2 agonist anticholinergic contraindicate . Patients undergone thoracic surgery include lung volume reduction surgery condition prevent perform spirometry physiological testing . Patients non Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) compatible ( ferromagnetic metallic implant , pacemaker ) per MRI questionnaire . Patients renal complaint relate potential adverse reaction GdDTPA intravascular MRI contrast agent . Patients suffer claustrophobia . The patient participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first study day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) study . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Subjects must abstain take prescription ( related COPD ) nonprescription drug ( include vitamin dietary herbal supplement ) , within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first study day completion followup visit , unless opinion Investigator sponsor medication interfere study . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .</criteria>
