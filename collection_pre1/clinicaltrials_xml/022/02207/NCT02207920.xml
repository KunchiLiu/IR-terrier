	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Different Combinations DNA-HIV-PT123 AIDSVAX® B/E Vaccines Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity combination two different experimental HIV vaccines—the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine—administered different sequence simultaneously , healthy adult infect HIV . Participants randomly assign four group . Depending group participant , receive different combination DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine , AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine , placebo DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine , and/or placebo AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine . Study visit occur study entry , Week 2 , Months 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 9 , 12 . All participant receive assign combination vaccine study entry Months 1 , 3 , 6 . At vaccination visit , participant receive one injection upper arm . Following vaccination , participant remain clinic 30 minute monitor . All study visit include physical examination , HIV risk reduction counseling , questionnaires assessment . Select study visit also include urine collection , blood collection , pregnancy test participant bear female , HIV test counseling .</detailed_description>

For participant receive control/placebo HIV vaccine trial , HVTN 105 Protocol Safety Review Team ( PSRT ) determine eligibility casebycase basis . NonHIV experimental vaccine ( ) receive within last 5 year prior vaccine trial . Exceptions may make vaccine subsequently undergone licensure FDA . For participant receive control/placebo experimental vaccine trial , HVTN 105 PSRT determine eligibility casebycase basis . For participant receive experimental vaccine ( ) 5 year ago , eligibility enrollment determine HVTN 105 PSRT casebycase basis .
