	<brief_summary>Young athletes usually regard special subgroup healthy individual unique lifestyle apparently invulnerable often capable extraordinary physical achievement . Most athletic discipline extent combine endurance strength mode physical conditioning . Acute response endurance exercise training include substantial increase maximal oxygen uptake , cardiac output , stroke volume , systolic blood pressure in-spite , high intensity chronic training marathon , long distance bicycle race etc. , lead transient acute volume overload atrium right ventricle , transient reduction right ventricular ejection fraction elevation cardiac biomarkers . Although biomarkers generally normalize back within seven ten day , transient change may sooner later mark begin process like patchy myocardial fibrosis finally lead grave chronic heart disease . Inspite awareness regard cardio vascular risk athlete , new advancement find alternate option protect cardio vascular system athlete . Hence order address need hour also avoid cardio vascular risk athlete along improvise endurance capacity , Enovate Biolife process development innovative product `` E-OJ-01 '' . E-OJ-01 expect beneficial effect cardio vascular system athletes enhance ejection fraction turn improve cardiac output . This finally hypothysed increase maximal oxygen uptake capacity athlete .</brief_summary>
