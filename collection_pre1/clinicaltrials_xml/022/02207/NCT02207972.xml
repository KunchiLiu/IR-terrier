	<brief_summary>The investigator believe ultrasound guide CSE technique accurately place epidural needle midline position compare epidural needle placement via palpation anatomical landmark . This result positive CSF spinal needle , correct placement catheter , adequate symmetrical labor analgesia/anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Ultrasound Help With Placement Labor Analgesia Pregnant Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidurals provide superior labor analgesia anesthesia . Unfortunately , failure epidural anesthesia analgesia frequent clinical problem . In heterogeneous cohort 2,140 surgical patient , failure rate 27 % lumbar epidural described . However , definition fail epidural broad . Different definition include insufficient analgesia catheter dislodgement conversion general anesthesia . Epidural analgesia failure may result technical difficulty , insufficiency overdose local anesthetic , epidural septum midline adhesion , placement epidural catheter intervertebral foramen anterior epidural space . In image study fail epidural , incorrect catheter placement account half failure , remain patient experienced suboptimal analgesia correctly position catheter . The incidence overall failure lower patient receive combine spinal-epidural ( CSE ) catheter versus epidural analgesia . In one study , CSE technique provide decreased failure rate labor analgesia comparable decreased failure rate surgical anesthesia , compare report failure rate epidural anesthesia . It believe positive CSF flow spinal needle confirms correct epidural needle placement epidural space also confirm epidural needle midline position . Placement epidural needle midline position minimize incorrect placement catheter one side , provide symmetrical analgesia versus unilateral analgesia . However , practice CSE epidural catheter placement relies palpation anatomical landmark always easy feel . Therefore , epidural needle maybe place `` midline '' despite positive loss resistance ( LOR ) cause negative CSF flow spinal needle incorrectly place catheter . As result , incorrect catheter placement result `` fail '' suboptimal epidural analgesia . Ultrasound recently utilize facilitate lumbar epidural spinal . The US image lumbar spine different scan plane facilitates identification landmark necessary appropriate epidural space location pregnant patient . There two acoustic window effective lumbar spine sonographic assessment : one see transverse approach , see longitudinal paramedian approach . The ultrasound single-screen method use transverse approach lumbar spine provide reliable information regard landmark require labor epidural . The correct interspace midline position identify correct placement CSE analgesia .</detailed_description>
