	<brief_summary>Epilepsy occur 0.5-0.7 % population , 25 % child . 30 % Of patient focal epilepsy respond well medication half eligible epilepsy surgery . In recent year , importance early epilepsy surgery stress , successful surgery may lead seizure medication freedom improve social cognitive development , especially child . The current success rate epilepsy surgery around 65 % ; During surgery intracranial electrocorticography ( acute ECoG , aECoG ) record medical center . The presence epileptiform brian activity , spike , identify clinical neurophysiologists , use guide neurosurgeon extent brain tissue need resect . Spikes consider marker presence epilepsy . High Frequency Oscillations ( HFOs , &gt; 80-500Hz ) ECoG recently identify new biomarker epileptogenic tissue . Retrospective research show local presence strongly relate seizure onset , removal tissue HFOs could predict well surgical outcome . The area show HFOs usually overlap , small area spike , HFOs tend propagate distant sit spike . The identification HFOs objective spike automatic detection software exist . A pilot study perform test hypothesis : The intra-operative use HFOs delineate epileptogenic cortex yield significantly bad outcome seizure freedom current method base spike . Study design single blind multi-center randomized control trial . In two Dutch center , VU medical center ( Amsterdam ) University Medical Center Utrecht . The study population ( sample size 78 ) consist patient age refractory epilepsy undergo epilepsy surgery aECoG guide extent resection . Eligible patient randomise , informed consent , group 1 ( HFOs ) resection guide HFOs aECoG ( new ) , group 2 ( spike ) resection guide epileptiform spike aECoG ( current standard ) . Ictiform spike pattern always resect . Main study endpoint outcome epilepsy surgery 1 year follow-up dichotomized total seizure freedom ( Engel Ia &amp; b ) vs. seizure recurrence ( Engel Ic-IV ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients age : Refractory Focal Epilepsy ; least â‰¥2 experience seizure past 24 month , spite 2 different antiepileptic drug try . Planned neurosurgery aECoG , goal tailor resection . Command Dutch language patient/parents/legal representative capability complete questionnaire ( email phone ) . Patients underwent chronic ECoG monitoring precede epilepsy surgery ( grid ) . This biased population , since result extensive presurgical workup well result cECoG monitoring period include final decision make regard resection , precise seizure onset zone well spike HFO area know . Patients occipital focus undergo aECoG . Currently , possible discriminate pathological physiological occipital HFOs , thus unsafe perform HFO guide resection patient presumed occipital focus .</criteria>
