	<brief_title>Influence Hyaluronic Acid Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Local Side Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) consider effective treatment increase disease-free interval reduce progression non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) [ 1 ] . Although consider safe , BCG produce local systemic side effect lead treatment discontinuation interruption . The common local side-effects BCG intravesical instillation include cystitis , characterize irritative voiding symptom hematuria , occur approximately 75 % patient . More rarely , serious local adverse event result BCG infection , symptomatic granulomatous prostatitis epididymo-orchitis , might occur require permanent discontinuation BCG treatment . Systemic side-effects include flu-like symptom , general malaise fever , occur approximately 40 % patient . A high persistent fever might relate BCG infection sepsis . Local systemic side-effects might lead discontinue intravesical BCG treatment approximately 20 % patient [ 2 ] . Up 54 % patient undergoing intravesical therapy chemotherapeutic agent treat superficial bladder tumour affect nonbacterial cystitis [ 3 ] . Several solution propose reduce occurrence side effect BCG aim limit BCG discontinuation concomitant discomfort endovesical treatment . Some Authors propose avoid BCG administration case TUR within previous 2 week , traumatic catheterization , macroscopic hematuria , urethral stenosis , active tuberculosis , prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin sepsis , immuno-suppression urinary tract infection [ 4 ] . Other procedure include prophylactic administration isoniazid [ 5 ] ofloxacin [ 6,7 ] usually involve BCG dose reduction [ 8 ] . In common practice antimicrobial , anticholinergic , anaesthetic analgesic often use relieve patient ' symptom . Glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) substitution therapy emerge treatment Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis ( BPS/IC ) response rate 30 % 80 % described intravesical administration various GAGs ( hyaluronic acid , pentosan polysulfate , heparin , chondroitin sulfate , dimethyl sulfoxide ) [ 9,10 ] . Few paper report result GAG substitution therapy treatment radiation chemical cystitis [ 9,10 ] . To knowledge , date , two paper describe GAG use treatment BCG local side effect ; paper show good result , significant reduction lower urinary tract symptom intravesical administration HA [ 11,12 ] . Aim present randomize pilot study evaluate sequential administration HA BCG could safe prevention early recurrence progression bladder tumor , safe reduction local side-effects patient high risk NMIBC .</detailed_description>
