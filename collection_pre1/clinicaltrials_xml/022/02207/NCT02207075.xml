	<detailed_description>This pilot study design determine baseline longitudinal regional-specific change uptake [ 11C ] PK-11195 subject secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) . Eighteen subject SPMS enrol two-year study . Given low sample size , stable treatment regimen require control potential treatment effect . In addition , subject must current therapy least 6 month ensure measurement reflective true disease activity treatment effect . Thirteen age-matched healthy control ( HC ) enrol . The role HC establish variability `` noise '' associate instrument ( test-retest ) , ensure PK uptake measured time point MS biologically relevant . This proposal also include sub-study validate non-invasive quantification methodology PK-PET . The rigorous method , gold standard , quantify PET data base upon measure arterial input function . Measuring radioactivity within arterial circulation require arterial cannulation . Arterial cannulation consider safe ; however , labor-intensive often discourage subject participation . Image-derived input function ( IDIF ) method calculate input function without cannulation artery use image data . Studies human research volunteer still require compare result obtain classical arterial sample IDIF . The current study validate IDIF substitute arterial sample context . All healthy control undergo validation process , include arterial venous sampling . This validation also require within subject . Subjects give option participate validation stage . Absolute Quantification PK-PET ( gold standard arterial sampling ) : Catheters place radial artery characterize plasma input function . This make possible use two tissue reversible plasma input ( 2T4k ) model . Blood sample acquire use online continuous blood sampling device well manually discrete time ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 60 minute post injection ) . The continuous sampling use measure activity concentration whole blood , discrete manual sampling use calculate plasma concentration , estimate fraction radioactive metabolite use HPLC . The total blood loss estimate 8-10 tablespoon ( 120-150 mL , one third amount volunteer donate Red Cross give blood ) . To generate plasma input function , ratio plasma data whole blood calculate manual blood sample fit point model one- two-exponential function . Metabolite correction accomplish multiply plasma curve function obtainable fit measure parent fraction . Venous blood similarly obtain IDIF metabolic correction utilized validation classic arterial sampling . The investigator acquire 6 venous sample 3 mL 2 mL purge prior sample , total blood loss 30 mL ( one fluid ounce , 6.67 % amount volunteer donate Red Cross give blood ) . Dynamic PET acquisition processing : The data acquire list mode facilitate processing dynamic framing rate . Innate immunity recognize major cause tissue injury central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . In study investigator specifically quantify innate immune inflammatory burden cohort secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) subject . Our hypothesis innate immune response heighten SPMS compare healthy control ( HC 's ) activity increase time correlate ongoing neuronal loss disability . The investigator test hypothesis use highly specific molecular imaging technique , specifically PET , conjunction high field MRI . The investigator utilize PET radioligand [ 11C ] 1533 ; PK11195 bind translocator protein 18 kDa ( TSPO ) activate macrophages/microglia . The investigator correlate [ 11C ] PK11195 uptake conventional measure inflammation neuronal integrity high-resolution MRI . MS chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system characterize focal T cell macrophage infiltrate associate demyelination . The primary innate immune cell MS consist infiltrate macrophages/monocytes resident microglia . Cells innate immune system effector cell function cause CNS injury direct effect neighbor cell , oligodendrocyte , generation soluble proinflammatory mediator distant effect cell , neuron . The innate immune inflammatory thus sufficient explain focal injury diffuse injury . In majority subject , MS begin relapsing-remitting course eventually evolve state progressive decline disability . Focal inflammatory demyelinate lesion predominant pathological finding subject relapse disease whereas diffuse axonal injury microglial activation find hallmark progressive disease.1 Microglial activation occur either response CNS injury example Wallerian degeneration , response signal inflammatory cell include macrophage lymphocyte . Activated microglia infiltrate macrophage express TSPO ( previously refer peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ) detect radioligand [ 11C ] PK-111952 . Determination significance [ 11C ] PK-11195 uptake within cohort MS subject would require correlation HCÂ¿s ensure observation valid measurement disease activity . The MS subject also two baseline [ 11C ] PK-11195 PET scan ( separate 24 72 hour , test-retest ) measure disease relate intra-individual variability subsequent scan 6 , 12 24 month . Baseline test-retest [ 11C ] PK-11195 PET uptake MS subject HC 's compare ensure minimal disease-related variability ensure baseline subsequent longitudinal measurement MS subject meet level biological significance . One baseline brain MRI require HC MS subject . Subjects brain MRI 's 6 , 12 24 month . Objective : Aim 1 : To quantify level activity dynamic change innate immune inflammatory burden course two year cohort SPMS subject . Primary objective : Measure level baseline change whole brain uptake [ 11C ] PK-11195 6 , 12 24 month SPMS subject . Objectives : - To correlate change T2-hyperintense lesion volume 6,12 24 month whole brain uptake [ 11C ] PK-11195 PET ( 6,12 24 month ) SPMS subject . - To correlate change conventional MRI measure neuronal integrity ( Gray Matter Fraction , White Matter Fraction , whole brain volume , T1-hypointense lesion volume ) 6,12 24 month whole brain PET uptake [ 11C ] PK-11195 ( 6,12 24 month ) SPMS subject . - To correlate change whole brain PET uptake [ 11C ] PK-11195 ( 6,12 24 month ) level disability , measure change EDSS 6 , 12 , 24 month SPMS subject .</detailed_description>
