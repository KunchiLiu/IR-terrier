	<brief_summary>Patients undergo chronic dialysis substantially increase risk cardiac death . The reason excess cardiovascular mortality partly understood . Classical complicate artherosclerotic disease appear primary cause cardiac death chronic dialysis patient . In fact , predictive potential classic cardiovascular risk factor hypertension , obesity hyperlipidemia appear reduced dialysis . In contrast , series pilot study find cardiac biomarkers adequately reflect dialysis induce myocardial stunning , progressive cardiovascular disease , risk death . To extend corroborate result , plan large , prospective , observational study enrol unselected hemo- peritoneal dialysis patient . The propose study , power calculation hypothesis base pilot study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patient identify clinical care team undergo chronic dialysis one study centre . Dialysis patient initially approach routine dialysis session member clinical team discus study participant information sheet provide . A minimum 2 day provision participant information sheet , clinical team inform research team patient interested study . Potential participant re-approached person train research physician determine whether willing participate study . If interested , information sheet discuss question answer . The investigator explain nature study , purpose , procedure involve , expect duration , potential risk benefit discomfort may entail potential participant . Each participant inform participation study voluntary he/she may withdraw study time withdrawal consent affect his/her subsequent medical assistance treatment . All potential study participant provide participant information sheet consent form describe study provide sufficient information participant make inform decision participation study . The participant give copy sign document . The consent form must also sign date investigator ( designee ) retain part study record . After consent obtain , participant allocate unique study identification ( ID ) code . Patients free discontinue participation study time , without give reason withdrawal . Patient exposure censor discontinuation dialysis regain renal function patient 's wish , study withdrawal transfer patient non-participating dialysis unit . Patients undergoing renal transplantation observational period censor , reassess 3 6 month transplantation . First , write informed consent obtain patient . After obtain informed consent patient undergo standard three time weekly hemodialysis session daily peritoneal dialysis session . At time enrolment trial patient undergo detailed clinical assessment include medical history physical examination . At begin end dialysis session , time monthly routine blood test additional venous blood sample collect . Serial assessment perform 6 monthly interval enrollment target meet . After reach enrollment target observational period continue another year .</detailed_description>
