	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cancer pancreas one common cancer form Sweden . Nine-hundred person receive diagnosis every year . The 5-year survival low , 5 15 % , even case radical resection tumor perform . This probably due minimal residual disease diagnose time surgery . It recently show micrometastases pancreatic adenocarcinoma detect tissue sample lymph node bone marrow , use new sensitive immunohistological method . When radical resection tumour perform , microscopically visible tumour leave , even situation , local recurrence disease common cause death patient . None far study adjuvant treatment , irradiation chemotherapy , substantially improve survival patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) establish curative treatment malignant blood disease , mainly leukemia . Using conventional form HSCT , patient undergoes myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy irradiation , diminish amount malignant cell , also create space bone marrow donate stem cell . The myeloablative conditioning induces severe toxic effect , patient rescue transplantation donate hematopoietic stem cell . The new stem cell mature immune system react patient 's cell , effect call graft-versus-host reaction ( GVHD ) . It show graft-versus-host reaction correlate well curative anti-tumor effect . A mild GVH reaction diminish risk relapse , severe GVH reaction might mortal . This anti-tumour effect mediate white blood cell T-cell type . From knowledge , HSCT technique develop nowadays possible use reduce intensity conditioning ( RIC ) . With reduced intensity conditioning use mild form chemotherapy , toxic effect reduce , immunosuppressive effect enough make sure hematopoietic stem cell engraft . Using RIC lead treatment old patient anti-tumor effect efficient myeloablative conditioning . Recently , RIC HSCT use adjuvant treatment solid tumour , mainly kidney cancer , colon cancer breast cancer . An important part treatment consist additional infusion donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) transplantation maintain increase anti-tumour effect . At clinic , treat 50 patient solid tumour use RIC HSCT . Most patient kidney colon cancer ( 19 16 patient , respectively ) , also two patient prostate cancer treat . About ten patient primary liver cancer treat liver transplantation combine RIC HSCT . The transplantation-related mortality patient 10-15 % . Aim : To study antitumour effect RIC HSCT patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma radical resection tumour adjuvant treatment standard chemotherapy . Importance : If investigator accomplish anti-tumour effect use RIC HSCT adjuvant treatment patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma , might increase survival even cure patient group poor prognosis . Primary scientific question : Can investigator demonstrate anti-tumour effect pancreatic adenocarcinoma use adjuvant treatment HSCT ? Secondary scientific question : What side-effects patient suffer ? Can survival improve compare standard treatment pancreatic adenocarcinoma ? Is possible improve result use cytotoxic T-cells specific pancreatic adenocarcinoma antigen ? Are method identify patient best result treatment ? How quality life affect ? Study plan : The aim study evaluate anti-tumour effect treatment RIC HSCT patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma . All patient undergo curative surgery radical resection tumour adjuvant standard chemotherapy gemcitabine . HSCT offer patient HLA-identical sibling , kind biological randomisation . The control group consist patient without HLA-identical sibling , decline HSCT . Inclusion criterion : Patients radically resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive adjuvant treatment standard chemotherapy surgery . Exclusion criterion : Pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastases non-radical resection tumour . Relapse standard chemotherapy . Age 70 year . Severe heart condition , liver disease , impaired kidney function organ dysfunction result severe toxic effect HSCT treatment . Group A undergo radical resection tumour standard chemotherapy . About eight month surgery , undergo conditioning cyclophosphamide fludarabine transplantation donate hematopoietic stem cell HLA-identical sibling donor . The immunosuppressive treatment , give diminish GVHD , taper quickly make sure anti-tumour effect efficient fast possible . Further infusion DLI give increase maintain anti-tumour effect case graft-versus-host reaction miss mild . The first DLI give intravenously second one give A. hepatica induce well local effect , since metastasis liver common event . Conditioning HSCT perform Centre Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation also follow-up patient perform . The surgical follow-up surgical department . Group B treat standard chemotherapy accord current protocol department oncology . The clinical laboratory parameter register : - Mortality - Morbidity - Time relapse , control CT scan - Quality life - Tumour marker - Detection cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ability react pancreactic adenocarcinoma patient well cell line vitro - Detection micrometastases bone marrow .</detailed_description>
