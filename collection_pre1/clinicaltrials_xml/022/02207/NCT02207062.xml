	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Transformed Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Perform preliminary assessment efficacy single-agent ibrutinib , base overall response rate , subject relapse refractory transform indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( R/R TIL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability chronic ibrutinib therapy patient population . II . To determine disease control rate regimen . III . Evaluate complete response rate , overall survival , progression-free survival single-agent ibrutinib patient population . IV . Determine response rate relative underlie B-cell histology . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
