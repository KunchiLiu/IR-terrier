	<brief_title>Crizotinib Combination With Enzalutamide Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme use identify recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) crizotinib use combination standard fix dose enzalutamide . - Patients fulfill eligibility criterion enter trial receive crizotinib enzalutamide . - After screen procedure confirm participation research study : - The participant give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . The investigator look high dose combination study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose give depend number participant enrol study prior well dose tolerate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Laboratory diagnostic test , MRIs CT scan , require eligibility must document test perform within 30 day prior date registration . The patient pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate The subject must CRPC castrate level serum testosterone less 50 ng/dL . NOTE : Subjects must maintain castrate state . If orchiectomy must continue receive LHRH GnRH agonists unless intolerant . Evidence metastatic disease radiographic imaging ( bone scan nodal visceral lesion CT MRI ) Prostate cancer progression since last prior therapy document PSA accord PCWG2 radiographic progression accord modify RECIST criterion Version 1.1 No limit number type prior therapy Prior treatment docetaxel permit required Prior treatment ketoconazole , estrogens , abiraterone novel antiandrogens allow , include past enzalutamide Require least 6 week withdrawal period last dose bicalutamide , nilutamide 4 week last flutamide enzalutamide dose Must document PSA rise stop antiandrogen Will require 2 week washout period last dose ketoconazole , chemotherapy , radiation Prior radiation allow Age ≥18 year ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( See Appendix 1 ) Life expectancy great 6 month Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL *Transfusions erythropoietin supplementation permit Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( unless know Gilbert 's syndrome ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ≤5X presence liver metastasis *For patient document bone metastasis , AST &gt; 2.5x ULN investigator provide evidence underlie liver dysfunction thus , likely AST originate bone source . Creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Able swallow study drug whole tablet The effect crizotinib enzalutamide develop human fetus unknown . For reason investigational agent well standard antiandrogen agent use trial may teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion crizotinib administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Pathology consistent small cell carcinoma prostate Prior treatment cMet inhibitor Participants receive investigational systemic agent last 2 week . Persistent grade &gt; 1 ( NCI CTCAE v4.0 ) AEs due investigational drug administer 14 day study enrollment exception alocepia . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction seizure would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition crizotinib enzalutamide . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke significant brain trauma , history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month study entry ) . Concomitant medication would lower seizure threshold Concomitant use medication may alter pharmacokinetics crizotinib enzalutamide . See section 5.5 , would exclude use strong CYP3A CYP2C8 inhibitor , strong moderate CYP3A inducer , CYP2C8 , CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 CYP2C19 substrates narrow therapeutic indice . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequentlyupdated list : http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant heart disease define : Myocardial infarction within 6 month Screening visit . Uncontrolled angina within 3 month Screening visit . Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , subject history congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 4 past , history anthracycline anthracenedione ( mitoxantrone ) treatment , unless screen echocardiogram multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) perform within three month Screening visit result leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥45 % . History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsade de pointes ) . Prolonged correct QT interval Fridericia correction formula ( QTcF ) screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) &gt; 470 msec . History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place . Hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 mmHg ) bradycardia heart rate &lt; 50 beat per minute Screening ECG , unless pharmaceutically induce thus reversible ( i.e . beta blocker ) know , chronic asymptomatic baseline heart rate . Uncontrolled hypertension indicate rest systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg Screening visit . No medication know prolong QT interval crizotinib may increase risk QT prolongation Thrombosis vascular ischemic event within last six month , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , transient ischemic attack , cerebral infarction , myocardial infarction No medication know prolong QT interval crizotinib may increase risk QT prolongation Pregnant woman exclude study woman get prostate cancer , prostate . No defined washout period major minor surgery require incision must fully heal . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction crizotinib enzalutamide . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .
