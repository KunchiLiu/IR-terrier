	<brief_title>A Phase 0 Study AZD1775 Recurrent GBM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients administer one dose AZD1775 prior surgical resection tumor . There 2 portion trial , refer Part 1 Part 2 . Part 1 involve dose escalation strategy 3 separate dos ( 100 , 200 , 400mg ) evaluate . Each dose cohort involve 4 patient . Surgery , tissue harvest determination tissue drug level biomarker evaluation , occur 8 hrs post drug administration . Part 2 determine potential tumor drug level PD effect various time interval drug administration single select drug dose . Currently , plan use dose ( 200 mg ) deem safe use combination cytotoxic therapy . However , result Part 1 suggest alternate dose may preferable , consider use alternate dose Part 2 . Dosing follow surgical resection 2-4 hr 22-26 hr post dose .</detailed_description>
