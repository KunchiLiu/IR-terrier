	<brief_summary>Recurrent herpes labialis usually minor malady limited duration , although often painful uniformly discomforting patient . Oral antiviral represent advance treatment recurrent herpes labialis , clinical implication modest . Randomized , control clinical trial show oral antiviral decrease duration lesion episodes pain approximately one day . In recurrent HSV infection include herpes labialis , many instance viral re-activation occur without symptom , identify detection virus lip infect individual . In case , virus clear local site without development classical ulcerative herpes lesion . In case , trigger specific immune response rapidly stop viral replication skin also cause development herpes lesion prodrome considerable part symptom associate classical ulcerative herpes lesion . One could therefore predict treatment antiviral drug alone would help immune system shorten virus replication , may substantially reduce disfigure symptom cause immune reaction . In dermatology , principle use anti-inflammatory drug improve clinical outcome reduce inflammation-related symptom associate infection well establish . We find topical formulation VDO useful alleviate pain inflammation associate infection cause herpes virus .</brief_summary>
