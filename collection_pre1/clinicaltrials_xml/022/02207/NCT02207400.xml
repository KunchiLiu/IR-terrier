At screen visit , follow provision write informed consent , eligible participant provide standard toothpaste toothbrush brush clinic approximately one week use home baseline visit . Participants ask abstain brush 12 hour period prior Baseline visit . At baseline visit oral soft tissue ( OST ) assessment , Modified Gingival Index ( MGI ) Bleeding Index ( BI ) , dental plaque assessment perform . Participants stratify accord baseline number bleed site , smoke status whether select bacterial sampling . Participants randomize one two treatment group . After use , assign treatment twice daily home 6 week ( visit 3 ) , 12 week ( visit 4 ) 24 week ( visit 5 ) , participant return site overnight plaque approximately time day Baseline visit possible . Participants undergo full OST examination record Adverse Events ( AEs ) . Participants undergo MGI , BI follow dental plaque assessment .
