In order investigate role vitro test individual ITI success rate patient undergo ITI , inhibitor plasma sample assay different FVIII concentrate use follow vitro test : Batch selection , Thrombin generation assay ( TGA ) , Thrombin Generation Test ( TGT ) monitor FVIII efficacy , Epitope mapping , IgG Subclasses specific FVIII , Immunogenotyping .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Survey Success Inhibitor Elimination Using Individualized Concentrate Selection Controlled ITI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result many technological advance last two decade , current factor VIII ( FVIII ) concentrate ( plasma-derived recombinant product ) consider safe term pathogen safety . The development inhibitor FVIII factor IX ( FIX ) consider major complication replacement therapy haemophiliac . Prospective study previously untreated patient ( PUPs ) suggest inhibitor develop 33 % patient moderate severe haemophilia A . Several strategy use control bleed patient , e.g . high-dose treatment FVIII concentrate , treatment activate prothrombin complex concentrate ( aPCC ) treatment activate factor VII ( FVIIa ) . Immune tolerance induction ( ITI ) order eradicate inhibitor patient suffer inhibitor FVIII high dose treatment FVIII first report 1977 Brackmann &amp; Gormsen so-called `` Bonn Protocol '' investigate series clinical study apply modified version `` Bonn Protocol '' . During investigation high dose FVIII treatment proven efficacious induce immune tolerance show exert long lasting effect 80 % patient treat . The observational immune tolerance induction research program ( ObsITI ) allow systematic prospective retrospective data documentation analysis success rate ITI use individualized concentrate selection . In order investigate role vitro test individual ITI success rate patient undergo ITI , inhibitor plasma sample assay different FVIII concentrate use follow vitro test : 1 . Batch selection : The potential variation inhibitor reactivity different FVIII concentrates/batches concentrate optionally study accord modify Oxford method ( HZRM Hämophilie-Zentrum Rhein Main , Germany ) . 2 . Thrombin generation assay ( TGA ) : In optional vitro test plasma sample inhibitor patient spike different concentrate thrombin generation measure use TGA evaluate potential different FVIII concentrate generate thrombin ( Haemophilia Centre Malmö , Sweden ) . 3 . Thrombin Generation Test ( TGT ) monitor FVIII efficacy : TGT evaluate correlation clinical bleeding phenotype patient thrombin generation capacity ITI order predict patient high risk bleeding . In vitro efficacy two FVIII dos ( low high ) presence absence FEIBA 80IU/kg evaluate . The aim study evaluate correlation clinical bleeding phenotype inhibitor patient ITI order detect patient high bleed risk . 4 . Epitope mapping : The antibody epitopes FVIII identify screen peptide library FVIII fragment inhibitor patient plasma . This help identify relevant epitope recognise inhibitor haemophilia A . This research program give opportunity comprehensively study various aspect inhibitor induction immunotolerance relevant number patient . Knowledge relevant epitope patient plasma rather model system ( i.e . monoclonal antibody mouse model ) help understand immune response FVIII develop novel strategy deplete inhibitor inhibitor secrete B cell ( University Hospital Frankfurt , Laboratory Molecular Haemostasis Immunodeficiencies , Frankfurt , Germany ) . 5 . IgG Subclasses specific FVIII : Plasma sample test IgG-subclasses specific FVIII . Most inhibitor belong subclass IgG1 IgG4 . There indication ratio IgG1 IgG4 might influence ITI outcome ( University Hospital Frankfurt , Laboratory Molecular Haemostasis Immunodeficiencies , Frankfurt , Germany ) . 6 . Immunogenotyping : In addition study investigate genetic risk factor ( gene defect responsible haemophilia , HLA class II allele , immune response gene ) potential variable impact course outcome ITI . Recently significantly high inhibitor incidence find patient ( brother ) IL-10.G allele 134 , TNFA - 308G &gt; A polymorphism within Hap polymorphisms CTLA-4-gene compare brother without mention polymorphism ( University Hospital Bonn , Haemophilia Centre , Bonn , Germany ) . 7 . Immune-monitoring patient undergo ITI : The evolution several `` marker `` immune response treatment inhibitor-positive patient high dose FVIII evaluate subgroup ≥40 patient . The goal study identify `` immune marker `` may predict positive outcome immune tolerance induction , ( Sebastien Lacroix-Desmazes , INSERM , Paris , France , Christoph Königs , Laboratory Molecular Haemostasis Immunodeficiencies University Hospital Frankfurt , Germany .</detailed_description>
