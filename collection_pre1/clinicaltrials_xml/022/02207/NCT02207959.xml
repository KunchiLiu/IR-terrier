	<brief_summary>The overall objective pilot study determine whether multispectral imaging increase diagnostic accuracy current standard high-definition white-light endoscopy detection gastric neoplasia ( high grade dysplasia cancer ) . As part NCI-funded RO1 , investigator goal develop multispectral endoscopic platform use survey large surface area , potentially , serve `` red flag '' microendoscopic image small area . In prior ex vivo evaluation surgical endoscopic specimen , investigator identify optical setting illumination wavelength complementary white-light imaging enhance superficial mucosal vascular change associate neoplasia . Based initial testing , vital-dye enhance fluorescence imaging ( VFI ) image High Resolution Microendoscope ( HRME ) identify modality may complementary white-light imaging . The goal pilot study preliminarily determine accuracy modality endoscopic surveillance detection gastric neoplasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consent obtain day subject 's schedule endoscopy clinical room routine office visit prior endoscopy . The study investigator explain study include reason subject may eligible , risk , benefit . The subject give chance address question concern may . If patient agrees participate study procedure list perform day schedule endoscopy exam . The procedure list part routine standard care endoscopy exam , except image take additional 2-6 biopsy take abnormal area see new image technique . The use imaging technique describe research study change standard care procedure . The endoscopic procedure outline : 1 . White Light Examination : Examination initially perform standard white-light endoscopic mode routinely do . Abnormal gastric mucosa area nodularities record . Any `` Suspicious '' area ( visible abnormality , etc . ) photograph location record ( distance incisor endoscopic quadrant , eq . 34 cm ; great curvature , less curvature , etc ) . 2 . Vital-Dye Enhanced Fluorescence Examination : Following , stomach spray 1-10 ml 0.01 % proflavine use standard endoscopic spray-catheter . Using fluorescent imaging , location VFI- '' Suspicious ' area record . Additionally , VFI examination suspicious area see WLE perform . The endoscopist label surface-appearance WLE abnormal area base VFI appearance . Thus , area label : `` Not Suspicious , '' `` Suspicious Neoplasia . '' 3 . HRME examination : WLE VFI suspicious appear area image HRME . HRME insert biopsy channel endoscope , gently place mucosa , image suspicious area obtain . The endoscopist label surface-appearance WLE abnormal area VFI abnormal area , base HRME appearance . Thus , area label : `` Not Suspicious , '' `` Suspicious Neoplasia . '' 4 . Biopsy Protocol : Biopsies obtain area suspicious image modality ( WLE , VFI HRME ) . Additionally , two 'control ' area ( normal imaging ) also biopsied . Lastly , routine , biopsy perform per clinical care determine area intestinal metaplasia H pylori infection per routine standard care . 5 . Pathologic Interpretation : All sample evaluate single expert gastrointestinal pathologist blind endoscopic finding</detailed_description>
