	<brief_summary>In study , investigator aim use light mask ( Noctura 400 ) test hypothesis prevent dark adaptation associate hypoxia rod eye could turn prevent halt progression centre-involving Diabetic Macular Oedema ( DMO ) . DMO devastate disease common cause registerable blindness work age-group United Kingdom ( UK ) This multi-centred randomise control trial involve 240 patient . Post randomization , participant intervention arm wear Noctura 400 Light Mask night 48 week conjunction routine , prescribe treatment intravitreal ( eye ) ranibizumab . Those standard arm receive routine , prescribed ranibizumab treatment . The primary objective determine whether utilize Noctura 400 Light Mask night reduces number intravitreal injection ranibizumab require patient undergoing course treatment DMO .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes regard World Health Organisation ( WHO ) global epidemic , global diabetic population anticipate exceed 500 million 2020 . In UK 3.5 million people diabetes growth rate exceed 150,000 people per year . Diabetic Retinopathy ( DR ) common complication diabetes , common cause sight threaten retinopathy Diabetic Macular Oedema ( DMO ) . This condition characterise leakage fluid compromise blood vessel central retina 240,000 ( 8 % ) people diabetes UK clinically significant DMO , 100,000 people DMO visual impairment . DMO common cause registerable blindness work age-group UK . The Diabetic Eye Screening Programme ( DESP ) annually photograph 3 million people diabetes cost £65 million ensure early diagnosis sight threaten complication . All patient diabetic maculopathy refer Hospital Eye Service ( HES ) . Clinically significant macular oedema require treatment . Non-central oedema usually keep close monitoring laser treatment advocate . Centre involve macular oedema usually treat intravitreal injection inhibitor Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( anti-VEGF ) . Whilst laser treatment reduce risk moderate visual loss 50 % , effective restore best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) significant , quality life impact side effect . The anti-VEGF treatment costly cause significant burden patient , care-givers healthcare system . A patient DR never leave HES . With diabetes rise cost care ever increase population grow year year . This put immense strain resource budget healthcare system . In trial investigator explore health economic impact new , novel therapy DMO provide Noctura 400 Light Mask . The Light Mask provide non-invasive , light therapy administer home patient . If successful , introduction Noctura 400 Light Mask treatment could bring significant benefit patient healthcare system . This trial design randomise control trial allow direct assessment Noctura 400 treatment base comparison control arm patient receive treatment . All participant trial due undergo first year course intravitreal injection anti-VEGF drug know ranibizumab . Those treatment arm , addition course injection , wear Noctura 400 Light Mask night 48 week . Those standard , control , arm receive course injection . The study involve 240 participant diagnose clinically significant DMO refer Hospital Eye Service ( HES ) injection . The current threshold referral central retinal thickening 400um great . Once HES , potential participant assess eligibility clinic . These eligibility test form future participant 's `` baseline visit '' . If eligible , patient invite participate study . The eligibility assessment require test require routine care pathway . After gain informed consent , eligible consent participant randomise either intervention arm ( wear Noctura 400 Light Mask night conjunction routine injection ) standard arm ( receive injection ) invite back clinic begin allocate therapy . At first trial visit , intervention arm give Noctura 400 Light Mask take away instruct use . The Noctura 400 power program last precisely 12 week . Participants provide replacement mask appropriate appointment ensure continuous treatment . At every appointment participant undergo Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) measurement ( assessment disease progression ) visual acuity ( VA ) test . For first three visit participant give intravitreal injection , follow , participant arm give injection appointment require base result OCT VA test . Medical history , concomitant medication adverse event record visit . At week 0,12 48 patient fill insomnia sleepiness quality life questionnaire . The Noctura 400 ability sense record use direct measure compliance . Sleep Mask data collect week 12,24,26 48 . If compliance low discuss participant aim increase compliance . If point trial Noctura 400 Light Mask appear faulty return analysis replace . The trial end patient 's last visit 48 week use . Participants return Noctura 400 Light Masks analysis patient arm free continue routine injection prescribe current care pathway . Participants make aware time consent Noctura 400 Light Mask available within NHS end trial , manufacturer intend device available purchase privately</detailed_description>
