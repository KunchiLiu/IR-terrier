	<criteria>Type subject : outpatient . Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Age : Subjects 40 year age old Visit 1 . Gender : Male female subject eligible participate study . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g. , age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . OR Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e. , accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen followup contact ) . Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g . 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ) ] . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . Severity Disease : A pre postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 &gt; =30 % &lt; =70 % predict normal value Visit 1 . Predicted value base upon ERS Global Lung Function Initiative Dyspnea : A score &gt; =2 Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( mMRC ) Visit 1 .

Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Any subject consider unlikely survive duration study period rapidly progress disease immediate lifethreatening illness ( e.g . cancer ) . In addition , subject condition ( e.g . neurological condition ) likely affect respiratory function include study . Severe Hepatic Impairment : Patients severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) exclude unless , opinion investigator , benefit likely outweigh risk . Moderate severe Renal Impairment : Patients moderate severe renal impairment ( e.g. , endstage renal disease require dialysis ) exclude , unless opinion investigator , benefit likely outweigh risk . Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : Longacting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMAs ) use caution subject severe cardiovascular disease .
