Participants satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion randomly assign 2:1:2 ratio one three treatment group ( arm ) : Group I ( guselkumab 100 mg dose regimen ) , Group II ( placebo crossover guselkumab Week 16 ) , Group III ( adalimumab standard psoriasis dose ) . All participant receive guselkumab every 8 week ( q8w ) Week 52 Week 148 ( open label treatment period ) . The end study define time last participant complete Week 160 visit . Participants primarily assess Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA ) Score 0 1 Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 90 Response Week 16 . The total duration study approximately 164 week ( include 4-week screening period ) . Participants monitor safety throughout study .</detailed_description>
