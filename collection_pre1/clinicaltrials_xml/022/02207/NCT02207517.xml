	<brief_summary>CITT-ART multicenter study ( 8 location around United States ) 324 child age 9 &lt; 14 year symptomatic convergence insufficiency ( CI ) . The purpose study see office-based therapy convergence insufficiency ( CI ) improve read ability attention . CI eye-teaming problem eye would like drift outward read close work . When eye drift , double vision happen . To prevent double vision one must use extra effort keep eye go . This extra effort cause symptom interfere read work comfortably near . These symptom often include eyestrain , blurred vision , headache , double vision , loss place read perform task near . In prior study find therapy improve symptom . In study look whether therapy improve read attention</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Office-based Vision Therapy Improving Reading Attention Children With Convergence Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following success NEI-funded Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trials ( CITT ) , next logical important research issue determine successful treatment symptomatic convergence insufficiency ( CI ) ( i.e. , improvement symptom ophthalmic sign ) impact function ( read attention ) . It well document child symptomatic CI report significantly symptoms read close work ( e.g. , blurred vision , headache , double vision , loss concentration , frequent loss place , trouble remember read ) , manifest academic-impairing behavior ( e.g. , difficulty finish assignment ) , score bad parent rating attention compare child normal binocular vision . Because reduction symptom adverse academic behavior establish outcomes successful treatment CI , propose test hypothesis resolution symptom behavior lead improved reading performance attention . Previous study find improvement read comprehension read speed accuracy successful treatment CI . In recent pilot study , investigator also find significant improvement read comprehension attention 16 week successful treatment symptomatic CI office-based vergence/accommodative therapy ; however , control group . To definitively determine whether successful treatment symptomatic CI positively impact read attention require placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial . Objective : We propose multicenter , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) 324 child age 9 &lt; 14 year ( Grades 3-8 ) symptomatic CI . [ restrict recruitment child significant single word read deficit . ] Participants randomize 16 week treatment either [ ] office-based vergence/accommodative therapy home reinforcement ( OBVAT ) [ b ] office-based placebo therapy home reinforcement ( OBPT ) . Outcomes ( read attention ) assess 16 week treatment . In addition , test long-term effect outcomes 1 year treatment completion . All analyse test null hypothesis difference outcomes two treatment group . Specific Aim 1 - Reading Performance : To compare read comprehension outcome child symptomatic CI receive 16 week OBVAT OBPT treatment . The primary outcome measure read performance Wechsler Individual Achievement test ( WIAT-III ) read comprehension subtest score . In secondary analysis , examine effect treatment word reading , pseudoword decoding , oral reading fluency , listen comprehension . We also examine correlation change CI symptom ophthalmic sign read outcomes . Analysis 1-year follow-up data use determine gain read performance observe 16 week treatment sustain . Specific Aim 2 - Attention : To investigate effect treatment teacher- parent-rated measure attention child symptomatic CI receive 16 week OBVAT OBPT intervention . The primary outcome measure attention score Strengths Weaknesses ADHD Symptoms Normal Behavior Scale ( SWAN ) . In secondary analysis , examine effect treatment second parent-rated attention scale call SNAP . We also examine correlation change CI-symptoms ophthalmic sign attention outcomes . Analysis 1-year follow-up data use determine gain attention observe 16 week treatment maintain . Scientific Clinical Impact : The relationship treatment symptomatic CI effect read attention child unknown . The result propose study contribute well understanding relationship help resolve controversy surround issue . The result important implication educator , psychologist , eye professional , health care provider care child read attention problem guide hypothesis development future scientific investigation evidence-based relationship visual disorder developmental disorder child .</detailed_description>
