	<brief_title>Low Dose IL-2 Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) T cell growth factor . IL-2 currently license treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma metastatic melanoma , promote expansion anti-cancer cytotoxic T cell natural killer ( NK ) cell . However low dos ( 100-times low use cancer therapy ) , IL-2 promote selective expansion regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) : immune modulating subset CD4+ lymphocytes . A recent phase 1 clinical trial collaborator Dana Farber Cancer Institute show low-dose IL-2 selectively expand Tregs patient treatment-resistant Graft v . Host Disease ( GvHD ) , low-dose IL-2 safe condition . A detailed immunological analysis sample study show low-dose IL-2 treatment associate increase Treg proliferation , increase de novo thymic generation Tregs , resolution defect intracellular signal apoptosis see Tregs chronic GvHD . A recent phase 1 study another group show low-dose IL-2 safe treatment HCV-associated vasculitis . Low-dose IL-2 also show well-tolerated subject HIV . Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory disease colon . Evidence pre-clinical model intestinal inflammation , also patient monogenetic defect Treg function , suggest Tregs play role prevention inflammation intestine . The treatment ( intervention ) study once-daily , subcutaneous injection IL-2 , total 8 week . The first 2 dos study drug administer research nurse Boston Children 's Hospital . Further dose self-administered , home . Training provide correct self-administration . This 3+3 dose escalation study IL-2 moderate-to-severe UC . This study design power identify MTD low-dose IL-2 UC . Once MTD identify , 10 subject receive IL-2 dose . Recruitment 2 28 patient plan . Dose level base experience collaborator GvHD . In addition determine MTD , study determine low-dose IL-2 safe well-tolerated patient moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis . A detailed immunological analysis sample obtain study determine low-dose IL-2 expands Tregs vivo , patient moderate-to-severe UC . Immunological change correlate clinical response . The study take place Boston Children 's Hospital . The study involve 10 study visit . Most study visit involve blood test . A flexible sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy perform part screen process . A flexible sigmoidoscopy also perform completion therapy , determine clinical response . The first two subject receive study drug admit overnight follow first dose . Subsequent dos administer out-patient basis . All subject receive IL-2 out-patient basis . Responders ( acceptable side-effect profile ) allow continue study drug least 1 year . Compensation provide participant .</detailed_description>
