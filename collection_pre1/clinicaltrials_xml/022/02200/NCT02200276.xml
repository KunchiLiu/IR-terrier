	<brief_summary>The immune system part body protect infection . The immune system often n't work effectively people get old . This research do find immune system old people age 75 respond influenza vaccine ( flu shot ) . We also want find chronic cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection , common virus infection old person affect immune response people older 75 year age receive flu shot . The Flu Shot vaccine approve prevention influenza ( `` Flu '' ) infection recommend every year persons 50 year old . People older 75 year age consider healthy frail may join . A total 525 person participate study . In order determine qualify study , would ask answer question phone take approximately 5 minute . If qualify agree proceed , ask come Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center , unable come Bayview , one staff visit home . During visit obtain consent , review medical history , measure vital sign , walk speed grip strength . We also administer brief questionnaire collect urine blood sample . We give Flu shot free . Three four week receive Flu shot , another visit Johns Hopkins Bayview home repeat questionnaire , vital sign , collect second blood sample . Throughout study , call week ask general health Flu-like symptom . These call make throughout Flu season typically last end May . If begin influenza like symptom time study , ask call office report symptom may perform nasal swab confirm influenza , third blood draw look immune response protection influenza vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza Immunization Adults Over Age 75</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seasonal influenza cause significant morbidity mortality fourth lead cause death old Americans . Annual immunization trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) recommend adult 50 year old . However , despite improve vaccination coverage old adult time , influenza-related mortality actually increase . While many TIV study indicate benefit older adult whole , study lack representation old frail subset elderly suffer three-quarters influenza-related mortality . Our pilot study fund Beeson K23 award show significant vaccine failure antibody response TIV clinical protection frail elderly . Our preliminary data also suggest chronic cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection define presence CMV viral DNA peripheral monocyte use highly sensitive specific nest PCR-based assay develop laboratory , rather anti-CMV IgG serology , associate poor antibody T-cell responses TIV immunization well poor clinical protection . This likely anti-CMV IgG serology , conventional diagnostic measure chronic CMV infection , crude measure merely indicate prior exposure CMV distinguish chronic ( persistent ) past ( resolve ) infection . Mechanistically , precipitous immune functional decline observe 75 chronic CMV infection may contribute significantly age-related immune senescent remodeling , term immunosenescence . In order improve assessment effectiveness TIV immunization understand risk factor underlie immune mechanism determine vaccine failure adult age 75 , frail , old old adult subset , study design conduct prospective , 4-year TIV immunization post-vaccination influenza surveillance adult 75 year . We first assess chronic CMV infection define detectable CMV DNA peripheral blood monocyte frailty status study participant administer Fluzone High-Dose TIV vaccine . Influenza-like illness ( ILI ) case identify post-vaccination influenza surveillance previously do Beeson project respiratory specimen obtain ILI case test use cut edge PCR-based IBIS assay accurately subtype influenza respiratory virus laboratory Dr. Charlotte Gaydos Division Infectious Disease , co-investigator project . Strain-specific antibody response TIV immunization measure standard hemogglutination inhibition ( HI ) assay . We also evaluate T-cell response influenza virus baseline TIV immunization . Taken together , study provide accurate assessment clinical effectiveness TIV immunization real world geriatric population age 75 underlying humoral cell-mediated immune mechanism . Moreover , investigate role chronic CMV infection define presence CMV viral DNA peripheral monocyte risk factor vaccine failure elderly age 75 . Because old old subset grow rapidly number great risk influenza-related morbidity mortality . The long-term goal research strengthen immune protection influenza vulnerable old Americans effective target immunization strategy well possibly prevention mitigation chronic CMV infection .</detailed_description>
