	<brief_summary>Being able accurately monitor patient bodily fluid level surgery important , number complication arise patient 's fluid level become unbalanced , swell within pressure various bodily organ system . There several different way physician monitor patient 's fluid balance surgery , measure amount urine output use central venous catheter measure pressure vein enter heart . Most technique invasive since require tube insert body . A potential alternative would use noninvasive technique electrical bioimpedance ( BIA ) . Bioimpedance assessment work use small electrical current accurately predict water surround outside cell body , well total amount water entire body . Electrical bioimpedance assessment use estimate patient swell follow surgery ( edema ) , measure volume blood heart pumping , well calculate body fat percentage . The goal study relate technology fluid shift within body occur result surgery , particular , major intra-abdominal surgery . By use bioimpedance surgery , investigator compare data collect calculate use traditional measure body fluid status , urine output intraoperative blood loss . During study , bioimpedance monitor replace standard bodily fluid monitor interfere reading . Additionally , electrical current produce bioimpedance monitor small patient feel interfere medical device pacemaker .</brief_summary>
