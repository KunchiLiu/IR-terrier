	<brief_title>Attention Bias Modification Anxiety : A Randomized Control Trial With Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder common psychiatric diagnosis , affect many 29 % people lifetime . In addition devastate personal cost anxiety , yearly economic cost society estimate around $ 46.6 billion U.S. Empirically-based treatment anxiety improve recent year , barrier access , side effect , high remission rate ( ~50 % ) suggest need complementary treatment . Computer-based attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) , brief , cost-effective , easy administer , target key mechanism pathological anxiety - threat bias , exaggerated attention fear threatening stimulus . Two decade research show reduce threat bias via computerized ABMT also reduce anxiety severity level comparable gold-standard treatment . Despite promise , randomize clinical trial ( RCTs ) evaluate specific mechanism underlie ABMT 's effect anxiety , identified predictor treatment response . Therefore , remain unclear ABMT effective , limit clinical translation . This study randomize clinical trial use highly sensitive measure neurocognitive functioning delineate key mechanism emerge treatment anxiety . Specifically , study use scalp-recorded event-related potential ( ERPs ) elucidate neurocognitive process implicate attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) predict treatment response . Researchers recruit 90 anxious patient engage study pursue follow three specific aim : Aim 1 examine relation neural behavioral response threat prior ABMT . Researchers test whether great behavioral threat bias associate ERP response indicate great attention capture threat ( large P1 P2 ERPs ) , reduce top-down control attention threat ( small N2 , N2pc , P3 ERPs ) . Aim 2 examine effect ABMT ERPs threat , threat bias , anxiety . Analyses focus whether ABMT relative placebo training result great reduction automatic attention capture and/or control attention threat measure via ERPs . Aim 3 examine relation ERP responses threat reduction threat bias anxiety . Researchers test whether post-training neural change , specify Aim 2 , associate reduction behavioral threat bias anxiety severity . These predicted relation , together test Aim 2a , support utility ERPs neural marker specific cognitive process underlie ABMT efficacy . Researchers also explore whether ERP measure great attention capture and/or reduce control attention threat baseline predict treatment response , help identify patient benefit ABMT . Through innovative combination highly sensitive neurocognitive measure RCT design , proposal aim delineate core neurocognitive response threat mechanism remediation anxiety . Confirmation study hypothesis would , ultimately , accelerate pace development biologically-informed , accessible , targeted intervention anxiety .</detailed_description>
