	<brief_summary>The aims national population-based study Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) include : ( 1 ) understand overall prevalence ASD child age 6-12 year 8 city ( n=120,000 ) , ( 2 ) explore environmental genetic risk factor associate ASD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study multicenter , cross-sectional study involing eight city . The program include prevalence study risk factor analysis . 1 . Prevalence study ASD To estimate national prevalence ASD Chinese pediatric population age 6-12 year . 1.1 . Target population This 4-year study initiate year 2013 eight city China . For city , 3 community different economic level choose include child bear within Jan 2001 Dec 2007 ( age 6-12 year screen ) local residency live community 6 month . The ASD child attend special education school meet inclusion criterion also include prevalence estimation . 1.2 . Sample size Based previous regional study , plan recruit approx.15 , 000 subject city ( average . 5,000 subject community ) , 120,000 subject total comprise national study sample . The plan update , base prevalence obtain pilot study . 1.3 . Screening diagnosis The screen tool choose Autism Spectrum Rating Scale ( ASRS ) SRS（Social Responsiveness Scale） pilot study.The questionnaire parent-administered form take approximately 15-20 minute complete . Parents recruied child invite complete questionnaire . Parents questionnaire screen-positive child contact appoint diagnostic evaluation . Children whose parent could reach classified non-responders . The DSM-Ⅳ , ADI-R ADOS ( ADI-R : Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised , ADOS : Autism Diagnosis Observation Scales ) use diagnostic evaluation . Co-morbidities , epilepsy ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ) aditional medical examination , EEG ( electroencephalogram ) , head circumference , anthropometrics , allergy , sleep pattern , etc . 2 . Risk Factors study ASD A classic case-control design apply explore risk factor ASD . 2.1 . Study subject 2.1.1 . Cases control Cases child live target community identify positive base questionnaire screen subsequent diagnosis DSM-Ⅳ , ADOS ADI-R. Controls child screen negative matched case age , gender , class . 2.2 . Environmental pollutant exposure Given hypothesis environmental factor might play role etiology ASD , analyze biological sample subject investigate environmental exposure include chronic lead exposure , pesticides exposure , endocrine disruptors exposure , , hair , blood , urine collect case control . The detailed protocol measurement kind biological sample introduce everywhere ( see reference individual block ) . 2.3 . Analysis potential risk factor This study also analyze association onset ASD risk factor , include diet ( ) , live environment ( ) , perinatal characteristic parent , feed history , baby growth development birth use questionnaire review medical record . 2.4 . Genetic analysis We go use target area capture technology develop HiSeq2000 , second generation high throughput sequence platform , carry molecular diagnosis screening ( monogenic disease ) . Also , screen Trio ASD-related genetic mutation high credibility occur frequently classify ASDs accord definite etiologies.Furthermore , continue study distribution ASD relevant gene mutation among patient China , lay solid foundation study molecular epidemiology.Meanwhile , also apply genome-wide sequence technology positive case find new mutation might serve potential molecular marker facilitate diagnosis treatment ASDs . A pilot study involve 4 city ( n=400 , total n &gt; =1600 ) conduct test methodology apply prevalence study . A diagnostic study perform evalute performance ASRS SRS screen ASD , one apply main study .</detailed_description>
