	<brief_summary>The commonly use noninvasive respiratory support preterm baby Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) , provide extra breathe support baby breathe ) . Increasingly High flow Nasal Cannula ( HFNC , new form extra breathe support ) therapy find way clinical practice despite lack good physiological data . There also concern potential generate high pressure airway cause distension lung . We would like find effect HFNC - 1 . Airway pressure various flow rate comparison CPAP . - 2 . Breathing marker include respiratory rate ( speed breathing ) , oxygen carbon dioxide level , tidal volume ( much air breathe breath ) airway wash ( wash waste gas airway ) . We plan study 15 baby three different weight category support either CPAP HFNC . The airway pressure , oxygen carbon dioxide concentration airway measure small plastic catheter ( similar feeding tube much short length ) , carbon dioxide level skin sensor , fast much baby breathe special vest apply like layer clothing . These record HFNC CPAP . There blood test invasive procedure involve . The baby monitor throughout study period approximately two hour experience registrar train use study device . This study improve understand physiological effect HFNC lead good care preterm baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Respiratory Physiology During High Flow Nasal Cannula Treatment Preterm Neonates .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose design Design : Prospective randomise crossover study . Purpose : - Raising airway pressure one important intervention disposal clinician treat patient respiratory failure . In premature infant Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) High Flow Nasal Cannula ( HFNC ) noninvasive technique raise mean airway pressure intubation require . It clear clinician choose technique little data compare physiological effect treatment . - A composite physiological assessment baby HFNC CPAP treatment require understand HFNC work . It important answer question understand best use HFNC baby . - This proposal design provide information physiological effect therapy population baby across different weight category . The study protocol involve use HFNC device currently use neonatal unit . Interventions : 1 . A small plastic catheter tip transducer ( Gaeltec ) place upper breathing passage ( nasopharynx oropharynx ) use standard method . From measure airway pressure respiratory gas concentration . The catheter remove soon study complete . This procedure do study . 2 . Breathing marker ( Tidal breathe index ) measure non invasive method use Volusense method vest apply chest abdomen like layer clothing . The Volusense vest remove soon procedure . This process do study . 3 . Blood carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) level measure non invasive transcutaneous sensor apply skin ( Tosca Radiometer ) . This skin sensor remove soon study complete . 1 . The baby must clinically stable precede 12 hour noninvasive breathe support ( meet exit criterion ) . The baby randomise either group 1 ( CPAP first follow HFNC ) group 2 ( HFNC first follow CPAP ) computerise software programme . 2 . The measuring device namely nasopharyngeal catheter , Volusense vest transcutaneous CO2 sensor place per standard method . 3 . After ensure baby ' clinical stability measurement record HFNC gas flow rate range 2 litres 8 litre per minute CPAP 6 cm water pressure level . 4 . The study last 2 hour . The baby spend 10 minute HFNC flow rate level 30 minute equilibration period support change HFNC CPAP . 5 . Routine measurement heart rate , respiratory rate oxygen saturation do per standard neonatal practice . The data record electronically analysis total study duration around 120 minute . 6 . Respiratory support terminate point clinically indicate . The researcher experience neonatal registrar directly observe baby throughout study . Measurements would discontinue pre set exit criterion note . Statistics : A total 45 baby ( 15 baby weight category : &lt; 1000 gram , 1001500 gram &gt; 1500 gram ) study .</detailed_description>
