	<brief_summary>This multi-centre study provide sound , generalizable data effectiveness POC-based algorithm determine extent guideline reduce blood product transfusion . Investigators study outcomes 7000 patient undergoing heart surgery 10 participating hospital . The propose trial address several important research clinical issue potential markedly improve transfusion management surgical care general cardiac surgery patient . The intervention novel POC-based algorithm show pilot study u associate substantial reduction blood product transfusion . The algorithm employ viscoelastic aggregometric POC-tests objective measure blood loss . The primary outcome avoidance red blood cell transfusion hospitalization . The study 90 % power detect 12 % increase avoidance rate . Secondary outcome include avoidance red blood cell use blood product ( plasma , platelet , cryoprecipitate ) , unit blood product transfuse , adverse clinical outcome relate transfusion ( acute kidney injury , infection , death ) . Data also collect future health-economics analysis . Largely due limitation exist evidence , however , algorithms rarely used clinical practice . The propose trial provide sound , generalizable data effectiveness POC-based algorithm guide future use . An integrated blood management algorithm employ POC coagulation test reduce blood product transfusion cardiac surgery , thereby improve clinical outcome . Does integrate blood transfusion algorithm employ POC coagulation test apply across network hospital reduce blood transfusion associate adverse outcome cardiac surgery ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite major advance cardiac surgery , coagulopathy continue carry heavy burden case require use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , occur frequently result excessive blood loss , blood product transfusion , adverse clinical outcome . Current management coagulopathy hamper inability conventional laboratory test delineate etiology timely manner , thereby preclude timely target transfusion therapy . With advent point-of-care ( POC ) coagulation test rapidly identify etiology coagulopathy , may possible reduce burden coagulopathy thereby reduce transfusion adverse outcomes . Several single-centre study ( include one investigator group ) find use POC-based algorithm cardiac surgery markedly reduce blood product transfusion mean reduce morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
