	<criteria>For Phase I : Locally advance metastatic BRAF V600E/K/R positive melanoma either treatmentna√Øve treatmentexperienced . For latter , progression , stable best response , intolerance last treatment require . Previous treatment local systemic therapy . There limit number prior therapy . For patient , disease measurable must evaluable , define one lesion know present , measure . eg : Bony lesion , pleural effusion , ascites . For Phase I : For treatmentexperienced patient , follow washout period require prior enrollment study : 2 week wash prior local therapy ( radiation therapy intralesional therapy ) , 4 week wash cytotoxic therapy high dose interleukin2 , 6 week wash antiPD1 antiPDL1 therapy . For therapy mention , wash period least 5 half life need . For phase II : Histological diagnosis BRAF V600E/K melanoma , unresectable stage III stage IV , accord AJCC Staging Manual , 7th Edition , 2011 . Must measurable disease , prior systemic treatment locally advance metastatic melanoma . Previous local therapy allow . Previous systemic treatment stage III disease subsequently render NED ( evidence disease ) surgery allow except ipilimumab BRAF inhibitor . Patients resectable disease want surgery reason also allow . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure two dimension diameter great 1.0cm . For CT/MRI evaluation , effective slice thickness require less equal 5 mm . For slice thickness great 5mm , diameter must great equal 2.0cm baseline . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential within 7 day start study treatment . Lab test result accordance protocol WBC greater/equal 2,000/mm3 ANC greater/equal 1200/mm3 Platelet greater/equal 1000,000/mm2 Hemoglobin greater/equal 9 gm/dL ( may transfuse ) Serum bilirubin level less/equal 1.5 mg/dL except patient Gilbert 's syndrome . Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) less/equal 2.5 X upper limit normal Alkaline phosphatase less/equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum Creatinine level less/equal 1.5 mg/dL Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) great equal low limit normal ECHO Women childbearing potential advise avoid become pregnant men advise father child receive treatment ipilimumab dabrafenib . Patients agree use appropriate method birth control study . Age great 18 year gender race . Able provide inform consent sign approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline . Concurrent therapy nonprotocol anticancer therapy Prior systemic treatment either ipilimumab BRAF inhibitor ( vemurafenib dabrafenib ) . Prior local therapy within 2 week ( phase I II ) prior systemic therapy within 4 week start protocol treatment ( phase I ) . For phase II : Any prior systemic therapy locally advance metastatic melanoma . Prior local therapy radiation intratumoral injection allow . Previous systemic treatment stage III disease subsequently render NED ( evidence disease ) surgery allow . Brain metastasis ( except know lesion previously treat surgery stereotactic radiosurgery lesion , still present , confirm stable great equal 2 week prior enrollment , asymptomatic corticosteroid requirement great equal week prior randomization , enzyme induce anticonvulsant great equal 2 week prior randomization ) . Brain MRI CT require screening . Anyone second malignancy expect require cytotoxic chemotherapy immune modulate therapy within 3 month enrollment Preexisting autoimmunity : History inflammatory bowel disease ; history symptomatic autoimmune disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre Syndrome ) . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . No concurrent systemic corticosteroid ( systemic immunosuppressant 's ) , include oral steroid ( i.e . prednisone , dexamethasone ) , continuous use topical steroid cream ointment , ophthalmologic steroid . If subject currently take corticosteroid , treatment discontinue two week prior start protocol therapy . Occasional use steroid inhaler allow . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation , study drug administration , would impair ability subject receive protocol therapy . Any known positive test hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus indicate acute chronic infection . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Herbal remedy ( e.g. , St. John 's wort ) within 1 week enrollment . Drugs strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A CYP2C8 , pglycoprotein ( Pgp ) Bcrp transporter may alter dabrafenib concentration . The list may modify base emerge data ; consider therapeutic substitution medication . Patients must treatment least 1 week prior enrollment . A history know glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency . The presence medical psychiatric disorder , opinion treat physician , would contraindicate use drug protocol place subject undue risk treatment complication Pregnancy breast feed A history severe hypersensitivity reaction ipilimumab dabrafenib Any reason , opinion investigator , patient participate</criteria>
