	<criteria>1 . Age 5 &lt; 17 year 2 . Amblyopia associate strabismus , anisometropia , ( previously treat untreated ) 1 . Criteria strabismus : At least one follow must meet : Presence heterotropia examination distance near fixation ( without spectacle ) Documented history strabismus longer present ( judgment investigator could cause amblyopia ) 2 . Criteria anisometropia : At least one follow criterion must meet : ≥0.50 D difference eye spherical equivalent ≥1.50 D difference eye astigmatism meridian 3 . Criteria combinedmechanism amblyopia : Both follow criterion must meet : Criteria strabismus meet ( see ) ≥1.00 D difference eye spherical equivalent OR ≥1.50 D difference eye astigmatism meridian Note : spherical equivalent requirement differs definition refractive/anisometropic amblyopia 3 . No amblyopia treatment past 2 week ( patch , atropine , Bangerter , vision therapy ) 4 . Refractive correction ( spectacle contact lenses , applicable ) must meet follow criterion enrollment base cycloplegic refraction 7 month old . 1 . Requirements Correction Refractive Error : 1 . For subject meet criterion strabismic ( ) amblyopia ( see 2.2.1 # 2 ) : • Hypermetropia , correct , must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus sphere must symmetric two eye . 2 . For subject meet criterion anisometropic combinedmechanism amblyopia ( see 2.2.1 # 2 ) : Spherical equivalent must within 0.50 D fully correct anisometropia Hypermetropia must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus must symmetric two eye Cylinder power eye must within 0.50 D fully correct astigmatism Cylinder axis eye must within 6 degree axis cycloplegic refraction cylinder power ≥1.00 D 2 . Refractive correction meet criterion must wear either : 16 week Until visual acuity amblyopic eye stable ( defined 2 consecutive visual acuity measurement test method least 4 week apart &lt; 1 line change ( &lt; 5 letter EETDRS ) ) 3 . Monocular binocular contact lens wear allow provide contact lenses meet refractive requirement corneal plane . The form correction must wear throughout entire study study procedure ( i.e. , change contact spectacle patch gameplaying study test ) . Safety glass require subject wear contact lens , investigator encourage suggest safety glass wear contact lens . 5 . Visual acuity , measure eye without cycloplegia current refractive correction ( applicable ) within 7 day prior randomization use ATSHOTV visual acuity protocol child &lt; 7 year EETDRS visual acuity protocol child ≥ 7 year studyapproved device display single surround optotypes , follow : 1 . Visual acuity amblyopic eye 20/40 20/200 inclusive ( 33 72 letter EETDRS ) 2 . Visual acuity fellow eye 20/25 better ( ≥ 78 letter EETDRS ) 3 . Interocular difference ≥ 3 logMAR line ( ≥ 15 letter EETDRS ) ( i.e. , amblyopiceye acuity least 3 logMAR line bad felloweye acuity ) 6 . Heterotropia heterophoria total near deviation ≤ 10∆ ( measure PACT ) . 7 . Ability align nonius cross binocular game system ( angle ocular deviation &gt; 10∆ would require nonius cross adjust extent playing game would compromise ) . 8 . Subject able play Hess Falling Blocks game study iPad® ( easy set ) binocular condition ( redgreen glass ) , demonstrate score least 1 line office . 9 . Investigator willing prescribe computer game play patch per protocol . 10 . Parent understand protocol willing accept randomization . 11 . Parent phone ( access phone ) willing contact Jaeb Center staff . 12 . Relocation outside area active PEDIG site study within next 16 week anticipate . A subject exclude follow reason : 1 . Prism refractive correction time enrollment ( eligible prism discontinue 2 week prior enrollment ) . 2 . Myopia great 6.00D spherical equivalent either eye . 3 . Previous intraocular refractive surgery . 4 . Any treatment amblyopia ( patch , atropine , Bangerter filter , vision therapy ) past 2 week . Previous amblyopia therapy allow regardless type , must discontinue least 2 week immediately prior enrollment . 5 . Ocular comorbidity may reduce visual acuity determine ocular examination perform within past 7 month ( Note : nystagmus per se exclude subject visual acuity criterion meet ) . 6 . No Down syndrome cerebral palsy 7 . No severe developmental delay would interfere treatment evaluation ( opinion investigator ) . Subjects mild speech delay read and/or learn disability exclude . 8 . Heterotropia heterophoria total ocular deviation &gt; 10∆ ( phoria plus tropia &gt; 10∆ ) near ( measure PACT ) .</criteria>
