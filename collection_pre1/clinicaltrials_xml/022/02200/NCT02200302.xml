	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) common disorder unknown etiology vertebra disc gradually develop curvature first detect patient 11 20 year age . The deformity 3-dimensional , coronal curve measure radiographs Cobb angle . The Cobb angle measurement scoliosis represent sum angular wedge vertebra disc superior inferior end vertebra . Although small curve well tolerated require treatment , large curve progress point cosmetically unacceptable , interfere chest wall mechanic , produce cardiac pulmonary compromise . The natural history AIS apparently include 2 stage : initiation curve subsequent progression . The factor responsible initiation curve unknown , subsequent progression curve clearly associate adolescent growth spurt . The primary risk factor progression include age onset magnitude curve ; young patient large curve high risk . Although numerous treatment method recommend patient AIS , accept treatment include brace skeletally immature patient curve 25 40 degree operative correction spinal fusion patient curve great 45 degree . For many teenager , cosmetic social concern associate bracing cause compliance problem wear brace many patient wear brace home . While operative intervention completely correct scoliosis rib hump , eliminate segmental spinal motion , concentrate stress end fusion potentially leading disc degeneration back pain . Despite satisfactory short-term result operative instrumentation fusion , less invasive technique preserve motion small scar represent major improvement . Realizing goal contingent treat curve early , progress irreversible deformity , still enough residual growth remodel potential . ApiFix Ltd develop novel implant less invasive treatment AIS . The MID-C system design correct deformity step step along period time , give skeletal soft tissue time accommodate incremental correction . The MID-C System inherent benefit : - Only two screw use - Incision size much small - Simpler operation shorter operative time - Less complication ( attribute three point ) . - Minimal spinal mobility loss . All device component make material well accept orthopedic field fully biocompatible ( see Investigator Brochure ) . The unique concept system material use may provide favorable result follow : Smaller scare , quicker heal period well spine mobility year . This study design demonstrate MID-C System safe effective .</brief_summary>
