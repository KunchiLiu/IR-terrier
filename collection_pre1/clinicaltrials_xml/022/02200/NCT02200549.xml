	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) ，the fourth lead cause death world , represent important public health challenge . It also major cause chronic morbidity , mortality disability throughout world , lead heavy social economic burden . For long time , treatment COPD mainly focus drug therapy . Recently , pulmonary rehabilitation recognize core component management individual chronic respiratory disease , clearly demonstrate reduce dyspnea , increase exercise capacity , improve quality life . Exercise training , widely regard cornerstone pulmonary rehabilitation , one best available mean improve muscle function COPD.The commonly form cycle training . Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) adjunct exercise training additional benefit inspiratory muscle strength , endurance exercise capacity patient COPD . There insufficient evidence demonstrate great benefit combine inspiratory muscle training cycle training . This study evaluate effect combine inspiratory muscle training cycle training patient COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Combined Cycle Training Inspiratory Muscle Training Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient COPD participate rehabilitation program 8 week . Participants propose study randomly program one three intervention group : 1 . Cycle train program alone ( perform calibrate stationary cycle ergometer ) . 2 . Combined cycle train inspiratory muscle training ( perform calibrate stationary cycle ergometer threshold loading device ) . 3 . Neither cycle training inspiratory muscle training .</detailed_description>
