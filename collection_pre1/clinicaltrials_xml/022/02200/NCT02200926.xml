	<brief_summary>The previous study use slow load breathe device breathe training ( Jones et al. , 2010 ) . It show slow load breathe training reduce rest blood pressure heart rate essential hypertensive patient . However , study elderly essential isolate systolic hypertensive patient . Not high prevalence hypertension Thailand find elderly also physiological change elderly cause interest special population . It many advantage use slow load breathe train elderly people . Firstly , low technology easily implement home . Secondly , practice almost anytime anywhere . Thirdly , orthopedic complication slow load breathe training minimal . Finally , slow load breathe training may enhance cardiopulmonary function fitness trait , scope study . Moreover , slow load breathe exercise result metabolic adaptation skeletal muscle , forearm , train . If slow load breathe training modified central component pressor reflex pathway way single muscle training might work , suggest , load breathing training would modulate effect pressor response muscle train . We , therefore , aim study effect slow load breathe train use Breathmax blood pressure rest exercise elderly essential isolate systolic hypertension also investigate autonomic function others may involve change blood pressure elderly essential isolate systolic hypertension . We hypothesize slow load unloaded breathing training could reduce rest exercise blood pressure elderly essential isolate systolic hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject train blood pressure heart rate measurement home use digital arm blood pressure monitor 2 week control period start breathe training . After 2 week , subject breathe train group train inspire deeply resistance set use Breathmax load 18 centimeter water ( cmH2O ) 0 cmH2O ( resistance ) breathe frequency control 6 breaths/minute load breathing ( LB ) unload breathing ( ULB ) group , respectively . They rest 5 second every 6 deep breathing . Breathing pattern control duty cycle 0.4 ( inspiratory time = 4 sec total respiratory time = 10 sec ) . The paced breathing practice use metronome laboratory subject independently without metronome . The breathing perform normally control group ( C ) . The training program perform home 30 minutes/day , 7 days/week 8 week . After 8 week breathe training , sustainability breathe train effect assess . Subjects breathe training group ( LB ULB ) stop breathe training Breathmax change breathe normally . In contrast subject control group , divide 2 subgroup . The first subgroup perform loaded breathing training load 18 cmH2O . The another subgroup perform unloaded breathing training load 0 cmH2O . Breathing frequency control 6 breaths/minute subgroup . The training program perform home 30 minutes/day , 7 days/week 8 week . Data collection carry 4 time : ( 1 ) control , ( 2 ) training , ( 3 ) training ( 4 ) stop training . All measurement do cardiovascular laboratory room , department physical therapy , faculty associate medical science . In addition , self measurement blood pressure heart rate conduct home every morning get time throughout study ( week 0 18 ) .</detailed_description>
