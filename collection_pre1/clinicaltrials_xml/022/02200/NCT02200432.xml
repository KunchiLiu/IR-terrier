	<detailed_description>To maximize patient perspective effectively support lifestyle choice , develop `` Patient Experience Recommender System Persuasive Communication Tailoring . '' PERSPeCT adaptive computer system assess patient 's individual perspective , understand patient 's preference health message , provide personalize , persuasive health communication relevant individual patient . Investigators propose overcome key weakness exist top-down expert-driven health communication intervention apply advanced machine learn algorithms adaptively recommend message base `` collective intelligence '' thousand patient . This work leverage paradigm-shifting `` Web 2.0 '' approach adaptive personalization potential broad impact field computer tailor health communication ( CTHC ) . Using knowledge scientific expert , current CTHC intervention collect baseline patient `` profile '' use expert-written , rule-based system target message subsets patient . These market segmentation intervention show promise help certain patient reach lifestyle goal . Although theoretically sound , rule-based system may account socio-cultural concept intrinsic importance target population , thus limit relevance . Further , rule adapt patient feedback . Outside healthcare , company like Google , Amazon , Netflix Pandora make extensive use adaptive recommendation system provide content enhance personal relevance . These system use machine learning algorithms derive personalize recommendation variety data source include preference feedback collect individual user . Within scope Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) pilot , investigator address challenge adapt machine learn recommender system CTHC specific context patient decision support smoke cessation . Investigators choose domain smoking major preventable cause death , exist database 1,000 persuasive message develop current federal grant ( R01 CA129091 ) . Specific study aim : Aim 1 : Collect Explicit Feedback data order train PERSPeCT Recruit 700 smoker use multiple , complimentary strategy , use web interface , ask smoker provide ( ) Perspectives smoke quit socio-cultural context information ( b ) Ratings influential aspect smoke cessation message . Aim 2 : Design , Implement Validate customize recommendation framework This involve ( ) develop implement machine learn recommender system integrate patient profile , message metadata , web site view influence rating , ( b ) training model validate predictive performance . Aim 3 : Conduct pilot randomize trial ( n = 120 smoker ) PERSPeCT . Investigators hypothesize PERSPeCT system ( H1 ) Select message increase influence smoker provide message rating ( H2 ) Select message good influence rule-based CTHC system smoker provide sufficient number rating CTHC system support patient decision behavior , lifestyle , choice . PERSPeCT address area interest PCORI , namely : 1 ) Identifying , test , and/or evaluate method use assess patient perspective researching behavior , lifestyle , choice within patient 's control ; 2 ) Developing , refining , test , and/or evaluate patient-centered approach , include decision support tool . The study team uniquely position accomplish ambitious aim within scope PCORI pilot investigator utilize exist database persuasive message previous study , two year data effectiveness message trans-disciplinary team expertise health communication , web system engineering , machine learn recommender system .</detailed_description>
