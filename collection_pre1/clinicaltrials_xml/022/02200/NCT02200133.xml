	<detailed_description>This randomize study compare personalize Survivorship Care Plan ( SCP ) template usual care ( SCP ) . The investigator hypothesize personalize SCP incorporate patient specific treatment exposure provide framework long term followup base exposure subsequent risk late complication enhance patient survivorship confidence knowledge , increase adherence recommend healthcare , improve health behavior reduce hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) - relate emotional distress . The randomized study design able evaluate efficacy individualize SCP enhance transplant survivor knowledge , health behavior health care utilization recommend preventive care . Most transplant center use standardized SCP HCT recipient , hence , control arm would represent prevalent standard care ( e.g. , discharge summary , provider-to-provider communication ) . Transplant center participate study represent spectrum center type ( e.g. , geographic location , center volume , resource infrastructure ) patient population ( e.g. , healthcare disparity , urban/rural population , distance transplant center ) . Usual care center document time determine center eligibility . The study principal investigator , consultation protocol team , make determination center eligibility review center `` usual care '' procedure . In order avoid contamination study intervention , center ask change follow-up practice period enrol patient study . The primary objective investigator study evaluate impact individualize SCP survivor knowledge past diagnostic treatment detail , confidence knowledge prevention treatment late-effects , access resource familial risk cancer . For objective , investigator compare change score Confidence Survivorship Information instrument baseline 6 month study intervention . Secondary objective investigate influence individualize SCP standardized measure HCT relate distress , knowledge recommend care , health behavior , self-efficacy , health care utilization .</detailed_description>
