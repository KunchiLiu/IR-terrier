	<brief_summary>Household air pollution cook stoves use solid fuel dominate total population air pollution exposure . Females young child disproportionately affect either perform present majority cooking activity . Worldwide , household air pollution responsible 1.6 million premature death annually , largely secondary respiratory tract infection , 2.7 % worldwide disability-adjusted life year . Children survive childhood free disease ; WHO estimate 35 % COPD case worldwide secondary household air pollution . Reducing female infant morbidity mortality relate household air pollution secondary biomass smoke exposure top-priority public health goal . We hypothesize utero biomass smoke exposure result fetal oxidant imbalance , negatively impact lung development . We leverage success Ghana Randomized Air Pollution Health Study , randomize cook stove intervention trial 1,415 mother-infant pair , examine impact maternal household air pollution exposure cord blood oxidant imbalance infant pulmonary function . We aim enroll least 150 infant , analyze cord blood sample marker oxidant imbalance perform infant pulmonary function test . Cord blood also prepared future immune , hormonal epigenetic testing . This study allow u consider intervention , maternal antioxidant dietary supplementation pregnancy , compliment exist cook stove intervention reduce household air pollution-related morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study nest within Ghana Randomized Air Pollution Health Study ( GRAPHS ) investigate oxidant imbalance pulmonary function infant expose utero household air pollution . GRAPHS birth cohort study examine impact reduce maternal household air pollution exposure birth outcome incident infant pneumonia . Mother-infant pair recruit Kintampo Health Research Centre ( KHRC ) catchment area rural Ghana , comprise population 146,000 people . 1,415 nonsmoking woman primarily deliver one four KHRC birth facility pregnant singleton fetus gestational age le 24 week eligible participation . After enrollment , woman randomize no-emission liquid petroleum gas ( LPG ) stove , low-emission BioLite cook stove control ( high-emission ) arm undergo four 72-hour carbon monoxide ( CO ) and/or particulate matter ( PM ) prenatal exposure monitoring session . Birth weight outcomes record placenta sample store formalin future analysis . The infant follow CO PM exposure monitoring session 1 , 3 9 month age weekly surveillance incident respiratory disease . For propose study , recruit consent GRAPHS mother-infant pair . Venous cord blood placenta sample collect follow placenta delivery . Cord blood place IsoRack cool pack design maintain sample 0°C 6 hour . Cord blood sample process biomarkers oxidant imbalance future study , include limited immune function , hormonal balance epigenetic analysis . After initial processing , sample freeze -80°C oxidant analysis perform use commercially available reagent kit protocol . When infant one month old young , train study personnel perform noninvasive pulmonary function test ( PFT ) use Medispirit Whistler Lung Function Measurement Instrument ( LFMI ) accordance ATS/ERS guideline . The Medispirit Whistler LFMI lightweight portable device allow non-invasive PFTs perform infant 's home . The Whistler LFMI flow measurement ultrasonic therefore need calibrate . The infant hold his/her head stable position s/he breathe quietly asleep . A sterile , single-use , transparent facemask interfere normal breathing place infant 's mouth nose . Tidal flow volume loop record single occlusion test use determine ratio time reach peak expiratory flow total expiratory time , compliance resistance .</detailed_description>
