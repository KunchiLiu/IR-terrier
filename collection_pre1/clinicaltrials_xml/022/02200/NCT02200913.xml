	<brief_title>Effects Core Stabilization Exercise Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) common musculoskeletal complaint . In LBPs , benign disappears within six week , approximately 20 % individual LBP show improvement condition , may progress chronic low back pain . LBP interfere biomechanical change , also cause ability work lead reduced productivity , economic burden individual society medical cost Recent study indicate patient chronic low back pain present diminished postural control , manifest problem balance . Postural balance control sensory information , central processing neuromuscular response . Alterations proprioception possible cause alteration postural balance individual low back pain . For clinical study use core stabilization exercise ( CSE ) treatment reveal conflicting finding pain , functional disability muscle response chronic LBP . The study investigate CSE isolate factor . Kumar ( 2011 ) report improvement CSE joint mobility pain pressure threshold patient clinical lumbar instability ; however , immediate effect CSE blinding process perform . However , effectiveness CSE pain intensity , functional disability , trunk muscle activation pattern improve clinical lumbar instability ( CLI ) . In addition , 10-week CSE provide great train retention effect pain-related outcome induced activation deep abdominal muscle CLI compare conventional treatment ( stretch exercise hot pack ) . However , previous study report indirect effect may occur CLI postural balance kind exercise strengthen CLI . The general trunk strengthen exercise common use physical therapy clinic LBP , improve pain , physical disability , trunk muscle activity . To knowledge , usefulness CSE technique abdominal drawing-in maneuver ( ADIM ) yet investigate CLI patient outcome measure balance .</detailed_description>
