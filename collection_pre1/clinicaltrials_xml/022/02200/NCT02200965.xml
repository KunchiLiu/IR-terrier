	<brief_summary>Health professional usually lead management long term condition Diabetes . In conventional professionally drive compliance model care , patient may place secondary role . National audit show component systematic diabetes care consistently fail despite several year heavy expenditure service focus Diabetes Quality Outcome Framework . To extent due nature process may engage patient focus informed patient centre concern ? The aim research determine effectiveness healthcare delivery approach patient , empower structured guidance specific information diabetes , take decision get involve diabetes care determine hard measure engagement outcomes . The methodology whole population cluster randomise control study intervention delivery individualise diabetes specific structured report , look impact measure key diabetes access process outcomes . The contention patient , guide understanding empowerment enablement , equip highly person specific risk stratify outcome base information , inform regard action may accordingly take , enable make significant impactful contribution improvement care . This large scale project deliver research question test , efficient cost effective manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Individualized Structured Information Provision Patients , Diabetes Related Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis &amp; Aim : The central aim determine whether communication data structure key diabetes process outcomes directly people diabetes , emphasis enabling , inform empower engagement service provision drive improvement key parameter structure diabetes care access , process outcome . Thus hypothesise communicate letter , proven readable , informative , valuable desire user acceptance analysis evidence drive engagement user demonstrate measure access process subsequently attainment access process permit achievement diabetes clinical outcome . Project Design The trial design prospective cluster randomise control trial intervention ( structured reporting patient ) key outcome ( define ) . All patient diabetes Wolverhampton randomly allocate receive 3 mailing 0 , 3 6 month ( Active Group ) 1 mail 3 month ( Control Group ) structure diabetes report ( My Diabetes , My Information , My Plan ) . Using pan district integrate diabetes information system , data parameter observe 0 , 3 , 6 12 monthly interval 12 month follow delivery report . The objective determine whether repeat provision structure , specific annotate process outcome information promote patient improve health care whether action /or seek support , advice help measure use Process Score Outcome Score - emplace know surrogate marker clinical outcome diabetes ( eg HbA1c ) improve without service Access completion process . The project run 2 year - 6 month set , 1 year active implementation , 6 month analysis , publication , dissemination closure . Throughout , evidence effective methodology transition standard NHS process . Project Feasibility : The Wolverhampton diabetes service well integrated across primary secondary care . A centralized pan district register establish . Data linkage multiple system place , include direct link local GP data warehouse ( Graphnet ) specialist / secondary care system . Data management governance system place . Data quality subject roll audit consistently &gt; 97 % accuracy . Effective use data demonstrate care pathway - e.g . diabetes retinal screening programme ( national EQA ) innovative foot care pathway Wolverhampton amputation rate amongst low country . The local service good track record clinical research . The project full support key NHS grouping include local Diabetes GP Commissioning Lead ( Dr M Sidhu ) specialist service Clinical Director . All relevant significant others engage local Diabetes Implementation Group - include large local user group ( Wolverhampton Action 4 Diabetes ) regional office Diabetes UK . We run pilot test feasibility effectiveness key intervention ( structure diabetes information report ) . This involved consultation diverse diabetes user group conduct questionnaire survey 50 patient attend hospital diabetes clinic . Following translation learn pilot NHS process , project fully achievable propose . Data Analysis : Data analyse SPSS group ( pair unpaired ) effect individual process outcome parameter summary score . Thus access process outcome score ( define ) calculate baseline 3 monthly interval 1 year analyse determine within group effect 2 way analysis variance ( group-by-time repeat measure ANOVA ) Significance set 5 % level . Professorial level academic statistical advice available within local diabetes research group . A power calculation predict sample size warrant since entire population ( sample ) study .</detailed_description>
