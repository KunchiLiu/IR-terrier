	<brief_summary>Compromised respiratory function result tetraplegia lead many tetraplegics require mechanical ventilation acute phase injury . Mechanical ventilation associate additional cost local health care provider reduce quality life patient . Electrical stimulation abdominal muscle previously use improve respiratory function tetraplegic patient chronic stage injury . In study investigator aim evaluate whether electrical stimulation abdominal muscle assist process wean mechanical ventilation acute ventilator dependent spinal cord injure patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation ( AFES ) Assist Ventilator Weaning Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The principal aim study evaluate feasibility use Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation ( AFES ) assist wean mechanical ventilator acute ventilator dependent tetraplegic subject . Participants : 10 ventilator dependent tetraplegic participant acute stage injury recruit inpatient Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit ( QENSIU ) , Southern General Hospital , Glasgow . The participant match injury level , age ( +/5 year ) sex control obtain historic record previous patient QENSIU . Experimental Procedures : Each participant take part daily AFES-assisted Weaning session ( 5 time per week ) alternative week . Progress monitor weekly Assessment session . The total duration participation 8 week . AFES-assisted Weaning session : The aim wean session strengthen abdominal muscle provide support ventilator free breathing . The participant receive AFES training per day predetermine time ( see ) , 5 day per week . Before study begin end week assessment session conduct . AFES training session continue throughout even patient successfully weaned end 8 week period . All procedure carry participant 's bedside procedures clinician participant 's nurse present . The duration AFES training initially 20 minutes/day . This increase 30 minute week 3 40 minute week 5 7 . While participant still able breathe independently ventilator , AFES apply participant connect ventilator . As weaning progress , Spontaneous Breathing Trials ( SBTs ) begin AFES apply participant disconnected ventilator . While participant ventilator oxygen saturation level ( SaPO2 ) monitor record every minute . Participant immediately reconnected ventilator SaPO2 fall clinically critical value 92 % . Assessment session : An initial assessment session conduct day 1 study provide baseline measure participant 's respiratory function . Assessment session conduct per week ass wean progress . The assessment session augment period AFES training ensure prescribed period AFES achieve ( see ) . During assessment session participant 's respiratory function ( Secondary Outcome Measures ) assess .</detailed_description>
