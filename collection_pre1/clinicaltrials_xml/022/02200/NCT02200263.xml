	<brief_summary>The LUVIA study randomize placebo-controlled trial design investigate effect lutein zeaxanthin supplementation macular pigment visual function ocular oculocutaneous albinism . Lutein zeaxanthin supplementation compare placebo ( treatment ) gel pill period 12 month , study visit approximately every 3 month first year final visit 18 month enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ocular oculocutaneous albinism represent spectrum disorder absent significantly diminish amount melanin either across different body tissue - skin , hair , eye ( Oculocutaneous Albinism 1 2 ) , exclusively eye tissue ( Ocular Albinism 1 ) . The functionality clinical finding diverse ( phenotype ) , direct correlation establish underlying mutation ( genotype ) . The common ocular phenotype include iris transillumination , foveal hypoplasia , nystagmus , reduce visual acuity , refractive error , photosensitivity abnormal development visual pathway characteristic abnormal rout ganglion cell axon chiasma , result abnormal visually evoke potential . Current treatment option limit optical method low vision aid . The mechanism melanin pigment formation RPE cell role visual pathways structure development completely understood , correlation find amount fundus pigmentation visual function albino patient . The absent pigmentation within retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) may thus contribute visual performance deficit . The macular pigment ( MP ) consist two main carotenoid , lutein zeaxanthin , concentrate macular region retina . MP hypothesize function via protective mechanism absorb blue light incident retina thereby reduce oxidative damage underlying photoreceptors . It also think improve visual function via reduction chromatic aberration glare . It currently unclear variability macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) affect congenital retinal condition . The MP would , however , hypothetical good candidate improve visual performance - simply increase pigmentation , reduce light scatter thus glare sensitivity . As pigment produce retina , absorb via diet , manipulate alteration diet supplementation thereby provide potential therapy retinal disease . It however necessary first see MPOD level measurable disorder dietary advice provide completion LUVIA study . Further , evaluation structural functional property retina provide great insight possible function MP retinal disease include whether supplementation would benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 12 year old old Clinical and/or genetic diagnosis ocular oculocutaneous albinism Ocular medium allow acceptable visualization retina . Ocular medium allow acceptable quality ocular coherence tomography ( OCT ) and/or fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) scan . At least one reliable central macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) measurement capture enrollment visit least one eligible eye Best correct visual acuity 20/200 good one eligible eye ( eye confirm eligible MPOD testing ) . Persons take lutein and/or zeaxanthin supplement past 6 month Pregnant plan become pregnant Evidence present past retinal macular condition congenital foveal hypoplasia History gastrointestinal disease would interfere absorption lutein zeaxanthin Participation clinical trial require visual test administration drug ( market investigational ) within 60 day entry study ( day inform consent sign ) Inability communicate cooperate investigator due cognitive impairment poor general health Any condition , opinion investigator , likely interfere successful collection measure require study</criteria>
