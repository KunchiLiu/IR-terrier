	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin without radiation therapy work treat patient localize liver cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin effective without radiation therapy treat patient localize liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Cisplatin With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Localized Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect overall survival ( OS ) patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect local control patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . II . To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect adverse event patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . III . To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect regional control patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . IV . To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect distant metastases patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . V. To evaluate addition liver-directed radiation therapy chemotherapy respect progression-free survival patient unresectable , localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) least 30 minute cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without disease progression randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 8 1 course . Beginning 7-21 day last dose chemotherapy , patient undergo 15 fraction image-guided radiation therapy deliver 19-26 27-34 day . Beginning 7 day completion radiation therapy , patient continue treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV cisplatin IV Arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue gemcitabine hydrochloride discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
