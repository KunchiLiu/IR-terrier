	<brief_title>The Preventative Role Exogenous Melatonin Administration Patients With Advanced Cancer Who Are Risk Delirium : Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium common distress neuropsychiatric syndrome palliative care variety setting . It associate increase morbidity , mortality , health care cost importantly level patient family distress . Inpatient palliative care deliver stand-alone hospice unit increasingly designate unit acute care hospital , delirium occurrence rate 80 % report last hour day death . Most patient unit cancer diagnosis . Given increase elderly proportion population , cancer predominantly disease elderly , pivotal need develop primary , secondary tertiary preventative strategy delirium patient . Although sleep-wake cycle disturbance core diagnostic criterion delirium , study delirium cancer patient report occurrence rate 75-100 % . This likely reflect circadian rhythm disturbance . Recent research suggest give melatonin patient admit hospital may prevent develop delirium . This feasibility study aim inform large randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind , parallel-group , single-centre trial oral , daily administer single dose melatonin prevent delirium patient advance cancer . The study conduct 31-bed Palliative Care Unit ( PCU ) , university teach unit , Bruyère Continuing Care . The intervention consist single daily sublingually administer tablet either 3mg non-animal synthetic source placebo 21.00 hour ( ±1 hour ) , start study day 1 stopping study day 28 admission earlier event death discharge . The study drug discontinue immediately incident delirium occur day 28 . Throughout trial , multiple dimension feasibility evaluate recruitment , retention acceptability study procedure .</detailed_description>
