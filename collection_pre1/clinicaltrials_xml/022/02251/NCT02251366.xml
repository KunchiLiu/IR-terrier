	<brief_summary>Intravitreal delivery anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) drug revolutionize management neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( NVAMD ) . However , requirement near monthly administration therapy couple grow number patient need treatment become universal challenge efficient delivery care retina physician . While many retina practice increase size staff accommodate grow patient population increase efficiency aid digital photography , patient encounter time clinic continue increase , often span 2-4 hour . While maintain high level patient care , streamline alternative evaluation patient NVAMD determine whether intravitreal therapy anti-VEGF agent indicate particular office visit would desirable . This multi-satellite , prospective , randomize pilot study compare standard-of-care , physician- base retinal evaluation , define retinal examination physician standard image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) optional fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , versus physician-guided diagnostic evaluation , define standard image OCT optional FA without retinal examination physician management NVAMD anti-VEGF therapy . Outcomes study aim primarily demonstrate physician-guided diagnostic approach manage patient NVAMD inferior physician-based retinal evaluation base measure change baseline visual acuity central subfield thickness ( CSF ) OCT. Other outcome assess study length visit time , number intravitreal injection anti-VEGF agent administer , number diagnostic test perform determine whether treatment give visit , frequency retinal examination perform participate patient cohort . Perceptions quality vision patient satisfaction capture interview patient follow clinic visit ; clinical impression physician capture brief physician survey . Finally , feasibility recruiting patient , measure many eligible patient see Wilmer satellite , many patient agree randomize , many patient follow-up , attrition rate 4 8-month outcome visit assess .</brief_summary>
