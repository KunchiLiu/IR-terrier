	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen demonstrate reduce long term disease burden cost . Unfortunately , less 65 % age-eligible person US actually screen CRC . The lead method , colonoscopy FIT ( fecal immunochemical test ) testing , patient-associated barrier reduce use . The combination bowel preparation procedure time barrier colonoscopy , stool handle part sample protocol reduces FIT usage . It hypothesize supported variety preference study availability blood-based assay CRC screening would increase patient participation adherence CRC screen reduce barrier prevent participation . This study design investigate relative participation CRC screening average risk , screen eligible patient demonstrate non-adherence guideline-recommended screening modality . Participation fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) blood-based Epi proColonÂ® test examine . Screening eligible average-risk patient identify non-adherent medical record eligible study . Potential subject recruit participate study via mail and/or clinic visit . All study subject enrol clinic visit randomize two study arm . Those assigned Arm 1 offer FIT test kit home use . Those assigned Arm 2 offer blood draw Epi proColon test . Rates adherence compare accept complete blood test accept complete FIT test . A passive control , usual care arm comprise subject meet eligibility criterion , recruit participate study . In conjunction publish data ( Johnson et al , 2014 ) , relative utilization blood test compare screening participation via FIT . Increased participation Epi proColon blood test could increase screen rate non-adherent population . Additionally , test positive trial , rate adherence colonoscopy determine .</brief_summary>
