	<brief_summary>With age general population broadening indication , number pacemaker recipient steadily increase . The incidence infection implant material , dread major complication , also rise . The diagnosis evident presence abscessed pocket , cutaneous breakthrough pulse generator vegetation attach lead . On hand , proportion patient present less specific clinical manifestation pacemaker recipient may recurrently hospitalize infectious disorder unknown origin despite detailed investigation . Without proof lead infection , removal system without confirmation infection usually propose , despite know morbidity mortality associate extraction procedure ( 0.5 2 % ) . Positive culture lead implies lead involve infectious process . In recent year , 18FDG-PET-CT scan make promising contribution different area include image detect infection different organ site . Absence hyperfixation lead , identify 18FDG-PET/CT scan may accurate sign absence pace system infection . The extraction intracardiac implant material , indicate current standard strategy , may result negative bacteriological culture 10 25 % patient , even receive antibiotic extraction . The hypothesis study new strategy add 18FDG-PET-CT current strategy may avoid reduce false-positives . Therefore hypothesized sensitivity 18FDG-PET-CT high enough avoid unnecessary extraction uninfected lead , result high negative predictive value new diagnostic strategy incorporate 18FDG-PET-CT . The present study aim provide valid estimate diagnostic accuracy parameter 18FDG-PET-CT , especially sensitivity . For clinical study , firstly , 18FDG-PET-CT exam perform patient , suspicion pace defibrillation lead infection , hospitalize cardiology unit ; secondarily , intervention extraction intra-cardiac material , general anesthesia , practice bacteriological culture extract material require . The end study visit complete last day material extraction . The follow last 2 7 day .</brief_summary>
