	<detailed_description>[ Introduction ] It estimate 5.5 % Danish population suffers diabetes - correspond 320.000 person . Among Danish diabetic patient yearly incidence foot ulcer higher 3.000 prevalence high 22.000 . Diabetics lifetime risk foot ulcer 15 % . Amputation possible consequence diabetic foot ulcer . A 19-year follow-up study perform newly diagnose diabetic show incidence amputation 400 per 100.000 patient year . Economical cost associate diabetic foot ulcer vary severity treatment ulcer . In Denmark cost include hospitalized treatment , outpatient treatment , homecare social service calculate ( write Danish krone 2009 ) : - Healed foot ulcer without ischemia : 152.800 - Healed foot ulcer ischemia : 252 . 800 - Foot ulcer minor amputation : 407.900 - Foot ulcer major amputation : 597.300 Groups include foot ulcer minor major amputation comprise 5 % total number diabetic foot ulcer ( correspond 150 amputation per year ) . Total cost diabetic foot ulcer 793 million Danish krone . Foot ulcer reduce patient ' mobility quality life . Amputation among feared complication diabetes affect patient ' quality life much heart failure cerebral stroke . The treatment diabetic foot ulcer several place Denmark take care multidisciplinary team . Thus metabolic control , wound debridement , vascular surgery , treatment infection , pain relief , occupational therapy etc . take care one specialize hospital unit . Parallel reorganization Danish health system 2000 - 2011 significant decline diabetic major amputation . However , decline see group minor amputation may patient identify early amputation thereby avoid major amputation . Conclusively , number diabetic ulcer patient still offer treatment amputation . It important develop supplement treatment option worst case diabetic foot ulcer . The goal ulcer heal optimize few patient amputate . In field diabetic foot ulcer substantial amount research go try develop exist method treatment find new therapeutic technique . Extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( ESWT ) promise new option ulcer treatment . ESWT long known kidney stone treatment , recently ESWT establish treatment regional pain disorder ( plantar fasciitis heel lateral epicondylitis elbow ) non-union long bone fracture . Furthermore , ischemic heart disease Peyronies disease treat ESWT . Some study show positive result treat foot ulcer ESWT . In physic , shockwaves high fluctuation acoustical energy . When applied tissue shockwaves may stimulate anabolic cellular response , increase blood perfusion neo-angiogenesis . Shockwaves may furthermore promote anti-inflammatory effect pain regulation . On molecular scale upregulation TGF-beta1 , VEGF , FGF-2 signal together increase level NO substance P tissue see follow ESWT . During wound heal NO show induce IGF release NF-kappaB pathway . Regarding anti-inflammatory effect , ESWT reduce cellular expression metalloproteases interleukin . Clinical study test foot ulcer ESWT show significant side effect shockwave treatment . These study conclude ESWT safe use . [ Purpose ] The investigator want test low-energy ESWT help heal complex diabetic foot ulcer . The effect ESWT evaluate measure wound size number total healing , perception pain use visual analog scale . Measures cutaneous oxygen tension foot sense feeling include well . [ Hypothesis ] ESWT improve diabetic patient ' heal chronic foot ulcer . In study investigator expect see fast wound area reduction among patient treat ESWT compare control group receive treatment accord current clinical guideline . Primary outcome measure ESWT - Shorter time wound heal Secondary outcome measure ESWT - Pain reduction - Increased perfusion - No side effect [ Method ] Recruitment patient : 6 month consecutive identification inclusion patient Wound Clinic , Department Plastic Surgery OUH . Every year approximately 400 patient new ulcer refer clinic . Patients either newly refer advance relate clinic offer participation . Randomization : Participants randomize either intervention group control group use computer-generated table indicate allocation . Intervention group : ESWT supplement treatment follow current clinical guideline . Control group : Ulcer treatment follow clinical guideline . ESWT : A total 6 time treatment 3 week period . Intervals ESWT 3 - 4 day . ESWT carry use DUOLITH SD1 T-Top shockwave device , STORZ MEDICAL AG . The device CE mark register ESWT use . Description intervention course : Participants group 8 consultation 7 week period . 6 time ESWT follow 2 time follow-up respectively 2 4 week last ESWT . Description control course : Participants group 4 consultation 7 week period . First consultation enrollment . Second , third , fourth consultation respectively 3 , 5 , 7 week enrollment . These four consultation correspond intervention group consultation number 1 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Baseline data : By first consultation participant characterize regard follow variable : - Sex - Age - Comorbidity ( quantified use Charlson Index ) - Medical treatment : antidiabetic , analgesic ( relevant drug NSAIDs , neuroleptic opioids ) , antihypertensives , statins / cholesterol lower drug - Smoking habit alcohol consumption - Body Mass Index - Marital status , educational level type profession - Classification foot ulcer use University Texas Wound Score - Biochemistry : HbA1c , CRP , leukocytes , s-Na , s-K , s-creatinine , s-alkaline phosphatase , s-lactate dehydrogenase , s-cholesterol level - Bacterial colonization ulcer Biochemical parameter medical treatment data obtain patient record . New blood sample take patient record include relevant test result - furthermore result must 2 month old . Patients enrol study access usually offer ulcer treatment . Information treatment modality frequency obtain participant patient record patient interview . [ Data handle ] Data note REDCap online system . Data store study end . Analysis carry use Stata software . The study use one data collector also enter data REDCap . However , data available missing , specific measurement exclude analysis . Missing data report publish study result . [ Statistics ] Average percentage reduction ulcer area study 's primary end-point . If data normally distribute ( determined probit logit plot ) statistical analysis perform use Student 's t-test . Non-normally distributed data analyze use transformation data non-parametric statistic ( Wilcoxon rank sum test Mann-Whitney U-test ) . Other numerical data ( cutaneous oxygen tension , pain scoring , use analgesic ) statistically evaluated manner ulcer area reduction . Complete ulcer healing regard binary end-point data . Healing proportion calculate compare intervention group control group - risk ratio confidence interval determine . Significance data test use Pearson 's chi-squared test ( alternatively Fisher 's exact test data material small / fit chi-test ) . Sense touch data evaluate way . Comparison patient 's quality life intervention group control group base average questionnaire score . [ Study power ] This study consider pilot study . Earlier study investigate ESWT ulcer treatment focus study population different . The investigator consider design unique since investigator able identify earlier study use standard care control group compare intervention 6 time ESWT 3 week . [ Project feasibility ] The project carry undergraduate research year period 1/9-2014 - 1/9-2015 . Medical student Sune Møller Jeppesen accept undergraduate student Faculty Health Science , University Southern Denmark . The undergraduate student work guidance main supervisor Lars Lund , professor , MD , DMSci . Knud Bonnet Yderstræde , MD , PhD , Benjamin Schnack Rasmussen , MD , PhD-student , co-supervisors project . Primarily , undergraduate student 's work involve ESWT consultation data collection . The student train relevant technique need measure ESWT effect . Office facility available undergraduate student Department Urology . Consultation room device clinical measurement available Wound Clinic , Department Plastic Surgery OUH . Shockwave device purchase ( see budget information ) . The project register relevant authority include Danish Data Protection Agency Committee Health Research Ethics , Denmark . [ Publication ] Trial result apply publish international scientific journal . Furthermore result present science conference within field interest . [ Economy ] The investigator seek research funding private public organization . The investigator apply 120.000 Danish krone ( DKK ) cover 12 month undergraduate student salary 371.125 DKK shockwave device purchase . Costs related office facility 14.500 DKK . Project overhead 3 % total cost . Total project cost 520.794 DKK . [ Significance project ] The project aim evaluate healing effect ESWT . If ESWT effectively improve heal complicate diabetic foot ulcer , ESWT consider implementation ulcer treatment clinical guideline . Better ulcer heal potentially improve patient 's quality life decrease number diabetic patient amputate ( least postpone amputation ) . Later , research may carry refine ulcer ESWT . Proven ulcer heal effect ESWT may also inspire future study test ESWT effect context clinical condition . Possibly ESWT use several setting regenerative anti-inflammatory effect want .</detailed_description>
