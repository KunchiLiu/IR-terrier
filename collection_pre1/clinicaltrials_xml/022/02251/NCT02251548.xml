	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate new drug call ibrutinib combination standard drug fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) possible treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Ibrutinib Plus FCR Previously Untreated , Younger Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ibrutinib type drug call kinase inhibitor . It believe block protein call Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) help CLL cell live grow . By block , possible study drug kill cancer cell stop grow . Ibrutinib FDA approve treatment CLL patient receive least one prior treatment ; however , FDA yet approve ibrutinib first treatment previously untreated CLL . Therefore , ibrutinib still consider study drug , mean still study . Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) intravenous chemotherapy antibody drug together standard chemotherapy regimen use young patient CLL . Although FCR highly effective , typically lead cure . In research study , investigator combine new treatment CLL , ibrutinib , standard chemotherapy regimen CLL , FCR , determine whether combination ( iFCR ) safe effective patient previously untreated CLL .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must confirm diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . per IWCLL 2008 criterion . Patients must also require therapy diagnosis , base meeting least one follow criterion : evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development , worsen , anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/L ) and/or thrombocytopenia ( platelet &lt; 100 x 10^9/L ) massive ( ≥ 6 cm leave costal margin ) , progressive , symptomatic splenomegaly massive node ( least 10 cm long diameter ) , progressive , symptomatic lymphadenopathy progressive lymphocytosis increase 50 % 2month period LDT &lt; 6 month . Lymphocyte double time may obtain linear regression extrapolation absolute lymphocyte count obtain interval 2 week observation period 2 3 month . In subject initial blood lymphocyte count &lt; 30 x 10^9/L , LDT use single parameter define indication treatment . In addition , factor contribute lymphocytosis lymphadenopathy CLL ( eg , infection ) exclude autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive corticosteroid standard therapy document constitutional symptom , define 1 follow diseaserelated symptom sign : unintentional weight loss &gt; 10 % within 6 month prior screen significant fatigue ( inability work perform usual activity ) fever &gt; 100.5° F 38.0° C 2 week prior screen without evidence infection night sweat 1 month prior screen without evidence infection No prior CLLdirected therapy institute due patient previously meet IWCLL 2008 criterion treatment Age great equal 18 year less equal 65 . Because CLL extremely rare person &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Because iFCR aggressive therapy likely less welltolerated even fit elderly subject , person &gt; 65 year age exclude ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Adequate hematologic function independent growth factor support least 7 day prior screen randomization , exception pegylated GCSF ( pegfilgrastim ) darbepoetin administer within 14 day screen . Patients must meet follow hematologic criterion screen : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750 cells/mm3 ( 0.75 x 109/L ) . Platelet count ≥ 50,000 cells/mm3 ( 50 x 109/L ) . Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/L Adequate hepatic renal function define : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( unless bilirubin rise due Gilbert 's syndrome nonhepatic origin ) Adequate renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN PT/INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN PTT ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN . The effect ibrutinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason similar agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Concurrent Conditions : History malignancy , except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥ 3 year first dose study drug felt low risk recurrence treat physician . Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease . Adequately treated carcinoma situ without evidence disease . Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy ( eg , cyclosporine A , tacrolimus , etc. , chronic administration &gt; 20 mg/day prednisone ) within 28 day first dose study drug . Vaccinated live , attenuated vaccine within 4 week first dose study drug . Recent infection require systemic treatment complete ≤ 14 day first dose study drug . Known bleed disorder ( eg , von Willebrand 's disease ) hemophilia . History stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 6 month prior enrollment . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Patients positive hepatitis B core antibody hepatitis B surface antigen must negative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) result enrollment . Those PCR positive exclude . Any uncontrolled active systemic infection . Major surgery within 4 week first dose study drug . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition , organ system dysfunction , investigator 's opinion , could compromise subject 's safety put study outcome undue risk . Currently active , clinically significant cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled arrhythmia Class 3 4 congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association Functional Classification ; history myocardial infarction , unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior randomization . Unable swallow capsule malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis , partial complete bowel obstruction . Lactating pregnant . Patients receive study agent Patients know CNS involvement Baseline QTcF &gt; 480 m . NOTE : This criterion apply patient leave bundle branch block . Patients require warfarin vitamin K antagonists anticoagulation ( anticoagulant allow consultation Principal Investigator ) . Concurrent administration medication food strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A Patients ongoing use prophylactic antibiotic eligible long evidence active infection antibiotic include list prohibit medication Significant comorbid condition disease judgment Principal Investigator would place patient undue risk interfere study Unable receive prophylactic treatment pneumocystis</criteria>
