	<brief_summary>A recent province-wide survey ( Alberta , Canada ) suggest clinician ' belief soft lumbar brace low back pain ( LBP ) vary substantially . Approximately 50 % clinician ( MDs , DCs , PTs ) find back brace `` useful '' acute back pain remain half report brace cause muscle atrophy . While previous study suggest brace acute low back condition reduce pain cause atrophy , prior study assess back function brace use self-reported objective measure within cohort . PURPOSE : To assess self-reported objective measure spine function , , use inelastic lumbar brace two week period . STUDY DESIGN : Before-After Design OUTCOME MEASURES : Self-reported spine function , spinal stiffness muscle endurance . METHODS : Three group study : asymptomatics wear brace ( -LBP/-Brace ) , asymptomatics brace ( -LBP/+Brace ) acute LBP subject brace ( +LBP/+Brace ) . Both group brace subject ( -LBP/+Brace ; +LBP/+Brace ) instruct wear brace continually 2 week exception bedroom &amp; bathroom activity . Before 2 week period , 3 measure spine function perform : spinal stiffness via motorize indentation L3 spinous process , modify Sorensen test ( time lumbar extension gravity ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) . Unbraced ( -LBP/-Brace ) subject studied time measure . Repeated measure analyse variance conduct three outcome significance level 0.05 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Lumbar Bracing Spinal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : While various treatment low back pain ( LBP ) prescribe , one particular appear frequently self-prescribed : external lumbar bracing ( i.e . elastic corset similar device ) . Given mechanical function back bear static dynamic load LBP think mechanical nature , biological plausibility underlies brace treatment LBP Indeed , several report suggest lumbar bracing may effective LBP patient . The high frequency self-prescribed bracing may result clinical community 's reluctance prescribe device . Approximately half Alberta spine clinician believe spine bracing result muscle atrophy and/or future dependency brace . Conversely , recent work laboratory show two week brace wear , volume spinal muscle remain unchanged asymptomatic subject ( i.e . brace-induced atrophy cause ) Objective hypothesis : While brace 14 day result decreased muscle volume asymptomatic subject , need understand brace preserve muscle volume muscle function decline . This information would allow u understand effect brace spinal function independent change muscle volume . Therefore , hypothesize brace-wearing result insignificant alteration spinal function . Future Relevance : Results pilot study allow u construct future investigation reveal underlying mechanism brace respect alleviation LBP . Subjects : Subjects gender age 18 65 recruited University Alberta surround area . The target recruitment population 1 ) asymptomatic subject 2 ) low back pain . Subjects exclude study history back pain red flag , pregnant ( believe may pregnant ) contraindication describe full protocol . Methods : Potential subject complete survey obtain demographic data well focus medical history physical examination perform one research team . If subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion provide write , informed consent , enrol study . Those able enrolled thank dismiss . Asymptomatic subject assign randomly brace non-brace cohort . From recruited subject , three cohort create : 1 ) Asymptomatic subject wear brace ( -LBP/Brace+ ) , 2 ) asymptomatic subject wear brace ( -LBP/-Brace ) 3 ) low back pain subject wear brace ( +LBP/+Brace ) . Because experiment design assess brace efficacy , need include cohort symptomatic subject wear brace . Each subject wear brace fit sized elastic brace supply charge subject . Subjects instruct remove brace well circumstance permit remove brace ( washroom , shower , sleep ) . The subject also inform brace monitoring feature determine brace compliance well activity level . As soon possible brace fitting , battery test conduct determine subject 's spinal function . These test follow : 1 . The Oswestry Disability Index ( OWDI ) . The OWDI self-reported measure function . The OWDI establish reliability validity use extensively low back pain research . 2 . Spinal Stiffness testing . This test use blunt probe push back rest subject measure stiffness spine . It develop lab use many prior study Universities Alberta , Hong Kong Utah . 3 . Rehabilitation Ultrasound Imaging ( RUSI ) . This test use ultrasound image spine muscle simple task ( e.g . arm raising ) quantify ability back muscle contract desire magnitude timing . This test well-described literature approve use previously laboratory . 4 . Modified Sorensen test . This timed test spine function subject ask straighten back semi-inclined position pain onset and/or failure maintain target position . The test , variant , well-studied since first described 1984 . The modified version test use show safe perform acute back pain subject . The subject release usual activity daily live period 14 day . To determine problem subject wear brace , subject contact PI research team within first 24 hour follow brace fit approximately every three day time . If correction brace make satisfactory research team subject , subject thank dismiss . Following two week experiment period , subject attend laboratory . Usage data extract data logger wear brace . If subject worn brace le 75 % requested time , subject dismiss thanked participation . If subject wear brace 75 % requested time , spinal function test perform second time . Change score 5 spine function test calculate compare three cohort use analysis variance ( alpha = 0.05 ) . Expected result : Given prior data muscle volume change 14 day bed rest , expect brace-wearing reduce spinal function symptomatic asymptomatic population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects enrol study age 18 65 include gender . Asymptomatic subject asymptomatic low back pain period 3 month . Symptomatic subject nonspecific low back pain acute chronic nature . Recruiting nonspecific low back pain ensures enrol subject specific cause back pain ( eg , spinal fracture ) spinal function test contraindicate . Specific spinal function test use , excluded subject include suspect confirmed malignancy cause back pain , spinal fracture ( current within last 5 year ) , previous nonday surgery abdomen , spine pelvis hip , presence nerve root involvement ( presence least 2 3 : myotomal weakness , alter sensation dermatomal pattern , and/or alter knee/ankle reflex ) , ankylose spondylitis current skin condition may aggravate bracing , These exclusion criterion relate back condition spinal function test contraindicate ( eg , malignancy ) great chance cause discomfort ( eg , nerve root involvement ) . General exclusion criterion include : osteoporosis , rheumatoid arthritis ( take disease modify antirheumatic drug ) , pregnancy suspect pregnancy , know severe spondylolisthesis , severe scoliosis , Type I diabetes mellitus , hyperparathyroidism , hyperthyroidism , inability lie prone least 40 minute , inability tolerate back extension spinal indentation ( eg , indentation cause discomfort ) , inability speak read English ( ensure participant understand happen reliably relay discomfort ) . People currently take muscle relaxant also exclude . In addition , subject hypertensive , prone hypertension ( smoker ) , exclude study subject history aortic aneurysm . Although hypertension aortic aneurysm contraindication lumbar bracing , exclude trial . Finally , person low high body mass index may eligible participate unable fit properly brace . Subjects also exclude feel would unable lie prone ( i.e . facedown ) 1 hour spinal stiffness RUSI testing .</criteria>
