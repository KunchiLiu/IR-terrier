Patients must sign consent form take part study . Patients participation study last 25-26 week . If Patients recruit inpatient Freedom House UNC Hospitals , duration participation extend remain day inpatient , initial clinic visit shortly discharge start take intranasal test treatment , 12-week period take intranasal study medication day home attend 8 clinic visit final 12-week period stop medication attend clinic visit 4 12-week time point . If patient inpatient recruit initial outpatient clinic visit , attend another clinic visit start intranasal study medication take intranasal test treatment day home attend 8 additional clinic visit 12 week period attend 2 additional clinic visit 4 12 week stop intranasal medication . Each clinic visit last 1-2 hour . If patient inpatient Freedom House UNC Hospitals , undergo evaluation toward end admission determine eligible participate study .

If patient test positive , investigator keep data confidential unless investigator require law disclose data . - Patients blood ( 15 ml 1 tablespoon ) urine sample take laboratory test , patient woman , determine pregnant . - Patients physical examination study doctor . If result evaluation show patient eligible participate , patient randomly assign ( like flip coin ) receive either oxytocin placebo intranasal spray . Members researcher staff instruct patient self-administer intranasal spray dose spray bottle . If patient inpatient Freedom House UNC Hospitals , take first intranasal test dose clinic visit schedule day discharge . If patient inpatient , patient take first intranasal test dose clinic visit schedule shortly screen visit . Patients take intranasal spray bottle home continue self-administer intranasal test dos three time day ( approximately breakfast , lunch dinner time ) two day thereafter take intranasal test dos twice day ( approximately breakfast dinner time ) . Each dose 6 spray nose ( 3 per nostril ) . Neither patient research staff nurse know whether patient take oxytocin placebo nasal spray .
