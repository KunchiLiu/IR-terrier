	<brief_summary>The goal clinical study find certain instruments/devices , wide field fluorescence image point spectroscopy and/or brush cytology , help health care provider find mouth cancer quickly standard oral clinical exam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Aids Detection Diagnosis Oral Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : Certain type light may cause cell give tiny amount light ( call fluorescence ) . Researchers learn cancer cell normal cell reflect light give fluorescence differently . Researchers want find different kind light use discover area mouth may abnormal cancerous cell . If agree take part study , researcher may use 3 type image instrument take picture reading several area mouth . - VELScope FDA approve handheld camera device take image mouth different color light . The VELScope shin blue light mouth , picture take use camera attach device . - Widefield Fluorescence Imaging use non-contact image device similar VELScope . It shin different color light take picture inside mouth use digital camera . - Point Spectroscopy System use probe ( size tip pen ) gently place several area mouth . Different color light direct optic fiber line mouth , probe collect light return tissue sends information computer . Researchers record whether doctor find area within mouth may appear completely normal . They collect tissue sample abnormal area use brush biopsy . To perform oral brush biopsy , research press small brush area inside mouth , turn 5-10 time . The area could biopsied include gum , tongue , roof mouth , bottom mouth , inside cheek . Any cell collect inside mouth place slide study study team . The sample collect used testing , leftover sample keep research staff . These procedure take 20 minute total . This investigational study . The VELScope FDA approve device commercially available . Wide-field point spectroscopy system FDA approve authorize research . Up 500 participant take part multicenter study . Up 250 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects 18 year old willing participate . 2 . Persons present : Physical dental exam outside health care center OR Research meetings/gatherings OR Subjects identify MDACC already diagnose oral cancer pre oral cancer : include patient malignancy oral cancer , visitor family member , attendee HNS Oral Cancer Screening event willing participate . 1 . Subjects current diagnosis oral cancer . 2 . Subjects age 18 . It extremely unusual child develop oral cancer , therefore data person young 18 may add unexpected variable could affect data analysis . 3 . Subjects unable unwilling give inform consent .</criteria>
