By virtue freeze-drying technique , Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® live bacterium administered culture medium . It note Lcr Regenerans® already market medical device ( EC marking : 0499 ) . It help regenerate vaginal flora thanks physical chemical effect ( lower vaginal pH ) . A number vitro vivo study demonstrate ability Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® : - establish vaginal epithelium , along durability establishment . - inhibit growth pathogenic organism responsible cause bacterial vaginosis ( Gardnerella vaginalis Prevotella bivia ) also mycoses ( Candida albicans ) , synthesise various microbicidal substance . This research follow Candiflore observational study 514 patient monitor demonstrate clearly positive result favour use vaginal Lcr Regenerans® prevent recurrence VVC . The purpose new research thus demonstrate efficacy Lcr Regenerans® , prevention vulvovaginal candidiasis recurrence patient history VVC recurrent episode , view obtain marketing authorisation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Tolerance Intra-vaginal Treatment With Total Freeze-dried Culture Lcr Regenerans® Prevention Relapses Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment RVVC difficult due multi-factor nature recurrence poorly understood local immune dysfunction may arise . The oral topical antifungal maintenance treatment usually recommend period 6 month , though VVC relapse rate high , 60 70 % woman present recurrence within 2 month follow termination treatment . Moreover , antifungal agent-related adverse event frequent long-term use conducive onset bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) . The vaginal administration probiotic strain ( Lactobacillus ) capable regenerate vaginal flora inhibit development Candida albicans and/or adhesion vaginal epithelium , would appear interesting therapeutic alternative prevent VVC recurrence . The trial medicinal product ( Lcr Regenerans® ) obtain culture strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® . By virtue freeze-drying technique , Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® live bacterium administered culture medium . It note Lcr Regenerans® already market medical device ( EC marking : 0499 ) . It help regenerate vaginal flora thanks physical chemical effect ( lower vaginal pH ) .
