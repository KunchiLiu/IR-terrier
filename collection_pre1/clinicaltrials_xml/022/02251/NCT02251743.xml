	<brief_summary>Additional treatment long-term benefit attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) need ; one promising neurofeedback ( EEG biofeedback ) , several randomize control trial show significant benefit , inconclusive double-blinded ; benefit could nonspecific ( placebo response ) . Because neurofeedback 's labor-intensive cost ( 1 treatment cost much month 's medication ) , It important know much specific benefit yield . This 2- site placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial first test specific benefit neurofeedback adequate power , first design implement collaboratively expert neurofeedback , ADHD , clinical trial , first rigorously monitor quality treatment , also placebo blinding , first follow 2 year examine endure effect ; result , whether positive negative , provide evidence clinical practice public policy regard ADHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current establish , evidence-based treatment attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) incompletely effective universally acceptable , appear wane effect time despite significant immediate benefit . E.g. , FDA-approved medication , show large acute benefit , leave third child partially treat even combined behavioral treatment , demonstrate effective beyond 2 year . Additional treatment need effective persisting benefit , preferably related biomarker predict treatment response . A good candidate electroencephalographic ( EEG ) biofeedback , call neurofeedback ( NF ) . It base 1 ) observation patient ADHD often excessive theta band ( 4-8 Hz ) quantitative EEG power , low beta band ( 13-21 Hz ) power , excessive theta beta ratio ( TBR ) , 2 ) theoretical application operant conditioning correct EEG imbalance . Metaanalysis 6 randomize clinical trial find large benefit inattentive symptom medium benefit hyperactive-impulsive symptom . Unfortunately , none blind . Three 4 small blind study find advantage NF sham , use suboptimal NF , leave situation inconclusive . Because expense time require NF , public health need determine whether specific effect beyond obvious nonspecific benefit focus activity several time week friendly , encourage adult reinforces attend task . Experts NF , ADHD , clinical trial , statistic , data management join design double-blind sham-controlled randomized clinical trial answer several press scientific clinical question way credible . At 2 site ( 1 university &amp; 1 NF clinic ) 70 child ( total N=140 ) age 7 10 rigorously diagnose moderate severe ADHD TBR &gt; 5 randomized 3:2 ratio active TBR downtraining NF vs. sham train equal duration , intensity , appearance . To keep participant study staff blind , sham utilize pre-recorded EEGs participant 's artifact superimpose . The sham program equipment via internet off-site statistician-guided person contact participant . Treatment fidelity train monitor 2 acknowledge NF leader manner protect blind . Multi-domain assessment baseline , mid-treatment , treatment end , follow-ups 6 month , 1 year , 2 year include parent teacher rating symptoms &amp; impairment , neuropsychological test , clinician rating , quantitative EEG well test blind sham inertness . Hypotheses include NF improve parent- teacher-rated inattentive symptom ( primary outcome ) outcomes sham , benefit persist 2 year training , initial TBR moderate treatment response , change TBR mediate response . Research Domain Criteria EEG brain change explore , include relationship TBR clinical symptom , executive-function impairment , sleep .</detailed_description>
