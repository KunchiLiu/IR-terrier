	<detailed_description>Stroke fourth lead cause death , main cause adult disability US . As population age , next 3 decade number stroke expect double . At time , Hispanic population , currently large minority group US expect double . The rapid growth age Hispanics lead dramatic future increase public health impact stroke . This group investigators others extensively described disproportionate burden stroke stroke risk factor ( SRFs ) ( e.g . blood pressure , diabetes , lipid ) among Hispanics . Over last two decade , community health worker ( CHWs ) emerge one promising strategy address Latino health disparity . However , evidence randomize control trial ( RCTs ) support approach remain limited . Recent technology base intervention , particularly use mobile-based platform ( e.g . phone text message ) , show tremendous potential improving outcome among minority population . This team 's ongoing line investigation test Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) intervention rigorous randomize control trial ( RCTs ) aim improve clinical outcome variety health condition include diabetes , cancer Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) disease . The investigator also lead several study address ProMobile technology among minority elder . To date , preliminary data suggest two approach independently may lead considerable improvement stroke risk factor ( SRFs ) . However , evidence use combine approach study use rigorous experimental design health condition limit . Further , data promising intervention among Hispanic stroke patient remain major gap field stroke disparity . In Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Intervention ( HISSPI ) , investigator propose translational research study address minority health form pragmatic clinical trial aim improve health outcome among Latinos . The project extend ongoing work Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) mobile phone technology examine effectiveness combine multilevel intervention adjunct routine health care target stroke risk factor ( SRFs ) among Hispanic patient recent stroke . The investigator focus group patient 25 % risk recurrent stroke next five year , second stroke often much debilitate first stroke . The study conduct two hospital Miami-Dade county ( one public , one private ) . With highly diverse Latino population , Caribbean Central/South Americans , Miami ideal laboratory test approach immigrant community face numerous distinct barrier quality stroke care . Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative ( HISPPI ) also leverage exist resource , include recently fund Florida Puerto Rico Collaboration Reduce Stroke Disparities Clinical Translational Science Award ( CTSA ) . The investigator expect translational research provide new insight approach transform medical practice improve health outcome Latino population ; particularly , context ongoing reform health care delivery . The study design randomize control trial ( RCT ) 300 Latino stroke patient admitted ischemic hemorrhagic stroke , minimal moderate disability result stroke ambulatory modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) &lt; =3 . Primary Objectives : Based evidence base guideline prevent recurrent stroke , investigator determine propose intervention result improve systolic blood pressure among intervention versus usual care group . Blood pressure management single important risk factor prevent recurrent stroke . Secondary Objectives : The investigator also examine propose intervention result improvement secondary stroke risk factor include low density lipoprotein , adherence statin therapy , adherence antiplatelet/anti-thrombotic therapy , among patient diabetes , good glycemic control . Additional outcome : As hypothesis generating analysis , investigator examine , follow outcome : 1 . Quality Life 2 . Health Care utilization ( visit primary care provider stroke specialist ) 3 . Proportion patient re-hospitalized recurrent stroke Hypotheses : Consistent guideline systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) reduction would lead clinically meaningful reduction recurrent stroke risk , investigator hypothesize 12 month , compare usual care , patient randomize Community Health Worker ( CHW ) ProMobile intervention systolic blood pressure 8mmHg low . Least detectable difference secondary outcome : With 300 patient , investigator 80 % power detect difference intervention versus control group 1 ) Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) 13ml/dl low 2 ) 15 % great adherence statin antiplatelet/thrombotic therapy 3 ) among subset diabetes , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 0.9 % low .</detailed_description>
