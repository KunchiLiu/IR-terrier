	<detailed_description>Participants mTBI , well healthy control participant , invite participate two study visit . Both visit occur University Minnesota 's Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) . The first study visit entail ( 1 ) interview determine presence ( , present , severity ) oculomotor difficulty convergence insufficiency , ( 2 ) behavioral measure ( e.g. , visually track move dot ) ass skill allocate spatial attention . For participant participate MRI study CMRR , 15-minute scan acquire research-quality anatomical image brain acquire end first visit . A subset approximately 88 participant participate Visit 1 invited participate Visit 2 . Visit 2 dominated 90-minute scan session 7 Tesla scanner , participant perform 10-minute spatial attention task 10-minute eye movement task , high-resolution diffusion tensor image data acquire participant enjoy movie choice scanner .</detailed_description>
