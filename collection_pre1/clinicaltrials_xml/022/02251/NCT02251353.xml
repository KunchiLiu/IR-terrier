	<detailed_description>Purpose Despite breast cancer common cancer woman develop world , minority patient ( &lt; 10 % ) stage IV disease diagnosis ( 1 ) . In addition , 20-30 % patient early breast cancer experience distant metastatic relapse ( 2 ) . Due advance available multimodality therapy well understanding tumor biology , survival stage IV patient constantly improve ( 3-5 ) . Clinically , oligometastatic breast cancer characterize solitary/few detectable lesion , usually limited single organ , local therapy curative intent could impact survival . This population 'potentially curable ' stage IV disease estimate 1-10 % newly diagnose patient metastatic breast cancer ( 5 ) . A multimodal approach endorse select patient ( 5,6 ) . The identification patient truly oligometastatic disease challenge . Most published series refer era modern imaging ( i.e . positron emission tomography-computed tomography ) , thus many patient probably understaged , potentially leading underestimation global effect aggressive local management . Patients oligometastatic disease divide 3 cohort ( 7,8 ) : 1 ) patient present oligometastases ; 2 ) patient residual oligometastases systemic therapy ; 3 ) relapse oligometastases curative locoregional therapy . These different group possibly distinct prognosis , may need differential approach . Several series report lung liver metastasis resection oligometastatic breast cancer data small series patient collect many year . The large dataset come International Registry Lung Metastases present result lung metastasectomy 467 breast cancer patient ( 9 ) . Complete resection possible 84 % patient lead median survival 37 month ( 5-year OS = 38 % , 10-year OS = 22 % ) . Identified prognostic factor lung resection include disease-free interval number metastasis ( disease-free interval &gt; 36 month solitary metastasis favorable ) , ER status , size metastasis , completeness resection , use anatomical resection ( opposite wedge resection ) ( 9-19 ) . Obviously , report data refer subset patient select favorable prognostic factor , comparison surgically untreated patient threaten serious bias . Pulmonary resection metastatic breast cancer patient , apart potential therapeutic value , also important diagnostic tool , especially patient suspect first recurrence , allow differential diagnosis second primary lung cancer benign lesion ( 19,20 ) . The proportion lesion prove breast cancer metastases various series range 7 % 66 % ( 9,14,18,21 ) . As morbidity mortality pulmonary resection decrease substantially last decade , potentially beneficial procedure discuss select group patient ( 9,19,21 ) . Surgery remove liver metastasis accept treatment modality patient colorectal cancer ( 22 ) . Its role breast cancer , however , much less recognize . Liver common metastatic breast cancer site , 5 % patient isolate liver involvement . In various series hepatic resection breast cancer metastasis , report median survival range 14.5 63 month 5-year survival 14 % 61 % , general , compare well nonsurgically treat patient . Most reported series , however , describe extremely select patient , constitute 1 % le metastatic breast cancer patient treat respective period time ( 22-26 ) . As example , one important series , patient asymptomatic identify intensive surveillance program ( 27 ) . Patients isolate liver metastasis potentially manage local treatment ( surgery , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , cyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery ) . In contrast liver colorectal metastasis , local treatment breast cancer liver metastasis consider therapeutic option due common involvement additional organ ; nevertheless , select patient , local approach associate long-term survival ( 10,29,30 ) . Because patient potentially eligible therapeutic strategy represent 1 % -3 % total metastatic breast cancer population , large global collaboration need confirm impact long-term survival cure ensure adequate statistical power strength result . Enrolled patient must comparable clinical biological characteristic , extent staging , frequency monitoring avoid selection bias stage migration , substantially affect outcome . The number intervention perform metastatic breast cancer dramatically increase past 2 decade . Hepatectomy pulmonary resection stage IV colorectal cancer consider standard care resectable patient isolate hepatic and/or pulmonary disease acceptable performance status . However , indication resection / intervention breast cancer origin metastases clearly define . The aim study focus emerge data intervention ( resection and/or radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , cyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery ) breast cancer metastatic disease lung liver , focus indication resection / intervention . Patient acquisition data collection All patient female . All following demographic , clinical tumour specific data collect : patient age , performance status accord WHO classification time first presentation hospital , stage , type receptor status ( ER , PR , HER-2 ) primary tumour , tumor load lung and/or liver ( uni-or bilateral affection , number metastasis , diameter large tumour size ) , chronology metastasis ( metachronous synchronous ) , presence metastatic ( synchronous metastasis ) recurrent ( metachronous ) extrahepatic tumour growth lymph node involvement mediastinal region hepatoduodenal ligament . In addition , treatment-related follow-up data document : Intervention method ( surgical resection , cryosurgery , laser-induced thermotherapy , radio-frequency ablation , ethanol injection , cyber-knife ) , median follow-up , incidence tumour recurrence , time recurrence , overall survival , administration chemotherapy . Survival calculate date diagnosis lung and/or liver metastasis . Definitions Lung and/or liver metastasis define metachronous interval resection primary tumour first diagnosis metastasis longer 3 month . General physical condition study patient measure performance status accord WHO classification . Prior treatment , patient undergone evaluation complete medical history , physical examination , baseline blood test , image evaluation ( positron emission tomography ( PET-CT ) and/or radiography , bone scintigraphy , compute tomography scan , magnetic resonance imaging , ultrasonography ) . Effects treatment monitor image analysis every 3 month lesion detect diagnosis lung and/or hepatic metastasis every 6 month without detectable lesion treatment . R0 resection complete resection microscopic residual tumor , R1 resection mean complete resection grossly visual tumor define surgeon , microscopic cancer may leave behind . R2 resection indicate partial resection grossly visible tumor leave behind . Effects treatment assessed analysis maximum response , accord either criteria World Health Organization ( WHO ) ( 30 ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.0 ( 31 ) since announcement 2004 . Responses bone metastasis evaluate use method report MD Anderson Cancer Center ( 32,33 ) , CR clear evidence complete bone recalcification attainment near-normal bone architecture normalization scan , partial response radio- logical evidence sclerosis lytic lesion mark improvement bone scan . In recent year , MRI perform available , image information take account evaluation bone metastasis . Responses pleural fluid determine : CR radiological demonstration complete disappearance pleural fluid , PR 50 % decrease . For study inclusion , pathological diagnosis primary lesion obtain , whereas tissue cellular pathology metastatic lesion prefer mandatory . In patient performed surgical resection , complete histopathological response define absence vital tumour cell . Detection tumour necrosis scar formation within tumour tissue regard partial pathohistological response . Ethics committee approval Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty obtain participate study . Statistical analysis The characteristic patient assessable data compare X2 test Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Overall survival ( OS ) define duration diagnosis metastasis last visit death . Progression free interval ( PFI ) define duration diagnosis metastasis point disease progression detect . Complete response ( CR ) achieve systemic therapy evidence clinical disease ( NED ) local therapy consider relapse-free , duration induction relapse free status point relapse detection define relapse free interval ( RFI ) ; survival time induction relapse-free status without relapse define relapse free survival ( RFS ) . Unrelated death breast cancer consider censored evaluation PFI RFI . Survival curve calculate accord Kaplan-Meier method . The log-rank test use evaluate difference survival group intervention no-intervention . A multivariate analysis perform Cox regression follow variable include : age , DFI , performance status ( PS ) , liver metastasis , pulmonary metastasis , presence metastasis , hormone receptor status , HER2 status , Ki-67 status , intrinsic subtype , administration local therapy , chemotherapy regimen . Statistical significance define p value &lt; 0.05 . All p value calculate two-sided analysis . For observed survival , death consider event include patient die secondary cause without recurrence . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS 22.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) software .</detailed_description>
