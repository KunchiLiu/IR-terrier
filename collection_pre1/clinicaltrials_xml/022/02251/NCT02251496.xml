	<brief_summary>At least one fifth patient European hospital malnourish . Malnutrition associate negative consequence , include high rate complication , long hospital stay , impair wound heal increase mortality consequent effect cost healthcare . Evidence suggest may benefit malnourish patient receive oral nutrition supplement short-term know whether benefit sustain indeed whether similar benefit may achieve use food-based intervention low cost . The overall objective study compare two nutritional intervention among malnourished patient COPD ( n=200 ) ; oral nutrition supplement ( ONS ) vs. energy protein dense in-between meal snack hospitalisation home . Subjects follow one year . The primary endpoint weight change . Secondary endpoint include forced expiratory volume one second , force vital capacity , six-minute walk distance , hand-grip strength , health relate quality life , length hospital stay , energy- protein intake , readmission hospital acute exacerbation . No study available compare supply ONS malnourish patient COPD compare provision regular food ( in-between meal snack ) . The result study provide important information might improve nutrition care hospital set well discharge hospital</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COPD : Oral Nutrition Supplements vs. Energy- Protein Dense Between Meal Snacks .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients establish COPD admit Department Pulmonary Medicine Landspitali National University Hospital September 2014-September 2016 screen malnutrition use NRS2002 screen tool , recommend ESPEN . Those identify risk malnutrition able give inform consent recruit . According Hospital statistic previous study frequency malnutrition patient group , time frame recruitment long enough recruit 200 subject randomise two study group ( ~ 3 subject per week ) . The following baseline data collect order identify possible confounders . This include ; socio-demographic data ( age , gender , civil status , household size , family social network ) ; major medical diagnosis ; use medication ; GOLD score ( Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ) , depressive symptom , cognition ) , additional discharge intervention ( e.g . outgo hospital team , day care exercise ) ; use oral nutritional supplement . Inclusion criterion : - Newly admit patient &gt; 18 year old nutritional risk accord validate nutritional risk screen tool ( NRS-2002 , score 3+ ) - Able eat orally - An anticipated length hospitalization &gt; 3 day - Sufficient language proficiency Exclusion criterion : - Dysphagia - Food allergy intolerance - Anatomical obstruction prevent oral food intake Exclusion follow-up : Subjects withdraw consent participate . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint weight change one year admission hospital . Secondary endpoint include forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , force vital capacity ( FVC ) , six-minute walk distance , hand-grip strength , health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) , length hospital stay , nutritional status , energy- protein intake , readmission hospital within 30 day , well total number readmission hospital acute exacerbation follow-up . Functional outcome measurement conduct trained research assistant collaboration PhD student . Information background diet , HRQoL well compliance intervention diet gather PhD MS student . Measurements conduct admission hospital ( baseline measurement ) discharge hospital . Clinical examination Landspitali National University Hospital plan 3 , 6 12 month discharge hospital . All together aim five measurement point subject . Each examination take ~ 80 minute ( 30 min FEV1 FVC test , 20 min walk test measurement hand-grip strength , 30 min 24-hour recall HRQoL questionnaire ) . Additionally , subject contact least two occasion phone , week 2 6 ( interview ~20 min ) .</detailed_description>
