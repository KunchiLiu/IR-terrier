	<detailed_description>This aim study investigate prebiotic potential date fruit consumption healthy human volunteer compare diet contain date ; control ( maltodextrin-dextrose , 40.2g ) intervention treatment 7 date fruit ( 50g ) 22 healthy human volunteer . Each arm 21 day duration , separate 14 day washout period . Thus , also address fundamental question relationship fermentation non digestible carbohydrate , gut microbiota change faecal short chain fatty acid ( SCFA profile ) , ammonia bile acid . To end faecal sample , blood sample collect volunteer high resolution analytical technique ( High Performance Liquid Chromatography ; Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ) employ characterise whole system metabolic response ingestion date fruit compare control . Changes microbial parameter metabolite profile correlate change biomarkers chronic disease , include faecal water genotoxicity , cellular reaction , blood lipid bowel movement .</detailed_description>
