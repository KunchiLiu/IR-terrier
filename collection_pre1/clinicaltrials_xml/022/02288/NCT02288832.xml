	<brief_summary>Infection principal cause preterm birth . Most ( 90 % ) woman preterm delivery abnormal history . It widely agree preterm delivery often associate bacterial vaginosis . One major difficulty time diagnosis bacterial vaginosis base heterogeneous criterion . The technique currently use Nugent score , lack characteristic necessary widespread use general population . It must perform fresh swab , delay transporting cause dry make test difficult perform . The investigator develop rapid diagnostic tool bacterial vaginosis use molecular biology base point care model obtain patent ( European Patent Office NÂ° 2087134 ) . In comparison reference technique , tool 's performance excellent , term specificity , sensitivity , positive negative predictive value . In particular , work show 57 % flora sample rat intermediate Nugent score reality true bacterial vaginosis . Molecular biology therefore identifies homogeneous population woman vaginal flora anomaly . The investigator recently show carriage Atopobium vagina and/or Gardnerella vaginalis &gt; 105/mL shortens time delivery population risk preterm delivery ( PHRC 2006 ) . Vaginal flora anomaly therefore important target prevent preterm delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medico-economic Impact Screening Atopobium Vaginae Gardnerella Vaginalis Molecular Biology `` Point-of-care '' During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective use cost-effectiveness study assess medical economic impact new strategy screen subsequent treatment vaginal flora anomaly 20th week gestation- molecular biology technique ( PCR A. vagina G. vaginalis point-of-care testing ) test self-collected vaginal sample population pregnant woman low risk preterm delivery . There multiple secondary objective , include assessment effect strategy follow indicators- delivery 26 , 32 , 37 week . Methods-An open-label prospective randomize study compare 2 group different management pregnancy . Pregnant woman low risk , regardless symptom , randomize 2 group . The study include woman high risk preterm delivery . Innovative strategy ( group A ) - woman undergo routine screen bacterial vaginosis analysis self-collected vaginal sample innovative technique .</detailed_description>
