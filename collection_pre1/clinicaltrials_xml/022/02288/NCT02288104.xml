	<detailed_description>Interventional radiology medical sub-specialty radiology utilizes minimally-invasive image-guided procedure diagnose treat disease nearly every organ . The concept behind interventional radiology diagnose treat patient use less invasive technique currently available order minimize risk patient improve health outcome . For many year , surgery treatment available many condition . Today , interventional radiology treatment frst-line care wide variety condition . Patients offer least invasive option frst . It important get second opinion know treatment option consent procedure surgery . Interventional radiologist specialist minimally invasive treatment , unique breadth training provide consults every type specialist . Surgical removal liver tumor offer best chance cure . Unfortunately , liver tumor often inoperable tumor may large , grown major blood vessel vital structure . Sometimes , many small tumor spread throughout liver , make surgery risky impractical . Surgical removal possible two-thirds primary liver cancer patient 90 percent patient secondary liver cancer . The objective study demonstrate technical feasibility safety endomicroscopic image interventional radiology procedure two main indication : liver kidney . The Primary objective : To study demonstrate technical feasibility safety endomicroscopic image interventional radiology procedure two main indication : liver kidney . The Secondary objective : 1 . Assess safety use Endomicroscopic image interventional radiology procedure two main indication : liver kidney . 2 . Assess quality biopsy perform help Cellvizio . 3 . Build database image atlas define image interpretation criterion collaboration pathologist . Evaluate whether Cellvizio improve guidance biopsy ablation : instance , critical structure nerve vessel vicinity cryoablation area , possible visualize ice crystal therefore decide stop cryoablation right time/location ? For application , technical feedback physician expect think combine use device could change care path . E.g . certain step workflow might become obsolete workflow could lead few patient visit . For safety protocol , use endomicroscopy change way patient management standard procedure , include diagnosis treatment decision . All adverse event / serious adverse event note procedure one week procedure .</detailed_description>
