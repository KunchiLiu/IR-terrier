	<brief_summary>Due lack hormone overproduction non-functioning pituitary adenoma ( NFPAs ) , symptomatic adenoma large adenoma proven growth risk symptom near future undergo pituitary surgery . The remain adenoma monitor regularly . Operation large adenoma rarely remove tumour tissue , also risk worsen pituitary function . Often , adenomas high growth potential operate several time also need radiation therapy , provide additional risk pituitary failure ( 4 ) . Unlike hormone-producing adenoma , establish pharmacological treatment NFPAs . However , non-randomized study suggest treatment dopamine agonist may slow growth , also induce tumour shrinkage . At present , cabergoline dopamine agonist widely use treatment pituitary adenoma secrete prolactin . Aim study effect medical treatment cabergoline non-functioning pituitary adenoma change tumour volume .</brief_summary>
