	<brief_summary>This international multicenter , open-label , randomize control trial ( RCT ) single-agent intralesional PV-10 versus systemic chemotherapy intralesional oncolytic viral therapy ass treatment locally advance cutaneous melanoma patient ( 1 ) fail otherwise candidate target therapy ( 2 ) fail otherwise candidate least one immune checkpoint inhibitor . Subjects comparator arm receive Investigator 's choice dacarbazine ( DTIC ) , temozolomide ( TMZ ) intralesional talimogene laherparepvec determine Investigator preference standard care Investigator 's country region . Effectiveness assess comparison progression-free survival ( PFS ) intent-to-treat ( ITT ) subject two study treatment arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PV-10 v Chemotherapy Oncolytic Viral Therapy Treatment Locally Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize use 2:1 treatment allocation ( i.e . two-thirds subject receive PV-10 ) . Subjects comparator arm complete least 1 cycle study treatment meet study protocol definition disease progression evidence visceral metastasis eligible enter crossover portion study receive PV-10 . Subjects cross must meet study inclusion exclusion criterion clinical laboratory , thyroid function , concurrent intercurrent illness pregnancy time crossover . Assessment progression perform Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ver . 1.1 criterion . Events signal progression include increase size and/or number lesion , distant nodal disease progression , death . All secondary endpoint involve disease response progression base IRC determination . An interim assessment efficacy safety perform IRC 50 % event require primary endpoint occur .</detailed_description>
