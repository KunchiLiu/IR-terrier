	<brief_title>Clinical Sonoelasographic Evaluation Elasticity Uterine Cervix Pregnant Patients Term</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Softening uterine cervix pregnant patient term usually evaluate clinically subjective vaginal manual examination ( Bishop 's score ) .One variable score cervical consistency consider important factor.The cervical consistency describe soft , medium stiff.However , digital assessment consistency subjective less reproducible.The Bishop 's score also give information expect duration labor induction . The consistency uterine cervix also evaluate objectively sonoelastographically measure cervical elasticity.This illustrate color map , low stiffness ( soft tissue ) indicate red , middle stiffness green high stiffness ( hard tissue ) blue.In study aim compare cervical dilation time clinical evaluation cervical consistency quantitative measurement cervical elasticity pregnant patient term .</detailed_description>
