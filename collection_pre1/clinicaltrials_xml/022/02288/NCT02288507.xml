	<brief_title>Sorafenib Concurrent With Yttrium-90 Transarterial Radioembolization Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies Asia unresectable hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) demonstrate sorafenib could administer safely 400mg BID initiate 14 day follow radioembolization ( RE ) . However , ideal sequence RE sorafenib may completely elucidate , two treatment give concurrently may effective sequential approach study Asian trial . Preclinical model demonstrate sorafenib act synergistically radiation , increase apoptosis . Furthermore , case report suggest profound response patient receive sorafenib concurrent TARE evidence improvement symptom , &gt; 80 % decrease alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) , conversion unresectable resectable . Sorafenib concurrent TARE may take advantage synergistic relationship two therapy prove effective treatment strategy sequential administration TARE sorafenib .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm HCC clinical diagnosis American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) criteria cirrhotic subject require . ) Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B C. Segmental subsegmental portal vein thrombosis allow . Metastatic disease allow investigator feel liver direct therapy could offer palliative benefit ( i.e. , minimal extrahepatic tumor burden ) No evidence cirrhosis cirrhosis grade ChildPugh class A B7 . Eligibility Have least one tumor lesion accurately measure accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor ( RECIST v1.1 ) . Consultation interventional radiologist deem appropriate candidate TARE . Prior local therapy , surgery , hepatic arterial embolization , chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation , percutaneous ethanol injection cryoablation allow index lesion ( ) remain outside treatment field progress since prior treatment . Local therapy must complete least 4 week prior baseline scan . Prior 90Y TARE sorafenib allow Patient must inform investigational nature study , sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 . Have adequate hematologic function document ANC ≥ 1000/ul , platelet count ≥ 60,000/ul , hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 mg/dl obtain within 28 day prior registration . Have adequate hepatic function , determine follow test measure within 28 day prior registration : serum bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x IULN . Have adequate renal function , determine follow test measure within 28 day prior registration : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR measure creatinine clearance calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . Have life expectancy ≥12 week Must able swallow oral medication . Negative pregnancy test do ≤7 day prior registration , woman childbearing potential . Known suspected allergy hypersensitivity sorafenib . Any malabsorption condition . Must know brain metastasis . No concurrent anticancer chemotherapy local therapy . No concurrent herbal unconventional therapy ( e.g. , St. John 's Wort ) Pregnant nurse woman No prior radiation therapy liver Inability perform y90 TARE due : ( 1 ) inability catheterize hepatic artery , ( 2 ) portal vein thrombosis/occlusion without ability perform selective infusion , ( 3 ) Tc99m MAA hepatic artery perfusion scintigraphy show unfavorable shunt fraction liver pulmonary parenchyma determine interventional radiologist , ( 4 ) contraindication TARE identify interventional radiologist . Women/men reproductive potential unwilling unable use effective contraceptive method No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree 3 year . History myocardial infarction , stroke , ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic conduction abnormality within 6 month . Concurrent severe uncontrolled medical disease ( i.e. , active systemic infection , diabetes , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure ) , opinion Investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise ability patient complete study .</criteria>
