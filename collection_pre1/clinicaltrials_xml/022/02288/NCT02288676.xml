	<brief_title>DOvEEgene : Developing Validating Novel Molecular Screening Test Early Diagnosis Cancer Endometrium , Tubes Ovaries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vast majority death ovarian cancer high-grade serous cancer ( HGSC ) subtypes . The currently available test ovarian cancer diagnosis , blood tumour marker CA-125 transvaginal ultrasound scan ovary , poor sensitivity specificity therefore suitable diagnose early disease . Indeed , result screen trial suggest test woman general population ovarian cancer may harm good , due high proportion false positive result . Accumulating evidence suggest high proportion HGSC `` ovary '' actually start fallopian tube . The cancerous cell tube escape uterus eventually cervix . Furthermore , cancer present microscopic lesion tube capable spread ovary abdomen . As endometrial cancer , disease increase incidence . Approximately , 10 % woman endometrial cancer high-grade subtypes account almost half deaths patient endometrial cancer diagnosis result early spread . Combined , cancer uterus , tubes ovary account 3rd common cause death cancer high resource country . Thus , screen tool cancer uterus , tubes ovary would greatly benefit woman . Seminal work show possible identify cancer cell among thousand normal cell , cytology sample . More specifically , collect uterus , cervix vagina variety sample technique use innovative method DNA tag . We develop technology DNA barcoding . Additionally , also evaluate different method sample collection determine acceptable woman doctor , still yield high number abnormal cell . Our preliminary result indicate brush sample take inside uterus yield best proportion cancer cell respect ovarian/tubal cancer , well , uterine cancer . The objective project develop , building discovery , test use screen tool detect cancer endometrium , ovary tube , early stage . We enrol woman know suspected cancer ovary endometrium , well woman schedule undergo hysterectomy salpingectomy +/- oophorectomy variety benign reason serve control . We develop , refine technology validate screen test , DOvEEgene , specific safe screen woman order diagnose cancer uterus , tubes ovary early enough save life .</detailed_description>
