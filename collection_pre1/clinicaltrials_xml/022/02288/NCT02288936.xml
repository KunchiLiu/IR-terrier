	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common non-skin tumor diagnose men second lead cause cancer death men Western country . Between 10-20 % patient diagnose metastatic stage half diagnose early stage develop metastasis . After clinical benefit mitoxantrone improve survival 2-3 month provide docetaxel first line , second search drive look effective second line treatment . In recent year , new drug treatment prostate cancer , revolutionize therapeutic sequence survival . Thus , androgen deprivation therapy , treatment choice , induces improvement symptom approximately 70-80 % patient , limited development mechanism resistance androgen deficiency . Docetaxel first chemotherapy drug increase survival patient metastatic prostate cancer . The second cytotoxic drug approve second line treatment metastatic CRPC cabazitaxel . Enzalutamide improve survival patient metastatic CRPC progress chemotherapy also patient receive chemotherapy . To date , biomarkers available allow u identify patient clinical molecular view able benefit treatment option currently available . The presence TMPRSS2-ETS rearrangement show correlate efficacy clinical practice abiraterone . There scientific preclinical background make one suspect molecular alteration may influence way enzalutamide antiandrogen activity , determine date . The objective study determine whether efficacy safety enzalutamide , administer patient castration resistant prostate cancer prior administration docetaxel influence presence absence fusion gene TMPRSS2- ETS .</brief_summary>
