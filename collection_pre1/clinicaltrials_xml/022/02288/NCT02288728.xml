	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer one common gastrointestinal cancer , radical resection primary lesion combine dissection regional lymph-nodes acknowledge surgeon world . When compare advance upper third gastric cancer , proximal gastrectomy acknowledge standard therapeutic strategy early gastric cancer locate upper third stomach . However , due abandon anti-reflux barrier digestive system cause dissection cardia low esophageal sphincter , belching、hiccup、Acid reflux、heartburn、chest pain symptom well reflux esophagitis cause traditional esophagostomy permanently influence postoperative quality life patient . Nowadays , relationship digestive track reconstruction proximal gastrectomy postoperative quality life still controversy . Previous study report gastric tube anastomosis minimize reflux relate symptom compare traditional esophagogastrostomy . There still exit patient need long-term anti-acid drug control reflux symptom although underwent gastric tube anastomosis . The double-track anastomosis proximal gastrectomy may successfully control reflux symptom exist study find safe esophagostomy . But randomize control study compare postoperative quality life gastric tube anastomosis double-track anastomosis proximal gastrectomy . By reason , randomize control trial conduct intention compare intraoperative postoperative mortality morbidity postoperative quality life esophagogastrostomy double-track anastomosis proximal gastrectomy gastric cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) 1 . Preoperative evaluation Patients satisfied inclusion/exclusion criterion inform join clinical study signature inform consent . 2 . Randomization : Intraoperative evaluation find R0 , proximal gastrectomy perform , case entrance Randomization period . Random number computer-generated , third party application . 3 . Surgical procedure : The surgical treatment adopt proximal gastrectomy accord Japanese Gastric Cancer treatment guideline , 2010 , Version 3 . Group A take gastric tube anastomosis Group B take double-track anastomosis ( reconstruction method describe intervention section study group ) . The two study take similar surgical procedure except digestive track reconstruction . 4 . Postoperative recovery : Postoperative recovery period need collect relevant parameter patient . All relevant parameter definitely definition Case Report Form study include preoperative , intraoperative postoperative clinicopathologic characteristic . 5 . Follow-up : The follow-up study divide two part , postoperative quality life tumor characteristic outcomes . The information postoperative quality life collect European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORCT ) QLQ-C30 STO-22 questionnaire . At postoperative 12 moth , upper gastrointestinal scope need examine reflux esophagitis remnant gastritis accord Los Angeles Classification esophagitis . The tumor relate outcome include long-term postoperative complication , recurrence type , relapse free survival ( month ) overall survival ( month ) .</detailed_description>
