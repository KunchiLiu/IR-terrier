	<brief_summary>Rationale : Laparoscopic myomectomy increasingly perform laparotomic myomectomy , many benefit patient term pain , hospital stay recovery . In order increase success rate laparoscopic procedure pre-treatment decrease volume might beneficial . Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) use purpose good result term volume reduction , sometimes result loss distinction right surgical plane . Ulipristal new pre-operative treatment option symptomatic fibroid , demonstrate good result term volume reduction . The effect cleavage plane unknown . This study perform evaluate Ulipristal effective GnRHa term surgical outcome . Objective : investigate Ulipristal non-inferior GnRH term intra-operative blood-loss ( primary outcome ) , surgical time , surgical ease , complication , quality life cost . Study design : Double blind randomize control multi-center trial . Study population : Premenopausal woman maximum 2 symptomatic intramural fibroid 5 12 cm diameter remove . Fibroid type 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 2-5 include . Intervention : Three month Ulipristal 5 mg daily combine single saline injection onset pretreatment ( produce placebo Leuproreline ) ( comparison ) 11.25 mg Leuproreline injection onset pretreatment placebo tablet ( daily ) . Methods : Within 1 month pre-treatment patient undergo laparoscopic myomectomy experience surgeon . Operative characteristic record prospectively . Follow 6 month surgery mainly quality life assessment . A cost utility analysis conduct alongside trial . Main study parameters/endpoints : Ulipristal non-inferior GnRHa term blood loss surgery average difference two group 150 ml ( standard deviation 250 ml ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Both Ulipristal GnRHa register indication . Safety test specific risk apply .</brief_summary>
