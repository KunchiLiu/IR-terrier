	<detailed_description>Tremor salient symptom Parkinson 's disease ( IPS=idiopathic Parkinson syndrome ) . Other symptoms bradykinesia , rigidity postural instability . As much 75 % patient IPS show rest tremor . Initially , tremor typically unilateral visible stress situation . In late stage disease become bilateral . The OPINION trial aim investigation combine approach thalamic/subthalamic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment patient tremor dominant IPS patient equivalent type IPS perceive tremor dominant symptom . The planned approach first time allow direct comparison condition homogeneous patient population furthermore allow intra-individual comparison different stimulation condition ( Ventral intermediate nucleus ( Vim/DRT ) - Subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) - Vim/DRT+STN ) outcome parameter `` quality life '' . Patients register trial undergo screening procedure ( eligibility criterion please see Inclusion Exclusion criterion ) . If patient eligible Investigational Medical Device ( IMD ) implant ( Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation System manufacture Boston Scientific ) . After implantation IMD remain OFF period 1 month . 1 month implantation treatment start . Patients randomize one follow 3 treatment group : Subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) Ventral intermediate nucleus ( Vim/DRT ) combine stimulation ( Vim/DRT+STN ) . Patients undergo three treatment group last 3 month . The patient blind meaning study patient know kind treatment ( e.g . mode/region stimulation ) receive . 10 month implantation final visit ( end study visit ) perform . After end trial , treatment perform Department Stereotactic Functional Neurosurgery Freiburg ( Germany ) accord establish guideline . Devices monitor 3-6 monthly Patient 's medication adjust level best treatment adjunct stimulation . Study endpoint ( e.g . quality life ) evaluate blinded rater . In addition , external video rating perform .</detailed_description>
