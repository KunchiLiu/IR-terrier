	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome increase worldwide , include develop country . The metabolic syndrome compose clinical express symptoms central obesity , high blood pressure , raise fast plasma glucose diagnose diabetes , low HDL , raise serum triglyceride . All component together independently contribute development cardiovascular disease , lead cause death modern world . The result previous study show probiotic bacteria influence health improvement , exert positive effect diseases diabetes , high blood pressure , dyslipidemia low-grade inflammation , component metabolic syndrome . The objective study investigate probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 20 , Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 26 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG exert positive effect cascade molecular reaction level small intestine , remodel monocytes/macrophages adipocytes human cell model non-cancerous origin , provide scientific explanation mechanism possible multi-leveled activity select probiotic strain patient metabolic syndrome . For purpose , investigator divide research two part . The first part consist pre-clinical in-vitro laboratory study . It examine mechanisms action probiotic culture use functional cell model non-cancerous origin , specifically , use cell line human intestinal epithelium , human monocytes/macrophages human visceral preadipocytes . In in-vitro laboratory study , investigator demonstrate probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 26 exerts positive effect , could help relieve particular component syndrome host metabolic syndrome . The second part research consist prospective , double-blind placebo-controlled in-vivo pilot clinical study , include 16 volunteer metabolic syndrome . Results show probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 26 exerts positive effect reduction waist circumference , lower serum cholesterol concentration , maintenance serum adiponectin level . Those effect together contribute alleviation metabolic syndrome , especially term clinical manifestation risk relation cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
