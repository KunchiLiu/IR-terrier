	<brief_summary>Pain knee replacement impair recovery use new knee . Having injection numb femoral nerve know give good pain relief operation may lead slow mobilisation also prevent patient move knee . Recent study show infiltration local anaesthetic ( LIA ) within new knee joint may also give good pain relief . The null hypothesis difference primary secondary outcome measure femoral nerve block LIA , anaesthetic technique knee replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Compare Femoral Nerve Block With Local Anaesthetic Injection Post-operative Pain After Knee Replacement .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee pain stiffness common problem sometimes improve inserting replacement knee joint . An anaesthetist doctor specialises look patient undergo surgery , variety different anaesthetic use knee replacement surgery . These include general anaesthesia ( go sleep ) , spinal epidural anaesthesia ( pain killer inject back , result temporarily numb legs ) . Pain killer also inject around nerve supply leg , around site operation , combine general spinal anaesthesia require . Over year , multiple different combination technique try . All advantage disadvantage . Generally , completely numb leg operation often cause weakness interferes movement . Although patient pain , get around physiotherapist crucial weakness delay recovery . However , excessive pain also interfere movement . There therefore balance strike pain weakness , choice anaesthetic technique key . Researchers previously conduct study Royal Devon Exeter Hospital compare effect two technique ; use diamorphine spinal injection , injection pain killer around nerve supply leg ( femoral nerve block , FNB ) . Whilst research show FNB give good pain relief , still concern cause weakness may interfere movement . A new technique evolve recent year pain killer inject directly around knee operation . This known local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) potential advantage simple , safe cause leg weakness . If research show LIA provide adequate pain relief without weakness , may better option use routinely , rather FNB . The primary outcome measure amount morphine use first 48 hour . The secondary outcome measure Total Pain Relief Score ( TOTPAR ) , post operative pain score , ability achieve set rehabilitation goal , readiness discharge qualitative data patient recovery satisfaction .</detailed_description>
