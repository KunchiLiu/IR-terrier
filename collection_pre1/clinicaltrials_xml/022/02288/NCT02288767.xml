	<brief_summary>During enterectomy , especially open surgery , large amount fluid administer consideration patient 's fasted state , maintain blood pressure surgery potential third space loss . However , recently report excessive fluid administration surgery actually detrimental patient ' prognosis . In fact , several report suggest compare limited fluid administration , excessive fluid administration increase length stay chance complication . Thus , goal-directed fluid optimization require surgery proper amount fluid ( neither limit excessive ) administration minimize postoperative complication enhance prognosis . In general , amount fluid administer determined regard patient 's volume status , include comprehensive assessment vital sign pulse rate blood pressure , urine volume . However , method limitation inadequate indicator actual intravascular volume patient determine administer proper amount fluid . Recently , new method measure volume status less invasive accurate introduce . These method include stroke volume variation ( SVV ) monitor change arterial pressure waveform amplitudes regard breathing pattern . This effective method monitoring fluid responsiveness place catheter via radial artery puncture . The stroke output dependent preload , afterload , cardiac contractility . The cardiac output determine multiply stroke output heart rate . SVV indicate difference stroke output within one breathing cycle . A direct indirect measurement stroke output require , perform analyze arterial pressure waveform via FloTrac Sensor ( Edwards Lifesciences , USA ) monitor . SVV known high fluid responsiveness even open surgery , yet practically research data effect patient ' postoperative recovery prognosis comparison traditional method fluid administration . Therefore , investigator apply SVV via FloTrac/ Vigileo™ monitor patient undergo bowel resection determine whether good assist proper fluid administration compare traditional method fluid administration examine patient ' postoperative prognosis bowel movement recovery length stay .</brief_summary>
