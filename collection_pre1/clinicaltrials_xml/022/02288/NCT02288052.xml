	<brief_summary>The basal ganglia play important role motor learning , especially consolidation phase motor learning . This raise question whether possible sustain learn increment neurodegenerative condition Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The aim study gain knowledge whether possible relearn skill actually affect PD , writing , determine whether neuroplasticity possible . In randomize controlled study , PD patient either follow intensive write training placebo treatment ( stretch relaxation training ) 6 week . The write training focus automatization ( withstand dual task interference ) , transfer untrained task retention . The placebo program aim reduce stiffness upper limb show ineffective PD . To date , unknown neural network change result consolidation prolong period motor learn PD . Therefore second arm study investigate , first time , change neural connectivity use brain imaging data elucidate neuroanatomical region involve consolidation learn PD . Finally , DTI rest state fMRI-analysis complement insight neural change result learning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This translational study monocentric Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . The investigator recruit 40 PD patient early Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage . Patients randomly allocate experimental group ( write training ) control group ( stretch- relaxation training ) . All patient receive frequency duration intervention . After train period , patient follow another 6 week . Patients test ON-phase medication cycle 3 occasion : ( T1 ) training ( T2 ) 6-week retention period ( T3 ) . At T1 &amp; T2 participant test behavioral &amp; neural level . At T3 participant test behavioral level . Motor performance measure use MRI-compatible touch sensitive tablet pencil . This system allow registration translation write movement online-cursor movement screen outside scanner environment . Both patient group compare behavioral test battery consist ( ) train sequence without visual cue ; ( ii ) untrained sequence without visual cue test transfer ; ( iii ) train dual task test automatization . Visual cue consist differently color target zone different band width , indicate scale accuracy write . Functional MRI measurement take place 3T MR Philips Intera scanner . Before scan , subject undergo train session dummy scanner familiarize scanner environment task instruction . During fMRI session , participant perform train untrained sequence , without visual cue . To control difference movement speed , participant perform tasks frequency , define auditory pace . In addition fMRI measurement , rest state fMRI DTI also perform reveal alteration structural functional connectivity critical region . Behavioral data record xy-coordinates pressure value sample rate 200Hz spatial resolution 32.5Âµm . Statistical analysis behavioral data between-subject factor group ( experimental placebo group ) within-subject factor time ( training , train retention period ) . Image analysis perform Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM ) software . The investigator contrast either decrease increased activation , different region may show divergent change relate learn transfer , group between-subject factor time ( train ) task condition ( trained cue , train without cue , untrained cue untrained without cue ) within-subject factor .</detailed_description>
