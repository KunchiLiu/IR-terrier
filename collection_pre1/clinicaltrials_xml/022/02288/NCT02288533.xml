	<detailed_description>Consciousness disorder high impact society national health system . One disorder vegetative condition , coma , n't self environmental consciousness alertness , whereas minimal state consciousness least part awareness conserve . In Emilia Romagna region 80 people per million inhabitant hospitalized cerebral damage , discharge 1/5 patient stabilized consciousness disorder . The diagnosis disorder base neurobehavioural test , example JFK Coma Recovery Scale Revised ( CRS-R ) . In patient recovery state consciousness one main challenge . There little evidence treatment , propose use therapy could modulate central nervous system activity , like specific drug , neuroimaging neuromodulation technique transcranial magnetic stimulation repetitive transcranial current stimulation . A non invasive neuromodulation technique transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) modulate cortical excitability : cathodic current reduces excitability whereas anodic current increase . In conclusion , tDCS easy technique use , 's invasive 's efficient tool modulation cortical excitability demonstrate reliable result healthy subject . As tDCS modulate cortical excitability likely combination stimulation tool transcranial magnetic stimulation registration cortical excitability could give important information cerebral damage patient consciousness disorder test new treatment . It also likely modification cortical excitability could induce neurobehavioural change .</detailed_description>
