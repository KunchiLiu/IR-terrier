	<brief_summary>In study , doctor try see study drug call rituximab ( Rituxan速 ) low number B cell body . Doctors also try see decrease B cell rituximab ( Rituxan速 ) prevent injury transplant lung . This treatment study type solid organ transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B Cell Induction Pediatric Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive lung transplant risk rejection transplant lung ( ) . Rejection occur new lung trigger body 's defense ( immune ) system . When immune system trigger special cell send destroy new lung eventually lung may able function . These special cell include B cell . B cell important part immune system help body fight infection . One way B cell fight infection produce antibody . B cell antibodies produce involved kind rejection organ transplantation .</detailed_description>
