	<brief_summary>Disease aortic heart valve common progressively disable , effective medical treatment . In November 2011 , United States Food Drug Administration ( U.S. FDA ) approve new , less invasive transcatheter alternative surgical aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) . This new technology change treatment patient aortic valve disease . In , create press clinical need share decision making tool help patient understand risk benefit treatment alternative set individual characteristic . The overarch goal study develop new way approach treatment medical illness , focus expect treatment outcome individual patient use information collect large group patient . The corner-stone model public website design engage patient clinician personalized discussion treatment alternative . To achieve goal patient aortic valve disease , use exist clinical data Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) American College Cardiology ( ACC ) national procedural registry link Medicare claim patient follow-up 1 ) evaluate important health outcome surgical versus transcatheter AVR among patient would eligible surgical AVR , 2 ) create evaluate personalize decision assistance tool patient consider AVR . This work accomplish direct partnership patient caregiver well diverse group stakeholder help ensure usefulness dissemination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aortic valve disease common , progressively debilitate condition effective medical treatment . Surgical aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) standard care presence valve-associated symptom include heart failure , chest pain , syncope ; however , November 2011 , long-standing treatment algorithm disrupt United States Food Drug Administration ( U.S. FDA ) approval less invasive transcatheter alternative surgical aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) different profile associate risk benefit . This new technology create press clinical need share decision making tool help translate `` average-patient '' clinical trial result relevant `` patient-specific '' information empower individual face important treatment decision . The overarch goal study develop broadly applicable patient-centered paradigm treatment medical illness . The corner-stone model open-access , web-based resource engage patient , caregiver , clinician personalize treatment discussion . To achieve goal patient aortic valve disease , use exist Medicare-linked clinical data Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) American College Cardiology ( ACC ) national procedural registry . This work accomplish direct collaboration patient caregiver coinvestigators diverse stakeholder panel ensure wide utility dissemination . Specifically , achieve follow three research aim : Specific Aim 1 . Compare contemporary health outcome surgical versus transcatheter AVR among operable patient United States ; Specific Aim 2 . Create assess personalize decision assistance tool evaluate expect health outcome surgical vs. transcatheter AVR operable patient aortic valve disease ; Specific Aim 3.Develop ass personalize risk assessment tool evaluate expect health outcome transcatheter AVR inoperable patient aortic valve disease . Additionally , achieve general objective create evaluate web- print-based educational resource target dissemination patient aortic stenosis , caregiver , healthcare provider . The propose research facilitate well match patient exist treatment empower patient actively participate healthcare decision , thereby improve care patient aortic valve disease reduce overall healthcare expenditures . This study serve model promote personalize medicine among cardiovascular non-cardiovascular disease state . This study involve three primary comparison . The first treatment comparison surgical vs. transcatheter AVR short intermediate-term outcome ( stratify across important population subgroup ) —important result inform treatment discussion decision vulnerable patient . The second comparison outcome across comorbidity set use risk models—important result decision assistance tool provide personalize estimate risk patient , caregiver , provider select treatment strategy . The third impact evaluation educational resource , include comparison change treatment selection pattern clinical outcome across hospital geographic region high vs. low use web base educational resource—important comparison provide critical pilot information evaluate tailor resource impact .</detailed_description>
