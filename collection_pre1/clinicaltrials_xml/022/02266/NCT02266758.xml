	<brief_title>Randomizing Two Gestational Diabetes Screening Methods Diverse HMO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two recent randomize placebo-controlled trial show gestational diabetes ( GDM ) treatment ( vs. none ) improve maternal perinatal outcome , base diagnosis 2- step screen strategy . Also , large multi-center prospective cohort study show linear relationship glucose maternal perinatal outcome , base screen single 75g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Based large cohort 's finding , American Diabetes Association recommend clinical practice adopt 1-step 75g screen approach diagnose GDM . The American College Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology take opposite stance , recommend traditional 2-step screening : alone RCT outcome evidence . What urgently need best inform clinical practice health policy additional GDM treatment vs. control trial , pragmatic randomize control trial ( RCT ) test 2 recommended clinical strategy . To pragmatically address critical research gap , propose randomize estimate 17,626 diverse woman GDM screening ( 2-step vs. 75g OGTT ) part clinical care Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) Hawaii ( KPH ) regional health plan . The investigator use plan ' electronic medical record ( EMR ) system time GDM screen randomize woman . Both KPNW KPH region universally screen GDM 24-28 week gestation , part clinical care . By randomize GDM screen context clinical care , investigator : Compare GDM prevalence ( Aim 1 ) difference maternal perinatal outcome screen strategy ( Aim 2 ) . Determine concordance 75g OGTT GDM diagnose 2-step , among recruit sub-sample 1,000 pregnant woman KPNW KPH ( Aim 3 ) . The result pragmatic RCT expect help resolve current public policy debate potential benefit risk strategy clinical obstetric practice .</detailed_description>
