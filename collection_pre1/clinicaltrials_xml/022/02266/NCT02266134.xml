	<detailed_description>Depression remain among nation 's top 10 chronic illness , cost $ 80 billion annually . Depression call `` Common Cold '' mental illness , one serious risk morbidity mortality . There many evidence-based practice treatment depression , unfortunately practice remain largely unavailable client receive service community mental health center .

However , despite demonstrated effectiveness MBC , majority community mental health counselor ( i.e. , clinician ) regularly assess target problem symptom guide work course treatment . To knowledge , study date focus process implement MBC community mental health setting . The long-term goal research project provide generalizable practical recommendation implementation approach promote MBC use fidelity community mental health center . Specifically , study test standardize versus tailor approach implement MBC one nation 's large not-for-profit provider behavioral health service . Although touted superior , tailored implementation rarely compare standardized approach . Moreover , recent research demonstrate apparent need adapt evidence-based practice fit specific context implement , particularly sustain . This proposal reflect movement field implementation science plan adaptation test compare standardized version . The propose research three-phase , mixed method ( quantitative/qualitative ) study investigate effect two different approach MBC implementation clinician-level ( e.g. , MBC fidelity ) client-level ( depression symptom change ) outcomes . We focus contextual factor ( e.g. , attitude , resource , process , etc . ) may influence implementation process goal identify generalizable practical way bring MBC community mental health center treat depressed adult .</detailed_description>
