At least 2 site measurable disease per Cheson criterion ( must measure least 1.5 cm diameter 1.0 cm shortest diameter one diameters ≥ 1.5 cm ) , one must palpable easily accessible lowrisk site ( eg , inguinal , axillary , cervical , subcutaneous ) intratumoral injection ( denote `` Lesion A '' Treatment Cycle 1 ) least one additional untreated lesion locate outside radiation field treat lesion ( Lesion A ) accessible FNA aspirate . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) 0 1 Aged 18 year old Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL Serum creatinine ( Cr ) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN International normalize ratio prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy PT partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) must within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Activated PTT ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Female subject must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior take study medication childbearing potential define protocol . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must willing use 2 medically acceptable method contraceptive Day 1 120 day last dose trial treatment . The 2 medically acceptable birth control method either 2 barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method prevent pregnancy . The following consider adequate barrier method contraception : diaphragm , condom ( partner ) , cooper intrauterine device , sponge , spermicide per local regulation guideline . Appropriate hormonal contraceptive include register marketed contraceptive agent contains estrogen and/or progestational agent ( include oral , subcutaneous , intrauterine , intramuscular agent ) . Ability understand sign inform consent form ( ICF ) comply treatment protocol Diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy ( include immune modulators systemic corticosteroid ) within 7 day prior study enrollment . Positive hepatitis B ( HBsAg reactive ) , HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) qualitative , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) Diagnosis mantle diffuse largecell lymphoma , Grade 3B follicular lymphoma [ Harris , Swerdlow et al . 2008 ] gastric mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma Clinically significant pleural effusion Active infection include cytomegalovirus Pregnant breast feeding within project duration trial participation 4 month last dose study treatment . Autoimmune disease include systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , Sjӧgren 's syndrome , autoimmune thrombocytopenia , history uveitis , clinically significant Lymphoma involvement central nervous system Received prior therapy lymphoma Use investigational agent within last 28 day Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior enrollment . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( eg , uncontrolled hypertension , myocardial infarction , unstable angina ) , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication within 1 year prior Day 1 ( Visit 1 ) ; Grade II great peripheral vascular disease study entry Any significant medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality , difficulty comply protocol requirement may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate study History sensitivity component SD101 A diagnosis cancer within last 3 year prior enrollment know additional malignancy progress require active treatment .
