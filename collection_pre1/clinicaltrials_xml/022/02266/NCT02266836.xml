	<brief_title>MyndMove Therapy Severe Hemiparesis Upper Limb Following Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine efficacy MyndMove therapy early sub-acute , late sub-acute chronic post-stroke patient . Other objective include assess require dos electrical current amplitude , usability device , examine overall safety . Many individual experience weakness paralysis arm hand follow stroke . As result , often unable grasp reach object voluntarily difficulty perform basic activity daily live ( ADLs ) dressing , feeding , bath groom . Despite extensive rehabilitation program , many individual remain dependent others assistance ADLs . This unmet medical need remain focus wide range research effort . MyndMove newly develop Functional Electrical Stimulation base treatment design recover voluntary movement severely paralyzed upper limb follow stroke spinal cord injury . This study enroll stroke patient severe hemiparesis upper limb ( defined 1 ) UE-FMA score less equal 19 2 ) Chedoke McMaster Stage 1-2 arm hand ) . Three cohort patient enrol study include : - Early sub-acute stroke patient ( less 2 month post stroke ) receive therapy inpatient rehabilitation ; - Late sub-acute stroke patient ( post-discharge inpatient rehab le 6 month post stroke ) receive therapy outpatient clinic setting ; - Chronic stroke patient ( great 6 month post stroke ) receive therapy outpatient clinic setting</detailed_description>
