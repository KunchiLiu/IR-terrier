	<brief_title>Chronic Postconcussive Headache : A Placebo-Controlled Treatment Trial Prazosin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Headaches follow combat-related post-concussive injury common , patient increase frequency severity become debilitate . Posttraumatic headache ( PTHAs ) , particularly follow blast-related head injury , resistant standard headache therapy . The objective study evaluate effectiveness medication prazosin prophylactic ( preventive ) agent treat combat-related PTHAs . Prazosin generic drug originally market 30 year ago treatment high blood pressure . It subsequently find safe effective treating problem , include recently posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) disrupt sleep active duty Iraq/Afghanistan Service Members Veterans . In preliminary study , prazosin also find substantially reduce intensity frequency PTHAs population . This finding motivation behind study . The investigator ' hypothesis ( 1 ) prazosin effective placebo ease effect chronic PTHAs , include headache frequency , duration , severity , use abortive/analgesic medication , disability cause , ( 2 ) improvement headache parameter associate improvement sleep quality , PTSD symptom severity , mood , cognition , health-related quality life , global clinical status , moderation alcohol consumption . The total trial length 22 - 24 week . Following initial clinic visit determine preliminary study eligibility , 4-week pre-treatment preliminary screening period , participant keep daily headache diary . The purpose confirm eligibility randomization per inclusion/exclusion criterion collect baseline data headache-related outcome measure . Participants confirm eligible continue study one-week sleep evaluation include actigraphy keep daily sleep diary . This follow baseline study visit , baseline data secondary outcome measure collect use validate structured self-reports clinician interview . Participants randomize 2:1 prazosin placebo , study drug dose gradually titrated 5 7-week period 5 mg morning 20 mg even maximum tolerate dose . The dose titration follow 12 week steady-dose . For last week steady-dose phase , participant repeat sleep evaluation . Participants keep headache log duration study . Results analyze use standard statistical technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Veterans active duty service member age 18 old either gender military service time October 2001 present Good general health History blast and/or impact head/neck trauma meeting DVBIC criterion mild TBI , i.e. , injury manifest least one following : 1 ) period loss consciousness 2 ) loss memory event immediately accident 3 ) alteration mental status time accident ( e.g. , feel daze , disorient , confuse ) 4 ) focal neurological deficit ( ) may may transient , severity injury exceed loss consciousness 30 minute , Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 1315 30 minute , posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 24 hr , Headaches start within 30 day head/neck injury . Headaches must either 1 ) last 4 hour day reach moderate severe intensity point headache 2 ) may severity duration participant take medication effort stop headache . Headaches meeting criterion must present average least 8 day per 4week period 3 month precede study enrollment . Comorbid PTSD anxiety disorder exclusionary . Fluency English require . Persons race ethnicity eligible . Female participant must agree abstain sexual relation could result pregnancy use reliable form birth control study . Continued use prophylactic migraine medication study drug permissible participant stable dose least 4 week prior preliminary screening period intend continue medication duration trial . History TBI severe classify mild DVBIC criterion History penetrate head injury Acute unstable chronic medical illness ( e.g. , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within 6 month , congestive heart failure , symptomatic concern cardiac arrhythmia ; preexist hypotension ( systolic BP &lt; 110 ) orthostatic hypotension ( systolic drop &gt; 20 mm mercury ( Hg ) 2 min stand accompanied lightheadedness ) .

Other condition evaluate casebycase basis . Current substance use disorder per DSMV criterion except caffeine tobaccorelated disorder . Structural brain abnormality prior image associate clinically evident manifestation . Current participation transcranial magnetic stimulation study . Significant headache precede onset posttraumatic headache . Specifically , prospective subject may moderate severe headache occur 2 day per month average 5 lifetime migraine headache Continuous headache severity , i.e. , persistent daily headache headachefree period le 8 hour attack Unable reliably keep headache log minimum 80 % recordable day Women childbearing potential must pregnant , plan become pregnant study period , nursing . Participation headache support group activity meditation yoga intend mitigate headache chronic pain must stable least 4 week prior begin preliminary screening period intend continued duration trial . Participants encourage defer enrolling activity complete treatment trial . Medication Exclusions : Current use prazosin alpha1 antagonist purpose Allergy previous adverse reaction prazosin alpha1 antagonist Subjects must stable dose follow medications/treatments least 4 week prior preliminary screening period , must intend continue medication duration trial : psychoactive drug , example anticonvulsant , benzodiazepine , antidepressant , sedative/hypnotics ; antihypertensive medication , include beta blocker , calcium channel blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker ; magnesium prescribe specifically headache . Potential participant take trazodone undergo 2week washout period begin preliminary screening period . Because combine prazosin trazodone may increase risk priapism , trazodone allow study . Sildenafil ( Viagra ) , tadalafil ( Cialis ) , vardenafil ( Levitra ) , avanafil ( Stendra ) permit dose titration period , increase risk hypotension combination alpha1 blocker , allow half usual start dose follow study drug dose titration period , per VA prescribe guideline . Use butalbital within 4 week begin preliminary screening period end study involvement . Use supplement contain nitrate supplement contain stimulant ( ephedra ) within 2 week begin preliminary screening period end study involvement . Use prescribed stimulant ( amphetamine dextroamphetamine contain medication ) within 2 week begin preliminary screening period end study involvement .</criteria>
