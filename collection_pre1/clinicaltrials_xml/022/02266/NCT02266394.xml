	<brief_summary>Current treatment ARAS base restore blood flow alone unsuccessful recover kidney function . For reason study stem cell product call `` mesenchymal stem cell '' MSC . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) grow person 's fat tissue ( obtain fat biopsy ) infuse back patient 's kidney . This study also do determine MSC infusion prior percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty stenting ( PTRA ) enhance change single kidney blood flow restoration kidney function , well assess relationship MSC dose measure kidney function .</brief_summary>
