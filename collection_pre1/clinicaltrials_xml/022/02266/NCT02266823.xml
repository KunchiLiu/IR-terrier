	<brief_summary>The purpose study pilot test mHealth technology-supported behavioral intervention design engage patient diabetes concurrent chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) multiple behavior aim reduce CKD progression . Participants randomize 6-month lifestyle intervention wait-list control . The lifestyle intervention model use Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) counsel intervention base SCT , pair mobile technology-based dietary physical activity monitoring . The wait-list control receive 6 month standard medical care follow delay , less intensive , 6-month intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study develop pilot test lifestyle intervention obese individual t2dm concurrent stage 2-4 ckd . The counsel intervention base social cognitive theory support mobile ( ipad ) self-monitoring . Mobile self-monitoring feature intervention encourage vigilance diet manner burdensome , enhance self-efficacy integrating complex information regard ckd dietary regimen calorie-restricted diet , permit real-time monitoring weight , blood glucose , blood pressure , self-reported diet physical activity study team . Specifically , investigator develop method pilot test ckd lifestyle intervention stage 2-4 ckd patient explore impact intervention : ( ) weight fat mass , ( b ) blood pressure , ( c ) physical activity , ( ) urinary sodium excretion , ( e ) serum phosphorus calcium-phosphorus product , ( f ) kidney function measure serum cystatin-c , ( g ) serum lipid . Additionally , evaluate feasibility acceptability intervention term : ( h ) recruitment retention , ( ) time cost associate train ckd patient technology-based self-monitoring delivering intervention , ( j ) pattern self-monitoring adherence time , ( k ) participant satisfaction intervention . Finally , describe : ( l ) extent intervention differentially adversely affect nutritional health participant evidence low serum albumin serum prealbumin ; body mass index ( bmi ) fall 20kg/m2 ; subjective assessment nutritional risk ( e.g . Nausea , diarrhea , anorexia ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order eligible study , individual must 40 year age old ; DRG Code T2DM , GFR 1589 ml/min/1.73m2 BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 . The participant 's physician record verify his/her patient safely participant intervention study involve weight loss goal 150 minutes/week moderate physical activity ( comparable brisk walking ) . Those following characteristic exclude investigator : 1. unable unwilling provide inform consent ; ( 2 ) unable participate meaningfully intervention involves group session ( e.g. , due uncorrected hearing impairment , nonEnglishspeaking ) ; ( 3 ) unable read otherwise use iPad monitor dietary intake , physical activity , weight ( e.g. , blind , illiterate ) ; ( 4 ) unwilling accept randomization assignment ; ( 5 ) pregnant , plan become pregnant next 12 month , less 3 month postpartum , nurse within 6 week complete nursing ; ( 6 ) weight loss &gt; 10 % past 6 month except postpartum weight loss ; ( 7 ) individual institutionalize ( e.g. , nursing home personal care facility , incarcerate control diet ) . exclude study underlying disease would increase risk participate intervention involve caloric restriction physical activity . Such individual would include require treatment cancer , exclusive skin cancer melanoma , past 2 year ; infectious disease include untreated AIDS active tuberculosis ; uncontrolled hypertension &gt; 190 mmHg SBP &gt; 105 mmHg DBP despite treatment ; stroke TIA past 6 month ; condition require use home oxygen ; chronic disease condition likely limit life span &lt; 1 year . A recent Institute Medicine report suggest reduce dietary sodium 1,840 mg/day mid latestage heart failure may increase adverse event mortality . Thus investigator exclude heart failure . Because dietary requirement pregnant woman , nature weight loss gain pregnancy , inclusion pregnant woman study would confound study result . Those become pregnant study withdrawn study .</criteria>
