	<brief_title>Early Treatment Outcomes Pierre-Robin-Like Phenotype</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pierre-Robin sequence consist small low jaw , retropositioned tongue ( glossoptosis ) , optionally cleft palate , lead severe upper airway obstruction failure thrive ; occasionally even sudden infant death . Treatment approach heterogeneous , considerably invasive ; evaluate objective test . In longitudinal cohort study , want assess effect pre-epiglottic baton plate upper airway obstruction failure thrive use objective criterion ( mixed-obstructive apnea index assess polysomnography , standard deviation score body weight ) upon admission 3 month hospital discharge . The pre-epiglottic baton plate main treatment approach currently use Germany condition practise standard care three participate study center . These data help compare effect main treatment currently use Germany international data invasive treatment use rare condition .</detailed_description>
