	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment Progressive Scoliosis With `` NEMOST '' Growing Rod</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number scoliosis child remain progressive despite conservative treatment well conduct . Nowadays use treatment early surgical treatment spinal instrumentation without graft call `` grow rod '' . The use grow rod patient progressive scoliosis require several repeated surgery ( every 6 12 month ) order follow growth child . These repeat surgery lead significant increase risk complication , 's many team around world seek solution allow obtain rod expansion without repeat surgery . The purpose study evaluation use medical device perform correction scoliosis , time , preserve growth child 's spine . In addition , purpose clinical investigation test theory distraction effort may exercise without surgery thanks traction manoeuvre physiotherapy . This could allow obtain patient progressive scoliosis , correction spinal deformity avoid many repeat surgery . Our reference device grow rod `` NEMOST '' . When implanted , NEMOST rod immediately turn , correct maintain correction spinal deformity . After implantation , depend development Cobb angle , one elongation make slide notched portion rod tunnel distraction effort ( traction equipment physiotherapy ) . Therefore , growth device NEMOST allow continue , request , correction spinal deformity perform distraction external manoeuvre notch part without need surgery .</detailed_description>
