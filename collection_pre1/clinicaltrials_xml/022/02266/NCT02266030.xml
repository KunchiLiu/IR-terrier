	<brief_title>Effect Cilostazol Coronary Artery Stenosis Plaque Characteristics Patients With T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes increase exponentially , arouse serious economic , social health repercussion . Also , macrovascular complication diabetes myocardial infarct stroke increase . Individuals diabetes great risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , approximately two four time without diabetes . Currently , U.S. Food Drug Administration require demonstration new anti-hyperglycemic agent increase CV risk . The comprehensive multifactorial management type 2 diabetes , include control hypertension , dyslipidemia obesity , know significantly reduce risk CVD show Steno-2 study . However , anti-diabetic agent currently use clinical practice seem provide enough CV protection . This prospective interventional study assess effect cilostazol compare aspirin Korean T2DM patient atherosclerosis . T2DM patient coronary artery stenosis MDCT least 3 month prior investigation enrol . Considering drop due adverse event follow loss , sufficient patient enrol . Their medical record review relevant clinical laboratory finding collect . Cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) introduce early 1990s . However , electron-beam CT ( EBCT ) provide information simple coronary artery calcium score ( CAC ) . Recently , MDCT introduce , evaluate coronary artery comprehensively . MDCT image provide measurement CAC , degree stenosis , characteristic plaque include potential vulnerability . These finding MDCT report good agreement intravascular ultrasound . All scan analyze independently two experience investigator use 3D workstation , blind clinical information ( Brilliance ; Philips Medical Systems ) . After independent evaluation make , consensus interpretation arrive regard final MDCT diagnosis . Each lesion identify use multiplanar reconstruction technique maximum intensity projection short axis , two-chamber four-chamber view . Image quality evaluate per-segment basis classify . Plaque characteristic per-segment basis analyze accord modified American Heart Association classification .</detailed_description>
