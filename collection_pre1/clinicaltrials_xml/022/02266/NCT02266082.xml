	<brief_summary>Women early-stage breast cancer ( BrCA ) survive long , many experience symptom curative treatment . Approximately 50 % BrCA survivor experience persistent pain post-surgery . Identifying individual high risk long-term symptom important restore function enhance quality life . This pilot study investigate psychological ( depression , anxiety , catastrophizing ) biological ( inflammatory marker , gut microbiome , pain sensitivity ) correlate persistent post-surgical pain woman participant early-stage BrCA . The investigator also investigate type surgery participant whether related persistent pain . The investigator plan explore factor time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Post-Surgical Pain Women With BrCA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects participate brief telephone in-person screen determine eligibility study . The first in-person visit UF Pain Clinical Research Unit ( CRC ) schedule coincide pre-operative test clinic visit . During first visit , health information collect related eligibility criterion study visit proceed . The in-person screening process take 30 minute . The Informed Consent review make sure subject understand everything involve study . After consent , participant randomly assign , like flip coin , participant ID number know investigator . The participant may choose continue exclude study provide screen information . The demographic health information provide shredded . These name keep lock file , however , investigator n't contact screen . It indicate , next name ID number , reason exclusion study . A copy sign informed consent form remain locked file well documentation purpose . If select study agree participate , participant ask complete several test . These test take around 2 hour , do follow screen question first visit . The first visit take 2 Â½ hour . There second third visit ( approximately 3 6 month later ) UF Pain CRC follow-up testing . Each visit last 2 hour . Every effort make combine visit regular post-surgery follow-up visit clinic health care provider . Each participant 's hospital medical record associate surgery breast cancer assess amount pain experience follow surgery pain medication receive . Information relate type surgery ( i.e. , lumpectomy , mastectomy , reconstruction ) , result biopsy lymph node test , characteristic breast tumor , information surgery ( e.g. , type anesthesia , duration surgery , surgical complication ) collect . The following occur 3 visit center . Information health medication collect . At 2nd 3rd visit , change health medication since last visit collect . Blood pressure , heart rate , height weight information collect participant . Surveys participant 's thought feeling pain conduct . A trained professional draw blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) vein arm . This used measure laboratory value associate inflammation body . Specifically , investigator look biomarkers , chemical hormone might relate pain . They also check level vitamin D blood . No fasting require blood test . The stored blood sample label participant 's name . It label ID number . The sample store University Florida Clinical Translational Science Biorepository . The Investigators instruct participant use stool specimen kit . It use home return mail . A stamped envelope provide participant kit . This used measure microbes gut associate inflammation . The stored stool sample label participant 's name . It label ID number . The sample store researcher 's laboratory University Florida . If participant pre-menopausal woman , urine pregnancy test may require . Several test measure sensitivity tolerance pain perform . 1 . Pressure Sensation Test - applies pressure one knee , thigh , shoulder arm . The pressure may slowly increase , participant ask tell examiner begin feel discomfort mild pain . As soon pain felt , pressure remove . 2 . Mechanical Sensation Test - handheld probe small nylon tip tap knee hand . The investigator ask participant tell painful feel . 3 . Heat Pain Test - Sensitivity heat pain test use commercially available sensory test machine widely use clinical setting . The machine small square piece use apply heat skin . Heat apply one knee arm . The amount heat control computer . The procedure stop time participant experience pain unacceptable .</detailed_description>
