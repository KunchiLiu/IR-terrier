	<brief_summary>Influenza ( 'flu ) cause severe infection , especially people weaken immune system HIV . For reason , yearly vaccination recommend standard 'inactivated ' influenza vaccine try prevent infection population . It also recommend health care worker , help prevent spread influenza within healthcare setting . However , HIV infection may mean vaccine work less well people investigator completely understand . An alternative standard 'inactivated ' annual influenza vaccine 'live attenuate influenza vaccine ' ( LAIV ) , mean consists weaken version influenza virus . Unlike standard vaccine , give injection , LAIV spray give nostril . It give child UK preference standard vaccine result great protection influenza . In country , like USA , adult also give LAIV , seem work well standard vaccine . A study past show LAIV safe effective HIVinfected child adult . The investigator want give LAIV HIVinfected HIV negative individual , try find new information HIV infection may change way people respond vaccine . The investigator compare early genetic response vaccine later response cell specifically target fight influenza ( 'Tcells ' ) , group . In long term , investigator hope lead design new way improve response vaccine HIVinfected people . As LAIV give nostril , rather injection , investigator also want see LAIV result Tcells lung specifically target fight influenza</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Novel Mechanisms Vaccine Failure LAIV Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emerge field system vaccinology offer unbiased , global approach study immune response vaccine , unlike traditional reductionist approach focus specific arm immune system ( 1,2 ) . Recent work study response trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) intranasal live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) immunocompetent adult , show contrast early transcriptional signature elicit two vaccine ( 3 ) . LAIV induce type I interferon related gene , antigen present cell ( 3 ) mucosal IgA ( 4 ) , suggest protection may confer via mucosal immunity Tcells prim early innate response ( 5,6 ) , rather TIV induce systemic antibody response . This approach reveal novel insight early molecular signature ( e.g . expression Calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase IV ) correlate later humoral immune response , similar relationship innate Tcell response response LAIV remain unexplored3 . Influenza common respiratory viral infection HIV infect individual worldwide , great risk severe infection even antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) era ( 7,8 ) . Although immunization TIV reduce risk , vaccine HIVinfected individual ( 9,10 ) , TIV poorly immunogenic immunosuppressed new strategy require optimise protective immunity ( 1114 ) . A system vaccinology approach compare effect LAIV HIV infect uninfected adult could reveal novel mechanism vaccine failure suboptimal vaccine response turn lead potential way subvert immune defect ( 2 ) . LAIV license use healthy child adult age 2 - 49 year United States America . It also introduce vaccination child UK 2013 onwards , license use child adolescent age 24 month 18 year age ( include asymptomatic HIV infection ) . Although initial concern exist safety LAIV HIV infected individual , several study child adult demonstrate significant adverse effect ( 1518 ) . A large study administer either LAIV ( n = 122 ) TIV ( n = 121 ) HIV infected child ( mean age 12 ) find safety profile two vaccine similar ( include incidence pulmonary symptom ) , increase incidence injection site reaction TIV arm ( 17 ) . No effect CD4 count viral load observe . Approximately 23 % child find shed vaccine strain influenza within first week follow vaccination , similar rate HIV negative child . A study HIV infect ( n = 57 ) uninfected ( n = 54 ) adult also report similar safety profile , rate reactogenicity follow LAIV equivalent two group , also different placebo arm , increase mild self limit rhinorrhea nasal congestion LAIV arm ( 16 ) . Interestingly , contrast study child , one adult find shed vaccine influenza strain , likely due attenuate nature LAIV preexist antiinfluenza immunity adult . While traditionally HIV infection relative contraindication live vaccine administration , also good experience safely use live vaccine Yellow Fever vaccine subject CD4 count &gt; 200/mm3 ( 19 ) include travel vaccination guidance HIV infect individual meet criterion ( 20 ) . Recent guidance immunisation immunocompromised adult also recommend use live varicella vaccine HIV infect adult severely immunocompromised nonimmune varicella ( 20 ) . As live vaccine typically induce potent immune response inactivate subunit vaccine , approach warrant investigation HIV infect subject . While LAIV immunogenic TIV child ( 21,22 ) , data suggests LAIV TIV similar effectiveness prevent influenza healthy adult , despite low antibody seroconversionin LAIV ( 23,24 ) . LAIV likely confer protection via innate immune prim mucosal cellular response ( 3,23,24 ) . In addition , LAIV may provide protection mismatched strain influenza ( 21,22 ) unlike TIV , result protective immunity extend beyond year administration ( 25 ) . The importance Tcell responses reduce severity influenza increasingly recognise ( 26 ) may better correlate protection antibody elderly ( 2729 ) . Murine data demonstrate role LAIV elicit pulmonary influenza specific CD8+ Tcells , provide longlived protection subsequent viral challenge ( 3032 ) , although yet confirm human study . This protection appear extend heterologous virus , Tcell response direct primarily internal protein , conserve across many strain . This important , give ongoing threat new emerge influenza virus . HIV infected subject impair naturally acquire influenza specific Tcell responses blood lung ( 33,34 ) . No human study exist degree pulmonary Tcell immunity induce LAIV HIV infect immunocompetent adult . No study also use system biology approach study immune response live vaccine challenge HIVinfection . While HIVinfected subject may display aberrant systemic immune response LAIV , could also provide useful strategy induce potent heterotypic mucosal immunity population display suboptimal response TIV .
