	<brief_summary>Clinical experience show limited effect drug Loperamide use decrease output stoma patient . Therefore investigator see need randomize blind clinical trial determine effect Loperamide opposite Placebo . Loperamide evaluate relation follow parameter - Change ileostomy output g/day relation oral intake - Quantification change intestinal transit time use radiopaque marker - The patient´s assessment period receive Loperamide Placebo</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Loperamide v . Placebo 's Effect Ileostomy Output : A Clinical Randomized Blinded Cross-over Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study quantify effect Loperamide ileostomy output patient operate rectal cancer , ulcerative colitis patient short bowl syndrome . These patient recruit The Department Surgery The Department Gastroenterology , University Hospital Odense . The effect Loperamide evaluate Placebo relation follow parameter : - Change ileostomy output g/day relation oral intake - Quantification change intestinal transit time use radiopaque marker - The patient´s assessment period receive Loperamide Placebo Construction stoma frequently use part surgical treatment intestinal cancer chronic intestinal inflammation . More 60 % patient ileostomy develop dehydration loss salts mineral , due excessive stoma output . The common method use reduce stoma output Imodium® ( Loperamide ) . The effect never study extensively , probably counter medicine . The treatment relatively expensive also subject side effect , even mild . Therefore , investigator find relevant perform clinical study determine effect . The result important future patient treatment . The study clinical blind randomize crossover study . The study include three type patient . Patients operated rectal cancer ulcerative colitis temporary permanent ileostomy , patient short bowel syndrome permanent ileostomy . The first two type patient recruit two way . - During hospitalization connection operation The Department Surgery , University Hospital Odense . The patient offer inclusion study either surgery depend upon clinical situation . For consent fulfills inclusion criterion , study start 7th day surgery . - Through regular control stoma clinic . Patients short bowel syndrome offer inclusion contact The Department Gastroenterology , University Hospital Odense , meet criterion inclusion . Patients undergo period study . They randomize start either Loperamide Placebo . Each period consist 3 day . Day 1 - Uploading drug Day 2 - Collecting stoma output necessary Day 3 - Radiopaque marker collection stoma output every two hour After 7 day without medicine intake patient start second period opposite drug . During day 2-3 patient register weigh food fluid intake .</detailed_description>
