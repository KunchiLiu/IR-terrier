	<brief_summary>The World Health Organisation define chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) 'not one single disease umbrella term use describe chronic lung disease cause limitation lung airflow ' cover emphysema chronic bronchitis ; estimate ( 2004 ) worldwide currently 64 million sufferer 3 4 million UK . COPD result damage airways lung , cause become narrow make hard air get lung . It diagnose measure amount air expel first second breathing ( FEV1 ) litres per second . COPD progressive disease condition serious impact quality life sufferer . Going cold weather cause immediate drop FEV1 , increase breathlessness . This randomise crossover control trial participant COPD . It compare effectiveness air-warming face mask cover mouth compare face cover , increase participant exercise capacity quality life cold weather . The mask warm air mouth draw air warm beneath participant clothing , 20cm long hollow plastic tube one-way inspiratory valve mask . Air expire nose . 24 participant moderate severe COPD , undertake 3 exercise test 3 separate day . Two test environmentally control chamber perform 5°C participant wear either mask face cover . The third test perform ambient temperature outside chamber . The order determine random allocation . Participants undergo Treadmill 6 Minute Walk Test ; various measurement take , non-invasive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Air Warming Mask Exercise Patients With COPD V1.0</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose design Previous study demonstrate detrimental effect inhale cold air COPD sufferer [ 1 ] . Recommendations COPD sufferer suggest cover mouth mouth nose cold weather reduce impact cold air , date information effective actually . A previous study alternative mask involve 9 participant moderate level COPD [ 2 ] . A study need establish effective mask cold condition could simple , inexpensive way improve quality life exercise , deterioration condition result sufferer become sedentary.. A well understanding could useful clinician advise patient protect cold . NICE guideline publish 2004 2010 highlight importance pulmonary rehabilitation improve quality life COPD patient incorporate programme physical training , disease education , nutritional , psychological behavioural intervention . Exercise many health benefit , include reduce depression anxiety ; clinical depression anxiety common problem participant COPD . Exercise , perceive difficult COPD sufferer cold period due brochoconstriction ( constriction airways lung ) many sufferer confine indoors cold weather winter month . The primary aim study answer question whether face mask , provide air warm body bring mouth , increase exercise capacity participant stable moderate severe COPD , cold weather . Cold weather cause immediate drop FEV1 increase breathlessness discourage sufferer go outdoors winter . The sample size 24 participant determined power calculation trial statistician . The study design crossover trial , participant perform exercise test three time . The first test perform ambient temperature face cover . Participants health assess train use treadmill . The two test perform climate control chamber set 5oC , wear test mask wear mask face cover . The order two test determine random statistician . The participant dress feel appropriate cold winter 's day except scarf muffler . The study hold spring autumn avoid period cold weather also avoid hot summer month excessive heat equally trigger increased breathlessness COPD sufferer . The effect exercise exercise tolerance test COPD participant research document elsewhere purpose study [ 3 ] participant undergo rigorous exercise pattern full Bruce Protocol [ 4 ] ( standardise protocol monitor function exercise participant ) . The American Thoracic Society produce protocol Six-Minute Walk Test simple test measure distance patient walk hard flat surface period 6 minute ( 6MWD ) [ 5 ] . The 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) commonly use assess change functional exercise capacity COPD participant follow pulmonary rehabilitation primary outcome report distance walk test . Studies show 6MWT equally use treadmill [ 6 ] . The choice protocol make consultation respiratory clinician sport physiologist . The mask simple device comprise plastic face mask ( elastic strap ) plastic tube feed one way valve prevent moisture laden breath return tube . The wearer insert tube clothing inhales air preheat body . The device make medically approve , flexible plastic . The wearer inhale mouth exhales nose . The shape size mask determine research conduct Health Design &amp; Technology Institute base Coventry University configure fit majority participant gender ethnicity . The material chosen one softness sufficiently firm maintain shape whilst sufficiently soft comfortable worn next skin . Participants undertake three test three separate visit . The first test comprise walk 6 minute treadmill ambient temperature wear appropriate clothing mask . The two test comprise walk 6 minute treadmill inside environment chamber , temperature set 5oC wear warm air mask walk 6 minute treadmill inside environment chamber , temperature set 5oC wear face cover . The order two test participant determine random trial statistician . Pulmonary function assess immediately exercise test use spirometer . This measure airflow obstruction measure forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) ( total amount air expire one breath litres per second ) . Both measurement predictive COPD would expect FEV1 would decrease COPD sufferer breathes cold air . Participants also ask provide rating Perceived Exertion Scale ( rank 1 10 ) breathlessness Borg scale exercise test ( rank 1 10 write description level ) . If participant rank breathlessness 5 ( severe breathlessness ) exercise test stop immediately . Oxygen saturation heart rate continuously monitor exercise test . At end exercise test , participant rest period time monitor clinician . Full resuscitation facility available include defibrillator . 1 .
