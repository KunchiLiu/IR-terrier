	<brief_title>Developing Low-Intensity Primary Care Intervention Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal 3-year , 2-phase project develop AIM primary care linkage assess feasibility acceptability . This protocol description pertain Part A ( treatment development ) B ( open trial ) . As essential AIM eventually implementable practice setting , integrate implementation method early development work . We develop AIM meet exist need ( low-intensity anxiety disorder treatment ) , ensure fit local setting , identify eventual implementation barrier facilitator via open pilot trial . We strive develop pilot AIM manner perceive compatible exist practice , simple use , advantageous relative exist practice , beneficial . In order conduct ongoing evaluation , team `` end user , '' include Primary Care Physicians ( PCPs ) , nurse , patient practice leader Family Care Center ( FCC ) Memorial Hospital Rhode Island , study site , sit Rhode Island Massachusetts , participate Advisory Panel ( AP ) . Part A : develop AIM include : 1 ) personalization computer program create idiographic stimulus set participant use treatment ; 2 ) self-administered , personalize , Cognitive Bias Modification treatment ; 3 ) protocol primary care link delivery . Part B : open trial AIM comprise 3 iteration 6 patient . After iteration , study team AP review data feasibility acceptability AIM delivery method , make revision need . 8 primary care patient primary Generalized Anxiety Disorder , Social Anxiety Disorder , and/or Panic Disorder ( without Agoraphobia ) enrol , 3 iteration . Full assessments occur pre- post-treatment . Weekly measure anxiety depression collect , feedback patient PCPs research delivery procedure . At end 1st iteration ( n=6 ) , research team AP discus compare actual data target outcome . Target outcomes chosen face validity , clinical experience , , available , relevant literature ( e.g. , efficacy target base previous trial deem clinically meaningful change low-intensity treatment ) . Deviations target outcome prompt investigation discussion , possible revision AIM research procedure . After revision , recruit 6 new patient 2nd iteration . At end iteration , team AP review data make change need . We repeat process 3rd iteration ( n=6 ) . Part C include randomize controlled trial final protocol .</detailed_description>
