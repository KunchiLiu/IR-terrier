To examine immediate prolonged effect ( seven day ) Kinesio® Tape ( KT ) balance subject chronic ankle instability use Computerized dynamic posturography ( CDP ) . Design . A 7 day follow-up , single-blind randomize controlled trial . Setting . University community . Participants . A sample 30 subject age 18 28 CAI subjective perception ankle instability ( FAI ) enrol study . Interventions . Participants randomly divide two group : experimental group apply KT , control group apply placebo tape . Main Outcome Measure ( ) . The CDP device employ study Smart Equitest® version 8.2 . CDP analysis conduct use Sensory organization test ( SOT ) . The composite SOT score ( COMP ) composite SOT strategy ( STR ) , partial score SOT condition 2 ( SOT 2 ) strategy ( STR 2 ) consider outcomes measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants randomly distribute ( use QuickCalcs application GraphPad Software ) two group : experimental group apply KT , control group apply placebo tape . All outcomes group assess assessor blind subject´s allocation . Individuals also blind allocation group . Balance assess use SOT three condition : ( 1 ) without tap ; ( 2 ) immediately follow application ; ( 3 ) follow 7 day use . Computerized dynamic posturography use measure balance . Subjects maintain COG stable 3 consecutive series 20 duration 6 condition test . In first 3 condition , platform remain fixed . Condition 1 conduct open eye , condition 2 close eye condition 3 mobile visual environment reference postural oscillation . Conditions 4 , 5 6 repeat visual condition first 3 test add platform movement reference anteroposterior oscillation subject , ankle-foot angle remain constant , thus annul proprioceptive sensory input . The system utilizes force-plate technology ( two 23 × 46 cm footplate ) determine location COG within predefined 75 % limit stability adjust individual subject 's height ( COG = 0.55 × height ) . For test , software provide measure postural sway ability maintain COG within predefined target area result partial score condition overall balance score ( composite SOT score , COMP ) ( % ) . The theoretical maximum displacement normal subject may sway without fall assume 12.5 degree ( 8.25 degree anterior , 4.25 degree posterior ) . The equilibrium score = 12.5 - Ɵ ( maximum - minimum ) /12.5 × 100 % , Ɵ maximum anteroposterior COG sway angle record trial . Values close 100 % indicated minimum balancing . Test score value 0 patient need help take step maintain balance . SOT condition 2 best trial order ass influence KT proprioceptive system subject without vestibular deficit . As primary outcome measure , composite SOT score ( COMP ) composite SOT strategy ( STR ) , choose . The partial score SOT condition 2 ( SOT 2 ) strategy ( STR 2 ) consider secondary outcome measure . SOT condition 2 carry closed eye . Therefore , balance condition control mainly proprioceptive system , , accord several author , KT could effect . Under All subject initially familiarize CDP undergo . Multiple baseline measure SOT administrate order document change due tape application avoid learn effect.26 It suggest short-term adaption reduce postural sway either increase stiffness ankle reweighting sensory information .</detailed_description>
