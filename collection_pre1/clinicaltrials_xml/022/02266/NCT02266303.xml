	<detailed_description>Introduction The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus increase worldwide disproportionate increase develop country [ 1 ] . The burden tremendous develop country , great increase expect time . For example , prevalence diabetes adult North American Caribbean region expect increase 37 % 2035 . However , increase Africa South Central America time period expect 109 % 60 % respectively [ 1 ] . This crisis compound demand financial resource place high cost care . Estimated cost diabetes care reach $ 239.2 billion United Sates Dollars ( USD ) 2013 The North American Caribbean region [ 2 ] . Abdulkadri et al estimate economic cost diabetes hypertension four Caribbean country ( Barbados , Jamaica , Trinidad Tobago The Bahamas ) 2001 753 million USD per year [ 3 ] . The management type 2 diabetes evolve algorithmic approach [ 4 ] , towards individualize care [ 5 , 6 ] , affordability limit treatment option many develop country . The evolution driven increase availability drug use diabetes treatment . However , drug availability equally penetrate developed develop world due cost . Insulin cheap form ( animal human administer syringe ) therefore remain critical management diabetes develop world give low cost great efficacy . For example , Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor cost approximately twice month 's supply syringe deliver , intermediate human insulin , dose 40 unit daily . However , potential reduction HbA1C 0.5-0.8 % DPP-4 inhibitor much 3.5 % insulin titration [ 7 ] . Even develop world , global financial crisis may result similar shift low income group . It therefore critical healthcare professional know safely initiate insulin . For insulin safely use , particularly needle syringe method , healthcare professional must adequately educate patient number area . These area include side effect , draw administration insulin , recognition treatment hypoglycaemia . Given complexity task area may recall health care professional patient encounter . The task insulin initiation simplify use checklist . Ely colleague believe checklist alternative reliance memory reduce diagnostic error [ 8 ] . Depending solely recall likely open gateway omission , particularly give poor representation structure teach insulin initiation undergraduate medical training . An insulin initiation checklist also simultaneously provide education healthcare professional use insulin . Using human patient simulation evaluate potential safety benefit use checklist insulin initiation syringe method . Human patient simulation allow assessment clinical knowledge skill without expose individual risk . Research hypothesis ( alternate ) The use checklist insulin initiation via needle syringe , improve patient education safe effective insulin use . Methods Trial design We conduct randomize control study . Participants complete simulation insulin initiation twice . Participants randomly assign follow group simulation separate 5 10-minute period outline : Group 1 ( intervention group ) - Participants complete simulation without checklist . They introduce checklist allow ten minute review . They subsequently repeat simulation use checklist . Group 2 ( control group ) - Participants complete simulation initially without checklist , group 1 . They allow ten minute reflect exercise . They subsequently repeat simulation exercise , without availability checklist . The study design attempt ensure improvement identify association checklist attribute use learn effect previous skill . Performance simulation assess aid check sheet . Educational task list sheet heading 'Side Effects ' , 'Hypoglycemia ' , 'Drawing insulin ' , 'Administration insulin ' 'Other ' . Tick box use check whether task perform adequately , inadequately . Each task brief note constitute adequate performance . The Checklist The checklist develop taskforce . The group consist 11 individual ; layperson , pharmacist , two dietitian , two diabetes educator , podiatrist , diabetes specialist nurse , pediatrician two diabetologists . The process lead pharmacist , diabetes specialist nurse one diabetologists . The first version create three healthcare professional lead process , however final version achieve four iterative cycle feedback re-design . The aim develop simple A4 size , two side , document could easily copy . Eleven checklist item agree upon cover twenty-one key educational point safe effective insulin initiation . These educational point fell four theme â€” insulin side effect , recognition treatment hypoglycemia , draw insulin syringe , administration insulin . Images illustrate process use syringe draw insulin vial well injection site ( child , adult pregnant woman ) include back . There also space provide documentation client 's name registration number , insulin type take , medication stop , date signature facilitator . Setting simulation The intern ask complete simulation Clinical Skills Building The University West Indies . Established practitioner simulation carry office . During simulation actor/actress require education use administration insulin via needle syringe . The participant give equipment ( insulin syrinx needle , injection pad insulin ) instruction exercise , include clinical scenario . Analysis Chi-squared analysis establish whether intervention control group equivalent respect demographic variable ( age , gender , etc ) . The paired t-test determine difference pair measurement performance within group , student t-test group . If necessary assumption apply , Wilcoxon rank sum test Wilcoxon signed- rank test use respectively . Associations demographic variable outcome variable determine use Pearson 's correlation coefficient .</detailed_description>
