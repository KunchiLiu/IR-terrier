	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Performance , Usability , Safety Microwave Technology When Collecting Data From Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After write informed consent acquire physical examination perform followed confirmation inclusion/exclusion criterion . After subject enrollment microwave measurement perform . The procedure take approximately 15 minute ( duration actual measurement &lt; 1 minute ) interfere patient 's standard care Stroke Unit . The measurement data evaluate presence signal artifact . The diagnostic ability device evaluate use leave-one-out cross validation method CT diagnosis ground truth . Microwave signal sensitive dielectric parameter investigate object . In biological matter often related amount water . Brain tissue different dielectric property blood . The physiological change inside brain occurs result stroke change dielectric parameter .</detailed_description>
