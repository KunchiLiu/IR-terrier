	<brief_summary>The potential long-term effect Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) poorly understood . Repeated concussion associate elevated incidence Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) along reduce age onset . As repetitive TBI study , syndrome identify : chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) . There grow concern long-term neurologic consequence head impact exposure routine participation contact sport ( e.g. , boxing , football ) . Brain autopsy athlete confirm CTE demonstrate tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangle neuropil thread ( know tauopathy ) . The relationship exposure repetitive head impact subsequent development chronic neurodegenerative disease establish . Further , diagnosis CTE ( define presence tauopathy ) presently make death autopsy , clinical tool biomarkers detect remain define . With advent FDA-approved PET amyloid imaging , clinicians researcher able estimate plaque density brain live patient . However , critical limitation amyloid image . Current evidence suggest marker presence severity tauopathy may able address limitation . The study utilize [ 18F ] Florbetapir [ 18F ] -T807 PET image investigate amyloid tau accumulation subject history concussion . In order determine whether problem cognition memory see within population define study , researcher administer core battery neurocognitive testing . This battery assess cognitive ability commonly affect TBI , include process speed , reaction time , new problem-solving , executive function , attention concentration , learn memory . These test , conjunction imaging , able determine whether regional brain activity associate specific cognitive problem . The researcher obtain PET neurocognitive data 3 cohort : subject history TBIs , subject mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) TBI history , healthy control . The investigator aim determine whether individual TBI trajectory neurodegenerative disease see AD CTE . Because overlap clinical/cognitive behavioral symptom AD CTE , additional biomarker tool need prevent misdiagnosis . Accurate diagnosis crucial order provide patient appropriate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study involve two day study visit . Subjects give copy consent form morning first visit , sign consent private room Mount Sinai research related procedure conduct . Subjects bring Hess Center Science Medicine injection [ 18F ] AV-45 ( Amyvid ) PET scan . On second visit , conduct day first visit , subject [ 18F ] AV-1451 ( T807 ) PET scan complete neuropsychological test battery . Both PET scan do entirely purpose research . The scan read nuclear medicine physician clinical report send PI . Any clinically relevant finding send treat physician communicate patient . During visit , subject allow time meal break study procedure . Details procedure : Amyvid PET scan : At first visit , participant Amyvid PET scan . The scan involves use `` tracer '' , radioactive sugar-like substance . This type PET scan involves tracer call AV-45 ( also know Florbetapir , trade name Amyvid ) . It approve FDA use PET imaging . It bind beta-Amyloid plaque may may present brain . Amyloid plaque sticky substance ( protein ) accumulate brain large amount people may Alzheimer 's disease . A thin line insert vein one arm injection tracer . Subjects begin Amyvid PET scan 50-60 minute injection tracer , scan 20 minute . T807 PET scan : On day second visit , participant [ F18 ] AV-1451 PET scan , also know T807 PET scan . This type PET scan study FDA diagnostic tool . This PET scan involves similar procedure Amyvid PET scan day . Like Amyvid scan , thin line insert vein one arm injection AV-1451 radiotracer . This tracer bind cluster Tau protein inside brain call neurofibrillary tangle . These tangle associate Alzheimer 's disease memory problem may relate multiple head injury concussion . Scanning begin 80 minute injection tracer , last 20 minute . Neuropsychological test battery : The neuropsychological assessment battery pencil paper test measure memory thinking ability . In total take two hour complete .</detailed_description>
