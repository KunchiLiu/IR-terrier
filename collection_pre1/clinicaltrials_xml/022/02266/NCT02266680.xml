	<detailed_description>This exploratory 8-week study randomize control , parallel group design , carry two phase : 1 ) 8-week treatment phase 2 ) 3-month follow-up phase . 60 patient meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV Text Revision , ( DSM-IV-TR ) , diagnostic criterion social anxiety disorder recruit . Patients provide write consent , meet study criterion , stabilize pharmacotherapy enrol study . In treatment phase , patient randomize , one two group 1 ) Breathing Focused Yoga ( BFY ) ; 2 ) wait-list group . A sub-set 15 drug- naïve patient match healthy control undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan yoga treatment . A blood sample genetic analysis take SAD patient , investigate presence gene link SAD treatment response . The primary aim study determine safety effectiveness Breathing Focused Yoga ( BFY ) improve symptom SAD . There two secondary aim : 1 . To enhance limited research data effect treatment neural circuitry SAD , investigator also conduct fMRI scan SAD patient match healthy control pre- post-BFY intervention . 2 . As well , add literature genetics SAD , investigator validate link specific gene polymorphisms SAD already identify literature , evaluate predict treatment response follow BFY intervention . Primary Hypotheses 1 . Subjects Social Anxiety Disorder show significant improvement symptom BFY , compare wait-list group . 2 . Improvement quality life score significantly great BFY group compare wait-list group . Secondary Hypotheses 1 . At baseline , fMRI indication neural circuitry SAD subject differ healthy control . 2 . After yoga treatment , fMRI indication neural circuitry treatment responder SAD group similar healthy control . 3 . The presence specific gene polymorphisms SAD patient predict treatment response .</detailed_description>
