	<criteria>Patient CRS confirm CT scan define symptom last longer 12 consecutive week duration inflammation mucosa nose paranasal sinus . Patient clinical indication consent ESS include bilateral frontal sinus surgery . Chronic sinusitis diagnosis confirm documented CT scan within 6 month procedure . Patient bilateral disease frontal sinus confirm LundMackay score â‰¥1 side . Planned sinus surgery include bilateral ethmoidectomy ( judged necessary ) frontal sinus enlargement use Draf II ( A B ) dissection balloon dilation , minimum 5mm diameter opening create . Technique use frontal sinus surgery side ( e.g . surgical dissection alone bilaterally , balloon dilation alone bilaterally , bilaterally ) Septoplasty access ostiomeatal complex permit . ESS include bilateral frontal sinus surgery successfully complete without significant complication , opinion investigator , would confound study result , patient 's anatomy remain amenable implant placement . Known history immune deficiency immunoglobin G A subclass deficiency , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Oralsteroid dependent condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma condition Known history allergy intolerance corticosteroid mometasone furoate Clinical evidence acute bacterial sinusitis Clinical evidence suspicion invasive fungal sinusitis ( e.g. , bone erosion CT scan , necrotic sinus tissue ) Active viral illness Concurrent condition require active chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy management disease Clinical evidence disease condition expect compromise survival ability complete followup assessment 90 day followup period Currently participate another clinical trial History insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Patient previously undergone ESS experience CSF leak compromise vision result complication prior ESS procedure Significant complication current frontal sinus surgery procedure excessive blood loss , CSF leak puncture lamina papyracea Current ESS include frontal sinus surgery abort reason . At least one side amenable implant placement .</criteria>
