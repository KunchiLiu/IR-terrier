	<brief_summary>The overall goal study evaluate motivation readiness change influence context smoking cessation attempt . A total 60 adult ( i.e . age 18-55 ) smoker ( N=40 ADHD ; N=20 without ADHD ) interest quit enrol 3-arm trial allocate follow . Twenty ADHD smoker 20 non-ADHD smoker assign traditional 8-week contingency management intervention monetary payment make contingent upon biologically verify evidence smoke abstinence . The 20 additional ADHD smoker assign treatment-as-usual condition ( nicotine replacement ; supportive counseling ) . During treatment phase , subject require answer question 4x/week daily life via EMA ( Ecological Momentary Assessment ) . Specific Aim 1 : To assess motivation quit smoking readiness change prior quit attempt treatment seek ADHD non-ADHD smoker . Hypothesis 1a : The investigator hypothesize prior quit attempt , smoker ADHD exhibit significantly low level intrinsic motivation quit , equal high level extrinsic motivation quit compare smoker without ADHD . Hypothesis 1b : The investigator hypothesize smoker ADHD exhibit relatively less readiness change smoker without ADHD . Specific Aim 2 : To assess baseline level motivation quit readiness change influence quit attempt function ADHD status treatment modality . Hypothesis 2a . The investigator hypothesize CM intervention result relatively great change extrinsic motivation quit versus intrinsic motivation quit , effect pronounce among ADHD smoker . Hypothesis 2b : The investigator hypothesize overall motivation quit ( intrinsic extrinsic ) readiness change significantly influence CM intervention versus treatment usual among ADHD smoker . Exploratory Aim 1 : To assess relative efficacy CM intervention versus treatment usual smoker ADHD . The investigator hypothesize CM effective promote short-term ( 4-8 week ) smoke abstinence , well promote longer-term ( 3-6 month ) smoke cessation . Exploratory Aim 2 : To assess association among smoke withdrawal/craving , affect , ADHD symptom , motivation quit/readiness change .

	<detailed_description>Individuals ADHD alter reinforcement/motivational functioning likely relate risk smoke recalcitrance quitting . The investigator lab demonstrate abstinence-induced reinforcing effect cigarette smoke pronounce ADHD smoker . However , spite increase demonstrate difference withdrawal severity , intervention provide reinforcement contingent abstinence appear work well smoker ADHD . To date , study explicitly investigate motivational process associate smoke cessation attempt ADHD smoker . The propose pilot research therefore highly innovative since evaluate process change influence outcome two different kind smoke cessation intervention . The project also provide important pilot data potential difference ADHD non-ADHD smoker context contingency management ( CM ) trial , help guide development refine targeted cessation intervention high risk group smoker .</detailed_description>
