	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate implement evidence-based lifestyle-integrated strength balance exercise ( LiFE ) intervention primary care promote increase physical activity ( PA ) improvements function quality life old adult 75 year old . This study evaluate public health impact LiFE intervention use RE-AIM model : reach ( recruitment ) , effectiveness ( PA level ) , adoption ( physician acceptance ) , implementation ( fidelity ) , maintenance ( retention , adherence ) . If intervention appear feasible , use resultant information design large pragmatic trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Implementation LiFE Program Primary Care Older Adults Aged 75 Years Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity numerous health functional benefit old adult , include increase lifespan , perform daily activity well , improve quality life . However , engage old adult multiple chronic disease traditional exercise program challenge . Community exercise program may meet need frail old adult accessible physical limitation travel require . Although structured , supervised exercise effective , may realistic implement population-wide basis . Although substantial evidence demonstrate exercise improve multiple health outcome , limit research define exercise implement practice engage old adult chronic disease . Declines person-centered outcome ( e.g. , function , quality life ) increase risk fall , cardiovascular event , fracture occur age may amenable intervention . Primary care ideal set identify elderly patient need exercise intervention . However , cost-effective , generalizable model chronic disease management old adult use exercise setting remain elusive . Further , delivery individualized exercise prescription old adult may feasible . A recent study demonstrate teach old adult integrate exercise daily life activity effective reduce fall improve function old adult faller . In addition , evidence integrate balance strength exercise activity daily live may promote long-term exercise participation , `` institute new habitual behavior within select situational context serve prompt action '' . Therefore , propose physiotherapist-led group-based lifestyle-integrated functional exercise intervention deliver primary care timely . Recently announce change fund allow physiotherapist work within family health team . However , guideline physiotherapy resource allocate . This pilot feasibility study evaluate use resource efficiently chronic disease management older adult via novel intervention teach lifestyle-integrated therapeutic exercise . The long-term aim improve capacity care provider interdisciplinary set offer patient-centered care include exercise older adult 75 year old . Thus , propose evaluate pragmatic implementation group-based intervention primary care teach old adult integrate functional balance strength exercise daily activity relevant strategy , also know Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise ( LiFE ) program . The LiFE program propose strategy engage old adult sustainable exercise participation improve chronic disease management quality life . Our research objective related feasibility , retention , adherence include : ( 1 ) evaluate number participant recruit 6 month : The intervention consider feasible recruit 32 participant 6 month . Data collect screen program Centre Family Medicine 6 month show recruit 198 individual regularly exercise 59 individual agree receive information exercise . Recruitment 32 participant one site 6 month translate 576 participant 3 site three year ; ( 2 ) determine intervention retention rate : The intervention consider feasible 75 % sample complete 6 month follow-up assessment ; 3 ) determine adherence exercise intervention : The intervention consider feasible 50 % participant complete balance strength activity ≥3 day per week 6 month study period . Our criterion base randomize control trial data exercise fall prevention research show completion balance strength exercise ≥ 3 time per week positively associate fall outcome . In another study , mean number day balance strength activity complete per week final month LiFE program 3.89 maximum 7 day . Notably , 47 % adherence LiFE program first 6 month associate clinically relevant reduction rate fall ( 31 % ) .The secondary research question address process outcome inform large trial evaluate effectiveness intervention physical activity level , physical performance , quality life .</detailed_description>
