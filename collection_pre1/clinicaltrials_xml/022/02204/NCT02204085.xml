GO-203-2c target cancer cell , leave healthy cell unaffected.This Phase I/II clinical trial . A Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Trial MUC1 Inhibitor , GO-203-2C Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Phase I - The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) determine phase I section trial . - Patients fulfill eligibility criterion enter trial GO-203-2c . - After screen procedure confirm participation research study . The investigator look high dose combination study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) everyone participate research study receive dose study drug . The dose give depend number participant enrol study prior well dose tolerate . - A subsequent dose escalation evaluate combination GO-203-2c decitabine . - Phase II - The primary goal determine combination two drug result clinical response</detailed_description>
