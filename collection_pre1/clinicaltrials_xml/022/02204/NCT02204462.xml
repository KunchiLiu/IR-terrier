	<brief_summary>Our preclinical study suggest capacity positron emission tomography image agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium ( FBnTP ) detect early-stage small breast tumor ( e.g. , DCIS ) , differentiate benign malignant mass well accuracy obtain exist breast imaging tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer widespread type cancer among woman USA , second lead cause death . The National Cancer Institute estimate 2013 , USA , 226,870 woman diagnose breast cancer 39,510 woman die breast cancer , progressive metastatic disease . Early detection treatment disease , tumor still localize high curability state , outmost important determinant disease-free survival breast cancer patient . Survival rate woman first diagnosed pure early-stage noninvasive tumor ( ductal carcinoma situ- DCIS ) nearly 98 % , drop 48 % patient advanced disease.Yet , early detection breast cancer relatively poor . This best exemplify astonish percentage benign biopsy ; 80 % 1.7 million biopsy USA , cost $ 3 billion ; whereas , small fraction ( ~20 % ) newly diagnose woman find pure DCIS . Our preclinical study suggest capacity positron emission tomography ( PET ) image agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium ( FBnTP ) detect early-stage small breast tumor ( e.g. , DCIS ) , differentiate benign malignant mass well accuracy obtain exist breast imaging tool . Accordingly , present protocol design extend preclinical finding clinical study breast cancer woman , assess effectiveness 18F-FBnTP detecting breast malignant lesion , comparison magnetic resonance image fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging .</detailed_description>
