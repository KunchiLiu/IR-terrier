	<brief_summary>Trans-Radial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( TR-PCI ) rapidly become gold standard . This especially case primary Percutaneous Coronary Interventions ( PCI ) , benefit radial approach , reduce major bleeding mortality , expect . However limited research available look consequence trans-radial access upper extremity function . The main objective study provide insight morbidity regard upper extremity surround radial access route percutaneous coronary intervention . Secondary objective provide insight consequence functional status , factor influence financial cost morbidity , identify subject might benefit early referral treatment morbidity generate hypotheses clinical research matter . The investigator hypothesis approximately 20 % population experience upper extremity dysfunction TR-PCI .</brief_summary>
