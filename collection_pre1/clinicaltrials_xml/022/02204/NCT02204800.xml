	<brief_summary>Active surveillance kidney cancer involve closely observing tumor periodic image study rather immediately proceed invasive treatment . This mean tumor ignore future treatment necessary , rather mean tumor require treatment time . On active surveillance , tumor closely monitor without treatment , however tumor change reach predefined threshold physician longer considers safe , physician strongly encourage treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While patient small kidney tumor may require eventual treatment , . Therefore , American Urologic Association considers active surveillance acceptable treatment strategy . This protocol prospective study active surveillance small clear cell kidney tumor ( common type kidney tumor ) design identify predictive marker may help identify patient unlikely require surgical treatment . Predictive marker measurable characteristic may predict future behavior tumor . There currently available predictive marker help identify tumor destine require treatment . Such marker may useful increase use active surveillance inform patient small renal tumor immediate treatment may consider overtreatment .</detailed_description>
