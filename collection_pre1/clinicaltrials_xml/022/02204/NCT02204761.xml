	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study proton beam radiation therapy treat patient thoracic cancer come back receive prior radiation therapy . Proton beam radiation therapy use high energy proton kill tumor cell may cause less damage normal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Thoracic Cancer Who Have Received Prior Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess grade 3 toxicity associate thoracic re-irradiation proton therapy , prospectively apply normal organ radiation dose limit . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy thoracic re-irradiation proton therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy per standard care . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
