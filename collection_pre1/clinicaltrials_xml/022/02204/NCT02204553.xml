	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open label , expand treatment protocol panobinostat , bortezomib dexamethasone patient relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma . Panobinostat administer start dose 20mg orally three time week ( every day ) two week one week , dose adjustment permit base observed toxicity . Bortezomib administer either intravenously sub-cutaneously , twice week day 1 4 , two week 1 week . After 8 cycle treatment , patient achieve stable disease well modify EBMT 1998 criterion may continue combination therapy bortezomib dose change day 1 8 21 day cycle 48 week therapy . At end treatment period , ( 48 week ) patient stable disease good may continue therapy discretion investigator September 2015 drug commercially available , whichever come first . Patients achieve least stable disease 8 cycle must discontinue study treatment . Dexamethasone administered day day immediately follow bortezomib treatment . Patients receive study treatment third week cycle . Cycles define 21 day treatment . Investigators may add anti-myeloma agent ( exception bisphosphonates ) patient remain study treatment .
