	<brief_title>Whipple Procedure : Standard Care vs. Thunderbeat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As pancreas feed many vessel , necessary use lot ligature , clip suture hemostasis dissection . This dissection technique time consume require numerous change instrument . The device investigator currently available use operate suite EnSeal LigaSure . A new type surgical scissors delivers ultrasonically generate frictional heat energy electrically generate bipolar energy simultaneously , know Thunderbeat™ ( Olympus , Japan ) , available alternative dissection hemostasis . Thunderbeat™ provide FDA clearance March 2012 use open , laparoscopic , endoscopic surgery , procedure cutting , vessel ligation ( seal cut ) , coagulation , grasp dissection perform . The Thunderbeat™ device provide first integration bipolar ultrasonic energy deliver simultaneously single multi-functional instrument . This integration provide surgeon ability rapidly cut tissue ultrasonic energy create reliable vessel seal bipolar energy without change device . The current provide special generator contains high capacity low voltage . The body 's protein , collagen elastin , convert permanently seal zone result . As tissue branch seal , lateral thermic tissue damage limit minimum . Several author describe tendency reduce intraoperative blood loss bipolar energy device . Other trial show reduce operating time bipolar device utilize several surgical procedure , thyroid , hepatic , urologic , hemorrhoidectomy gynecology surgery . Correct dissection operate field important avert secondary bleeding complication , might cause re-operation elevate patient ' morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
