	<brief_title>PET Assessment Acute Lung Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG-PET ) potential way measure lung inflammation . FDG-PET image clinically accept FDA-approved method commonly use diagnosis management cancer . PET machine detect radiation generates picture use donut shape scanner similar appearance x-ray `` CAT '' compute tomography ( CT ) scan . FDG stand [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose , radiolabeled sugar use identify area inflammation PET scanner . A CT scan take picture lung airways look like . T cell primary cause acute rejection lung transplant . Because T cell must divide order activate cause rejection , image divide another way determine whether acute rejection occur . A new PET tracer call [ 18F ] ISO-1 bind divide cell . Therefore , [ 18F ] ISO-1 may help u measure acute rejection accurately . [ 18F ] ISO-1 investigational drug .</detailed_description>
