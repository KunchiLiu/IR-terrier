	<detailed_description>The aim study ( mention Brief Summary ) address use 6-month multi-wave assessment approximately 200 college student . Participants randomly assign one three approach determine meet study criterion . Random assignment occur participant schedule first session . All participant partake three group session . The first session take approximately 2 hour complete . The second third session schedule 2 6 month first session take approximately 45 minute complete . In initial session first approach , group session include discussion constitutes regular physical activity benefit exercise basic tip activity . Guidelines prescribe suggest exercise base recommendation U.S. Department Health Human Services well risks associate exercise reduce . In initial session second approach , group session include discussion component first approach , emphasis create implementation intention . Discussions revolve around possible barrier exercise plan overcome barrier make specific plan exercise , along designate type exercise perform long ( many repetition ) . In initial session third approach , group session include discussion component second approach well include finding industriousness . Participants direct think generate solution become industrious despite difficulty may face relate solution help engage exercise behavior . For approach , participant complete questionnaire regard aspect personality , attitude regard exercise , beliefs positive negative effect exercise , confidence engage exercise despite barrier , current level exercise . Participants ' body mass index also measure . All participant give exercise booklet tailor respective approach record exercise behavior three week follow initial session . They also loan pedometer use track overall daily activity three-week period . Participants third approach also receive booster contact ( encourage think effort monitor physical activity ) every two week start three-week tracking period six-month follow ( total 11 booster contact ) . The first session video audio record check ensure presentation consistency . At end first session , participant give post-session survey gauge well material present determine much information participant felt gained session . When participant return daily exercise diary pedometer , also complete condense set measure ( similar first session ) track change experience three-week tracking period . For 2- 6-month follow-up session , participant approach complete questionnaire initial session body mass index measure . Power analyse conduct via G*Power , 3.1.6 indicate 159 participant need detect effect size F 0.25 alpha error probability 0.05 power 1-Î’ =.80 . Oversampling 25 % occur account possible attrition study , thereby make target N = 200 .</detailed_description>
