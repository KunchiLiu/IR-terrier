	<brief_summary>Objective Evaluating safety efficacy iloprost eptifibatide co-administration compare placebo addition standard care septic shock patient . Trial rationale Iloprost eptifibatide combination therapy septic shock patient expect deactivate endothelium restore vascular integrity , reduce formation microvascular thrombosis dissolve exist clot microcirculation maintain platelet count , thereby improve platelet-mediated immune function reduce risk bleeding . Together expect translate reduce organ failure improve outcome patient septic shock . Trial population The trial population patient &gt; 18 year admit ICU septic shock within last 24h . Eighteen evaluable septic shock patient include . Trial design This single center , randomize ( 2:1 , active : placebo ) , placebo control , double-blind investigator-initiated phase IIa trial patient septic shock , investigate safety efficacy co-administration Iloprost Eptifibatide 48h continuous i.v infusion totally 18 patient . All patient receive standard ICU care include LMWH thrombosis prophylaxis . As patient present trial site acute , critical condition , scientific guardian co-sign informed consent form inclusion . Next-of-kin patient ' general practitioner co-sign soon possible patient provide inform consent whenever possible . The active treatment expect improve clinical condition individual patient provide information may translate improved therapy future sepsis patient . During study , blood sample take different time point . Patients observe assessed continuously regard complication include bleeding . Patients actively assess long patient ICU . During extended follow period day 30 90 , contact make patient follow safety event vital status . The trial conduct accordance protocol current regulatory requirement legislation Denmark . Investigational product The active treatment trial comprise co-administration 1 ng/kg/min Ilomedin® 0.5 µg/kg/min Integrilin® 48h continuous i.v infusion . The drug purchase administer accord product specification . Placebo The placebo trial 0.9 % saline 48h continuous i.v infusion , use placebo study drug . The i.v volume placebo saline administer equal administered volume dilute ( 0.9 % saline ) active drug . Data protection In compliance Danish data protection law , trial approve Danish Data Protection Agency . Sponsor study financial support This research project investigator-initiated trial sponsor co-investigator Sisse R. Ostrowski co-investigator Pär I. Johansson collaboration principal investigator Morten Bestle . It receive fund commercial sponsor . Time line Patient recruitment period run September 2014 August 2015 . Follow-up data 30-day 90-day outcome adverse event collect . Initial data analysis do completion 30-day follow-up patient . Secondary data analysis do completion 90-day follow-up patient .</brief_summary>
