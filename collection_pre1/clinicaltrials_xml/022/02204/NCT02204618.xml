	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Single Sided Deafness Asymmetrical Hearing Loss : Cost/Utility Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single side deafness profound asymmetrical hearing loss impairment significantly alter quality life . Behavioural problem scholar delay report child . Speech recognition background compete noise sound localization impair . 1/1000 new born affect incidence tends rise adult population . At moment , guideline regard treatment single side deafness asymmetrical hearing loss . Some patient n't even receive therapeutic proposition . Three treatment option available : - CROS ( Contralateral Routing Of Signal ) system convey auditory information deaf ear good ear use wi-fi - bone conduction device use transcranial conduction convey auditory information poor ear good ear - cochlear implant directly stimulate afferent fiber auditory nerve poor ear Cochlear implantation therefore treatment restore stimulation poor ear . Its efficacy single side deafness associate incapacitate tinnitus demonstrate Pr Van de Heyning ( Leeuven , Be ) colleague . Its interest compare CROS system bone conduction device valuable study conduct S. Arndt ( Pr Laszig , Freibourg , Ger ) . Cochlear implant provide well speech noise recognition score dichotic hearing , i.e speech noise source spatially separate . Their first publication involve 11 patient date , 110 patient single side deafness include protocol . The efficacy cochlear implantation thus validate treatment single side deafness asymmetrical hearing loss . The investigator assume cochlear implant indication effective also cost-effective . The investigator ' experimental protocol relies real life therapeutic strategy , cochlear implant may propose CROS bone conduction system fail . Thus , subject enrol study try CROS bone conduction device . If trial ineffective , remain subject randomize two arm ( cochlear implantation v 6 month abstention follow cochlear implantation ) . A comparative cost-utility analysis two arm , medical consequence measure term quality life identify preference strategy . Specific binaural hearing measurement respect treatment option ( abstention , CROS , bone conduction device , cochlear implant ) also collect .</detailed_description>
