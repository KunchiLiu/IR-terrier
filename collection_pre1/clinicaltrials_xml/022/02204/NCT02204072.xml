	<brief_summary>The overall aim trial investigate safety anti-tumour activity experimental drug BI 836845 take together prostate cancer drug , enzalutamide , compare enzalutamide give alone , castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient previously treat fail docetaxel abiraterone treatment . Initially , tolerability safety phase ( phase Ib escalation ) perform confirm maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend dos BI 836845 enzalutamide take together . Once MTD , recommend phase II dose , determined expansion cohort also explore ( phase Ib expansion ) CRPC patient already take enzalutamide rise prostate serum antigen ( PSA ) level . Patients may receive prior docetaxel abiraterone . Patients cohort receive MTD , recommend phase II dose , BI 836845 enzalutamide determine phase Ib escalation phase . The randomised trial ( phase II ) open label , parallel group study design 1:1 ratio patient receive either BI 836845 plus enzalutamide ( Arm A ) MTD/recommended dose , enzalutamide alone ( Arm B ) . In part trial safety , anti-tumour activity assess , addition circulate tumour cell ( CTC ) , prostate serum antigen ( PSA ) response progression , determination Overall Survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
