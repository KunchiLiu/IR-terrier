	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find safety inject gene ( DNA ) mammaglobin-A people breast cancer . The DNA use study purify bacteria contains gene mammaglobin-A . Mammaglobin-A protein highly express breast cancer cell . Injection mammaglobin-A DNA may way generate immune response breast cancer cell . There evidence immune response may way fight cancer . In addition evaluate safety mammaglobin-A injection , study also look immune response participant 's body injection .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A patient eligible inclusion study ALL follow criterion apply : Newly diagnose histologically confirm invasive breast cancer . Clinical T2T4c , N , M0 invasive ER+ ( Allred Score 68 ) HER2 ( 0 1+ IHC FISH negative amplification ) breast cancer AJCC 7th edition clinical staging , goal surgery completely excise tumor breast lymph node . Patients T1c tumor eligible consider candidate neoadjuvant endocrine therapy . At least 1 measurable lesion . Candidate neoadjuvant endocrine therapy . At least 18 year age . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 . Adequate organ marrow function 28 day prior start neoadjuvant endocrine therapy define : WBC ≥3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL platelets ≥100,000/μL total bilirubin ≤institutional upper limit normal AST/ALT ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine IULN Postmenopausal premenopausal . NOTE : Postmenopausal woman , verify : ( 1 ) bilateral surgical oophorectomy , ( 2 ) spontaneous menses ≥ 1 year ( 3 ) menses &lt; 1 year FSH estradiol level postmenopausal range , accord institutional standard . Premenopausal woman , verify : ( 1 ) regular menses , ( 2 ) FSH estradiol level premenopausal range , accord institutional standard . Able understand , willing sign write informed consent document . Confirmation primary tumor express mammaglobinA IHC . Tumor Ki67 value ≤ 10 % 14 day endocrine therapy . A patient ineligible inclusion study ANY follow criterion apply : Received follow treatment cancer ( except neoadjuvant endocrine therapy specify within protocol ) : Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Biotherapy Hormonal therapy Investigational agent Receiving investigational agent ( ) receive investigational agent within last 30 day . Known metastatic disease . Known allergy , history serious adverse reaction vaccine anaphylaxis , hive , respiratory difficulty . Prior axillary lymph node sampling ( sentinel lymph node biopsy axillary lymph node dissection ) . FNA axillary lymph node acceptable . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Prior currently active autoimmune disease require management immunosuppression . This include inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatologic disease medical condition use medication ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) might make difficult patient complete full course treatment generate immune response vaccine . Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require daily systemic corticosteroid acceptable . Any patient receive steroid discuss PI determine eligible . Pregnant breastfeeding . A negative serum pregnancy test require 7 day study entry , patient must willing employ adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must use two form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Known HIVpositive status . These patient ineligible potential inability generate immune response vaccine . Subjects strong likelihood nonadherence difficulty adhere followup schedule due geographic distance Siteman Cancer Center knowingly register . Individuals skinfold measurement cutaneous subcutaneous tissue eligible injection site ( leave right medial deltoid region ) exceed 40 mm Individuals ability observe possible local reaction eligible injection site ( deltoid region ) , opinion investigator , unacceptably obscure due physical condition permanent body art Therapeutic traumatic metal implant skin muscle either deltoid region . Acute chronic , clinically significant hematologic , pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality determine investigator base medical history , physical examination , EKG , and/or laboratory screen test Any chronic active neurologic disorder , include seizure epilepsy , exclude single febrile seizure child Syncopal episode within 12 month screen Current use electronic stimulation device , cardiac demand pacemaker , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator , nerve stimulators , deep brain stimulators .</criteria>
