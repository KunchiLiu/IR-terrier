	<brief_summary>Background : Regular exercise cornerstone prevention management comorbidities . Unfortunately , metabolic benefit exercise training universal varies among individual . A main factor likely explain exercise training variability lack empirical evidence determinant exercise training . A series muscle-derived cytokine recently discover ( 1 ) release exercise ( 2 ) exert positive effect peripheral tissue . Irisin one novel `` myokines '' might contribute metabolic adaptation exercise training . Methods : The investigator perform pilot cohort study obese adolescent perform resistance exercise train 6 week . The main exposure variable acute release irisin resistance exercise . The main outcome measure change hepatic triglyceride content glucose area curve 75g , 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test . Study Hypothesis : The primary overall hypothesis change plasma Irisin single bout exercise associate metabolic adaptation 6 week resistance training , specifically , reduction hepatic triglyceride content post-prandial glucose excursion , obese adolescent .</brief_summary>
