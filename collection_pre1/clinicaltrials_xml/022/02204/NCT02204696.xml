	<brief_title>Tonsillectomy Adults With Tonsillar Hypertrophy Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine tonsillectomy eliminate symptom obstructive sleep apnea patient obstructive sleep apnea mark tonsillar hypertrophy normal soft palate uvula length . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine tonsillectomy eliminates obstructive sleep apnea determine polysomnography . 2 . To determine tonsillectomy eliminates excessive daytime sleepiness obstructive sleep apnea symptom . Rationale : Current surgical procedure obstructive sleep apnea include tonsillectomy soft palate surgery ( include uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ) . Tonsillectomy alone may provide sufficient benefit adult mark tonsillar hypertrophy normal soft palate uvula length , avoid need additional soft palate surgery . Intervention : Tonsillectomy perform standard care , patient would undergo say surgery regardless study . Study intervention include multiple home sleep study determine effect tonsillectomy impact symptom sleep apnea . Study Population : Inclusion criterion : Subjects must least 18 year old , document obstructive sleep apnea ; willing undergo 3 home sleep study ; markedly hypertrophic ( 3+ 4+ ) tonsil . Exclusion criterion : Subjects must craniofacial abnormality ; normal soft palate length ( &lt; 4 cm ) uvula length ( ( &lt; 2 cm ) ; must history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , untreated psychological disorder , restless leg syndrome , alcohol drug abuse ; must body mass index &lt; 35 ; must plan use continuous positive airway pressure study period , lack significant nasal obstruction . The subject serve control . Methods Follow Up : This two-center prospective study include evaluation demographic , clinical symptom , extent tonsillar hypertrophy , sleep habit , home sleep study . All subject undergo 4-8 week period watchful waiting ( standard minimum delay schedule surgery ) , follow tonsillectomy alone , value baseline compare period watchful wait post-tonsillectomy . Outcomes : Primary outcome apnea-hypopnea index ( home sleep study ) . Exploratory outcome include sleep study result subjective assessment ( sleep-related quality life Functional Outcome Sleep Questionnaire daytime sleepiness Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) . Statistics Plans Analysis : The minimum sample size 44 subject , enrollment target 60 subject accommodate 25 % dropout rate . Standard statistical test ( e.g. , pair t-tests continuous measure ) evaluate potential difference outcome measure baseline vs. post-watchful wait baseline vs. post-tonsillectomy . Similarly , standard appropriate statistical test ( e.g , t-tests continuous measure ) compare change watchful wait vs. tonsillectomy ( e.g. , baseline vs. post-watchful baseline vs. post-tonsillectomy ) .</detailed_description>
