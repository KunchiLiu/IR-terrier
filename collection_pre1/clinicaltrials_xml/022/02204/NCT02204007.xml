	<brief_summary>This observer-blinded prospective randomize clinical trial define efficacy new technology develop Cleveland Clinic improve position acetabular shell total hip arthroplasty.The propose study enroll patient consent total hip arthroplasty without screw fixation treatment hip pathology . This treatment standard care . Patients receive standard care pre- post-operative care placement standard care implant commercially available FDA approve general use clinical indication use patient . The difference treatment group use surrogate bone model help assist surgeon visualize ideal placement acetabular component . Diagnostic testing perform specifically relate study consist obtain one pre-operative one post-operative CT scan . The post-operative scan perform within two week surgery . The investigator predict patient 3D image bone model well acetabular shell placement standard preoperative planning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan enroll 44 subject ( 22 standard surgery group 22 experimental surgical group ) randomize clinical trial . All subject standard care indication THA give inform consent surgery participation study . Enrollment occur part routine office evaluation obtain treat surgeon research assistant . Four surgeon ( Wael Barsoum , Trevor Murray , Carlos Higuera , Michael Bloomfield ) surgical experience total hip arthroplasty perform procedure study . All subject within surgeon 's practice qualify participation study approach . Subjects enrol least 10 day prior date surgery . Ten day minimum time necessary obtain pre-operative CT scan surgical planning manufacture surrogate bone model . Patients approach regular office visit contact phone interested , schedule arrive radiology department sign inform consent receive preoperative CT scan . Subjects randomize either experimental control group time consent study coordinator . Subjects experimental group pre-operative planning do use 3D surgical simulator surrogate bone model available surgeon surgery . Subjects control group pre-operative planning do use plain film x-ray two-dimensional ( 2D ) template . Eligible subject inclusion study able receive pelvic CT scan Cleveland Clinic . Additionally , obtain standard care pre- post-operative x-ray ( AP view ) . For subject randomize experimental group , CT scan DICOM image upload Cleveland Clinic develop surgical simulator specifically design THA least 10 day prior surgery . For experimental subject , Cleveland Clinic pre-operative planning software use define optimal size location acetabular component ( acetabular shell , ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bear - UHMWPE ) . The treat surgeon virtually place implant simulator software . The specification shell placement vary depend subject 's individual pathology pelvic morphology , expect fall within range 10-35 degree anteversion 30-50 degree abduction . In control group , surgeon use standard method pre-operative plan use pre-operative x-ray . To prepare acetabulum place implant day surgery , surgeon use standard surgical alignment instrument provide manufacturer implant . For experimental group , surgeon use CT scan 3D preoperative planning software place implant virtually . The surgeon provide surrogate bone model fabricate acetabular implant place orientation plan surgical simulator software , use standard surgical instrument provide manufacturer implant . The image obtain post-operative CT scan upload simulator software 3D reconstruction . The 3D image post-operative pelvis implant superimpose onto image pre-operative pelvis virtually place implant . Using measurement tool within software compare position actual acetabular component place patient desire position specify plan . The measurement make angular orientation 3D space ( anteversion inclination ) . Measurements accurate within fraction degree .</detailed_description>
