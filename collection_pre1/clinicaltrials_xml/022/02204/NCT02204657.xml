	<brief_title>The Effect Continuous Glucose Monitoring Glycemic Control Insulin-requiring Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine professional CGM improve glycemic control less hypoglycaemia insulin- require GDM 2 . To determine professional CGM use alters management insulin-requiring GDM 3 . To determine professional CGM improve pregnancy outcomes insulin-requiring GDM . 4 . To determine patient attitude toward CGMS . 2 . HYPOTHESES 1 . Professional CGMS improve glycaemic control woman insulin-requiring GDM less hypoglycaemia 2 . Professional CGM use alter management insulin-requiring GDM 3 . Professional CGMS reduce perinatal morbidity mortality patient insulin- require GDM 4 . Third trimester CGMS parameter correlate good perinatal outcome compare conventional measure glycaemic control pregnancy i.e . fructosamine/ A1c/ FBS/ 2hrs PP glucose STUDY DESIGN - This prospective , open-label , randomize control trial . We plan recruit 80 woman gestational diabetes 28 week gestation less UMMC antenatal clinic . These woman insulin-na√Øve require insulin therapy . 40 subject ( Group 1 ) select undergo professional CGM week 28 , 32 , week 36 another 40 subject individually match regard , age , baseline A1c , BMI recruit undergo usual antenatal care without CGMS ( Group 2 ) . The CGMS data upload reviewed week 29 , 33 , 37 change make therapeutic regimen require endocrinologist . All mother require measure glucose level 7 standardized point day daily . These glucose reading record diary together food log . All subject also require keep hypoglycaemia diary . - The primary outcome glycaemic control third trim maternal hypoglycaemia . We also plan assess change management make endocrinologist base additional information glycemic control obtain professional CGM use . We also plan compare hypoglycaemia hyperglycaemia detection rate use CGMS fingerstick method glucose evaluation . Patient satisfaction group also assess . Written inform consent obtain accordance principle Helsinki Declaration</detailed_description>
