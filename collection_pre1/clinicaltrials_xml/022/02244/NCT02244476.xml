A successful reduction fat sugar drink still proven great challenge since consumer less preference mouth feel reformulate beverage regular beverage . Mainly instrumental measure like rheology traditional tribology entirely predict experienced mouth feel , interest alternative correlate mouth feel aspect relate fat sugar perception . In recent study demonstrate vibration produce interaction tongue , palate beverage consumption sensitive amount fat texturizers beverage . The present study aim clarify relation large panel human subject , systematically evaluate vibration spectra consumption dairy beverage differ fat content , sugar content pH . Secondly , correlation vibration spectrum ( acoustic tribology ) mouth feel-related sensory property composition fat deposit tongue assess .</brief_summary>
