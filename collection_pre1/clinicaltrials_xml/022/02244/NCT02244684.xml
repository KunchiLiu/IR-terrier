	<brief_summary>An overwhelming body evidence protective effect folic acid supplementation neural tube defect affect pregnancy lead mandatory folic acid fortification Canada 1998 . Folate important co-factor transfer one-carbon unit essential DNA synthesis , repair , methylation reaction , aberration implicate pathogenesis several chronic disease include cancer . Epigenetic reprogramming occur utero potential modulate methyl donor supply folate contributor . Animal study show maternal folate exposure modulate epigenetic change offspring , however , limited evidence relationship human . The aim research determine effect maternal dietary folate supplemental folic acid intake periconceptional utero period global gene-specific DNA methylation human infant . This prospective observational study involve 368 Canadian mother-child pair recruit St. Michael 's Hospital Toronto , Ontario . Dietary demographical information collect consent pregnant woman study baseline ( 12-16 week gestation ) third trimester ( 34-37 week gestation ) . Maternal blood sample obtain baseline prior delivery sample umbilical cord blood collect parturition measure level folate status . Global gene-specific DNA methylation umbilical cord blood correlate cord maternal folate status . The data analyze use separate ordinary least square ( OLS ) regression . Results study contribute well understanding maternal folate folic acid intake modulate epigenetic modification offspring potentially effect disease susceptibility later life .</brief_summary>
