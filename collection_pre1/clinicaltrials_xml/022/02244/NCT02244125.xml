	<brief_summary>Imnovid combination dexamethasone indicate treatment adult patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma receive least two prior treatment regimen , include lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) bortezomib ( Velcade ) , demonstrate disease progression last therapy . Patients relapse refractory multiple myeloma receive bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone combination , consider multiple myeloma optimal treatment , access pomalidomide market authorization third line treatment . In France combination authorize marketing first line treatment patient randomize IFM/DFCI 2009 trial receive . This study concern patient previously randomize IFM/DFCI 2009 trial receive bortezomib , lenalidomide Dexamethasone combination first line , progression/relapse time therapeutic opportunity remain limited access pomalidomide market authorization . This study multicentre , phase 2 , open label , study test triple combination pomalidomide cyclophosphamide dexamethasone ( PCD ) multiple myeloma patient refractory first progression/relapse first line treatment bortezomib lenalidomide , IMiDs ( Immuno Modulatory Drug proteasome inhibitor ) accord IFM/DFCI 2009 trial . In IFM/DFCI trial , patient arm A received eight cycle Velcade-Revlimid-Dexamethasone combination follow 1 year lenalidomide maintenance , patient arm B receive 3 cycle Velcade-Revlimid-Dexamethasone combination plus melphalan 200mg/m2 autologous transplantation follow 2 cycle Velcade-Revlimid-Dexamethasone combination consolidation 1 year lenalidomide maintenance . This study contain 3 treatment phase : - Study treatment phase : All patient receive 4 cycle ( 28 day ) pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone combination . - Consolidation phase ( depend initial randomization IFM/DFCI 2009 trial ) : - For patient previously randomize IFM/DFCI 2009 's arm A : - Melphalan 200 mg/m2 follow Autologous Transplantation - Three month , 2 cycle pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone combination - For patient previously randomize IFM/DFCI 2009 's arm B : - 5 cycle pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone combination - Maintenance phase ( identical patient ) subsequent cycle pomalidomide Dexamethasone progression / relapse discontinuation reason . For arm B patient , case relapse occur least 12 month end maintenance IFM/DFCI 2009 trial , could proceed second autologous transplantation therefore follow arm A procedure . The decision proceed second transplant make physician patient . In order amount patient enrol trial initial Arm A Arm B IFM/DFCI 2009 trial , 50 patient include either arm A B , subsequent patient eligible initially treat first 50 patient either arm . The primary endpoint response rate ( Partial Response ( PR ) good ) 4 cycle triple combination pomalidomide cyclophosphamide dexamethasone ( PCD ) study population use International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) response criterion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must treat first line within IFM/DFCI 2009 trial treat within PCD trial second line 2 . Must able understand voluntarily sign informed consent form 3 . Must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement 4 . Age : 1870 year 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month 6 . Patients must progressive ( +/ symptomatic ) Myeloma define IMWG criterion increase ≥25 % low response value one following : Serum Mcomponent and/or ( absolute increase must ≥0.5 g/dl ) Urine Mcomponent and/or ( absolute increase must ≥200 mg/24h ) Only patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein level : difference involve uninvolved FLC level . The absolute increase must &gt; 10 mg/dl Bone marrow plasma cell percentage ; absolute percentage must ≥10 % Definite development new bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma definite increase size exist bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma Development hypercalcaemia ( correct serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dl 2.65mmol/l ) attribute solely plasma cell proliferative disorder . 7 . Patients must clearly detectable quantifiable monoclonal Mcomponent value : IgG ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 10g/l ) IgA ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 5g/l ) IgD ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 0.5g/l ) Light chain ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 1g/l Bence Jones &gt; 200mg/24h ) In patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein level absence renal failure : absolute serum FreeLightChain ( sFLC ) ≥100mg/l abnormal sFLC K/λ ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) find . 8 .
