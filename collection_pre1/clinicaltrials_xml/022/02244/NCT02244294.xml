	<criteria>Phase I Adult men , 45 year age old , diagnose acute urinary retention due BPH Patients never take alphablockers discontinue take alphablockers 72 hour prior entrance study Patients treat indwell urethral catheter treatment acute urinary retention ( AUR ) due BPH Patients must judge investigator reliable willing comply test examination stipulate protocol All patient must willing give meaningful , write , informed consent prior participation trial , accordance regulatory requirement . Patients must also sufficient understand communicate effectively investigator Phase II Patients void spontaneously , least 100 mL postvoid residual volume ≤ 300 mL , Visit 2 Phase I Patients diagnose symptomatic/active urinary tract infection ( UTI ) abnormal urine culture baseline 2 UTIs within last six month . An abnormal urine culture define : A bacterial colony count great equal 100,000 CFU/mL A bacterial colony count great equal 100 CFU/mL know urinary pathogen symptomatic patient Patients distend bladder volume great 1.5 liter ( 1500 ml ) retention measure initial catheter urine volume Patients history sexually transmit disease within last two year Patients active genital herpes disease whose urinary function impact due disease Patients history mechanical outlet obstruction exclude BPH ( i.e. , bladder neck contracture stricture , bladder tumor , bladder calculus ) Patients urethral stricture disease Patients history bladder , prostate , urethral surgery last three month Patients present AUR see within 5 day urethral catheter placement Patients present follow : active urinary stone disease , previous pelvic radiotherapy , perirectal inflammatory disorder inflammatory bowel disease Participation another drug study within 30 day Visit 1 Clinically relevant condition may interfere patient 's ability participate study include , limited , follow : neurologic , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , psychiatric , hematologic respiratory disease clinically relevant laboratory abnormality mention ( e.g. , hematuria ) base upon clinical judgment investigator Patients receive cimetidine , ranitidine warfarin within two week study start date would potentially use medication course trial Patients currently treat finasteride ( PROSCAR® ) would discontinue use upon entrance study Patients know hypersensitivity FLOMAX® ( tamsulosin hydrochloride ) alphablockers Patients history myocardial infarction within six month baseline Patients uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 160 mmHg , diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ) patient severe hypotension ( systolic &lt; 90 mmHg ) Patients use follow drug , 72 hour prior study start date , unable discontinue drug course study : Alphaadrenergic medication Drugs systemic anticholinergic activity include antihistamine .
