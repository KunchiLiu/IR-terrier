	<brief_summary>Background : Postoperative hypothermia may result relevant complication adverse cardiovascular event , wound infection , coagulopathy consecutive blood loss . Patients open cardiac surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass particular risk hypothermia . The study Karalapillai coworkers , analyze huge database incl . 43,158 patient CPB , reveal 66 % experience postoperative hypothermia first 24 hour 0.3 % long . During cardiac surgery great part body surface include wound surface expose . Many patient receive large amount infusion transfusion , undergo hemodilution CPB , may additionally contribute development hypothermia . Objective plan study find incidence duration postoperative hypothermia also risk factor hypothermia cardiac patient . Further objective incidence postoperative complication relation postoperative core temperature . Methods : A retrospective chart review 780 patient underwent cardiac surgery CPB Included patient ≥ 18 year old . Excluded patient preoperative hyperthermia ( &gt; 37.8 °C ) hypothermia ( &gt; 36 °C ) . The following parameter record : temperature measure ICU arrive 6 hour primary outcome , biometric data include age , sex , body weight , height , ASA physical status , surgical procedure include emergency case , anesthetic surgical ( bypass- ) time , infusion/transfusion-regimen , blood loss urine output , cool temperature bypass , method temperature protection , outcome operation . All data describe number percent Pearson chi-square method use analyze correlation hypothermia risk factor . P-value &lt; 0.05 define significant .</brief_summary>
