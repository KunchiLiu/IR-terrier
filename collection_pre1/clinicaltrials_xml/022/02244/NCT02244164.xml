	<brief_title>Pathophysiological Study Increase Pancreatic Volume Type 2 Diabetes Treatments .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incretinomimetics inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) new treatment diabetes . The incretinomimetics analogs Glucagon Like Peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , secrete endocrine L-cells colon terminal ileum peptide . Serum GLP-1 increase rapidly meal . But degradation also fast . It act hypothalamus reduce appetite food intake , stomach delay gastric empty level beta islet cell induce synthesis secretion insulin ( 1 ) . The incretinomimetics currently market Belgium ( March 2014 ) exenatide ( Byetta ® ) , liraglutide ( Victoza ® ) , lixisenatide ( Lyxumia ® ) soon ( April 2014 ) extended-release exenatide ( Bydureon ® ) . The DPP-4 prevent degradation GLP-1 . The DPP-4 currently market ( March 2014 ) sitagliptin ( Januvia ® ) , vildagliptin ( Galvus ® ) , saxagliptin ( Onglyza ® ) ( Trajenta ® ) linagliptin . In diabetic patient , treatment allow significant reduction fast plasma glucose postprandial , low risk hypoglycemia weight gain ( sometimes weight loss ) ( 2 ) . Their place management type 2 diabetes consider combination metformin , diabetes inadequately control despite maximal dose latter , patient intolerant metformin . A study evaluate safety 'incretinomimetics therapy `` showed increase pancreatic weight 40 % ( 3 ) . Indeed , cohort 34 pancreatic organ donor brain death , 20 patient diabetic 8 incretin mimetics 1 year . An increase pancreatic mass average 40 % observe compare diabetic patient without treatment . This study also demonstrate increase mass beta cell without restore insulin function . The advanced mass increase without significant increase cell size hypothesis decrease apoptosis beta cell . Furthermore also increase mass cell produce α intraductulaire cell proliferation . This would responsible onset pancreatitis also appearance endocrine microadenomas . The study ( 3 ) also observe increase cell proliferation exocrine compartment pancreas ( ductal acinar cell ) induce incretinomimetic increased frequency lesion potentially pre-cancerous PanIN 1 2 treatment . Another study ( 4 ) group researcher show GLP-1 induce ductal cell growth rat treat high-dose exenatide 12 week . It could therefore , ductal obstruction induce pancreatitis . All study therefore warn new treatment potentially inducer different pancreatic lesion . The aim study provide good understanding pathophysiological mechanism increase volume / pancreatic exocrine secretion expose certain treatment type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
