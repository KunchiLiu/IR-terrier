	<brief_summary>AMS ( acute mountain sickness ) affect ascend high ( &gt; 2000m ) fast . Acetazolamide effective drug prevention AMS proper acclimatization gradual ascent may option . AMS present headache non-specific symptom nausea , tiredness , dizziness . Because side effect acetazolamide tingle sensation , drug investigate see prevent AMS . Ibuprofen recently show prevent AMS . In present study investigator want see acetaminophen also prevent AMS acetaminophen unlike ibuprofen gastric side effect . Second , acetaminophen much less anti-inflammatory component ibuprofen , may also provide insight pathophysiology AMS acetaminophen find effective prevention AMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibuprofen v Acetaminophen AMS Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) well-known disorder sojourner high altitude ( &gt; 2000m ) characterize headache , nausea tiredness , akin hangover-like symptom . The Lake Louise criterion AMS primarily develop allow uniformity compare prevalence AMS different high altitude region . Proper acclimatization gradual ascent high altitude best mean prevention AMS . However may instance rapid ascent may necessary . Acetazolamide best know drug prevention AMS . Because well-known side effect like tingle sensation finger toe potential sulpha allergy ( acetazolamide sulpha-based drug ) problem , alternative drug prevention AMS seek . Recently two randomize control trial show usefulness ibuprofen 600 mg tid orally prevention AMS . The exact mechanism cause AMS unknown although evidence point process central nervous system . The mechanism headache , main feature AMS patient , probably multifactorial various chemical mechanical factor activate final common pathway , trigeminovascular system . Triggering factor associate high altitude hypoxia lead AMS may include arachidonic acid metabolite amongst others serotonin , histamine , nitric oxide . The response AMS prevention non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) steroid provide indirect evidence arachidonic acid pathway inflammation genesis AMS . But contrast , role drug acetaminophen primarily provide analgesia blunt meningovascular receptor know mediate nociception unknown prevention AMS . Crucially acetaminophen prevent AMS gastric irritation possible gastrointestinal bleeding well know side effect ibuprofen would encounter . In addition acetaminophen like ibuprofen ( unlike acetazolamide ) easily available counter . Therefore , investigator hypothesize acetaminophen adequate dosage ( 1 g tid ) effective ibuprofen ( 600 mg tid ) prevention AMS . Western trekker randomly administer either acetaminophen ibuprofen double blind fashion 4300m investigator enroll participant . Then , 5000 Lobuje 48 96 hour investigator re-examine Lake Louise Questionnaire ( LLQ ) see AMS status . The investigator also check pulse oximeter . Sample Size : With variable alpha 5 % , power 80 % , control 34 % ( base previous study ) experimental group 18 % , sample size arrive ( use http : //www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-superiority/ ) 115 per arm , total 230 participant . With 20 % drop final number investigator require 288 participant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy subject age 18 65 , male female , nonNepali , without AMS concurrent illness , already take NSAIDs acetazolamide drug prevention altitude illness . Subjects enrol study administrator en route directly Everest Base Camp Kala Patthar villages Pheriche/Dingboche Lobuche . Individuals meet inclusion criterion , include mild AMS ( one mild symptom Lake Louise Questionnaire ) significantly depress oxygen saturation ( &lt; 75 % ) ; female know pregnant , exclude possibility pregnant , miss menses 7 day ; individual spend 24 hour altitude 4500 meters/14,000 foot within last 9 day ; anyone know take follow last 2 day : acetazolamide ( Diamox® ) , steroid ( dexamethasone , prednisone ) , theophylline , diuretic ( Lasix® ) ; individual know intracranial space occupy lesion history elevate intracranial pressure , ( i.e . tumor , hydrocephalus , etc ) .</criteria>
