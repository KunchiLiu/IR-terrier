	<brief_summary>Sitz bath conventional empirical remedy commonly recommend non-operative treatment various anal disease . However , substitute sitz bath , patient accept inconvenience treatment disease . Electronic bidet use convenience automatic device cleanse perineal area , especially defecation . The similarity contact water perineal area , clinical use electronic bidet suggest treatment anal disease . However , report clinical use electronic bidet . Investigators perform study evaluate effect electronic bidet anal resting pressure , compare conventional warm sitz bath normal healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anal Resting Pressure After Bidet , Compared Sitz Bath</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Anorectal Manometry The Subjects underwent digital rectal examination baseline anorectal manometry lateral decubitus position use device Dynacompact ( Menfis Biomedica Corp. , Bologna , Italy ) use 8 channel polyvinyl ( PVC ) catheter measure orifice orient radially . Resting maximal pressure anal canal measure pull catheter anorectum speed 0.5 mm/sec ( 'rapid pull ' technique ) Recordings Anal Resting Pressure Electronic Bidet Sitz Bath The subject underwent clinical experiment recording anal resting pressure change use electronic bidet take sitz bath . For measurement effect electronic bidet anal resting pressure , different manometry catheter ( 8 spirally arranged channel , 0.5 cm apart ) insert anal canal place upper channel ( channels No . 1-2 ) temperature probe rectum low channel ( channel No . 3-8 ) anal canal . The catheter fix buttock area use waterproof tape subject sat toilet equip electronic bidet ( Coway Corp , Seoul , Korea ) . After anal resting pressure stabilize sit position , anal resting pressure high pressure zone ( HPZ ) check control value measure change anal resting pressure . The anal high pressure zone ( HPZ ) define channel represent high pressure within anal canal subject . The pressure sit adjusted gravity . A water flow electronic bidet apply anus 3 minute . We design new water flow system electronic bidet , fountain type low force ( 10mN ) , water fall immediately contact perineal area ( Fig 1A ) . Before apply water flow , mist type water particle spray second gentle contact water first . The water use electronic bidet tap water warm temperature 38 degree celsius . Anal resting pressure channel HPZ check 1 , 2 3 minute use electronic bidet percentage anal resting pressure calculate compare control value check use electronic bidet . Maximum minimum pressure HPZ application electronic bidet note . Sitz bath also undergone another day . After insertion catheter , subject seat chair small tub fill warm water 38 degree celsius sink buttock ( Fig 1B ) . The measurement anal resting pressure similar electronic bidet . Anal resting pressure HPZ check use electronic bidet 3 minute . Maximum minimum pressure also check .</detailed_description>
