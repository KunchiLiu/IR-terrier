	<brief_summary>The coexistence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient term overlap syndrome , affect 1 % U.S. population.The investigator propose conduct study aim : ( 1 ) compare right leave ventricular hemodynamic parameter use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) overlap syndrome vs. COPD OSA ; ( 2 ) compare effect bi-level positive airway pressure ( BPAP ) vs. nocturnal oxygen therapy ( NOT ) right ventricular ( RV ) hemodynamics overlap syndrome . This study allow u test hypothesis : ( 1 ) Patients overlap syndrome RV dysfunction COPD OSA ; ( 2 ) treatment hypoxemia hypercapnia sleep improve RV hemodynamics compare treatment hypoxemia alone patient overlap syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Ventricular Hemodynamics Using Cardiac MRI Patients COPD OSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite high prevalence overlap syndrome , data available pathophysiology clinical consequence patient . Overlap syndrome recently report excess cardiovascular mortality compare COPD alone . However , study evaluate mechanism excess cardiovascular mortality untreated overlap syndrome . In addition , prospective , randomize , control data currently available treatment overlap syndrome . This study divide two part . The first part ( Part 1 ) cross-sectional cohort study compare subject overlap syndrome COPD alone OSA alone . Patients COPD OSA overlap syndrome evaluate overnight sleep study , cardiac MRI , serum inflammatory biomarker , urine catecholamine level , pulmonary function test , questionnaires sleep health relate quality life . These measurement compare overlap syndrome control group either COPD OSA alone . The second part ( Part 2 ) study prospective , parallel-group , randomize , control pilot study examine effect BPAP ( nocturnal oxygen need ) vs. nocturnal oxygen therapy alone patient overlap syndrome ( 20 subject treatment arm ) . The measurement do Part 1 repeat evaluate treatment effect .</detailed_description>
