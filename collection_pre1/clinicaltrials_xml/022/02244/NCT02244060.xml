	<brief_summary>Objective measure health relatively expensive ; meanwhile , self-reports critique subjective comparable . A middle ground approach apply frontier work vignette method . The aim survey experiment explore validity survey instrument identify student need glass , use objectively measure visual acuity gold standard . It hypothesize direct comparison vignette ( DCV ) significantly different indirect comparison vignette ( ICV ) ; meanwhile , self-assessment vision ( SAV ) significantly different prim self-assessment vision ( PSAV ) . It also hypothesize DCV valid survey instrument ICV classify student need glass , use objective visual acuity gold standard . Lastly , hypothesize prim effect vignettes improve validity self-assessment . It plan enroll 3,755 subject survey experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The school visit announce project survey experiment measure visual acuity , participant receive free eye examination . After receive consent/assent , two data collection strategy apply survey - DCV ICV , identify individual perception vision . In arm ICV , self-assessment vision ( SAV ) list vignette question ; however , arm DCV , self-assessed vision ( PSAV ) list vignette question estimate prim effect . With randomization prior administration survey , 50 % student enrol `` direct comparison vignette '' ( DCV ) another 50 % `` implied comparison vignette '' ( ICV ) . Each participant self-administer survey . The objective measure vision set vacant classroom assistance member Health Center Jingning County . DCV , ICV , SAV , PSAV estimate randomized survey questionnaire . Objectively measured vision simplify Snellen chart . Measures - All subject ask respond question vision acuity without glass contact lenses hypothetical scenario . Information collect survey include self-assessed vision , vignette , cluster ( school , grade , class ) , whether subject wear glass contact lens , two demographic variable ( age sex ) . Self-assessed vision - Data self-assessed vision collect ask student think vision without glass contact lens . Specifically , student ask respond question : `` present time , would say distance eyesight excellent , good , fair , poor , poor ? '' Vignettes - The DCV questionnaire ask subject jointly evaluate vision vignette situation ; meanwhile , ICV questionnaire ask subject conduct single evaluation vignette question . Even though subject ICV questionnaires ask compare visual acuity hypothetical person Zhang , experimenter could conduct comparison data analysis . Accordingly approach name `` indirect comparison vignette '' ( ICV ) . For example , DCV questionnaire , subject ask respond follow question : Sitting last row classroom , [ Xiao Zhang ] recognize teacher 's face clearly identify small hand write blackboard clearly . Would say distance eyesight : 1 . Better Zhang 's 2 . The Zhang 's 3 . Worse Zhang 's Comparatively , ICV questionnaire , subject ask respond follow question instead . Sitting last row classroom , [ Xiao Zhang ] recognize teacher 's face clearly identify small hand write blackboard clearly . Would say [ Zhang ] 's distance eyesight : 1 . Excellent , 2 . Good , 3 . Fair , 4 . Poor , 5 . Very poor . Two vignette design study . More specifically , two hypothetical person common Chinese name , Xiao Wang Xiao Zhang introduce survey , would mention V1 V2 follow discussion . V1 : In din hall , [ Xiao Wang ] difficulty see student table clearly see student next table clearly . V2 : Sitting last row classroom , [ Xiao Zhang ] recognize teacher 's face clearly identify small hand write blackboard clearly . The two vignette design ascend level visual acuity vignette arrange questionnaire way : V1 V2 . The question DCV , `` Would say distance eyesight well Wang 's , Wang 's , bad Wang 's ? '' question ICV , `` Would say Wang 's distance eyesight excellent , good , fair , poor , poor ? '' respectively . Objective visual acuity - The simplified Snellen chart consist letter `` E '' different direction , approve National Bureau Standards China national standard test visual acuity ( GB115331989 ) . It approve Ministry Health use nationwide China March 27th , 1989 . The simplified Snellen chart use estimate visual acuity respondent stand 5 meter . The measurement range 4.0 5.3 , arithmetic sequence 0.1 progression . The large number , good respondent 's vision . Capability respond eye chart likely independent educational level . Furthermore , simplify Snellen chart also rule difficulty Snellen letter common misidentifications ( Mathew , Shah et al . 2011 ) . Therefore , less likely standard Snellen chart underestimate true vision due low literacy rate . In line vision 4.0 , one letter `` E '' present , line vision 4.1 , two `` E '' s. Except two line , probability overestimate true vision 0.1 due chance alone small 6.25 % ( i.e. , 1/64 ) , since correct response least three `` E '' line require survey experiment . More specifically , probability guess direction one letter `` E '' correctly chance 1/4 probability guess direction three `` E '' correctly chance 1/64 . Using eye examination gold standard , empirical research address validity vignette method .</detailed_description>
