	<brief_summary>The researcher prove certain compound play important role prevention skin cancer . Researcher use specific compound , classify metabolic enzyme , low concentration complete absent skin cancer cell . Researcher biopsies normal skin precancerous cancerous lesion , compare concentration compound determine difference two area . The result lead understand skin cancer pre-cancers . Because skin cancer pre-cancers common , knowledge would useful many people future may use development future treatment prevention strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biopsy procedure do Beckman Laser Institute Dermatology Clinic Gottschalk Medical Plaza , University California , Irvine . Standard procedure punch biopsy do area determine physician researcher . The normal skin biopsy obtain area skin without suspicious lesion locate area body . Biopsy specimens store frozen Beckman Laser Institute chemistry-lab research assign subject ID number , personnel health information attach skin specimen . There cost subject insurer participation study , except specific scenario suspect skin cancer would undergo biopsy regardless participation study . The time commitment subject approximately 1 hour set biopsy . Researchers test hypothesis expression key metabolic enzyme reduce and/or lose skin cancer progression . Total ribonucleic acid , single-stranded biologic molecule involve gene transcription , regulation , translation , isolate biopsied skin specimen . Quantitative Real-Time perform determine expression level several key metabolic enzyme . Metabolic enzymes regulate several vital signal pathway human body . Some example include hormone bioactive lipid regulation . Aberrant regulation signal pathway lead human disease include cancer . Recent evidence show metabolic enzyme call UGT gene call UDP-glucuronosyltransferases show significantly reduce expression breast tumor compare normal breast tissue patient This observed loss expression hypothesize causal two enzyme responsible estrogen metabolism . However , relatively little known metabolic enzyme skin cancer . We preliminary data UGT enzyme expression lose melanoma progression allow deregulate lipoxygenase signal .</detailed_description>
