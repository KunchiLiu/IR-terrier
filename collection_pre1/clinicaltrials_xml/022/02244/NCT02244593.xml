	<brief_summary>Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) show accurate test detect breast cancer however , MRI always reliable indicate presence cancer reality , none ; call 'false positive ' result . A history breast carcinoma alone qualify patient ongoing monitoring breast MRI . This study do assess new technique call FAST breast MRI . A FAST breast MRI different traditional breast MRI much few sequence take approximately 3 minute scan . MRI sequence combination magnetic pulse collect information tissue . There radiation associate MRI . The purpose study determine impact patient health FAST breast MRI use screen technique woman personal history cancer . It show FAST breast MRI similar routine breast MRI detection breast cancer , prove FAST breast MRI help woman personal history breast cancer . Currently , routine breast MRI part standard care screen breast cancer woman prior personal history breast cancer . By evaluate FAST MRI investigator able study effect short MRI cancer detection woman personal history breast cancer , impact overall health . The investigator estimate 300 participant enrol study The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre The Ottawa Hospital , General Campus Women 's Breast Health Centre The Ottawa Hospital , Civic Campus . All participant history breast carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FAST MRI Study Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given demand breast MRI screen breast cancer survivor oncologist , plan perform randomize controlled trial select patient population breast cancer survivor would normally eligible breast MRI screening . This study determine whether use FAST MRI addition mammography reduce anxiety patient compare current standard care : mammography alone . If turns reduce anxiety , next step would conduct large-scale multi-centre randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate whether FAST MRI sensitive whether increased sensitivity lead improved clinical outcome . The purpose study determine impact patient anxiety FAST Breast MRI surveillance technique woman personal history breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>English French speak female patient age 18 year , personal history diagnosis breast carcinoma ( include ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) invasive ductal lobular carcinoma ) within past 10 year . Patients must complete treatment breast cancer . Moderate risk recurrence breast cancer , define lifetime risk breast cancer great 12 % ( average risk ) less 25 % ( high risk ) define use Breast Ovarian Analysis Disease Incidence Carrier Estimation Algorithm ( BOADICEA ) model ( see Appendix A ) Patients undergone unilateral mastectomy breast conservation surgery . Normal renal function : estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &gt; 30 ml/min/m2 Patients unable undergo MRI , due either physical mental issue ( i.e . : anxiety severe claustrophobia ) . Also , patient know allergy gadolinium , severe renal failure exclude . Pregnant breastfeeding patient . Patients breast MRI within last 6 month . Patients already receive highrisk breast MRI screening , Ontario Breast Screening Program ( OBSP ) highrisk program Women 's Breast Health Center ( WBHC ) highrisk program . Patients undergone bilateral mastectomy . Poor renal function : estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 30 ml/min/m2</criteria>
