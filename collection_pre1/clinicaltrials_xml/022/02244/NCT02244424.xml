	<brief_title>Tools For Teen Moms : Reducing Infant Obesity Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid weight gain infancy one strongest risk factor obesity later childhood . Weight gain infancy closely link feeding practice . Unhealthy mother-infant feeding practice contribute rapid and/or excessive infant weight gain . Lower-income , adolescent , first-time mother less likely engage infant-centered feeding ( ICF ) characterize maternal responsiveness ( MR ) , healthy feeding style ( FS ) , healthy feeding practice ( FP ) . ICF need reduce rapid/excessive weight gain first six month life foster infant feed self-regulation associate healthy growth . ICF critical factor reduce infant obesity risk later adverse health condition . Practical early intervention strategy necessary promote ICF among adolescent mother reduce obesity risk . We propose Baby Dayr , novel social medium intervention platform design investigator include cell phone text message reminder , infant feeding website , Facebook increase ICF daily behavioral challenge activity ( `` challenge '' ) population . Because cell phone permit natural , frequent non-intrusive contact time-or-place-dependent , offer innovative strategy intervene adolescent mother . However , approach untested feasibility population regard infant feeding practice . We propose exploratory , longitudinal , randomize , two-group study design . The three specific aim : 1 ) establish preliminary efficacy intervention assess infant growth evaluate pre-intervention , immediately post intervention , infant six month old ; 2 ) establish preliminary efficacy Baby Dayr plus Maternal-Infant Health Program ( MIHP ) care vs. MIHP care infant-centered feeding ( MR , FS , FP ) mediate maternal knowledge self-efficacy ; 3 ) establish feasibility , acceptability , satisfaction social medium intervention ( Baby Dayr ) low-income adolescent , first-time mother assess : 1 ) rate enrollment completion daily challenge , 2 ) acceptability rating Baby Dayr ; 3 ) satisfaction Baby Dayr . Participants randomly assign intervention ( Baby Dayr MIHP ) ( n = 40 ) control group ( MIHP care ) ( n = 40 ) . The intervention consist six week daily challenge deliver start infant four six week old . The study innovative : 1 ) assessment ICF reduce rapid/excessive infant weight gain first six month life low-income , adolescent , first-time mother-infant dyad , 2 ) combination infant-centered skill-building , educational , coach approach use social medium accessible suitable adolescent . The propose research significant contribute science relate ICF knowledge regard use social medium platform at-risk population lead reduce risk infant obesity . Information gain study use refine intervention use larger-scale , longitudinal , randomize , control trial reduce obesity risk infant low-income , adolescent mother .</detailed_description>
