	<brief_summary>Healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) significant public health burden . Even existence recommendation technical strategy prevent infection , need strategy increase staff engagement within local organizational cultural context . Positive deviance one approach engage people improvement effort . Positive Deviance base observation every community certain individual group whose uncommon behavior strategy enable find good solution problem peer , access resource face similar worse challenge . In proposed study , investigator plan test effectiveness use positive deviance base horizontal infection prevention approach achieve overall reduction HAIs among hospital inpatient . The investigator hypothesize broad horizontal approach reduce opportunity acquisition nosocomial pathogen use PD lead great reduction HAI among hospital inpatient compare standard-of-care infection control approach . The investigator objective test investigator hypothesis evaluate whether great decline rate HAI experimental group ward compare control group ward .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Positive Deviance Inpatient Wards Reduce Hospital Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate whether positive deviance ( PD ) base horizontal infection prevention approach result high rate decline incidence density patient HAI ( central line-associated bloodstream infection , healthcare-associated pneumonia , catheter-associated urinary tract infection , Clostridium difficile infection ) per 1000 patient day per month intervention ward compare control ward . Design : A cluster randomize control trial conduct period 24 month . Six medical ward randomize positive deviance intervention randomly allocate one two group three ward . The baseline , intervention follow-up period 6 , 9 9 month respectively . Setting : A public safety-net major teach hospital United States . Participants : The ward staff participate intervention . Intervention : Key component intervention invitation participate voluntarily , open-ended dialogue staff member discover barrier seek solution prevent HAI , discussion outcome , encouragement prioritize implement solution generate . Staffs six ward ask voluntarily participate modify hospital survey patient safety climate ( HSOPSC ) social network survey 6 , 15 , 24 month . Statistical analysis : Statistical method use time series modeling , summary frequency , Chi-square Fisher 's exact test difference proportion t-test .</detailed_description>
