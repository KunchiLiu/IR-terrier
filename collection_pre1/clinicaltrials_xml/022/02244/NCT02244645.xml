	<brief_title>Effects Yoga Versus Passive Modality Pain , Disability , Salivary Cortisol Concentrations , Brain- Derived Neurotropic Factor , Heart Rate Variability Immune Functions Among Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain common problem , 70-80 % adult bother life , influence work quality life . Yoga one popular complementary alternative medicine back pain , mind-body intervention increasingly choose effectively treat chronic pain . This parallel-arm randomized control trial compare outcomes participant assign experimental treatment group ( yoga , 36 participant ) assign passive modality control group 3 month ( 12 week ) . Each group receive regular 60-minutes yoga class passive modality twice week . The investigator confer difference pain relief functional life improvement passive modality yoga . The latter expect positive effect Chronic low back pain . The effect possible mechanisms action responsible passive modality yoga salivary cortisol concentration , inflammatory cytokine autonomic nervous tone also evaluate . The study 's primary endpoint ( 1 ) back pain relief , ( 2 ) functional life improve , ( 3 ) Salivary cortisol concentration decrease , ( 4 ) brain-derived neurotrophic factor improve , ( 5 ) heart rate variability improve , ( 6 ) immune function improve significantly among participant experimental group control group . This study may clarify potential promising mechanism clearest evidence support value yoga therapeutic option reduce chronic low back pain . If result positive , clinician attain option treat patient chronic low back . Furthermore , positive result study help focus future in-depth research promise potential mechanism action identifies .</detailed_description>
