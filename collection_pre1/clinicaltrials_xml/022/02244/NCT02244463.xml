	<brief_summary>This research study study target therapy ( ML0N128 ) possible treatment anaplastic thyroid cancer . This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve MLN0128 treatment disease . MLN0128 prevent tumor cell divide grow selectively potently inhibit chemical , mTOR kinase , regulate cell growth survival . Patients anaplastic thyroid cancer observe sometimes carry genetic alteration tumor cell may make cancer sensitive inhibition MLN0128 . In research study , investigator investigate usefulness MLN0128 metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer case .</brief_summary>
