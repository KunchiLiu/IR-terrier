	<detailed_description>Psychosis set symptom associate distorted perception cognition . Clinical treatment focus positive symptom , hallucination , delusion increasingly well develop throughout century . However peripheral facet depressive mood ( post-psychotic depression extreme ) anxiety never foci attention ; often view less important positive , negative , cognitive symptom , entirely ignore . Sadly , depression anxiety prevalent early psychotic patient . Depression find 22 % people First Episode Psychosis ( FEP ) , anxiety disorder social phobia find 32 % , obsessive compulsive disorder 4-15 % people FEP . These adverse condition early acute stage psychosis link poor engagement treatment service adverse impact change process , result poor treatment outcome , lower quality life , increase likelihood suicide . Given high prevalence extensive impact , need explore adjunction intervention target mood anxiety symptom follow onset psychotic disorder . Mindfulness awareness emerge pay attention present moment without judgment . It skill achieve meditation practice , show improve general well-being . Mindfulness-based intervention ( MBI ) refer `` third wave '' psychological intervention first wave behavioral second wave cognitive intervention . Research relate MBIs increase exponentially past decade . Key , fully develop , MBIs literature include mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) acceptance commitment therapy ( ACT ) . These intervention increasingly used individual suffer depression anxiety gain positive finding . Hofmann colleague conduct effect size analysis 39 study MBI anxiety mood symptom clinical sample . They find moderately strong uncontrolled pre-post effect size MBIs reduce anxiety symptom depressive symptom among individual disorder limit anxiety disorder major depression . The author postulate MBIs may diagnosis-specific . Rather effective reduce stress general hence improve symptom anxiety depression across relatively wide range condition . Since MBIs efficacious reduce mood anxiety symptom across various disorder , potential intervention value early psychosis well . In recent meta-review , Khoury colleague conclude MBIs moderate therapeutic effect psychosis . At time , argument mindfulness practice active psychotic patient , people risk develop psychosis . In response , Chadwick et al . demonstrate feasibility study safe use mindfulness intervention nine active psychotic patient . Given small sample size , careful research , especially randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , need support usage . Evidence mindfulness-based intervention treatment mood anxiety symptom encourage . Yet , small number RCTs conduct patient early psychosis date . Further , limited resource available health system Hong Kong , aim create simple MBI specific early psychosis patient , user-friendly protocol operate health practitioner sufficient yet time-efficient training . Therefore , current RCT protocol assess efficacy brief MBI patient early psychosis value . The primary research question whether positive change depressive anxiety symptom obtain 7-week MBI program design early psychotic patient . Specifically , hypothesize anxiety level depressive mood significantly reduce MBI . The second question seek answer whether change maintain , reflect 3-month follow . Our secondary hypothesis since depression anxiety lower , receive MBI perceive good quality life overall functioning result</detailed_description>
