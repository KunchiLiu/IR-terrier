	<brief_summary>Severe combine Immunodeficiencies ( SCID ) group inherit disease immune system characterise profound abnormality T cell development . Infants SCID require prompt clinical response Prevent life -threatening infection study show significantly improve survival baby Diagnosed birth result previous family history . SCID follow criterion population -based newborn screening since asymptomatic birth fatal within first year life , confirmation disease easy , curative treatment , know early stem cell transplantation improve survival . Quantification TRECs ( T- cell receptor excision circle ) DNA extract Guthrie sample sensitive screen test Specific SCID . The investigator propose study perform neonatal screening SCID , population 200,000 baby period two year . The investigator propose study clinical utility cost effectiveness ratio , SCID screen demonstrate could result broad benefit Individuals detect , make screen relatively cost-effective spite low incidence disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project propose study feasibility cost-effectiveness ratio ( time management life expectancy 10 year ) generalize neonatal screening SCID child offer screen 200 000 child ( 100 000 child per year ) entire territory . Prospective control group consist child diagnose SCID 700,000 annual birth benefit screen . The protocol leant exist newborn screening , say two drop blood place second Guthrie card current screening ( 72 hour life ) perform parent ' information consent . Eleven newborn screen regional association involve inclusion child 50 maternity hospital . The card drawn protocol follow usual network except test quantify TRECs realize two laboratory instead eleven laboratory assign RA . Investigative Regional Associations ( RAs ) represent nearly 600,000 birth / year amount 200,000 child achieve two year ( duration inclusion ) . All child bear participate maternity may include meet inclusion criterion . The result screen test SCID available within 21 day birth , provide need request new sample . At eleven RA associate pediatrician referent immune deficiency , member french reference center ( CEREDIH ) responsible call parent , offer consultation exploration result screening assume positive . Analysis card 200,000 child give follow information : - Number child presumptive positive screening , require call referent pediatrician , consultation exploration lymphocyte subpopulation - Number child negative screen - Number child inconclusive screening ( lack TRECs lack amplification reference gene ) require new card , A micro- costing study conduct assess cost testing . This group 200,000 child experimental group ass cost screening , acceptability parent ( participation rate ) , recall rate abnormal inconclusive result , rate follow-up time result , incidence disease . It also allow calculate specificity method . At end inclusion , vital status 18 month cause death seek 200 000 child include , CESP ( Centre de Recherche en Epidemiologie et Santé de Populations ) via RNIPP ( Répertoire National d'Identification de Personnes Physiques ) CepiDc ( Centre d'Epidémiologie sur le cause médicales de décès ) . This establish whether SCID population detect birth . Furthermore , investigator include study SCID child diagnose without screen pediatrician local referent DIP ( include Necker main transplant center ) . This enable approach sensitivity method . All data allow calculation predictive value test . In experimental group isolate group individual screen positive diagnose true SCID . Clinical data patient collect electronic CRF ( CRF ) pediatrician referral protocol ( Dr Thomas C ) , include : - The date result exploration : lymphocyte subpopulation , blood count , determination immunoglobulin level - The diagnosis make identification genetic defect - The date care curative treatment ( protected area isolation , anti -infective drug ) - , Bacterial , fungal anti -viral treatment , - The date transplant , type transplant treatment ... ...</detailed_description>
