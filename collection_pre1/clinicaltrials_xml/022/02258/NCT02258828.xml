	<brief_summary>Twenty six veteran PTSD cognitive impairment receive 16 week memantine open label fashion . Cognition assess use Spatial Span , Logical Memory I , Letter-Number Sequencing subtests Wechsler Memory Scale III ( Third edition ) Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) . RBANS measure attention , language , visuospatial skill , immediate delay memory . The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAM-D ) , Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ) , Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( Q-LES-Q ) , Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) use assess improvement PTSD symptom , secondary outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial Memantine Cognitive Impairment Patients With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center follow local IRB approval . We obtain write consent subject recruit study . Veterans age 19 65 year chronic PTSD ( diagnosis &gt; 6 month ) attributable military combat exposure include study . Patients require clinically stable psychotropic medication regimen least three month prior study entry . In addition meeting DSM-IV criterion PTSD endorse subjective complaint memory difficulty , patient score least one standard deviation mean performance standardize , age- sex-matched population Spatial Span , Logical Memory I , Letter-Number Sequencing subtests Wechsler Memory Scale III ( Third edition ) study entry . Patients history dementia , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , traumatic brain injury , seizure exclude . Patients history alcohol illicit drug abuse dependence within past one month exclude . Patients require concomitant treatment drug potential effect glutamergic system , amantadine , dextromethorphan , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , exclude . Subjects initially receive memantine 5 mg daily , increased weekly 5 mg/day divide dos dose 20 mg/day . Memory assess use Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) [ Randolph , 1998 ] use form A B baseline , end week 8 , end week 16 . The RBANS compose 10 subtests yield total score five index score : immediate memory , visuospatial/constructional , language , attention , delayed memory . Each index score normal mean 100 standard deviation 15 base performance standardization sample match U.S. Census sex , ethnicity , level education . Alternative form RBANS ( Forms A B ) use avoid bias due practice effect . We administer Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAM-D ) , Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ) , Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( Q-LES-Q ) , Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) ass secondary measure . Changes score time repeat measure estimate mixed-effects model . The primary outcome measure interest index percentile score RBANS total subscale score . The repeated measure model include visit ( categorical variable ) fix effect . An unstructured covariance matrix use fit within patient repeat measure effect . Tukey 's method use compare pair-wise mean . Secondary outcome measure , CAPS , HAM-A , HAM-D , Q-LES-Q , SDS , analyze similarly RBANS repeat measure model . P-values less 0.05 consider statistically significant . SAS software version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) use analysis</detailed_description>
