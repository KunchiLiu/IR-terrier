	<brief_summary>Purpose study - The purpose study develop evaluate efficacy new , theoretically base intervention improve medication adherence person HF . The hypothesis include : Hypothesis I . Poorly adherent patient symptomatic HF receive intervention ( n=40 ) adherent medicine the12-month intervention control group ( n=40 ) poorly adherent patient symptomatic HF . Hypothesis II . Poorly adherent patient symptomatic HF receive intervention ( n=40 ) few hospital readmission ( HR ) emergency department ( ED ) visit 12-month intervention control group poorly adherent patient symptomatic HF . Study Activities population - A prospective , randomize control design use pilot test efficacy new intervention promote adherence medication regimen chronic heart failure clinical setting . The initial development feasibility test intervention complete ( Preliminary Work , Section 4.5 ) . Patients HF symptom exacerbation ( n = 80 ) exhibit high likelihood poor adherence , determine validate screening measure , Medication Adherence Scale ( MAS ) 89 baseline assessment , recruit randomized receive intervention usual care attention control . Medication adherence , symptom frequency intensity , hospital readmission ( HR ) emergency department ( ED ) visit assess group 3 , 6 12-month clinic visit . The interval visit consider sufficient minimize sensitization bias psychometric measure . Longitudinal measurement require evaluate magnitude change adherence symptom-related event occur time . Efficacy measure improved adherence ( primary outcome ) decrease HR ED visit ( secondary outcome ) intervention group compare attention control group 12 month . The study close patient 12-month post-enrollment clinic visit . Data Analysis &amp; Safety/Risk Considerations - The investigator use generalize linear model test primary secondary hypothesis ( McCullagh Nelder , 1989 ) . Logistic generalization traditional , multivariate GLM appropriate dependent variable binary probability event model , case adherence study . When dependent variable count , commonly use generalized model use natural logarithm count , re-hospitalizations ED visit study . In compliance NIH guideline data safety monitoring activity , number quality control step use ensure on-going safety participant scientific integrity feasibility intervention study . The propose study pose minimal risk participant . All participant receive usual care . Participation study replace patient ' regular health care attention . Data safety monitor PI , Data Safety Officer ( Dr. Karl Swedberg ) , study co-investigators . Any adverse event report immediately Duke IRB NIH . Data Safety . First , project database construct , use participant ID number include demographic , pre- post-intervention history assessment material . A separate file , cross-referencing participant identification project ID number , maintain access limited PI designate member investigative team .</brief_summary>
