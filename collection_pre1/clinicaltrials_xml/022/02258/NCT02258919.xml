	<detailed_description>Background Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) remain devastating disease mortality rate 52 % 30 day . It major public health problem annual incidence 10-30 per 100'000 population , account 2 million ( 10-15 % ) 15 million stroke worldwide year . One-third patient ICH die within one month majority survivor remain handicapped . Neurological injury result ICH mediate mass effect hematoma , secondary brain edema and/or mechanism . Treatment ICH one major unresolved issue acute stroke treatment . The International Surgical Trials Intracerebral Hemorrhage ( STICH STICH II ) randomize control trial show superiority surgical treatment compare conservative treatment approach . Nevertheless , surgical treatment ICH remain matter debate attempt improve outcome use surgical therapy still ongoing . Many effort make minimize invasiveness operative procedure clot evacuation . However , direct surgical intervention aim removal hematoma fail improve neurological outcome subtypes ICH , especially deep-seated hematoma . The trauma open craniotomy especially trauma brain parenchyma hematoma evacuation consider outweigh benefit surgery . Decompressive craniectomy ( DC ) , beneficial patient malignant middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) infarction , may indirectly relieve mass effect , decrease perihematomal tissue pressure , improve blood flow , reduce secondary brain damage improve outcome without damage brain due surgery . Consequently , DC establish standard surgical therapy patient malignant MCA infarction level evidence grade 2 . Decompressive craniectomy acute stroke one effective treatment available : number need treat save one patient 's life 2 . Decompressive craniectomy also standard therapeutic procedure patient ICH due sinus venous thrombosis , herpes encephalitis , rupture intracranial aneurysm . In patient traumatic brain injury DC standard therapy reduce elevate intracranial pressure . The investigator others assess whether DC feasible beneficial patient spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage . The investigator show previous retrospective trial DC patient supratentorial ICH safe feasible may reduce mortality compare match control best medical treatment alone . The limitation feasibility trial retrospective design , small sample size inhomogeneity patient cohort respect origin ICH . Furthermore , feasibility trial decision DC take individual basis rather accord strict protocol , introduce potential selection bias . Nevertheless , preliminary result encourage . Recently , three human trial , one animal study , one meta-analysis , one original contribution publish topic . However , prospective randomize trial ever assess whether DC without hematoma evacuation patient acute ICH improve outcome . All recent study show promising result call initiation randomize control trial . Objective The primary objective randomize control trial determine whether decompressive surgery best medical treatment patient spontaneous ICH improve outcome compare best medical treatment . Secondary objective analyze mortality , dependency quality life . Safety endpoint determine cause mortality rate medical surgical complication DC compare best medical treatment alone . Methods All patient suspect intracerebral hemorrhage consider trial . Randomization eligible patient perform within 66 hour ictus patient stable clot volume surgery later 6 hour randomization . Patients randomize control group receive best medical treatment accord international guideline . Patients randomized treatment group receive best medical treatment DC least 12cm accord institutional guideline surgical protocol . The primary outcome death dependency 6 month assess trained person unaware treatment allocation . Favorable outcome define modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) score 0 4 , poor outcome modify Rankin Scale score 5 6 .</detailed_description>
