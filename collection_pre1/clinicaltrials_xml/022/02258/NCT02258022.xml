	<detailed_description>Breath delta value hypothesize biomarker infection . Breath delta value define clinical outcome relate human health , study seek establish breath delta value biomarker infection . This study measure feasibility Isomark Canaryâ„¢ device . If Canary n't detect significant decrease breath delta value subject subsequently get infection , feasible use purpose . Breath delta value collect determine relationship infection , health outcome measure . In single-center study 110 subject , breath sample collect 6 time per day blood sample collect per day 7 day . Subjects follow additional 3 day . Analysis result sample combine data abstract subject ' medical record . The investigator hypothesize measurement 13C/12C delta value exhale breath adult early indicator infection subject systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary trauma .</detailed_description>
