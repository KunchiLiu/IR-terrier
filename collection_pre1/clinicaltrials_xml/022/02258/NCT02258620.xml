	<detailed_description>The radial approach favor coronary angiography due several advantage : reduction local bleeding risk , even hemorragiparic situation , decrease downtime time reduction hospitalization , improve patient ulterior comfort . However , approach subject immediate major complication radial artery spasm ( RAS ) , accord criterion use , average incidence 30 % . The administration vasodilator coronary angiography procedure enable increase radial artery diameter thus decrease friction probe . Theoretically prevent occurrence RAS . The literature re-counts several vasodilator product test ( DN calcic blocker , magnesium sulfate , alpha-adrenergic antagonist ... ) various route administration ( direct intravenous route ( IV ) , subcutaneous inject route , direct intra-arterial route ( IA ) ) . Overall intra-arterial DN appear efficient . The downside brief , painful thermal sensation intense notably unpleasant . IV injection well tolerate direct injection without proof superiority IA . The para-radial subcutaneous injection study facilitate access radial artery . The investigator randomize study compare , first time , effectiveness transdermal administration trinitrine ( D ) continuous intravenous dinitrate isosorbide ( V ) dinitrate isosorbide intraarterial ( A ) standard .</detailed_description>
