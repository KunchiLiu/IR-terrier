	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) carboplatin follow response-based local therapy treat patient stage III IV human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -related oropharyngeal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , carboplatin , hydroxyurea , fluorouracil , paclitaxel , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving nab-paclitaxel carboplatin chemoradiation may make tumor small reduce amount chemotherapy radiation therapy need . Assigning chemotherapy radiation therapy base response ( response-based therapy ) give patient respond well low dos treatment may help reduce occurrence side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Clinical complete response rate ( nab-paclitaxel base induction , compare European Prospective Investigation Cancer Nutrition [ EPIC ] induction [ paclitaxel base ] ) . II . Response rate ( nab-paclitaxel base induction , compare EPIC induction [ paclitaxel base ] ) . III . Proportion patient &gt; = 50 % shrinkage Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ( nab-paclitaxel base induction , compare EPIC induction , paclitaxel base ) . IV . Toxicity ( nab-paclitaxel base induction , compare EPIC induction [ paclitaxel base ] ) . V. To assess swallow function speech 6 month ( mo ) 12 mos post therapy . VI . To determine rate late toxicity chemoradiation follow surgery determine xerostomia , dental decay , osteroradionecrosis , G-tube dependency , tracheostomy placement dysphagia . VII . 2-year overall survival ( OS ) patient treat Low-Risk , Intermediate-Risk Arm , High-Risk Arms . VIII . 2-year PFS patient treat Low-Risk , Intermediate-Risk Arm , High-Risk Arms - early late toxicity . IX . Evaluate need post radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy ( RT/CRT ) surgery low- intermediate-risk arm base response induction chemotherapy . X . Evaluate descriptive manner role transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) resection/lymph node dissection ( LND ) integrate de-escalation trial . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pathologic/histologic appearance tumor induction chemotherapy CRT . II . Translational research blood tissue sample . III . To profile tumor genetically immunologically order assess descriptive manner genetic immunological feature characteristic clinical behavior . OUTLINE : INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : All patient receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group base response induction chemotherapy . GROUP A ( LOW-DOSE ARM ) : Patients undergo radiation therapy daily 5 week . GROUP B ( INTERMEDIATE-DOSE ARM ) : Patients receive hydroxyurea orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 0-5 , fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 , paclitaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive low-dose radiation therapy BID day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP C ( STANDARD-DOSE ARM ) : Patients receive hydroxyurea PO BID day 0-5 , fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 , paclitaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive standard-dose radiation therapy BID day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . * *NOTE : At discretion principal investigator ( PI ) , patient may receive cisplatin IV 1-3 hour every 3 week radiation therapy instead paclitaxel undergo daily radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
