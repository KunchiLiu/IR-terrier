	<detailed_description>Postoperative venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) significant health-care problem , result significant morbidity , mortality resource utilization . The true incidence unknown , may range 1 % 15 % . The late American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) guideline VTE prevention clearly outline perioperative thromboprophylaxis regiment specific surgical population . Specifically patient undergo orthopaedic procedure , total hip replacement , strong Grade 1A evidence use extend thromboprophylaxis . For surgical subgroup vascular thoracic surgery , evidence less clear . Therefore current time , clinical practice VTE prophylaxis thoracic surgery include administration unfractionated low molecular weight heparin start perioperative period finishing time patient ' discharge . Prolonged thromboprophylaxis orthopaedic surgery beyond 10 day 35 day become standard care Grade 1A recommendation ACCP . This approach never test validated thoracic surgery , major lung resection expose patient increase VTE risk due surgical stress existence malignancy , also due direct in-situ vascular injury secondary resection pulmonary arterial branch lung resection . Hence , clear need systematically evaluate incidence VTE resection lung malignancy evaluate role extend VTE prophylaxis prevent DVT pulmonary embolus ( PE ) major lung resection . The study involve patient undergo sub-lobar resection , lobectomy , bilobectomy pneumonectomy lung cancer metastatic lung disease St. Joseph 's Healthcare Hamilton , regional tertiary thoracic surgery program 350 major lung resection perform within institution annually , well University Health Network 's Toronto General Hospital . The study evaluate incidence post-operative venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) include 150 consecutively recruited patient . Study intervention include Computed Tomography pulmonary embolus ( PE ) protocol bilateral extend leg Doppler Ultrasound detection Deep Vein Thrombosis 30 day post-surgery . In summary , study aim evaluate , first time prospective manner , actual incidence DVT PE patient undergo major lung resection malignancy . The knowledge gain study use inform future investigation involve RCT compare current post-operative thromboprophylaxis extend 30-day prophylaxis protocol hope provide evidence-based practice change VTE prophylaxis care high risk population .</detailed_description>
