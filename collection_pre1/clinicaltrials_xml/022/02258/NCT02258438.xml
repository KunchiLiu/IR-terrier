	<brief_title>Effect Breaking Prolonged Sitting Metabolic Flexibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although public-health recommendation engage moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( least 30min , 5 day / week ) widely promulgated government , people physically inactive . Sedentary behavior , like time spend sit , associate serious implication metabolic health , indicate even individual regularly exercise reduction time spend sit confer health benefit . Encouraging recent evidence show walk break throughout day effective strategy offset deleterious effect prolong uninterrupted sitting . Further data however need well understand effect microbursts activity along day . We propose project determine effect 3 day frequent interruption prolong sit metabolic health healthy overweight sedentary adult ( n=24 ) , compare 3 day include single long bout isocaloric exercise control condition subject exercise subject prolonged sitting . Plasma glucose , insulin , triglyceride free fatty acid concentration use substrate ( glucose , fat protein ) provide energy body response meal consumption measure day 3 three condition . We furthermore assess ability participant perform intervention physical activity end day three day intervention ( 2 day free-living condition one day control environment ) . We believe propose project provide initial evidence base health benefit break prolonged sit short burst moderate-intensity activity , like walk . This innovative strategy may effective combat adverse effect sedentary behavior traditional approach like structured exercise .</detailed_description>
