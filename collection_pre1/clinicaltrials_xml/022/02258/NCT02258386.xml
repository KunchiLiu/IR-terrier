	<brief_summary>The aim present study implement novel body-worn sensor , ZephyrTM BioModule ( register name wearable sensor device use study ) , assess physical activity physiological measure clinical set together clinical routine assessment . Our specific aim explore whether specific physical activity pattern physiological measure associate delirium hospital inpatient . Our ultimate goal early detection intervention delirium , good management monitoring activity pattern physiological information . The ZephyrTM U.S. FDA-approved wireless , ambulatory physiological monitoring device consist data logger transmitter unit attach location 5th intercostal space use specifically design patch ( BioPatchTM ) standard ECG electrodes . The ZephyrTM design long-term measurement patient 's physical activity physiological measure . By use physical activity parameter physiological measure , specific delirium risk profile compute patient . Finally , association delirium risk profile CAM-ICU questionnaire gold standard assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent Protected Health Information ( PHI ) consent , CAM-ICU ( Confusion Assessment Method ICU ) measure routinely unit nurse shift . Results available medical record . We measure physical activity physiological measure ( e.g . ECG , heart rate , respiration rate , body temperature ) use unobtrusive body worn sensor . This sensor attach 5th intercostal space use specifically design patch ( BioPatchTM ) allow quantification physical activity walking , stand , sit , lie , well measurement physiological parameter . These measurement available research team available nurse inpatient study unit . Medical history ( clinic chart ) demographic information obtain , age , gender , weight , height well detail ( e.g . injury , fall score number fall ) happen hospital stay . The research test consist one core measurement one ancillary measurement ( require ) list ( Note - ancillary measurement may require everyone ) . Core measurement Assessment physical activity physiological measure : Patients ask wear Zephyr BioModule period 24 hour maximum stay hospital . The Zephyr BioModule attach patient 5th intercostal space use specifically design patch ( BioPatchTM ) . Ancillary Measurements Upper Extremity Test : A validated body worn sensor ( LEGSys™ , Biosensics LLC ) use evaluate upper extremity kinematics ( angular velocity ) . This simple test patient flex extend arm 20 second arm . Analysis plan : To predict risk delirium use physical activity physiological data , patient participate study categorize presence delirium base CAM-ICU questionnaire . Logistic regression analysis use examine relation physical activity variable ( e.g . lying time ) physiological measure ( e.g . heart rate ) delirium risk . Firstly , univariate logistic regression , use presence delirium dependent variable , employ investigate relationship test variable . The Odd Ratios ( OR ) coefficient determination ( R2 ) calculate explanatory variable . Then multivariate logistic regression use stepwise-automated method perform investigate independent effect physical activity variable physiological measure predict delirium . Sensitivities , specificity , positive negative predictive value different cut-off value calculate non-categorical variable show independent effect predict delirium . A two-sided P-value ≤0.05 consider statistically significant . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) statistic 22.0 ( IBM , Armonk ( name town ) , NY ( New York ) , USA ) .</detailed_description>
