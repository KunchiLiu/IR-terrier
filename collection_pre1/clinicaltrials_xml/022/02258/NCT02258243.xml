	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize phase II trial study well photodynamic therapy use blue light red light work treat basal cell cancer ( carcinoma ) patient genetic condition cause unusual facial feature disorder skin , bone , nervous system , eye , endocrine gland , also call basal cell nevus syndrome . Photodynamic therapy use drug , aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride , take tumor cell expose intensive light source ( blue light red light ) become active may kill cell . It yet know whether photodynamic therapy effective blue light red light treat basal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using Blue Light Red Light Treating Basal Cell Carcinoma Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether cyclic photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treatment effective cure exist basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) tumor patient basal cell nevus syndrome ( BCNS ) , whether red light blue light effective regard . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess tolerability ( pain treatment ) red light versus blue light patient population . II . To assess patient satisfaction technique . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically . Beginning 4 hour later , patient undergo photodynamic therapy use blue light leave side body red light right side body day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 2 month 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically . Beginning 4 hour later , patient undergo photodynamic therapy use blue light right side body red light leave side body day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 2 month 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
