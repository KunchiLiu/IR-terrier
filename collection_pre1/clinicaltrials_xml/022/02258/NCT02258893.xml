	<brief_title>Indoor Air Pollution Children With Asthma : An Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We design randomize , double-blind , triple cross-over intervention study examine efficacy indoor NO2 reduction reduce asthma severity . Since particle NO2 byproducts combustion associate gas stove use , intervention protocol include condition use filter design remove particle also implicate asthma exacerbation ( e.g. , coarse , fine ultrafine particle include airborne mold spore allergens ) leave NO2 virtually untouched . Primary secondary aim trial include , respectively , determine whether reduce exposure NO2 particle compare `` control '' ( non-filtered ) condition result clinically significant reduction asthma severity measure difference day symptoms intervention arm . Families asthmatic child age 5-11 recruit selected community use : ( 1 ) flyer distribute elementary school , ( 2 ) postcard send family purchase mail list , ( 3 ) poster place community building ( library , clinic , etc. ) . Volunteers screen preliminary eligibility base household characteristic active asthmatic status . Potentially eligible family home gas cook stave few seven room . Potentially eligible child age 5-11 ; asthma symptom and/or medication use consistent severity score category 2 ( mild persistent ) , 3 ( moderate ) , 4 ( severe ) previous 12 month ; reside least 5 day night every week eligible home . Households meet preliminary criterion ask participate passive NO2 sampling . A single Palmes tube send home placement main living space one week . Families call one week instructed cap return NO2 monitor pre-paid mailer . Families child live home one-week integrated average NO2 concentration &gt; 20 ppb invite participate . We permit enrollment one eligible child per family . Participating family randomize one 6 treatment sequence require 3 period 4-weeks precede 1-week washout period . Randomization block every 18 subject randomize 3 sequence . Randomization conduct blindly data management department schedule initial interview/air clean installation assign treatment sequence ( refer machine filter already site ) . Minimization technique use balance randomize allocation necessary . Total subject participation time 18 week .</detailed_description>

Based symptoms medication , asthma severity categorize score adapted Global Initiative Asthma guideline ( 1=mild transient , 2=mild persistent , 3=moderate , 4=severe ) . Only child category 2 ( mild persistent , 3 ( moderate ) 4 ( severe ) eligible . ] For potential subject satisfy inclusion criterion , passive NO2 monitor send home placement main living space one week . Families call one week instructed cap return NO2 monitor prepay mailer . Families child live home oneweek integrated average NO2 concentration &gt; 20 ppb invite participate . We permit enrollment one eligible child per family . Using steroid medication condition asthma Chronic respiratory condition asthma Intention move relocate within 6 month</criteria>
