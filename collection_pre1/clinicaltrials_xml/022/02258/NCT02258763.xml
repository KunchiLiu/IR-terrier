	<brief_title>Trial Ideal Duration Oral Antibiotics Children With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Pneumonia single large cause death child less 5 year old preventable death . [ 1,2 ] It also important cause morbidity , especially recurrent severe may link future adult lung disease . [ 3 ] Determining aetiology pneumonia difficult child produce satisfactory sputum culture . Hence reliance molecular method like polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) Enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) look serological rise determine true aetiology pneumonia important especially era mixed infection common may associate severe infection . There currently information suitable duration antibiotic uncomplicated severe community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) . There also rampant overuse antibiotic result poor compliance significant side effect . There little information QOL child severe pneumonia parent . It important holistic approach medicine hence importance analyze burden social issue associate child admit pneumonia . As opposed adult , child produce sputum ( low respiratory sample ) appropriate culture traditional method identify causative bacteria . Identification bacteria nasopharyngeal secretion ( upper respiratory sample ) equate organism cause infection upper airway child often colonized bacteria . Detecting organism blood identifies causative organism . However , blood culture low yield child pneumonia polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) much sensitive detect bacteria blood hence markedly improve ability determine infect organism . Development in-house bacterial PCR kit detect several different bacteria blood plan study . We already in-house viral PCR kit ability detect atypical bacteria via EIA . Currently international study ( Pneumonia Etiology Research Child Health [ PERCH ] ) look aetiology pneumonia , study involve 2 Asian country ( Thailand Bangladesh ) [ 5 ] . In Malaysia , 2011 study look pneumococcal isolates antibiotic sensitivity pattern invasive pneumococcal disease [ 6 ] . There also study look viral aetiology pneumonia [ 7 ] . Hence information aetiology pneumonia skew involve vaccine associate organism use nasopharyngeal secretion ( NPS ) detect viruses.. The evidence appropriate duration antibiotic use hospitalized child pneumonia scarce . A randomized control trial compare traditional duration antibiotic ( ≥ 7 day ) versus short duration antibiotic &lt; 7 day ) think necessary . There study look duration antibiotic child severe uncomplicated pneumonia . We hypothesize need long duration antibiotic associate poor compliance unnecessary side-effects . Finally , little data quality life child parent pneumonic episode . It important measure impact common disease parent patient well assess impact medical management QOL holistic approach medicine . Two previous study look QOL . One study compare acute disease chronic disease [ 8 ] . The looked CAP without use structure questionnaire [ 9 ] Methodology Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled Trial Children age 3 month till &lt; 5 year old Admitted University Malaya Medical Centre ( UMMC ) hospital severe community acquire pneumonia Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 3 Months 59 Months Genders Eligible Study : Both Inclusion Criteria : Children admit severe pneumonia define presence follow define : - 3 month 59 month old - History cough and/or shortness breath Unwell &lt; = 7 day - Increased respiratory rate ( ≥ 50/min ≤12 month old , ≥ 40/min ) - Any follow signs/symptoms present examination would necessitate admission : chest retraction , cyanosis , saturation &lt; 92 % air , poor feed lethargy - Documented fever ( axillary /central temp ≥ 38/38.5°C ) within 24 hrs admission - Abnormal chest radio graph ( CXR ) presence alveolar infiltrate - Responds IV antibiotic first 72 hr able go home oral antibiotic i.e . hypoxia afebrile reduce respiratory symptom Exclusion Criteria : Children ( ) transfer another hospital ( b ) refuse blood taking ( c ) doctor diagnosis asthma recurrent wheeze illness ( ) diagnosis bronchiolitis i.e . wheeze child CXR consolidation ( e ) acute illness ( ie &gt; 7 day ) ( f ) unable come follow-up ( g ) community acquire pneumonia e.g . aspiration pneumonia ( h ) complicate pneumonia effusion , pneumothorax , clinical suspicion necrotizing pneumonia ( ) require paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) admission use non-invasive ventilation ( j ) significant comorbidities increase risk complicate pneumonia- ( k ) need antibiotic like anti-staph macrolides ( l ) extra-pulmonary infection e.g . meningitis ( ) allergic penicillin ( n ) unable tolerate oral antibiotic ( ) underlie illness predispose recurrent pneumonia Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled Trial Children age 3 month till &lt; 5 year old Admitted UMMC hospital severe community acquire pneumonia Informed sign consent obtain parent first . All child full blood count CXR take Additional blood urine detail also take : . Blood PCR -streptococcus pneumoniae , staphylococcus aureus , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pnuemoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae take . NPS respiratory bacteria virus ( culture PCT-similar ) All sample test hospital laboratory . If sample process immediately , store -80 deg C freezer except NPS bacterial culture . All data collect enrollment follow-up visit standardize data sheet . Baseline demographic data ( age , gender , address , ethnicity , household size , income , parent education , caregiver , household appliance ) medical information ( birth history , breastfeed weaning , growth , immunization , smoke exposure , co-morbidity , daily hospitalization information ) obtain parent medical chart . CXRs routine blood test result also record . Quality life , stress level , severity illness , parent child pneumonia , assess time point : admission ( average 3-5 day ) follow-up ( average , 4 week , 3 month ( phone call questionnaire administer ) , 6 month , 1 year post pneumonic episode ) use follow questionnaires-Paediatric proxy cough quality life-8 ( PCQOL-8 ) , Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Flu Scale ( CARIFS ) ( hospital ) , cough diary ( home , daily 1 month ) , Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 ( DASS21 ) . The PCQOL-8 DASS21 translate validated Bahasa Melayu . The CARIFS cough diary recently translate Bahasa Melayu pilot purpose study . Treatments administer least 48-72 hr intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic ( penicillin/ampicillin/ amoxicillin-clavulanate acid/cefuroxime ) patient ready discharge : afebrile , improved respiratory symptom sign , saturation &gt; 92 % air ready convert oral antibiotic . Arm 1 : Twice day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate ( 22.5mg/kg/dose ) 10 day Arm 2 : Twice day oral amoxicillin-clavulanate ( 22.5mg/kg/dose ) 3 day follow oral placebo 7 day The random treatment allocate via computer generate number sequence supervise statistician . All medication prepare dispensed pharmacy department suspension form . The appearance placebo similar active medication . Investigators subject blind . At discharge , parent ask fill daily cough diary home . Treatment failure/exit criterion fulfil follow occur : death , recrudescence fever ≥38 °C ( axilla ) respiratory sign pneumonia , hypoxaemia &lt; 92 % air ) , need antibiotic treatment , new CXR change . On discharge , child follow regular interval 4 week , 3 moth ( phone call ) , 6 month 1 year , ensure well also detect residual recur respiratory symptom i.e . presence cough/breathlessness/fever , recrudescence pneumonia respiratory illness , fever upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) , growth , need unscheduled healthcare visit respiratory symptom , need antibiotic treatment respiratory/upper airway symptom , abnormal physical finding , period 1 year post-discharge hospital . Adverse effect antibiotic e.g . vomiting , diarrhoea , rash adherence ( return empty bottle ) medication record . CXR repeat 4 week 1 year ( clinically indicate ) . These scored radiologist mask allotted treatment . At 12 month , age allows , child ask perform lung function test . During follow-ups give questionnaire : PCQOL-8 , DASS21 . At 4 week discharge , CXR well blood NPS collect test bacterial viral organism . At 4 week , daily cough diary collect back review . Sample size calculation base primary aim . We expect 20 % superiority difference extend antibiotic regime assume 20 % drop-out , sample size 204 child ( 102 arm ) . Data present accordance CONSORT guideline report RCTs . Analysis do Dr. Rafdzah , statistician . An intention treat approach use analysis . For primary aim i.e . clinical outcome different antibiotic duration , main outcome look ( ) clinical cure-complete resolution symptom sign 4 week , ( b ) proportion child without chronic respiratory symptom sign 12 month follow-up , use odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) logistic regression linear regression . For continuous variable , t-tests Mann-Whitney test use depend normality data . A Kaplan-Meier curve construct group time next respiratory illness hospitalization proportion compare regression model . For prevalence respiratory pathogen , point prevalence report multivariable logistic regression adjust baseline carriage antibiotic resistance examine effect treatment duration different organism particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Staph aureus .</detailed_description>
