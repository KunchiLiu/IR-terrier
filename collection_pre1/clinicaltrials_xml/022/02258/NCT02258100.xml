	<brief_title>Anesthesia Information System v Paper Anesthesia Records Care Congruency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesia information system ( AIMS ) increasingly use electronically capture physiologic management data anesthesia . Proponents tout improved accuracy data yet formally evaluate . Furthermore , whether AIMS associate change medical care unknown . Studies new technology demonstrate increased medical intervention result implementation . The pulmonary artery catheter show increase medical intervention use yet improvement outcome observe suggest deleterious effect . 1 Several study suggest improve patient care electronic anesthesia record . 2,3 These center around clinical decision support reminds clinician give certain medication ensure chart completion . Despite advantage study evaluate 'hawthorne effect ' AIMS . Physiologic data record data point use AIMS . This differ significantly paper anesthesia record clinician often chart physiologic trend choose omit spurious value . It possible Hawthorne effect may occur scenario increase data collection increase ability scrutinize medical record . Given litigious nature medical practice today , concern impact AIMS medicolegal liability . 4 Yet , date effect AIMS medical intervention study . We seek retrospectively evaluate paper electronic anesthesia record among single surgical population ( esophageal surgery ) ascertain difference may exist cohort regard chart completion , anesthetic management medical care .</detailed_description>
