	<brief_summary>This study examine impact soluble fibre ( polydextrose ) incorporate high fibre tomato soup food intake ( amount choice ) , appetite rating biomarkers satiation satiety 4-weeks . Specifically , impact development satiation within fixed-load tomato soup contain fibre , development satiety fixed-load meal contain fibre intake subsequent ad libitum meal examine well insulin response carbohydrate fermentation 4-week dose preload soup .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Polydextrose Containing Soup Food Intake , Appetite Biomarkers Satiation Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The science underpin short ( episodic ) long ( tonic ) term appetite regulation demonstrate food high macronutrients fibre , certain experimental condition , produce great decrease feeling hunger increase fullness , post consumption , compare equi-caloric load high carbohydrate high fat . Given fibre increase release GLP-1 , slow gastric emptying , prolongs nutrient absorption , long-term use increase generation short chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) link improved satiety responding , plausible produce strong effect within meal process satiation satiety short- long-term . Fibre also suggest influence carbohydrate fermentation ( via generation SCFAs ) improve insulin response , additionally improve satiety . Ingredients may add boost fibre content use polydextrose , non-digestible polysaccharide usually use dietary fibre food . Polydextrose also show increase level SCFAs due slow fermentation relate reduction subsequent intake and/or reduce hunger . The aim current study assess impact high fibre , polydextrose enrich tomato soup ( experimental ) low fibre tomato soup ( control ) food intake , experience appetite biomarkers satiation satiety . Sample size : 86 male age 18 55 year body mass index ( BMI ) 23.0 28.0 kg/m2 . A subset 28 participant undergo additional finger prick blood glucose hydrogen breath test measure assess biomarkers satiation satiety . Power calculation ensure sufficient participant include base power expect medium effect ( 0.25 ) 80 % power 2 condition between-measures design use G*power . Methods : Participants invite three full test day ( baseline control , session 1 ; first dosing , session 2 ; one day prior final dosing , session 3 ) session provide breakfast ( tailor individual rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) use Schofield equation ) , preload condition ( receive high fibre polydextrose enrich control tomato soup ) one hour ad-libitum lunch follow four hour later ad-libitum dinner snack box . All test day involve use standard operating proceedures . Pre-packaged portion soup provide 4-week dosing period study session 2 3 participant . A subset participant ( N=28 ) additionally undergo 3 test session ( baseline control , session 0 ; second dosing , session 3 ; final dosing , session 4 ) breakfast provide followed test product additional glucose carbohydrate fermentation measure collect 3 hour light fix portion meal . Throughout test day participant complete visual analogue scale ( VAS ) appetite palatability well questionnaires pertain eat behaviour current sensation ( include gastrointestinal distress questionnaire ) . Statistical analysis : Primary analysis comparison subsequent ad-libitum energy intake high fibre polydextrose enrich tomato soup compare control use ANOVA post-hoc test . Meal duration various appetite rating also analyse biomarkers satiety . The specified participant number ( n=86 ) give 80 % probability detect effect energy intake .</detailed_description>
