	<brief_title>Impact Gated PET/CT Diagnosis Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study directly compare standard CT scan PET/CT scan gating ( computer adjust breathing excursion ) patient advanced EOC . The primary objective study obtain definitive evidence value gate PET/CT compare current standard imaging ( CT scan ) diagnosis extra-abdominal thoracic involvement . This study give precise estimate sensitivity specificity CT compare gate PET/CT , allow calculation positive predictive value negative predictive value . The proportion patient upstaged Stage IV ( extra-abdominal involvement ) Stage III gate PET/CT calculate . Secondary objective establish : - The impact gate PET/CT image clinical management ( change plan treatment ; detection metastatic spread `` unexpected '' site ) . - The validity gate PET/CT positive ( FDG avid ) finding histological evaluation . - We also receive information `` unusual '' ( unexpected ) FDG positive metastatic lesion would normally notice CT scan . Current standard treatment patient advance EOC upfront surgery long tumour confine pelvis abdomen . Unfortunately , EOC often find distant site suspect surgery ( late ) . If surgeon prior knowledge disease distribution , surgeon would subject patient long invasive surgical procedure . Instead would refer patient upfront chemotherapy , widely accept clinical practice throughout Australia . This study aim increase diagnostic accuracy preoperative medical imaging subject large group patient advance EOC accurate management .</detailed_description>
