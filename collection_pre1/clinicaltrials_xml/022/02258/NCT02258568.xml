	<detailed_description>Overview . This four-year longitudinal project enroll total 425 woman spontaneously quit smoke pregnancy . The recruitment take place delivery hospital stay two large obstetric-gynecology hospital Cluj-Napoca , Romania . The investigator design , pre-test ( Objective 1 ) , apply , evaluate postpartum smoke relapse preventive randomize intervention among first 250 recruited woman husband ( Objective 2 ) : 125 couple intervention group 125 couple control group , compare woman 's relapse rate 6 month postpartum . The project continue enroll follow-up 175 additional woman total 300 subject intervention ( 125+175 ) ass extent postpartum smoking relapse associate risk factor prospective cohort study ( Objective 3 ) . The work plan . The first 6 month project consist preparatory phase . Objective 1 complete first 9 month project , milestone include focus group , interview woman , husband , medical staff , design intervention pre-testing acceptability . Objective 2 complete month 10-24 project . Milestones include : recruit 250 couple ( month 10-30 ) , apply intervention ( month 10-33 ) , follow-up assessment ( month 16-36 ) , preliminary analysis ( month 13-36 ) . Objective 3 complete month 19-45 project . Milestones include : recruit 175 additional woman ( month 19-39 ) , follow-up assessment ( month 25-45 ) , preliminary analysis ( month 22-45 ) . The last 12 month ( month 37-48 ) project use conclude project , include finalize database analysis , prepare final report , prepare article publication . Objective 1 : Design , pre-test , refine innovative intervention prevent smoke relapse pregnancy maximize feasibility potential impact . This objective represent qualitative developmental phase postpartum relapse intervention order tailor intervention need target population . The focus-groups interview aim qualitatively explore issue related woman 's motivation self-efficacy , two key component plan intervention . To develop postpartum smoke relapse intervention strategy Motivation Problem Solving ( MAPS ) strategy Reitzel colleague follow , new approach relapse prevention field , incorporate motivational self-efficacy component intervention , adapt local attitude preference . MAPS successful preventing relapse . The intervention base Motivational Interviewing seminal relapse prevention model , probably prominent theory smoke cessation relapse . Self-efficacy view principal causal determinant successful abstinence , among individual contextual factor , hypothesize increase . The model also specify individual need sufficiently motivate avoid relapse . Briefly , phone counseling session consist information benefit abstinence increase motivation , help woman identify manage high-risk relapse situation , therefore enhance self-efficacy . The aim deliver consistent repeat advice train professional phone postpartum period . Following new approach field , smoke husbands/partners also target brief motivational advice use birth teachable moment quit . Two psychologist train deliver phone motivational advice . Self help material also create distribute 250 woman participate trial . A randomization algorithm set assign patient intervention control group . Objective 2 : Implement evaluate intervention prevent maternal smoking relapse pregnancy randomize controlled trial setting . Participants . The aim recruit 250 pre-randomized ( 125 intervention vs. 125 control group ) mother birth quit smoke 2 month pregnancy later end 1st pregnancy trimester remain abstinent delivery , biochemically confirm expired carbon monoxide . The mother approach delivery hospital stay two large obstetrics-gynecology clinic Cluj-Napoca , Romania . Enrollment criterion include willingness ability participate study , age 18 old , marry live stable partner , mobile phone , willing provide mobile phone contact husband partner . Their husband life partner also approach invite study recruitment , present , phone first week birth . Procedures . At enrollment , 250 participant give self-help material 5-10 min brief advice offer trained research personnel consist encouragement remain quit , review smoke risk benefit abstinence . The mother intervention group additionally receive three telephone-based counseling session deliver trained professional phone 1 week , 1 month , 3 month birth . All smoke husband partner mother intervention group contact first week birth offer one phone motivational session quit support wife 's abstinence . To incentivize couple remain study appreciate time effort , gift certificate mail baby-related merchandise around 1-month 6-month follow-up contact . Outcomes . The project follows-up couple 6 month postpartum . Postpartum maternal abstinence main outcome , define maintain smoke-free status continuously 6-month follow-up . The postpartum maternal abstinence biochemically verify expired carbon monoxide ( CO ) 6-months postpartum ( CO ) &lt; 10 ppm . Secondary outcomes interest maternal number cigarette smoke , self-efficacy , motivation . The self-reported smoke status husband/partner another outcome interest . Maternal characteristic . An extended prenatal questionnaire use recruitment 6-month follow-up . Based prior literature predictor postpartum relapse , questionnaire include demographic ( age , education , ethnicity ) , health history ( prior pregnancy history , contraception use feeling pregnancy ) , mental health ( depressive symptom , stress , anxiety ) , nicotine dependence quitting , extensive section smoking knowledge attitude , substance use , breast feeding , life partner smoke ( report new mother ) . Analytical plan . The required sample ( 100 intervention vs. 100 control final follow-up ) calculate assume abstinence rate 0.3-0.4 ( 70 % 60 % relapse ) control group compare anticipate 0.5-0.6 intervention group , order attain 80 % statistical power detect difference two-tailed comparison , alpha 0.05 . Beginning 125 couple intervention vs. 125 control group enrollment , consistent prior project Romania , 20 % attrition assume final follow-up 6 month birth ( 100 vs. 100 ) . To evaluate effectiveness intervention , initially unadjusted comparison outcomes intervention vs. control group perform . Regression analysis use adjust group dissimilarity differences p-values less 0.10 . A cost-benefit analysis intervention also perform . The intervention cost compare health benefit derive increase mother abstinence rate , increase father quit rate , reduce family exposure tobacco smoke . The health benefit monetize use estimate available research literature . In addition , economic analysis present various scenario propose intervention integrate sustain exist Romanian health system . Objective 3 . Assess extent postpartum smoking relapse associate risk factor among woman spontaneously quit smoke pregnancy . Participants . To assemble large sample woman quit smoke pregnancy , 175 additional woman recruit delivery hospital stay , total 300 ( 125 Objective 2 + 175 ) woman subject intervention . For consistency , offer self-help material , brief advice , gift certificate incentive ( see Objective 2 ) . Outcomes maternal characteristic . Postpartum maternal abstinence 6 month postpartum main outcome interest . A secondary outcome interest maternal number cigarette smoke postpartum . Associations maternal characteristic describe explored ( see Objective 2 ) , particular focus mental health , nicotine dependence quitting , breast feeding , partner smoke . Analytical plan . Descriptive multivariate analysis use compare woman relapse one remain abstinent . Descriptive analysis ( count percentage ) assess extent postpartum smoking relapse explore unadjusted association various characteristic risk factor woman postpartum smoke status : abstinent vs. relapse . Multivariate logistic analysis uncover independent , adjust , effect individual interacted factor , statistically adjust effect variable include analysis .</detailed_description>
