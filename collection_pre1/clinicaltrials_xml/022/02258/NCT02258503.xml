	<brief_summary>The pain elderly even often unrecognized trivialize ignore spite big frequency : chronic pain affect 50 % elderly living home , 49 83 % living institution 80 % population end life . So elderly , noxious character pain pregnant young adult . The echo act everyday life fast , activity decrease , come deteriorate isolation dependence : echo psychic state frequent pain part cause confusional state . Finally , presence pain distorts considerably quality life modify state general desire life . The evaluation pain appeal strategy young subject specificity , related pathology associate age real age . For purpose , investigator first scale self-assessment numerical scale adapt estimate acute chronic pain scale present bias , certain patient express spontaneously pain one must attentively look case modification behavior . So scales hetero-evaluation elaborate solve difficulty detection care pain elderly . One scale Algoplus® ( 5 item allow within one minute good quality evaluation whatever place care ) whose objective observation behavioral change cause acute pain elderly communication disorder . Due demographic evolution , emergency department frequently place consultation elderly . Indeed , elderly represent approximately 10 20 % passage emergency department 50 % patient hospitalized passage reception Emergency department elderly . Elderly care difficult certain number reason ( vulnerability , accumulation pathology treatment ) . So , context , evaluation presence pain care difficult particular elderly communication disorder . In preliminary study emergency department Hospital Clermont-Ferrand , 700 patient 75 year old admit April 2012 , 32 % prescription analgesic 13 % real quotation pain . The aim investigator study analyze systematic introduction scale Algoplus® evaluation elderly entrance emergency department could modify prescription analgesic .</brief_summary>
