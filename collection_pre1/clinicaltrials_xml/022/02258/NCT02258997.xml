	<brief_summary>The investigator propose patient HbSβ-thalassemia low level hepcidin high level GDF-15 HbSS patient non-crisis , `` steady state . '' In addition , investigator propose control RBC transfusion , patient HbSβ-thalassemia high level storage iron ( base serum ferritin ) . Participants : Total number subject 42 - 21 subject HbSS , 21 subject HbSβ-thalassemia ) . Procedures ( method ) : Eligible subject document SCD ( HbSS , HbS-β 0-thalassemia HbS-β+-thalassemia ) follow University North Carolina ( UNC ) Comprehensive Sickle Cell Program evaluate single-center , prospective , cross-sectional study . The patient screen eligibility time routine sickle cell clinic visit . Patients ' data obtain person time evaluation review medical record . Investigators obtain information SCD-related clinical complication obtain estimate number lifetime RBC transfusion . Blood sample obtain laboratory test . Plasma sample hepcidin , growth differentiation factor 15 ( GDF -15 ) , high-sensitivity CRP store -80 degree Celsius analysis . Other routine laboratory study include complete blood count ( CBC ) differential reticulocyte count , serum iron profile ferritin , liver function test perform clinical laboratory UNC Hospitals.The subject 30 ml . blood drawn research study . Females child bear potential urine pregnancy test time study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) refers group inherit disorder characterize presence sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) associate episode acute illness progressive organ damage . The common variant SCD , sickle cell anemia ( HbSS ) , refers homozygosity β S allele , remain patient sickle hemoglobin C disease ( HbSC ) sickle beta thalassemia ( HbSβ-thalassemia ) . SCD may associate iron overload occur follow repeat red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . However , patient beta thalassemia major , iron overload occur due repeat RBC transfusion hyperabsorption iron . The hyperabsorption iron beta thalassemia occur due ineffective erythropoiesis subsequent downregulation hepcidin . Thalassemia intermedia major study human model hepcidin modulation ineffective erythropoiesis alone combine opposite effect ineffective erythropoiesis transfusion dependent iron overload , accordingly . Regular transfusion induce massive iron load inhibit erythropoietic drive . Accordingly , hepcidin production high thalassemia major thalassemia intermedia although still inappropriate massive transfusional iron load partially counteract erythropoietic-dependent hepcidin down-regulation ( Origa R et al , 2007 ; Kattamis A et al , 2006 ; Camberlein E et al , 2008 ) . No difference steady-state level hepcidin observe HbSS patient ( N = 40 ) compare healthy hemoglobin AA ( HbAA ) control ( N = 30 ) ( 85.3 ± 30 l μg/L vs. 83.5 ± 40 l μg/L ) ( Ezeh C et al , 2005 ) . Hepcidin 25-amino acid peptide produce mainly liver major physiological regulator body iron store serum iron . It negatively regulate egress iron cell , intestinal epithelial cell macrophage . Growth differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ) twist gastrulation protein homolog 1 ( TWSG1 ) , two transform growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) superfamily member release erythroid precursor , propose contribute hepcidin suppression thalassemia , although remains unresolved whether GDF-15 TWSG1 marker ineffective erythropoiesis mediator hepcidin suppression vivo . With presence thalassemia gene , patient HbSβ-thalassemia ( HbSβ0-thalassemia HbSβ+-thalassemia ) may increase tendency absorb excess iron compare patient HbSS .</detailed_description>
