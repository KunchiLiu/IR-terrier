	<brief_summary>There lack effective rehabilitation method visio-spatial neglect ( VSN ) . By use virtual technology , new method ( virtual reality , VR method ) create focus stimulate attention network : top scan train 3D game , combine intense visual , audio tactile bottom-up stimulation , also include visuo-motor training . Objective . To evaluate clinical functional improvement stroke patient VSN , well train new VR method Method : - An intense visio spatial scan training , enhance direct visual , audio tactile stimulation cue feedback , also include visio-motor activation design VR game . The in-house develop software base Tetris game . The VR method consist interactive 3D environment : desktop computer , monitor , 3D glass force feedback interface . 15 patient chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) visio spatial neglect include due right-sided ischemia . A VR neglect test battery include Posner task repeat three time 5 week baseline training start ( establish chronic state ) 15 hour train ( 3x1 h 5 week ) . Evaluation new method training attention stroke cause visio spatial neglect . The method design home rehabilitation well suit tele-medicine approach . It build standard component easy manufacture low cost . The idea give access effective training , make available stroke unit possibility patient loan discharge home rehabilitation . The concept one , easy-to-use device testing , train outcome evaluation beneficial These preliminare result promise indicate RehAtt™ method could become developed effective stimulate intervention tool would lower rehabilitation cost reduce tiresome travelling hospital training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Training Visio Spatial Neglect Virtual Reality Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A VR environment use training ( RehAtt ) post-stroke patient neglect . Patients play VR game three time week five week , totally 15 hour . A neglect test battery five neglect test repeat three time five week baseline estabish chronic state reduce test test learning effect , 5 week train period . The main outcome result thereafter obtain compare 5 neglect test : Star cancellation test , Baking Tray Task , Line Bisection , , Extinction Posner task - unified index SPSS Repeated Measurement ANOVA 3 baseline visit result intervention . The Catherine Bergego neglect scale use assess activity daily life intervention well six month . Patients include neglect persist six month right side ishemic stroke . Neglect diagnose one four neglect subtests VR test battery cut ( See Appendix detail ) . The exclusion criterion severe visual impairment , severe medical illness , severe depression cognitive dysfunction ( MMSE ≤ 23 point ) . All patient receive oral write information inform sign consent . The Umeå university ethic review board ( IRB ) approve study ( 2010-266-31M ) . The hardware consist standard PC , video graphic card , sound card , headphone separate numeric keyboard measure behavioural response . In VR test part , use 19 '' CRT monitor shutter glass stereoscopic vision . A 27 '' monitor 3D vision glass ( Nvidia , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) replace VR game part . A robotic pen ( Phantom omni haptic device , Sensable technology , Wilmington , USA ) use pointer use right hand assessment activity paretic leave hand play VR game intervention .</detailed_description>
