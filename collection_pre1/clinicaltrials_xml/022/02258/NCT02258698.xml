	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Surgical injury inflammation provoke stereotypical stress response . Insulin resistance play intrigue role metabolic alteration depend intensity injury . Metabolic derangement result peripheral insulin resistance unambiguously related adverse outcome higher perioperative complication rate . Therefore , insulin resistance offer act marker stress potentially relevant predict clinical outcome . Plasma-glycosylated hemoglobin A ( HbA1c ) establish indicator blood glucose control prognostic value regard outcome major surgical intervention . Adipose tissue hold key function endocrine metabolism release multiple substance , so-called adipose-derived secreted factor adipokines . Recent study link several adipokines overall insulin sensitivity metabolic syndrome-related condition well critical illness . Irisin , recently identify myokine act white adipose tissue play role prevention insulin resistance . AIMS OF THE STUDY : The aim study assess level effect perioperative insulin resistance clinical outcome cardiac surgery patient . Based previous study suggest glucose homeostasis insulin resistance associate severity illness outcome critically ill patient , propose patient mark insulin resistance suffer bad clinical outcome . This study protocol evaluate ability homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) , quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI ) , HbA1c , adipokines Angiopoietin-like protein 2 ( ANGPTL2 ) , C-X-C motif chemokine 5 ( CXCL5 ) , visfatin , myokine irisin indicate perioperative insulin resistance explore correlation adverse clinical outcome 30 day . MATERIAL &amp; METHODS : 325 patient admitted surgical intensive care unit elective on-pump cardiac surgery consecutively enrol . Baseline characteristic routine blood sample assess day surgery . Study blood sample drawn preoperatively induction bay anesthesia measure insulin resistance index HOMA QUICKI , HbA1c , ANGPTL2 , CXCL5 , visfatin , irisin . Blood glucose , irisin , adipokines , routine biochemical test assess upon admission intensive care unit postoperative day 1 3 . Adverse outcome assess 30 day surgery . Sample size set ensure least 80 % power significance level 0.05 .</brief_summary>
