	<brief_summary>The purpose study help make low cost automatic blood pressure monitor device diagnosis monitor pre-eclampsia pregnant woman , automatic blood pressure monitoring limit available . The study compare low cost device commercially available system use pre-eclamptic woman many United States hospital investigator bring Malawi part study . The team hop show low cost blood pressure machine work well help woman pre-eclampsia . The study also aim see machine easy nurse use . 20 woman either at-risk diagnosed pre-eclampsia enrol Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital . First , nurse fit test device cuff one arm subject commercially available cuff opposite arm . A trained research assistant nurse record blood pressure measurement document alarm indication make device . Blood pressure measurement continue monitor longer clinically prescribe . The result study help researcher understand performance usability device Malawi help decide design change need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Assessment Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor Diagnosis Management Pre-eclampsia Low-resource Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research team Rice University develop Sphygmo , automatic blood pressure monitor use monitoring diagnosis pre-eclampsia pregnant woman , particularly low-resource setting current blood pressure monitoring limit . This study aim evaluate capability device set design - low-resource hospital . This study compare Sphygmo device commercially available automatic blood pressure monitor use pre-eclamptic woman . The main objective study determine whether Sphygmo device correctly identify instance blood pressure measurement meet diagnostic criterion mild severe pre-eclampsia monitoring at-risk mother . Additionally , study aim understand frequency type complication associate use Sphygmo resource-limited clinical setting . The study include 20 eligible consent woman QECH clinically identify at-risk pre-eclampsia already diagnose pre-eclampsia doctor . All participant undergo protocol ( monitor Sphygmo commercially available device ) . First , nurse fit Sphygmo device cuff one arm subject commercially available device cuff opposite arm . A trained research assistant continuously hand assist nurse device setup record blood pressure measurement alarm indication make device . Blood pressure measurement Sphygmo commercially available device continue monitor longer clinically prescribe . In addition , blood pressure take via clinical ausculatory measurement stethescope aneroid gauge regular interval . This third method help u confirm accuracy two device . All clinical decision make accord commercially available device 's measurement . The key result study ability Sphygmo device identify blood pressure level correspond mild severe pre-eclampsia . Additionally , investigator document user error device malfunction . These result provide information performance ease use device also alert research team necessary change need device .</detailed_description>
