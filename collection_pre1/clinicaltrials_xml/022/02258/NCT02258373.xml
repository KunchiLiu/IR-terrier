	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Continuous Glucose Monitoring With Without Routine Blood Glucose Monitoring Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CGM offer opportunity improve glycemic control , include reduction hypoglycemia . Unlike home blood glucose monitor , CGM intend use directly make therapy adjustment adjunctive device supplement information obtain standard blood glucose monitor . However , although label CGM require BGM measurement make therapy adjustment , many CGM user often decide meal bolus base CGM alone . A study compare CGM use solely adjunctive device , per FDA labeling , versus CGM use largely lieu BGM measurement would provide valuable data . Since many individual T1D often use CGM alone bolusing insulin , obtain data safety efficacy approach important . If indeed insulin dose decision proven safe effective use CGM alone ( without BGM confirmation ) compare CGM BGM confirmation , study would also pave way new standard diabetes management protocol therapy would require eight BGM measurement ( i.e . finger stick ) day ease burden manage type 1 diabetes . For study , participant randomly assign 2:1 probability CGM Only CGM+BGM group , respectively . Prior randomization , study precede run-in period 10 week collect blind baseline CGM data , train participant CGM use , ass compliance CGM use , initiate standard CGM use . During standard CGM use run-in phase , visit occur 2 , 4 8 week , phone call 1 , 3 , 6 week . Current CGM user may eligible skip part run-in phase . Participants successfully complete run-in phase randomize . Both group use CGM device BGM . The CGM device use study Dexcom G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System modify algorithm . The CGM+BGM group instruct measure blood glucose whenever diabetes management decision make . The CGM Only group instruct measure blood glucose ( calibration ) standard BGM meter certain circumstance use blind BGM meter time standard BGM measurement do . Following randomization , phone contact first week ( 4 8 day follow randomization ) address question participant protocol . Follow visit occur 3 , 6 , 13 , 19 26 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible , participant must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes ( base investigator 's judgment ) 2 . Age &gt; =18 year 3 . T1D duration &gt; =1 4 . HbA1c &lt; =9.0 % ( local laboratory DCA2000 comparable point care device use assess eligibility ) 5 . Use insulin pump insulin delivery least 3 month , plan discontinue pump use next 8 month 6 . Participant able manage his/her diabetes respect insulin administration glucose monitoring , assess investigator screen visit 7 . Participant understands study protocol agree comply , include willingness use study CGM BGM 8 . No expectation participant move area clinical center time period study , unless move area serve another study center Individuals meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . Severe hypoglycemia last 12 month assistance another individual need seizure/loss consciousness past 3 year 2 . Significant hypoglycemia unawareness base Clarke Hypoglycemia Unawareness Survey define least one follow present : Survey score &gt; 2 Survey Q1 answer ' I longer symptom blood sugar low ' Survey Q7 response indicate symptom hypoglycemia felt glucose level &lt; 50 mg/dl Survey Q8 response never rarely question 'to extent tell symptom blood sugar low ' 3 . More one DKA event past year 4 . History seizure due hypoglycemia 5 . Current use threshold suspend pump feature ( note : participant eligible pump feature use threshold suspend active ) 6 . Myocardial infarction stroke past 6 month 7 . Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 obtain within prior 12 month part usual care kidney transplant 8 . Most recent thyroid function test result abnormal , obtained part usual care within prior 2 year 9 . The presence significant medical psychiatric disorder use medication judgment investigator affect wear sensor , completion aspect protocol , increase risk 10 . Cognitive difficulty , judgment investigator , could impair individual 's ability follow protocol increase risk 11 . Initiation noninsulin drug glucose control past 3 month , plan initiation next 8 month , discontinuation noninsulin drug glucose control past 3 month ( note : individual use noninsulin medication glucose control 3 month eligible provided expectation medication discontinue time period study participation ) 12 . Use systemic beta blocker drug 13 . Regular use oral corticosteroid 14 . Anticipated need use acetaminophen time course study 15 . Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month 16 . Currently pregnant lactate plan attempt get pregnant time period study â€¢ Females childbearing potential queried possibility pregnancy urine pregnancy test perform uncertainty possibility pregnancy . They must agree use appropriate birth control time period study . Participants receive education regard birth control method may consider highly effective , method achieve failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly include : Combined hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) Progestogenonly hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , injectable , implantable ) Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Intrauterine hormonereleasing system ( IUS ) Bilateral tubal occlusion Vasectomised partner Sexual abstinence 17 . Participation intervention study ( include psychological study ) past 6 week 18 . Known adhesive allergy 19 . From blind runin phase ( prestudy CGM use criterion meet skip blind runin phase ) , CGM value &lt; 60 mg/dl 10.0 % time 20 . Unsuccessful completion runin phase respect CGM BGM use</criteria>
