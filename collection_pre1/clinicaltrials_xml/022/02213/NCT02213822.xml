	<brief_summary>The purpose study discover genetic change associate different cancer . With information study investigator hope provide good way prevent , detect treat many cancer . Many disease result change person 's genetic material cause cell work properly . Currently , researcher doctor know genetic change cause disease , know genetic change cause disease . This project design identify genetic change cause cancer human . Specimens collect schedule diagnostic routine ( i.e . blood draw count ) procedure may include sample tissue ( surgery ) , bone marrow , blood , saliva , urine , spinal fluid , sputum , joint fluid , seminal fluid , ascites ( fluid fill abdomen ) , and/or pleural fluid ( fluid lung cavity ) , either confirm diagnosis cancer help decide best treat cancer illness . Additionally archived tissue may analyze . Samples may store future use late experiment . The Department Pathology Rhode Island Hospital store sample . Information medical record , responses treatment family history cancer , collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complex , progressive , multigenic , somatic mutation genome widely accept primary drive force evolution cancer initiation , growth , metastasis pharmacoresistance . Different type tumor associate mutation distinct set gene , press need sequencing-based method analyze panel candidate gene differ tumor type . Traditional approach sequence analysis employ capillary electrophoresis-based Sanger sequence widely use guide therapy patient lung colorectal cancer melanoma , sarcoma , leukemias lymphoma . This technology limit throughput , scalability , speed , resolution . The emerge technology next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) - hold number advantage traditional method , include ability fully sequence large number gene single test simultaneously detect deletion , insertion , copy number alteration , translocation , exome-wide base substitution know cancer-related gene . Sequencing whole genome financially prohibitive many potentially valuable application . One alternative whole genome method target enrichment , exome sequencing , capture sequence protein cod region . The exome represent 1-2 % human genome ; however contain vast majority disease cause alteration . In addition exome sequencing , full-length transcriptome ( mRNA ) sequence offer fast inexpensive alternative . It easy method identify cod sequence capture variant gene express , well generate additional information , gene expression level splice pattern . The goal study investigate genomic , transcriptomic proteomic alteration human solid cancer hematologic malignancy . Patients &gt; 18 y.o . diagnose cancer ( include solid tumor hematologic malignancy ) patient undergoing procedure diagnosis presume cancer eligible . The research analysis perform department pathology division hematology oncology . The body/blood tissue analyze extra tissue/blood need diagnosis evaluation patient 's cancer . All sample de-identified . Samples store indefinite period time sample utilize .</detailed_description>
