	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine corifollitropin alfa ( long-term gonadotropin administration ) effective control ovarian stimulation protocol oocyte donor compare daily gonadotropin administration ( recombinant FSH HP-hMG )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Corifolitropin Alfa Oocyte Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , increasingly advance developed term control ovarian stimulation protocol . These improvement also move way administration different treatment , present , subcutaneous device , possible offer advantage ability ensure administration correct dose modify dose charge . Simplification ovarian stimulation protocol help reduce physical stress donor cancellation rate . The need daily injection worsen degree compliance , generates anxiety relate administration right dose / possibility make unconsciously mistake . Innovations delivery device could help reduce stress associate stimulation improve welfare donor . Given consideration , need develop stimulation protocol reduce physical emotional burden reproduction treatment establish . Corifollitropin alfa molecule full-length recombinant FSH generating sustain effect stimulation ; single subcutaneous injection drug able replace first seven injection daily FSH preparation , finally , result would overall decrease number injection need whole cycle . Pharmacological pharmacodynamic characteristic corifollitropin alfa could facilitate design simple stimulation protocol need few resource monitor donor , include few clinic visit .</detailed_description>
