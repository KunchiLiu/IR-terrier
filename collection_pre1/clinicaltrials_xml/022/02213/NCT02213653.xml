	<brief_summary>Anemia patient cancer common problem associate impaired quality life . Treatment erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) allow increase hemoglobin level 40-70 % patient decrease transfusion requirement . Absolute functional iron deficiency also common 30 % cancer patient histology combine iron deficiency anemia . Several study show benefit combination intravenous iron erythropoiesis-stimulating agent improve hemoglobin . However , none , investigator knowledge , specifically perform population patient functional iron deficiency . In addition , clinical practice , association carry particular dosage consensus sequence administration iron associate ESAs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Evaluating Agents Stimulants Erythropoiesis ( ASE ) Associated With Ferric Carboxymaltose ( Ferinject ® ) Concomitant Sequential Patients Treated Cancer With Anemia Associated With Functional Iron Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Iron Deficiency Cancer The literature review therefore present uncertainty allow routine application intravenous iron associate ESAs . The SOR also conclude IV iron `` consider '' iron deficiency . These uncertainty heterogeneity study population , contradictory result use pattern intravenous iron bind non-standardized . The investigator focus study patient chemotherapy-induced anemia functional iron deficiency cause lack response ESA . Indeed , patient true iron deficiency seem justify routine iron supplementation . In contrast , patient without iron deficiency warrant formal way initiate treatment ( although literature contradictory ) . This study aim evaluate , patient chemotherapy-induced anemia functional iron deficiency , efficacy safety combination epoietin zeta + Iron concomitant intravenous sequential . Because data RCP ( Summary Product Characteristics ) , ease use , safety profile , ability achieve high dos iron low frequency well adherence , ferric carboxymaltose choose intravenous iron . One specialty available , Ferinject ® ( Laboratoires VIFOR Pharma ) . The erythropoiesis-stimulating agent choose study epoietin zeta . - Hepcidin iron Hepcidin peptide hormone 25 amino acid produce liver consider central regulator iron homeostasis body . It work control intestinal iron absorption iron reuse reticuloendothelial system . Hepcidin act prevent export iron enterocytes , intestinal site absorption dietary iron , macrophage , iron recycle site hemoglobin , bind ferroportin present membrane cell induce internalization degradation . Accordingly , hepcidin consider hyposidérémiante hormone . The hepcidin rate increase iron thereby limit accumulation tissue damage associate iron overload . Inversely , rate reduce hepcidin increase iron anemia need , hypoxia , pregnancy situation iron deficiency . Moreover , hepcidin strongly induce inflammation . Thus , pathological situation cancer , high level hepcidin explain well enough inflammatory anemia characterize anemia , iron retention storage protein ferritin also level reticuloendothelial system endothelial decrease intestinal iron absorption . Despite importance pathophysiology anemia inflammation fortiori iron deficiency anemia functional hepcidin measure clinical routine . There , investigator knowledge , prospective data blood level situation iron deficiency anemia cancer patient functional data change hepcidin level induce treatment intravenous iron erythropoietin .</detailed_description>
