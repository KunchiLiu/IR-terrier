	<brief_summary>It always real challenge treat sepsis critically ill patient . The mortality high 20％ patient severe sepsis 46％ septic shock develops . Early diagnosis early treatment principle . Along appropriate resuscitation , judicious thoughtful intravenous antibiotic therapy critical determinant survival sepsis septic shock give ineffective initial therapy worsen outcome . Blood culture subsequent susceptibility test gold standard microbiological diagnosis direct optimal use antibiotic . However , conventional approach usually take 5-7 day wait final report . Positive result report 30 % patient sepsis 50 60 % septic shock . Moreover , low bacteria level blood prior use antibiotic may prevent pathogen growth . Surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) novel spectroscopy technique base Raman scatter localized surface plasma resonance ( LSPR ) , result strongly enhance Raman signal derive molecule attach nanometre-sized gold ( Au ) silver ( Ag ) structure . SERS provide structural information biomedical molecule ultra-sensitive characterization single molecular level fast non-destructive manner . The clinical application SERS sepsis first help recognize pathogen well specific drug sensitivity , optimally guide initial antibiotic usage . Plasma twenty blood culture proven Gram positive , negative Candida case separately subject metabolomics profile bioinformatics analysis establish pathogen metabolite profile . The sensitivity specificity SERS metabolomics identify pathogen antibiotics-resistant strain evaluate . The investigator expect technique play crucial role modern sepsis treatment bring great impact mortality reduction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sepsis serious medical condition cause overwhelming immune response infection . Different series chemical release blood fight infection trigger systemic inflammation , also call systemic inflammatory syndrome , SIRS . Sepsis one major public health issue , characterize high cost high mortality . Epidemiological study suggest approximately 300 sepsis case per 100,000 population ; account 2 % hospital admission 30 % intensive care unit admission . Sepsis lead cause death critically ill patient . The mortality high 20％ patient severe sepsis 46％ septic shock develops . Despite recent advance sepsis treatment , include early goal-directed therapy , low-dose corticosteroid use , protective ventilation , intensive glucose control activate protein C use , sepsis still major challenge clinical physician . Early appropriate antibiotic therapy target causative pathogen always crucial successful treatment severe sepsis septic shock . However , blood culture , current standard microbiological diagnosis , ca n't provide instant information pathogen identification right begin sepsis . It usually take 5-7 day wait final report even much longer slow-growth bacteria yeast . Moreover , yield positive rate low . Only 30 % positive result report patient sepsis 50 60 % septic shock . Some microorganisms present blood small number must long time reproduce grow quantity detect . Some microorganism difficult grow special nutrient medium may need . Viruses also detect use blood culture bottle design grow bacteria . Besides , antimicrobial therapy precede two week may prevent pathogen growth . Since time initiation appropriate antimicrobial therapy strong predictor mortality , antibiotic usually start `` empirically '' ( ie . base doctor ' experience ) broad spectrum adjust accord clinical response . For lack precise data , inadequate infection control may encounter lead poor prognosis , furthermore adverse effect antibiotic organ toxicity collateral damage ( i. e. , selection drug-resistant organism unwanted development colonization infection multidrug-resistant organism ) occur . Using SERS fluorescent microscopy-based high-speed diagnosis platform clinical microbiology may help solve problem . The specific aim subproject list : 1 . To develop comprehensive protocol pretreatment complex blood sample patient sepsis preparation SERS detection . 2 . To identify causative bacteria yeast blood high-speed diagnosis platform base SERS guide initial antibiotic treatment sepsis . 3 . To examine susceptibility causative pathogen various antibiotic guide initial antibiotic treatment sepsis . 4 . To quantify bacterial count blood explore relationship load ( virulence ) pathogen clinical course , transmissibility , antibiotic resistance patient sepsis . 5 . To compile database SERS spectra clinical microbiology , include bacteria , yeast fungi common causative pathogen sepsis . The investigator expect novel technique base SERS fluorescent optical microscopy play crucial role modern sepsis treatment , bring great impact mortality reduction , cost control , also alleviate problem grow resistant train inappropriate use antibiotic .</detailed_description>
