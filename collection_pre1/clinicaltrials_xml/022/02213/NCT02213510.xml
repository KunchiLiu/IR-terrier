	<brief_title>ZIPS Study - Zip Incision aPproximation vs. Suture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZipLine Medical , Inc. develop novel , non-invasive skin closure device call `` Zip Surgical Skin Closure '' replace suture , staple glue closure skin layer surgical incision laceration repair . The device design provide closure speed superior suture , result suture-like cosmetic outcome.The ZIPS study randomize , clinical trial compare outcome procedure use Zip Surgical Skin Closure device outcomes procedures use stitch . The Zip Surgical Skin Closure investigational device currently use hospital across United States . The Zip Surgical Skin Closure non-invasive ( word , pierce skin enter wound ) device hold skin close heal occur . It adhere skin close incision use adjustable strap hold incision close . It typically worn skin 7-14 day remove peel skin . Patients randomize either Zip Surgical Skin Closure suture , addition dissolvable suture deep layer , surgical procedure cardiovascular implantable electronic device ( CIED ) i.e . pacemaker defibrillator . Both closure technique consider standard care facility experimental . However , goal experimental study see significant difference two closure method , control study environment . Since Zip Surgical Skin Closure device relatively new market , limited amount information available describe experience patient doctor use device . In study , investigator look compare Zip Surgical Skin Closure stitch method time necessary surgeon close incision , cosmetic appearance result scar , satisfaction surgeon . The investigator also monitor study group occurrence adverse ( unfavorable ) event . Patients follow total 3 month study . All study visit align standard care follow post-implantation CIED . Non-identifiable picture obtain scar follow patient surgeon complete questionnaire indicate experience satisfaction either skin closure method .</detailed_description>
