	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , Phase II study subject Human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER2 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer receive least 2 prior line anti-HER2-targeted therapy least one include Trastuzumab-containing regimen . This study post-approval commitment regulatory authority . It design primary endpoint evaluate change biomarkers associate HER family , immunomodulation , apoptosis , Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette ( ABC ) transporters pre-treatment disease progression biopsy . It hypothesize change biomarkers may modulate resistance mechanism thereby alters response subsequent chemotherapy base regimen . Therefore , addition description clinical outcome Overall response rate , Clinical benefit rate , Progression-free survival Overall survival arm , Progression-free survival next-line therapy collect summarized arm . All subject receive study treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , subject withdrawal , , follow subsequent anticancer therapy disease progression event , survival . The primary endpoint study evaluate change expression biomarkers associate HER family receptor ligands , immunomodulation , apoptosis , ABC transport pre-treatment biopsy disease progression biopsy . This study evaluate potential mechanism explore antitumor activity dual blockade provide descriptive clinical outcome subject treat Trastuzumab combination Lapatinib chemotherapy . No formal comparison treatment arm undertake .</brief_summary>

Progression least 2 line antiHER2targeted therapy metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) Documented radiological disease progression recent treatment regimen metastatic disease Most recent treatment regimen metastatic disease must include Trastuzumab chemotherapy . Note : Trastuzumab emtansine ( TDM1 ) consider acceptable prior Trastuzumab/chemotherapy regimen Agreement provide 2 tumor biopsy Prior treatment pertuzumab , Lapatinib , and/or Trastuzumab emtansine allow ; however , last treatment MBC must include Trastuzumab combination pertuzumab . Subjects radiographically stable Central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis , define radiographically stable previous 2 brain imaging scan , asymptomatic , systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 1 month eligible ; treatment prophylactic anticonvulsant permit unless list Prohibited Medications Discontinuation prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy least 3 week prior first dose investigational product require . Note : Discontinuation Trastuzumab necessary . All treatment related toxicity , except alopecia , must recover Grade 1 better ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) ; version 4.0 ) prior administration first dose study treatment . Baseline Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; =50 % measure Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) Multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) test institution 's low limit normal QT interval correct ( QTc ) &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &lt; 480 msec patient bundle branch block . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord either Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , another method , machine manual overread . For subject eligibility withdrawal , QT correction formula QTcB use . For purpose data analysis , Bazett 's formula use primary method calculate correct QT interval . The QTc base either single Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) average 3 sequential ECGs obtain within 24 hour . The QTc base single average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period .
