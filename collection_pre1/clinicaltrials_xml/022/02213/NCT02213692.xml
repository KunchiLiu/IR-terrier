However , randomize study compare difference liver resection use traditional technology harmonic Scalpel . The objective prospective randomize study compare safety efficacy liver resection use harmonic scalpel device `` crush-clamp '' technique respect blood loss , liver transection time , hepatic hilum clamping time , hospital stay postoperative complication . All patient submit liver resection randomize two group : submit liver resection use `` crush-clamp '' technique . ( group Α ) use Harmonic Scalpel device ( group Β ) . Crush-clamping Method ( group A ) : Patients submit liver resection use `` crush-clamping '' technique . Device : Liver parenchymal crush surgeon 's finger basic surgical clamp isolate small vessel biliary radical , divide suture ligation , electrocautery , vascular clip . Harmonic Scalpel ( group B ) : Patients submit liver resection use Harmonic Scalpel device.Device : liver parenchymal transection transect harmonic scalpel , small vessel biliary radical ( &lt; 3mm ) also divide harmonic scalpel . Vessels biliary radical ( ≥ 3mm ) divide suture ligation , electrocautery , vascular clip . Primary Outcome Measures : Blood loss operation [ expect average 3 hour ] operation ] [ Designated safety issue : Yes ] Postoperative complication include bile leakage , bleeding , morbidity , injure Liver function [ Time Frame : participant follow duration hospital stay , expect average 8 day ] [ Designated safety issue : Yes ] Secondary Outcome Measures : Transection time Mark cut edge finish dispose cut edge [ Designated safety issue : No ] Hepatic hilar clamping time ( Pringle 's method ) [ duration clamp hepatic hilar ] [ Designated safety issue : No ] Hospital stay [ participant follow duration hospital stay , expect average 8 day ] [ Designated safety issue : No ] Enrollment : 128 Study Start Date : June 2014 Study Completion Date : May 2015 Primary Completion Date : May 2015 ( Final data collection date primary outcome measure ) Eligibility : Genders Eligible Study : Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers : No Criteria : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age ≥18y , ≤80y ; 2 . No history liver resection radiotherapy 3 . Liver function : Child A normal prothrombin time ( &lt; 13 second ) international normalize ratio ( INR ) ( &lt; 1.15 ) ; 4 . Extent resection ≥2 segment diameter tumor ( single nodule ) ≥ 8cm cumulative diameter tumor ( multiple nodule ) ≥ 8cm ; Eligible patient stratify resection leave lobe right lobe . 5 . No tumor thrombosis main trunk right leave branch portal vein major hepatic vein . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Recurrent liver tumor ; simultaneous resection organ except gallbladder 2 . Prothrombin time &gt; 13seconds ; 3 . Blood platelet count ( BPC ) &lt; 60*109 4 . Moderate severe esophageal varix detect CT MRI 5 . Diameter portal vein &gt; 14mm ( color ultrasound )</detailed_description>
