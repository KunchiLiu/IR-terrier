	<brief_summary>The presence intracardiac thrombus propensity systemic embolism major concern patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter ( AFL ) undergo cardioversion ablation procedure . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) clinical gold standard image modality visualization right atrial appendage ( RAA ) leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) detection thrombi well risk factor associate thrombus formation , include spontaneous echo contrast low LAA velocity . However , TEE moderately invasive procedure incur additional risk , cost , patient discomfort . In addition , thrombus detection via TEE may ambiguous , another tool capable confirm uncertain TEE finding desirable . This particularly crucial case adequate LAA imaging acquire TEE clinically contraindicate , require alternative imaging modality visualize structure . Phased-array intracardiac echocardiography ( ICE ) provide high-imaging resolution routinely use atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation procedure transseptal puncture periprocedural catheter visualization . A majority imaging acquire AF ablation perform ICE catheter right atrium ( RA ) . However , standard view often unable provide sufficient visualization LAA structure due relatively long distance ICE catheter LAA . Placement ICE catheter pulmonary artery ( PA ) provide improved visualization LAA location reduce anatomic distance image catheter structure interest . Recent retrospective study confirm improved assessment LAA ICE image PA equivocal sensitivity specificity compare TEE evaluation LAA thrombus . However , study systematically evaluate presence SEC , flow velocity , LAA dimension , RAA . Although study support use ICE image PA clarify confirm TEE finding , prospective blind study evaluate LAA RAA entirety require . We hypothesize prospective blind study confirm ICE non-inferior TEE assessment LAA RAA structure detection thrombus .</brief_summary>
