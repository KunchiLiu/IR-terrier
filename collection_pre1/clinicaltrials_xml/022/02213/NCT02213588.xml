	<brief_title>Effects Plant Concentrate Blend Oxidative Stress Healthy Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate blend plant concentrate impact oxidative stress human . Biomarkers oxidative stress measure three time point 3 month intervention . Based proof concept dose response study , show plant concentrate propose dose low marker oxidative damage induce production antioxidant enzyme . We would like confirm finding evaluate implication increase antioxidative enzyme see proof concept study . An acute oxidative stress induce high glycemic drink short aerobic exercise response induction acute oxidative stress well recovery acute oxidative stress . Since induction antioxidative enzyme link protection protein lipids oxidative damage , also link protection DNA damage . Therefore , study , comet assay perform evaluate integrity DNA .</detailed_description>
