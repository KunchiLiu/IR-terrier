	<brief_title>The Effect Glucose Bone - Direct og Indirect ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Previous study show Diabetes Mellitus type I ( DMI ) II ( DMII ) associate increase risk bone fracture . Paradoxically DMII patient higher Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) average , DMI patient low BMD average . Even low BMD DMI fully explain extent fracture find . Known risk factor BMD underestimate risk fracture amongst DM patient use 10 year fracture risk tool 'Fracture Risk Assessment Tool ' ( FRAX ) . It well-known increased level biochemical bone marker predict low-energy fracture . However bone marker DM patient show heterogeneity inconsistency . Because , predictive value bone marker still uncertain DM patient . Part pathology DM high blood glucose level find non-diabetics . This high level blood glucose could potentially influence bone turnover thereby bone marker . It , however , still uncertain whether glucose per se influence fracture risk DM patient . Among young healthy individual , Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) reduce concentration resorptive formative bone marker . This reduction counteract somatostatin analogue , octreotide . Therefore effect glucose bone marker may indirect link gut hormone release . It may also cause direct effect osteocytes change chemical configuration bone marker , render undetectable standard assay . To examine , conduct preliminary vitro trial glucose added serum . This change level bone marker therefore unthinkable glucose per se affect assay cause change bone marker configuration . The effect Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test ( IVGTT ) bone marker never examine . Subcutaneous parenteral injection gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 2 ( GLP-2 ) dose-dependently reduces resorptive bone marker , parenteral GLP-2 entail change formative bone marker . This show GLP-2 uncoupled effect bone turnover , resorption inhibit , formation remain . There association bone turnover , inflammation glucose . Chronic inflammation patient inflammatory bowel disease increase bone resorption increase Receptor Activator Nuclear factor Kappa beta Ligand/Osteoprotegrin ( RANKL/OPG ) ratio , may case DMII . Human endothelial cell augment production inflammatory marker MCP-1 glucose level continuously elevate . RANKL also induce MCP-1 production human osteoclast . An vitro trial show , blood glucose level 24 mM , osteoblasts increase expression RANKL , production inflammatory marker , include MCP-1 , expression mRNA formative bone marker osteocalcin . It yet examine whether MCP-1 correlate formative resorptive bone marker vivo . It therefore still uncertain whether glucose direct effect bone turnover indirect effect via . either GLP-2 inflammatory process . Aim The aim project examine whether IVGTT reduce bone marker level degree OGTT . Also , examine whether effect glucose load direct indirect either GLP-2 inflammatory process reflect inflammatory marker . Perspective This project determine whether effect glucose bone marker direct indirect . This knowledge use explore whether glucose 'the miss link ' present fracture prediction score DM patient . Methods In project 12 healthy male subject undergo oral glucose tolerance test intra venous glucose tolerance test . During test bone marker measure different time interval compare . Using method possible distinguish whether glucose act directly bone bone marker intestinal inflammatory pathway . Subjects recruit advertising . After sign consent form , subject fill questionaire concern lifestyle ( smoking , alcohol , diet exercise ) , previous fracture familiar disposition DM , osteoporosis thyroid disease . Bloodpressure , height weight measure . Statistics Paired t-test repeat measurement analysis use statistical analysis , well linear logistical regression adjustment potential confounders .</detailed_description>
