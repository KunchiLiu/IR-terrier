	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate postoperative delirium general anesthesia regional anesthesia elderly patient undergo hip fracture surgery . Our research hypotheses : ( 1 ) regional anesthesia may contribute decrease incidence postoperative delirium . ( 2 ) Regional anesthesia may improve outcome elderly patient reduce healthcare cost associate postoperative delirium . ( 3 ) Postoperative delirium may result poor long-term functional outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Anesthesia Post-operative Delirium Elderly Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium ( POD ) acute confusional state associate change consciousness , arousal level cognitive status . Elderly patient hip fracture high incidence delirium . The high risk factor delirium include : Age 65 year old , cognitive impairment/dementia , current hip fracture , severe illness . Many previous study predict majority general anesthetic sedative agent favour postoperative delirium . However , none study investigate effect general anesthesia effect regional anesthesia general anesthesia postoperative delirium elderly patient undergo hip fracture surgery China . This multicentre , prospective , randomize control clinical trial design evaluate postoperative delirium general anesthesia regional anesthesia elderly patient undergo hip fracture surgery . Our research hypotheses : ( 1 ) regional anesthesia may contribute decrease incidence postoperative delirium . ( 2 ) Regional anesthesia may improve outcome elderly patient reduce healthcare cost associate postoperative delirium . ( 3 ) Postoperative delirium may result poor long-term functional outcome . This trial follow nine investigational center : Department Anesthesiology , The Second Affiliated Hospital &amp; Yuying Children hospital Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China ; Department Anesthesiology , Tongji Hospital , Tongji Medical college , Huazhong University Science &amp; Technology , Wuhan , China ; Department Anesthesiology , West China Hospital Sichuan University , Chengdu , China ; Department Anesthesiology , Southwest Hospital , Chongqing , China ; Department Anesthesiology , The Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School Medicine , Hangzhou , China ; Department Anesthesiology , Beijing Jishuitan Hospital , Beijing , China ; Department Anesthesiology , The First Affiliated Hospital Nanchang University , Nanchang , China ; Department Anesthesiology , The Second Hospital Anhui Medical University , Anhui , China ; The First Affiliated Hospital Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China ; Eligible patient assign two study group ( group RA : regional anesthesia use , group GA : General anesthesia use ) centre-minimization randomization ( web telephone ) . There 3 stratification factor : age ( 65-79 , ≥80 ) , presence delirium ( yes , ) , dementia ( yes , ) . There two team investigator involve trial procedure patient 's follow-up . Investigator A ( experienced anesthetist ) , competent care patient undergo hip fracture surgery , perform follow work , include informed consent , randomization , anesthesia recovery parameter . Investigator B visit patient day surgery 7days surgery discharge assess patient presence , type severity delirium , collect data hospital stay follow patient 6 12 month . Investigator B receive uniform training use CAM , Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 ( DRS-R-98 ) , MMSE test use trial ) clear protocol . Within 24 h surgery , cognitive function patient assess MMSE , presence delirium diagnose CAM , type severity delirium assess DRS-R-98 pain assess 100-mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Routine monitoring ( NBP , continuous ECG , pulse oximetry ) initiate patient . Premedication anesthesia avoid surgery . Any medication impair cognitive function recommend , administer , must record detail . Investigator A allocate patient group GA group RA accord centre-randomization unique registration number eligible patient . Treatment protocols group also stipulate sedative administrated operation . Routine monitoring initiated patient . Hypotension ( Systolic Blood Pressure &lt; 90mmHg drop Mean Arterial Pressure &gt; 30 % ) treat vasoactive agent fluid bolus deem appropriate anesthetist . Postoperative analgesia administer accord local procedure clinical trial site , aim maintain VAS pain score ≤ 30 mm . Both group receive routine postoperative care orthopedic ward . All randomize patient follow 7 day surgery ( discharge hospital ) . The 7 day follow-up include : CAM , DRS-98-R ( applicable ) , VAS , Analgesic use ( applicable ) , Sedative use ( applicable ) , Post-operative morbidity laboratory result ( include serum hemoglobin , hematocrit , leucocytes , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , albumin , serum creatinine urea concentration , serum sodium potassium serum glucose concentration ) . Concomitant medication , adverse event serious adverse event record study visit . Economic parameter include : time discharge post operation , total cost hospital cost anesthesia patient . Investigator B also assess patient POD clinic residence 6 12 month assess presence delirium , type severity ( CAM , DRS-98-R ) , cognitive function use MMSE , quality life use The MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) questionnaire . The study monitor regularly clinical research associate ( CRA ) visit telephone . CRA verify consistency data record case report form source document management therapeutic batch , presence completeness investigator file .</detailed_description>
