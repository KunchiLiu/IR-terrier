	<detailed_description>This Phase II randomize , partially-blinded , controlled trial male female , 65 year age old , good health meet eligibility criterion . This clinical trial design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine , derive influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus , manufacture Sanofi Pasteur administer intramuscularly different interval dosage ( 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 mcg HA/0.5 mL dose ) give MF59 adjuvant manufacture Novartis Vaccines Diagnostics . Subjects assign randomly 1 6 group ( 60 100 subject per group ) receive three dos intramuscularly inactivate A/H7N9 vaccine dosage ( 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 mcg HA/0.5 mL dose ) give MF59 adjuvant use two different study vaccination schedule . The first third study vaccination administer subject Day 1 approximately Day 169 . The second study vaccination administer either approximately Day 29 Groups 1 , 3 , 5 approximately Day 57 Groups 2 , 4 , 6 . Reactogenicity measure time study vaccination 8 day study vaccination occurrence solicit injection site systemic reaction . Unsolicited non-serious adverse event ( AEs ) collect time study vaccination approximately 28 day study vaccination . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition collect time first study vaccination approximately 12 month last study vaccination . Immunogenicity test include perform hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralizing ( Neut ) antibody assay serum obtain immediately prior first study vaccination ( Day 1 ) , approximately 28 day second study vaccination ( approximately Day 57 Groups 1 , 3 , 5 ; approximately Day 85 Groups 2 , 4 , 6 ) , immediately prior third study vaccination ( approximately Day 169 ) , approximately 28 day third study vaccination ( approximately Day 197 ) . Subjects Groups 1 , 3 , 5 also immunogenicity test HAI Neut antibody assay perform serum obtain approximately 56 day second study vaccination ( approximately Day 85 ) . Between 360 600 subject enrol trial . Study Duration approximately 30 month Subject Participation approximately 18 month .
