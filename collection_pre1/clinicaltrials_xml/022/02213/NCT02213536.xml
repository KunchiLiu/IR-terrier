	<brief_summary>To investigate use scalp sparing technique radiotherapy treatment design treat whole brain . Current treatment method treat whole brain radiotherapy result complete alopecia side effect . Hair loss usually patchy uneven re-growth similar slow . It hop reduce radiation dose hair bear follicle scalp reduce hair loss increase speed evenness re-growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Efficacy Hair Sparing Radiotherapy Treatment Whole Brain .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale conduct SPARE study : The purpose study evaluate effect deliver WBRT via VMAT method hair loss subsequent re-growth . Hair loss find negative impact QoL particularly stressful patient short life expectancy , already well document . Trying minimise treatment side effect , previously state literature , worthwhile investigation . This study look prescribe dose change establish , evidence base well documented prescription WBRT . SPARE observational study hair loss re-growth patient 's prescribed clinical treatment . Aims Objectives ; 1 ) To observe hair loss re-growth patient undergoing Whole Brain Radiotherapy use Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy method delivery . As complete alopecia expect 100 % patient receive conventionally deliver WBRT consider positive result complete hair loss happen use VMAT group patient . Assessment hair loss re-growth . The assessment hair loss subsequent re-growth conduct use objective subjective assessment : 1 . Objective assessment : Photographic 2 . Subjective assessment : Patient interview \ completion hair record sheet . Photographic assessment : Initial baseline photograph take radiotherapy treatment deliver day one treatment schedule . Four photograph total head , two lateral ( leave right side ) , top ( superior ) back ( posterior ) . Subsequent serial photograph take two week , one , two , three , four month radiotherapy treatment . Subjective assessment : Patients ask give opinion hair loss \ gain record hair record form complete member study team . This conducted time interval scalp photograph take . Scalp photo also assess 2 independent member research team score use scale participant . Subsequent follow-up scalp picture assess baseline ( day 1 ) photo complete alopecia image assess re-growth . Planning Dosimetry : Treatment plan generate use 2 arc VMAT technique generate Varian 's Eclipse treatment planning system use 10 MV photon deliver Varian Clinac equip Millennium Multileaf Collimator . Plans optimized select maximum dose rate 600 MU/min .</detailed_description>
