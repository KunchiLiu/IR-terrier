	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Globally , stroke rank second lead cause death third large cause disease burden . Stroke associate tremendous physical , psychological economical demand patient , family , health care system society large . The worldwide burden stroke expect increase come year . In developed country , trend primarily consequence grow old population ; age major risk factor stroke . Upper limb paresis one frequent persist impairment follow stroke , represent major obstacle regain independence activity daily live ( ADL ) . In fact , estimate 50 % stroke survivor leave non-functional arm complete stroke rehabilitation . In order minimize disease burden stroke survivor , great importance design implement effective rehabilitation strategy target paretic upper limb . Studies show recovery upper limb functioning ( i.e . recovery impairment activity limitation , include skill ) follow pattern pronounce early post-stroke recovery subsequent leveling already 6 month post-stroke . In fact , show 80 % patient reach plateau within 3 week , 95 % reach plateau 9 week . It also show regain hand dexterity largely define within first 4 week stroke , indicate critical time window recovery upper limb functioning . Therefore rehabilitation effort early post-stroke phase likely decisive maximize functional recovery . However , despite fact recovery likely immediate week stroke , study investigate effect therapeutic intervention time period . Several therapeutic intervention currently use try aid recovery upper limb functioning . There limited evidence hands-on therapy , include passive joint mobilization , manual stretch soft tissue passive exercise , effective . Strength train chronic stroke may reduce motor impairment patient mild-moderate paresis , without effect ADL-performance . Likewise , limit evidence use mirror therapy , sensorimotor mental training . The evidence use orthoses support device inconclusive . Repetitive task-oriented practice , probably wide use intervention facilitate upper limb recovery stroke , demonstrate promising result mostly chronic stroke deliver use virtual reality system robot , well constrained-induced movement therapy . However , approach patient resource demand term hour daily train expensive technology . Moreover , remain unknown functional benefit persist long-term . Electrical stimulation ( ES ) another method use facilitating recovery upper limb function follow stroke . ES induce muscle contraction , somatosensory stimulation motor threshold . Regardless type stimulation , evidence ES aid reduce motor impairment , question regard optimal stimulation protocol ( e.g . current amplitude , pulse frequency , placement electrode , treatment duration ) , long-term effect transfer training effect ADL remain unanswered . Since body evidence primarily base upon study conduct ES chronic stroke patient , also remain unknown extent ES apply acute phase stroke could affect recovery upper limb functioning . Although vast majority study focus ES induces muscle contraction , widely accept somatosensory input require maintain normal motor function . Research show motor skill acquisition motor performance dependent somatosensory input , stroke patient intact somatosensory function experience satisfactory response rehabilitation . In healthy person , application electrical somatosensory stimulation ( ESS ) peripheral hand nerve , forearm muscle whole hand elicits increase cortical excitability representation control stimulate body part , increase cortical excitability seem outlast stimulation period . It hypothesize increase amount somatosensory input may enhance motor recovery patient follow stroke . Recent study acute , subacute mostly chronic stroke patient suggest single 2 hours-session ESS peripheral hand nerve lead transient improvement pinch force , movement kinematics upper limb motor skill require ADL-performance . The high current amplitude , prominent effect seem . ESS use conjunction motor train one study . One study demonstrate effect single session ESS maintain 30 day cessation intervention . Interestingly , emerge evidence multiple session ESS peripheral hand nerve conjunction motor training might improve motor skill paretic upper limb subacute chronic stroke patient , positive result seem outlast intervention period . When ESS deliver multiple session , unclear current amplitude optimal subacute stroke patient . ESS whole hand use glove electrode may may benefit motor recovery paretic upper limb chronic stroke patient . Importantly , ESS passive nature , cause patient minimal discomfort , adverse effect , relatively cheap easily incorporate regular practice . Therefore valuable establish effect multiple session ESS restoration upper limb function acute phase stroke . 2 . Purpose project The overall aim present study investigate effect multiple session suprasensory ESS conjunction occupational therapy ( OT ) /physiotherapy ( PT ) training recovery upper limb function acute stroke patient . Suprasensory ESS define high current amplitude elicits paresthesia absence discomfort , pain visible muscle twitch . Specifically , wish address follow : 1 . Does continuous , suprasensory ESS conjunction OT/PT training : ) reduce impairment , b ) improve motor skill require ADL-performance , c ) reduce disability , 2 . Are change observed end intervention still present 6 month post-stroke ? ( long-term effect ) 3 . Hypotheses We expect continuous , suprasensory ESS effective intermittent , suprasensory ESS . The total time electrical stimulation single , intermittent ESS session 1 minute correspond 1/60 electrical stimulation time single , continuous ESS session . Furthermore , expect brain reorganisation proceed covariate recovery . 4 . Methods 4.1 . Study participants The trial subject recruit patient admit stroke unit Bispebjerg Hospital , Copenhagen , Denmark . The stroke unit consist acute unit rehabilitation unit , serve well-defined urban catchment area population approximately 400,000 citizen . 4.2 . Procedure , include recruitment study participant All patient consecutively admit rehabilitation stroke unit screened inclusion exclusion criterion immediately admission . Emma Ghaziani , daily project leader , health care personnel involve study ( e.g . person deliver ESS ) take personal contact eligible patient soon patient 's medical condition allows . The patient first ask he/she interested receive information study . If , write information hand , information interview schedule , patient inform possibility companion ( e.g . relative , friend ) present information interview . If necessary , patient may get assistance contact companion regard . The information interview perform Emma Ghaziani health care personnel involve study take place patient 's bedside . The patient 's bed screen rest ward visitor present . The declaration consent collect patient give reflection time determine regard inclusion criterion ) ( i.e . ESS initiate within 7 day post-stroke ) . Baseline assessment perform first week post-stroke . Using stratified random sample procedure , study participant first divide homogenous subgroup respect : ) ability perform active finger extension b ) gender . Active finger extension show simple reliable early predictor recovery upper limb function stroke patient . The patient subgroup randomly assign either continuous intermittent group . The therapist provide OT/PT training therapist perform assessment blind group allocation . The study participant blind hypothesis type suprasensory ESS effective .</detailed_description>
