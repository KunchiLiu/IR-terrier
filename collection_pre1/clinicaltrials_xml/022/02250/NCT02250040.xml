	<brief_title>Effect Physiotherapy Protocol Gait Functional Recovery After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause morbidity mortality adult lead cause disability develop country . Its incidence approximately one million per year European Union . It produce huge social impact , mortality also high demand health social service involve disable effect thirty thousand Spanish every year . Hemiplegia common physical consequence stroke define complete paralysis upper low extremity one body side . However , consequence perceptual , cognitive , sensory communication problem consider physiotherapy treatment . Age important risk indicator stroke represent exponential increase incidence . After age 55 risk double every decade triple 80 . After rehabilitation , people suffer stroke get walk independently technical help , approximately 50-60 % continue certain degree motor impairment approximately 50 % , least part , dependent daily life activity . Therefore , gait recovery one main objective rehabilitation process stroke survivor . Regarding process rehabilitation stroke , currently , insufficient evidence conclude physical therapy approach effective promote recovery lower limb function postural control . Thus , future research focus determine effectiveness individual technique clearly describe specific treatment problem regardless approach . Furthermore , review different approach physiotherapy rehabilitation stroke , physiotherapy treatment protocol base clinical status patient find . Instead , vague general instruction give , necessary clarify , effectiveness technique . On hand , study scarcely take account special characteristic elderly population group involve pathology . This study aim address issue , since main objective identify evaluate effect protocol physiotherapy retrain walk ability stroke patient old fifty-five , compose specific , clearly define reproducible technique , base clinical functional criterion .</detailed_description>
