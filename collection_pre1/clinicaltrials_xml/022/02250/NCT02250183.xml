	<brief_summary>This study design assess efficacy MEDIHONEY® Gel Active leptospermum honey dress relative SANTYL® ointment dress time heal , bacterial growth wound , patient satisfaction , treatment cost patient partial thickness burn . The study four hypothesis : 1 . It hypothesize MEDIHONEY® Gel Active leptospermum honey result significantly faster wound heal ( i.e. , few day ) compare SANTYL® . 2 . It hypothesize MEDIHONEY® Gel Active leptospermum honey site yield significantly few positive culture Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria compare SANTYL® site . 3 . It hypothesize patient provide significantly high patient care satisfaction rating regard MEDIHONEY® Gel Active leptospermum honey site compare rating regard SANTYL® sit . 4 . It hypothesize treatment cost , across participant , significantly low MEDIHONEY® Gel Active leptospermum honey SANTYL® .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Researchers examine usefulness honey treatment variety wound . Molan outline benefit honey treatment wound , effective antibacterial activity , debriding action , anti-inflammatory component , antioxidant activity . In addition , acidity honey may improve wound heal decrease pH wound provide oxygen , ultimately help regenerate tissue . Many study demonstrate effectiveness honey 's antibacterial property . For example , antibacterial activity honey show protect multi-resistant strain bacteria include multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In fact , research suggest honey may effective antibacterial agent bacteria resistant 13 different antibiotic . Related specifically burn injury , result another study indicate honey may effective antibacterial agent treatment option burn injury infect risk infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Furthermore , unlike antibiotic use clinical care , possibility develop honey-resistant wound pathogen rare , even use high concentration honey , accord one study . Results study provide strong evidence usefulness honey 's antibacterial activity treatment wound , include burn injury . In addition antibacterial property , honey find promote wound heal patient burn injury . For example , one study compare effectiveness honey dress silver sulfadiazene ( SSD ) wind heal 78 child adult burn patient first second degree burn . According result study , patient treat honey dressing significantly low average duration healing ( day ) compare patient treat SSD . In addition , approximately half wound treat honey dressing become sterile within seven day none wound become sterile span time patient treat SSD . The author study also report 30 37 patient ( 81 % ) treat honey achieve complete recovery ( i.e. , complete heal two month post-burn injury without scar contracture ) compare 15 41 patient ( 37 % ) treat SSD . Another study Baghel colleague use similar sample find comparable result . In second study , patient treat honey dressing find heal significantly faster , sterile wound less time , good overall recovery ( i.e. , few hypertrophic scar contracture ) compare patient treat SSD . Another study compare honey SSD burn wound healing ( i.e. , improvement burn wound size re-epithelialization ) patient superficial partial thickness burn . Patients include study similar burn ( e.g. , second degree burn similar depth ) comparable burn surface area ( e.g. , right hand leave hand ) . In addition , patient study receive treatment option ; , patient 's right hand treat honey his/her leave hand treat SSD . Results study indicate average healing time significantly short body surface treat honey . Interestingly , wound treat honey find heal approximately two day faster wound treat SSD . Additionally , culture wound find six patient test positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa site treat honey compare 27 patient site treat SSD . Two additional patient test positive Escherichia coli infection wound sit treat SSD . The author study conclude honey effective treatment superficial partial thickness burn SSD . Taken together , study provide preliminary evidence honey may effective treatment option partial thickness burn , benefit faster wound heal wound sterilization . In addition , MEDIHONEY® clear FDA maintain moist environment conducive wound heal . However , study yet explore generalizability finding sample patient burn injury United States , previously cite study conduct outside United States . In addition , study thus far examined effectiveness honey wound treatment fail evaluate patient care satisfaction honey treatment option treatment cost associate use honey clinical care . These two outcome provide valuable insight appropriateness feasibility use honey everyday clinical care . Overall , information obtain study yield knowledge potential benefit product burn wound treatment compare standard care ( i.e. , SANTYL® ) .</detailed_description>
