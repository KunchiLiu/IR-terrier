	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect well stereotactic radiosurgery follow wedge resection work treat patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer locate outer , peripheral , area lung . Stereotactic radiosurgery , also know stereotactic body radiation therapy , specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Wedge resection less invasive type surgery removal tumor small amount normal tissue around . Giving stereotactic radiosurgery follow wedge resection may safe treatment option patient receive standard treatment lobectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Followed Wedge Resection Treating Patients With Early Stage Peripheral Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility wedge resection follow stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) early stage peripheral non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pathologic response rate SBRT determine pathologic examination resect tumor . II . To prospectively assess patient quality life treat SBRT wedge resection . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe location viable tumor correlate pathologic response rate radiation dose , size tumor , tumor histology . II . To correlate pathologic response rate functional imaging pre- post-treatment dual-input perfusion ( DP ) -computed tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) -CT. III . To correlate change serum level deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) pathologic response rate . OUTLINE : Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery every day 3 5 fraction ( depend size tumor proximity chest wall ) . Within 4-6 week completion stereotactic radiosurgery , patient undergo wedge resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
