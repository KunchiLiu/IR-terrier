	<brief_title>A Dose-regimen Finding Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Activity Oratecan Subjects With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist Part 1 Part 2 . Part 1 study `` 3+3 '' design define MTD Oratecan 60 evaluable subject . It conduct 2 part ; 1A test oral liquid formulation 1B test oral tablet formulation irinotecan . Part 2 enroll additional 10 subject Part 1 MTD characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , activity Oratecan dose . Irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) potent anticancer drug class camptothecins market trade name Camptosar . Irinotecan prodrug activate via carboxylesterase liver intestine active form , SN38 approximately 1000 time cytotoxic irinotecan . The investigational product ( IP ) Oratecan comprise approve drug irinotecan HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate ( HM30181 ) , novel p-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) pump inhibitor . Oratecan intend treatment irinotecan-responsive cancer . The antitumor activity Oratecan due action irinotecan . Combining HM30181 irinotecan allow intestinal absorption systemic exposure irinotecan active metabolite , SN38 , therapeutic level oral administration .</detailed_description>
