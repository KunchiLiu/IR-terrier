	<brief_title>Oral ONC201 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose single agent ONC201 orally every three week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics ONC201 . II . To assess serum biomarkers therapeutic response ONC201 . III . To assess preliminary antitumor activity ONC201 single agent advance solid tumor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive ONC201 orally ( PO ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day total 2 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>

1 All patient must measurable evaluable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion ; patient receive prior radiation therapy one measurable lesion must outside irradiated field ; lesion within irradiated field follow nontarget lesion consider evaluable ; site measurable disease within previously irradiate field 6 month must elapse completion radiation therapy entry study consider measurable Patients eligible enrollment prior investigational approve cytotoxic chemotherapy within 28 day prior first dose ( week 1 , day 1 ) ; 42 day case alkylating agent ; 28 day 5 halflives ( whichever less ; le 14 day ) case investigational approve molecularly target agent ; 14 day case radiotherapy ; number prior therapy allowable All adverse event grade = &lt; 2 relate prior therapy ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or surgery ) must resolve , except alopecia neuropathy ; patient eligible enrollment surgery prior 6 week ( minor surgical procedure skin biopsy port placement do outpatient basis require wait period ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt;

oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive consider effective study ; woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test = &lt; 72 hour prior initiate treatment ; subject must agree use double barrier contraceptive therapy duration study participation , 4 month completion ONC201 administration ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately Tumor specimen ( paraffinembedded block frozen tissue ) prior resection biopsy available sufficient perform pharmacodynamic assay ( &gt;

patient must complete prior local treatment CNS metastases &gt; 28 day prior study entry include radiotherapy surgery ; patient receive steroid CNS metastasis may participate study Prior bevacizumab treatment glioblastoma high grade glioma History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ONC201 excipients Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patient unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator Patients know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive test combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible initial firstinman trial Patient active cardiac disease include follow : Corrected QT ( QTc ) &gt; 500 msec screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( use QTc Fridericia [ F ] formula ) Angina pectoris require use antianginal medication Ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication Conduction abnormality require pacemaker Valvular disease document compromise cardiac function Symptomatic pericarditis Patient history cardiac dysfunction include follow : Myocardial infraction within last 6 month , document persistent elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) function History document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient stroke last 3 month Patients history seizure past 3 month Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption ONC201 ( uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) Patients treat hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factor ( e.g. , filgrastim [ GCSF ] , granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor [ GMCSF ] ) = &lt; 2 week prior start study drug ; erythropoietin darbepoetin therapy , initiate least 2 week prior enrollment , may continue Women pregnant breast feeding adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control ; double barrier contraceptive must use trial sex ; oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive consider effective study Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test = &lt; 72 hour prior initiate treatment Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception treatment 16 additional week stop treatment ; highly effective contraception define either : True abstinence : line prefer usual lifestyle subject ; periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago ; case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) ; female subject study , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient Use combination two follow ( a+b ) : 1 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 2 . Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Oral contraception , inject implanted hormonal method allow Fertile male , define male physiologically capable conceive offspring must use condom treatment additional 16 week stop treatment Female partner male study subject use highly effective contraception dose study agent 16 week final dose study therapy</criteria>
