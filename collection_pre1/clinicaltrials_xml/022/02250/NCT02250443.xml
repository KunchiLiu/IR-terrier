	<criteria>Written informed consent must obtain assessment perform . Patients participate CBYM338X2205 study . A patient define participate study enrol receive study medication . Able communicate well investigator , understand comply requirement study . Patients treat physician considers inappropriate continuation study , include consideration physical laboratory assessment patient screening . Patients noncompliant demonstrate serious protocol deviation previous study . Use investigational drug time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives enrollment , expect PD effect return baseline , whichever longer ; longer require local regulation . History hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical class Swallowing difficulty reason precludes adequate intake energy protein , define least 20 kcal/kg/day 0.6 g protein/kg/day determine investigator assessment . On ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale , score 4 5 Suicidal Ideation item `` yes '' Suicidal Behavior item relate suicidal behavior occur last 2 year . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study 5 halflives ( 14 week ) stop treatment . Highly effective contraception define either : 1 . Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] . 2 . Sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment . 3 . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . [ For female study subject , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient ] . 4 . Use combination two follow ( a+b a+c b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . In case use oral contraception woman stable pill minimum 3 month take study treatment . Postmenopausal females must regular menstrual bleeding least one ( 1 ) year prior initial dosing . Menopause confirm plasma FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L ( determine cut use local clinical laboratory ) screening . Female patient report surgical sterilization must procedure least six ( 6 ) month prior initial dosing . Surgical sterilization procedure support clinical documentation make available sponsor note Relevant Medical History / Current Medical Conditions section eCRF . All female patient must negative pregnancy test result screen baseline . Use oral beta agonist , oral corticosteroid , androgen androgen inhibitor ( include LHRH agonist ) , intravenous gamma globulin ( IVIG ) within previous 6 month . Shortterm corticosteroid unrelated indication , define &lt; 20 mg/d &lt; 30 day end least 60 day prior screen , acceptable . Patients know bleed disorder , treatment anticoagulant . A presence history clinically relevant ECG abnormality , include limited Long QT syndrome , ischemic change show stable least 6 month previous ECG , 2nd degree Mobitz II 3rd degree heart block . History malignancy organ system ( localize basal cell carcinoma skin ) , treat untreated , within past 5 year , regardless whether evidence local recurrence metastasis . Significant illness resolve within two ( 2 ) week prior initial dosing . A positive HIV , Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C test result . No additional exclusion may apply investigator , order ensure study population representative eligible patient .</criteria>
