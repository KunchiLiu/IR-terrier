	<criteria>Written inform consent accordance federal , local , institutional guideline Age ≥18 year Patients must tissue diagnosis follow : Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) poorly differentiate gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( GEPNET ) Poorly differentiate metastatic neuroendocrine tumor unknown primary origin Measurable disease : Any primary and/or metastatic mass reproducibly measurable one two diameter RECIST 1.1 parameter cat scan ( CT ) scan . Objective evidence tumor progression within 4 month prior study entry , define serial cat scan ( CT ) per RECIST 1.1 criterion . ( At least 20 % increase sum diameter target lesion . In addition , sum must also demonstrate absolute increase least 5 mm . The appearance one new lesion also consider progression ) . Patients must receive least one prior line chemotherapy must exhaust standardofcare treatment option . Prior radiation surgery allow . At least 3 week elapse surgery , chemotherapy , hepatic embolization/ chemoembolization radioactive isotope ( i.e . Yttrium 90 ) . In case , disease progression must document treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Concomitant octreotide treatment carcinoid syndrome allow patient whose tumor progress octreotide . Patients must stable dose octreotide two week prior enrollment must remain stable dose study . Hematological function : Total white blood cell count ( WBC ) &gt; 2,000/mm³ Absolute neutrophil ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000/mm³ Platelet &gt; 100,000mm³ Adequate hepatic function within 14 day prior C1D1 : total direct bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ; 1.0 mg/dL ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 time ULN ( 30 U/L ) . In case know ( radiological and/or biopsy document ) liver metastasis , ALT &lt; 5.0 time ULN acceptable . Adequate renal function within 7 day prior C1D1 : estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min , calculate use formula Cockcroft Gault : ( 140Age ) • Mass ( kg ) / ( 72 • creatinine mg/dL ) ; multiply 0.85 female . Blood electrolytes within follow normal limit : Bicarbonate ( total ) 1830 mEq/L Sodium 135147 mEq/L Potassium 3.55.5 mEq/L Phosphorus 1.82.3 mEq/L Magnesium 1.53.0 mEq/L Chloride 98106 mEq/L Calcium ( total ) 4.55.5 mEq/L Female patient childbearing potential must agree use dual method contraception negative serum pregnancy test screening , male patient must use effective barrier method contraception sexually active female childbearing potential . Acceptable method contraception condom contraceptive foam , oral , implantable injectable contraceptive , contraceptive patch , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicidal gel , sexual partner surgically sterilize postmenopausal . For male female patient , effective method contraception must use throughout study three month follow last dose . Patients pregnant lactating Patients follow tumor type : lung carcinoid , pheochromocytoma , paragangliomas , medullary thyroid carcinoma , tumor neuroendocrine feature list inclusion criterion Radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy anticancer therapy ≤3 week prior C1D1 Major surgery ≤3 week prior C1D1 Unstable cardiovascular function : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) NYHA Class ≥3 OR Myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 3 month Uncontrolled infection require parenteral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within one week prior first dose ; patient control infection prophylactic antibiotic permit study Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositive Known active hepatitis A , B , C infection ; know positive hepatitis C virus ( HCV RNA ) HBsAg ( HBV surface antigen ) Any underlying condition would significantly interfere absorption oral medication Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy . Asymptomatic small lesion consider active . Treated lesion may consider inactive stable least 3 month . Patient malignant cell cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) without CNS symptom may include . Serious psychiatric medical condition could interfere treatment Patients coagulation problem active bleed last month ( peptic ulcer , epistaxis , spontaneous bleed ) Patients sign gastrointestinal obstruction uncontrolled vomit diarrhea ( &gt; 3 episodes/week ) electrolyte abnormality Concurrent therapy approve investigational anticancer therapeutic agent glucocorticoid Participation investigational anticancer study within 3 week prior cycle 1 day 1</criteria>
