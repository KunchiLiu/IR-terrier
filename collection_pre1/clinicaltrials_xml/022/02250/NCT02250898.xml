	<detailed_description>Post-operative breast surgery patient may face array complication . Breast surgery include biopsy , lumpectomy , mastectomy type reconstruction ( Drackley 2012 ) .

If proven effective , myofascial massage could use inexpensive non-invasive addition current pain mobility treatment ( Cassileth 2004 ) . Specific Aims Aim A . Determine effectiveness myofascial massage specific breast/chest/shoulder area reduce self-reported pain among patient undergone mastectomy breast surgery . Aim B . Determine effectiveness myofascial massage specific breast/chest/shoulder area increase self-reported mobility affect shoulder among patient undergone mastectomy breast surgery .
