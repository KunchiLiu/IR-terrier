	<brief_summary>This phase I/II study MLN9708 prophylaxis chronic graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) patient undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . During phase I portion patient undergo sibling unrelated donor transplantation enrol arm determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . During phase II portion trial , patient enrol two separate independent cohort : ) Matched sibling transplant b ) Unrelated donor transplant . Both cohort enrol analyzed separately .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN9708 Prophylaxis Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease Patient Undergoing Allogeneic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- For potential candidate trial , recommend acute GVHD prophylaxis tacrolimus , methotrexate atorvastatin combination . However acute GVHD prophylaxis regimen discretion treat physician ( involve in-vivo ex-vivo T-cell depletion , CD34+ cell selection , post-HCT cyclophosphamide ) permit . - During phase I portion , chronic GVHD prophylaxis , four dos MLN9708 administer orally ( patient undergo either match sibling unrelated donor transplantation ) day 1 , 8 , 15 22 , start day +60 +74 post allogeneic HCT . - Dose escalation start dose level 1 carry accord standard 3+3 design . If 0 3 patient experience DLT , dose escalation proceed next high dose level , 3 patient enrol . On observe DLT , cohort expand 6 patient . Dose escalation continue great 1 6 patient experience DLT , maximum dose 4mg . If 0 3 patient experience DLT dose level 2 , consider MTD . If 2 patient experience DLT , dose escalation halt dose level expand 6 patient determine MTD . If dose level already 6 patient , enrol , consider MTD . If 2 patient experience DLT first dose level ( i.e . dose level 1 ) , patient enrol dose level -1 . No intrapatient dose escalation permit . - MTD define maximum dose level few 2 6 patient experience DLT . - The phase II portion utilize MTD MLN9708 , determine phase I portion study . In phase II , patient enrol two independent cohort match sibling match unrelated donor transplant . - During phase II portion , chronic GVHD prophylaxis , four dos MLN9708 administer orally day 1 , 8 , 15 22 , start day +60 +90 post allogeneic HCT .</detailed_description>
