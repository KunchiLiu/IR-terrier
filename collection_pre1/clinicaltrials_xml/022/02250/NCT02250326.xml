	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Nab®-Paclitaxel With CC-486 Nab®-Paclitaxel With Durvalumab , Nab®-Paclitaxel Monotherapy Second/Third-line Treatment Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study test hypothesis epigenetic modifying therapy CC-486 immunotherapy durvalumab improve anti-tumor activity nab-paclitaxel subject advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive one prior chemotherapy regimen advance disease . It assess efficacy safety nab-paclitaxel monotherapy setting . Each subject receive study therapy second- third-line treatment . Approximately 240 male female subject advance NSCLC assign one follow treatment arm ( approximately 80 subject per group ) : nab-paclitaxel /CC-486 combination therapy , nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior receive first dose Investigational Product . A permuted-block randomization method employ assign subject among treatment arm enrol simultaneously , applicable , stratify following baseline factor : ECOG performance status ( 0 versus 1 ) , gender ( male versus female ) , smoker ( yes versus ) . Treatment assignment subject nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arm conduct completely randomize fashion .</detailed_description>
