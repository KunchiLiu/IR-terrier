	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase I trial study well sargramostim cryotherapy work treat patient prostate cancer . Biological therapy , sargramostim , use substance make live organism may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Cryosurgery , also know cryotherapy , kill tumor cell freeze . Giving sargramostim cryotherapy may work well treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Immuno-Response Primary Cryotherapy Treatment Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine unknown normal immune response ( T cell B cell ) post-cryotherapy treatment prostate cancer . II . Detect alter immune response ( T cell B cell ) post-GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) response post-cryotherapy prostate cancer . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( TREATMENT ) : Patients undergo cryotherapy day 0 receive sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 . ARM II ( CONTROL ) : Patients undergo cryotherapy day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
