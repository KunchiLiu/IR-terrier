	<brief_summary>The main hypothesis study demonstrate use ConfirmMDx Prostate Cancer test previously biopsied patient improve urologist ' patient management reduce unnecessary repeat biopsy , attendant procedure cost , potential adverse event men consider repeat procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PASCUAL ( Prostate Assay Specific Clinical Utility Launch ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The result study reveal clinical utility test analyze physician ' use negative positive assay compare patient manage use SOC method without assay finding . The repeat biopsy rate 12 month study entry use primary endpoint analysis . All patient follow 24 month date previous negative biopsy evaluate extend period observation track repeat biopsy cancer detection . The primary objective study demonstrate low repeat biopsy rate use negative result ConfirmMDx Prostate Cancer practice rather current SOC . All patient tissue previous negative biopsy test assay . Only data Cases ( inform ConfirmMDx assay result ) Controls ( blind ConfirmMDx assay result ) patient negative test result use primary objective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males age 40 75 year old* underwent previous cancernegative prostate biopsy within 15 month consider repeat biopsy due persistent elevate cancerrisk factor The previous negative prostate biopsy must collect minimum 8 tissue core remain FFPE tissue core available test Minimum tissue volume criterion 20 micron prostate biopsy core tissue available ( 40 micron preferable ) The presence HGPIN ( highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ) , PIA ( proliferative inflammatory atrophy ) , glandular inflammation report first biopsy histopathology report acceptable entry . Prior diagnosis prostate cancer cellular atypia suspicious cancer ( ASAP ) previous biopsy histology report . Patients manage Active Surveillance low stage prostate cancer Men great 75 year old ( generally consider repeat biopsy ) Most recent biopsy saturation biopsy ( &gt; 24 tissue core ) . Tissue extract use transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) procedures rather standard pattern biopsy core extraction . Subjects previously test ConfirmMDx .</criteria>
