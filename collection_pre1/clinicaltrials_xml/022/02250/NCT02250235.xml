	<brief_title>Piloting Intervention Improving Treatment Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People live renal failure endure demand treatment regimen keep alive include haemodialysis , restrict diet fluid intake multiple drug treatment . These demand profound effect patient 's quality life . It surprising many find difficult manage treatment even know important patient 's survival . Restricting fluid intake ( often little 500ml per/day ) essential treatment many patient advance kidney failure receive haemodialysis , many find difficult adhere . Estimates fluid restriction non-adherence range 10-70 % . Not adhere recommend maximum fluid intake lead fluid overload , associate pulmonary oedema , cardiovascular disease premature death . Understanding help patient improve treatment adherence challenge multifaceted . A recent Cochrane Review conclude : `` For long-term treatment , simple intervention , complex one , lead improvement health outcomes. '' . The healthcare service try help patient promote patient 's role healthcare educate patient illness treatment . However , widely acknowledge education alone insufficient change patient 's behaviour . Educating patient consequence non-adherence often unsuccessful patient , become entrenched poor health care behaviour extend period time . In case , repeat exposure patient threaten health-risk information might ineffective patient likely become well rehearsed discounting information provide , behaviour patient change . The propose study design investigate novel intervention promote behaviour change show effective change behaviour public health ( e.g . unhealthy dietary intake , unsafe sun exposure , hazardous drink smoke cessation ) The intervention simple implement , require little training staff may major benefit patient NHS . The intervention base self-affirmation theory . Central body work recognition health-risk education confronts people information threatening , survival , sense self . The person 's response interpret information way reduce threat , example denigrate veracity information . In turn bias information interpret reduces ability change behaviour . The theory suggest person 's sense worth ( e.g . sense-of-self ) boost time receive threaten health-risk message , person less likely interpret information bias way , render likely accept message , increased intention change believe ( self efficacy ) , ultimately change behaviour . For example , Armitage examine adult ' reaction alcohol education material , randomise control trial compare participant self-affirmed complete experimental questionnaire participant complete control questionnaire . Self-affirmation significantly increase participant ' receptiveness message , also improve effectiveness education 29 % ( 27/92 ) few people engage hazardous drink end study self-affirmed . Until recently , behaviour change intervention method test patient group experience long-term condition like renal failure . In recent pilot study ( UKCRN Portfolio study 74185 ) , team evaluate potential self-affirmation intervention promote improve phosphate medication adherence among non-adherent patient . Interim result study highlighted key issue research necessary . Firstly , intervention know effective people low motivation inform recruitment strategy , target patient appear ( basis high serum phosphate level ) non-adherent take phosphate medication . However , despite patient sample 's high average phosphate level , majority patient group report motivate improve phosphate control . Therefore , likely many patient reason high average phosphate level , forget take medication . In group patient report low motivation take medication ( 25 % sample ) , effect self-affirmation observe . There trend patient self-affirmed , report health-risk message high quality ; great self-efficacy intention improve phosphate control ultimately serum phosphate level significantly reduce one month compare control group . It important test intervention large group patient report low motivation towards require health behaviour . The team identify another treatment ( fluid management ) renal patient must follow evaluate 93 patient ' thought manage fluid intake . The result brief study suggest large proportion patient less motivated manage fluid intake therefore , assess feasibility efficacy self-affirmation intervention would achievable treatment group . Fluid management central adherence issue address clinically important particularly difficult aspect treatment patient manage . The second issue arise first study longevity intervention . The apparent effect self-affirmation behaviour change improve phosphate control observe one month sustain three month follow-up suggest self-affirmation might require repeated intervention . An important feature new study would include repeated self-affirmations intervention group investigate . A randomised control pilot trial propose . The study aim recruit 120 patient across network dialysis unit , focus patient high average interdialytic weight gain ( IDWG ) . The trial design build upon routine education fluid management dialysis visit , compare group patient receive self-affirmation intervention boost sense-of-self ( self-affirmation arm ) control group ( control arm ) . It expect patient self-affirmation arm positive evaluation health-risk information fluid management , feel able , intend change fluid control behaviour . The appropriate method analysis include logistic regression , mixed multilevel model , relatively small sample size limit extent model undertaken . Thus aim analysis examine size observed effect design large study . The study inform extent psychological clinical factor contribute outcome use future study . As intervention target non-adherent patient ( define high IDWG level ) therefore necessarily representative patient dialysis , important establish true clinical context . Patients appear manage treatment well , base current clinical measure , might well highly motivate . However , also possible patient also experience low motivation , time , illness becomes severe , would reveal worsen adherence clinical outcome . Thus , study also aim examine psychological clinical factor associate treatment adherence non-adherence wider patient sample .</detailed_description>
