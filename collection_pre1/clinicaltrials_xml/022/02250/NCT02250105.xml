	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety ARI-3037MO 3g BID compare placebo reduce triglyceride ( TG ) level subject severe ( ≥500 mg/dL &lt; 2,000 mg/dL ) hypertriglyceridemia . Eligible patient enter 4- 6-week lead-in period ( 6-week washout subject non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [ subject may remain statins period ] , 4 week patient statin receive type lipid-lowering therapy ) , follow qualify fast TG measurement visit 2 3 , least 7 day apart . If baseline TG value &gt; 500 mg/dL &lt; 2,000 mg/dL , qualified subject randomize visit 4 enter double-blind , 12-week efficacy safety assessment phase . End-of-study lipid level assess visit 6 7 ( week 11 12 average ) . A final closeout safety assessment visit do 14 week post randomization</brief_summary>
