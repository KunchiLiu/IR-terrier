	<brief_summary>Turner syndrome genetic condition , rare , due total partial absence one X chromosome , affect 1/2500 newborn female . It combine almost constantly short stature ovarian failure infertility . Other anomaly inconstant : morphological characteristic vary intensity , associate malformation , increase risk acquire disease ... The prognosis patient reach Turner Syndrome link cardiovascular complication ( congenital heart disease , dilatation ascend aorta risk dissection rupture aneurysm ) , cause early mortality reduction life expectancy least 10 year . For reason , screen heart disease dilatation ascend aorta establish intended prevent complication associate medical treatment / surgery increase life expectancy reduce co-morbidities . On vascular level , recommendation relate monitoring diameter ascend aorta include research renal artery stenosis doppler ultrasound patient hypertensive look lymphedema . However , arterial lesion describe literature , outside aneurysm ascend aorta . These peripheral arterial lesion also life / functional prognosis patient . Ascending aorta dilation seem exclusive Turner syndrome . In addition , specific vascular lesion outside affected artery described : hepatic cirrhosis vascular depletion , lymphedema varicose vein . The prevalence venous lymphatic disease unknown . A single-center review 9 case patient follow University Hospital Strasbourg show presence vascular lesion discover incidentally assessment perform reason cardiovascular screening : cystic lymphangioma , internal carotid aneurysm , agenesis inferior vena cava , early varicose vein , embryonic cerebral artery , etc ... None patient show dilatation ascend aorta heart disease . Peripheral vascular abnormality patient group exclusive . In study , seek demonstrate arterial disease Turner syndrome involve entire arterial territory confine ascend aorta . Screening arterial lesion perform entire arterial vascular tree regularly course time , especially presence cardiovascular risk factor increase age patient . The venous lymphatic vascular damage literature series case University Hospital Strasbourg description also lead detection lesion . These vascular complication alone responsible reduction life expectancy responsible serious morbidity . Improved screening associate vascular lesion necessary enable best prevention cardiovascular complication . It also establish prevalence vascular anomaly , whether arterial , venous lymphatic , good understand disease management . By collect systematically karyotype lead diagnosis , may possible make link genetic defect heart vascular disease .</brief_summary>
