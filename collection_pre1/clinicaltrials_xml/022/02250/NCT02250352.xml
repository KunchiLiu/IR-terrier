	<brief_summary>This research trial establishes breast tumor tissue repository core biopsy . Collecting breast tissue core biopsy may allow doctor learn biology breast cancer analyze protein , gene , component tumor cell . It may also allow doctor conduct future study help understand breast cancer grow respond different type therapy . This help doctor develop good breast cancer therapy well test help make treatment decision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Core Biopsies Establishing Breast Tumor Tissue Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop baseline serial breast cancer core biopsy repository within University Southern California ( USC ) /Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Women 's Cancer Program . II . To develop maintain secure clinical database relevant demographic , clinical , pathologic longitudinal outcome characteristic sample bank . III . To efficient process distribution de-identified sample bank researcher institutional review board ( IRB ) -approved protocols exemption study breast cancer-related question . These study would include analysis tumor protein nucleic acid , serum/plasma germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) immune cell relationship baseline follow-up clinical pathological variable . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 4 cohort . COHORT I ( PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER WHO WILL UNDERGO DEFINITIVE SURGERY BEFORE ANY SYSTEMIC THERAPY ) : Patients undergo baseline , applicable , follow-up core needle biopsy breast cancer breast , regional node , distant metastasis . Patients experience recurrence progression therapy undergo additional core biopsy time recurrence . Clinical blood specimen also gather . COHORT II ( PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED BREAST CANCER WHO WILL RECEIVE STANDARD OF CARE SYSTEMIC THERAPY BEFORE SURGERY OR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED UNRESECTABLE DISEASE ) : Patients undergo core biopsy , clinical , blood sample collection Cohort I . Patients also undergo biopsy specific time point follow initiation standard systemic therapy . COHORT III ( PATIENTS BEING EVALUATED FOR A SUSPICIOUS BREAST MASS THAT HAS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CANCER ) : Patients undergo core biopsy , clinical , blood sample collection Cohort I . Patients Breast Imaging-Reporting Data System ( BIRADS ) 4b , 4c , 5 lesion may undergo 6 additional 6 core biopsy . COHORT IV ( PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER RECURRENCE OR PROGRESSION [ LOCAL , REGIONAL , OR DISTANT/METASTATIC ] ) : Patients undergo core biopsy , clinical , blood sample collection Cohort I . Patients may also undergo 1-3 extra core biopsy . After completion study , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
