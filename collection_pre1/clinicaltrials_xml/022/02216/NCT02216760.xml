	<brief_summary>The heart beat control electrical signal . Following heart attack , part heart muscle dy later replace scar tissue . Within area scar , often remain `` channel '' survive tissue still able transmit electrical signal . However , well establish `` conduction channel '' ( CC ) form short circuit around scar , lead electrical disturbance ( arrhythmia ) potentially life threatening . The common ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , estimate cause 300,000 death per year . One recognise treatment option VT involve burn ( ablation ) `` conduction channel '' ( CC ) within scar . However , present , procedure long far 100 % effective . Consequently , current best practice rely treat VT , rather prevent cause sudden death - achieve Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) , device recognise patient VT deliver internal shock restore normal electrical conduction . Patients defibrillator subsequently subject recurrent painful debilitate shock , although lifesaving , significantly reduce quality life . The limitation ablation present due difficulty visualise CC 's . Investigators Imperial College create novel electrogram visualisation program , Ripple Mapping ( RM ) , already find superior currently use programme case arrhythmias upper chamber heart ( atrium ) . During retrospective study patient scar relate VT follow heart attack , ablation deliver area associate identified Ripple Mapping Conduction Channels , patient remain free VT recurrence &gt; 2 year follow interval . The study hypothesis Ripple Mapping identify conduction channel within scar tissue critical VT circuit , ablation lead long-term freedom VT ICD therapy . The investigator aim perform prospective randomise study compare Ripple Mapping guide VT ablation conventional VT ablation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patient previous heart attack , scar form left ventricle ( bottom chamber heart ) consist dead tissue mixed strand live tissue form `` conduction channel '' ( CC 's ) . These Conduction channel cause dangerous heart rhythms Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT ) . This lead symptoms shortness breath , dizziness , blackout , , , sudden death . Patients risk sudden death receive special implanted device call implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) present recurrent painful debilitate ICD therapy consist internal shock . Patients experience frequent ICD shock due recurrent VT usually undergo procedure burn ( ablate ) area scar within heart think source VT . This involve catheter ( plastic tube ) insert heart via groin vessel allow cardiac electrophysiologists obtain information scar . Scar tissue low electrical voltage . By measure electrical voltage tissue heart , area scar well area live , healthy tissue identify map . By burn ( ablation ) abnormal channel live tissue within scar ( conduction channel ) , effectively reduce episode VT patient experience , thereby reduce frequency shock experience improve quality life . In one patient , 1 conduction channel hence source VT find . Current mapping technology incapable provide electrophysiologists information require locate conduction channel . Therefore ablation strategy shift ablate single location scar , extensive ablation within scar hope ALL conduction channel burn . However , extensive ablation strategy globally agree consensus several technique use worldwide . The disadvantage extensive ablation strategy potential region responsible VT large , require extensive ablation therefore prolong procedure time sick patient unable tolerate lengthy procedure . In current state , VT ablation strategy technically challenging time consume procedural time long 8 hour . In addition , although acute procedural success range 77 % 95 % , recurrence rate remain high - 50 % . Therefore , identification ALL conduction channel within scar desirable goal catheter ablation therapy VT. Ripple Mapping ( RM ) novel map program allow simultaneous display `` voltage '' `` activation '' data underlie ventricular tissue . RM therefore potential display detail information functional property underlie scar include interspersed live tissue channel . Investigators Imperial College demonstrate proof concept RM validate program series abnormal heart rhythm arise within upper heart chamber ( atrium ) RM find superior diagnostic yield well aid operator reach diagnosis shorter time compare conventional mapping system . The Investigators subsequently perform retrospective analysis 21 patient undergoing post infarct VT ablation . All documented location conceal entrainment perfect pace match induce clinical VT coincide Ripple Mapping Conduction Channels ( RMCC ) . In patient ablation lesion overlap identify RMCCs , patient remain free VT recurrence &gt; 2 year follow interval . The Investigators therefore propose study hypothesis Ripple Mapping identify conduction channel within scar tissue critical VT circuit , ablation lead long-term freedom VT ICD therapy . This determined via prospective randomise study compare Ripple Mapping guide VT ablation conventional VT ablation .</detailed_description>
