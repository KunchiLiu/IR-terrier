SAMPLE SIZE AND RANDOMISATION We exclude study low-volume facility record book few 10 HIV-positive antenatal mother per annum . We randomly select facility two study district either study arm . Based estimate infant retention rate control intervention arm , calculate minimum sample size 10 HIV-positive mother enrol health facility . DATA COLLECTION , ANALYSIS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The study utilize exist health information system ( e.g . antenatal care ( ANC ) Register , Exposed Infant Follow-Up Register , Anti-retroviral treatment ( ART ) Register ) , supplement EPAZ study-related data collection patient track system .
