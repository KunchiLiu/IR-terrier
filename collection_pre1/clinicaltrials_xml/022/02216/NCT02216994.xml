	<brief_summary>1 . The investigator previously report simple diagnostic scoring system differentiate Hirschsprung disease ( HD ) Hirschsprung disease ally disorder ( HAD ) patient suspect intestinal dysganglionosis . In retrospective study , investigator conclude patient predict score 5 likely diagnose HD , whereas score less 5 mostly indicative HAD . 2 . Since essential confirm accuracy efficacy score system prospective manner use standard procedure , prospective study design perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Scoring System Improves Diagnostic Accuracy Intestinal Dysganglionosis -- Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Patients hard firm stool 2 less per week , age newborn 3 year old recruit study . 2 . The recruited patient undergo preoperative work-up include barium enema ( BE ) , anorectal manometry ( ARM ) histochemical acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) stain rectal mucosa . Known risk factor intestinal dysganglionosis ( IDs ) record . The predict score calculate sum score risk factor 3 preoperative test . 3 . The patient predict score 5 diagnosed HD , perform surgery remove aganglionic bowel . 4 . The patient score less 5 mostly indicative HAD , receive conservative therapy include colonic irrigation , enema , high dose lactulose , oral paraffin oil least 6 month . When clinical improvement , patient consent surgical procedure remove dysganglionic bowel segment .</detailed_description>
