	<brief_summary>The primary objective study validate propose claim OxiCable device , pulse rate saturation accuracy diverse subject population specify saturation range .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Acute Hypoxia Study - Abbreviated Sensor Line</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general procedure invasive control hypoxia clinical study directly compare test pulse oximeter measurement saturation measurement make multi-wavelength CO-oximeter take arterial blood sample healthy human subject . Following arterial cannulation , hypoxia induce reduce percent inspire oxygen subject breathe simultaneous measurement record test pulse oximeter arterial blood sample target level saturation .</detailed_description>
