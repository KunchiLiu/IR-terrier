	<brief_summary>Gastrectomy curative treatment early gastric cancer ( EGC ) . Recently , endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) accept standard treatment select patient negligible risk lymph node metastasis . However , limited data regard long-term outcome ESD comparison surgery . This protocol aim compare overall survival rate , tumor recurrence , development metachronous cancer ESD surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence gastric cancer high Asia , especially Korea Japan . In Korea , detection rate EGC increase mass screen prevention gastric cancer-related death . EGC define mucosal submucosal cancer , regardless regional lymph node metastasis . The presence lymph node metastasis report range 2 % 18 % . For reason , radical gastrectomy lymph node dissection consider curative treatment . In EGC patient , surgical outcome demonstrate excellent 5-year survival rate 90 % . In 2000 , EGC subgroups negligible risk lymph node metastasis propose basis large scale retrospective data . Thereafter , result adopt expanded criterion endoscopic resection EGC . ESD useful technique dissect tumor along submucosal layer use various endoscopic knife . Compared endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) , ESD achieve high complete resection rate lower local tumor recurrence rate . Although curative resection pathologically achieve ESD , post-resection surveillance need confirm presence nodal metastasis . Recently , several study report 5-year overall disease-specific survival rate highly favorable EGC patient underwent curative ESD . However , comparative study long-term outcome ESD gastrectomy . Therefore , protocol aim evaluate overall survival rate , tumor recurrence , development metachronous cancer ESD surgery group .</detailed_description>
