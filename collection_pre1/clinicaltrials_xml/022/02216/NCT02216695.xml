	<brief_summary>The true population incidence acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , previously call acute renal failure , England know . A good understanding epidemiology AKI national level essential inform initiative prevent AKI well reduce associate morbidity mortality . The purpose study combine national database hospital discharge national census data investigate trend incidence , AKI require dialysis AKI require dialysis , well associate mortality determinant England 1998 2013</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology Acute Kidney Injury England - 1998 2013</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject Selection Withdrawal We identify case AKI use validated International Classification Diseases , Tenth Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM ) cod diagnosis code , keep objective study . Patients follow code include : N17.0 acute renal failure tubular necrosis , N17.1 acute renal failure acute cortical necrosis , N17.2 acute renal failure medullary necrosis , N17.8 acute renal failure N17.9 acute renal failure , unspecified . Acute renal failure replace new terminology , acute kidney injury , due lack ICD-10-CM code AKI , use ICD-10-CM code acute renal failure henceforth , refer AKI protocol . Subject Recruitment Screening We extract 1998 2013 data Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) , data warehouse contain detail admission , outpatient appointment A &amp; E attendances National Health Service ( NHS ) hospital England . HES collect detailed record 'episode ' admit patient care deliver England , either NHS hospital , primary care trust , mental health trust deliver independent sector commission NHS . These data collect patient 's time hospital store large collection separate record , one period care , secure data warehouse . We extract secondary diagnosis code 14 diagnosis available till 2006-07 20 additional diagnosis 2007 till 2013 . In addition demographic data , also extract 15 procedure code . To identify AKI patient require dialysis , include procedure code X40.3 hemodialysis X40.4 hemofiltration 15 procedure . To exclude patient chronic kidney disease start dialysis , exclude patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 5 ( N18.5 ) end stage renal disease ( N18.6 ) procedure cod arteriovenous fistula ( L74.2 ) arteriovenous shunt ( L74.3 ) inpatient admission ( figure 1 ) . This algorithm show sensitive specific , high positive negative predictive value ( &gt; 90 % . Patients admit , discharge study period include study . We obtain data patient demographic , hospital characteristic , in-hospital mortality , disposition , length stay ( LOS ) , 20 diagnosis 15 procedure code base ICD-10-CM Office Population Censuses Surveys Classification Surgical Operations Procedures , 4th revision ( OPCS-4 ) HES database . To obtain population incidence AKI require dialysis , obtain mid-year population England year 1998 2013 Office National Statistics ( ONS ) . We also obtain length stay mortality patient acute kidney injury cod N17 diagnosis code , England time period . Patients contact . This study obtain informed consent patient ' work anonymous patient data . No screening requirement ( laboratory diagnostic testing ) necessary meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Unique Subject Identification number already allocate patient HES database include patient 's name hospital number . Sample Size Determination The data HES extract period April 1998 March 2013 . HES data collect patient ' time hospital submit allow hospital pay care deliver . As retrospective population cohort study use national database , case AKI define inclusion criterion , HES database use . Statistical Methods All analyse perform use validated statistical software . Data 15-year period divide three 5-yr period ( April 1988 March 2003 , April 2003 March 2008 April 2008 March 2013 ) also present individual year . Age categorize group &lt; 65 , 65-74 , 75-84 &gt; 85 . Charlson score great 5 group one category . Method admission define one elective admission ; emergency admission ; maternity admission ; admission unknown . Ethnicity group White , Mixed , Asian , Black , ethnic group ethnicity stated/unknown . Continuous variable express mean 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Categorical variable express proportion compare chi square test . Incidence rate per 1000 person-years 95 % confidence interval calculate use Poisson regression analysis compare use chi-squared test proportion . Age-adjusted incidence rate AKI calculate base UK standard population use direct standardization method . Further analysis do identify regional variation epidemiology AKI require dialysis AKI require dialysis England . The Poisson regression model use analyse effect gender , age group , period admission , method admission , Charlson co-morbidity index ethnicity incidence AKI . Cox Proportional Hazard Models apply test association mortality variable . Multivariable logistic regression consider assess association AKI variables simultaneously . We use middle period 2003-2008 reference , enable u evaluate improvement mortality compare 1998-2003 also evaluate whether improvement sustain later period 2008-2013 . The effect AKI mortality length stay test use Cox Proportional Hazard Models Linear Regression respectively . Long-term survival patient plot use Kaplan Meir curve obtain date cause death patient obtain Office National Statistics . We randomly select number patient record diagnosis AKI HES database since 1998 . Controls also select matched patient age , sex , date diagnosis region . The association AKI exposure analyze use conditional logistic regression . Data Handling Record Keeping The data obtain HES anonymised patient identifiable characteristic . The study protocol , documentation , data information generate hold strict confidence . No information concern study data release unauthorized third party , without prior write approval sponsor institution . Authorized representative sponsor institution may inspect document record , require maintain , Investigator , include limited , medical record ( office , clinic hospital ) subject study . The clinical study site permit access record . Information study subject keep confidential manage accord requirement Data Protection Act , NHS Caldicott Guardian , The Research Governance Framework Health Social Care , Ethics Committee Approval Trust IM &amp; T Policy . The Chief/Principal Investigator `` Custodian '' data Source Documents The source document HES database . HES data hold financial year data-sets , although source data collect monthly NHS - originate commission message send healthcare provider healthcare commissioner via secondary User Services ( SUS ) . At pre-arranged date year , SUS take extract database send HES . HES validate clean extract , derive new item make information available data warehouse . Data quality report check complete various stage clean processing cycle . Records Retention The data keep 15 year completion study , accordance requirement Therapeutic Goods Administration Health Privacy Principals . All research data study related document store , follow end study . The data secure password-protected computer access chief investigator . The data delete hard drive computer end archival period . Study Monitoring , Auditing , Inspecting The investigator permit study-related monitoring , audits inspection Ethics Committee , Sponsor Research Governance Manager .
