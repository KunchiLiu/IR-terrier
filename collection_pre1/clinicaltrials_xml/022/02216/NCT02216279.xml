	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension elevation pressure pulmonary vessel , result various clinical condition . It may idiopathic ( unknown cause ) associate numerous disease include cardiovascular lung disorder . Affected individual suffer progressive shortness breath , sever form ; pulmonary hypertension carry bad prognosis many type cancer . There test currently easily non-invasively detect abnormality pulmonary circulation . Presently cure pulmonary hypertension substantial research effort dedicate development new drug stop progression well yet , reverse disease process . The investigator know drug currently commercialize pulmonary hypertension directly improve status pulmonary vessel since test currently provide information . Direct early detection lung vessel abnormality associate pulmonary hypertension use sensitive non-invasive test would allow earlier test new drug , would provide much good surrogate disease severity allow efficient pre-clinical drug testing . The aim phase II study evaluate safety PulmoBind participant pulmonary hypertension potential detect abnormal pulmonary circulation associate within pulmonary hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase-II Study Use PulmoBind Molecular Imaging Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently one radiopharmaceutical agent approve Canada ( world ) clinical image pulmonary circulation , metastable isotope 99 technetium . This agent exclusively use diagnosis physical defect circulation due pulmonary embolus . There imperative need new lung tracer provide great safety profile enable functional well anatomical image pulmonary circulation . A novel adrenomedullin derivative develop , molecular image pulmonary circulation . PulmoBind label metastable isotope 99 technetium , commonly use image isotope clinical nuclear medicine . PulmoBind adrenomedullin derivative specifically design bind adrenomedullin receptor avoid hemodynamic effect . This novel tracer potential help diagnosis follow-up various disorder pulmonary circulation currently alternative . In PulmoBind I three escalate dos administer safety assess . The product well tolerated safety concern . Imaging reveal predominant lung uptake .</detailed_description>
