	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicentre , 4-arm randomise phase II trial fulvestrant + AZD2014 versus fulvestrant + everolimus versus fulvestrant alone patient ER-positive , HER2-negative advance metastatic breast cancer , whose disease relapse treatment ( within 12 month discontinuation ) AI adjuvant setting progress treatment AI metastatic setting . Patients randomise ( 2:3:3:2 ) one four treatment arm : - Fulvestrant - Fulvestrant + AZD2014 ( continuous daily schedule ) - Fulvestrant + AZD2014 ( intermittent schedule - 2 day , 5 day ) - Fulvestrant + everolimus Randomization stratify follow criterion : - Measurable disease ( vs. non-measurable ) . - Sensitivity prior endocrine therapy ( sensitive versus resistant ) Sensitivity prior endocrine therapy define ( ) least 24 month endocrine therapy recurrence adjuvant setting ( ii ) complete partial response prior metastatic endocrine treatment , ( iii ) stabilization least 24 week endocrine therapy advance disease . Treatment continue disease progression unless evidence unacceptable toxicity patient request withdraw study . If one treatment ( fulvestrant mTOR inhibitor ) discontinue prior disease progression , patient continue single agent treatment progression , evidence unacceptable toxicity patient request withdraw study . At time documented disease progression ( use RECIST 1.1 ) , patient randomise receive fulvestrant + everolimus still meet eligibility criterion may permit receive open-label crossover treatment fulvestrant + AZD2014 . Crossover therapy must begin later 28 day clinic visit progression determine . Patients receive crossover therapy progression , intolerable toxicity , elective withdrawal study , completion termination study , whichever occur first . Tumour evaluation perform initiation treatment , every 8 week first 40 week every 12 week thereafter disease progression . The study also assess relationship anticipate anti-tumour activity treatment regimen biological characteristic patient ' tumour baseline</detailed_description>
