	<brief_title>Regeneration Liver : Portal Vein Embolization Versus Radiofrequency Assisted Ligation Liver Hypertrophy ( REBIRTH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver resection remain gold standard treatment patient liver tumour provide chance long-term survival . In 45 % case amenable surgical resection , extend hepatectomy ( removal part liver ) usually necessary achieve clear resection margin . However , must enough liver leave behind meet demand body . Indeed , liver failure due insufficient remnant liver volume still principal cause postoperative death follow major liver resection . The liver receive main blood supply two vessel ( portal vein hepatic artery ) . In order decrease complication improve safety extensive liver surgery patient insufficient future liver remnant volume ( FLRV ) , pre-operative embolization ( i.e . blockage ) part portal vein undertaken . This effect induce growth liver unaffected side . Thus , resection carry , increase FLRV ( around 12 % ) reduce post-operative liver failure . An alternative technique perform surgical ligation portal vein along split liver . The diseased portion liver leave body 7-10 day healthy side induce grow . During time , diseased portion continue support body 's requirement liver function reduces risk liver failure . FLRV show increase around 74 % technique . However , postoperative complication alternative technique bile leak . The aim study test new way split liver increase FLRV achieve without increase complication rate .</detailed_description>
