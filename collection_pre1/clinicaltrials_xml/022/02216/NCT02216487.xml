	<brief_summary>As approach improve efficacy provide clinical benefit cancer patient undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment regimen , Alchemia Oncology develop novel mean deliver anti-cancer agent tumour . The drug delivery platform base use hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , novel excipient , , formulation HA result optimisation cytotoxic drug uptake retention within solid tumour . In specific example HA-Irinotecan , new formulation irinotecan demonstrate enhanced efficacy nonclinical early clinical study . The current study investigation use HA-Irinotecan Phase II single arm trial FOLF ( HA ) iri plus cetuximab irinotecan-naïve second line patient KRAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer . The study objective confirm safety efficacy FOLF ( HA ) iri plus cetuximab second-line therapy irinotecan-naïve metastatic colorectal cancer patient . It expect study recruit approximately 40-50 patient 1 year subsequent treatment follow ; thus trial run approximately 2-3 year .</brief_summary>
