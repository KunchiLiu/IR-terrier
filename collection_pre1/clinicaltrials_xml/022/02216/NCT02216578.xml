	<brief_summary>The study multi-center , multi-national , open label , single arm Phase II study single-agent cabozantinib . The objective study assess safety activity cabozantinib patient metastatic GIST previously progress imatinib sunitinib expose yet KIT- PDGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Patient receive cabozantinib experience benefit treatment , become intolerant drug wish discontinue treatment . Treatment beyond RECIST 1.1 progression allow patient derive clinical benefit upon investigator 's discretion , provide criterion treatment withdrawal meet .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis GIST metastatic . Patients primary tumor still place exclude trial , due risk intestinal perforation report cabozantinib . Presence least one nonpreviously irradiate , measurable metastatic lesion define RECIST 1.1 . Archival tumor tissue available primary tumor metastatic site ( 10 unstained slide archive tumor tissue 10 micrometer thickness two hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) stain slide ) central mutational analysis ; Note : slide prefer material available block accept Failure prior therapy Interval prior TKI therapy first dose cabozantinib least 14 day Radiological progression imatinib neoadjuvant , adjuvant palliative treatment GIST within 3 month complete adjuvant treatment imatinib AND radiological progression sunitinib treatment advanced GIST Note : progression assess local radiologist/oncologist without central confirmation prebaseline progression . Agreement patient allow sequential sample circulate cellfree DNA central mutational analysis mandatory . Male female patient ≥ 18 year age ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status ( PS ) 01 Adequate bone marrow organ function define follow laboratory value assess within ≤ 14 day prior receive first dose study treatment : ANC ( Absolute Count Neutrophils ) ≥ 1.5 x 10exp9/L ( prophylactic administration GCSF ( Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ) GM ( Granulocyte Macrophage ) CSF allow ) .

Recovery baseline ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v.4.0 toxicity relate prior treatment , unless AE ( ) clinically non significant and/or stable supportive therapy ; Prior surgery : Minor surgery ( include uncomplicated tooth extraction ) within 28 day first dose study treatment complete wound heal least 10 day first dose study treatment permit . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior first dose study treatment . Note : woman childbearing potential define premenopausal female capable become pregnant ( ie , female evidence menses past 12 month , exception prior hysterectomy ) . However , woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , low body weight , ovarian suppression reason . Patients childbearing / reproductive potential use adequate birth control measure , define investigator , study treatment period least 4 month last study treatment . A highly effective method birth control define method result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Before patient registration , write informed consent must give accord ICH ( International Conference Harmonisation ) /GCP ( Good clinical Practice ) , national/local regulation . evidence tumor invade gastrointestinal tract ( esophagus , stomach , small large bowel , rectum anus ) within 28 day prior first dose cabozantinib . current evidence endotracheal endobronchial tumor within 28 day first dose cabozantinib . radiographic presence cavitating pulmonary lesion within 28 day prior first dose cabozantinib . patient tumor contact , invade encase major blood vessel prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment advanced GIST . investigational agent within 28 day first dose study treatment ; specific contraindication treatment cabozantinib ( e.g . know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate cabozantinib ) . poorly control hypertension define baseline blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 150/90 mmHg . cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack pulmonary embolism past 6 month . gastrointestinal disorder associate high risk perforation fistula formation within 28 day first dose study treatment , include follow : Known intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade gastrointestinal mucosa . Active peptic ulcer disease . Inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis . Malabsorption syndrome . One follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding . Abdominal fistula . Gastrointestinal perforation . Bowel obstruction . Gastric outlet obstruction . Intraabdominal abscess ( complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even abscess occur 6 month first dose study treatment ) . disorder associate high risk fistula formation include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy ; evidence significant active bleeding ( include GI bleeding ) bleeding diathesis within 6 month first dose study treatment . hemoptysis ≥ 0.5 teaspoon ( 2.5 ml ) red blood within 3 month first dose study treatment . sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 month first dose study treatment . Note : patient prior history hemoptysis associate metastatic disease must bronchoscopy rule endobronchial lesion . A patient endobronchial tumor lesion eligible study . Prior surgery : prior major surgery trauma within 12 week prior first dose study drug and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture ulcer . Complete wound heal major surgery must occur 1 month first dose study treatment . Patients clinically relevant ongoing complication prior surgery ; Following clinically significant disorder : active infection require systemic treatment within 28 day first dose study treatment ; history organ transplant ; concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism thyroid dysfunction within 7 day first dose study treatment . history malignancy past 5 year exception treat carcinoma situ cervix nonmetastatic , nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients desmoid fibromatosis neurofibroma , associate GIST , allow enter trial , provision measurable GIST lesion distinguish lesion .
