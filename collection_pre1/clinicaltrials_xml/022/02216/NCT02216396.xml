	<brief_summary>One third population , age 65 , live die dementia . Half people dementia experience symptom agitation every month . Symptoms agitation include restlessness , pacing , shout verbal physical aggression . Many people agitation admit care home family find care home . Within care home , staff also often find manage people agitation difficult react wide range way . Agitated behaviour take staff time emotional physical energy always know respond . This study one stream integrate programme help tackle agitation variety setting domestic environment end life . Our primary hypothesis people dementia live care home , pay carer use dysfunctional coping strategy predict low quality life resident dementia high level agitation . We recruit 60-80 care home ( residential nursing home ) . We identify resident dementia , care home manager approach family carers . After obtain informed consent , advice personal nominated consultees lack capacity , ask people dementia answer question quality life use DEMQOL . We also ask staff family carers , rate quality life person dementia use DEMQOLproxy . We ask care home staff question resident dementia , include agitation , use Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ) , care receive . Staff also answer question way cope care stress , use COPE . We measure quality life agitation 5 time 16 month . We use result test theory agitation important factor determine resident quality life , way staff cope stress affect impact agitation quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Naturalistic Two-year Cohort Study Agitation Quality Life Care Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research question What relationship pay carer coping , agitation quality life people dementia live care home ? What economic implication ? What carer , resident environmental characteristic predict good quality life group , therefore incorporate draft care home intervention evaluate ? Do agitation , quality life quality care predict death ? Primary hypothesis For people dementia live care home , pay carer use dysfunctional coping strategy predict low quality life resident dementia high level agitation . Methods Setting sample We recruit care home across England . Our sample frame encompass care home type people dementia reside ensure external validity generalisability . We recruit home ensure representation provider type ( voluntary , state private ) care provision ( nursing , residential ) urban/suburban rural location . We already carry research : Jewish Care , Dementia UK , Camden Adult Social Care , Springdene Care Homes group , BUPA Care Homes , Care UK Abbey Care . We also work DeNDRoN ENRICH project ( CC involve North Thames pilot ) project care home partner ( Jewish Care , BUPA Barchester ) recruit care home . We discuss DeNDRoN ENRICH ; network 389 research-ready care home grow rapidly ; target achievable target large home include collaborator ; BUPA , Jewish Care Barchester . There around 18,000 English care home 80 % resident dementia ( Alzheimer 's Society ) . Procedures We seek care home manager ' agreement care home 's inclusion . We note refusal , order consider external validity use predictor sensitivity analysis . In included home , identify home care staff people care dementia use carer proxy measure , Noticeable Problems Checklist ( Levin 1989 ) know dementia diagnosis . We rather screen resident use cognitive measure , cause distress independent culture education . We invite people dementia participate . Some able give inform consent take part , majority unlikely capacity . We follow Mental Capacity Act ( 2005 ) provision decide whether include people dementia capacity , appoint professional consultees without personal consultee previous study ( Jones et al . 2012 ) . We also interview consent primary family carer resident include , see relative least monthly , consent care team member , provide hands-on care . This understand coping strategy use care impact resident . We ask pay carer work closely resident dementia complete proxy measure . For home record care home characteristic , include number resident ( total dementia ) , staff : resident ratio , turnover detail regular home activity . All assessment take place care home private room , pay carers resident ; family carers may choose interview care home , home UCL . Measures Clinical research assistant conduct interview baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 &amp; 16 month . Analysis We test hypothesis pay care team use dysfunctional coping strategy , associate people dementia bad subsequent quality life ( measure use pay carer DEMQOL ) agitation level higher . We take account influence agitation predefined carer resident environmental characteristic ( e.g . specialist dementia home ; nursing staff ; dementia severity ; resident sex age ) . Hierarchical multiple regression model use allow repeated measurement quality life time cluster carer team . Interaction term include model consider differential effect baseline agitation level . We conduct cost-consequences analysis , report different cop strategy mean per patient resource use cost , agitation quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) measure DEMQoL . The net monetary benefit , calculate mean per patient cost QALYs multiply amount decision maker willing pay QALY . Analysis also report cop strategy . Descriptive statistic mean per patient cost resource use agitation also include follow predefined Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) . We obtain date cause death ONS mortality data set ; Health Social Care Information Centre obtain data u match NHS number date birth database . Sample size calculation In START study correlation dysfunctional coping quality life -0.31 . To detect magnitude correlation 90 % power &amp; 5 % significance require 105 people dementia ( Machin et al . 2009 ) . Adjustments allow cluster care team ( estimate average team size : 40 people dementia ; Intra cluster correlation ( ICC : 0.075 ) ( Fossey et al . 2006 ) , impact confounding ( Variance Inflation Factor = 2 ) [ 8 ] &amp; expect average 2.5 repeat measurements/person ( base 30 % drop out/year ) correlation repeat quality life measurement 0.75 ( START data ) result total required sample size 700 . To investigate interaction cop strategy high low agitation group inflate sample size 2800 . This sample size reduce cluster size less 40 people dementia ; 1734 people dementia base 87 cluster 20 people dementia per cluster , 2000 people dementia base 80 cluster 25 per cluster , 2537 people dementia base 72 cluster 35 per cluster . Although powered show outcome investigate response family carers people dementia sensitivity analysis .</detailed_description>
