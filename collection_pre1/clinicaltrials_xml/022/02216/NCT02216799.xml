	<brief_summary>Hyperglycemia increase risk complication surgical patient . Focus poor glycemic control contributor adverse outcome setting outside intensive care unit ( ICU ) often dismiss . Total parenteral Nutrition ( TPN ) use provide surgical patient nutrition prevent deterioration nutritional status . However , many diabetic patient receive TPN develop exaggerate hyperglycemia require frequent insulin administration via slide scale . Providing diabetic patient 's receive TPN basal insulin know strategy aid blood sugar control prevention high blood sugar spike . Many strategy basal insulin provision utilize clinically administration TPN ; include incorporation insulin TPN solution administration long act insulin glargine . However , study compare strategy aim select optimum modality control blood glucose diabetic surgical patient 's receiving TPN . We conduct study compare efficacy daily insulin glargine versus continuous regular insulin incorporate TPN control blood glucose non-critically ill diabetic surgical patient receive TPN .</brief_summary>
