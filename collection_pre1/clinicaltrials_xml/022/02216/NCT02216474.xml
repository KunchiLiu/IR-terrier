	<brief_summary>Brain stimulation movement disorder This trial explore effect gentle electrical stimulation brain patient movement disorder . Other study already carry show brain stimulation may help improve mental ability symptoms condition depression stroke . The investigator show whether method help symptoms memory concentration problem patient movement disorder mild moderate problem mental ability . The investigator also look effect brain stimulation movement symptom mood . These people compare healthy people help u understand whether brain stimulation work differently healthy people people brain disorder . This trial carry one centre Birmingham . It schedule begin September 2014 last five year . As study commences fund Birmingham Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust University Birmingham . The investigator plan recruit maximum 200 individual study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The procedure involve surgery hair removal . We simply put small amount electrode gel head hold two electrode top head short period time ( 15-20 minute ) generate small electrical current . It quite common participant feel tingle itch near electrode apply , , usually wear within minute . Previous research show method occasionally lead mild side-effects ( e.g . headache , nausea , fatigue , exacerbation scalp skin condition ) . However , know harmful long term effect . The positive benefit brain stimulation include improve function brain short stimulation session , way may help thing like memory problem . Some people may notice change , improvement may still detect use test complex mental skill include memory task . It also possible mood symptom ( e.g . depressive thought ) could improve . The study explore possibility . Looking whether brain stimulation help health symptom help u develop new treatment . This trial include patient two different movement disorder : Tourette syndrome Huntington 's disease . In condition , change deep within brain knock effect high brain area important complex mental ability , well brain area involve movement control . Participants male female adult ( age 18-65 ) . Patients either Tourette syndrome ( diagnose accord current medical criterion ) Huntington 's disease ( diagnose genetic test ) . Patients ( ) sign additional medical condition . Healthy control ( compare patient ) current significant medical psychiatric diagnosis , history drug use brain injury . There least two separate appointment attend study center . We first assess mental ability ( e.g . memory , attention ) interview current mood medical symptom . Brain stimulation give slightly different area outer part brain , near top front head , patient group . You may ask take part trial no-treatment placebo condition , procedure feel similar real brain stimulation , real brain stimulation take place . If receive placebo condition also receive real stimulation , know condition . This mean effect expectation less likely influence result . After brain stimulation take measure mental ability , compare measure take brain stimulation , show whether brain stimulation great effect mental ability expect chance . You may ask complete simple task ( e.g . remember number ) brain stimulation , suggest could make effect stimulation effective improve mental skill . As trial continue , participant invite repeated session stimulation day ( e.g . three appointment three day row ) look whether could make effect last longer . We record effect brain stimulation participant 's mental skill , movement symptom mood , well side effect . We collect data symptom health condition order look relationship factor effect brain stimulation . Finally , may ask brain scan straight receive brain stimulation , look change brain activity .</detailed_description>
