	<brief_summary>Head neck cancer sixth common cancer 650,000 new case diagnose year worldwide . About 60 % HNSCC patient present unresectable locally advanced disease diagnosis treat multimodality approach . Despite approach , majority ( 70 % ) patient develop local or/and regional recurrence . Additional 10 % patient present distant metastasis diagnosis . Most patient recurrent metastatic disease treat single agent chemotherapy , combination chemotherapy target therapy . Despite public health magnitude , HNSCC Asian country receive limited attention drug development cancer-related research . In fact , HNSCC rank 7th among men 10th among woman incidence China , large producer consumer tobacco alcohol . Recently , Chen et al . document 1:1:2 subset distribution cancer oral cavity , pharynx , larynx China , similar distribution report Korea quite different general distribution 5:2:3 white . Ethnic disparity HNSCC also include prognosis partly explain HPV-active disease ratio genetic factor . Therefore , strong need additional research patient HNSCC Asia . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) often over-expressed , related poor prognosis patient HNSCC . The association EGFR-activated signaling pathway tumor cell survival well document many study . EGFR target strategy show clinical anti-tumor efficacy patient HNSCC , especially monoclonal antibody , cetuximab . In Extreme study , show addition cetuximab platinum-5-FU significantly prolong median overall survival 7.4 month 10.1 month compare platinum-5FU alone first-line set . HM781-36B irreversible pan-HER inhibitor . In preclinical study , HM781-36B much low IC50 value gefitinib cell line engineer express EGFRvIII mutation produce tumor growth inhibition gefitinib-resistant xenograft . A phase I trial HM781-36B patient advance solid tumor show clinically significant anti-tumor activity phase II trial HM781-36B patient non-small cell lung cancer advance gastric cancer currently ongoing . We suggest phase II trial HM781-36B patient recurrent metastatic HNSCC resistant ineligible/intolerant platinum-based chemotherapy . The aim current trial evaluate antitumor efficacy safety profile HM781-36B identify biomarker predict tumor response HM781-36B .</brief_summary>

ECOG PS 01 Documented progressive disease platinumbased ( either cisplatin carboplatin ) concurrent chemoradiation include induction chemotherapy curative aim Documented progressive disease platinumbased ( either cisplatin carboplatin ) chemotherapy palliative aim Ineligible platinumbased ( either cisplatin carboplatin ) chemotherapy chemoradiation due decline renal function patient 's intolerance 4 . At least one bidimensionally measurable disease define RECIST ver 1.1 5 . Adequate organ function treatment Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000cells/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100000 cells/mm3 Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institution upper limit normal Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( 5.0xULN hepatic metastasis ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( 5.0xULN hepatic metastasis ) 6 . The patient provide sign informed consent amenable compliance protocol schedule test 1 . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma 2 . Patients subject local treatment ( surgery radiation ) 3 . Previous treatment small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( Cetuximab permit ) 4 . Three previous systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy 5 . Any major operation irradiation within 4 week baseline disease assessment 6 . Patients receive prior systemic chemotherapy , immunotherapy study drug within 4 week 7 . Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may impair intake absorption study drug 8 . Patients uncontrolled CNS metastatic involvement . However , patient metastatic CNS tumor may participate study patient clinically stable receive steroid therapy 1 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) state study drug . 9 . Patients know interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) present ILD screen chest Xray 10 . Congenital long QT syndrome screening correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470msec 11 . Patients uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease ( AMI within 12 month , Unstable angina within 6 month , NYHA Class III , IV Congestive heart failure leave ventricular ejection fraction local institutional low limit normal 45 % , Congenital long QT syndrome , Any significant ventricular arrhythmia , Any uncontrolled second third degree heart block , Uncontrolled hypertension ) 12 . Previous concurrent malignancy except basal squamous cell skin cancer and/or situ carcinoma cervix , solid tumor treat curatively without evidence recurrence least 3 year prior study entry . 13 . Pregnant breastfeed woman 14 . Other severe acute chronic medical condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry trial .</criteria>
