Recently , demonstrate rapid intravenous rehydration ( within 4 6 hour ) severely malnourished child dehydrate cholera replace appropriate amount fluid find safe . We feel rapid rehydration would help improve renal function , acidosis thus improve appetite reduce ORS failure subsequently . Since study uncontrolled , plan randomise control study adequate sample 250 participant ; 125 rehydrated slowly ( 10 12 hour ) follow WHO guideline 125 patient rehydrated intravenous fluid 6 hour . Children either gender , age 6 60 month , severely malnourish ( Wt length &lt; -3 Z score WHO growth chart nutritional oedema ) history watery &lt; 24 hour sign severe dehydration attend ICDDRB Dhaka hospital ask participate study . After parents'/Legal guardian 's consent , child transfer study ward treat accord protocol . All child receive similar treatment except mode rehydration , different two group .
