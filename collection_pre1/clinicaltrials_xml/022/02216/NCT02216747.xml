	<detailed_description>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome child common chronic glomerular disease . The first line therapy prednisone 90 % patient response treatment . The course disease characterize recurrent relapse repeat prednisone therapy . While prednisone dose therapy duration disease diagnosis base multiple prospective study , dose therapy duration relapse never challenge prospective control study . To address question design prospective 3 arm study evaluate effective exception steroid regiment treat relapse versus low dos . The study population child age 2-18 year old steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome . After relapse diagnose base physical exam urine test , patient randomize receive prednisone dose 60/m2 45/ m2 30/ m2 . A measurement time obtain remission , duration remission est . collect . We plan recruit 100 child study .</detailed_description>
