	<brief_title>Evaluation Tolerance Afatinib Combination With Docetaxel Cisplatin LAHNSCC Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancers upper aerodigestive tract correspond Western country 5 % cancer . They treat surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy . Although progress radio chemotherapy reduce mortality increase rate organ preservation patient locally advanced head neck cancer , metastatic risk particularly high local recurrence . The induction chemotherapy first-line treatment cancer patient receive dos chemotherapy allow obtain significant reduction tumor size , thus avoid surgery treat tumor radiotherapy alone combine certain drug . The standard treatment induction chemotherapy currently use carcinoma aerodigestive tract TPF compose 3 drug : docetaxel ( Taxotere® , T ) , cisplatin ( P ) 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU , F ) . Despite relative efficacy treatment , provide survival benefit , necessary find combination induction effective less toxic . That study intend check new combination call TPA fluorouracil ( F ) replace afatinib ( A ) , beneficial . The afatinib powerful irreversible inhibitor EGFR ( human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor type 1 ) , HER2 HER 4 . The EGFR associate pejorative prognosis resistance treatment role proliferation ( multiplication tumoral cell ) , cell survival replication angiogenesis ( process growth new blood-vessels , vital growth malignant tumor ) . Afatinib prove effective patient local recurrence metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck first line cisplatin base tolerance correct . The rational study base follow element : - Cisplatin docetaxel one hand afatinib hand prove effectiveness head neck cancer . The tolerance association know . - In addition , several broad randomize trial show possible improve effectiveness induction chemotherapy locally advanced head neck carcinoma addition Taxotere® cisplatin-5FU . - Independently , show carcinoma upper aerodigestive tract recurrence metastatic , anti-EGFR targeted therapy cetuximab could improve effectiveness chemotherapy cisplatin-5FU More recently , Taxotere® Cisplatin + Cetuximab ( Erbitux® ) combination treatment head neck squamous cell carcinoma test broad study phase II show good feasibility combination particularly high rate tumoral response . - Finally comparative study cetuximab versus afatinib show advantage term tumoral response support afatinib . From observation , investigator hypothesize addition afatinib docetaxel cisplatin could induction treatment locally advance carcinoma innovate promising . Indeed , regimen appear optimized term efficiency , incorporate combination active cytotoxic agent , Taxotere® cisplatin , also potentially effective Erbitux® . The purpose study determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) afatinib administrate combination docetaxel ( Taxotere® ) cisplatin induction chemotherapy locally advanced head neck carcinoma order move phase II , allow comparison standard induction chemotherapy TPF . It multicentric , national , open , not-randomized phase Ib . Three dose afatinib ( 20 , 30 40 Mg per day ) study combination fix standard dos docetaxel cisplatin . For dose level , begin small ( 20 Mg per day afatinib ) , 3 6 patient treated maximum , i.e . 3 cycle three week treatment one ( 9 week whole ) . The next dose level study previous dose well tolerated period first 4 week observation treatment ( 1st cycle first week 2nd cycle ) . Once MTD determine , four additional patient treat dose . A maximum 22 patient include study . The total duration study estimate 18 month . In case major safety problem , study may stop early . In short , preclinical data , pharmacological clinical afatinib indicate benefit-risk ratio regard positive association afatinib cisplatin docetaxel could effective patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma potentially result extension time progression .</detailed_description>
