	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Adipose Derived Stem Cells Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In context propose study , adipose derived stem cell ( ASC ) constitute autologous cell product deliver patient via intra-venous injection . In study , propose investigate immunosuppressive potential non-manipulated non-cultured stromal vascular fraction obtain via liposuction . Endpoints measure improvement force evacuation volume one second ( FEV1 ) distance cover 6 minute walk distance test ( 6MWD ) . The stromal vascular fraction comprise stromal cell isolated total fat via enzymatic digestion ex-vivo . These cell culture isolated adipose tissue use sterile tissue process two hour . The process include rinse saline solution remove red blood cell , drain , enzymatic digestion ( collagenase ) isolate endothelial cell adipose tissue . Post-processing , pellet obtain via centrifugation filter delivered patient remain sedate within ambulatory center .</detailed_description>
