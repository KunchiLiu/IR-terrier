Part 1 study involve screen approximately 60 participant , estimate eligibility rate 67 % Part 2 . In Part 2 , participant assign one two group ( active cognitive training control training ; 20 participant per group ) complete 12 training session 10 week . Participants assign active cognitive training group complete computerize module design enhance work memory , assign attention-matched control group complete inactive module design enhance memory . All Part 2 participant complete assessment baseline post-training evaluate impact train program .</detailed_description>
