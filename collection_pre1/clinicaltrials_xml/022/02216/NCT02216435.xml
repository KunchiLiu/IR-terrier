	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) movement disorder cause either uncontrolled movement , slowness movement , slowness initiation movement rigidity muscle . One method ease PD symptom FDA-approved method Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) patient longer get effective treatment best available medication . The location brain electrode place DBS surgery PD call Subthalamic Nucleus STN . During placement DBS electrode , patient awake ask motor task determine correct placement STN proper function DBS electrode . This study aim investigate another location brain , Substantia nigra par reticulata SNr , normal placement DBS electrode . This location also know involved motor control muscle may involve process initiation movement occur . The path brain STN use DBS surgery go SNr currently , test SNr perform . We conduct simple well document visual motor test document patient 's stimulus perception motor intention rest neural stimulation SNr .</detailed_description>
