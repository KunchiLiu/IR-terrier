	<brief_title>A Study To Assess Effects Of PF-04457845 On BOLD fMRI In Subjects With Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group design study male female subject moderate-to-severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder age 18 60 year old . During study , dose 4 mg PF-04457845 administer morning Days 1-7 . On Each subject undergo rest state fMRI ( pre post day 8 ) , fearful vs. neutral face fMRI task fear extinction fMRI paradigm . The Emotional Faces Paradigm rest state task perform Day 1 ( prior drug placebo ) Day 8 . Acquisition fear conditioning perform first image session Day 1 . After first imaging session Day 1 , subject complete behavioral rating scale dose . Approximately six hour dose subject re-enter scanner perform fear extinction paradigm . On Day 2 , subject perform fear extinction memory retention task within scanner . Further physiological monitoring , include skin conductance heart rate , take place fear extinction paradigm . One safety follow-up visit occur Days 11-18 .</detailed_description>
