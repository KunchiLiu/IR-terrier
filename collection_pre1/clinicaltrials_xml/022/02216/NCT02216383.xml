In UK , two medicine commonly use purpose Syntocinon Syntometrine . Both mimic natural hormone . Syntometrine longer act , publish review trial compare two medicine conclude Syntometrine well prevent severe blood loss . Syntometrine associated side effect include nausea , vomit , high blood pressure , link rare , fatal , case stroke . All guideline therefore recommend Syntocinon prevent PPH .

No study directly compare three medicine compare overall cost ; information vital NHS . METHOD Investigators propose trial 6285 woman 13 month , four maternity unit South-West compare effectiveness , side effect cost Syntocinon , Syntometrine Carbetocin , woman vaginal birth . Women randomly allocate receive one drug . Women staff know drug receive , influence result collect . Staff collect data number extra drug treatment need volume blood lose . Women ask complete side effect questionnaire . Investigators perform analysis cost effectiveness result available . AIMS Investigators aim establish whether Carbetocin effective affordable alternative Syntocinon Syntometrine , whether few side effect new mother . Publication result , regardless find , could potentially improve birth experience woman across UK , support health service spend money effectively .</brief_summary>
