	<brief_summary>Randomized placebo-controlled interventional trial investigate effect oral magnesium supplementation intracellular magnesium subject chronic kidney disease . We hypothesize oral magnesium supplementation increase intracellular magnesium subject chronic kidney disease well increase serum magnesium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality independent traditional cardiovascular risk factor due increase vascular calcification . Epidemiological experimental data suggest hypermagnesemia magnesium supplementation reduce vascular calcification chronic kidney disease increase calcium/phosphate solubility serum , inhibit calcium influx vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) , inhibit intracellular pro-calcification enzyme VSMC increase activity intracellular anti-calcification enzyme VSMC . A trial investigate effect oral magnesium supplementation vascular calcification subject CKD currently plan , prior initiate trial necessary determine dose oral magnesium need increase intracellular magnesium serum magnesium .</detailed_description>
