	<brief_summary>This Phase I multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study DTP348 . DTP 348 oral dual drug two mechanisms action : 1. carbonic anhydrase IX inhibitor acidifies intracellular pH sulfamide component 2. radio sensitizer hypoxic cell 5-nitroimidazole moiety The study conduct 2 part . The phase I trials standard 3+3 design first single agent combine radiotherapy : 1 . A single agent dose-escalation phase patient solid tumour . 2 . A dose-escalation phase patient HNSCC combination radiotherapy The main objective determine recommend phase II dose DTP348 combination radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Determine Optimal Phase II Dose Oral Dual CAIX Inhibitor/ Radiosensitizer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In single agent Phase I dose-escalation phase patient enrol assign dose level cohort . The start dose 750 mg/m2 , equal 1/10 human equivalent dose LD10 DTP348 mouse . A `` 3+3 '' dose-escalation design use . The study investigate sequential cohort consist 3-6 patient enrol treated applicable dose level . Planned dose level subsequent cohort 1000 , 1250 mg/m2 step 250 mg/m2 thereafter . There intra-patient dose escalation . The treatment cycle dose-escalation part study consist 7 week ( reflect typical duration course radiotherapy ) . Patients receive continuous oral dose DTP348 7 day per week . Food intake allow one hour intake study drug . After cycle treatment , patient follow disease progression . Blood sample pharmacokinetic property ( PK ) obtain day 1 first 8 hour oral administration daily day 2 , 3 , 4 5 , administration daily dosage . A patient stay treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , discontinuation reason . The dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observation period dose level day 1 end week 7 . Patients complete DLT observation period reason DLT replace . Toxicity expect DTP348 relate nitro-imidazole compound include nausea , vomit flushing , dizziness , skin rash , neurotoxicity . Related sulfamide component study drug , side-effects may include nausea vomit . In experimental mouse study , toxicity observe use dose 10 mg/kg i.v . 3 400 mg/kg per o , correspond Human Equivalent Dose ( HED ) 1.2 g/m2 nimorazole . Once Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) DTP348 establish , 3 additional patient include dose-level . These patient receive crush tablet undergo blood sample PK investigate whether administration crush tablet affect uptake plasma level study drug . This group patient add frequent occurrence swallow problem HNSCC patient population use tube feed need crush tablet . Once MTD DTP348 single agent determine , study continue combination phase : In DTP348 combination radiotherapy dose-escalation phase , 3+3 dose-escalation design use . The start dose DT348 MTD minus two dose level . DTP348 give continuously 7 day week , start 2 week whole course radiation include last day . The rationale start study drug 2 week start radiotherapy similar design phase II trial perform follow study . The drug give orally 1-2 hour daily delivery radiotherapy . Food intake allow one hour intake study drug . The dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observation period dose level day 1 combine therapy 4 week end therapy . Patients complete DLT observation period reason DLT replace . The radiation treatment DTP348 combination radiotherapy dose-escalation phase either conventional standard fractionate radiotherapy total dose 70 Gy 35 fraction 7 week concomitant boost technique , 5 fraction week accelerate radiotherapy deliver total dose 68-70 Gy shorten overall treatment time ( 5.5 - 6 week ) . The 95 % isodose prescribe dose encompass least 99 % planning target homogeneity accord ICRU guideline . There restriction treatment technique may use : multiple static conformal intensity modulate beam , intensity modulate arc treatment , robotic , non-isocentric treatment . Dummy run virtual patient need perform inclusion . Subsequently , patient allow included trial .</detailed_description>
