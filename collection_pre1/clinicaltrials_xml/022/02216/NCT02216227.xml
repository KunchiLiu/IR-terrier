Hypotheses : 1 . The SSI checklist effective reduce MRSA SSIs among total joint arthroplasty cardiac surgery patient . 2 . Implementation checklist associate overall reduction SSIs cause pathogen . 3 . The SSI Checklist cost-saving since prevent many expensive SSIs . 4 . Preoperative MRSA test modifiable barrier implement SSI checklist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims Design : Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , account estimate 94,000 invasive infection 19,000 death annually U.S . In order prevent MRSA infection among veteran , VA successfully implement VA MRSA Prevention Initiative reduce patient-to-patient transmission MRSA . However , Initiative prevent MRSA surgical site infection ( SSIs ) MRSA SSIs usually cause MRSA transfer patient 's nose surgical incision site . Cardiac surgery total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ; e.g . hip knee surgery ) among common operation perform VA associate particularly high clinical economic impact . In order eliminate MRSA SSIs VA , study group develop checklist base meta-analysis study assess method prevent gram-positive SSIs among TJA cardiac surgery patient . This SSI Checklist include preoperatively testing surgical patient 's nose asymptomatic MRSA colonization . If patient MRSA colonize , s/he treat prophylactic nasal mupirocin ointment , chlorhexidine gluconate bath , antibiotic prophylaxis cefazolin vancomycin . The SSI Checklist implement 10 VA Medical Centers ( VAMCs ) . A high-quality quasi-experimental study , qualitative process evaluation perform assess SSI Checklist . The goal project 1 ) ass effectiveness cost-effectiveness checklist prevent MRSA SSIs among veteran undergo TJA cardiac surgery , 2 ) ass barrier facilitator checklist implementation . Methods : This study include quantitative qualitative component . In quantitative component , SSI Checklist implement 10 VAMCs 3 year outcomes compare intervention group two control group : 1 ) 5 year historic data 10 VAMCs , 2 ) 8 year ( 5 historic year 3 intervention year ) concurrent data VAMCs implement SSI Checklist . Study endpoint include : 1 ) MRSA SSIs define Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) ; 2 ) SSIs cause pathogen ; 3 ) cost per SSI prevent , cost per life-saved , cost per MRSA SSI prevent cost per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ) save . VA databases include VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( VASQIP ) , VA Decision Support System , VA Inpatient Evaluation Center ( IPEC ) Veterans ' Informatics &amp; Computing Infrastructure ( VINCI ) use collect data . Time series analysis linear mixed effect model use statistical analysis . In qualitative component , process evaluation conduct 6 different VAMCs , include collect data , implementation , examine contextual factor stakeholder perspective influence adoption SSI Checklist . Observations semi-structured interview conduct Years 1 3 , along thematic content analysis , examine facilitator barrier implementation different study site . The Consolidated Framework Implementation Research use guide process evaluation provide foundation systematic evaluation local contextual factor influence implementation SSI Checklist . The product study include validate SSI Checklist , business-case analysis , implementation toolkit , team experience checklist implementation prevention infection . At end study period , study team meet operational partner include National Infectious Disease Program Office ( NIDS ) MRSA / Multidrug-resistant Program Office ( MDRO ) , National Center Occupational Health Infection Control ( COHIC ) discus implement checklist nationwide part VA MRSA Prevention Initiative . This study high potential significantly decrease SSI , turn morbidity mortality due SSIs , Nation 's Veterans .</detailed_description>
