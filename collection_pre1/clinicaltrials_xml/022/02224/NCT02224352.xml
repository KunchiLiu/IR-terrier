	<brief_summary>Background : Over one million patient US estimate undergo mechanical ventilation every year , approximately 300,000 fail attempt wean . The morbidity mortality patient great patient successfully wean . It follow treatment aim reduce duration mechanical ventilation potential benefit society term human suffer cost . Patients fail attempt wean assist inspiratory muscle inhalation recruit expiratory muscle exhalation . Unfortunately , recruitment occurs relatively late wean trial . The knowledge ( ) expiratory muscle recruitment assist inspiration , ( b ) recruitment expiratory muscle delay weaning , ( c ) respiratory muscle patient require mechanical ventilation catabolic state raise possibility strategy design produce early recruitment , improve strength , expiratory muscle could improve wean outcome difficult wean patient . The current investigation , conduct healthy subject ambulatory patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Edward Hines Jr. VAH ( Aims 1 2 ) , patient difficult wean mechanical ventilation RML Specialty Hospital , Hinsdale , IL ( Aim 3 ) , design develop assess novel trigger algorithm ( VentFree ) , control delivery non-invasive neuro muscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) abdominal-wall muscle exhalation , study physiological ( respiratory ) responses stimulation assist respiration healthy subject , ambulatory patient COPD patient require pronged mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aim 1 Aim 2 : Healthy Subjects Ambulatory COPD Patients Studied Hines VAH Healthy subject ( Hines VAH ) , Inclusion criterion : Age ≥ 18 year No history acute chronic respiratory disease , cardiac neuromuscular disease . Ambulatory COPD patient ( Hines VAH ) , Inclusion criterion : Age ≥ 18 year Chronic airway obstruction define forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) 70 % predict less , ratio force expiratory volume one second force vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) 0.7 less Stable clinical condition without exacerbation precede four week Aim 3 : Patients wean prolonged mechanical ventilation ( RML Specialty Hospital ) , Inclusion criterion : Age ≥ 18 year History neuromuscular disease Body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2 Patients receive mechanical ventilation least 14 day primary physician judge patient ready start wean Able breathe spontaneously 5 minute less 12 hour Clinically stable : oxygen saturation &gt; 90 % fractional inspired oxygen ≤ 0.40 , external PEEP ≤ 5 cm H2O , temperature range 35.5 38.5Co , intravenous administration vasoactive agent . Additional inclusion/exclusion criterion potential participant Subjects implant electronic device cardiac pacemaker , defibrillator intrathecal pump exclude NMES could cause malfunction device . Only subject intact abdominalwall skin enrol NMES cause discomfort apply skin irritate open wound . Pregnancy contraindication participate study unknown whether application NMES abdominal lumbar area pregnancy may produce adverse effect . Unable comprehend interact English .</criteria>
