	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether initial treatment either combination ipilimumab-nivolumab ( subsequent dabrafenib combination trametinib ) dabrafenib combination trametinib ( subsequent ipilimumab-nivolumab ) significantly improve 2 year overall survival ( OS ) patient unresectable stage III stage IV BRAFV600 mutant melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact initial treatment median OS hazard ratio death . II . To determine whether initial treatment choice significantly improve 3 year OS . III . To evaluate anti-tumor activity ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] -defined response rate , median progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) safety profile ipilimumab-nivolumab dabrafenib-trametinib Cooperative Group trial patient V600 mutant melanoma . IV . To evaluate activity ( RECIST-defined response rate , median PFS ) safety dabrafenib-trametinib patient disease progression ipilimumab-nivolumab comparison activity safety ipilimumab-nivolumab naive patient . V. To evaluate activity ipilimumab-nivolumab ( RECIST-defined response rate , median PFS ) safety patient disease progression dabrafenib-trametinib comparison activity safety dabrafenib-trametinib naive patient . VI . To assess feasibility crossover alternative treatment strategy ( percentage patient able crossover one arm complete least initial course treatment cross-over without intervene symptomatic disease progression treatment limit toxicity ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Association inherit variation immune mediate adverse event response ipilimumab/nivolumab . II . To determine association inherit genetic variation immune-associated adverse event patient metastatic melanoma treat ipilimumab contain regimen complete candidate-based gene pathway analyse gene involve lymphocyte activation , cytokine , cytokine receptor within major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) region agnostic genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based approach . III . To investigate association inherited genetics survival patient metastatic melanoma treat ipilimumab contain regimen complete candidate-based gene pathway analyse gene involve lymphocyte activation , cytokine profile , cytokine receptor within MHC region agnostic genome-wide SNP-based approach . IV . To replicate genomic marker identify aims independent sample set patient treat ipilimumab contain regimen preliminarily characterize potential functional role complete replication variation associate immune-related adverse event ( irAEs ) survival bio-informatic assessment genomic marker . V. To determine utility circulate BRAF level determine response resistance either BRAF/MEK direct and/or combination immunotherapy patient BRAF mutant melanoma . VI . To determine change blood BRAF level utilize peripheral blood BRAFV600 mutational testing patient stage IV BRAF mutant melanoma correlate response resistance combination BRAF/MEK direct therapy . VII . To determine change blood BRAF level utilize peripheral blood BRAFV600 mutational testing patient stage IV BRAF mutant melanoma correlate response resistance combination immunotherapy . VIII . To compare kinetics peripheral blood BRAFV600 level response resistance group patient receive BRAF target therapy combination immunotherapy initial therapy . IX . To compare kinetics peripheral blood BRAFV600 level response resistance combination BRAF target therapy combination immunotherapy individual patient ( initial treatment v crossover treatment ) . PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate difference overall health initial treatment arm ( dabrafenib + trametinib vs. ipilimumab + nivolumab immunotherapy ) 2 year , account toxicity overall survival . ( Primary ) II . To assess difference overall function 2 year initial treatment dabrafenib + trametinib vs. ipilimumab + nivolumab . ( Secondary ) III . To document effect treatment crossover treatment administration sequence symptom burden overall function . ( Secondary ) IV . To compare difference function symptom treatment sequence ipilimumab + nivolumab ( arm A vs. D ) , dabrafenib + trametinib , ( arm B vs. C ) baseline , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month initiation treatment . V. To describe frequency severity treatment toxicity baseline , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month initiation treatment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( Arm A Arm B ) .

Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . IMMUNOTHERAPY MAINTENANCE ( COURSES 3-14 ) : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon disease progression , patient re-register cross Arm C. ARM C : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) trametinib PO daily day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID trametinib PO daily day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon disease progression , patient re-register cross Arm D. ARM D : IMMUNOTHERAPY INDUCTION ( COURSES 1-2 ) : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 22 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . IMMUNOTHERAPY MAINTENANCE ( COURSES 3-14 ) : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .
