	<brief_title>Effect Including Fitness Testing Preventive Health Checks Cardiorespiratory Fitness Motivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Changing unhealthy lifestyle improve health reduces morbidity . Motivation key component initiation maintenance lifestyle change . Identifying motivate individual unhealthy lifestyle change behaviour may achieve preventive health check already implemented country . However , knowledge impact individual component include preventive health check lack . Consequently , effective composition preventive health check remain unknown . In Danish municipality , Check Health Prevention Program ( CHPP ) recently initiate , offer preventive health check 30 49 year-old citizen . This program provide unique opportunity evaluate single component preventive health check real-life setting . Only previous study include cardiorespiratory fitness ( fitness ) test preventive health check . Fitness associate multiple health benefit improve cardio-metabolic profile reduce risk cancer , diabetes , depression . The investigator aim investigate effect include fitness test preventive health check fitness level , motivation change physical activity behaviour , physical inactivity prevalence self-rated health . The investigator hypothesize fitness test part preventive health check compare preventive health check without fitness test 1 ) increase fitness level assess one year percentage participant increase motivation change physical activity behaviour assess two week , 2 ) reduces physical inactivity prevalence improve self-rated health score one-year study period . METHODS Nested-design The present trial embed mentioned health promotion program , CHPP , conduct year 2012 2017 . In CHPP , citizens live municipality Randers age 30-49 year per 1st January 2012 ( n = 26,216 ) identify Danish Civil Registration System.The identified population randomize five equal group , one year CHPP . Invitations dispatch continuously mail include information CHPP prefix appointment health check . Health check health behavioural course take place Randers Health Centre health consultation citizen´s general practitioner . The health check Besides addition fitness test intervention group , preventive health check include assessment follow : body weight height , waist circumference , blood pressure , lipid profile ( total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride ) , HbA1c lung function . Moreover , baseline questionnaire regard physical activity level , motivation change physical activity behaviour , self-rated health , smoking , alcohol answer connection health check . At end health check , result present personalized health profile leaflet , include recommendation follow-up accord risk-profile . The baseline questionnaire subsequent follow-up procedure identical two study group . Standardization education The health check conduct health professional train measurement procedure well risk communication ensure standardization quality . Execution health check standardize write protocol adherence protocol check continuously . Furthermore , process evaluation conduct . Outcome assessment Cardiorespiratory fitness assess submaximal cycle ergometer test . Motivation change physical activity behavior assess use Transtheoretical Model´s Stages Change , secondary outcome use modified version question develop Saltin Grimby Short-Form 12 , Health Survey , version 2 . Follow All participant receive questionnaire regard motivation change physical activity behaviour two week health check invite fitness test one year . Randomization blind Randomization handle data-manager scientific involvement . The eligible population trial define CHPP randomization . Citizens randomize third five year CHPP randomize household either intervention control present trial . The intervention , outcomes , group assignment , future outcome assessment trial unrevealed invitation CHPP . The health behavioural course health consultation carry un-blinded due real-life setting . At one-year follow-up , personnel assess outcomes independent blind group allocation . Sample size An estimate sample size 1,500 participant allow categorical analysis fitness level calculate basis follow assumption : 1:1 randomization , false positive error rate 0.05 , power 0.8 , intracluster correlation coefficient 0.05 categorical analysis power detect difference 10 % prevalence low fitness study group . The investigator determine 10 % difference clinically meaningful base expert opinion criteria employ research . The intracluster correlation coefficient include reflect possible cluster effect general practitioner ( n = 46 ) , seldom great 0.05 primary care setting . The estimated sample size account 30 % loss follow-up . Statistics Statistical analysis perform use STATA 12.0 software . Continuous variable present mean ±standard deviation categorical variable absolute number relative ( % ) frequency . In comparative analysis Student´s t-test use , compare mean change mean continuous variable Chi2-test Fisher 's exact t-test , compare proportion categorical variable . Analyses adjust baseline physical activity . Stratified analysis perform sex age group analysis motivation perform subgroup comprise precontemplaters , contemplaters , preparators baseline . All analysis follow intention-to-treat principle . If appropriate , multiple imputation method apply ( use data social medical national registry couple health check data ) , sensitivity analysis perform . Moreover , potential effect cluster general practitioner investigate . The statistical significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . ETHICS AND LEGAL ASPECTS The trial comply The Declaration Helsinki participant provide write informed consent data use research purpose agreement Danish Health Law . Approval The Danish Data Protection Agency obtain ( 2013-41-2527 ) .</detailed_description>
