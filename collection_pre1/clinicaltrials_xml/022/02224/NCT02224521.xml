	<detailed_description>GSK2190915 high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein ( FLAP ) inhibitor attenuate production leukotrienes , blockage first committed step leukotriene pathway , 5 lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) activation . Leukotrienes potent inflammatory molecule produce mainly mast cell , eosinophil , monocytes/macrophage neutrophil response allergic inflammatory stimulus . Clinical study conduct date GSK2190915 utilise aqueous formulation compound . However , progress compound clinical development , solid dose formulation necessary . This study evaluate optimal capsule formulation selection three available capsule formulation , dose , take forward future clinical development . Since expect compound develop Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , study also include repeat-dose cohort elderly subject ( smoker non-smokers 65 year age ) order evaluate repeat-dose derive pharmacokinetic parameter select capsule formulation population . This multi-cohort study upto 6 cohort perform . In cohort 1 , bioavailability single dose 50 milligrammes ( 50 mg ) three capsule formulation ( capsule formulation A , B C ) fast state assess . Depending bioavailability data obtain cohort 1 , one , two three capsule formulation may take forward cohort 2 . If one formulation deem suitable progression , cohort 2 single-dose , 4-way complete crossover study investigate food-effect dose proportionality 10 healthy adult subject . The decision progress formulation final ( repeat-dose ) cohort ( cohort 4 ) make base favourable food interaction proportionality bioavailability high low dos cohort 2 . If one capsule formulation fulfil bioavailability criterion follow cohort 1 , cohort 2 food-effect study 100mg single dose two three select capsule formulation healthy adult subject . Progression Cohort 3 dependent formulation/s meeting predetermine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) criterion . Cohort 3 complete crossover study single dose 20mg 200mg upto two capsule formulation take forward cohort 2 10 healthy adult subject fast state . The aim perform cohort explore dose proportionality low high dos two select capsule formulation . Cohort 4 12-day repeat-dose , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study 12 healthy elderly subject ( &gt; 65 year ) feed fasted state once-daily dose high dose ( 200mg ) capsule formulation ( A , B C ) take forward previous cohort . The aim cohort investigate accumulation select formulation repeat dose . Cohort 5 4-way complete crossover study single dose 100mg two tablet formulation ( mill micronised ) administer healthy volunteer feed fast state . The aim perform cohort explore single-dose pharmacokinetics two tablet formulation view assess suitability use subsequent late- phase study . Cohort 6 4-way complete crossover study single dose 100mg two modified tablet formulation ( different Cohort 5 formulation ) administer healthy volunteer feed fast state . The aim perform cohort explore single-dose pharmacokinetics two modify tablet formulation view assess suitability use subsequent late- phase study .</detailed_description>
