	<detailed_description>With increase life span population , prevalence dementia syndromes increase . The frequent cause dementia Alzheimer´s disease ( AD ) , still , curable . Thus , AD increase medical , social economic importance . Intensive scientific work within past 30 year identify range different factor contribute pathogenesis AD . These complex process result specific therapeutic option currently investigate clinical trial . Regardless consider risk factor specific therapeutic intervention , treatment start early excessive preclinical process AD possible since interfere formation amyloid plaque neurofibrils . Especially neuroprotective intervention effective less neuron irreversibly damaged.Therefore , early diagnosis develop incipient AD utmost importance . Likewise , light therapeutic option specific AD , differential diagnosis form dementia seem important . Therefore , ideal examination method easy conduct , cost effective , repeatable , non-invasive without discomfort patient , particular detect early stage disease , possible , consider development AD-specific change . Obviously , today´s routine examination method diagnosis AD MCI magnetic resonance imaging , cerebrospinal fluid analysis positron emission tomography fulfil requirement . Thus , absence single diagnostic test realize necessity combine biomarkers increase diagnostic accuracy still need method circumvent disadvantage . Since early cellular change disease expect impact brain function long severe morphological alteration occur , change primarily investigate use functional examination conduct neurocognitive method intensive neuropsychological rating electrophysiological functional brain imaging method . Neuropsychological rating Prior study investigate predictive validity different cognitive measure development AD associative learning , verbal fluency constructive praxis . As , verbal non-verbal memory , visual-spatial executive function verbal fluency executive component seem suit follow deterioration cognition . In subject later develop AD MCI compare healthy control , bad performance episodic memory accord ( Delayed Verbal Visual Memory und Associative Learning ) semantic verbal fluency know characteristic . An extended neuropsychologic test measure cognitive process thus seem reasonable particular evaluate additional benefit diagnostic method . Vagus somatosensory evoke potential ( VSEP ) As know today , AD long preclinical course spread pattern specific AD pathology neurofibrillary tangle uniform sequence predictable step . Many nuclei early involved AD like Locus caeruleus , parabrachial nucleus Raphe nucleus take equally part afferences Xth cranial nerve , Vagus nerve . Our laboratory use hypothesis-driven approach develop method functional assessment Vagus-related nucleus lower brainstem result technique somatosensory evoke potential Vagus nerve ( VSEP ) . This method target accessibility early functional change evoke potential one hand early affection specific brainstem nuclei comprise Vagus afferences course AD hand . The method VSEP take advantage transcutaneous stimulation auricular branch Vagus nerve ( ABVN ) . It presume sensory part nerve innervate part outer meatus acoustic tragus . This cutaneous branch show gain access Vagus afferences via Solitary tract nucleus affect course AD well . The technique VSEP meanwhile well characterized methodological point view . There numerous finding suggest observed potential generate brainstem level detect far field potential scalp without side effect . VSEP reproducible amplitude well latency range correspond parameter acoustic evoked potential . Detailed examination functional magnetic imaging reveal cortical activation pattern upon ABVN stimulation comparable activation pattern response conventional invasive stimulation main Vagus branch . In subsequent work , even involvement brainstem activation demonstrate could relate ascend Vagus nerve projection . As , VSEP propose possible mean early detection AD mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . VSEP latencies group show significantly longer compare healthy control . No difference VSEP parameter find patient Vascular dementia Major depression . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) NIRS measure change cerebral oxygenation mean near-infrared light use wavelengths 650-850 nm . The principle NIRS base principle neurovascular couple state regional neuronal activation brain lead increase metabolism oxygenation brain tissue region accompany elevated regional cerebral blood flow . This turn lead increase oxygen saturation elevate concentration oxygenate haemoglobin diminish concentration deoxygenate haemoglobin . In last year , functional NIRS ( fNIRS ) increasingly apply measure change oxygen saturation cortical area variety cognitive task example verbal fluency test thus detect specific cortical activation visual motor system , also cortical area relevant cognitive task prefrontal parietal cortex remain stable replicable . In AD , grow body literature report deviant fNIRS activation pattern variety task . For example , young healthy subject display distinct activation pattern prefrontal cortex verbal fluency test ( VFT ) show leave hemispheric lateralization decrease age without decline behavioural performance . In contrast , subject AD show bad behavioural performance even severe decrease prefrontal activation well reduce leave lateralization compare age-adjusted healthy control group . Likewise , show fNIRS activation pattern frontal parietal cortex area subject AD perform line orientation paradigm clearly different healthy control . Aim study To summarize , VSEP , fNIRS neuropsychological rating able differentiate AD healthy control . From theoretical point view , method even suit mean detection disease early phase well . If really suit mean purpose examine present study . Therefore aim test predictive value method early detection AD . In presented research project , 600 subject examine baseline mean VSEP , fNIRS extend neuropsychological , somatic laboratory examination reexamine 3 6 year later . The hypothesis test within study state subject develop AD MCI within observation period depict longer VSEP latency , different fNIRS oxygenation pattern low performance neuropsychologic rating level dementia baseline remain cognitively stable .</detailed_description>
