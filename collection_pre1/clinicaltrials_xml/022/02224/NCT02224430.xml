	<brief_title>Prediction Relapse Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder With Smartphones On-body Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow group participant recently discharge emergency room hospital use several new `` high-tech '' method , include use smartphone , health wellness wristbands/watches optional arm patch sensor . These device ( commercially available public purchase ) , capture ongoing physiological information include sweat gland activity , movement , skin temperature , heart rate , breathe rate , sleep . The smart phone , installed application , administer bidaily weekly symptom assessment , track general location participant , collect statistic text message cell phone use . In addition on-body device participant come clinical research office complete clinical scale every week . These scale use determine symptom exacerbation relapse . This signature utilized marker examine data collect device . The investigator hope go beyond clinical evaluation identify signature relapse reliably detect body device natural setting . This would cut time take successfully treat psychotic illness would reduce amount pain suffering experience patient relapse .</detailed_description>
