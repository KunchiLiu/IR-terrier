	<detailed_description>Type II diabetes associate host adverse costly complication , include heart attack , stroke , blindness , kidney failure , severe neuropathy may result amputation . For diabetes , intensive glycemic control essential minimize complication . Medication adherence , weight loss , increase exercise improve diet show significantly improve glycemic control , result improve health outcome low medical cost , include reduction emergency department visit hospitalization . Yet , despite significant health benefit associate adherence diet exercise regime take diabetes medication prescribe , non-adherence three significant problem . One strategy improve adherence thus long term health outcome provide clear short term benefit . For example , consistent evidence adherence exercise medication regimen could receive subsidy incentive . Therefore , investigator propose test three theory-based intervention strategy aim improve diabetes outcomes amongst population uncontrolled patient ( Haemoglobin A1c , HbA1c , level 8.0 great baseline ) . The propose 6-month study randomise 240 participant , 60 control arm 90 incentivized arm Geylang Polyclinic . The first strategy involve incentive include Diabetes Educational Program ( DEP ) help patient manage condition . Included program text message encourage participant take medication prescribe prompt good dietary exercise practice . Subsequent strategy incorporate incentive core component . The incentive tie either process aim improve blood sugar level ( glucose testing , physical activity medication adherence ) directly intermediary outcome ( blood glucose acceptable range ) . While process incentive likely provide motivation treatment adherence , goal may comparably easier meet , incentives reward intermediary outcome might effective reward successfully achieve health outcome directly . The investigator see important empirical question answer propose trial . Another advantage outcome incentive likely cost-effective process incentive incentive spend result . Aims hypotheses test : - Aim 1A : To determine add financial incentive diabetes management Diabetes Educational Program ( DEP ) , comprise text messaging use study device encourage patient medical adherence prompt good dietary well exercise practice , effective improve diabetes health outcome compare DEP alone . - Hypothesis 1A : The average reduction HbA1c level 6 month great participant incentive arm compare participant DEP arm . - Aim 1B : To determine whether incentivising health outcome ( self-monitored blood sugar within acceptable range ) effective improve diabetes health outcome incentivising intermediate process ( blood glucose testing , physical activity medical adherence ) aim improve primary outcome . - Hypothesis 1B : The average reduction HbA1c level 6 month great participant health outcome incentive arm compare participant process incentive arm . - Aim 2 : To determine intervention ( i.e . incentivising process outcome ) cost effective ( incrementally ) achieve reduction HbA1c level 6 month . - Hypothesis 2 : The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ( ICER ) intervention incentivising health outcome great intervention incentivising process . - Aim 3A : To determine whether add financial incentive diabetes management effective improve treatment adherence ( assess base whether self-monitored blood sugar fall within acceptable range ) incentivizing intermediate process aim improve primary outcome . - Hypothesis 3A : The average increase proportion medication blood test take prescribed average number daily step 6 month great participant incentive arm compare participant DEP arm . - Aim 3B : To determine whether incentivising treatment adherence ( assess self-monitored blood sugar fall within acceptable range ) effective improve treatment adherence incentivising intermediate process aim improve primary outcome . - Hypothesis 3B : The average increase proportion medication blood test take prescribed average number daily step 6 month great participant outcome incentive arm compare participant process incentive arm .</detailed_description>
