	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Efficacy Safety Cannabidiol ( GWP42003-P ; CBD ) Adjunctive Treatment Seizures Associated With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Children Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 1:1:1 randomize , double-blind , 14-week comparison two Dose Levels GWP42003-P versus placebo . The treatment period consist two-week titration period follow 12-week maintenance period . The study aim determine efficacy , safety tolerability GWP42003-P compare placebo . The High Dose Level recommend Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) assessment safety pharmacokinetic data Part A study GWEP1332 . The Low Dose Level define 50 % High Dose Level . The first subject enroll study DSMC review safety data Part A study GWEP1332 . Following study completion , subject invite continue receive GWP42003-P open label extension ( OLE ) study ( separate protocol ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Subject must male female age two 55 year ( inclusive ) . Subject must document history LennoxGastaut syndrome . This include write documentation meet electroencephalogram ( EEG ) diagnostic criterion patient 's history evidence least one type generalize seizure , include drop seizure ( atonic , tonic , tonicclonic myoclonic ) least six month . Subjects history slow ( &lt; 2.5 Hz ) spikeandwave pattern EEG prior enrollment baseline period . Subjects refractory ; document failures one antiepileptic drug ( AED ) . Subject must take one AEDs dose stable least four week prior screen . All medication intervention epilepsy ( include ketogenic diet vagus nerve stimulation [ VNS ] ) must stable four week prior screen patient willing maintain stable regimen throughout study . The ketogenic diet VNS treatment account AED . Key Etiology subject 's seizure progressive neurologic disease . Subjects tuberous sclerosis exclude study participation , unless progressive tumor . Subject anoxic episode require resuscitation within six month screen . Subject clinically significant unstable medical condition epilepsy . Subject clinically relevant symptom clinically significant illness four week prior screen randomization , epilepsy . Subject currently use past use recreational medicinal cannabis , synthetic cannabinoid base medication ( include SativexÂ® ) within three month prior study entry unwilling abstain duration study . Subject know suspected hypersensitivity cannabinoids excipients Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) , sesame oil . Subject part clinical trial involve another IMP previous six month . Subject significantly impair hepatic function screening ( Visit 1 ) randomization ( Visit 2 ) ( Alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] &gt; 5 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] total bilirubin [ TBL ] &gt; 2 x ULN ) OR ALT Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 3 x ULN ( TBL &gt; 2 x ULN international normalize ratio &gt; 1.5 ) . This criterion confirm laboratory result available ; subject randomize study later find meet criterion withdrawn study . Any history suicidal behavior suicidal ideation type four five Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale last month screen . Subject take four concurrent AEDs . Subject take corticotropin six month prior screen . Subject currently take longterm systemic steroid ( exclude inhale medication asthma treatment ) daily medication know exacerbate epilepsy . An exception make prophylactic medication , example , idiopathic nephrotic syndrome asthma . Subject take felbamate , take less one year prior screening .</criteria>
