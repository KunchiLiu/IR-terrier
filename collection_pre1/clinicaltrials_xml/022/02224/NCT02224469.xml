	<brief_summary>In study new mean communication people locked-in syndrome test . The investigator record brain signal directly surface brain mean completely implantable system . These brain signal feed wirelessly assistive technology device control device communication environmental control user home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Study With Brain Implant Help Locked-in Patients Communicate Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study provide locked-in people new mean communication possible . For first time , test whether record decode neural signal obtain directly brain , control computer . The target population people locked-in syndrome . For patient technique available allow communicate unaided . We develop brain-computer interface ( BCI ) system read activity directly brain , convert activity digital switch . The system , call Utrecht Neural Prosthesis ( UNP ) , consist implantable amplifier electrical brain signal , set electrode position surface brain wireless receiver , place outside body . A dedicated computer convert signal electrical pulse standard Assistive Technology device . The UNP principle enable patient engage activity offer commercial Assistive Technology company perform switch signal , instance operating home apparatus write text . Most importantly , aim achieve unsupervised function BCI , mean patient able use home without aid researcher expert ( minimal caregiver assistance ) .</detailed_description>
