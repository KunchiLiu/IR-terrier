	<brief_title>Effect Intense Training Ovarian Function Bone Turnover</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female athletes participate sport emphasize leanness factor success , also impose large exercise training load , present high prevalence endocrine metabolic alteration link low energy store , include suppressed ovarian function bone loss . Increased bone turnover result low energy store suppress estrogen production may hold adverse consequence long term health , increase risk premature osteopenia , increase risk stress fracture short term . Chronically low energy store may also contribute development overreach overtraining syndrome , characterize excessive , lasting fatigue long-term decrease performance , compromise athlete ' health athletic career . The investigator propose first longitudinal study aim demonstrate link low energy status , impaired ovarian function , bone turnover decrease performance free-living , competitive female athlete . After 4-week baseline period habitual training , athletes undergo 4 week intensified training ( IT ) , exercise load increase 30 % individual baseline load order sharply increase energy expenditure . As athlete let freely adjust food intake , investigator aim test hypothesis athlete fail adjust food intake sufficiently match energy expenditure , result decrease energy availability ( EA , energy intake - energy expenditure exercise ) influence , dose-dependent fashion , suppression estrogen production , increase bone turnover severity performance decrement . The IT period follow 2-week taper ( REC ) , exercise training volume reduce 50 % baseline . The investigator assess whether EA return baseline value , characterize change bone turnover recovery period . It hypothesize improvement exercise performance result IT + REC occur athletes able remain close balance energy state IT . Concretely link EA performance bone health may incentivize female athlete adopt adequate feeding behavior activity level .</detailed_description>
