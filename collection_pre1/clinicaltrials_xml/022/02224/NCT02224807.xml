	<brief_summary>This pilot/feasibility trial seek explore whether acute bout negative energy balance prior surgery affect biomarkers neoplasia . Forty overweight obese postmenopausal woman diagnose ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) early stage breast cancer ( Stage I II ) elect mastectomy lumpectomy randomly assign 1-of-2 study arm : 1 ) Attention Control Group receive instruction dietary approach correct nutritional deficiency progressive resistance training ( PRT ) target arm ipsilateral affect breast ; 2 ) Experimental Group receive PRT guidance correct nutritional deficiency plus intensive intervention promote 1.5-2 pound/week weight loss diet , exercise , behavior modification . This study explore contrast change body mass index ( BMI ) observe enrollment time surgery experimental vs. attention control arm , also monitor change energy intake physical activity . These change study relation follow endpoint : ) change select circulate biomarkers gene expression relate cancer progression , hormonal status , inflammation energy-related factor ; b ) rate tumor proliferation apoptosis ; c ) tumor marker , e.g. , insulin receptor , Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , Nuclear Factor kappa beta ( NFkB ) , phosphoproteins associate Convergence Hormones , Inflammation Energy-Rated Factors ( CHIEF ) pathway ; ) functional health-related outcome . Because tumor tissue blood examine pre-to-post-intervention , study provide excite new data elucidate pathway energy balance affect breast cancer progression . Although long term weight loss recommend overweight obese breast cancer survivor , know whether place body state negative energy balance favorable impact tumor . If beneficial change tumor biology host environment occur short-term , pre-surgical weight loss , study provide proof concept weight loss may offer acceptable complementary treatment option could combine standard therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity know risk factor invasive breast cancer occur post-menopause . Obese woman also die twice frequently breast cancer normal weight . Numerous preclinical study show benefit caloric restriction cancer progression animal - , similar effect see human ? In response call translational study identify biological/biobehavioral pathway weight loss may affect cancer prognosis ( PAR-12-229 ) , investigator propose pilot study build investigator success pre-surgical intervention answer research question , `` negative energy balance concomitant weight loss invoke anti-cancer effect tumor biology host environment ? '' The investigator randomly assign 40 overweight obese postmenopausal woman diagnose ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) early stage breast cancer elect mastectomy lumpectomy 1-of-2 study arm : 1 ) Attention Control Group receive instruction dietary approach correct nutritional deficiency progressive resistance training ( PRT ) target arm ipsilateral affect breast ; 2 ) Experimental Group receive PRT guidance correct nutritional deficiency plus intensive intervention promote 1.5-2 pound/week weight loss diet , exercise , behavior modification . This study explore contrast change body mass index ( BMI ) observe enrollment time surgery experimental vs. attention control arm , also monitor change energy intake physical activity . These change study relation follow endpoint : ) change select circulate biomarkers gene expression relate cancer progression , hormonal status , inflammation energy-related factor ; b ) rate tumor proliferation apoptosis ; c ) tumor marker , e.g. , insulin receptor , Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , Nuclear Factor kappa beta ( NFkB ) , phosphoproteins associate Convergence Hormones , Inflammation Energy-Rated Factors ( CHIEF ) pathway ; ) functional health-related outcome . Because tumor tissue blood examine pre-to-post-intervention , study provide excite new data elucidate pathway energy balance affect breast cancer progression non-invasive invasive state . Although long term weight loss recommend overweight obese breast cancer survivor , know whether place body state negative energy balance favorable impact tumor . If beneficial change tumor biology host environment occur short-term , pre-surgical weight loss , study provide proof concept weight loss may offer acceptable complementary treatment option could combine standard therapy . Thus , research propose increase investigator understanding impact negative energy balance tumor biology , could change standard care offer conservative treatment option 50,000 American woman diagnose DCIS year , well novel adjunct therapy woman early stage invasive disease .</detailed_description>
