	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose progressive and/or refractory solid malignancy ( SM ) , fail conventional therapy , available , potentially curative therapeutic option , candidate Phase I/II study . Following confirmation disease progression and/or refractoriness , eligible patient agree participate sign consent form tumor cells/tissues and/or blood analyze expression specific panel Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens ( TAPAs ) , include Sp17 , ropporin , AKAP-4 , PTTG1 , Span-xb , Her-2/neu , HM1.24 , NY-ESO-1 MAGE-1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Patients With Progressive and/or Refractory Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients whose tumor express one ( 1 ) TAPAs receive three ( 3 ) day subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) increase bone marrow production monocyte dendritic cell ( DC ) precursor , whole blood obtain phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis perform generation autologous DCs . Patient 's DCs generate Kiromic 's Cell Processing GMP facility , accord establish Standard Operating Procedures , activate pulsing/loading TAPA ( ) relevant particular patient . Patients receive five ( 5 ) day low-dose cyclophosphamide prior vaccination TAPA-pulsed DCs decrease Treg activity . TAPA-pulsed DCs administer fix dose 1 X 107 DCs least two ( 2 ) day follow cyclophosphamide administration . DC vaccination schedule every fourteen ( 14 ) day via subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) injection total 6 vaccination . Low dose GM-CSF also administer SC five ( 5 ) consecutive day , start three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) hour TAPA-pulsed DC treatment , optimize immune response . Patients follow weekly basis ( frequently require ) evaluate treatment-related toxicity . Immune efficacy anti-tumor response evaluate per protocol specification . Continuation stop rule study define base toxicity/tolerability ( Phase I ) immune efficacy ( Phase II ) .</detailed_description>
