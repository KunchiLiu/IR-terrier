	<detailed_description>Noninvasive brain stimulation ( NBS ) represent promising set tool neurotherapeutics rehabilitation . In literature search , NBS test seventy neurologic psychiatric condition . NBS may complement exist medical treatment , especially neurologic indication without suitable pharmacotherapies ( e.g . tinnitus , dyskinesia ) patient pharmaco-resistant illness ( e.g . intractable epilepsy , severe depression ) . In particular , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) modulate brain activity deliver low intensity unidirectional current scalp . Rather induce action potential , tDCS modulates rest neuronal transmembrane potential influence brain plasticity . Moreover , pragmatic perspective , tDCS ' benefit include low cost , portability , ease use . Furthermore , tDCS easily combine intervention mental imagery , computerized cognitive intervention , robot-assisted motor activity . Current physiological understanding TDCS affect brain plasticity synaptic , cellular , network level limit . Experimentally , spontaneous neuronal firing activity anode generally increase , fire activity cathode decrease , although precise effect probably depend orientation axon electric field ( Nitsche Paulus , 2000 , Bindman et al. , 1964 , Creutzfeldt et al. , 1962 , Purpura McMurtry , 1965 ) . The neuromodulatory effect tDCS also broadly attribute LTP- LTD-like mechanism synaptic plasticity , involve modulation NMDA-receptor activity , sodium calcium channel activity ( Hattori et al. , 1990 , Islam et al. , 1995 , Liebetanz et al. , 2002 ) . Furthermore , functional neuroimaging study reveal local distant network effect induce tDCS , probably mediate interneuronal circuit ( Lefaucheur , 2008 ) . Advancing investigator mechanistic understanding tDCS affect cortical excitability local distribute level necessary ( 1 ) customize stimulation parameter ( e.g . electrode size , positioning , current intensity duration ) precisely target brain region maximize therapeutic outcome , ( 2 ) confirm safety outcomes vulnerable patient population ( e.g . child , patient skull defect implant hardware ) . Previously , patient scalp skull defect exclude stimulation ( Bikson , 2012 ) protocols theoretical risk current shunt highly conductive CSF collection . However patient penetrate brain injury , stroke , previous brain surgery precisely may benefit technology . Computational model use finite element method ( FEM ) aim determine pattern intensity current flow brain incorporating ( 1 ) stimulation parameter ( 2 ) patient characteristic underlie anatomy tissue property ( e.g . size position skull defect relative electrode configuration ) ( Bikson 2012 ) . For example , one computational model incorporate electrode configuration skull defect size property ( Datta et al. , 2010 ) predict majority electrode configuration surround skull defect ( exception stimulate directly top small skull defect ) significantly increase peak cortical electrical field intensity . Rather , current direct edge bony defect , may counterproductive therapeutic goal . Another computational case study stroke patient demonstrate relatively conductive stroke lesion concentrate current perilesional area , placement reference electrode ( e.g . right , right mastoid , right orbitofrontal , contralateral hemisphere ) significantly alter path great current flow ( Datta et al. , 2011 ) . Yet , model prediction limit clinical application , experimental validation necessary . Quantitative determination electrical field neural tissue level require establish efficacy safety give individual ( Bikson 2012 ) . To investigator knowledge , publish study empirically confirm predict pattern current flow intensity predict model . This propose experimental study represent first-in-kind quantify voltage intensity , measure brain surface , response various stimulation parameter , represent significant advance field noninvasive neurostimulation</detailed_description>
