	<brief_summary>This trial aim collect pilot data explore whether bilateral deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) Nucleus Basalis Meynert ( NBM ) beneficial effect memory think impairment among individual Dementia Lewy Bodies ( DLB ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform pilot study evaluate effectiveness human NBM DBS improve cognitive deficit DLB patient . Six patient DLB moderate cognitive impairment ( include restrict deficit attention work memory ) bilateral DBS electrode implanted ensure superficial contact lie motor Globus Pallidum interna ( GPi ) target , deep electrical contact lie NBM . We place electrode use conventional image-guided , stereotactic frame-based procedure . Once surgical wound heal , patient randomise 2 group crossover trial design 6 week period NBM stimulation switch switch separate 2 week washout period , follow patient cross opposite condition 6 week . Outcome measure collect 6 week 14 week timepoints compare accord whether patient ON OFF stimulation timepoint . At end crossover period , patient invite continued follow stimulation switch neuropsychological evaluation 6 monthly interval . Patients give option receive additional conventional stimulation motor GPi , high contact electrode , end crossover period require coexist Parkinsonian motor complication DLB .</detailed_description>
