	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Imaging Asthma Pre- Post-Bronchial Thermoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one year , single centre randomize control trial . Subjects identified London Asthma Centre locate St. Joseph 's Hospital Hamilton St. Joseph 's Healthcare , give letter information study . The study recruit subject asthma undergo BT part normal clinical care asthma treatment plan . Those interested sign consent form clinic . Bronchial thermoplasty ( BT ) novel FDA approve outpatient asthma treatment procedure aim `` cure '' symptom permanently reduce airway smooth muscle mass lobar segmental bronchus . Under local anesthetic , radiofrequency energy deliver warm airway wall 65 degree celcius . The effect procedure reduction airway smooth muscle mass treat airway result reduced potential bronchoconstriction . Fourteen asthma patient enrol study subject visit centre five occasion ( three pre-treatment visit two post-treatment visit ) . We evaluate pre-therapy optimization use inflammometry , pre-therapy ventilation defect reproducibility BT treatment effect ( pre-treatment visit 1= 5±2 day pre-optimization , pre-treatment visit 2 = 15±7 day pre-BT , pre-treatment visit 3 = 5±2 day pre-BT , post-treatment visit 4=6 week post-BT , post treatment visit 5 = 6 month post-BT ) . At pre-treatment visit 1 , patient randomize image-guided conventional therapy . For subject , visit , spirometry , plethysmography 3He and/or 129Xe MRI perform . Methacholine challenge ( MCh ) perform ( subject FEV1 &gt; 60 % ) pre-treatment visit 3 post-treatment visit 4 spirometry MRI perform pre- post-MCh . Pre-treatment visit 3 include low-dose thoracic CT use generate detail 3D model airway tree . MRI co-registered CT 3D airway render enable spatial comparison ventilation defect airway . All subject also complete bi-weekly weekly quality life questionnaire . Self-reported data upload subject monthly website use confidential password protect upload . MRI lung perform use inhale contrast agent : either Hyperpolarized Helium-3 Hyperpolarized Xenon-129 . Participants inhale hyperpolarized gas perform breathhold 16 second . Two different type image acquire coronal plain visit : 1 ) 1H thoracic cavity , 2 ) 3He and/or 129Xe static ventilation . Respiration oxygen saturation monitor throughout image session .</detailed_description>
