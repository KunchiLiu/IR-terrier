	<brief_summary>Genital HPV necessary cause cervical cancer , well major contribute cause several cancer condition . There effective vaccine main oncogenic HPV type , HPV16 18 . Most research discussion focus target vaccine young woman old adolescent . Based , national free HPV vaccination program adolescent girl commence 2007 , Australia . However , time commencement , research use vaccine immunosuppressed . Therefore , information immunogenicity , safety duration efficacy HPV vaccine administer immunosuppressed child need . This trial look 3 dose schedule quadrivalent HPV vaccine range immunosuppressed child , endpoint immunogenicity , follow 5 year duration immunity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity HPV Vaccine Immunosuppressed Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine immunogenicity , safety persistence immunity follow human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccination three group immunosuppressed child : recipient allogenic bone marrow transplant , recipient renal liver transplant , patient juvenile chronic arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition longterm immunosuppressive therapy . Significance : Immunosuppressed population diverse term degree , type duration immunosuppression . The study compare several group order address heterogeneity immunosuppression affect vaccine response . BMT patient extreme , severe immunosuppression short term , recover immune function time . In contrast , solid organ transplant recipient ongoing , chronic immunosuppression . Although successful cessation immunosuppressives liver transplant patient report , patient require ongoing treatment . The inflammatory bowel disease group patient represent non-transplant group require ongoing , often low level immunosuppression , often corticosteroids . Our study compare three group , follow five year duration immunity . Time vaccine , time serological measure immune response follow . Serum collection : 0 - Baseline ( HPV vaccine dose 1 ) ; 2 month - At time receipt HPV vaccine dose 2 ( measure response dose 1 ) ; 6 month - At time receipt HPV vaccine dose 3 ( measure response dose 2 ) ; 7 month - 1 month HPV vaccine dose 3 ; 12 month - HPV vaccine dose 1 ; 2 year HPV vaccine dose 1 ; 3 year HPV vaccine dose 1 ; 4 year HPV vaccine dose 1 ; 5 year HPV vaccine dose 1 .</detailed_description>
