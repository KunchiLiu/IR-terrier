	<brief_summary>Dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) second common neurodegenerative dementia autopsy series . However , DLB represent small proportion clinical diagnosis epidemiology registry . Indeed Alzheimer disease ( AD ) DLB often concomitant , share many symptom small weight give non-motor symptom DLB diagnosis . DLB end pathological spectrum overlap AD , explain poor diagnostic value diagnostic criterion . To date still need tool able discriminate patient pure DLB express common sign AD DLB pure AD . The purpose study validate semi quantitative scale design reflect Lewy Bodies burden patient mild moderate cognitive decline . The investigator hypothesize score obtain may differentiate AD , DLB patient fulfil clinical criterion DLB AD . This score could also correlate dopaminergic depletion assess [ 18F ] fluorodopa PET/computed tomography and/or potential biomarkers ADD measure cerebrospinal fluid . This clinical validation preliminary work precede study correlate LeSCoD score functional imaging feature , prognosis therapeutic response . Thus , expect outcomes involve improvement demented patient ' care , well well patient selection therapeutic study</brief_summary>
