	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study intermittent dose BRAF inhibitor LGX818 ( encorafenib ) MEK inhibitor MEK 162 ( binimetinib ) treat patient melanoma spread part body ( metastatic ) BRAF V600 mutation . LGX818 MEK162 may stop growth tumor cell block different enzyme need cell growth . Giving LGX818 MEK162 break course ( intermittently ) may help delay time tumor become resistant drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . One year progression free survival ( PFS ) rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain biopsy sample patient treat intermittent schedule LGX818 MEK162 study adaptive acquire resistance well melanoma evolutionary pattern . II . Study molecular change adaptive resistance acquire resistance LGX818 MEK162 circulate melanoma cell . III . Study plasma sample circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , microribonucleic acid ( microRNA ) protein signatures adaptive resistance acquire resistance . IV . Explore median progression free survival overall survival patient receive intermittent schedule LGX818 MEK162 . OUTLINE : Patients receive LGX818 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) MEK162 PO twice daily ( BID ) continuously 8 week , follow intermittent dose subsequent cycle ( 3 week therapy , 5 week therapy ) . Cycles repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
