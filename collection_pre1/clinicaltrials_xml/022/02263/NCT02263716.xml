	<brief_title>Actigraphy MEasuRe Intensive Care Unit Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet inclusion criterion wristwatch size , lightweight ActiGraph GT3X+ place three body site , dominant-side wrist , right hip dominant-side ankle objectively measure physical activity . Patients wear ActiGraph device two 30-minute period direct observation . To compare activity count measure ActiGraph device directly observe purposeful physical activity , record time type physical activity perform patient sit edge bed , sit bedside chair , transfer chair , stand ambulate . The data acquire observational ( AMERCIA ) study seek establish feasibility use accelerometer measure activity diverse population patient medical surgical critical illness .</detailed_description>
