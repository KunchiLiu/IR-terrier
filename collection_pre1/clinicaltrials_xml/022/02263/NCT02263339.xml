	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The investigator study whether aerobic exercise well stretch program improve brain health people MS. We want learn : 1 . If safe practical people MS participate aerobic exercise program goal increase cardiac fitness . Cardiac fitness measure exercise stress test begin end study . 2 . If aerobic exercise improve brain metabolism , reflection brain health , stretch . Brain metabolism measure MRIs begin end study . There 50 % chance aerobic exercise stretch program . There 8 36 visit OHSU , depend intervention group . The total duration study 21 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease brain , spinal cord optic nerve . Current MS therapy reduce frequency severity MS flare-up , help MS later stag disease characterized slow progression disability . One obstacle develop therapy progressive aspect disease lack ability measure progression brain repair . A new MRI technique develop Bill Rooney , PhD , ( co-investigator , OHSU Advanced Imaging Resource Center ) look brain health measuring level phosphorous . Phosphorous level think reflect energy store produce brain cell . The healthier brain , great energy store see high level phosphorous image . Dr. Rooney show decreased level phosphorous brain MRIs people MS. We propose therapy boost brain cell health lead increase brain cell energy store reflect increase phosphorous level MRI spectroscopy . In order test whether improvement brain energy store see increase phosphorous level , use therapy know improve energy store muscle see also brain . We measure much aerobic exercise increase energy store muscle measure oxygen utilization exercise stress test . Therefore study , see aerobic exercise improve muscle energy store ( see increase oxygen utilization ) correspond increase brain energy store ( see increase phosphorous level ) . Specific Aim 1 . To determine safe feasible conduct aerobic exercise intervention MS patient achieve increase oxygen utilization 5-15 % . Hypothesis : An MS cohort undergo structure aerobic exercise program increase aerobic capacity 5-15 % measure oxygen utilization test experience adverse event related exercise program . Specific Aim 2 . To determine brain phosphorous level MR spectroscopy aerobic exercise intervention increase association increase oxygen utilization . Hypothesis : Aerobic exercise increase energy store muscle brain . Body energy store measure oxygen utilization test brain energy store phosphorous level . We expect increase oxygen utilization structure exercise program associate increase phosphorous level . We expect increase either oxygen utilization phosphorous level MS cohort match sex baseline aerobic capacity participate non-aerobic stretch program duration intensity . Outcome measure : The primary outcome change brain phosphorous level MRI spectroscopy . The secondary outcome change oxygen utilization level , walk balance test , change cognitive function energy level . Methods : Participants enrol 1 year period . Potential subject undergo baseline exercise stress test oxygen utilization . Participants match sex baseline oxygen utilization level undergo baseline MRI spectroscopy study randomly assign either aerobic exercise program self-guided stretch program . The aerobic exercise program consist supervise 30 minute session either treadmill stationary bicycle exercise , 4 day per week 8 week . The self-guided home stretch program consist 30 minute session , 4 day week 8 week supervise session occur every 2 week . All participant undergo final exercise stress test MRI spectroscopy . Only participant match assign either exercise stretch group undergo MRI test receive payment participation .</detailed_description>
