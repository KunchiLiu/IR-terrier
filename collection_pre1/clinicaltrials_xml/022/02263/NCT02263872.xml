	<brief_title>Minocycline Adjunct Treatment Depressive Symptoms : Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder associate significant morbidity mortality . According WHO , depression lead cause disability worldwide term year lose due disability [ 1 ] . Although depressive symptom amenable antidepressant treatment , high proportion patient respond remit . For example Sequenced Treatment Alternatives Relief Depression ( STAR*D ) study response remission rate stage 1 treatment ( citalopram ) 49 % 37 % respectively rate decrease 16 % 13 % respectively subsequent next three treatment step [ 2 ] . Clearly need new treatment approach . Recently significant preclinical clinical study link inflammatory process range psychiatric illness include depression , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder Alzheimer 's disease . The evidence depression inflammatory relate disorder come multiple source . Depression associate raise inflammatory marker even absence medical illness [ 3 ] . More specifically depression associate high level positive acute phase protein ( APPs ) low level negative APPs [ 4 ] well increase level complement factor C3c C4 immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) IgG [ 5 ] . Inflammatory medical illness , CNS peripheral , associate great rate depression . In patient Crohns disease comorbid depression bouts physical disease activity tend co-occur depressive episode [ 6 ] . Finally , patient treat cytokine various illness increase risk develop depressive illness [ 7 ] . For example , treatment cytokine IFN-Î± lead development depressive symptom 45 % patient [ 8 ] . With mind would seem logical hypothesise addition anti-inflammatory medication may treatment option depressive illness . Muller et al [ 9 ] successful showing use Celcoxib addition Reboxetine treatment major depressive disorder double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled pilot study . Other study show TNF ( tumour necrosis factor ) block agent Infliximab Ethanercept improve mood independent improvement inflammatory condition [ 10 ] . However study find anti-inflammatory may fact antagonistic effect antidepressant action SSRIs [ 11 ] . Further work need area clarify role inflammatory process anti-inflammatory treatment depression . Alongside current interest use anti-inflammatory novel treatment psychiatric illness , antibiotic minocycline also propose treatment depressive symptom well negative symptom schizophrenia [ 12 , 13 ] . Preliminary data open label study patient psychotic unipolar depression also suggest minocycline augmentation antidepressant treatment effective well tolerate [ 14 ] . Minocycline pleiotropic agent exert effect multiple interacting symptom ( e.g . anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant , anti-apoptotic , anti-gutamatergic , monaminergic ) implicate pathophysiology mood disorder . Despite neuroprotective property , clinical trial date investigate antidepressant effect minocycline individual . The investigator previously show addition minocycline treatment usual early course schizophrenia lead predominant improvement negative symptom . In double blind randomise control pilot trial investigator aim determine efficacy minocycline adjunct treatment usual patient major depressive disorder . The investigator hypothesise multiple neuroprotective effect minocycline lead improvement depressive symptom participant give minocycline plus treatment usual . Aim To investigate whether addition minocycline treatment usual ( TAU ) 3 month patient major depressive disorder lead improvement depressive symptom compare TAU . Methods Double blind randomise , placebo-controlled pilot trial . The study conduct Karachi , Pakistan . Patients recruit psychiatric unit Karachi . All patient give write informed consent read information Urdu , witness almost always relative .</detailed_description>
