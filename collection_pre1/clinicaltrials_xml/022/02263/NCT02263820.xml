	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) recognize third common cause hospital acquire AKI , hypotension-associated hypo-perfusion post-operative AKI . The development CI-AKI cardiac catheterization associate significant increase short-term long-term mortality morbidity , well increase length stay cost . The marker renal function predictive ability creatinine significant limitation identify patient develop AKI . Therefore , diagnostic test predict CI-AKI risk would widespread clinical utility . The primary purpose study measure association baseline expression senescence marker blood use SenesceTest occurrence CI-AKI post cardiac catheterization .</brief_summary>
