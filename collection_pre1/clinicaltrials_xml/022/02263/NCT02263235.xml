	<brief_summary>In France , estimate 860 000 patient affected Alzheimer Disease ( AD ) represent , developed country , major public health issue . In many case , AD diagnosis uncertain clinical evolution unpredictable . The exactitude diagnosis however particularly important perspective validation use new therapeutic strategy AD . Detection cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) diagnosis biomarkers fell short detection , atypical/mixed case , differential diagnosis , differentiate rapid slow clinical evolution . Hence , CSF analysis give unique opportunity detect validate biomarkers many neurological disorder . Nevertheless , medical practice , CSF biological analysis currently limit small number analytes.Quantitative targeted mass spectrometry , especially operate Multiple reaction monitoring mode ( MRM ) , represent alternative immunodetection could use detect specific biomarkers complex matrix plasma specifically discriminate proteotypic peptide correspond protein . Mass spectrometry also ability distinguish quantify isotopically label unlabeled select target . This ability use publication group R. Bateman ( Washington University , St Louis , USA ) could , administer stable isotope-labelled leucine , evaluate Ab synthesis clearance human . This approach enormous potential study metabolism protein within human CNS consequently help understand diagnosis neurological disorders.The main objective program set target quantitative mass spectrometry method exist stable isotope-labelled CSF biomarkers neurological field ; exploit approach diagnostic purpurses gain knowledge pathophysiology disease .</brief_summary>
