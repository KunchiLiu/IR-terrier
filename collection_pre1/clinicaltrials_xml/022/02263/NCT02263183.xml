	<detailed_description>The oil palm Elaeis guineesis , source palm oil - 'tropical golden oil ' . Malaysia world 's large exporter golden oil . Triglycerides constitute major component crude palm oil , small proportion diglycerides monoglycerides . The oil also contain minor constituent , free fatty acid phytonutrients . This composition determine oil 's physical , chemical physiological characteristic . In food application , palm oil imparts functional property heat medium ( fry food ) spreadability ( formulation solid fat product like margarine shortening ) , also good source phytonutrients . Although phytonutrients constitute 1 % weight crude palm oil , main constituent palm oil exhibit nutritional property . Among major health promote property show associated various type phytonutrients present palm oil anti-cancer , cardio-protection anti-angiogenesis , cholesterol inhibition , brain development neuro-protective property , antioxidative defence mechanism , provitamin A activity anti-diabetes . Red palm oil ( RPO ) obtain crude palm oil novel low-temperature process . Owing special process , RPO possess special flavour aroma , rich phytonutrients include carotene ( thus give oil bright red colour ) , vitamin E , phytosterols , phospholipid , squalene , phenolic acid , flavonoid co-enzyme Q10 . Little known physiological effect red palm oil . The link dietary fat cardiovascular disease always controversial context palm oil . Narang et al. , 2004 demonstrate anti-oxidant vitamin palm olein play vital role protection rat 's heart oxidative stress induce ischemic-reperfusion injury . The unique isomeric position fatty acid presence tocotrienols cause endogenous cholesterol level drop . Besides palm oil could reduce risk arterial thrombosis atherosclerosis , inhibit endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis , platelet aggregation , reduce blood pressure . The composition palm oil unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratio close one rich antioxidant vitamin could attenuate progression salt-induced hypertension mortality rat modulation endothelial function reduction oxidative stress . In Chinese diet preparation , Zhang et al.,2003 demonstrate red palm oil good source carotenoid vitamin E , could significantly increase plasma concentration alpha-carotene , beta-carotene , lycopene alpha-tocopherol . Following chronic human study , Scholtz et al. , 2004 observe red palm olein less detrimental effect lipid profile decrease tissue plasminogen activator antigen compare palm olein . As red palm oil variety phytonutrients health benefit , potential improve cardiovascular health consider understand well thus treasure golden oil . The present study design investigate effect consumption red palm olein inflammatory metabolic risk marker</detailed_description>
