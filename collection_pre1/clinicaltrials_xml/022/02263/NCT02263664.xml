We propose prospective observational study determine effect transthoracic esophagectomy microcirculatory function . Two hundred patient meet inclusion criterion undergo plan transthoracic esophagectomy via thoracotomy incision prospectively enrol The University Virginia . Patients follow 28 day discharge ICU . Evaluation sublingual , gastric serosal mucosal tissue perform use sidestream dark field ( SDF ) image use CytoCam® Braedius Medical BV ( Huizen , The Netherlands ) . Scoring microcirculation include index vascular density ( perfused vessel density ) , assessment capillary perfusion ( proportion perfuse vessel microcirculatory flow index ) heterogeneity index . Note : CytoCam® take series image consistent microscope expose tissue . Also , FDA Office Device Evaluations ( ODE ) General Surgery Devices Branch One - Light Based/laser ( GSDB1 ) deem device exempt 510 ( K ) approval . http : //www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm ? ID=5021 Data patient 's medical chart surgery ( 30 day post ) use elucidation specific complication . We use cardiovascular respiratory component SOFA score independent measure organ dysfunction . Acute kidney injury define AKIN criterion increase least 50 % baseline serum creatinine grade stage 1 3 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Sublingual Microcirculatory Blood Flow Characteristics Patients Undergoing Transthoracic Esophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Provide scientific background , rationale relevance project . The microcirculation play fundamental role gas nutrient exchange ; must constantly adapt control vascular tone regional blood flow . In disease state , increase permeability may necessary produce inflammatory response . The assessment quantification macrovascular hemodynamics assumption reflective microvascular change fundamentally flaw . Even global hemodynamic variable correct , many patient circulatory failure develop multi organ failure ultimately die . The recent advent vivo microcirculation monitoring begin improve understand relationship surgery , anesthetic management , regulation microcirculation . Microcirculatory alteration also occur patient undergo cardiac surgery . Bauer et al first report microcirculatory perfusion transiently alter human cardiopulmonary bypass . Similar finding report recently group . , More importantly , alteration also observe patient undergo surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass.3 Furthermore sublingual microcirculation still slightly abnormal 24 h surgery patient . As non-cardiac surgery , severity perioperative microvascular alteration correlate peak lactate level severity organ dysfunction surgery.iii High-risk surgery new area vivo microcirculatory alteration observe . In patient undergo high-risk non-cardiac surgery , Jhanji et al observed density proportion perfuse capillary low 14 patient subsequently develop postoperative complication 11 patient uneventful postoperative course . Subcutaneous tissue PO2 laser Doppler cutaneous blood flow differ group , highlight lack sensitivity method detect heterogeneous perfusion . Interestingly , significant difference global O2 delivery group . Non-cardiac thoracic surgery comprise subgroup high risk surgical procedure potential significantly affect impair microcirculatory function . A study patient undergo esophagectomy demonstrate significant impairment sublingual microcirculation relative pancreaticoduodenectomy patient . Esophagectomy surgery produce profound systemic inflammatory response correlate number adverse outcome . Interestingly , time course microcirculatory impairment recovery appear parallel SIRS typically see surgery type . Transthoracic esophagectomy typically facilitate one lung ventilation ( OLV ) effort optimize surgical exposure operative hemithorax . The institution OLV potential dramatically impair tissue oxygen supply demand relationship via adverse effect systemic oxygen desaturation , result increase venous admixture right leave intrapulmonary shunting , well decrement cardiac output . Cerebral oxygen desaturation accompany OLV also well describe , though pathophysiology well understood . It likely , though unproven , microcirculatory derangement may underly phenomena . Though study microcirculatory dysfunction thoracic surgery infancy , body available evidence point support follow hypothesis ; microcirculatory derangement dysfunction 1 ) occur major surgery include transthoracic esophagectomy 2 ) may relate SIRS , OLV , 3 ) may predict adverse outcome , 4 ) may amenable modification via specific therapy . This feasibility study see change microcirculatory parameter observe SDF device accurately diagnose anastomotic complication purpose lead wider study microcirculatory derangement indicator risk surgical complication . Hypothesis Tested : i. Microcirculatory derangement , indicate change microcirculation sublingual tissue , serosa tunica near surgical division , mucosal line stomach near surgical division , occur transthoracic esophagectomy perioperative period . ii . Changes microcirculation predict post-operative anastomotic complication iii . Changes microcirculation predict post-operative complication Specific Aims 1 . Determine whether microcirculatory derangement , indicate change microcirculation sublingual tissue , serosa tunica near surgical division , mucosal line stomach near surgical division , occur transthoracic esophagectomy involve one lung ventilation ( OLV ) , use side stream dark field ( SDF ) image system . 1.1 . This aim include measurement microcirculatory parameter multiple time point within perioperative period . 2 . Determine temporal relationship microcirculatory dysfunction recovery , , initiation OLV , reestablishment two lung ventilation , cessation surgery . 2.1 . This aim include measurement microcirculatory parameter multiple time point within perioperative period . 3 . Determine whether observed change microcirculation predictive postoperative organ dysfunction , perioperative complication .</detailed_description>
