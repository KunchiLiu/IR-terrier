	<brief_summary>Participants person type 2 diabetes likely fatty liver disease . The investigator think medication reduce fatty liver . The investigator use MRS ( non invasive method use magnet ) evaluate liver fat subject take diabetes medication . The investigator also collect small amount blood measure liver , kidney hormone function . This do 4 time . Also , time subject get first dose medication DEXA ( low exposure x-ray often use clinical practice measure bone density body composition ) . The goal study determine whether study drug lower liver fat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation DPP-4 Inhibitor Sitagliptin Treatment Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) progression non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) finally cirrhosis rapidly become lead cause liver injury end stage liver disease , particularly industrialized country . Though several pharmacologic agent ( i.e . metformin , pioglitazone others ) suggest benefit reduce progression disease , none approve use . The cause NAFLD NASH unknown , though visceral obesity , metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes recognize co-existent risk factor . Recent evidence link NAFLD elevate dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . DPP-4 level plasma liver person NAFLD elevate correlate elevation liver enzymes , though marker insulin resistance alone . It propose increased DPP-4 activity combination decrease PPAR signal stimulates inflammatory response lead liver fibrosis transition NASH cirrhosis . Debate exist whether effect DPP-4 liver via effect intestinal hormone direct effect liver tissue . Indeed study find reduction liver fat administration GLP-1 agonists animal model obesity .</detailed_description>
