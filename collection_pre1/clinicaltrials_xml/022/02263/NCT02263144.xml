	<detailed_description>1 . In order create video-library endoscopic case , patient undergo screen diagnostic colonoscopy consider inclusion . Patients least one histologically verify &lt; 10 mm polyp include . A short video-clip ( around 15-20 second ) polyp white-light FICE-light record store anonymized database . 2 . Once video-library complete , 7 expert independently review case . For case , observer assess three NICE criterion ( colour/vascularization/surface ) , degree confidence ( low/high ) , classify lesion neoplastic non-neoplastic . The primary outcome accuracy FICE technology high-definition without magnification , adopt NICE classification , differentiate hyperplastic adenomatous lesion , inter-observer agreement differentiation . Secondary end-points assess multivariate measure role individual criterion NICE classification discrimination two histotypes , possible adaptation NICE classification order apply FICE .</detailed_description>
