	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether consumption thiamin fortify fish sauce 6 month increase thiamin status woman level consistent low risk infantile beriberi . The investigator hypothesize consumption thiamin-fortified fish sauce increase red blood cell thiamin concentration , indicator thiamin status , woman consume thiamin-fortified fish sauce , concentration change woman consume placebo fish sauce contain thiamin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thiamin Fortified Fish Sauce Means Combating Infantile Beriberi Rural Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose The purpose three-armed , double blind randomize control trial determine whether thiamin-fortified fish sauce efficacious mean increase dietary thiamin intake Cambodian woman level increase erythrocyte thiamin diphosphate ( TDP ) concentration level consistent low risk infantile beriberi . Two group woman participate study : woman childbearing age ( 18-45y ; n=270 ) , pregnant woman ( 18-45y ; ~26 week pregnant baseline ; n=90 ) . Hypothesis Intervention thiamin-fortified fish sauce increase woman 's TDP concentration level consistent low risk infantile beriberi compare receive control fish sauce . Study Justification Beriberi micronutrient deficiency disease cause lack thiamin ( vitamin B1 ) diet . Infantile beriberi common Southeast Asia . Beriberi , disease cause severe thiamin deficiency , rare west think common develop country , particularly Southeast Asia . In infant , beriberi present symptoms heart failure fatal unless thiamin treatment initiate immediately . Beriberi typically present exclusively breastfed infant whose mother suboptimal thiamin status consequently low breast milk thiamin concentration . Maternal thiamin deficiency Cambodia likely result multiple factor : high consumption white , polished rice , remove B-vitamin-containing husk , lack parboiling rice , low dietary diversity . Improving thiamin status pregnant lactate woman essential combat infantile beriberi . Fortification food staple proven successful strategy increase population level thiamin 'passive ' intervention , require little behavior change . Fish sauce ideal vehicle thiamin fortification : consume daily consistently high quantity , produce centralized plant , successfully use Cambodia Vietnam vehicle iron fortification . Research Method All villages Prey Veng province already involve active intervention ( example , homestead food production , micronutrient powder intervention etc ) randomize . A Khmer-speaking research assistant contact Village Chief and/or Village Health Volunteer first village randomized list determine number eligible woman childbearing age pregnant woman ( ~26 week ) village . The research assistant move randomize list village 360 participant enrol . The investigator expect enrolment approximately 10 village . A trained , Khmer-speaking enumerator conduct interview participant home . The questionnaire collect demographic data , well information dietary intake ( include fish sauce ) , thought perception fortify product , knowledge thiamin deficiency beriberi . Once questionnaire complete participant walk interviewer central meeting spot within village ( typically Village Chief 's home ) complete anthropometric measurement ( height weight ) . The next morning participant travel local health centre non-fasted blood draw . Once participant completes baseline questionnaire , anthropometrics , blood collection randomly assign one three treatment group : low concentration thiamin-iron-fortified fish sauce ( 2mg thiamin/mL fish sauce + iron ) , high concentration thiamin-fortified fish sauce ( 8mg thiamin/mL fish sauce + iron ) , placebo : iron-fortified fish sauce . The bottle label three fish sauce identical appearance , except code differentiates sauce . All participant visit biweekly monitoring evaluation fish sauce consumption . Fish sauce distribute visit ensure 'stock out ' fish sauce study . Within first month study participant attend educational workshop training regard dietary thiamin intake , thiamin deficiency beriberi , infant young child feeding ( IYCF ) practice . Anthropometric measurement ( weight length ) take within 72 hour birth participant 's infant ( t~3 month ) . At t~4 month , subset household ( n=28 ) participate Observed Weighed Fish Sauce Record wherein train enumerator measure fish sauce consume participant throughout one day . Two repeat observe weighed fish sauce record complete within 2 week period . At endline ( t=6 month ) , questionnaire , anthropometrics , blood draw repeat woman . The investigator also collect venous blood sample ( 4mL ) infant , breast milk sample mother pregnant cohort . Investigators plan analyze sample within two month endline sample collection , return village share study finding participant community meeting ( general result share ) , separately share individual thiamin result one-on-one . All participant already participate educational workshop highlight importance dietary thiamin intake , sign thiamin deficiency beriberi . Individuals suboptimal thiamin status encourage speak healthcare provider , also counsel use material previously use educational workshop .</detailed_description>
