	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine Multi Myeloma ( MM ) patient mobilize granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) plus plerixafor 240 μg/kg likely achieve target number great equal 6 x 10^6 cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ cells/kg 2 few day apheresis MM patient mobilize G-CSF alone . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety G-CSF plus plerixafor arm compare G-CSF arm MM patient . - To compare 2 treatment arm respect number participant achieve minimum 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 4 few day apheresis . - To compare 2 treatment arm respect number day apheresis required reach target great equal 6 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg .</brief_summary>
