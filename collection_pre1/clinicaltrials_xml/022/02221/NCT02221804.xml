	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) common pulmonary disease , responsible considerable morbidity mortality third lead cause death worldwide . As well consequence lung , COPD well recognize associate range important systemic consequence co-morbidities . Interestingly , skeletal muscle dysfunction note early advanced disease , suggest origin may wholly pulmonary . Treatment strategies target lung function , unfortunately , limited value . Given burden disease , become increasingly important investigative therapeutic work focus systemic characteristic sequelae define disease phenotype . This randomize controlled trial effect 14 day voluntary reduced activity muscle mass , muscle strength , body composition , atrophy signal patient COPD age-matched control . The primary hypothesis upon study base short reduction ambulation induce transient reduction quadriceps muscle mass , quadriceps strength physical performance patient COPD compare match COPD patient whose mobility restrict . The secondary hypothesis magnitude change great physically inactive COPD patient compare physically inactive age-matched control . The overall aim research use vivo human model 14 day voluntary reduce physical activity test hypothesis . If model prove feasible , allow early proof concept study novel therapeutic agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Two Weeks Voluntary Reduced Physical Activity Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-commercial randomized control trial . 15 patient COPD 15 age-matched control voluntarily reduce daily step-count 1500 steps/day , baseline &gt; 3500 steps/day . Before 14 day reduce daily step-count , 30 participant undergo measure appendicular mass , quadriceps strength , exercise tolerance blood urinary biomarkers . Quadriceps muscle biopsy also take 14-day intervention . 15 patient COPD study 14 day apart undergo intervention .</detailed_description>
