	<detailed_description>Gliomas frequent primary neoplasm CNS accord World Health Organization histologically categorize low-grade glioma ( LGG ) ( WHO grade I/II ) high-grade glioma ( HGG ) ( WHO grade III/IV ) . Gliomas among big challenge within field neuro-rehabilitation oncology , optimise treatment improve QoL , function cognition major clinical importance population . Because majority patient cure , clinical cancer research traditionally focus prolong survival , expose relapse optimise response medical treatment . Today general consensus health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) important evaluation new treatment . However , research HRQoL among patient gliomas scarce compare category patient tumor . In recent year exercise become important part cancer treatment . The effect well documented study among cancer patient gliomas include improvement quality life , physical function , reduce fatigue thereby support daily activity among cancer patient ' . Inpatient rehabilitation study among glioma patient also indicate improved HRQoL functional measurement activity daily life , mobility cognition . Despite rehabilitation effort still emphasize population recent literature conclude well-designed clinical study examine effect multidisciplinary rehabilitation among Glioma patient . This study first investigate effect intensive specialise interdisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation program among gliomas patient .</detailed_description>
