Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure result permanent implant perform within 30 day Implanted heart valve prosthesis , prosthetic valve ring , severe（ &gt; 3＋）mitral valve insufficiency Blood dyscrasia leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 3×109/L ) , acute anemia ( Hgb &lt; 90 g/L ) , thrombocytopenia ( PLT &lt; 50×109/L ) , bleed diathesis , history coagulopathy . Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease require revascularization Hemodynamic instability require mechanical cardiac assist mechanical hemodynamic support device Need emergency surgery reason Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without obstruction Severe ventricular dysfunction LVEF ( Left ventricular ejection fraction ) &lt; 20 % Echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation Active peptic ulcer upper gastrointestinal bleeding within prior 3 month A know hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , ticlopidine , clopidogrel , Nitinol , sensitivity contrast medium adequately premedicated . Native aortic annulus size &lt; 17 mm &gt; 29 mm . Patient refuse aortic valve replacement surgery . Cerebrovascular Accident ( CVA ) within 6 month , include TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ) and/or end stage renal disease require chronic dialysis . Life expectancy &lt; 12 month Significant abdominal thoracic aorta disease , include aneurysm , mark tortuosity ( hyperacute bend ) , aortic arch atheroma , narrow abdominal aorta ( especially calcification surface irregularity ) , severe `` unfolding '' tortuosity thoracic aorta Iliofemoral vessel characteristic would preclude safe placement 16F 19F introducer sheath severe obstructive calcification , severe tortuosity Active bacterial endocarditis active infection .
