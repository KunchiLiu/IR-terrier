	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction The increase rate emergency caesarean section develop country great concern associate adverse outcome mother infant . The rate caesarean section first time mother singleton foetus vertex position spontaneous onset labour term increase 5.7 % 9.2 % Norway . The common indication emergency caesarean section Labour dystocia , even consensus criterion diagnosis . Labour dystocia characterise abnormally slow progress labour among common challenge birth care especially first time mother . When labour progression assess prolonged accord current guideline , labour dystocia treat amniotomy follow oxytocin infusion augment uterus contraction . Oxytocin potent drug classify Institute Safe Medication Practices USA one 12 medication `` bearing heighten risk harm '' . In Norway guideline expect progression labour base modification Friedman 's curve cervical dilatation , linear labour progression curve develop 1953 . Contemporary research Zhang show dilatation cervix substantially slow earlier expect , especially early stage labour . Hypothesis : By adhere guideline labour progression present Zhang , rate emergency caesarean section first time mother decrease compare adhere guideline labour progression base modify Friedman 's curve , without jeopardise maternal neonatal outcome . 2 . Background status knowledge Traditionally labour process divide two stage ; first stage second stage . The first stage divide two phase ; latent phase active phase , latent phase define onset labour cervix dilate four centimetre 3-4 painful contraction per ten minute . The active phase define cervix dilatation four centimetre fully dilate . The second stage divide two phase ; deceleration phase baby 's head decelerating towards pelvic floor expulsion phase mother actively push baby . To visualize progression labour , status cervix dilatation traditionally measure record throughout labour graphic curve often call partogram . The partogram widely use internationally facilitate midwife ' doctor ' monitor labour progression , together criterion labour dystocia , consequently carry necessary intervention . In 1954 Dr. Friedman present first progression curve base examination 100 first time mother . Friedman 's curve widely adopt applied practice internationally almost 60 year . In 2002 Dr. Zhang present new labour curve base labour data 1329 low-risk woman . Zhang 's finding confirm large cohort 26,838 woman 2010 . Zhang 's labour curve differs markedly Friedman 's curve cervix dilate substantially slow , especially reach six centimetre dilatation , distinct deflection curve nine ten centimetres Friedman 's curve find Zhang 's curve . These finding may suggest diagnostic criterion labour dystocia stringent follow Friedman 's curve contemporary birth care . A new guideline normal birth progression develop accord Zhang 's curve contemporary research finding . The new guideline differs exist one expect linear progression define progression normal speed cervical dilatation within 95 percentile duration Zhang 's material . Active labour define cervical dilatation 4 centimetre baby bear . In dynamic labour curve , labour dystocia define time 4 5 cm exceeds six hour 30 minute , time 5 6 cm exceeds three hour 15 minute , time 6 7 cm exceeds two hour 15 minute , time 7 8 cm exceed one hour 30 minute , time 8 9 cm exceed one hour 30 minute time 9 10 cm exceed one hour 45 minute . New knowledge competence labour progression may result new guideline allow low-risk labour proceed without unnecessary intervention benefit population medically economically . 3 . Design implementation To evaluate hypothesis true , cluster randomise trial conduct . The objective include birth care unit randomise adhere either two guideline active labour ; F ( Standard care accord Friedman 's guideline ) Z ; ( Experimental care accord Zhang 's guideline ) F = Guideline follow expect labour progression : cervix dilate least 1 centimetre per hour assess 4 hour . Labour dystocia diagnose progression proceeds slow definition throughout active phase first stage labour . Labour dystocia second stage labour diagnose lasting long two hour , three hour woman epidural expulsion phase last longer 60 minute . This guideline base interpretation Friedman 's expect progression labour . Z = Guideline take account dilatation cervix admission calculates expect progression active phase first stage labour base finding . Labour dystocia second stage labour diagnose lasting long two hour 45 minute , three hour 30 minute woman epidural expulsion phase last longer 60 minute . This guideline base labour progression curve Zhang . Fourteen cluster include . The choice cluster randomising , due risk contamination randomise individual level . Key element specify regard allocation treatment : The method generate allocation sequence computer-generated , allocation ratio equal one , type randomisation restrict factor `` size birth care unit '' `` prior rate caesarean section first time mother singleton foetus vertex position , spontaneous onset labour term '' use stratification . The randomisation process perform central computer assist programme . The trial conduct accord CONSORT statement plan implementation cluster randomise trial . All cluster receive concise edition trial protocol sign cooperation agreement . Each cluster must also provide one dedicate person ( local coordinator ) responsible trial inclusion period . The local coordinator responsible recruitment inclusion participant , monitor entry web-Case Report Form ( web-CRF ) , record control participant responsible implementation trial . For included cluster , follow criterion must meet : Birth care unit willing adhere guideline trial period consider capacity participate logistical practical . The size birth care unit 500 delivery per year secure reasonable inclusion period . Statistical method data analysis : The determination sample size base power calculation least occurring outcome ; emergency caesarean section , 9.2 % study population ( p1 ) . Further , expect emergency caesarean section rate 6.7 % ( p2 ) id 25 % reduction , use new guideline . With chosen significance level 0.05 , power 80 % p1=9.2 % p2=6.9 % , include least 14 cluster 6582 individual . As test new guideline , blind care giver possible . The statistician perform analysis blind participant 's affiliation group control analysis . Analysis : The difference randomize group present Risk Ratio ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . For dichotomous efficacy variable significance test take account cluster structure data , use . For continuous data independent sample t-test use . Statistical analysis conduct use STATA version 10.1 StataCorp , Texas , //845 USA SPSS version 18 . The analysis conduct accord principle intention treat . Implementation All first time mother singleton foetus vertex position , spontaneous onset labour term adhere labour progression guideline cluster randomise . All eligible participant receive write information trial call routine ultrasound control , routine ultrasound control labour ward . They ask sign inform consent permit data include analysis , answer on-line questionnaire childbirth experience . Safety assessment : All woman arm care monitored accord procedure birth care unit . Necessary intervention due mother 's fetus ' need , conduct regardless allocate guideline labour progression . Web-Case Report Form : Due different system electronic medical record due additional handwritten record , web base Case Report Form ( web-CRF ) design Unit Applied Clinical Research Faculty Medicine Norwegian University Science Technology , NTNU . The web-CRF transferable analytical tool ; STATA SPSS . The local coordinator ensure data require protocol enter de-identified web-CRF . The local coordinator also responsible assure data enter web-CRF complete , accurate , entry perform timely manner . The signature local coordinator attest accuracy data web-CRF . Consecutively assessment record electronic journal throughout labour , assessment record printed version partogram transmit web-CRF birth care unit . Assessments record throughout labour e.g . : Cervix status admission ( centimetre ) , result regularly vaginal exploration , use oxytocin , pain relief additional intervention . The trial manager shall arrange secure retention participant identification code list . Participant file shall keep maximum period time permit birth care unit . The trial documentation ( web-CRF , Site File etc . ) shall retain store trial 10 year trial closure . All information concern trial store safe place inaccessible unauthorized personnel . Investigator Delegation Procedure : The trial manager responsible make updating `` delegation task '' list involve co-worker role project . The principle investigator ensure appropriate training relevant study give staff , new information relevance performance trial forward staff involve . All significant protocol deviation record report Clinical Study Report ( CSR ) . If necessary study protocol amend , amendment and/or new version trial protocol ( Amended Protocol ) must notify approved Competent Authority Ethics Committees accord EU national regulation . Audit Inspections : Authorized representative Competent Authority Ethics Committee may visit centre perform inspection , include source data verification . The purpose inspection systematically independently examine study-related activity document determine whether activity conduct , data record , analyse , accurately report accord protocol , Good Clinical Practice , applicable regulatory requirement . The principal investigator ensure inspector auditor provide access source data/documents . Publication policy : All personnel contribute significantly plan performance study accord Vancouver convention 1988 may include list Ethical regulatory requirement : The trial conduct accordance ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki consistent Good Clinical Practice applicable regulatory requirement . Registration participant 's data carry accordance national personal data law .
