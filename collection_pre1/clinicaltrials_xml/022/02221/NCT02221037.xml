	<brief_summary>Lung injury patient undergo oesophagectomy may occur surgery ( peri-operatively ) result One Lung Ventilation ( OLV ) and/or immediate post-operative period patient receive intensive care . This reinforced observation physiological marker lung injury elevate immediately completion surgery , development clinical Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) occur immediately post-operatively ( within 72 hour surgery ) , majority case report 24-48 hour completion surgery . This study design investigate impact pre-operative administration GSK2862277 biological physiological marker lung injury patient undergoing surgical resection oesophageal cancer order achieve optimal exposure site injury follow OLV lung deflation . This study randomize placebo control , double-blind , multi-centre , single dose parallel group , design . There two treatment group comprise one active one placebo arm approximately 40 patient per group . Patients enrol study schedule undergo planned/elective trans-thoracic surgery oesophagectomy . The primary endpoint study change pulmonary vascular permeability index ( PVPI ) pre-surgical level end surgery . GSK2862277 administer orally inhale aerosol ( single nebulized dose ) approximately 3 5 minute ( min ) 1-3 hour prior surgery . Subject monitor daily discharge follow till day 28 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject plan elective transthoracic oesophagectomy Male female 18 80 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliInternational Units per milliliter estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter ( &lt; 147 picomoles per liter ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Liver parameter accord threshold : Aspartate aminotransferase Alanine aminotransferase &lt; 5x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; = 480 millisecond ( msec ) screen Either QTcB QTcF , machine manual overread use . This apply males female . The QT correction formula use determine inclusion discontinuation individual subject throughout study . Based average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period . Positive screen test preexisting antibody bind GSK2862277 . Current evidence history pneumonia within 14 day dose . Diagnosis chronic respiratory disease force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) less 50 % predict rest oxygen saturation less 92 % . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . The subject receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Use corticosteroid ( Intravenous , oral Intramuscular ) dose &gt; = 10 Milligrams per day ( mg/day ) prednisolone ( equivalent ) within 14 day prior dose , antiTumor Necrosis Factor ( antiTNF ) antiIL1 within 60 day prior dose . Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories History current evidence clinically significant renal disease , diabetes mellitus/metabolic syndrome , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease clinically significant respiratory , cardiovascular , neurological , endocrine , hematological abnormality uncontrolled permitted therapy . Significant define disease , opinion Investigator , would put safety patient risk study participation , would affect safety analysis analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study , define : average weekly intake &gt; 28 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram alcohol : halfpint [ ~240 milliliter ( ml ) ] beer , 1 glass ( 125 ml ) wine 1 ( 25 ml ) measure spirit Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments Screens positive Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C antibody Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive ; test conduct accordance local procedure Tests positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis use QuantiFERON Gold Test . Other Criteria Subject receive live attenuate vaccine ( ) within 3 week randomisation require vaccination live attenuate vaccine prior end study ( Day 28 ) . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Subject mentally legally incapacitate .</criteria>
