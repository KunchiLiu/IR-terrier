	<brief_title>The Effect Early Versus Traditional Follow-Up Breastfeeding Rates 6 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study non-blinded randomize control trial intent treat analysis intend determine whether early ( 2-3 week postpartum-experimental arm ) versus traditional ( 6-8 week postpartum-control arm ) follow increase breastfeed rate 6 month ' postpartum . For purpose study , breastfeed define breast milk produce mother feed infant ( whether place infant breast pumping/expressing milk feed infant another way ) . A literature search fail identify study evaluate benefit shortcoming exclusive short interval postpartum visit instead 6-8 week traditionally time visit . Although may practical reason delay postpartum follow 6-8 week delivery , good data support , may remain dominant practice due solely convention . Recent expert opinion suggest early postpartum follow may practical provide early convenient opportunity provide assessment education postpartum woman [ 9 ] . Earlier follow may present timely opportunity discuss family planning , breastfeeding , screen depression . Pierce CountyWomen/Infants/Children Program ( WIC ) data indicate 34 % breastfeed rate military beneficiary population 6 month ' postpartum ( 2012 data ) . Using sample size 166 exposure non-exposure arm would allow detection 50 % increase outcome exposure arm use two-sided test α = 0.05 β = 0.20 . A 50 % increase rate breastfeed 6 month ' postpartum ( 34 % 51 % ) would clinically significant increase approximate Surgeon General 's 2020 goal 60.6 % rate breastfeed 6 month . We assume 30 % dropout rate , therefore , plan recruit total 346 patient study . Potential enrollee evaluate , recruit , enrol use process describe 6.2.3 ( b ) . A screening enrollment log track patient review eligibility whether meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , , whether participation study accept decline . Patients agree enroll sign require study consent complete breastfeed attrition prediction tool ( BAPT ) . With subject 's assistance , enrol investigator complete demographic sheet . Once item complete , randomization occur . Randomization via computer-generated block randomization block size six . Randomization block perform use RAND function Excel . Randomization perform study 's collaborating staff , direct contact potential subject . Treatment `` A '' represent follow 2-3 week postpartum . Treatment `` B '' represent follow 6-8 week postpartum . The randomized assignment denote either `` Treatment A : 2-3 week follow '' `` Treatment B : 6-8 week follow '' place card within sequentially number , seal , opaque envelope collaborate staff . The randomization process , card , envelope preparation complete collaborating staff without involvement study investigator . These sequentially number sealed envelope secure Labor Delivery study investigator allocate envelope enrollee . Once patient agrees enrollment , require demographic screening tool complete study consent form sign , box contain sequentially number sealed envelope open study investigator patient give next envelope sequence . Prior open envelope , study investigator denote enrollment log date subject enrollment sequence number envelope assign subject . The envelope number assign subject study number . The subject open assign envelope determine treatment assignment , study investigator denote study arm assignment enrollment log . Once assigned treatment arm , screen enrollment log designate treatment assignment use coordinate clerk Ob/Gyn Clinic , contact subject schedule postpartum follow allot interval . The scheduled appointment provider ( nurse practitioner nurse midwife ) associate study . At postpartum visit , subject complete return postpartum questionnaire , along Edinburgh perinatal depression screen , standard screening complete postpartum patient . Subjects demonstrate elevated depression screen follow assessed accord previously approve departmental protocol ( MAMC Perinatal Screening Program Algorithm ) . Subjects fail show assign follow interval include 6-month postpartum assessment . Subjects return follow interval outside assign appointment interval also contact 6- month follow include originally assign group data analysis ( intent-to-treat ) . When patient 5-6 month ' postpartum , study investigator telephonically contact subject obtain answer 6-month postpartum questionnaire . The questionnaire review standardized script . A multitude factor influence breastfeed success mother choose breastfeed . Some factor include prior breastfeeding experience , maternal fetal medical complication , social support , attitude , education , age , race , demographic factor , well maternal-fetal proximity within immediate postpartum period . To minimize potential confounders bias , aim enroll primiparous mother , mother unlikely prior breastfeeding experience . Demographic information collect used perform subset analysis evaluate homogeneity two study group . The standardized assessment tool use characterize maternal attitude support breastfeeding also use subset analysis . Some neonate unable mother immediately birth due variety issue may warrant observation Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , case , due maternal illness . We also exclude mother whose infant rooming-in continuously first 48 hour postpartum , may pose potential barrier initiate breastfeeding . To ensure study generalizable , include mother spontaneous operative delivery , well cesarean delivery , constitute approximately 16 % ( nulliparous term singleton vertex cesarean birth rate facility 2012 ) primiparous birth facility , long inclusion/exclusion criterion meet . Additionally , patient may present enhance follow ( case complicate delivery postpartum complication ) acute visit within first 8 week ' postpartum . These visit represent opportunity outside typical postpartum follow appointment mother seek evaluation breastfeed support concern . We collect data number type schedule unscheduled provider encounter occur within medical system outside schedule postpartum follow appointment . Furthermore , subject may fail follow assign interval . Data analysis via intent-to-treat , therefore , subject assign one arm either fail follow assign interval follow frequently still evaluate assessed primary outcome . 1 . Describe happen study EXPERIMENTAL : Subjects experimental arm ( 2-3 week postpartum follow ) postpartum appointment earlier interval current consider standard care . All study participant complete BAPT . Demographic data obtain subject prior discharge . All subject also complete standardize postpartum questionnaire schedule postpartum visit ( either 2-3 week 6-8 week depend arm study ) . All subject 6-month follow via standardized/scripted phone survey . 2 . Describe happen study STANDARD CARE : The control arm trial assign traditional 6-8 week postpartum visit . All study subject receive postpartum follow care .</detailed_description>
