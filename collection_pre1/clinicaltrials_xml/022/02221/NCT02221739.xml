	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effective safe combination radiation therapy investigational medication target immune system know Ipilimumab treatment metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The investigator would like see combination radiation Ipilimumab stimulate body 's immune system stop growth tumor outside field radiation . The investigator would like see use combination radiation therapy Ipilimumab could help body reject patient 's tumor least help immune system maintain disease stable and/or slow growth . Radiation therapy ( RT ) currently standard procedure treatment NSCLC . Ipilimumab consider investigational medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment NSCLC . Ipilimumab approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combined Ionizing Radiation Ipilimumab Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis : 1 . Through combination local RT ipilimumab anti-tumor immune response elicit irradiated site , vivo , individualized immunization systemically effective , reflect objective response outside RT field ( abscopal effect ) . 2 . The immune response prospectively monitor among treated patient . Objective 1 : Evaluate safety therapeutic efficacy anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein -4 mono clonal Antibody ( anti-CTLA-4 mAb ) concurrent local RT NSCLC patient metastatic disease . An open label phase II trial evaluate preliminary efficacy combination Ipi RT , apply single metastatic site . Efficacy measure respect systemic tumor response ( abscopal response , outside field therapy ) define immune-related Response Criteria ( irRC ) non-irradiated measurable lesion , demonstration effective anti-tumor immune response . Secondary endpoint include local response RT treat tumor , progression free survival , overall survival . Objective 2 : Determine effect RT anti-CTLA-4 mAb development anti-tumor immunity . The investigator hypothesize RT convert irradiate tumor situ vaccine elicit endogenous tumor-specific cellular humoral immune response , presence cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) blockade promote immune-mediated destruction irradiate abscopal metastasis . Pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy examine change immune contexture , blood evidence emerge anti-tumor immune response . Associations clinical response explore .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document ; 2 . Histologic diagnosis metastatic NSCLC ; 3 . Any Kras EGFR status permit ; 4 . Patients must least two distinct measurable metastatic site , one least 1 cm large large diameter . Patients may additional nonmeasurable metastatic lesion ( e.g. , bone metastasis ) ; 5 . Patients must prior treatment least one line therapy metastatic NSCLC . Any prior therapy permit except prior therapy ipilimumab ; 6 . An interval 2 week last previous therapy require ; 7 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define initial laboratory test : WBC ≥ 2000/uL ANC ≥ 1000/uL Platelets ≥ 50 x 103/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 3.0 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present . Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL ) ; 8 . Performance status ECOG 01 ; 9 . Men woman , age &gt; 18 year age ; 10 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month ; 11 . Patients may brain metastasis stable least 4 week , great 2 week post gamma knife therapy patient steroid dependent ; 12 . Brain Scan ( CT/MRI ) prior enrollment 13 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 8 week last dose Ipi . 1 . Patients lesion outside field radiation thus nullify ability measure abscopal effect ; 2 . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease exclude study patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , progressive systemic sclerosis [ scleroderma ] ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's granulomatosis ] ; 3 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation adverse event ( AEs ) , condition associate frequent diarrhea ; 4 . Concomitant therapy following : Interleukin2 ( IL2 ) , interferon nonstudy immunotherapy regimen ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ; 5 . Prior therapy ipilimumab another antiCTLA4 antagonist ; 6 . Women unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 8 week cessation study drug , positive pregnancy test baseline , pregnant breastfeeding ; 7 . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious ) illness .</criteria>
