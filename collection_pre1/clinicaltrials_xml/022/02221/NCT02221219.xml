	<brief_summary>Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) brain lesion commonly occur preterm infant well-recognized major contributor long-term brain injury relate disability later life . Despite prevalence , long term consequence , enormous medical social cost , mechanism IVH optimal strategy prevent treat occurrence poorly define , especially extremely premature infant . Only one medical therapy , prophylactic indomethacin first 3 day life , show prevent decrease severity IVH preterm infant , use limit toxic side effect debatable effect long-term outcome . Several small study case report suggest delay umbilical cord-clamping ( DCC ) may also decrease incidence IVH premature infant , thus far trial indomethacin treatment mixed within cord clamping protocol . The investigator conduct randomize , blind investigation 4 treatment group : 1 ) Control ( intervention ) ; 2 ) DCC alone ; 3 ) Prophylactic indomethacin alone ; 4 ) Combination DCC/indomethacin , respect survival , IVH PVL incidence severity , neurodevelopmental outcome , relevant mechanistic effect . With steady rise extreme prematurity birth clear link IVH long-term disability need improve care patient . This multi- disciplinary project address important medical problem understudied patient population , current practice clear limitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator compare efficacy safety prophylactic indomethacin , DCC , combination , affect incidence severity IVH/PVL infant &lt; 30wks gestational age ( primary outcome measure 'fraction survivor severe IVH PVL ' among 4 group ) , long term neurocognitive function . Other secondary endpoint investigation include mechanistic effect prophylactic indomethacin , DCC , combination ( blood volume/circulatory status , inflammatory stress , progenitor cell ) well define relationship clinical outcome mechanistic measurement among treatment group ( n=400 total case ) .</detailed_description>
