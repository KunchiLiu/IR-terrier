	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit approximately 56 aged individual vitamin D insufficiency 13 week trial . All subject 60 year age old . Participants randomize one four group : vitamin D ( 50,000IU/wk ) + aerobic training ( 7 day 13th week ) ; vitamin D ( 50,000IU/wk ) + normal daily activity 13th week ; placebo + aerobic training ( 7 day 13th week ) ; placebo + normal daily activity 13th week . Following screen informed consent process physical activity questionnaire administer . A blood draw conduct baseline , midpoint endpoint . Collected blood purpose study assess vitamin D status ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , parathyroid hormone , ionized calcium , insulin , comprehensive metabolic panel . At baseline endpoint muscle lipid assess use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy muscle oxygen consumption determine use novel hybrid diffuse optical instrument consist near-infrared spectroscopy diffuse correlation spectroscopy . In addition , study time point 3 dietary recall complete physical activity measure use accelerometer .</detailed_description>
