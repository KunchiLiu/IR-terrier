	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular edema refers swell ( fluid accumulation ) center retina . The retina like film camera locate back eye . This condition develop diabetic swell result leak fluid blood vessel eye , center retina , macula . If leave untreated , affect central vision . The current standard treatment diabetic macular edema include medication inject directly eye ( intravitreal injection ) laser eye treatment . The drug inject directly eye know anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( anti-VEGF ) agent help reduce leak . This include bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) . However , patient respond well anti-VEGF treatment give option switch another class medication , call steroid . Triamcinolone acetonide one steroid also inject directly eye . These steroid help reduce inflammation possibly consequence , reduce swell eye . The purpose study determine cellular factor affect patient 's treatment response ( amount swell reduction ) follow triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal injection diabetic macular edema .</brief_summary>
