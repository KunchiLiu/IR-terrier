	<brief_summary>Technological advance make computer aid orthodontic treatment plan possible . 3D dental scanner software make possible design approve outcome treatment begin . Manufacturers provide different customized appliance system would help practitioner achieve computer-designed outcome . The purpose study determine accuracy computer-guided indirect bonding orthodontic bracket achieve predict alignment compare accuracy conventional orthodontic bracket placement achieve predetermined goal . The result study help orthodontist patient know advantage use custom appliance . The study prospective clinical study include total 60 arch 30 patient enrolled Harvard School Dental Medicine . 15 patient assign two study group ( Motion View control ) . Both group 3D intra-oral scan measure initial discrepancy determine computer-simulated design orthodontist believe optimize outcome . At end patient 's participation , 3D intraoral scan take used assess intra-arch leveling alignment use ABO 's objective grading system 's criterion alignment , marginal ridge buccolingual inclination . Each arch superimpose predict outcome determine accurate system achieve plan movement 3 dimension . We hypothesize accuracy computer-guided indirect bonding ( Motion View ) achieve predict outcome differ comparison accuracy conventional orthodontic bracket placement achieve predetermined goal .</brief_summary>
