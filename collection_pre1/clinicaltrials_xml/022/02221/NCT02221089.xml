	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress implicate play pathogenic role many disease process , especially age-related disorder age-related macular degeneration . It hypothesize antioxidative agent vitamins mineral , capable scavenge free radical , may reduce oxidative stress may , turn , beneficial patient age-related disorder . Based hypothesis several different combination vitamin introduce , target reduce oxidative stress . However , in-vivo effect antioxidative property certain drug vitamin combination hard investigate . In current study , propose investigate effect Retaron® , combination carotoinoids , omega-3-fatty acid , herbal extract Aronia , vitamins trace element , systemic in-vivo inflammation model . In present study , infusion LPS , cell wall component gram-negative bacteria major mediator pathogenesis septic shock , use standardized experimental model systemic inflammation human . Given inflammation associate enhance oxidative stress widespread endothelial dysfunction , LPS model well suitable determination antioxidative effect Retaron® . As main outcome parameter vascular reactivity retinal vessel systemic hyperoxia ( induced breathe 100 % oxygen ) test presence absence antioxidant combination .</brief_summary>
