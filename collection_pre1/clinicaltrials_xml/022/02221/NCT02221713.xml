	<brief_summary>Colonic diverticulum outpouchings large bowel , occur 60 % people 60 year age . About 10-25 % patient diverticulum symptom . These range acute diverticulitis , lethal infection symptomatic diverticular disease , involve inflammation bowel alter bowel habit , decrease patient ' quality life . We know patient develop acute diverticulitis patient develop diverticula colon . We believe diverticulitis may associate , even cause , alteration bacteria live colon , know gut microbiome . Until recently expensive complex examine microbiome detail . We propose examine first time detail microbiome patient acute diverticulitis asymptomatic diverticulosis . Stool sample analyse gut microbiome composition 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing . There part bacterial cell , ribosome , bacteria ( 16S ) . Through PCR , polymerase chain reaction , sequence , separate different type bacteria sample . We look different kind bacteria patient population , well diverse population within group , compare group . We hope able discriminate microbiome patient acute diverticulitis asymptomatic diverticulosis . This study many change diverticulitis diverticulosis conceptualize treat . Alterations microbiome disease state may able treat , prevent disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Gut Microbiome Diverticulitis Diverticulosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diverticulosis affect 60 % people 60 roughly 10-25 % individual symptom , range acute diverticulitis require emergent intervention symptomatic diverticular disease persistent lower abdominal pain alter bowel habit . Up 5 % patient acute diverticulitis die hospitalize . In spite prevalence severity manifestation , fundamental question remain nature diverticulitis diverticulosis . The human colon contain 100 trillion bacteria , include hundred species 10 time many gene human genome . While alteration microbiome implicated disease state Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) , microbiome adequately describe relation colonic diverticulum . As King 's College Hospital know dedicate Diverticular Disease clinic , uniquely large patient population learn condition . When colonic diverticulum become inflamed perforate , patient diverticulitis . Inciting factor episode acute diverticulitis well characterize , include age , lifestyle factor certain medication . Clinicians way predict patient get diverticulitis , severe presentation . In case pericolonic diverticulitis ( know Hinchey I ) , inflammation may resolve even without antibiotic , case , perforate diverticulitis include feculent peritonitis ( Hinchey IV ) require emergent colon resection . Diverticulitis may cause alteration microbiome , sufficiently address . The majority patient asymptomatic diverticulosis , , presence colonic diverticulum absence symptom , never experience episode diverticulitis . There , however , limited evidence microbiome diverticulosis alter , similar acute diverticulitis . If , predict patient develop acute diverticulitis remain impossible . It also mean research ass control presence diverticulum patient population need revisit . Currently , clinician basis predict ( 1 ) patient develop severe acute diverticulitis require surgery ( 2 ) patient develop acute diverticulitis resolve antibiotic . We believe insight gut microbiome allow good diagnostics treatment future . There , limited study microbiome diverticulitis , full pyrosequencing . This research cost fall 5 order magnitude past decade computational capacity increase . Studies look individual strain bacteria within stool mucosal sample , suffice understand complex microbiome . As gut microbiome thoroughly investigate diverticular disease , exploratory study . However , wish test hypotheses patient asymptomatic diverticulosis microbiome similar patient acute diverticulitis , normal control . 14 . Methodology Setting : King 's College Hospital , tertiary referral hospital south London . King 's referral centre work two-week wait colorectal cancer ( 2ww ) assessment , 900 new patient referral assess per year . Also , Accident &amp; Emergency Department King 's admits 250 patient per year acute diverticulitis . Patients : 4 set patient recruit . 25 patient per group recruit : Groups A B . Patients acute diverticulitis recruit A &amp; E department King 's , prior commencement antibiotic . Rectal swab obtain patient chief complaint acute abdominal pain upon initial assessment , prior initial antibiotic . All specimen initially frozen , patient specimens admit diagnosis acute diverticulitis colonic imaging ( CT image visualization surgery ) analyse . Patients acute diverticulitis assess 2 group , patient perforate diverticulitis ( i.e. , Hinchey III IV ) patient unperforated diverticulitis ( Hinchey I II ) . Group C. Patients asymptomatic diverticulosis recruit 2-week wait ( 2ww ) colorectal cancer pathway . Patients present chief complaint fresh rectal bleeding , complaint , recruit prior diagnostic imaging , either CT , CT colonography , endoscopy . They provide stool sample rectal swab prior bowel cleansing , require evaluation , may alter microbiome . Those patient sample diverticulosis ( haemorrhoid , common cause fresh PR bleeding ) analyse . Group D. Patients without haemorrhoid , colonic pathology recruit 2ww colorectal cancer pathway . These normal control . Patients present chief complaint fresh PR bleeding , complaint , recruit prior diagnostic imaging , either CT , CT colonography , endoscopy . They provide stool sample rectal swab prior bowel cleansing , require evaluation , may alter microbiome . Those patient sample diverticulosis ( haemorrhoid , common cause fresh PR bleeding ) analyse . Stool analysis : Stool sample analyse faecal microbiome composition 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing , cooperative agreement Bruce lab King 's College London . In brief , gene target 16S rRNA sequence examines structural component bacterial ribosome target primer . Constant portion ribosomal RNA amplify , allow identification variable portion . Sequences cluster OTUs , operational taxonomic unit may assign lineage genus way phylum . Planned statistical analysis : Microbiome composition assess several different way . Alpha diversity measure , measure average diversity within sample . Multiple assessment alpha diversity make , include Chaol richness estimate , OTU richness , Shannon index . Alpha diversity show reduced patient active IBD compare patient quiescent disease , describe diverticular disease . Beta diversity comparison diversity sample ( , separation phylogenetic structure OTUs one sample compare sample ) calculate Unifrac distance . Power calculation : Metabonomic study gut microbiome time necessarily exploratory . As power calculation perform field . However , instance analyse 25 sample per group sufficient discriminate group assess diversity . Existing infrastructure : All infrastructure need currently place . The study team ( Professor Bjarnason Mr Papagrigoriadis ) currently manage 2ww clinic , well attend acute admission A &amp; E King 's College Hospital . A material transfer agreement place Bruce lab King 's College London transfer faecal sample , would need amend .</detailed_description>
