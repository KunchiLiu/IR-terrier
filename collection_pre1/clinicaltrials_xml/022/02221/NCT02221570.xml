	<brief_title>Baclofen Treatment Muscle Cramps Patients With Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle cramp common patient liver disease associate significantly diminish quality life . Patients cirrhosis often experience muscle cramp vary frequency severity . The exact mechanism occur remain unclear , although number pathophysiological event unique liver disease may contribute . Clinical study identify alteration 3 area : nerve function , energy metabolism , plasma volume/electrolytes . Although number mechanism cramp liver disease postulate targeted medical therapy , clear picture causal event emerge . Several agent vitamin E , human albumin , zinc , taurine , eperisone hydrochloride branched-chain amino acid show benefit small uncontrolled study , although large randomize controlled trial lack . Baclofen , derivative gamma-aminobutyric acid , muscle relaxant antispastic agent . It introduce 1966 possible treatment spasticity due corticospinal tract lesion . Baclofen also test promising result treatment medical disorder cluster headache , gastroesophageal reflux disease , chronic hiccup cough . The aim study assess efficacy baclofen treatment muscle cramp patient liver cirrhosis .</detailed_description>
