	<brief_title>A Survey Google Glass Orthopaedic Trauma Patients Surgeons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Google Glass new low-profile wearable technology allow physician record hands-free video picture directly video link communicate wearer device . In addition , device head display capable search internet voice command . The device functionality smart phone benefit hands-free wearable . The device currently beta test period `` Explorers '' accept application program use assess device . The investigator able obtain three device . The Google Glass device ability help improve connectivity physician locale , increase efficiency provide good access vital information use medical surgical setting . The device clear teaching implication enable academic physician disseminate information student situations previously possible . As device evolve potential likely develop . It important assess impact rapidly grow field patient sentiment wellbeing . As new device , study do assess application Medicine specifically orthopaedic surgery . So far specific small study do regard immunochromatographic analysis , pharmacology , forensic medicine Parkinson 's disease . The investigator aim ass application patient perspective device much large scale . The investigator feel technology future offspring could polarize regard patient response . This could important element consider future development clinical application . There direct medical risk patient . No decision regard patient care dependent device . Study Objective Primary question : What patient 's level acceptance response new technology ? Secondary question : From doctor 's perspective , effective new tool Orthopaedic clinical setting ? Design Patients see Orthopaedic Trauma clinic ask consent potential video/picture record use Google Glass device visit orthopaedic surgeon resident . Eligible patient assign one two consulting room : one Google Glass device , one without . Patients therefore 50.50 chance encounter Google Glass . Any image video take show patient face , measure take ensure confidentiality . Both group ask complete small survey lock password protect iPad visit record acceptability new technology clinical setting . Participants experience device also required comment experience . The device user ( surgeon/resident ) also complete survey record experience use hand free camera record device . The information gather save password protect drive use discussion analysis investigator help develop potential future teach clinical application device .</detailed_description>
