	<detailed_description>This study assess 3 different score system evaluate adhesive quality `` placebo '' patch ( inactive patch contains active drug ) , JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G transdermal ( skin ) system . In study , patch NOT compare patch drug , NOT use test patch drug real effect clinical trial . The study consist 3 part : Screening ( 21 day study commences Day 1 ) , adhesion assessment period ( 4 day ) , end Study ( EOS ) assessment ( record 24 hour +/- 4 hour follow patch removal ) . Total study duration per participant 26 day ( include Screening ) . JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023 small ( 5.5 cm^2 ) large ( 44 cm^2 ) patch apply leave right side paraspinal region base randomization schedule . Adhesion assessment perform patch application ( hour 0 , Baseline ) , time interval 8 10 hour , 24 , 48 , 72 hour follow patch application . Adhesion quality assess visual grading , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) scale , digital image analysis visual grading grid system . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
