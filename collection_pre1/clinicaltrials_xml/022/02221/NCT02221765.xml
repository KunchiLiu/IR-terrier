	<brief_summary>Obesity grow pandemic affect 1 4 adult UK , shorten life increase cardiovascular disease , diabetes cancer . Current treatment obesity either poor efficacy significant side effect . Pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) promise new drug target produce powerful appetite suppression , follow 90-minute infusion continue act 24 h man . We develop new long lasting high potency analogue PP , PP1420 . This delivered once-a-day subcutaneous injection via painless fine-gauge needle . In first-time-in-man Phase 1a trial , PP 1420 prove safe , well tolerate , extend pharmacokinetics compare PP . We plan study safety PK PP1420 64mg . We also assess : 1 . Its efficacy reduce food intake single dose Phase 1B study healthy volunteer . 2 . Its efficacy reduce food intake weight multiple dose Phase 1C study healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Study PP1420 HV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 25 % people UK obese . People obesity short life expectancy , high risk heart attack , stroke , high blood pressure , diabetes , certain cancer . At moment , treatment obesity effective safe . Advising people change diet exercise frequently ineffective , loss weight see usually temporary . There one medication license purpose lose weight , limited side-effects . Finally , gastric bypass similar surgery effective reduce weight permanently , risky restrict motivated people . `` Gut hormone '' natural chemical make bowel eat . They work reduce appetite hunger eat , eat enough need . We think one reason gastric bypass surgery effective surgery cause increase gut hormone secretion bloodstream , suppress appetite . One hormones pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) , release bloodstream cell pancreas eating . When human PP give healthy volunteer injection , see reduce appetite food intake side-effects feel sick vomiting . Human PP last long blood stream . In order make new , safe effective drug obesity , develop new form PP , similar identical human PP , expect last long blood . We call PP 1420 . In test , PP 1420 reduce food intake animal , safe much high dos plan give current study . PP1420 previously give healthy volunteer single dos 8mg without serious problem . All dos well tolerate . This study examine safety tolerability PP 1420 give single dos higher dos , 64 mg , safety , tolerability efficacy PP 1420 give multiple dos 28 day .</detailed_description>
