	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , single dose trial evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile ( drug absorb body , distribute within body remove body time ) child age birth le 2 year schedule surgical procedure routinely produce moderate severe acute post-surgical pain . The trial also evaluate safety tolerability tapentadol oral solution population study effect tapentadol oral solution pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Tapentadol Oral Solution Pain After Surgery Children From Newborn Less Than 2 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial 3 phase : enrollment , treatment ( 15 hour ) follow . During enrolment phase consent eligibility determine . After surgery , participant give routine pain medication per standard care hospital . Treatment phase : When participant function gastrointestinal tract surgery , tolerate medication administer orally via feed tube , meet inclusion criterion , meet exclusion criterion , participant allocate IMP . Evaluations perform next 15 hour , include assessment amount pain . During time , 2 blood sample take test amount tapentadol main metabolite participant 's blood . A final follow-up visit plan take place 2 week take trial medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) give write informed consent participate . Participant obese ( e.g. , body weight 97th percentile child base World Health Organization weight chart ) minimum body weight 2.5 kg . Physical status rat high P3 American Society Anesthesiologists physical status classification participant age 1 month less 2 year . Participant undergone surgery , investigator 's opinion , would reliably produce moderate severe pain require opioid treatment . At time allocation IMP , participant sedation score high 2 ( moderately sedate ) University Michigan Sedation Scale exception participant mechanically ventilated age subgroup 3 , function gastrointestinal tract surgery , tolerate medication administer orally via feed tube time allocation IMP . Participant reliable venous vascular access pharmacokinetic blood sampling . The participant 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) employee investigator trial site , direct involvement trial trial direction investigator trial site , participant , participant 's parent ( ) , legal guardian ( ) family member employee investigator . Participant previously expose tapentadol . Participant receive experimental drug use experimental medical device within 28 day allocation study medication , within period le 10 time drug 's halflife , whichever longer . Concomitant participation another interventional clinical trial duration trial . Participant undergone brain surgery . Participant undergone surgery expect affect absorption tapentadol ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract ) . Participant history current condition one following : Seizure disorder . Traumatic hypoxic brain injury , i.e . brain contusion , stroke , transient ischemic attack , intracranial bleeding hematoma , brain neoplasm . Participant history current condition one following : Moderate severe renal impairment . Moderate severe hepatic impairment , congestive hepatopathy , hepatic portosystemic shunting . Clinically relevant abnormal pulmonary function clinically relevant respiratory disease opinion investigator would put participant risk develop respiratory depression , unless participant mechanically ventilated age subgroup 3 . Participant sign symptom congestive heart failure ( e.g. , require minimal inotropic support , abnormal lactic acid value great 2times upper limit normal ) , hemorrhagic disorder follow surgery . Minimal inotropic medication define : Dopamine le equal 5 microgram/kg per minute . Epinephrine le equal 0.03 microgram/kg per minute ( dopamine epinephrine ) . Milrinone less equal 0.5 microgram/kg per minute le . Participant concomitant disease disorder ( e.g. , endocrine , metabolic , neurological , psychiatric disorder , febrile seizure paralytic ileus ) opinion investigator may affect compromise participant 's safety trial participation . Participant cognitive developmental impairment trial participation may affect compromise participant 's safety , participant 's ability comply protocol requirement ( appropriate participant 's age ) , investigator 's judgment . Otherwise , participant 's cognitive developmental impairment may enrol trial . Participant clinically relevant history hypersensitivity , allergy , contraindication tapentadol ( ingredient ) . Participant : Clinically relevant abnormal 12lead ECG investigator 's judgment . Signs preexcitation syndrome . Corrected QT ( QTcF ) interval great 460 m . Participant may allocate Investigational Medicinal Product value great 460 m , investigator 's opinion , value consequence cardiac surgery consider clinically significant . Participant clinically relevant abnormal lab value sample obtain postoperatively prior allocation study medication . The following specification apply : Aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase great 2.5times upper limit normal . Total bilirubin great 2times upper limit normal direct bilirubin great 20 % total bilirubin , participant age subgroup 3 , presence pathological jaundice opinion investigator . Glomerular filtration rate ( calculate accord Schwartz et al . 1984 ) : le 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant less 1 week old . le 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant 1 week 8 week old . le 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant 8 week old . Other parameter ( investigator 's judgment ) . Signs symptom indicative systemic infection within 24 hour prior allocation study medication . Participant administer prohibited medication . The mother newborn breastfeed mother participant administer prohibited medication . At time dosing , investigator 's judgment , participant either following : Clinically unstable upper low airway condition respiratory depression ( unless participant mechanically ventilated age subgroup 3 ) . Clinically unstable systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate . Participant peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) &lt; 92 % acyanotic participant , &lt; 75 % cyanotic participant , without supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula high flow nasal cannula , time allocation Investigational Medicinal Product . For age subgroup 1 age subgroup 2 , participant require continuous positive airway pressure mechanical ventilation , time allocation Investigational Medicinal Product .</criteria>
