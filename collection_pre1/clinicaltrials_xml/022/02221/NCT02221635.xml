	<detailed_description>Schizoaffective disorder chronic illness generally require life-long treatment . To date however , physical therapy evaluate maintenance treatment schizoaffective disorder . This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign drug ) , medication-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , monotherapy adjunct antipsychotic , relative antipsychotic drug delay time relapse patient schizoaffective disorder . Patients acute symptom schizoaffective disorder enrol . The study consist 4 period : 7 day screening/tolerability period , 6-week open-label flexible dose lead-in period , 6-week open-label fix dose stabilization period , 12 month double-blind relapse prevention period . Patients without previous exposure rTMS give 4 6 day rTMS tolerability testing . Patients continue current antipsychotic drug Day-1 ( day start study period ) . During open-label period , patient treat Risperidone . Patients meet pre-determined stabilization criterion eligible enter double-blind relapse prevention period randomly assign either receive rTMS rTMS+Risperidone treatment . Efficacy evaluate study use relapse assessment ( time subject randomization treatment first occurrence relapse Relapse Prevention Period ) . Secondary Outcome Measures : Secondary Outcome Measures : Symptom change measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total PANSS factor score ; Illness severity change measure Clinical Global Impression Severity depression ( CGI-S-DEP ) ; Change subject function use Personal Social Performance Scale ; Change subject medication satisfaction use Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire ( MSQ ) . Safety assess throughout study monitor adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement ( temperature , pulse , blood pressure ) , weight . A 10 milliliter pharmacogenomic blood sample ( sample DNA research ) collect patient give separate write informed consent part study .</detailed_description>
