	<brief_summary>AML 18 replacement trial AML16 intensive . This 1600 patient trial primarily design patient age 60 consider fit enough intensive chemotherapy approach aim test effect add 1 2 new treatment agent commonly use chemotherapy combination order improve patient survival treatment regime . The AML18 Trial available patient primary secondary AML define WHO Classification ( exclude Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia ) , high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( i.e . &gt; 10 % marrow blast ) age 60 . AML18 randomise controlled Phase III trial use factorial design maximum efficiency evaluate two induction option follow treatment small molecule post course 1 dose intensification suitable patient . There four randomisation comparison within trial : The first randomisation compare standard chemotherapy schedule Daunorubicin/AraC ( DA ) combine 1 2 dos Mylotarg course 1 . Patients suitable receive Mylotarg may DA alone . Following recovery course 1 patient fail achieve CR MRD positive centralise flow cytometry randomise one three option , either DA chemotherapy , DA chemotherapy plus Cladribine Flag Ida 2 course therapy . Patients achieve CR course 1 randomise 1 2 course DA chemotherapy . At course 2 patient also enter randomisation receive AC220 versus AC220 without maintenance , Ganetespib verse Ganetespib maximum 3 cycle . Patients eligible non-intensive allogeneic stem cell transplant suitable HLA match donor available .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>They one form acute myeloid leukaemia , except Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia define WHO Classification ( Appendix A ) type de novo secondary AML high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome , define great 10 % marrow blast ( RAEB2 ) . They normally age 60 , patient age eligible consider eligible MRC AML17 trial . They give write informed consent . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN ( upper limit normal ) Patients eligible Mylotarg randomisation must Serum Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 × ULN bilirubin ≤2.× ULN In order eligible receive cladribine , serum creatinine must within local ULN enter randomisation . Patients case randomise remain option . Sexually mature male must agree use adequate medically accept method contraception throughout study sexual partner woman child bear potential ( WOCBP ) . Similarly woman must agree adequate contraceptive measure . In male female measure must place least 30 day last administration ganetespib 6 month last administration Cladribine . ECOG Performance Status 02 Patients eligible AML18 trial : They previously receive cytotoxic chemotherapy AML [ Hydroxycarbamide , similar lowdose therapy , control white count prior initiation intensive therapy , exclusion ] They blast transformation chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) They concurrent active malignancy exclude basal cell carcinoma They pregnant lactate They Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Patients AST ALT 2.5 time local upper limit normal , bilirubin twice upper limit normal , eligible Mylotarg randomisation . In addition patient eligible AC220 Ganetespib randomisation : Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include : A myocardial infarction within 12 month Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Current history congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , unless echocardiogram ( ECHO ) Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) perform either within 1 month prior study screen screen result leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 45 % ( institutional low limit normal value ) Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome . Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes [ TdP ] ) ; history arrhythmia discuss Sponsor 's Medical Monitor prior patient 's entry study Prolonged QTcF interval preentry ECG ( ≥450 m ) average 3 reading within 2 hour period Any history second third degree heart block ( may eligible patient currently pacemaker ) Heart rate &lt; 50/minute preentry ECG Uncontrolled hypertension Obligate need cardiac pacemaker Complete leave bundle branch block Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation Serum potassium , magnesium , calcium level least within institutional normal limit , every effort make keep potassium institutional normal limit , every effort make keep magnesium concentration 4.0 mEq/dL , serum calcium normal concentration .</criteria>
