	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ponatinib hydrochloride work treat patient cancer spread part body ( metastatic ) , fail previous treatment ( refractory ) , one several alteration , mutation , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence . Ponatinib hydrochloride may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether patient 's genetic alteration may affect well ponatinib hydrochloride work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ponatinib Patients Whose Advanced Solid Tumor Cancer Has Activating Mutations Involving Following Genes : FGFR1 , FGFR2 , FGFR3 , FGFR4 , RET , KIT .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response ponatinib ( ponatinib hydrochloride ) patient fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) alter cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability ponatinib advance solid tumor genomic FGFR alteration . II . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ponatinib . III . To determine candidate genomic proteomic biomarkers sensitivity resistance ponatinib use unbiased high throughput approach ( exome , transcriptome , reverse phase protein array [ RPPA ] ) . IV . To assess response ponatinib advance cancer subset genomic FGFR alteration ( fusion vs. amplification vs. mutation ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 52 week .</detailed_description>
