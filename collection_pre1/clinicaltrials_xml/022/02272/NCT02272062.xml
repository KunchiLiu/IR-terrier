	<brief_title>Patient-Reported Preferences Affecting Revascularization Decisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selecting treatment strategy patient symptomatic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) require integrated consideration symptom burden , patient preference , practice guideline . In many clinical scenario , equipoise regard need revascularize ( percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) vs. medical management ) and/or type revascularization ( PCI vs. bypass surgery ) . Patients may minimal direct input decision proceed revascularization procedure , especially case ad hoc PCI . There little guidance literature regard strategy improve patient participation revascularization decision . There share decision-making tool provide accessible information interventional cardiologist prior PCI . An educational program provide basic information regard CAD revascularization procedure could lead improved patient knowledge inform participation critical decision . A clinical survey assess patient symptom burden preference could provide valuable information physician time angiography . The investigator aim test clinical tool address need administered pre-procedure area immediately prior angiography . If successful , tool could lead great informed patient participation revascularization procedure improve patient satisfaction . First , investigator conduct pre-post analysis . The first 100 enrolled patient undergo usual care without use decision-making tool . Surveys prior angiography 3 month test knowledge decisional self-efficacy . Subsequently , 200 patient utilize decision-making tool complete survey . Comparison group test ability decision-making tool improve knowledge CAD accurately assess preference . Among 200 patient utilizing decision-making tool , patient randomly assign , , preference share interventional cardiologist time catheterization . This randomized portion study test impact patient preference treatment decision .</detailed_description>
