	<brief_summary>The specific aim study evaluate safety non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) impact renal function and/or contribution exercise-associated hyponatremia ( EAH ) ultramarathon foot race . There currently much debate whether NSAID ingestion endurance event contribute acute kidney injury . Endurance event often ignite `` perfect storm '' physiologic insults- heat stress , dehydration , myopathy- negatively impact kidney function . There concern NSAIDs may potentiate negative effect well contribute EAH anti-diuretic affect . To date , power , prospective study ever examine effect NSAIDs either two biochemical outcome Ultramarathon endurance event , define race longer marathon ( 26.2 mile ) , increase popularity , 10 % increase annual participant , 69,000 finisher worldwide 2013 . Considerable literature document alteration serum biochemical profile endurance athlete , consistent evidence elevate serum creatinine ( Cr ) level healthy race finisher well seek medical care . While acute renal failure ultramarathon runner rare occurrence , acute kidney injury common , range 34 % single-stage ultramarathon 55-80 % multi-stage ultramarathons . The evidence equivocal regard NSAID ingestion AKI . One study show runner ingested NSAIDs prior marathon great post-race creatinine level match controls well high rate hospitalization acute renal failure . However , contrast several study show marked lack difference creatinine level development acute kidney injury NSAID user non-users ultramarathons . The randomized trial date subject find difference serum creatinine level NSAID placebo group ultramarathon race end , however conclusion limit small unpowered sample size . Exercise associate hyponatremia ( EAH ) , define serum sodium concentration 135mEq/L , recognize relatively common issue endurance run event . The incidence EAH vary depend upon distance race , report value 3-28 % marathon , 23 - 38 % triathlons 4-51 % single-stage ultramarathons . EAH likely under-diagnosed athlete often asymptomatic . While EAH often manifest non-specific symptom nausea , vomit , dizziness , fatigue , potentially fatal disease progress encephalopathy , seizure , pulmonary edema , death . There large prospective study examine relationship EAH NSAID ingestion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct fifth stage 6-stage ultramarathon foot race cover total 250 kilometer . Data collect four separate event course come year . All race run RacingThePlanet™ 4-desert race series location include : Jordan , Ecuador , China , Chile . The evening stage 4 , participant remind check medical tent prior stage 5 start , time participant weigh give study drug packet ( ibuprofen visually identical placebo ) . Approximately 80 % finisher complete 80-kilometer Stage 5 less 19 hour , majority participant ingest 1600mg ibuprofen ( 400mg q 4 hour x 4 dos ) . The optimal adult dose analgesia 400mg every 4 hour , maximum daily dose 3200mg ( ( 1999 ) . Product information : Motrin™ , ibuprofen . Kalamazoo , MI , Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company . ) Immediately cross finish line Stage 5 , participant reweighed , seat study tent fingertip blood sample obtain via lancet capillary collection tube ( Mock , Morrison , &amp; Yatscoff , 1995 ) analyze Na , Cr BUN ( utilize Chem-8 cartridge ) onsite immediately collection use iSTAT® point-of- care analyzer ( Abbott ; East Windsor , NJ ) . Any participant complete stage prior stage 5 remove competition study . Both point-of-care device digital scale calibrate prior take measurement . At point , study participant responsibility .</detailed_description>
