	<brief_summary>Research hypothesis : Is treatment renal denervation ( RDN ) early post ACS safe effective lead improve cardiac function attenuation pathologic leave ventricular remodelling ? In follow study , hypothesis test large ACS population major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) ACS endpoint . Rationale conduct study : ACS i.e . ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) non- ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( non-STEMI ) important cause morbidity mortality western society . Hypertension major risk factor development ACS heart failure also worsen prognosis patient ACS . Our research highlight combination therapy PCI RDN ACS patient population simultaneous hypertension . Primary objective : The primary objective study establish safety efficacy combine treatment PCI renal denervation ( RDN ) hypertensive patient acute coronary syndrome ( STEMI non-STEMI ) ventricular mass 4 month primary variable . Endpoints : The primary end point change leave ventricular mass ( LVM ) 4 month evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Secondary endpoint : , blood pressure ( office 24-h ABPM ) , leave ventricular volume ejection fraction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sympathetic nervous system play crucial role development progression hypertension adverse consequence . Despite availability numerous effective pharmacologic treatment , adequate blood pressure control achieve large number subject . Patients essential hypertension generally increase efferent sympathetic drive kidney increase rate sympathetic-nerve firing , possibly modulate afferent signal renal sensory nerve . Recently develop endovascular catheter technology enable selective denervation human kidney . A safety feasibility trial procedure identify substantial reduction blood pressure without substantial procedure-related complication . The therapeutic value seem present hypertension may also interest many clinical condition e.g . heart failure , chronic end-stage renal disease insulin resistance diabetes . The present study ( COMBI-RDN ) randomise clinical trial 40 patient investigate safety efficacy combination Percutan Coronar Interventiom ( PCI ) renal denervation ( RDN ) RDN perform early acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . This study consider pilot study evaluate efficacy safety patient ACS . In second phase randomise , multicenter study approximately 2500 patient demonstrate whether RDN early post ACS could decrease major adverse cardiovascular event hypertensive patient ACS . Research hypothesis Is treatment renal denervation ( RDN ) early post ACS safe effective lead improve cardiac function attenuation pathologic leave ventricular remodelling ?</detailed_description>
