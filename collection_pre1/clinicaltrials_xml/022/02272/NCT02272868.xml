	<brief_title>Fecal Microbial Transplant Pediatric Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-two patient mild moderate active Crohn 's Disease ( PCDAI 15-45 ) age 12-21 enrolled study . Patients randomize pre-treatment conditioning + FMT versus pre-treatment conditioning + placebo . Pre transplant conditioning include rifaximin ( 400mg PO three time day x 10 day prior transplant ) , MiraLAX cleanout ( 2 day prior cleanout ) , omeprazole ( day prior day transplant ) . Study subject nasogastric ( NG ) tube place day transplant either donor stool normal saline ( placebo ) infuse via tube . A designated clinician transplant keep subject blinded treatment group . A different designated clinician , blind treatment group subject , follow-up telephone call visit . Study subject telephone follow 2 day 2 , 6 12 week post transplant see clinic . The PCDAI complete study visit ( exclude phone call ) . Additionally , physcian 's global assessment document study visit ( exclude phone call ) . The global assessment report quiescent , mild , moderate severe . Study subject recipients/guardian provide diary card initiation rifaximin 12 week post transplant record AEs , review every follow-up encounter . The diary card include duration event , intensity event , medication action take event . Individuals receive placebo treatment offer FMT termination study . These patient follow week 2 , 6 12 post transplant CRC . Donor stool save Clinical Research Lab initial baseline visit . This stool use FMT individual . Randomization The study participant randomize use RedCap database . All study relate information store RedCap study . Participant data study store electronically REDCap platform . The REDCap platform manage Institute Clinical Translational Science University Washington . Only IRB approve research team member access REDCap data platform . Each team member grant access REDCap data system secure login.The information participant de-identified use unique study code . The randomization set 16 participant receive FMT 16 participant receive placebo . For individual receive placebo , option receive FMT upon completion study . The physician completes FMT individual study team unblinded randomization . Study Procedures : Screening The screening visit take place Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic Seattle Children 's Hospital . At visit , subject recipient donor review study detail PI/Research Coordinator . Consent/Assent obtain prior study activity perform . The research subject receive copy Signed Consent/Assent form record . Once Consent/Assent obtain vital sign include height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate body temperature obtain FMT recipient . Additionally , physical exam patient history include PCDAI , Paris classification PGA complete recipient . The FMT donor complete lifestyle questionnaire physician review medical history . Finally , lab complete recipient donor determine eligibility . The screen labs include blood stool test recipient donor . Additionally , FMT recipient , urine collect female child bear age urine pregnancy test . Some stool stool recipient send University Washington microbiome analysis storage . These sample de-identified labeled unique study code visit number . Consent storage part Informed Consent process . Baseline Once screen activity complete determine subject meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion subject return Pediatric Clinical Research Center Seattle Children 's Hospital receive provide stool/saline transplant . The maximum amount time elapse donor screen procurement stool transplant ( screen baseline ) less 4 week . All FMT/placebo donor provide stool sample visit regardless group recipient randomize ( informed information ) .This baseline visit . Prior visit , FMT/placebo recipient randomize group RedCap database . Only transplant physician know group participant randomize . Prior visit ALL recipient take Rifaximin 10 day ( 400 mg 3 times/day ) prior baseline visit . All study recipient also receive 20 mg Omeprazole day prior morning procedure . The study recipient also MiraLAX , 3 time day 2 day last dose 5 pm even prior PCRC visit . Stool transplant recipient stool collect microbiome analysis visit . At visit , fresh stool FMT donor obtain . A fresh sample define less 6 hour old . The stool weight need approximately 30 gram . If child randomize placebo group , fresh stool sample store freezer -80 °C . At end 12 week period , child receive placebo eligible receive FMT . At time , donor stool thaw process accord guideline FMT . The FMT/placebo recipient arrive fasting visit ( mean nothing eat drink midnight prior FMT ) . Vital sign physical exam complete baseline visit study recipient . Additionally , urine pregnancy test complete female study child bear potential ( FMT/placebo recipient ) . If test positive , terminate study . After vital sign collect urine pregnancy test complete , nasogastric tube place FMT/placebo recipient . Placement tube confirm abdominal x-ray . The stool donor place blender 90 ml final suspension infuse 3 minute period nasogastric tube . The nasogastric tube flush 15 ml normal saline 1 minute . After 15 minute , nasogastric tube remove . The FMT/placebo recipient able discharge CRC 30 minute stool transplant assume vital sign stable . The FMT/placebo recipient resume normal activity procedure . The AE diary thermometer measure temperature give subject coordinator prior discharge . Some stool FMT donor send University Washington microbiome analysis storage . Each sample de-identified label unique study code consent storage part IC process . If subject randomize placebo arm , study procedure still take place , however , receive 90 ml normal saline instead donor feces , follow 15 ml normal saline flush . The fresh stool stool donor store frozen Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) Lab . The stool donor store CRC lab use individual initially receive placebo . For group , syringe cover one identify receiving . One clinician designate complete Fecal transplant . This clinician complete follow visit . After baseline visit , stool donor participation complete . Donor stool preparation FMT 1 . Perform hand hygiene glove , gown , mask , eye shield stool preparation . 2 . Stool prepare dedicated room outpatient procedure area dedicate blender , 0.9 % saline , large syrinx . 3 . Timing stool collection close fecal transplant time possible , 6 hour procedure time . If frozen beforehand , please thaw 1 hour prior processing . 4 . Select stool specimen , preferably soft one . Add 100-200 mL preservative-free 0.9 % saline 30-70 gram stool process conventional , household blender create homogenize , liquid slurry . 5 . Use low set blender blend stool sample 2 4 minute sample smooth homogeneous . 6 . Strain slurry gauze mesh barrier remove large particulate matter remain slurry . Final prepare stool smooth consistency . For Universal Donor Stool Preparation follow preparation amend thereafter sterile pharmaceutical grade glycerol ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) final concentration 10 % , store frozen − 80 ° C . The stool suspension divide 90ml aliquot . Each 90 ml aliquot use separately . Thawing do 2 - 4 h ice bath FMT procedure . 9 For universal donor screen protocol non-universal donor screen follow , include aforementioned donor inclusion exclusion criterion screen lab . Day 2 Week 24 A telephone interview occur study physician assure study subject recipient clinically well . Any adverse event document time . The study physician completes call NOT physician complete transplant . Week 2 , week 6 week 12 Study subject return Pediatric Clinical Research Center clinical follow approximately 2 , 6 12 week day FMT/placebo . At visit vital sign include height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate body temperature obtain . Additionally , physical exam PCDAI PGA complete . A review subject AE diary also occur visit . We collect blood stool FMT/placebo recipient visit . Some stool FMT/placebo recipient send University Washington microbiome analysis storage visit . Each sample de-identified label unique study code consent storage part IC process .</detailed_description>
