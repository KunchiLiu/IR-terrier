	<brief_summary>The overall objective study determine whether serum BPA and/or phthalate concentration differ fertile versus infertile men woman Saskatchewan . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . Serum BPA and/or phthalate concentration great woman unexplained infertility PCOS compare control group 2 . Serum BPA and/or phthalate concentration great men male factor infertility compare control group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Sample : Couples undergo vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and/or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection ( ICSI ) assist reproduction ARTUS well healthy male female volunteer 18-43 year age ask participate . In order infertility patient eligible , male female partner must agree participate . Couples combination male female factor infertility eligible participate . Couples undergoing infertility treatment follow reason evaluate : - unexplained infertility ( n=15 men , n=15 woman ) - PCOS ( n=15 men , n=15 woman ) - Male factor infertility ( n=15 men , n=15 woman ) Couples male factor infertility serve control female comparison ( i.e. , follicular fluid analysis ) , couple PCOS serve control male comparison ( i.e. , seminal plasma analysis ) . Additional participant assign follow control group ( blood sample analysis ) : -Healthy volunteer history current diagnosis reproductive dysfunction ( n=15 men , n=15 woman ) Participant Recruitment : Infertile couple recruit clinical practice Drs . Allison Case Adrian Gamelin Assisted Reproductive Technologies Centre University Saskatchewan ( ARTUS ) . Posters recruit ARTUS patient also place wait room examine room Dept OB/GYN , Division REI . Healthy male female volunteer recruit advertisement PAWS website University Saskatchewan Health E-News newsletter Saskatoon Health Region . Pre-Study Visit : Eligible participant ask visit ARTUS Centre pre-study appointment . At appointment , study procedure discuss participant consent obtain . Study Visits : Blood follicular fluid sample obtain female partner infertile couple . Blood seminal plasma sample obtain male partner infertile couple . Only blood sample collect healthy men woman . All sample collect fertile infertile couple 2 week time interval . A. Infertile couple : Infertile couple participate study undergo fertility treatment per normal standard care . In word , fertility medication , ultrasound assessment , blood work treatment , oocyte retrieval , semen collection , laboratory procedure embryo transfer procedure affect participate study . Both male female partner ask provide 1 extra blood sample ( approximately 7 mL 1 teaspoon blood ) follow regularly-scheduled appointment : 1 . First ultrasound visit ( approximately day 1 FSH therapy ) 2 . Day egg retrieval 3 . Day embryo transfer Women normally undergo regular blood draw IVF treatment ; therefore , one additional tube draw research purpose regularly-scheduled blood draw appointment . Men normally provide blood sample IVF treatment , ask study . Blood draw perform phlebotomist ( staff specialize draw blood ) Royal University Hospital , physicians , nurse and/or researcher train phlebotomy . The blood sample process remove cell , serum frozen 12-24 month completion study . The follicle woman 's ovary drain egg retrieve follicular fluid , per standard care . After egg collect , follicular fluid normally throw away . In study , collect fluid follicle ovary egg retrieve . The follicular fluid frozen 12-24 month study completion . A semen sample provide man day oocyte retrieval procedure , per standard care . The semen sample process allow semen pass column separate motile sperm ( move quickly ) less motile non-motile sperm . The seminal plasma fluid portion semen remain motile sperm obtain . The seminal plasma normally throw away motile sperm obtain . In study , collect seminal plasma freeze 12-24 month study complete . B . Healthy Volunteers : Healthy volunteer ask provide 1 blood sample ( approximately 7 mL 1 teaspoon blood ) 3 separate day . Blood draw perform physician , nurse and/or researcher train phlebotomy ( i.e. , draw blood ) . Appointments blood draw make approximately 4-7 day apart . At completion study frozen blood , follicular fluid , seminal plasma sample transport Toxicology Center University Saskatchewan . The level exposure BPA phthalates evaluate . The sample destroy upon completion study . The expected duration study participation approximately 13-20 day ( accordance standard fertility therapy ) fertility patient 3 day healthy volunteer . All sample obtain 2 week time period . Statistical Analysis Include summary primary secondary end-points/outcomes , plan sample size ( justification ) plan statistical interim analysis . Study Endpoints : Exposure phthalates determine quantify concentration 5 different pthalates . Concentrations Bisphenol A ( BPA ) , di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , di-n-octyl phthalate ( DNOP ) , di-n-butyl phthalate ( DNBP ) , n-butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBP ) , diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , diisononyl phthalate ( DINP ) diisodecyl phthalate ( DIDP ) quantify blood cell , blood plasma , follicular fluid ( individual pool sample ) use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method already develop laboratory . Analyses conduct use Agilent 1200 series High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) system interfaced ABI SCIEX 3200 triple quadrapole mass spectrometer system QToF II quadrapole time flight mass spectrometer ( Micromass , Beverly MD ) . Toxicant concentration dependent variable . Reproductive status ( i.e , unexplained infertility , PCOS , male factor infertility , control ) independent variable . Concentrations BPA phthalates blood cell , blood plasma , seminal plasma pool follicular fluid compare study group use multivariate Analyses Variance ( ANOVA ) . n=15 per group appropriate conducting pilot study . Potential Significance/Justification : Greater knowledge possible effect BPA phthalates reproductive function may increase understanding cause infertility , assist prevent reproductive disease , optimize reproductive health , thereby improve patient care . We believe result study , whether positive negative , interest general public , health professional scientific community .</detailed_description>
