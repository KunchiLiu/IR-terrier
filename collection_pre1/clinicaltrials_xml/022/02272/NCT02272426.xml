	<brief_summary>It estimate 2 3 patient stroke problem memory , difficulty perform certain task , make decision learn new thing . In addition , many stroke patient get regular exercise often sedentary . Both physical cognitive exercise potential improve quality life , cognition , overall health , safety tolerability intervention clear stroke patient . The investigator examine outcomes allocate stroke survivor participant one three group : exercise program , combine exercise cognitive training program sham control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Tolerability Aerobic Resistance Exercise Program With Without Cognitive Training Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke well recognize lead cause disability United States . Cognitive deficit stroke common , even without dementia prior event , stroke patient bad cognition hospital admission bad outcome . Cognitive deficit contribute stroke-related disability mortality . Evidence suggest interaction cognitive deficit physical limitation , cognitive rehabilitation may improve functional outcome post stroke . Recent data also suggest cognitive training exercise intervention improve cognition stroke patient , randomize trial intervention , alone combination , conduct . We study effect Combined Aerobic Resistance Exercise Training ( CARET ) program , combination CARET CTI intervention primary outcome safety , feasibility , adherence among ischemic hemorrhagic stroke survivor mild moderate disability . We hypothesize intervention safe tolerable , lead improvement secondary outcome cognitive performance quality life . We also explore role Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor cognitive change relate physical exercise intervention .</detailed_description>
