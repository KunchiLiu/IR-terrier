	<detailed_description>Significant improvement make survival rate cancer patient . Due factor screen early detection cancer advance treatment , cancer today curable disease many . However , cancer survivor significantly increase risk morbidity adverse effect due treatment exposure . Commonly report consequence cancer treatment include fatigue , pain , depression , anxiety , reduce performance status decrease quality life Hence cancer today consider chronic illness , increase research carry cancer survivorship recommendation survivorship care pathway include intervention enhance physical psychosocial functioning cancer survivor . Previous study demonstrate exercise intervention relaxation positive effect physical psychosocial complaint cancer survivor . These intervention carry different way , different requirement perception two also different . No trial date carry comparing effect intervention quality life cancer survivor . Furthermore , majority research carry prevalent cancer include breast cancer , prostate cancer colorectal cancer , several author call future research focus understudy survivor group , include haematologic cancer site . This study aim compare effect exercise relaxation intervention quality life lymphoma survivor . The aim present study compare effect Exercise Intervention Program Relaxation Intervention sample lymphoma patient remission post-chemotherapy . Eligible subject randomise one two arm - either exercise relaxation arm . Both arm comprise home programme intervention ( either exercise relaxation ) half hour , carry three time week . Subjects assess use primary secondary outcome measure baseline , midway ( 6 week ) end intervention ( 12 week ) . It hypothesise 12 week training programme exercise relaxation would improve quality life lymphoma survivor , however exercise programme would result significantly great improvement relaxation . The null hypothesis would state would significant difference exercise relaxation group follow 12 week training programme lymphoma survivor . The aim study follow : Primary aim To compare effectiveness Exercise Relaxation improvement overall wellbeing quality life use European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire Core 30 ( EORTC-QLQ-C30 ) . Secondary aim To determine whether intervention result : - Improved cardio-respiratory fitness ( rest HR BP ) pulmonary function ( spirometry ) - Improved fitness exercise tolerance use 6 Minute Walk Test - Improved emotional functional confidence measure Health related quality life questionnaire Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Lymphoma version ( FACT-Lym ) - Decreased anxiety depression level use Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) - Changes haematology ( haemoglobin , immunoglobulin , white count ) biochemical ( serum albumin , correct calcium , creatinine ) parameters - Compare result outcome measure two intervention - Analyse subject perception intervention focus group</detailed_description>
