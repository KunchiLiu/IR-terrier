	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder ( BD ) chronic , often disable illness , many individual remain symptomatic despite pharmacotherapy . Significant mood variability often persist throughout lifespan predicts relapse , lead functional impairment . Metabolism dietary essential polyunsaturated fatty acid show upstream neuroinflammatory process may lead neurotoxicity chronicity illness BD . The investigator hypothesize intervention diet design alter intake polyunsaturated fatty acid augments mood stabilize medication reduce inflammation ; reduction inflammation reduce mood variability bipolar disorder . After two-the investigatorsek baseline-monitoring period , investigator randomize individual BD intervention control diet . Mood measure daily use smartphone . Phase 2 consist 12 investigatorseks less intense intervention . Follow-up complete 6 , 9 , 12 month post-baseline assess recurrence mood episode . By maintain certain diet addition take mood-stabilizing medication , researcher hope see whether specific dietary plan bear mood variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct 2-arm , parallel group , randomize , control 24-week dietary intervention evaluate therapeutic efficacy two dietary intervention patient BD . After two-week baseline-monitoring period , investigator randomize 84 patient chronic BD augment usual treatment either experimentally-altered omega-3 , omega-6 intervention control diet average US intakes n-3 n-6 fatty acid . Subjects group remain care physician full duration trial . During first phase trial ( 12 week ) , intervention intense , second phase ( 12 week ) , less intense intervention deliver , two phase intervention 24-week follow-up period . The study design achieve follow specific aim obtain support follow hypothesis : Specific Aim 1 ( primary mood outcome ) : To compare efficacy experimental dietary intervention control diet reduce variability mood symptom reduce general psychological distress . Hypothesis 1 : Compared control diet , experimental intervention produce significant improvement ( 1a ) variability daily mood symptom , energy , impulsivity use Visual Analogue Scale measure use ecological momentary analysis ( 1 ) ; ( 1b ) psychological distress general function use PROMIS-29 . Specific Aim 2 ( secondary mood outcome ) : To compare efficacy experimental dietary intervention control diet reduce recurrence . Hypothesis 2 : Compared control diet , experimental intervention produce significant reduction recurrence mood episodes 12-month period . To adequately power study measurement recurrence , investigator would need sample size 2-3 time investigator estimate study , therefore primary mood outcome recurrence episode , measurement mood variability , turn predicts recurrence . The investigator measure recurrence gather data future study . Specific Aim 3 ( primary biochemical outcome ) : To evaluate whether experimental dietary intervention alter n-6 AA bioactive metabolite , n-3 DHA bioactive metabolite patient BD . Hypothesis 3 : Compared control diet , experimental intervention significantly ( 1a ) alter n-6 AA n-3 DHA erythrocytes ; ( 1b ) alter 17-hydroxy DHA reduce PGE2 plasma . Exploratory Aims : In exploratory manner , investigator also ( 1 ) compare efficacy experimental dietary intervention control diet improve headache-related clinical endpoint subset BP patient comorbid migraine ; ( 2 ) test effect dietary intervention wide array bioactive derivative n-3 n-6 fatty acid inflammatory mediator ( e.g . cytokine , CRP ) ; ( 3 ) evaluate whether biochemical alteration n-3 DHA , n-6 AA bioactive metabolite related clinical improvement ( 4 ) compare efficacy experimental dietary intervention control diet prevent recurrence illness follow-up ; ( 5 ) store sample exploratory biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
