	<brief_summary>Rationale : Globally , vitamin B12 deficiency one common micronutrient deficiency . The relevant source Vitamin B12 animal-source food . Vitamin B12 crucial normal cell division necessary brain growth well maintenance normal function . Deficiency also associate impaired growth . In previous study , demonstrate vitamin B12 administration period six month enhance growth , score neuro-developmental test young Indian child . However , overall effect small , developmental score significant malnourish start study . Our finding need verify trial target young , malnourish child long supplementation time . Hypothesis : This propose study test three hypothesis ; measure extent 2 recommend daily allowance ( RDA ) vitamin B12 administration one year stunt child improve ; 1 ) growth , 2 ) neurodevelopment , 3 ) hemoglobin concentration . Study design : Randomized placebo-controlled trial . Half child receive paste contain vitamin B12 , half paste without vitamin B12 . Study participant site : 600 malnourish infant Bhaktapur municipality Nepal . In population demonstrate vitamin B12 deficiency poor growth common early childhood . Intervention : Daily administration paste contain vitamin B12 placebo 12 month Data : The main outcome study score developmental assessment tool growth measure every month 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific basis : Globally , vitamin B12 deficiency one common micronutrient deficiency . The relevant source vitamin B12 animal-source food . Vitamin B12 crucial normal cell division differentiation necessary development initial myelination central nervous system well maintenance normal function . Deficiency also associate impaired infant child growth . In previous clinical trial , demonstrate vitamin B12 administration period six month enhance growth neurodevelopment young Indian child . The overall effect growth significant small . We saw effect ponderal ( weight age z score ) linear ( height age z score ) growth . However , overall effect drive effect subgroups child waste , underweight stunt baseline , effect child malnourish baseline . This effect modification significant three ( stunt , waste , underweight ) baseline variable . Similarly , effect intervention neurodevelopmental score also strongest subgroup child stunt . We last 15 year undertaken study dietary intake status woman child Bhaktapur , Nepal . In site , vitamin B12 deficiency common . The objective propose study measure extent administration 2 RDA vitamin B12 stunt child last half infancy 12 month affect neurodevelopment , growth hemoglobin concentration . Hypothesis : Daily supplementation 2 RDA vitamin B12 young Nepali child 12 month improve neurodevelopment , growth hemoglobin concentration . Study design : Individually randomize placebo control , double blind trial . Children identify community stunt child randomize daily receive paste contain vitamin B12 placebo paste . The paste deliver trained field worker every day caregiver Saturdays public holiday . Study participant site : 600 stunt child age 6 11 month Bhaktapur municipality surround area . Intervention : Daily administration paste contain vitamin B12 placebo 12 month . Comparator : Placebo , identical vitamin B12 supplement . Data : Primary outcome : ( ) neurodevelopmental score measure Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development 3rd edition Ages Stages Questionnaire 3rd edition 6 12 month supplementation ( ii ) growth measure change height age , weight age weight height z-score study start end study growth velocity z score six first six last month supplementation ( iii ) hemoglobin concentration 12 month supplementation . Secondary : ( ) cognitive development child measure approximately 3 6 year enrollment , ( ii ) linear ponderal growth measure 2 3 year enrollment , ( iii ) hemoglobin concentration measure 2 3 year enrollment . All secondary outcome require additional funding . Relevance program public health : Improved learning ability growth young malnourish child . If supplementation effective consequence dietary recommendation malnourish child worldwide . In contrast relevant nutritional intervention , vitamin B12 inexpensive body ability store vitamin B12 , year . Thus , improve status nutrient limit time period may impact learn productivity beyond time administration help lift poor child vicious cycle poverty malnutrition .</detailed_description>
