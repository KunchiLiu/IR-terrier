	<brief_summary>Esophageal cancer one common malignant tumor China esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) dominant pathological type , account 95 % case . One phase Ⅱ study introduce combination treatment anti epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) agent , nimotuzumab , paclitaxel cisplatin first-line treatment unresectable metastatic ESCC . The result show overall response rate 51.8 % ( 29/56 ) disease control rate 92.9 % ( 52/56 ) . As median follow-up 24 month , median progression-free survival patient metastatic disease local advance disease 8.2 month 23 month respectively . The overall survival patient metastatic disease 13.9 month . It imply first-line chemotherapy , addition nimotuzumab chemotherapy active treatment option compare regimen publish previous study . Investigations Liang , J. Ling , Y. also suggest nimotuzumab combine radiotherapy chemotherapy also show anti-tumor activity limit toxicity . Therefore , initiated phase Ⅱ Ⅲ clinical trial combine neoadjuvant treatment nimotuzumab chemotherapy nimotuzumab radiotherapy compare surgery alone resectable stage Ⅱa Ⅲ middle lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patient . We hope explore neoadjuvant combination treatment could bring survival benefit ESCC patient .</brief_summary>
