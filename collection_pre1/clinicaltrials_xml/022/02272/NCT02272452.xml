	<brief_summary>The main ambition project develop , provide medical community , innovative method analyze extemporaneously , neurosurgery operation , excise tissue . This method base analysis metabolic profile excise tissue technique High-Resolution Magic-Angle Spinning ( HR-MAS ) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . Indeed HRMAS NMR method provide sufficiently short time lapse ( currently 30 minute within project time lapse 15 min even less ultimately intend ) , medical information complement obtain classic histological examination . Primary purpose : The main objective study determine sensitivity HRMAS NMR spectroscopy detect residual tumor infiltration brain resection cavity . The investigator aim determine relevance metabolic analysis compare histological analysis neurosurgery operation . This involve analyze excise tissue sample , obtain operating room Strasbourg University Hospitals , Colmar Hospital Center , return neurosurgeon surgery . Secondary purpose : The secondary objective protocol investigate metabolome different type brain tumor , order find prognostic diagnostic marker . It consist detect metabolomic factor bad prognosis , potential marker good prognosis IDH mutation .</brief_summary>
