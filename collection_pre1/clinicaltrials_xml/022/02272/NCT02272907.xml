	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize staple line reinforcement result high leak pressure non-reinforced staple line closure resect gastric specimen laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . The primary endpoint study leak pressure various staple line treatment . The investigator also analyze common site specimen leak , association stomach thickness leak , association stomach thickness performance staple line technique , cost analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate mechanical strength various staple line reinforcement technique use resected portion stomach patient undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . The specimen collect time surgery , previous staple line excise , new staple line one investigatory reinforcement procedure apply . The staple line technique use study include non-buttressed non-imbricated oversewing , non-buttressed imbricated suture line , buttress stapling , reinforcement ( see protocol description ) . The specimen take morgue experimental procedure perform within 6 hour specimen procurement . The specimen attach catheter pressure monitor blue dye instill specimen leakage see . The presence leakage indicate failure staple line . Detailed measurement specimen perform leak pressure location specimen leak occur . The specimen turn pathology undergo routine pathologic examination . This experimental procedure use previously publish literature animal sample , never human tissue . A possible reason lack test stomach staple line patient sleeve gastrectomy technical aspect bariatric surgery develop use gastric bypass ; procedure stomach divide excise . The investigator hypothesize specimen treat staple line buttress material fail high pressure without reinforcement . The investigator also explore location failure determine consistent site weakness . Should study yield consistent result , would help determine standard approach staple line reinforcement laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . Additionally , location leak consistent , information may help drive technical change could decrease leak rate , infrequent potentially devastate risk weight loss surgery .</detailed_description>
