	<brief_title>Temple University Employees With Musculoskeletal Conditions Receive Physical Therapy Treat Limitations Early</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally , individual sustain musculoskeletal injury require physical therapy intervention , referral obtain physician prescribe therapy . Currently , non-work related injury , 48 50 United States `` direct access physical therapy state '' mean consumer evaluate treated physical therapist directly without physician referral . The number direct access state much less work-related injury , 17 50 United States practice act permit direct access , , insurance company still require physician referral reimbursement . A previous systematic review literature topic suggest require referral associate drug prescription , image order , high cost patient health care system advantage health outcome . However , cite study low quality ( i.e . Level 1 evidence ) , high quality study strict experimental control still necessary . This project propose conduct blind randomize control trial determine `` direct access physical therapy portal entry '' effective `` physician portal entry '' decrease total episode cost improve outcome individual recent onset musculoskeletal condition . The project 's definition musculoskeletal pain `` mechanical '' spine extremity pain either work condition ( worker compensation ) non-work related condition . The project investigator plan recruit potential subject directly Temple University employee supervisor . Subjects consent pas baseline screen randomize one two group : direct access physical therapy management Employee Health physician management . All PT physician provider `` study provider '' . Subjects randomize direct access physical therapy evaluate treated physical therapist . If presentation require work , therapist refer patient image specialty consult . Subjects randomize Employee Health physician receive similar evaluation order relevant work , appropriate , physician refer patient physical therapist . Health outcomes two group compare mixed-model repeated measure analysis 1 month enrollment . Total episode cost medical utilization compare one year enrollment . If direct access `` Temple University model '' feasible effective managing compensate non-compensated musculoskeletal condition , could serve paradigm university implement across United States . Furthermore , study would first data set literature study physical therapy direct access model evaluation treatment employee `` workers-compensation '' condition United States .</detailed_description>
