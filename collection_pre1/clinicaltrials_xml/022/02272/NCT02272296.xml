	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Insulin administration jet injector needle-free alternative conventional administration insulin insulin pen syrinx . Jet injector deliver insulin high velocity ( typically &gt; 100m/s ) across skin subcutaneous tissue dispense insulin large area insulin inject syringe . This significantly accelerate absorption rapid-acting insulin subcutaneous area systemic circulation . Reproducibility insulin effect essential , easily overlook , issue product need administer frequently daily practice . When identical dos aspart insulin injected common syringe two different day separate least week , intra-individual inter-individual variability various pharmacokinetic -dynamic parameter find vary 11-21 % 18-36 % , respectively . Reproducibility investigate insulin administer jet injector . The investigator previous study indicate small between-subjects variability insulin absorption injection jet injector injection conventional pen , provide evidence reproducibility least comparable , potentially even well use jet injector . The aim present research proposal compare variability metabolic effect insulin aspart administer jet injection inject conventional insulin pen , control experimental condition . An additional aim investigate pharmacokinetic -dynamic comparability regular soluble insulin inject jet stream device aspart insulin administer conventional pen . The reason investigator want investigate comparability rapid-acting insulin analog worldwide available costly compare regular insulin . If could achieve pharmacological benefit rapid act insulin less costly type insulin , would great benefit patient diabetes less developed country . 2 . Hypotheses The variability metabolic effect insulin administer subcutaneously jet injection similar well insulin administer conventional insulin pen . The investigator also hypothesize metabolic effect soluble insulin administer jet injection similar insulin aspart administer conventional insulin pen . 3 . Study Population For study , total 30 healthy volunteer recruit . Subjects potentially eligible 18 50 year age good clinical condition . Additional participant recruit case drop-out . 4 . Investigational medicinal product Main study : Insulin aspart ( Novorapid® Penfill 100 units/ml , 3 ml ampoule ) : rapid-acting analogue human insulin . Sub-study : Regular Human Insulin ( Humulin® Penfill 100 units/ml , 3ml ampoule ) : human regular insulin . 5 . Summary know potential risk benefit Novorapid® insulin indicate treatment diabetes mellitus adult , adolescent child age 2 year . The study comprise risk hypoglycemia . However , risk hypoglycaemia experiment negligible , since glucose measure 5-10 minute interval additional glucose administer glucose level tend drop 4.8 mmol/l . Intravenous glucose 20 % may cause local irritation occasionally phlebitis . 6 . Methods 6.1 Randomisation The study randomise control parallel design . Randomisation do computer program use block two subject , randomize two device contain insulin placebo solution . This ensure equal number subject experiment investigational product ( InsujetTM pen ) control device ( Novopen® IV insulin pen ) . To ensure blinding , pen device prepare nurse otherwise involved conducting experiment . There indication prematurely break randomisation code , subject receive amount insulin one two device experiment , frequent glucose-monitoring prevent hypoglycemia . 6.2 Study procedure Potentially eligible study participant recruit use website use RUMC social medium . Should insufficient , advertisement local newspaper place . Eligibility determine screen visit medical interview physical examination . Experimental procedure All participant examine two occasion , within 1 week , one two device contain insulin device placebo device . Patients instructed consume low-glycemic index meal even experiment remain fasting condition 20:00 hour onwards . On first second experimental day , participant admit research unit 08.00 hour fast condition abstain smoking , alcohol use caffeine use least 24 hour . A catheter insert retrograde fashion dorsal hand vein frequent blood sampling , whereby hand place inside heat box ( air temperature , ~55°C ) arterialize venous blood . Another catheter insert antecubital vein arm , keep patent saline drip , use administration 20 % glucose . After cannulation , blood take direct measurement plasma glucose store later measurement plasma insulin level . Thereafter , independent research nurse administer insulin dose 0.2 unit per kg body weight subcutaneously abdominal site , either jet injector ( InsujetTM ) conventional pen ( Novopen® IV ) . The device use insulin administration prepare research nurse well . However , device empty although patient look feel way pen fill insulin . The insulin injection simulate injection give simultaneously . After injection , administration site cover research nurse bandage prevent investigator patient able see whether remained insulin skin . The investigator well participant blind pen contains insulin pen placebo device . Subsequently , 6-hour normoglycemic glucose clamp employ , describe previously . To end , glucose 20 % administer intravenously sufficient rate maintain normoglycemia , base plasma glucose level measure 5-minute interval first 3 hour 10-minute interval remainder experiment . Also , blood drawn store -80°C every 5 minute first hour insulin injection every 15 minute hour thereafter later determination plasma insulin C-peptide level . During last four hour , insulin measure 30 minute interval . Six hour insulin injection , experiment terminate patient give meal . The total duration study day , include preparation recovery time , 7 hour . Participants ask separately return research unit third time similar 6-hour normoglycemic glucose clamp . On occasion , insulin aspart replace regular soluble insulin . The insulin administer jet injector . Pharmacokinetic -dynamic data obtain experiment compare data obtain injection aspart insulin conventional pen study previous investigation . The investigator also ask subject experimental day , within 30 minute insulin injection , point numeric rating scale 0 10 amount discomfort pain ease use experience two administration method . After second experiment day , patient ask two device would prefer insulin injection , choice . Withdrawal study subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study case severe adverse event another condition require immediate medical care . Appropriate follow treatment withdrawn subject assure . Every subject withdraws study replace additional study participant . Premature termination study The study terminate prematurely unexpected serious adverse event experience endanger subject . If trial prematurely terminate investigator promptly inform trial subject , METC competent authority . A detailed write explanation termination provide . Appropriate follow treatment trial subject assure . 7 . Safety report The investigator inform subject review accredit METC anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit METC , except insofar suspension would jeopardise subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep inform . All ( serious ) adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investigator staff record report METC . 8 . Statistical analysis Descriptive parameter present mean ± standard error mean . Unpaired T-tests perform compare main secondary study endpoint well ease use safety endpoint . A Chi2 test use compare number patient experience post injection hypoglycaemia two injection device . A P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS 20.0 high . 9 . Administrative aspect , monitor publication The investigator preserve confidentiality subject take part study , accordance GCP local regulation . The investigator must ensure subject anonymity maintain . Al data material one individual subject cod unique identification code . The key code maintain investigator research nurse . The validated data management system Castor use data handling , accord GCP . Data store 15 year . Human material store 10 year . Source document database verification perform independent monitor , accord predefined monitoring plan . There minimal monitoring , per year , study judge cause marginal potential risk participant . 10 . Public disclosure publication policy This study make possible unrestricted grant European Pharma Group ( EPG ) , division Needle Free Insulin Products , manufacturer InsujetTM jet-injector . EPG involve study design write protocol also involve conduct study , analysis data , presentation result , write manuscript decision submit publication .</detailed_description>
