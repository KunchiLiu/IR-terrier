	<brief_title>Bariatric Lap Band Surgery Treatment Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study 15 ( may need consent/screen 30 patient 15 enrol ) obese patient ( BMI 30-40 ) painful knee osteoarthritis . Although prior study report musculoskeletal secondary outcome follow various type bariatric surgery , investigator propose evaluation laparoscopic gastric banding ( LAGB ) treat cohort patient moderate severe knee osteoarthritis . Once eligible patient identify rheumatologist and/or bariatric team consent study , bilateral knee radiograph ( standard care ) ensure sufficient degree OA . Patients refer bariatric surgeon , confirm patient ' interest , understand suitability LAGB surgery FDA approve procedurefor patient BMI &gt; 30 least one obesity-related comorbidity ( include knee OA ) 37 . It application approve procedure constitutes research question LAGB surgery consider treatment option improve pain physical disability patient knee OA ? During pre-operative process patient give study questionnaire evaluate knee pain function , musculoskeletal exam blood/urine collected.These procedure repeat post-operative interval track response knee LAGB . The primary outcome measure improvement OA-related knee pain physical disability . Improvement pain function define change VAS , WOMAC , AORC KOOS score . The degree improvement require qualify describe method section . Secondary outcome measure include ( 1 ) radiographic evidence OA progression worsen despite LABG , ( 2 ) weight loss , ( 3 ) reduction discontinuation pain medication .</detailed_description>
