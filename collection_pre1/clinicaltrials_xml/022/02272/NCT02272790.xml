	<detailed_description>This phase II study AZD1775 plus chemotherapy patient platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Patients receive AZD1775 plus carboplatin AZD1775 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) . The primary endpoint study overall response rate ( ORR ) define proportion patient achieve complete partial tumour response accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) v1.1 . Secondary endpoint include assessment duration response ( DoR ) , overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) cancer antigen-125 response , safety tolerability , clinically significant change safety-related laboratory parameter , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) drug-drug interaction AZD1775 plus carboplatin AZD1775 plus PLD . Six ( 6 ) patient enrol AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm ( designated Arm C ) dose escalation scheme safety lead-in cohort . When safe tolerable dose AZD1775 combination carboplatin determine , 17 additional patient enrol treated dose level . Patients may continue study long benefitting , evidence disease progression , meet criterion discontinuation withdrawal . Up 12 patient enrol AZD1775 plus PLD arm ( designated Arm D ) dose escalation scheme safety lead-in cohort . Dose expansion conduct Arm D. Patients may continue study long benefitting , evidence disease progression , meet criterion discontinuation withdrawal . A Safety Review Team ( SRT ) ass safety tolerability first 6 patient arm incidence severity adverse event ( AEs ) minimum 1 treatment cycle determine NCI CTCAE v4.03 occurrence pre-defined dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) . Patients must complete Cycle 1 safety evaluation , return study centre Cycle 2 Day 1 evaluation consider evaluable safety lead-in . Following positive safety assessment AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm ( Arm C ) SRT , Arm C continue enrol 23 patient evaluate efficacy ( i.e. , tumour response ) . Enrollment continue Arm D .</detailed_description>
