	<detailed_description>The utility NVM5 neuromonitoring stimulate within surgical site XLIF previously demonstrate ; however , possible depend site injury , method monitoring may stimulate nerve location distal site injury along nerve conduction pathway . In example , site injury would disrupt stimulus normal muscle response may occur , provide false negative result . With mind , hypothesize accurate information may gather stimulate lumbar root spinal nerve cranial surgical site record subsequent muscle response low limb . Using technique , response stimulus would traverse surgical site , include site nerve injury . Currently , describe method stimulating cranial surgical site transcranial motor evoke potential ( tcMEP ) ; stimulate lumbosacral nerve root locally demonstrate . Though tcMEP monitor well-documented technique , several limitation associate use . For example , tcMEP require adherence total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , thereby restrict use inhalational agent . This restriction may require additional training coordination anesthesiologist , well add cost hospital.6 Additional challenge tcMEP include requirement high voltage stimulation successfully transmit stimulus across skull . In rare instance cause seizure , tongue laceration , complication . Finally , due inclusion central nervous system , monitor tcMEP may less reproducible specific localize stimulation . To address challenge , recent adaptation standard MEP EMG monitoring protocol use local stimulation lumbosacral nerve root level conus , record response relevant innervated muscle group low limb . Early experience use technique show feasibility reproducibility obtain reliable baseline longitudinal response throughout surgical procedure , incorporation monitoring modality become common practice certain surgical site perform XLIF , although determination clinically meaningful change response yet determine .</detailed_description>
