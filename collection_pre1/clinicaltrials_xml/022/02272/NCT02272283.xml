	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease one prevalent diseases western country . A waxy substance call plaque build inside coronary artery . Over time , plaque harden rupture , cause narrowing ( stenosis ) arteries reduce flow oxygen-rich blood heart . The standard treatment symptomatic coronary stenosis percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) balloon dilation follow stent implantation . A stent small metallic grid stabilize coronary vessel wall balloon dilation . Currently , drug-eluting stent ( DES ) widely use stent type . DESs consist metallic backbone antiprolifetive drug-coating bound polymer ( glue ) . These device reduce incidence excessive formation new tissue ( in-stent restenosis ) dramatically comparison previously use bare-metal stent . However , `` safety concern '' DES , since later thrombotic event report . On one hand excessive tissue formation inside stent cause in-stent restenosis , hand insufficient coverage stent cause persistently expose metalllic material induce platelet aggregation thrombus-formation . The etiology stent thrombosis multifactorial . Possible predisposing factor , among others : 1 ) hypersensitivity towards polymer-coating , may induce delayed heal inside around stent , 2 ) insufficient contact stent underlie coronary vessel wall ( incomplete stent apposition ) , may cause flow-disturbance delay healing . Delayed heal cause persistently expose metallic material induce platelet aggregation thrombus-formation . The Nobori stent new-generation DES , coat thin layer drug bioabsorbable polymer . The drug localize out side stent , decrease release drug blood circulation . The bioabsorbable polymer degrade 6-9 month implantation , decrease risk hypersensitivity-reactions vessel wall . The improved pharmacokinetic profile stent think improve heal pattern . At routine coronary angiography , small plastic tube insert femoral artery local anesthesia . Thin , flexible catheter advance artery system ( femoral artery aorta ) coronary artery . Contrast inject blood stream catheter , artery depict special X-ray technique dye-release . By angiography , out side coronary artery visualize , balloon dilation stent implantation guide standard technique . Newer study document stent placement expansion superiorly visualize supplementary intravascular imaging perform stent implantation . Small image catheter wire vessel stent implantation , film stent retrogradely vessel . Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) visualize complete vessel wall use sound wave , stent expansion evaluate detail . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) new light-based , high-resolution technology . The technique depict every thread ( strut ) stent , enable visualization contact strut underlying vessel wall immediately procedure , strut coverage follow-up . The purpose study determine whether OCT-guided PCI improve heal coverage stent comparison routine angiographic guidance alone patient indicate PCI due myocardial infarction . If OCT-guidance improves coverage stent , might lower later thrombotic risk . Patients hospitalize due myocardial infarction randomize either OCT-guided angio-guided stent implantation present study . In group Nobori stent implant accord standard technique . In angio-guided group , implantation guide angiography alone . OCT- IVUS analysis perform angiographic optimal result documentary reason . The operator blind towards image finding , analysis perform offline later . In OCT-guided group , OCT IVUS analysis interpret immediately acquisition . If stent apposition and/or expansion deem suboptimal , additional balloon dilation and/or stenting perform . In case OCT-driven stent optimization , documentary OCT IVUS perform document final result . Patients readmitted 6 month later control angiogram inclusive OCT ass stent coverage . Furthermore , patient readmitted 12 month index procedure control angiogram include OCT IVUS assess dynamic vessel wall response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) reduce rate in-stent restenosis dramatically comparison bare-metal stent ( BMS ) . Still , `` safety concern '' form late late stent thrombosis . Multifactorial predictor may associate later thrombotic event , delay arterial healing document powerful predispose factor previous histo-pathological study . Culprit lesions patient DES-implantation due myocardial infarction associate substantial delay arterial heal comparison patient DES-implantation due stable coronary artery disease . Numerous procedural factor also significant importance regard sufficient coronary vessel wall healing . Particularly , acute incomplete stent apposition ( ISA ) strong procedural risk factor delay coverage . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) high-resolution intravascular imaging modality , enable detailed in-vivo assessment immediate stenting result vascular healing pattern , include strut coverage , follow-up . Some procedural factor modify use OCT-guidance , potentially leading decrease proportion uncover struts follow-up . The hypothesis study OCT-guided PCI reduce incidence acute late ISA , thereby provide improved strut coverage follow Nobori-stent implantation . The objective study ass whether OCT-guided optimization follow Nobori stent implantation patient Non ST segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( NSTEMI ) improve coronary vascular response comparison routine angiographic guidance alone . The present study design prospective , randomized trial conduct single center ( Odense University Hospital ) . One-hundred patient enrol ( Between August 2011 May 2013 ) . Prior PCI procedure , patient load 300 mg dose aspirin , load dose 180 mg ticagrelor . An unfractionated heparin dose ( 70 IU/kg ) administer PCI-procedure . In case third-generation biolimus-eluting stent ( Nobori , Terumo , Tokyo , Japan ) implant . Stents implant accord standard technique . Recommended post-procedure dual antiplatelet regimens 75 mg aspirin daily lifelong 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily 1 year . Post-implantation , acquisition angiographic optimal result , patient randomly assign 1:1 either : 1 ) OCT-guided PCI , 2 ) angio-guided PCI . Random assignment distribute sealed envelope . Both treatment arm post-procedure OCT IVUS perform administration 200 microgram intracoronary nitroglycerin . It possible blind operator , investigator patient allocate implantation technique , operator blind post-procedure OCT- IVUS image angio-guided group , operator screen-side turn , entire pullback remain uncommented . In OCT-guided group , image interpret online dedicate OCT-analyst PCI-operator . If post-procedure OCT reveal : 1 ) expansion stent minimal stent area ( MSA ) &lt; 90 % distal/proximal reference vessel lumen area , and/or 2 ) significant acute ISA ( define equal 3 strut per cross sectional area detach 140 micron ( thickness strut + drug/polymer coating ) ) underlie vessel wall , and/or 3 ) edge dissection ( ) cause significant reduction minimal lumen area ( ) ( MLA &lt; 4 mm2 ) and/or 4 ) significant residual stenosis ( MLA &lt; 4 mm2 ) proximal and/or distal reference segment ( ) additional intervention encourage . The degree optimization base upon OCT finding leave judgement PCI-operator . Patients schedule 6-months clinical invasive ( include angiogram OCT ) 12-months clinical invasive ( include angiogram , OCT IVUS ) follow-up . Prior follow-up imaging , 5,000 IU unfractionated heparin 200 microgram intracoronary nitroglycerin administer .
