	<brief_summary>Metastatic seminoma relatively uncommon disease . The widely use treatment disease chemotherapy drug , cisplatin etoposide without addition bleomycin . This treatment combination show good survival rate however toxic usually require inpatient visit administration three day cause significant nausea , malaise , alopecia , risk kidney damage , hypertension high tone hearing loss . Previous study demonstrate carboplatin also effective treat disease type . Progression free survival less see combination chemotherapy yet overall survival two treatment effectiveness second line salvage chemotherapy . Single agent carboplatin less toxic treatment convenient give day case . A recent study run Orchid Clinical Trials Group look whether carboplatin ( AUC10 ) associate few side effect , convenient give outpatient treatment comparable term cure rate . 20 patient recruit trial result encourage one relapsed patient . This patient go cured conventional treatment . The positive outcome AUC10 trial lead design new multi centre study . This open label , multi centre trial recruit 50 patient good prognosis metastatic seminoma . All patient receive three cycle carboplatin AUC 10 . Patients follow survival closely monitored side effect treatment . Patients PET-CT scan start treatment completion first cycle . We hope scan help u identify patient respond metabolically therefore require extra cycle chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
