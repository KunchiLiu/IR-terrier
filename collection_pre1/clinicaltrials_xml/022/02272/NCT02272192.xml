	<brief_summary>A multi-site randomized study intensive treatment toddler autism . This project propose three-site collaborative network plus data coordinate center evaluate effect intervention intensity intervention style deliver 12 month , developmental quotient ( primary outcome ) young child ASD age 12-30 month old family , effect child 's initial vocal skill , developmental rate autism severity response intervention . A second study examine whether effect Early Start Denver Model intervention sustain three year period 6-7 year old child previously enrol two year study compare ESDM treatment usual community intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High quality , intensive early intervention powerful treatment ASD , improve IQ language markedly randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCTs ) , though little long term follow-up data exists . Few core characteristic affect child change test . Two potential core characteristic invoke considerable debate among parent , professional , administrator delivery style intervention : play-based versus discrete trial teaching , intensity ( dosage ) intervention . This ACE treatment network conduct two RCTs answer two main question : study 1 : effect intensity delivery style developmental progress toddler ASD , study 2 : toddler previous RCT specific intervention approach , Early Start Denver Model ( ESDM ) , versus community treatment maintain generalize treatment effect 3 year ? A sample 108 young child ASD , age 15-30 month live within specify radius near university site enrol one three national site ( Univ Cal Davis , Vanderbilt , Univ . Washington ) randomize one four cell vary two dimension : dosage - 15 25 hour per week 1:1 treatment ; discrete trial teach play routines- base teaching . Other aspect intervention hold constant : use principle apply behavior analysis , intensity , parent coaching assign treatment , location . Developmental progress measure monthly allow growth curve analysis examine fine-grained difference group well interaction among major child family initial variable two experimental variable .</detailed_description>
