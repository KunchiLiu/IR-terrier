	<brief_summary>Protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) include moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM : weight-for-height z-score &lt; -2 -3 , mid upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) 115 &lt; 125 mm ) major cause morbidity mortality under-5 child developing/low-income country . Approximately 14.6 % under-5 mortality worldwide attribute MAM . Prevalence MAM among under-5 child Bangladesh ~12 % ( ~1.7 million ) . Providing diet contain adequate nutrient mainstay treatment child MAM . Dietary protein mostly derive vegetable source middle low income population among prevalence MAM form PEM high . It possible process fish fish peptide longer shelf-life without refrigerator , know 'fish Surimi ' consume different category people need well-balanced protein ; could attractive alternative supply fish protein diet child low-income country like Bangladesh . Fish Surimi peptide break white fish meat use plant-derived enzyme ingredient fish meat consist 20 different kind amino acid include nine essential amino acid . In human study find help lower blood lipid , glucose , IgE , hypertension , increase serum albumin total protein , bone density . The present study design assess acceptability efficacy 'fish Surimi ' 2-5 year old child suffer MAM . A pilot study two phase : ass ) acceptability small convenience sample ( N=30 ) ( phase 1 ) ; ii ) efficacy ( rate weight gain ) fish peptide small convenience sample ( N=70 : 35 intervention 35 control ) ( phase 2 ) propose . Acceptability trial ( first phase ) : The investigator conduct study study ward Dhaka Hospital icddr , b . For child study two day : i.e . direct observation food intake two lunch two supper . In randomly manner cross design , individual child offer 5g fish Surimi lunch 5g supper one day meal without fish peptide day blind manner . The investigator observe completeness eagerness eat possible side effect ( e.g . allergy , vomit , diarrhea etc . ) two day . Pilot efficacy trial ( second phase ) : The investigator conduct pilot trial ass efficacy ( mainly child weight gain ) fish Surimi give home various foods/meals 2-5 year old child MAM conduct Dhaka City Bangladesh . Children enrol Dhaka Hospital icddr , b improvement acute illness . The intervention group receive ( take home supplementation ) two-week 's ration fish Surimi ( @ 10g/day two dos i.e . 5g + 5g airtight packet ) , serve twice daily mixed family diet . The control group provide supplement parent give dietary advice provide nutritious food child adequate amount , child group receive micronutrient sprinkle . The child 's guardian supply fish Surimi initial discharge icddr , b hospital request come fortnightly follow nutrition follow-up unit ( NFU ) icddr , b . During follow-up visit study research assistant/health worker anthropometry , collect morbidity history since last visit/follow dietary history also take find child along fish Surimi intake . Treatment illness provide per standard method duty physician Dhaka Hospital icddr , b . The ration next two week provide way child follow ~ 3 month six NFU-follow-up visit . To reduce possible drop-out both-way transportation cost ( ~ 150 250 taka ) follow-up visit reimburse guardian . In middle two schedule follow-up day research assistant call family cell phone monitor child 's feeding morbidity status . Approximately 5ml blood collect ante-cubital vein child biochemical test enrolment end 3 month analyze haemoglobin ( Hb ) , c-reactive protein , zinc , ferritin , albumin , total protein , IgE . During blood draw day child give toy ( take home ) .</brief_summary>
