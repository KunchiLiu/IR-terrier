	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , tumor tissue blood sample test molecular profiling . Molecular profile classification tissue base expression certain gene within tumor compare normal tissue . This may use predict tumor responds therapy . Your doctor may use result molecular profile help decide treatment might beneficial disease . Study Procedures : Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw tumor biopsy biopsy normal tissue enroll study . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw 2-3 week begin treatment . The type biopsy depend type disease . The risk procedure discuss detail . If enough tissue study doctor perform study test ( describe ) , may need second biopsy . The study staff discus need . Treatment Arms : A series test find gene mutation , , perform . Depending result molecular testing , may enrol 1 2 arm . If molecular profile show gene mutation may benefit study drug believe target gene mutation , enrol Arm A receive target drug . If molecular profile show gene mutation , enrol Arm B . In Arm B , doctor choose therapy base study rather gene mutation . Length Study : This study last 2 year . Your participation study complete last blood draw tumor biopsy collect . This investigational study . Up 200 participant take part study . Up 50 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Informed consent 2 . Any histologic type metastatic cancer , ( except lung brain US sit ) , histologic normal counterpart obtain . See list cancer type include trial Appendix 1 . 3 . Progression RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ) criteria least one prior regimen advance disease 4 . Ability undergo biopsy surgical procedure obtain fresh tumor biopsy pair normal counterpart 5 . Age 18 year 6 . Life expectancy least 3 month 7 . ECOG Performance status 0 1 8 . Measurable evaluable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion 9 . For US site : advanced cancer patient exhaust effective therapy disease progress previous line therapy ( documented disease progression last treatment receive ) conventional method assign new therapy would expect increase survival 3 month . 1 . For US site : Any patient might require lung brain biopsy exclude 2 . Alteration organ function hematopoietic function define follow criterion : 1 . Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , except patient liver metastasis , AST ALT &gt; 5.0 ULN exclusion criterion . 2 .

Patient receive personalized therapeutic treatment base molecular anomaly treatment period immediately prior WINTHER direct treatment ( define PFS1 ) . Hormonal therapy may continue WINTHER suggest therapy . The exclusion prior match target therapy include limited targeted therapeutic EMA approve genomically match patient . If question whether prior therapy match targeted treatment agree discussion PIs also Clinical Management Committee member ; resolution take place prior start Winther direct treatment .</criteria>
