	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Post Stem Cell Transplantation ( SCT ) Double-Hit B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If take part study , take ibrutinib mouth 1 time day 3 year . You must swallow capsule whole glass ( 8 ounce ) water . Do open , break , chew capsule . You take ibrutinib time every day . If miss dose ibrutinib , take soon remember day . Take next dose ibrutinib regular time next day . Do take 2 dos ibrutinib day make miss dose . You give study drug diary write time take dose ibrutinib . You need bring study drug diary , leftover study drug , empty study drug container visit . The dose ibrutinib receive may lower , doctor think need . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time Weeks 1-4 , 6 , 8 1 time month 3 year first dose ibrutinib , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check kidney liver function . The blood draw may perform MD Anderson lab close home . If study doctor think need , may need blood draw often . Around 1 month first dose ibrutinib , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease , study doctor think need . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Around 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 3 year first dose ibrutinib : - You physical exam . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan check status disease . - You bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 3 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 3 year . Follow-Up Visit : You continue CT scan blood draw describe study visit section 1 time year 3 year . If positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan perform time transplant scan show disease still body , PET scan 1 time year take ibrutinib . The PET scan repeat result show disease body . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA-approved commercially available treatment many type cancer , include mantle cell lymphoma 1 prior therapy . The use ibrutinib treat double hit lymphoma autologous stem cell transplant consider investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
