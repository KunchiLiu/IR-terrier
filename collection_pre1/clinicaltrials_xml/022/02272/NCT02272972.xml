	<detailed_description>5 surgeon 5 clinic participate include total 125 prospective 125 retrospective case . This mean 25+25 case per clinic 5+5 case treat surgeon . The anonymized image surgeon 's last 5 patient ( retrospective part ) pseudonymized image next 5 patient meet eligibility criterion ( prospective part ) assess . Patients eligible least 18 year old , AO 31-A1 , A2 A3 fracture treat either Proximal Femoral nail Antirotation ( PFNA ) , PFNA- II , Dynamic Hip Screw ( DHS ) Titanium Trochanteric Fixation Nail System ( TFN ) . Individually , 5 surgeon per clinic review 25 postimplant intraoperative lateral image file 5 retrospective case use set predefined criterion . After first assessment retrospective case , group watch video poster one hour time discus . The group review 25 case pre-education step within period maximum 5 day . The data analyze AO Clinical Investigation Documentation ( AOCID ) provide surgeon data review meeting agree area improvement set target goal prospective series . For whole period second assessment prospective series , poster place area operating room . After patient information/consent , eligible patient include prospective part study treat either intramedullary nail DHS . During surgery , surgeon use newly achieve knowledge record image . In next step , 5 surgeon per clinic review individually 25 postimplant intraoperative lateral image 5 prospective case use set predefined criterion . The data analyze AOCID review Imaging Working Group AO Education . The data transfer clinic . The main outcome assess base `` Questionnaire assessment lateral intraoperative view proximal femur '' . This questionnaire consist seven question , image quality ( Q1 Q2 ; part A ) quality reduction surgery ( Q3 - Q7 ; part B ) . Q1 Q2 allow `` yes/no '' answer , option comment answer `` '' . Q3 Q5 base anatomical assessment Q6 Q7 ask evaluation surgery . There `` assessable '' answer option question part B .</detailed_description>
