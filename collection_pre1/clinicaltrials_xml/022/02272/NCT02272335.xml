	<brief_summary>The main goal propose study test whether successful stress management intervention effectively implement natural setting community acceptable community dwell , low income population African American woman breast cancer . Hypothesis 1 : There difference woman randomize either Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management ( CBSM ) Cancer Wellness Education condition ( CW ) rating acceptability program . Hypothesis 2 : Women randomize CBSM condition show great decrease time cancer-specific distress great increase time quality life compare woman CW condition course study baseline six month follow-up . Hypothesis 3 : Women randomize CBSM condition show great improvement pain level , sleep disturbance fatigue compare woman CW condition course study baseline six month follow-up . Hypothesis 4 : Women randomize CBSM condition report few sick day , early return work , few unanticipated health care visit , few visit Emergency Department good follow-up oncologist compare woman CW condition course study baseline six month follow-up . Hypothesis 5 : Women randomize CBSM condition show normalize pattern diurnal cortisol ( e.g. , great increase negative AM-PM slope ) compare woman CW condition course study baseline six month follow-up . Hypothesis 6 : Women randomize CBSM condition show less normalized pattern heart rate variability ( e.g. , variation ) compare woman CW condition course study baseline six month follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitating Adjustment Low Income Black Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minority woman grossly underserved suffer poor quality life treatment breast cancer . Despite great need , intervention design foster adaptation disease among woman scarce . Our recent randomize trial test efficacy 10-week multi-modal , group-based , cognitive behavioral stress management ( CBSM ) intervention deliver university setting among woman breast cancer recently complete adjuvant treatment . Using panel psychological , physiological , physical indicator adaptation , investigator examine whether intervention facilitate `` recovery '' adaptation adjuvant therapy breast cancer complete . CBSM intervention participant show improvement multiple indicator psychosocial adaptation ( few intrusive thought , low anxiety , less social disruption , less negative affect , positive affect , great benefit finding , high level positive state mind ) , physiological adaptation ( decreased cortisol increase cellular immune function Th1 cytokine production ) physical adaptation disease ( less fatigue improve sleep quality ) . Many finding hold 3 9 month follow-ups . As psychosocial oncology research , participant randomize trial mostly non-Hispanic White woman . Whether result trial generalizable large population include minority woman needs test . The propose research aim translate University-based , CBSM intervention format acceptable effective community set . The investigator target effort toward low-income African American woman , ( n=120 attrition ) diagnose breast cancer ( stage disease ) . Participants randomize 10-week CBSM intervention attention time-matched Enhanced Breast Cancer Wellness Education ( CW ) active comparison-control condition monitor 6 month afterward . Outcomes include : ( ) acceptability intervention , ( b ) psychosocial adaptation , ( c ) physical symptom cluster , ( ) economic implication ( e ) objective indicator stress ( diurnal salivary cortisol ) . The main goal test whether successful stress-management intervention effectively implement natural setting community acceptable community-dwelling , low-income population African American woman breast cancer . Specific Aim 1 : To examine acceptability empirically-validated stress management intervention community-dwelling low-income African American woman breast cancer . Specific Aim 2 : To test prediction participant randomize CBSM intervention show significant improvement indices psychosocial adaptation ( i.e. , cancer-specific distress , quality life ) relative woman randomize CW attention control condition across study period . Specific Aim 3 : To test prediction participant randomize CBSM intervention show significant improvement index physical symptom cluster relative woman randomize CW attention control condition across study period ( physical symptom cluster include pain , sleep , fatigue ) . Specific Aim 4 : To test prediction woman randomize CBSM intervention versus CW attention control condition well economic outcome across study period ( measure faster return work , few sick day , few health care visit ) . Specific Aim 5 : To test prediction participant randomize CBSM intervention show significant improvement index physiological adaptation relative woman randomize CW attention control condition across study period examine diurnal salivary cortisol objective measure stress .</detailed_description>
