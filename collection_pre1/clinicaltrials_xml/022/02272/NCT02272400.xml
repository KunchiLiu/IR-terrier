	<brief_summary>Partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) become new paradigm breast cancer radiation . [ 1 ] No type I II evidence currently available demonstrate equivalence standard whole breast radiotherapy , prospective randomize trial jointly sponsor NSABP RTOG ( NSABP B-39 RTOG 0413 ) currently accrue patient , compare whole breast radiotherapy PBI , either brachytherapy external beam technique ( EB ) . Until result similar trial available , PBI remain research domain , offer patient context clinical experimental protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite fact less extensive experience brachytherapy available , PBI delivery external-beam many advantage . First , likely acceptable patient since non-invasive require surgical procedure anesthesia . Moreover , since deliver surgery , pathological analysis segmental mastectomy specimen available inform selection best candidate . In addition , EB-PBI likely become widely reproducible , since rely experience skill radiation oncologist perform brachytherapy implant . Besides , technique establish , widely apply facility provide linear accelerator , without risk present brachytherapy approach complete unfavorable interplay patient 's anatomy technical limitation applicator . Finally , term health care economics , external beam approach spar cost extra surgical procedure several day hospitalization ( case LDR brachytherapy ) .</detailed_description>
