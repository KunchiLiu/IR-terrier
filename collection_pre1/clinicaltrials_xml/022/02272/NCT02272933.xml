	<brief_title>Operability Implementation Patient Motion Monitoring System Using Wireless Body Worn Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical monitoring system become important area research development due possibility allow improve quality life care reduce overall medical cost . Significance study : The study significant allow researcher understand efficacy autonomous sensor system use actual resident geriatric care center . This study one first attempt monitor movement geriatric resident go activity daily live . This type system potential improve quality life safety geriatric patient . Goals : The development autonomous patient monitoring technology eventually improve quality life safety patient geriatric care facility environment . Determine performance usability wearable sensor system geriatric care facility actual resident go daily life . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine performance motion data collect ion system monitor geriatric resident go daily life geriatric center 2 . Determine tolerability wear sensor geriatric resident 3 . Understand medical staff interacts monitor resident sensor device 4 . Determine sensor system 's algorithm identify fall Objectives : 1 . Analyze motion data generate system determine system performance . The list performance metric include : ( ) system up-time , ( b ) continuity data collection ( c ) sensor device failure rate , ( ) sensor device battery life ( e ) simultaneous collection data multiple monitor resident localized area . 2 . Assess tolerability wear device course day use survey administer resident . 3 . Assess usability sensor system use survey administer care giver . 4 . Compare event flag fall system algorithms fall log produce Garrison staff , cross-verified personal fall log , determine ability system detect fall .</detailed_description>
