It possess antioxidant , antimicrobial anticancer effect . In addition , honey expensive . The aim study evaluate effect 12-week honey consumption child acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) particularly regard FN episodes . This randomize crossover clinical trial include 40 patient sex , age 2.5 10 year . They randomize two equal group [ intervention control ( I/C ) control intervention ( C/I ) ] .

	<detailed_description>This crossover randomize study take place Children Hospital Ain Shams University-Cairo-Egypt , March 2011 August 2013 . The patient recruit Hematology-Oncology Clinic hospital . All patient &gt; 2 year age acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , treat accord Modified CCG 1991 protocol standard- risk ALL maintenance therapy , candidate study . Patients diabetes mellitus ( DM ) patient febrile neutropenia time enrollment exclude study . A crossover design ( two 12-week intervention period ) use measure honey effect . The subject randomize two equal group ( group A control intervention [ C/I ] group group B intervention control [ I/C ] group ) . A computer-generated list random number use allocate participant equally group . Since previous similar study , pre-specified sample size determine . The subject I/C group consume 2 ml ( 2.5 g ) honey/kg body weight/dose twice weekly first 12-week period ( period 1 ) , subject C/I group receive honey control period 1 . After period 1 , subject group exchange protocol follow 12-week period ( period 2 ) . To investigator knowledge , laboratory test measurement level honey blood tissue yet available . Therefore , ensure compliance honey intake , patient consume calculated dose honey visual supervision researcher . Each calculate dose honey dissolve water ingest patient . The honey use study Egyptian clover honey carbohydrate content 78.4 g/100 g , pH 3.7 moisture content 18.8 % . The physicochemical characteristic honey use study detail supplementary table 1 ( 17 ) . The primary outcome measure febrile neutropenia term frequency duration hospital stay . The secondary outcome measure hemoglobin ( Hb ) level , total leucocytic count ( TLC ) , absolute neutrophil count ( NE ) platelet count ( PLT ) . Blood count perform patient weekly basis . All measure analyze participant baseline ( 0 week ) , end 12th week ( crossover ) end 24th week ( end point ) . All patient develop FN study admit hospital receive empirical combination intravenous antibiotic therapy consist piperacillin ( 200mg/kg/24hr , divide q 6hr ) amikacin ( 20mg/kg q24hr ) . An informed consent obtain least one parent child enrollment , study approve local Ethics Committee Pediatric Department Ain Shams University Hospitals .</detailed_description>
