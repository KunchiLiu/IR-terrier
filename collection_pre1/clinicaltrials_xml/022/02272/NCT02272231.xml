	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) common cause vaginal discharge U.S . It associate adverse outcome include preterm birth , pelvic inflammatory disease , increase risk acquisition transmission sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , include HIV . Microbiologically , BV characterize depletion lactobacilli comprise normal vaginal flora increase facultative ( Gardnerella vaginalis ; GV ) strict anaerobe . Three four Amsel criterion necessary clinical diagnosis BV include ( 1 ) homogeneous , thin , grayish-white vaginal discharge , ( 2 ) vaginal pH &gt; 4.5 , ( 3 ) positive whiff-amine test , ( 4 ) clue cell present wet mount vaginal fluid . BV diagnosis , however , base rigorously Nugent score Gram stain vaginal secretion . Optimal vaginal flora , indicative predominance lactobacillus , represent Nugent score 0-3 . Abnormal vaginal flora include currently define BV ( Nugent score 7-10 ) also refer intermediate flora ( Nugent score 4-6 ) . For reason well understood , BV common among woman sex woman ( WSW ) , perhaps among heterosexual woman . Risks prevalent BV among WSW include high number lifetime female sexual partner , share use vaginally insert sex toy , oral-anal sex . In addition , WSW monogamous sexual partnership high concordance presence absence BV . These data support hypothesis BV sexually transmit . It well accept BV cause synergistic relationship large number microorganism include GV anaerobics ( i.e . BV-associated bacteria ; BVAB ) however trigger initiate alteration debate . It unknown whether BV result acquisition GV `` founder '' organism subsequently lead complex change vaginal microbiota associate BV whether BV transmit polymicrobial consortium . GV , facultative anaerobe , may well able tolerate high oxidation-reduction ( redox ) potential healthy vaginal microbiome , unlike strict anaerobe . Similar facultative anaerobe involve initiation oral disease , possible GV , metabolic pathway ability form biofilm ( perhaps influence specific oligotypes ) , create low redox potential vaginal microbiome . This alteration would cause marked decrease lactobacilli increase BVAB normally present low concentration , lead BV syndrome . Determining exact etiology agent ( ) cause shift optimal abnormal vaginal flora BV vital appropriate treatment prevention adverse outcome . With increase use molecular method , identification vaginal microorganism ( uncultivable ) specie level woman BV become feasible . This study seek investigate BV pathogenesis . We hypothesize sexual exposure Gardnerella vaginalis incite event lead complex change vaginal flora associate BV . If Gardnerella vaginalis initial insult , appearance establishment vaginal microbiome see woman develop incident BV prior increase BV-associated bacteria . Only African American woman enrol protocol difference composition vaginal microbial community woman without BV different racial ethnic group note could confound result study .</detailed_description>
