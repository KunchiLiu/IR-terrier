	<brief_summary>There evidence suggest OSA associate low level systemic inflammation oxidative stress . Low level systemic inflammation subsequent vascular damage implicate underlying mechanism responsible comorbidities . Detection alter inflammatory marker OSAS patient may predict degree nocturnal sleep disturbance associate systemic inflammation presence comorbidities . Recently , novel inflammatory biomarkers , neutrophil lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) propose indicator systemic inflammation . To knowledge , NLR study OSAS . We conduct present study evaluate association OSAS inflammatory marker CRP , ESR NLR .</brief_summary>
