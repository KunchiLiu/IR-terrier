Differences study condition grow large 4-month ( p &lt; .05 ) 6-month ( p &lt; .01 ) follow-up effect size 6 month medium large ( Cohen 's d=0.63 ) The study use mixed model quantitative qualitative method respond PA 's call study assess mechanisms change . Unlike many previous study SMI , employ limited exclusion criterion enroll participant present co-existing drug psychiatric disorder . Procedures propose study draw current successful RCT assess IMI methamphetamine ( MA ) dependence . Successful aspect current study include achievement recruitment goal , strong adherence treatment research protocol , excellent rate follow-up interview ( &gt; 90 % ) .

	<detailed_description>The propose study respond Program Announcement PA-10-100 , `` Alcohol Use Disorders : Treatment , Services Research , Recovery '' ( R01 ) issue National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) . Our application address priority announcement propose phase II randomize clinical trial compare intensive motivational interviewing ( IMI ) standard motivational interviewing technique ( SMI ) alcohol dependent woman . The study use mixed model quantitative qualitative method respond program announcement 's call study assess mechanisms change . Unlike many previous study SMI employ limit exclusion criterion enroll participant present co-existing drug psychiatric disorder . SMI initially develop brief intervention ( typically 1-3 session ) treatment problem drinker ( Miller &amp; Rollnick , 2002 ) . The general strategy SMI strategically combine supportive directive intervention way elicit ambivalence substance use ( i.e. , pro con ) thereby increase motivation change . Systematic review alcohol treatment literature consistently show SMI effective treating alcohol use disorder ( Hettema , Steele , &amp; Miller , 2005 ; Dunn , Deroo , Rivera , 2001 ) . Studies show SMI effective stand-alone treatment alcohol problem ( Project MATCH Research Group , 1997 ; Miller , 1993 ; Sellman , Sullivan , Dore , Adamson , &amp; MacEwan , 2001 ) preparation intensive treatment ( Burke , Arkowitz , &amp; Menchola , 2003 ) . Perhaps best-known large study SMI base assessment `` motivational enhancement therapy '' ( MET ) stand-alone , 4 session condition conduct Project MATCH Research Group ( Sellman , Sullivan , Dore , Adamson , &amp; MacEwan , 2001 ; Project MATCH Research Group , 1998 ) . Participants randomly assign 4 session MET , 12 session cognitive behavioral counseling ( CBT ) , 12 session 12-step facilitation ( TSF ) . Despite few session MET , outcomes among 3 condition comparable . A limitation study individual serious co-occurring drug mental health problem exclude housing instability . Like Project MATCH , study SMI alcohol problem exclude participant serious co-occurring drug mental health problem . However , precisely types individual treatment practitioner likely encounter publicly fund treatment program . When SMI intervention target illicit drug dependence result mixed . While number review ( Dunn , Deroo , Rivera , 2001 ) meta-analyses ( Burke , Arkowitz , &amp; Menchola , 2003 ; Hettema , Steele , &amp; Miller , 2005 ) conclude standard low-dose SMI effective preparation intensive drug treatment , study contradict finding ( Downey , Rosengren , &amp; Donovan , 2001 ; Miller , Yahne , Tonigan , 2003 ; Winhusen et al. , 2008 ; Mullins , Suerez , Ondersman , Page , 2004 ; Schneider , Casey , Kohn , 2000 ) . When effect find drug co-occurring disorder commonly retention , substance use ( Carroll et al. , 2006 ) . Procedures propose study draw current successful RCT assess IMI MA dependence . Successful aspect current study include achievement recruitment goal , strong adherence treatment research protocol , excellent rate follow-up interview ( &gt; 90 % ) . The propose study take place outpatient treatment program current study , New Leaf Treatment Center Lafayette , California . Two hundred twenty alcohol dependent woman randomly assign IMI SMI attention component time equivalence ( nutrition education ) . Participants group receive standard group treatment offer program . The primary outcome measure drink , heavy drinking ( 4+ drink ) , severity alcohol problem assess baseline 2 , 6 , 12 month . Secondary outcome include Addiction Severity Index scale , psychiatric problem , symptom trauma . The study include standard quantitative test potential mediator , include , therapeutic alliance , self-efficacy , motivation , satisfaction , use outside service . However , application also propose innovative use qualitative procedure identify unrecognized factor influence outcome . Aim 1 : To compare drink alcohol problem among woman receive IMI SMI . Hypothesis 1.1 : During active phase treatment ( week 1-9 ) woman IMI few positive breathalyzer screen , drink day , heavy drinking day ( 4+ drink ) woman SMI . Hypothesis 1.2 : Women IMI demonstrate fewer drinking day heavy drinking day ( 4+ drink ) low score Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) Alcohol Scale 2 , 6 , 12 month . Aim 2 : To assess potential mediator drink alcohol problem . Hypothesis 2.1 : Measures retention , therapeutic alliance , social support , motivation mediate relationship study condition drink outcome . Aim 3 : To Use qualitative interview identify additional factor influence outcome . Content area include perception therapist , IMI &amp; SMI intervention , CBT group , external influence Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) , intimate partner , friend , family .
