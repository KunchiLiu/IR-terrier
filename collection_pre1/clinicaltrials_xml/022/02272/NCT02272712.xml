Further inquiry clearly warrant consistent insight Canadian cancer patient suggest use technology factor would facilitate participation insomnia treatment program .

Adult outpatient diagnose type cancer ( stag I-III ) , complete active treatment least 1 month ( exception hormone therapy ) without cancer recurrence recruit The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre Cancercare Manitoba ( n = 150 ) . All meet establish diagnostic research criterion chronic insomnia . Prior acceptance study , procedure fully explain , inclusion/exclusion criterion assess , formal consent obtain . Once accept study , participant randomize ( stratified hormone therapy-yes ) one two study arm . Online assessment measure ( insomnia severity , pre-sleep arousal , beliefs sleep , fatigue , mood , anxiety , quality life ) complete baseline period , week 6 ( post treatment ) , 3 month follow-up ; however , online diary assessment sleep parameter potential side-effects ( fatigue , affect , cognition , pain , drug dosing ) enter daily potential side-effects also assess online weekly course treatment . Analyses involve mixed model latent growth curve model . The computerized intervention evaluate study potential bridge exist gap knowledge translation provide cancer survivor widespread access CBT-I cost-effective manner .
