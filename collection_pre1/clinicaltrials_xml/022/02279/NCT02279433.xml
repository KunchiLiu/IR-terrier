	<brief_summary>DS-6051b orally administer inhibitor tyrosine kinase ROS1 NTRKs . This phase 1 first-in-human study evaluate safety tolerability DS-6051b cancer subject identify recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . In addition , study also assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile preliminary efficacy DS-6051b .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-in-human Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics DS-6051b</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Dose Escalation part ( Part 1 ) study evaluate safety tolerability , determine tentative RP2D . Plasma exposure DS-6051a exposure - QT interval prolongation relationship also assess . Approximately 30 subject advance solid tumor harbor ROS1 NTRK1 , NTRK2 , NTRK3 rearrangement , neuroendocrine carcinoma , advance solid tumor tumor-induced pain enrol . After safety profile DS-6051b adequately evaluate , Dose Expansion part ( Part 2 ) initiate assess safety tolerability , preliminarily evaluate efficacy DS-6051b tentative RP2D . Approximately 40 cancer subject carry ROS1 NTRK1 , NTRK2 , NTRK3 rearrangement enrol .</detailed_description>
