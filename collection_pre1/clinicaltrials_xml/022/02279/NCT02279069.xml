	<detailed_description>Stroke patient frequently need walk aid 4-point canne . However , 4-point canne lift patient limited gait speed . The adjunction small wheel 4 point canne ( 4-roll ) give possibility patient walk without lift canne roll ground . OBJECTIVE To compare gait parameter 4-point canne 4-roll canne METHODS The investigator recruit stroke patient necessitate 4 point-canne walking aid . A 10 meter walk test , 6 minute walk test , estimate energy cost patient 's satisfaction monitor 4-point canne ( day 1 ) 4-roll canne ( day 2 ) cross-over study . The first tested device randomize . PERSPECTIVE The investigator hope demonstrate 4-roll canne make possible walk faster safe way stroke</detailed_description>
