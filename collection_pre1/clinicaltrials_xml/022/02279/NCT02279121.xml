	<brief_title>ATAPAC Study ( TauroLock Activity Adult Cancer Patients )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central venous catheter ( CVC ) -associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) represent serious persistent health problem cancer patient implantable CVC receive intravenous ( IV ) anti-tumor therapy . The CLABSI include CVC-associated bacteremia negative bloodstream local generalize infection . CLABSI significantly increase morbidity hospital cost . They lead also discontinuation IV anti-tumor treatment , severe sepsis , septic shock death . Microbial colonization biofilm development , resistant antibiotic therapy , often lead CVC replacement . CLABSI prevention key measure improve clinical outcome , particularly patient high risk . For reason , CLABSI prevention national priority healthcare program . Taurolidine [ bis- ( 1,1-dioxoperhydro-1,2,4-thiadiazinyl-4 ) methane ] antimicrobial agent kill inhibits wide range micro-organisms vitro , include multidrug resistant bacteria . A catheter lock solution develop contain 1.35 % taurolidine 4 % citrate . Due anti-adhesion activity taurolidine anti-thrombotic property citrate , lock solution disrupt bacterial adhesion inner surface implantable CVC prevent production biofilm . This lock solution show substantial reduction formation biofilm bacterial colonization inner surface implantable CVC several prospective trial . In study pediatric cancer receive IV anti-tumor treatment , use lock solution taurolidine-citrate result reduction Gram-positive CLABSI compare control group patient treat standard heparin lock solution . In another study 71 pediatric patient , taurolidine-citrate solution reduce CLABSI compare heparin ( 0.3 vs 1.3 infection per 1000 catheter-days , p : 0.03 ) . Microbial colonization find 25.4 % catheter . Regarding toxicity , 7 patient taurolidine-citrate group ( 20 % ) experience side effect , nausea , vomit abnormal sensation taste . Some clinical trial also demonstrate efficacy taurolidine-citrate term CLABSI reduction patient home total parenteral nutrition hemodialysis patient . According French guideline , anti-bacterial lock therapy ( preferably taurolidine ) may use prevention patient increase risk serious CLABSI complication . However , effectiveness lock taurolidine-citrate solution adult patient solid tumor receive anti-tumor treatment via totally implantable CVC actually unknown remains assess . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - To compare efficacy lock taurolidine-citrate solution v standard saline solution primary prevention CLABSI adult patient treat IV anti-tumor therapy solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - To compare impact CLABSI 2 group term day hospitalisation , delay IV anti-tumoral treatment , cost CVC removal CLABSI-management - To evaluate adverse effect lock taurolidine-citrate solution adult patient receive IV anti-tumor therapy solid tumor PRIMARY ENDPOINT : Incidence rate CLABSI per 1000 catheter-days SECONDARY ENDPOINTS - Days CLABSI-related hospitalisation - Anti-tumor treatment CLABSI-related delay - Total CVC-removal CLABSI - Costs associate CLABSI management perspective health insurance - Evaluation taurolidine-citrate solution-related adverse effect METHODOLOGY - Single-center prospective , randomize , open-label , control , clinical phase IV trial - 1:1 randomization Stratification : - Metastatic v ( neo ) adjuvant - Age ≤ 70 year vs &gt; 70 year PROCEDURES During standard clinical visit IV anti-tumor treatment administration , investigator informs patient study procedure check eligibility criterion . At begin next cure , collect inform consent performs randomisation . The patient include TauroLock ™ saline arm . At begin course , nurse remove lock TauroLock ™ / make rinse CVC . At end course , rinse CVC instills TauroLock ™ solution patient TauroLock ™ arm . Patients follow treatment , accord rhythm anti-tumor treatment program end study : end IV anti-tumor treatment , CVC removal mechanical reason CLABSI . A follow-up visit perform 7-30 day study end . PATIENTS NUMBER Based surveillance data nosocomial infection institution , incidence CLABSI control group expect 3 per 1000 catheter-days . Assuming use TauroLock ™ reduce least rate three ( expect 1 per 1000 treat group rate ) , consistent literature data , 9785 day must follow group ( α β risk 5 % 10 % , respectively ) . Considering mean follow-up 4 month , need 81 patient pour treatment group , 162 patient 2 group . TRIAL TIME Duration inclusion period : - 6 month Duration participation patient : - Duration IV anti-tumor treatment + 1 month follow-up STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Verification homogeneity group major confound factor : WHO performance status , indication anti-tumor treatment ( metastatic v ( neo ) -adjuvant cancer ) , age , duration follow-up , type anti-tumor treatment ( weekly , every 15 21 day ) type hospitalisation ( full v day-hospital ) . Qualitative variable compare 2 group Chi-square test Fisher exact test normality condition meet . Quantitative variable compare Student 's test non parametric Wilcoxon test normality condition meet . Primary endpoint : incidence CLABSI compare group logistic regression test adjustment stratification confound factor , necessary . Secondary endpoint : qualitative criterion compare 2 group Chi-square test Fisher exact test condition normality meet . The quantitative criterion compare Student 's test non parametric Wilcoxon test condition normality meet . The α risk set 5 % . EXPECTED BENEFITS The expected benefit direct reduction CLABSI adult cancer patient receive IV anti-tumor treatment via CVC lead direct reduction morbidity mortality . In addition , good control CLABSI allow cost saving . A literature review Centers Disease Control Prevention ( Atlanta , USA ) estimate $ 29,156 7288 cost CLABSI . Similarly , report Institute Research Documentation Health Economics ( IRDES ) , base PMSI ( Program medicalization information system ) data , estimate CLABSI entail additional cost € 10,950 ( + / - 1690 ) extend hospitalisation 14.7 day ( + / - 1.84 ) . Finally , reduction CLABSI globally lead less use antibiotic consequently reduce probability resistant organisms selection . QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN Data record paper case report form medical record . The accuracy completeness data monitor study coordinator : - 100 % inform consent , eligibility criterion safety data - 20 % data record CRF ( case report form ) Data register Microsoft Office ACCESS 2003 Base . It 's single-center study thre 're special procedure address registry operation analysis activity . Safety data like report adverse event make fax The CRPV ( centre régional de pharmacovogilance de Nancy ) . The security data transfer assure french `` Méthodologie de Référence MR001 '' ( Comission Nationale Informatique et Liberté ) .</detailed_description>
