	<detailed_description>The global neonatal mortality burden one imminent factor derail achievement MDG 4 many develop country include Pakistan . Four million infant infant die first 28 day live account 40 % total under-five mortality . The burden neonatal mortality Pakistan alarm current neonatal mortality rate ( NMR ) 55 per 1000 live birth , third bad world . The major cause deaths infection , preterm birth birth asphyxia avoidable . Despite many initiative NMR remain unchanged since last decade Pakistan . Literature show low cost facility community base intervention reduce NMR significantly . Early neonatal care , application chlorhexidine cord care Kangaroo Mother Care ( KMC ) recognize effective intervention reduction neonatal morbidity subsequently neonatal mortality many develop country . However intervention never test package data combine effect scarce Pakistan develop country . Considering importance issue well recognize intervention propose randomize controlled trial rural district Pakistan evaluate effectiveness neonatal package comprise standard neonatal care , KMC application chlorhexidine compare standard neonatal care couple application chlorhexidine standard neonatal care alone . We anticipate study provide evidence base way forward benefit child Pakistan .</detailed_description>
