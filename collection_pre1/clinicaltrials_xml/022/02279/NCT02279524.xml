	<detailed_description>This multicenter , Phase IIb , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study design evaluate efficacy safety two Aramchol dos subject 18 75 year age , Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) confirm liver biopsy perform period 6 month enter study , overweight obesity pre diabetic type II diabetic . Eligible subject enrol three treatment arm : Aramchol 400 600 mg tablet placebo tablet ratio 2:2:1 . The subject evaluate study site 11 schedule visit : screening ( visit 1 ( week -4 - 0 ) ) , baseline ( visit 2 ( day 0 ) ) , visit 3 ( week 2 ) , visit 4 week 4 ) , visit 5 ( week 8 ) , visit 6 ( week 12 ) , visit 7 ( week 24 ) , visit 8 ( week 32 ) , visit 9 ( week 40 ) visit 10 ( week 52 - ( End Treatment/early termination visit ) ) . After completion study treatment period , subject followed additional period 13 week without study medication ( visit 11 ( week 65 ) ) . During screen period , severity disease evaluate blood test , liver biopsy NMRS . During study follow assessment perform : - Vital sign measure study visit . - A physical examination perform screening visit , 24 week , End Treatment/early termination week 65 visit . The following blood test perform : complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum chemistry ( include electrolyte , liver enzymes , direct total bilirubin , glucose , lipid profile include triglyceride , cholesterol , HDL , LDL VLDL , CPK , creatinine , urea , albumin , alkaline phosphatase ) , ESR urinalysis screen visit , baseline , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , 40 , 52 65 ( end follow ) visit . Serology ( HBV , HCV HIV ) perform screen visit . Coagulation ( fibrinogen , PT/INR , aPTT ) measure screen baseline , week 24 , End Treatment/early termination week 65 visit . Insulin ( HOMA ) measure screening , week 24 End Treatment/early termination visit . HbA1C measure screening , week 8 , 24 , 40 End Treatment/early termination visit . C reactive protein , Leptin , Adiponectin , CK-18 ( M30 M65 ) , Ferritin , PAI-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , FGF-19 , C4 ( 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one ) , pool serum Bile Acids , B-hydroxybutyrate Free Fatty Acids measure baseline visit end treatment period . The blood sample take visit , test possible biomarkers , include , limited , Fetuine A GDF15 . TSH , T3 T4 measure screen visit . beta-hCG woman childbearing potential perform screening visit . A serum sample collect keep frozen study end case special investigation need perform . This sample collect screen visit 10/Early Termination . - Body weight waist circumference measure screening , baseline , week 24 , end treatment week 65 visit . Height measure screen visit . - ECG perform screen visit , visit 7 ( week 24 ) end treatment visit . - All subject undergo two NMRS scan , screen end treatment visit . - FibroMax test perform investigator think necessary - Liver biopsy conduct screening end treatment visit . The biopsy screen visit perform do within 6 month prior visit . - Metabolomics blood test perform screening , visit 7 End-of-Treatment/Early Termination visit . From consent patient ( 15 ) sample liver biopsy take analysis . - Endothelial Function conduct select site . The test conduct baseline visit study treatment give End Treatment/early termination visit . - Blood sample Aramchol trough level collect ( pre-dose ) patient Israel baseline ( visit 2 ) week 4 ( visit 4 ) , week 12 ( visit 6 ) , week 24 ( visit 7 ) , week 40 ( visit 9 ) , end treatment ( visit 10 ) follow ( visit 11 ) . At select site Mexico , USA Hong Kong one blood sample collect ( pre-dose ) visit 4 ( 10 subject per country ) test trough Aramchol blood level difference population ( e.g. , African American , Asian , Hispanic ) . - Blood sample gene analysis take consent patient baseline visit , keep frozen analyze study end . - Life style questionnaire complete visit . - Adverse event monitor throughout study . - Concomitant Medications monitor throughout study . - Telephone contact perform week 16 , 20 , 28 , 36 , 44 48 . An interim safety analysis conduct soon 120 subject complete follow period 24 week study treatment . An independent DSMB analyze safety data recommend continued course action . All patient continue treat study protocol conclusion analysis know . Safety assessment include frequency severity treatment-emergent AEs , clinically significant laboratory abnormality , ECG change physical examination finding .</detailed_description>
