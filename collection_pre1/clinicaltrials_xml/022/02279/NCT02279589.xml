	<detailed_description>Immune response analysis combination PCV13 PPV23 lead evaluate prime PCV13 help obtain good response repeat dose PPV23.The hyporesponsiveness follow unconjugated vaccine associate high polysaccharide antigen concentration . Several issue limit development recommendation anti-pneumococcal vaccine adult 's patient risk . Reduced dos unconjugated polysaccharide antigen would bypass hyporesponsiveness maintain expand coverage serotype . A good knowledge immune response follow combination two vaccine adult essential . In addition , adult require exposed repeated dos polysaccharide antigen vaccine natural exposure , important determine extend duration hyporesponsiveness . The main objective evaluate non conjugate polysaccharidique fractionate dos administer conjugate vaccine help avoid hyporesponse schedule repeat injection pneumococcal polysaccharidique vaccine The project aim : - Primary evaluate non conjugate polysaccharidique fractionate dos administer conjugate vaccine help avoid hyporesponse schedule repeat injection pneumococcal polysaccharidique vaccine . Secondary objective : - To study immune response involve combine conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) non-conjugate polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 full dose fractionate booster dose ) assess eventual prime-boost effect . - To study impact fraction PPV23 immune response PPV23 serotypes , measure extension serotype coverage . - To assess sustainability evolution immune response time - To investigate clinical tolerance initial dose PCV13 follow repeat dos PPV23 vaccine - To describe invasive infection pneumococcal community acquire pneumonia occur time course study . Study duration Recruitment : 6 month Participation : 36 month Total duration study : 42 month Study Design Vaccine trial Open randomize 1:1:1:1 phase II compare immunogenicity four pneumococcal vaccination strategy administer intramuscular route healthy volunteer 's adult age 18 49 year . Four dose combination two vaccine assess , Pneumo23® Prevenar13® . Volunteers receive three vaccine injection study . Sixty ( 60 ) healthy volunteer enrol randomize four follow group : - Group A : 15 subject receive M0 one dose Prevenar13® , M2 one dose Pneumo23® M12 , 1/5 dose Pneumo23® - Group B : 15 subject receive M0 one dose Prevenar13® , M2 1/5 dose Pneumo23® M12 , 1/5 dose Pneumo23® - Group C : 15 subject receive M0 one dose Prevenar13® , M2 1/5 dose Pneumo23® M12 , one dose Pneumo23® - Group D : 15 subject receive M0 one dose Prevenar13® , M2 one dose Pneumo23® M12 , one dose Pneumo23® Number visit per volunteer : 9 visit - 3 vaccination visit : M0 , M2 , M12 - 6 follow-up visit : M1 , M3 , M13 , M18 , M24 , M36 . - Unscheduled visit suspect invasive pneumococcal infection ( meningitis , bacteraemia , pneumonia , pleural-pneumonia ) Total number schedule subject : 60 healthy volunteer recruit CIC 1417 : 15 volunteer per group There statistical determination sample size . Data trial identify one vaccine strategy could test clinical trial population risk invasive pneumococcal disease . Data publish study n't give homogeneous reference geometric mean titer OPA fractional polysaccharidique vaccine . This first study evaluate combine vaccination strategy schedule one initial dose PCV13 complete fractional dos PPV23 . Expected patient public health benefit A well assessment immunogenicity induce combination Prevenar13® Pneumo23® allow adapt pneumococcal vaccine recommendation adult . The Pneumo23® long time vaccine recommend adult condition place high risk invasive pneumococcal infection : splenectomy functional asplenia , homozygous sickle cell disease , HIV infection ( regardless immunovirological status ) , nephrotic syndrome , respiratory failure , heart failure , patient chronic liver disease , history pulmonary infection invasive pneumococcal disease . It repeat every 5 year ( BEH-vaccination schedule vaccine recommendation ) , give absence immune memory . But immunogenicity limit repeated dos may induce hyporesponsiveness . The recent availability Prevenar13® , polysaccharide conjugate vaccine , adult lead reassess recommendation adult advise combination two vaccine : PCV13 PPV23 2 month apart ( repeat dos PPV23 5 year ) , induce response call `` prime-boost '' , say PPV23stimulation memory response initiate PCV13 ( Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) Recommended Immunization Schedule Adults Aged 19 Years Older - United States , 2013 -- MMWR/January 28 2013/Vol . 62 ) . These recommendation need rely solid immunological substrate , include data adult whose immune status differs child . To knowledge , data examine various mechanism immune response combination two vaccine , take account effect dose polysaccharide antigen study , immunological monitoring adult . Data clinical trial therefore support recommendation , either induction immunological memory response PCV13 , impact repeat dos PPV23 . Preventing pneumococcal infection would decrease morbidity ; extend life expectancy quality life patient risk . In public health perspective , reduce number duration hospitalization , would reduce dramatically vaccine cost .
