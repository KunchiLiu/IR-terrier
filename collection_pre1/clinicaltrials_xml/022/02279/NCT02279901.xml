	<detailed_description>Background Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent condition base polysomnographic criterion affect 24 % men 9 % woman middle-aged population . Due high prevalence , association cardiovascular disease , impact neurocognitive function daytime vigilance , carry high healthcare burden give population . A recent assessment estimate yearly economic cost OSA Australia ( population around 23 million ) $ 21 billion . Thus , important u consider effective treatment individual , cost effective management population . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy remain gold standard treatment give ability provide near-complete physiologic effectiveness regardless OSA phenotype . This therapy improve daytime vigilance currently therapy substantial evidence suggest improvement cardiovascular risk . The primary well-known challenge CPAP incomplete adherence patient therapy ( long-term CPAP compliance define percentage day least 4 hour usage typically report around 50 % . ) Advances CPAP technology ( autoCPAP ) show enhance use . Rather successfully improve CPAP use likely emphasize patient education regard risk associate OSA , potential benefit therapy , teach technique acclimate CPAP , provide system accountability follow-up process . The impact provide system accountability education/troubleshooting reflect study show improved CPAP adherence usage track daily ( remote wireless process ) follow telephone encounter problem CPAP use reveal . Compared control group ( usual clinical follow-up ) , average CPAP use per night higher ( 321 minute versus 207 minute ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) 3 month initiation therapy . The challenge replicate telemedicine workflow real-world set labor-intensive nature track patient daily basis logistics dispense retrieve wireless modem . Furthermore , patient education time-consuming , ability provide comprehensive education without built-in efficiency could potentially affect financial health provider . With change landscape healthcare reimbursement emphasize achieve positive clinical outcome , discover automate self-directed method educate follow-up need . Web-Based Education Emmi Solutions produce Web-based , simple understand , healthcare relate educational program . These program interactive session last 15 minute , educate patient risk certain medical condition assist prepare patient procedure . Emmi also produce OSA related program : 1 . OSA program - program educate patient symptom OSA , provide animated video depict airway narrow OSA event , discuss health related risk OSA cardiovascular disease impact daytime vigilance , preliminarily discuss CPAP potential therapy , discuss test process ambulatory in-lab polysomnography 2 . CPAP program - program educate patient properly use CPAP wear mask , discuss potential benefit CPAP use include impact health risk daytime vigilance , provide method acclimate CPAP , encourage patient give dedicate trial CPAP even initially trouble , instruct care device need replace equipment . Links program email patient date birth need verified program start . The program ask patient feedback regular interval provide opportunity throughout make note write question later print . These program already approve clinical use within Kaiser Permanente contract vendor . Interactive Voice Response Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) protocol automate message deliver patient provide feedback regard CPAP use , intend improve therapy adherence . While IVR refers voice call via telephone , use term also include message deliver text message email . The basic protocol involve use CPAP device wirelessly send usage data cloud platform . Automated algorithms ass usage data send message patient suboptimal usage excessive leak , provide encouragement successful use ( See Figure 1 program threshold trigger message ) . Specifically , investigator use CPAP device built-in modem ( AirSense 10 ; ResMed Corporation ) send usage data via cellular network ( Verizon Sprint depend signal availability ) cloud base platform ( AirView ; ResMed Corporation ) . This data transfer second cloud-based platform ( U-Sleep ; Umbian ) , second platform automatically analyze usage data send automate message back patient . With message , reminder contact sleep center question problem regard CPAP usage . Patients also ability login U-Sleep platform time track therapy information . Study Proposal The investigator plan investigate impact adjunct Web education automate follow-up CPAP use measurement patient engagement . The Kaiser Permanente Fontana Sleep Disorders Center ( Fontana , California ) integrate sleep center function closed-loop system balance diagnostic test wide array different follow-up program . The primary diagnostic pathway within center suspect OSA home sleep test begin classroom education include setup home sleep test device . Subsequent clinical visit individual appointment , patient undergo 1 week autoCPAP trial OSA present . If appropriate , patient subsequently order CPAP long-term use , 3 month follow-up visit schedule . Our study enroll patient one four pathway : 1 ) One-fourth patient follow usual workflow function primary control group ( Traditional Pathway ) ; 2 ) One-fourth follow usual workflow addition Emmi OSA education prior initial OSA class Emmi CPAP education undergo autoCPAP trial ( Telemedicine Education Pathway ) ; 3 ) One-fourth follow usual workflow addition IVR follow-up ( Telemedicine IVR Pathway ) ; 4 ) One fourth follow usual workflow addition Emmi program IVR follow-up ( Telemedicine Both Pathway ) The specific aim pilot study follow : 1 . Assess impact Telemedicine mechanism CPAP use 3 month initiate therapy comparison Traditional pathway patient . 2 . Assess impact Telemedicine mechanism functional outcome parameter healthcare utilization 3 month initiation therapy comparison Traditional pathway patient . Methods Study Design This performance improvement initiative structure randomize control trial design assess impact automate educational follow-up mechanism measure patient engagement patient OSA . Consecutive patient triaged home sleep test suspected OSA schedule attend OSA class ( investigator schedule 5 class 13 patient per week ) . Classes variably assign follow one 4 Pathways ( 1 Traditional 3 Telemedicine ) thus result pseudo-randomization effect ( class rather individual patient randomize ) - See Figure 2 . The investigator plan analyze outcomes four pathway 1000 consecutive patient ( anticipated 250 pathway ) attend OSA class complete 3 month CPAP follow-up . Traditional Pathway Patients attend 1 hour OSA Class ( class size 13 ) OSA education provide home sleep testing ( Nox T3 , Carefusion ) set . These patient return next day individual appointment study score test result discuss patient . If study consistent OSA base Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI4 % ) least 5/hour , patient undergo 1 week autoCPAP trial . During week , wireless remote monitoring ( AirView ; ResMed ) perform troubleshoot provide via telephone encounter problem CPAP use identify . The autoCPAP return individual visit , CPAP order long-term use base trial result patient feedback . Patients schedule 3 month follow-up appointment also instruct call sleep center case manager ( visit walk-in clinic ) prior visit problem CPAP use . Telemedicine Education Pathway Patients follow usual workflow outline Traditional Pathway . In addition , patient email link view Emmi OSA program within 2 week prior initial OSA class . If patient test positive OSA agree autoCPAP trial , patient email link view Emmi CPAP program . These patient also schedule 3 month follow-up visit check CPAP usage . Telemedicine IVR Pathway Patients follow usual workflow outline Traditional Pathway . Additionally , CPAP order long-term therapy , patient enrol IVR protocol ( U-Sleep ) automatically analyze patient 's CPAP use . If specific provider-defined threshold meet ( Figure 1 ) , platform automatically deliver feedback message patient ( via patient 's choice phone call , text messaging , email ) intention encourage good CPAP use . Patients instructed contact sleep center issue therapy . This platform also include method patient track usage online . Automated message mechanism active 3 month CPAP order , message stop . These patient also schedule 3 month follow-up visit . Telemedicine Both Pathway Patients follow usual workflow outline Traditional Pathway . In addition , patient provide Emmi education program IVR follow-up previously outline . These patient also schedule 3 month follow-up . Measured Variables Age , gender , body mass index , polysomnography respiratory parameter , ESS ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) , Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire - 10 Questions ( FOSQ-10 ) assess baseline . CPAP use , Epworth sleepiness Scale , FOSQ-10 assess 3 month follow-up . These measured variable already part standard clinical assessment . The investigator also evaluate measure patient engagement cost-effectiveness care collect information regard adherence number provider encounter .</detailed_description>
