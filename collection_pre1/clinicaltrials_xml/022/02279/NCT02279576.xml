	<brief_summary>Penile cancer uncommon disease , devastate physical psychological effect patient . Penile carcinoma even advanced stage responsive several chemotherapeutic agent . However , due low incidence penile cancer , large study report concern chemotherapy . Various single agent test activity en penile cancer de 70 80 . Response rate range 10 27 % cisplatin , 20 21 % bleomycin , 0-62 % methotrexate . These agent combination test different study . Other chemotherapy scheme study , combination cisplatin 5 fluorouracil without taxol , cisplatin plus irinotecan . All limited phase II study , describe high response rate without result confirmation phase III study . In conclusion , test regimens far successful advanced stage disease . Antiangiogenic therapy demonstrate effective treatment similar cancer type lung head neck , postulate antiangiogenic therapy effective treatment penile carcinoma . Pazopanib new potent oral antiangiogenic therapy . Cytotoxic agent , paclitaxel , administer low dos frequent interval , may exert antiangiogenic effect , thereby enhance anticancer activity . Recently , combination pazopanib paclitaxel administer metronomic schedule ( 80mg/m2 weekly 3 week every 4 week cycle ) obtain 40 % response rate 80 % disease control first-line treatment melanoma patient . Treatment well tolerated . As paclitaxel antiangiogenic drug seem active treatment , combination pazopanib paclitaxel seem good combination test patient penile carcinoma .</brief_summary>
