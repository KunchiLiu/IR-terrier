	<detailed_description>Development validate computer-based instrument ( software program ) assessment intermediate visual acuity ( IVA ) . It known validated method evaluation IVA exist . Primary objective study validate specific computer-based chart ( optotype ) enable : ) comparative study among different group presbyopic patient refractive error ( ie . myopia , hyperopia , and/or astigmatism ) , , b ) assessment efficacy surgical refractive procedure ( ie . LASIK ) presbyopic patient . Intermediate Visual acuity chart similar prevalent Jaeger chart . It consist short block text various type sizes.The computer screen set specific read distance ( 1 meter ) patient ask read passage small type he/she see . According small text he/she read , IVA classify IVA1 ( consider equivalent 20/20 distance visual acuity ) IVA5 Validation computer-based IVA chart do correlate result IVA chart correspond one validate 20/20 distant Jaeger near visual acuity chart , random sample study participant different refractive error different near distant visual acuity .</detailed_description>
