	<brief_summary>Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva ( FOP ) rare , severely disable disease characterize painful , recurrent episode soft tissue swell ( flare-up ) result abnormal bone formation ( heterotopic ossification HO ) muscle , tendon , ligament . Flare-ups begin early life may occur spontaneously soft tissue trauma , vaccination , influenza infection . Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement lock joint lead cumulative loss function disability . Mouse model FOP demonstrate ability retinoic acid receptor gamma ( RARÎ³ ) agonists palovarotene prevent HO follow injury . This 24-month study ( 1 ) continue follow 40 FOP subject complete Clementia Study PVO-1A-201 ; ( 2 ) enroll 20 additional new subject achieve least 90 % skeletal maturity ; ( 3 ) evaluate ability different palovarotene dose regimen prevent HO subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Extension Study Palovarotene Treat Preosseous Flare-ups FOP Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective Phase 2 , multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety efficacy different palovarotene dose regimen subject FOP . In Part A , subject complete Study PVO-1A-201 enrol current study receive daily treatment open-label palovarotene dose 10 mg 14 day , follow 5 mg 28 day ( weight-based equivalent ) . This part study complete . In Part B , Adult Cohort subject ( least 90 % skeletal maturity ) treat 5 mg palovarotene daily 24 month . Site visit occur baseline/screening Study Months 12 24 ; subject also contact telephone every 3 month . In event eligible flare-up , Adult Cohort subject receive 20 mg palovarotene daily 28 day , follow 10 mg 56 day . Dosing may extend flare-up resolved Flare-up Day 84 continue flare-up resolve ( end-of-treatment [ EOT ] ) . Dose reduction , direct Investigator , may occur event intolerable side effect . The flare-up base dose regimen Pediatric Cohort subject ( less 90 % skeletal maturity ) Adult Cohort subject except dos adjust weight . Pediatric subject receive non-flare-up daily dose preliminary efficacy safety data obtain Adult Cohort . Site visit occur Flare-up Baseline Flare-up Day 84/EOT ; subject also contact telephone every 2 week .</detailed_description>
