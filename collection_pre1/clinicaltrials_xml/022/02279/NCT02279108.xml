	<brief_summary>The sentinel node fundamental role management early breast cancer . Currently , double detection blue radioisotope recommend . A radioactive material require presence nuclear medicine department approval health authority . In many center , technique available . The use blue easier implement technique . However , allergic reaction prolong breast tattoo lead many team stop practice . So common practice , many center use single method . However , single detection , risk false negative identification failure rate increase significant extent number sentinel lymph node detect remove enough . Under condition , find another method detection seem crucial . According literature , fluorescence method ( ICG ) technique seem safe reliable . The investigator therefore propose prospective , randomize study investigate interest fluorescence associate isotopic method .</brief_summary>
