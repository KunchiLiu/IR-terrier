	<brief_summary>The purpose study find gross motor skill child young adult bleed disorder different without bleed disorder . The investigator use standardized motor test Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency , Second Edition ( BOT-2 tm ) . The second purpose establish history joint disease secondary bleeding affect gross motor skill . 1 . Participants set : Subjects include 100 male youth young adult , age 4 21 , recruit patient population Hemophilia Treatment Center OHSU . A mail describes study may send potential subject receive care Hemophilia Treatment Center OHSU . Data collection occur either clinic visit home . Information , include history change joint structure synovium , exist bleed disorder repository OHSU also use . 2 . Design Procedures : Research do use prospective , cross-sectional study design examine relationship diagnosis bleed disorder gross motor development . The gross motor ability child young adult bleed disorder meet inclusion criterion compare sex-specific normative data standardize motor test . Information age , type hemophilia , presence inhibitor , type management use , body composition , range motion , hand strength also collect direct measurement chart review . The information collect entered repository . A subject may choose opt repository still participate research study . In addition , information current hemophilia repository compare gross motor ability score determine joint disease relate skill level group people . 3 . Proposed analysis : Two-tailed test logistic regression use determine significant difference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine whether gross motor proficiency child young adult hemophilia falls average , sex-specific normative data , use standardized motor assessment Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency , Second Edition ( BOT-2™ ) . The primary hypothesis child young adult hemophilia perform low level gross motor proficiency compare same-aged peer , despite advance care . The secondary purpose establish whether relationship joint health level gross motor proficiency . The secondary hypothesis history hemophilia-caused ankle , knee , elbow arthropathy result significant difference gross motor proficiency within population child young adult hemophilia . Background/justification/rationale With advent widely-used prophylactic treatment people bleed disorder , activity-limiting joint disease may significantly reduce . Research investigate joint health aerobic capacity boys hemophilia , X-linked bleeding disorder , show significantly different level functional ability compare peer , though parameter may continue low . However , recent unpublished report preliminary data use Bruinicks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency ( BOT-2 tm ) , standardize gross motor assessment tool , suggest male child young adult bleed disorder function significantly low level gross motor skill compare normative , sex-specific data , establish standardize BOT-2 . This question important determination prognosis intervention population . Study Design Research conduct utilizing prospective , cross-sectional study design analyze relationship diagnosis bleed disorder gross motor development male child young adult well association joint health gross motor development . As diagnosis hemophilia extremely rare woman statistical analysis require use sex-specific normative data , research study focus strictly population boy young men diagnosis hemophilia . Once informed consent assent ( applicable ) obtain , data collect OHSU research personnel regular clinic visit Hemophilia Treatment Center ( HTC ) . If subject unable visit clinic , inform consent/assent study visit may perform subject 's home . Recruitment Methods Potential subject recruit clinic visit Hemophilia Treatment Center OHSU . An IRB-approved recruitment letter may also mail Hemophilia Treatment Center 's mail list recruit potential subject . Consent Process Informed , face-to-face consent seek prior collection data . Following detailed explanation component study , parent legal guardian subject , subject 17 , subject may sign informed consent . Assent obtain patient age 7-17 . All child eligible participation study age 17 assess understanding prior signing assent form . Should subject parent non-English speaking , in-person interpreter present entire consenting process ensure understanding . Study Procedures Data collection take place one clinic visit one home visit OHSU personnel . An interpreter schedule family require interpreter home visit clinic visit . If data collection complete one visit , return visit , either clinic home , conduct . Clinical Data Current clinical data collect subject 's medical record . Clinical data include body composition record Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , type bleeding disorder , severity , presence inhibitor , method management , age . If current height weight available chart data collection occur subject 's home , appropriate device measurement height weight supply investigator visit . This data transcribe onto data collection sheet subject . Collected data deposit data collection spreadsheet . In addition , exist hemophilia repository IRB # e5102 &amp; IRB # e7074 access subject study collect follow data : clinical joint health , document use Hemophilia Joint Health Score ( HJHS ) , presence chronic synovitis . Collected data deposit data collection spreadsheet . Range Motion During subject 's clinic home visit , assessment range motion hip flexion extension , knee flexion extension , ankle dorsiflexion plantarflexion , elbow flexion extension , forearm pronation supination , shoulder flexion take use goniometer musculoskeletal landmark accord standard clinical practice Hemophilia Treatment Center OHSU . Strength Subjects grip strength measure hand hold dynamometry . The Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer use assess bilateral grip strength subject , use protocol set forth Jamar Owner 's Manual . Gross Motor Proficiency Gross motor proficiency assess utilize follow subtests Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency , Second Edition ( BOT-2™ ) : Upper-Limb Coordination , Bilateral Coordination , Balance , Running Speed , Agility Strength . Prior administration subtests , researcher determine subject 's hand foot preference writing , throw , kicking , use within subtest require use preferred extremity . Testing environment test administration conform protocol set BOT-2™ Administration Manual .</detailed_description>
