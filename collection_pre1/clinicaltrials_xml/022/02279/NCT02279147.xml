	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Anticholinesterase drug cholinergic M receptor antagonist apply patient obstructive jaundice operation . PURPOSE : This clinical trial design low incidence mortality operation complication patient obstructive jaundice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway Prevention &amp; Treatment SIRS Patients With Jaundice After Operation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Ⅰ.Judge whether effect inhibit inflammation , anti oxidative stress anti apoptosis alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activate . Ⅱ.Judge whether effect reduce incidence mortality operation complication use Cholinesterase inhibitor M cholinergic receptor block agent Patients obstructive jaundice operation。 OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group accord order enrollment . Group 1 : Patients receive neostigmine methylsulfate raceanisodamine hydrochloride day 0,1,2 operation . Group 2 : Patients receive special treatment operation . All patient monitor observed index day operation one day , three day , five day operation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ⅰ.Accompanied obstructive jaundice plan implement liver resection hilar bile duct carcinoma . Patients carcinoma head pancreas plan implement pancreaticoduodenectomy . Ⅱ . Drugs use clinical trial safe patient . Ⅲ.The patient occur complication would affect experimental observation seriously operation . Ⅳ.The patient agree participate clinical trial sign inform consent . Ⅰ.Patients unwilling accept clinical trial researcher believe patient compliance requirement clinical research . Ⅱ.Patients tumor metastases widely accept predetermined operation scheme . Ⅲ . The postoperative complication therapeutic measure take affect experimental observation seriously .</criteria>
