	<brief_summary>Tumor genotyping become essential biomarker care advance lung cancer melanoma , currently use identify patient treatment target kinase inhibitor like erlotinib vemurafenib . However , tumor genotyping slow cumbersome , limited availability tumor biopsy tissue test . The aim study prospectively evaluate blood-based genotyping tool quantify presence oncogenic mutation ( EGFR , KRAS , BRAF ) patient lung cancer melanoma . This assay study diagnostic tool classify patient genotype , serial measurement tool quantification response progression therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria To participate study participant must meet eligibility one follow cohort : Cohort 1 : Cancers begin initial treatment One follow diagnosis : Cohort 1A ( CLOSED ) : Advanced nonsquamous NSCLC ( include adenosquamous ) Cohort 1B : Stage IIIII nonsquamous NSCLC ( include adenosquamous ) Stage IIIBIV melanoma Patient must plan begin initial therapy , completely resect receive adjuvant therapy For patient NSCLC , EGFR KRAS genotype may know unknown For patient melanoma , BRAF NRAS genotype may know unknown For patient without tumor genotyping , must plan genotyping include either : Archived tumor tissue available plan genotyping A biopsy future time anticipate available genotyping Cohort 2 : Cancers acquire resistance target therapy One follow diagnosis : Cohort 2A ( CLOSED ) : Advanced NSCLC harbor know EGFR mutation Cohort 2B : Advanced NSCLC harbor targetable genotype EGFR Advanced melanoma harbor know tumor genotype Clinical determination progression target therapy , evidence plan start new systemic treatment regimen , obtain biopsy plan new treatment regimen New systemic treatment regimen plan OR Rebiopsy resistance genotyping plan Note , date target therapy start clinical progression must provide Cohort 3 : Cancers know genotype start palliative systemic therapy Cohort 3A ( CLOSED ) : Advanced NSCLC harbor one follow mutation : EGFR exon 19 deletion EGFR L858R EGFR T790M KRAS G12X BRAF V600E Patients must initiate palliative systemic therapy , either clinical trial Cohort 4 : Paired plasma NGS ddPCR Cohort 4A ( CLOSED ) : Advanced NSCLC , newly diagnose progression follow treatment . Biopsy tissue must available biopsy plan one following : Genotyping must perform previously Genotyping must progress A plan must exist order genotyping exist tissue plan rebiopsy Patient must eligible enroll cohort 1A 2A due : Not eligible cohort 1A 2A Eligible cohort 1A 2A cohort close Cohort 4B : Undergenotyped NSCLC Advanced NSCLC , newly diagnose progression follow treatment . No know targetable genotype prior tumor genotyping Biopsy plan tumor genotyping Cohort 4C : EGFRmutant NSCLC acquire resistance Advanced EGFRmutant NSCLC progression EGFR TKI Biopsy plan resistance genotyping ( e.g . T790M , etc ) Exclusion Criteria Participants unable provide inform consent Participants 18 year age young Participants unable comply study procedure</criteria>
