	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common cardiac arrhythmia major risk ischemic stroke . Furthermore risk stroke high first month transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) /stroke . Rivaroxaban approve Health Canada period last two year prevention stroke find equally effective oral Vitamin K antagonist . The foremost benefit NOAC reduce intracranial bleeding risk require coagulation monitoring . Optimal time anticoagulation TIA/stroke patient know non-valvular atrial fibrillation know . The practice variable opinion base . The bias many stroke physician neurologist start later ( 1-2weeks ) prevent hemorrhagic transformation thus possibly expose patient increase risk recurrence . The product monograph drug suggest wait variable 3 14 day start NOAC ( Waiting period:14 day dabigatran rivaroxaban , 7 day Apixaban ischemic stroke three day TIA rivaroxaban ) . The time choose arbitrary . The investigator aim study incidence symptomatic hemorrhage patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation initiate new oral anticoagulant early TIA stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : It clearly establish patient atrial fibrillation suffer stroke/TIA high risk recurrence require long-term anticoagulation . What unknown optimal timing anticoagulation ischemic stroke occur . Following cardioembolic stroke , atrial fibrillation patient risk early recurrent thrombo-embolism . Estimates rate recurrent stroke set vary widely . Previous study indicate new ischemic stroke occur rate anywhere 3 % 20 % within two week index event . This primary rationale early anticoagulation cardioembolic stroke . There evidence early anticoagulation associate improved outcome ischemic stroke . Indeed , show early heparin use reduce recurrent ischemic stroke risk 2.1 % , offset 1.7 % increase rate HT . Studies low molecular weight unfractionated heparin use acute stroke generally indicate agent associate moderately increase risk HT . There currently data indicate frequency HT associate early warfarin treatment , without heparin bridging . Based evidence , current best practice guideline recommend urgent anticoagulation patient moderate severe ischemic stroke , however , due elevate risk hemorrhagic transformation ( HT ) immediately stroke . A specific time point begin anticoagulation recommend guideline statement . This clinical equipoise result significant variation practice pattern . Currently , CSC physicians base timing anticoagulation clinical severity infarct size , see CT scan . Most physician defer anticoagulation anywhere 5 14 day ischemic stroke infarct volume extensive . In patient small infarct volume , assess CT MRI , however , anticoagulation often begin within 24-72 hour stroke onset , case immediately clinical assessment CT scan . Currently , Bayer data relate early use rivaroxaban TIA ischemic stroke . Although randomize study delay versus early anticoagulation rivaroxaban ideally answer question , moment , feasibility safety data . There also insufficient data present literature indicate true event rate symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation recurrent cerebral ischemia . These data obtain prospectively collect clinical imaging data patient treat , per standard clinical practice Canadian stroke centre , within 14-day period clinical uncertainty . The result registry used ass safety feasibility large randomize control trial early versus delay rivaroxaban use stroke/TIA . Study Design : The Rivaroxaban Acute Stroke Safety Study ( RASS ) investigator initiate multi-center , prospective , open label , single arm phase IV study . Objectives Hypothesis : The primary aim Rivaroxaban Acute Stroke Study registry demonstrate safety early anticoagulation rivaroxaban follow cardioembolic stroke TIA . Safety establish demonstrate low rate hemorrhage set . The secondary study objective document rate recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic event . It fully recognize uncontrolled registry study properly design under-powered demonstrate reduction cerebrovascular ischemic event . The investigator hypothesize early initiation rivaroxaban within first 14 day stroke TIA associate increase symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage . Baseline Data ( within 14 day TIA/minor stroke ) : Standard clinical assessment data collect . This include baseline National Institutes Health Stroke Scale NIHSS , Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) , Montreal Cognitive Score ( MoCA ) vital sign , record case report form . Stroke risk factor , past medical history medication , baseline complete blood count , coagulation profile renal function test also record . Treatment : Patients treat rivaroxaban within 14 day symptom onset accord practice pattern attend stroke physician . The study participation would consider patient initiated Rivaroxaban . The dose rivaroxaban determine age renal function . Patients &gt; 80 year old and/or GFR 30-50 ml/min receive 15 mg qd , patient receive 20 mg qd . The study team member would approach patient possible recruitment study obtain informed consent . Imaging Procedures : Acute baseline CT scan collect ( standard care ) . All patient MRI include susceptibility weight imaging recruitment within first 24 hour follow-up MRI scan 7±2 day enrolment , order assess early asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation . In event clinical deterioration , repeat CT scan perform immediately . The investigator hypothesize micro-hemorrhages may predict symptomatic bleeding . In addition , supplemental brain imaging complete within first 30 day enrolment collect . Clinical Follow-up Assessments : All patient follow 90 day . This standard post-stroke assessment period ( majority neurological functional recovery occurs within time frame ) . Patients assess clinically Day 1 , Day 7 , Day 90 . At visit , patient examine stroke Fellow and/or Neurologist . On visit , vital sign note , comprehensive neurologic examination perform mRS NIHSS record . Patients interview detail identify ascertain recurrent vascular event suggestive stroke TIA . Work-up determine underlie etiology stroke review change management plan record . Statistical Analysis Plan Power Calculation : The primary outcome test single sample t-test . The null hypothesis frequency symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation &lt; 2 % . A convenience sample 50 patient plan initially . This provide initial safety feasibility data use plan future definitive study require . The primary efficacy analysis intention-to-treat basis . Data Safety Monitoring Adverse Event Reporting : Investigators report serious adverse event ( SAE ) , use standardized event , resolution association code . The SAE reporting period include entire treatment duration additional week . All SAEs report . Non-serious Adverse Events ( AEs ) unrelated rivaroxaban treatment report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient ≥ 18 year age . All patient diagnosis minor ischemic stroke , define NIHSS score ≤ 8 , Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , define acute focal neurological deficit , complete resolution symptom within 24 h onset . In case onset time establish , consider time patient last know well . Atrial Fibrillation ( AF , paroxysmal persistent ) . AF must confirm ECG/Holter monitor , history ( clinical documentation previous AF must provide ) . All include patient prescribe rivaroxaban follow stroke/TIA . Acute chronic renal failure , define eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) . Known hypersensitivity rivaroxaban . Prior treatment rivaroxaban novel oral anticoagulant ( include Factor Xa antagonist ) . Treatment warfarin prior stroke/TIA acceptable , enrolment begin INR ≤2.0 . Any significant ongoing systemic bleeding risk , i.e . active GI/GU bleeding recent major surgery . Any condition , judgment investigator could impose hazard patient study therapy initiate affect participation patient study . Recent past history clinical presentation ICH , subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) , arteriovenous ( AV ) malformation , aneurysm , cerebral neoplasm . At discretion Investigator .
