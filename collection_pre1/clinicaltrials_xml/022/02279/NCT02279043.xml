	<brief_summary>This study look woman 's social communication IUDs ( intrauterine device ) attitude behavior relate IUD use . The researcher design online community woman talk experience birth control . We examine whether social exposure IUD user set associated change attitude behavior among woman never IUD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : University Pennsylvania researcher conduct randomize controlled trial examine whether association social exposure woman use intrauterine contraception ( IUC ) method birth control change IUC attitude behavior among woman never use IUC . The intervention use test association online social community , design researcher , woman invite share personal experience birth control method use . Non-IUC user participant randomize either intervention control condition . The intervention condition consist small online social group non-IUC user participant interact IUC user participant . The control condition consist online group identical intervention group , except IUC user participant group . Participants interact within small group twelve day . Non-IUC user participant complete survey twelve-day intervention measure IUC attitudes behavior . UCSF researcher conduct analysis deidentified data obtain study . Hypothesis : It hypothesize among woman never use IUC , association social exposure IUC user change attitude behavior relate IUC use . It also hypothesize exposure IUC user associate positive change knowledge IUC use efficacy positive change IUC-related information-seeking . Aims : The study three aim : Aim 1 : To determine whether exposure IUC user online community associate change woman 's attitude behavior relate IUC use . Aim 2 : To determine whether association exposure IUC user change woman 's IUC attitudes behavior varies woman 's race/ethnicity . Aim 3 : To observe content woman 's interaction IUC birth control method online social community . Data analysis : In order address Aim 1 , first conduct univariate analysis obtain descriptive statistic ( include mean , median , mode , variance , range ) demographic characteristic IUC attitude behavior among participant intervention control group . In bivariate analysis , use chi-square test examine relationship study condition IUC-related behavior , measure post-survey . We use t-tests examine relationship condition post-survey IUC attitude , match t-tests examine relationship condition change IUC attitude . If data attitude normally distribute , use appropriate non-parametric test instead t-tests . We also use chi-square test t-tests ( non-parametric test ) examine association demographic characteristic IUC-related attitude behavior . Multivariate analysis Aim 1 include mixed-effects regression examine association individual cluster level . We use multiple linear regression continuous outcome multiple logistic regression binary outcome . Regression model test association intervention control condition outcome IUC attitude behavior variable . Those background demographic variable find significant bivariate relationship outcome IUC attitude behavior variable enter control model . We obtain regression coefficient linear regression model odds ratio logistic regression model order describe association study arm outcome . In order address Aim 2 , examine bivariate relationship racial/ethnic category participant outcome attitude behavior variable , use chi-square test binary outcomes t-tests appropriate non-parametric test continuous outcome . We use multiple linear and/or logistic regression test possible association race/ethnicity outcome variable , control background variable . Resulting regression coefficient odds ratio describe whether effect intervention great woman racial/ethnic group compare others . In order address Aim 3 , perform qualitative analysis conversation take place among group member online social group , use ground theory methodology . We examine qualitative data intervention control group . Privacy : Recruitment participation study occur online . Participants interact study remote location , see enter leave location affiliate study , interact study personnel . Once registered study , participant contact via secure email indicate nature study subject line . The study website password-protected prohibit access Internet user participate study . Participants ' screen name site contain real name , identifiable study participant . There minimal risk privacy loss . Study participant may want others know interest use birth control , may feel embarrassment shame event loss study privacy . Additionally , birth control use may sensitive topic personal relationship study participant , loss privacy could lead strain conflict personal relationship . Confidentiality : Data collect researcher University Pennsylvania store secure network site . Only University Pennsylvania study staff access data network . University PEnnsylvania staff remove identifier data export data researcher UCSF via secure email . Deidentified data store secure UCSF server . Only study staff access data , access key .</detailed_description>
