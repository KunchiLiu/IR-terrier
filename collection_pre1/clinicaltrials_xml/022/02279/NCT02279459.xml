	<brief_summary>The purpose study utilize dual-energy compute tomography ( DECT ) investigate change tumor iodine concentration patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . Dual-energy computerized tomography could easily replace standard CT neck add benefit provide functional information would possible advanced computerize tomography perfusion , magnetic resonance diffusion ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual-Energy CT Patients With Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients head and/or neck tumor routinely head neck imaging complete computerized tomography scan , commonly call CT scan . A CT scan combine series x-ray view take many different angle use computer process create cross-sectional image inside body . These cross-sectional image thin slice , often less 1 mm thick allow radiologist examine part tissue closely . Dual energy compute tomography ( DECT ) fairly new technology use normal x-ray also second less powerful x-ray make image . The Ottawa Hospital scanner use able take image oncologists typically order patient also set obtain DECT image time . The purpose study investigate whether DECT image provide helpful information well predict tumor respond treatment likely course head neck tumor .</detailed_description>
