	<detailed_description>Premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) common arrhythmia observe absence structural heart disease , 'frequent ' PVCs estimate occur 1-4 % general population.1 Idiopathic PVCs usually associate benign course standpoint arrhythmic death , often result significant symptom patient palpitation , dizziness , pre-syncope rarely syncope . More recently , new concept PVC- mediate cardiomyopathy emerge reversible suppression PVCs.2 Both patient population currently target PVC suppressive therapy often involve first step use medical therapy beta blocker , calcium channel blocker antiarrhythmic . If fail patient want avoid medical therapy ablation eliminate abnormal myocardial tissue origin PVCs often perform . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) PVCs perform several decade well-defined safety effectiveness profile patient symptomatic frequent ventricular ectopic beat PVC-induced cardiomyopathy . Successful PVC suppression â‰¥80 % RV LV PVCs report high ~80 % use ablation approach.9 Studies find improvement patient symptom elimination PVCs . In LV dysfunction follow ablation demonstrate significant inverse correlation EF PVC burden ablation , significant post procedural improvement ejection fraction ( EF ) 82 % patient abnormal systolic function ablation.8 Improvement overall LV EF range 13 % -23 % PVC ablation.5,8,10 Autonomic innervation heart play major role normal regulation myocardial function , heart rate , coronary blood flow . Abnormal sympathetic cardiac innervation show prognostic value different heart disease , e.g . heart transplant , coronary artery disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , etc . Importantly , clear association increase cardiac morbidity mortality heart disease . Patients myocardial infarction well patient heart failure exhibit well recognize abnormality autonomic tone . PVCs especially set preserve EF ( normal heart patient ) frequently automatic/triggered mechanism , influence cardiac innervation . Decreased reuptake impaired myocardial presynaptic nerve terminal result buildup catecholamine synaptic cleft . This lead downregulation postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor , resultant worsen cardiomyopathy increase arrhythmogenesis . Cardiac sympathetic innervation directly image commonly use nuclear radioisotope , 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-mIBG ) . As norepinephrine analogue , 123I-mIBG similarly release synaptic cleft response sympathetic input presynaptic nerve terminal 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-MIBG ) allow visualization cardiac innervation , could provide additional information understand origin , prognosis pathophysiology PVCs guide potential ablation procedure .</detailed_description>
