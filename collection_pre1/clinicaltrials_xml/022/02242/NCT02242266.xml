	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial establish non-inferiority lung function response tiotropium 10 μg , formulate inhalation powder polyethylene hard capsule deliver via HandiHaler® 2 , compare tiotropium 18 μg , formulate inhalation powder hard gelatine capsule deliver via HandiHaler® ( Spiriva® ) follow single dose inhalation patient COPD . A hard polyethylene ( PE ) capsule half strength ( tiotropium 5 μg ) include investigate dose order effect . The secondary objective characterize pharmacokinetics tiotropium inhalation powder hard PE capsule ( deliver via HandiHaler® 2 ) tiotropium inhalation powder hard gelatine capsule ( deliver via HandiHaler® ) compare safety two pharmaceutical formulation .</brief_summary>
