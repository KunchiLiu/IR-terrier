	<detailed_description>More 90 % malaria occur sub-Saharan Africa ( WHO 2008 ) , region bear 67 % global HIV burden ( WHO 2011 ) . Given extensive overlap geographical distribution disease , interaction could profound public health consequence . Significant biological interaction exist HIV malaria . HIV known increase susceptibility malaria infection ( Whitworth , Morgan et al . 2000 ) , compromise host 's ability clear malaria parasite ( characterise high parasite density ) ( Francesconi , Fabiani et al . 2001 ) , increase risk symptomatic malaria contribute malaria treatment failure ( Hewitt , Steketee et al . 2006 ) . In area unstable transmission , malaria mortality high HIV-positive individual . Additionally , placental malaria infection HIV positive individual associate high perinatal mortality , low birth weight HIV transmission , effect attenuate subsequent pregnancy , contrast HIV-negative individual . Conversely , malaria infection show increase HIV viral load ( Hoffman , Jere et al . 1999 , Kublin , Patnaik et al . 2005 ) , potential accelerate HIV disease progression increase HIV transmission ( Abu-Raddad , Patnaik et al . 2006 ) . As September 2011 , Uganda 1.4 million people living HIV/AIDS ; clinically advance disease , 54 % ( 313 117 ) receive ART ( WHO ) . As southern African country scale coverage ART , also step fight Pf malaria increase coverage Insecticide Treated Nets adopt use artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) first line treatment malaria ( USAID 2011 ) . AL AS-AQ commonly utilize regimen sub-Saharan Africa first line treatment malaria ( WHO 2008 ) . As consequence high rate HIV-malaria co-infection increase availability ACTs ART southern Africa , progressively co-infected people receive class drug . However , pharmacokinetics , safety and/or efficacy ACTs AL , AS-AQ DHA-piperaquine HIV-infected individual ART poorly understood . Many efficacy study conduct part drug development process ACTs either assess HIV status study participant systematically exclude HIV-infected individual . Few study systematically evaluate potential drug-drug interaction healthy volunteer set . Study Design Open label , fix sequence healthy volunteer study compare pharmacokinetic interaction DTG AL ( Study A ; crossover design ) , AS-AQ ( Study B ; parallel group design ) . Whilst cross-over study design would theoretically ideal investigate ACTs combination DTG , desethylamodiaquine , active metabolite AQ extensive terminal t1/2 approximately 10 day ; therefore consider feasible undertake cross-over design arm study , since washout period two phase would exceed two month , risk subject attrition . Furthermore , time period , intercurrent illness important change may occur within subject , leading change eligibility study . Therefore , two study design plan detailed Study Design Section .</detailed_description>
