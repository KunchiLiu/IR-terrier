	<brief_summary>Symptomatic treatment negative symptom schizophrenia ( social withdrawal , affective flattening , poor motivation , apathy ) medication psychotherapy almost non-existent , whereas treatment positive symptom ( hallucination delusion ) effective psychotropic medication . The propose research human subject use non-invasive technology ( repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [ rTMS ] ) provide efficacy data treat negative symptom . The hypothesis 1 ) Cerebellar stimulation cause activation thalamic frontal cortical network associate attentional process component `` distracted '' affect schizophrenia ; 2 ) Cerebellar stimulation cause activation reticular activate system ( RAS ) , allow `` mutism '' , negative symptom , partially improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance There increase evidence neuropsychological imaging study cerebellar function relevant motor coordination , equally cognition behavior ( Rapoport et al. , 2000 ) . Selective modulation cerebello-thalamocortical pathway , turn , believe provide additional mean modulate cortical function . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) modulate cortical excitability focally conscious subject . Trains slow frequency ( i.e.,1 Hz ) know suppress cortical excitability ( Chen et al. , 1997 ) , whereas facilitation occur frequency higher 5 Hz use ( Berardelli et al. , 1998 ) . With respect rTMS cerebellum , major impact cognitive function ( Oliveri et al. , 2007 ) describe . The cerebellum good candidate generator intracortical inhibition ; stimulation modulate cortical inhibition . Invasive study Robert Heath Tulane University reveal cerebellum strongly connect 2 structure core propose abnormal circuitry schizophrenia , septal nucleus hippocampus ( HC ) . According theory finding , septal nuclei involved positive mood regulation , pleasure . The fire HC correlate negative affect sadness ( Heath et al , 1980 ) . By stimulate fastigial nucleus vermis cerebellum , septal nucleus facilitate fire HC inhibit . The component Heath refer `` aversive system '' , amygdala also inhibit . This central role cerebellum circuit analogous role `` smoothing '' flow movement . When consider emotion cognition , cerebellum smooth function . Aside direct monosynaptic connection site , evidence deep cerebellar nucleus connect parietal cortex , temporal cortex , well cingulate gyrus . These area limbic function . The cerebellum also directly connect midbrain reticular activating system ( RAS ) . This region responsible level consciousness arousal . By potentiate activation RAS , wthe investigator e increase decrease level arousal , many schizophrenia patient akin psychomotor retardation mutism ( catatonic ) . Midline deep cerebellar nuclei efferent trace hypothalamus , central nucleus thalamus , also associative ( cognitive ) limbic function . The Locus Ceruleus substantia nigra , brain stem also monosynaptically connect cerebellum . The cerebellum connect thalamus motor cortex ( frontal cortex ) cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway . And state also connect vast array limbic structure , make good choice use modulate abnormal activity structure . Purkinje cell , output neuron cerebellar cortex reduce excitatory drive deep cerebellar nucleus via ventrolateral thalamus inhibitory neuron motor cortex . Activation Purkinje cell inhibit thalamic drive intracortical inhibitory neuron , therefore , decrease intracortical inhibitory interneuron activity decrease SICI CSP . On hand , inhibition Purkinje cerebellar cell expect opposite effect release thalamus inhibitory control , increase thalamic drive stimulate inhibitory interneurons demonstrate increase SICI CSP Indeed , apply inhibitory rTMS frequency 1 Hz result increase SICI ( Langguth et al. , 2008 ) . The midline deep cerebellar nucleus , anatomically phylogenetically related vermis , also send collateral reticular activate system ( RAS ) brain stem . By increase excitatory ( Glu ) drive RAS , subject experience increase awareness connection environment . For decade , cerebellum think predominantly involved motor performance cognitive operation . Recently , however , grow body evidence indicate cerebellum also involved emotion . The first evidence cerebellar involvement emotion come work Robert G. Heath early fifty . Although initial work predominantly involved electrical stimulation septum , begin research stimulation cerebellum , think might provide good entry emotional circuitry brain . Several cerebellar pacemaker study Heath indeed demonstrate positive effect mood personality patient psychiatric illness electrical stimulation cerebellum . Moreover , Schmahmann Sherman provide clinical support role cerebellum particularly vermis regulation emotion mood . Given modulatory role emotion , midline cerebellar vermis together fastigial nucleus flocculonodular lobe designate limbic cerebellum ( Schutter van Honk 2005 ) . Furthermore , additional evidence involvement cerebellum schizophrenia support genetic , structural functional imaging data ( Sandyk et al. , 1991 ; Nopoulos et al. , 1999 ; Ichimiya et al. , 2001 ; Varnas et al. , 2007 ) well clinical evidence ( Deshmukh et al. , 2002 ; Ho et al. , 2004 ; Varambally et al. , 2006 ) . For example , animal model schizophrenia use prenatal infection mouse human influenza virus , animal develop behavioral change similar schizophrenia associate altered expression cerebellar gene ( Fatemi et al. , 2008 ) . Some study report small bilateral cerebellar volume compare control first episode schizophrenia patient ( Bottmer et al. , 2005 ) . One first study demonstrate importance dysfunctional cerebellar circuitry schizophrenia positron emission tomography ( PET ) study ( Andreasen et al. , 1996 ) . The author examine memory performance schizophrenia patient correlate blood flow cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway . They use two task memory , namely easy relatively difficult one . While patient schizophrenia show normal performance easy practiced memory task already demonstrate decreased blood flow cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway . By contrast , relatively difficult memory task , schizophrenia patient perform bad healthy control display significantly lower frontal cerebellar blood flow ( Andreasen et al. , 1996 ) . Consistent assume disruption cerebellothalamo- cortical pathway schizophrenia evidence two proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( HMRS ) study . Lower level N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , marker neuron density viability , find thalamus cerebellar vermis ( Deicken et al. , 2001 ) patient schizophrenia . In keep finding , low NAA level vermis cerebellar cortex also find ( Ende et al. , 2005 ) well mediodorsal region thalamus ( Ende et al. , 2001 ) . In addition , poor executive functioning patient schizophrenia associate volumetric reduction cerebello-thalamo-cortical network ( Rusch et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) study show patient schizophrenia demonstrate abnormality connectivity cerebellum thalamus possible difference right leave cerebellum ( Magnota et al. , 2008 ) . Investigating connectivity cerebellum thalamus schizophrenia use diffusion tensor tractography : A pilot study ) . Another DTI study find neuronal disorganization superior peduncle neuronal disorganization associate poor cognitive performance ( Okugawa et al. , 2006 ) . Finally , activity right leave cerebellum may . For example , impair work memory schizophrenia associate under-activation along cerebellothalamo- cortical pathway under-activation leave DLPFC right cerebellum over-activation leave cerebellum ( Mendrek et al. , 2005 ) . To date , cerebellar involvement schizophrenia remain subject ongoing study . It show motor impairment schizophrenia relate cerebellar malfunction . Several study report cerebellum indeed involved cognitive ( Eyler et al. , 2004 ; Aasen et al. , 2005 ; Kiehl et al. , 2005 ) affective ( Paradiso et al. , 2003 ; Takahashi et al. , 2004 ; Stip et al. , 2005 ) impairment . This study aim clarify role cerebellum development negative symptom regulation cortical inhibition , activation septal region reciprocal inactivation hippocampus , RAS activation . Experimental Design Methods/Procedures 1. rTMS vermis cerebellum 2 . 5 sessions/week 1 week 3 . Randomization explain . Patients randomly assign either high frequency low frequency Medial Cerebellum Target Treatment protocol . Each group enter randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled , parallel-design clinical trial consist three main phase : ( 1 ) Baseline Psychiatric Psychometric Testing Exam ; ( 2 ) 5 rTMS treatment , double-blind , 5 treatment sessions/week active sham rTMS period 1 week ; ( 3 ) follow-up period 3 week . The patient reassign Frequency ( either high low ) Arm study . The protocol repeat . Patients investigator , except investigator apply rTMS , blind treatment arm .</detailed_description>
