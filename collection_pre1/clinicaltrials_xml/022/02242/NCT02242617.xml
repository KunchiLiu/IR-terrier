	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) major health problem affect 1,000,000 Canadians . It cause significant healthcare cost increase morbidity mortality . The two common effective therapy use treat OSA : ( 1 ) Continuous Automatic Positive Airway Pressure ( PAP ) , ( 2 ) Mandibular Advancement Splints ( MAS ) . While therapy reduce upper airway collapse sleep , differ efficacy , acceptance , cost side-effects , surprisingly similar improving quality life , sleepiness blood pressure . PAP effective reduce apneas MAS easy use . Until , study use self-reported adherence data MAS versus objective adherence PAP . Many study hypothesize sub-optimal efficacy MAS therapy counterbalance superior adherence relative PAP , result similar effectiveness treatment . Compliance smart chip recent innovation MAS could use prove hypothesis allow new complete comparison effectiveness ( efficacy + adherence ) MAS PAP . Understanding patient 's objective adherence long-term symptomatic improvement would provide vital information doctor dentists choose right treatment patient . Sixty OSA patient receive PAP MAS random sequence . This innovative study lead two experienced new investigator , research team multidisciplinary expert , assess objective adherence , treatment efficacy , patient preference , sleepiness quality life treatment use home 1 month per treatment . After , patient able go back forth treatment additional 6-month period . The result study used healthcare policy maker well clinician need part treatment plan decision many Canadians suffer sleep apnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study assess objective adherence treatment , PAP MAS , evaluate similar effectiveness ( efficacy+adherence ) PAP MAS treatment patient mild severe OSA . The secondary aim ass patient preference correlate final treatment adherence . An exploratory aim ass strategy patient treatment available use interchangeably could improve treatment adherence , sleepiness , quality life fatigue . Having good insight patient adherence improve cost-effectiveness treatment improve health quality life many Canadians suffer sleep apnea . The propose trial randomize open-label , two-treatment , two-period cross-over trial follow observational trial . Sixty OSA patient ( 10≤AHI≤50 ) receive PAP MAS . As recent innovation , adherence monitor MAS give new comprehensive comparative analysis effectiveness MAS PAP . In randomized trial phase two treatment use separately 1 month ( treatment adaptation/titration 1-2 month device ) . Treatment efficacy daily treatment use data assess together change symptom ( quality life , sleepiness fatigue ) . Patient initial preference determine use patient decision aid . This follow observational trial phase , patient access intervention home 6 month allow choose daily basis intervention use . The intervention duration 6 month allow sustain response long-term adherence observe change quality life .</detailed_description>
