	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) frequent inflammatory arthritis lead severe joint deformity often require orthopaedic surgical intervention . Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α ( anti-TNFα ) biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) increasingly use treatment rheumatoid arthritis . An increase risk opportunistic infection demonstrate patient treated drug . This observation lead many national committee recommend anti-TNFα suspension perioperative period avoid raise postoperative infection risk patient . This approach support data available current literature expose patient increase risk inflammatory flare ups disease anti-TNFα suspension , compromise postoperative rehabilitation quality life . The objective prospective randomize multicentric trial determine effect anti-TNFα suspension perioperative period postoperative infection risk . Overall , 660 rheumatoid arthritis patient require elective foot ankle surgery randomize two group . In first group , anti-TNFα stop 3 half-lives surgery continued second group . The postoperative infection rate compare two group . Postoperative complication rate , flare revision surgery well functional improvement compare . The study hypothesis significant difference risk postoperative infection two group . Results study help determine optimal way use anti-TNFα perioperative period therefore improve quality life rheumatoid arthritis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-TNFα Use During Elective Foot Ankle Surgery Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . STUDY DESIGN This prospective randomize multicentric trial . Patients randomize two group . Patients Group A continue anti-TNF treatment whole perioperative period . Anti-TNFα medication suspend prior surgery patient randomize Group B . This design allow u minimize important selection bias affect observational study previously conduct topic . Due safety concern , patient evaluator blind treatment . B . RESEARCH LOCATION Considering important number patient require , plan conduct multicentric study . This allow u recruit enough patient reasonable time frame ensure sufficient power result . The main center data gather CHU de Québec . Other center Canada invite participate study maximum 10 center . C. INTERVENTION Medication Patients randomize Group A continue anti-TNFα treatment unaltered whole perioperative period . Surgery perform without consideration regard time treatment . The time elapse last anti-TNFα administration surgery nonetheless document . Patients randomize Group B anti-TNFα therapy interrupt surgery . There consensus optimal time anti-TNFα suspension surgery . Many publish guideline suggest pharmacokinetics different anti-TNFα medication important consideration perioperative management drug . Different author suggest anti-TNFα therapy suspend two five half-lives prior surgery . Similar timing use previous publication . In current trial , anti-TNFα suspend three half-lives ( ± seven day ) prior surgery . All medication use treatment disease ( methotrexate , hydroxychloroquine , corticosteroid , etc . ) document continued perioperative period . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) suspend seven day prior surgery restart postoperatively . Anti-TNFα restart wound heal complete . Surgery All surgery perform experimented orthopaedic surgeon . Surgical technique determine treat surgeon subject randomization . For analysis purpose , surgery subdivide surgery without permanent implant . It also divide forefoot , midfoot , hindfoot ankle surgery . Use prophylactic antibiotic standardize follow : - Cephalexin 2g IV incision , - Clindamycin 600mg IV incision patient allergic cephalexin D. RANDOMIZATION Randomization complete soon inclusion exclusion criterion verify patient give informed consent . Patients randomized treatment Group A B. Randomization perform block 10 use web site Randomizer.org . Blocks 10 number , seal opaque envelope send participate center . E. FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE Patients follow one year surgery . There go one visit surgery five follow-up visit two week , six week , three month , six month 12 month surgery . F. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION We calculate sample size need test equivalence two group statistical power 80 % type I error ( alpha ) 5 % . The observed rate infection follow foot ankle surgery RA patient varies greatly literature [ 46 ] . For purpose sample size calculation , use 5 % rate infection consider relative risk 2 clinically significant . N1 = N2 = 2* ( ( 1.96+0.845 ) /0.05 ) ^2*0.05* ( 1-0.05 ) = 299 Considering rate lose follow-up 15 % , conclude sample 660 patient , 330 treatment group , would provide u relevant result . G. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive analysis Demographic data baseline clinical characteristic obtain analyze . For continuous variable , mean , median , standard deviation well maximum minimum value go present group . For categorical variable , frequency proportion go present . All variable go compare two group use Student 's T-test continuous variable Chi-squared test categorical variable . Main analysis The main outcome analysis go make use Chi-squared test . The gross surgical site infection ( SSI ) relative risk two group calculate . The relative risk also adjust use multivariate regression analysis consider relevant demographic variable . The model include , limited , variable statistically different two group . Secondary outcomes related disease flare , poor wound heal reoperation rate also analyze use Chi-squared test . A linear regression model repeat measure use compare functional score improvement two group . Sub-group analysis perform . They include analysis type surgery , use permanent implant , baseline disease activity level type anti-TNFα use . Interim analysis An interim analysis perform midpoint recruitment period look significant difference primary outcome two group . The analysis take place 330 patient follow least six week surgery . Based obtained result , decision interrupt trial could eventually make safety committee .</detailed_description>
