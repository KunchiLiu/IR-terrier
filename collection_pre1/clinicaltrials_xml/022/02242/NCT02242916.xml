	<brief_summary>Given cost proton therapy considerably higher conventional radiotherapy photon , necessary establish whether high cost worthwhile light expect advantages2,3,4 . Thus , clear evidence situation proton therapy outperforms conventional photon treatment need . The investigator therefore aim demonstrate silico trial proton therapy decrease amount irradiate normal tissue , consequently , risk side effect surround normal tissue well risk secondary tumor . The overall treatment time equal number fraction use treatment modality wherever possible . The optimal technique individual patient , base objective criterion relate limit dose normal tissue , prescribed institution concern treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CTV PTV margin determine individual institute accord treatment technique treatment modality . For treatment plan , modify ICRU 50 apply . The ICRU 50 recommendation 100 % target volume ( PTV ) receive least 95 % prescribe dose . In work , participant agree D98 &gt; = 95 % , D2 &lt; = 107 % , cold ( &lt; 95 % ) hot ( &gt; 107 % ) spot avoid general , hot spot allow outside PTV . The overall treatment time ( OTT ) equal number fraction use treatment modality . Treatment plan carry use either photon , proton C-ions dose calculation indication H &amp; N re-irradiation . A multicentric patient dataset , find secure website5,6 , use . The output database matrix include 3D delineation , deliverable physical dose , RBE map , BED/ EQD2 make available . To guarantee similar set-up three treatment , similar dose distribution use . For C-ion treatment planning , 20 % uncertainty RBE value take account . All treatment plan perform center already operate experience treatment planning . Photon treatment plan carry Nijmegen en Maastricht , proton treatment plan University Pennsylvania ( UPENN ) C-ion treatment plan University Hospital Marburg ( UHM ) . For photon , primary treatment plan perform accord planning procedure individual participating center select best available technique . The secondary photon treatment plan perform accord predefined fractionation schedule tumor dose . The proton treatment plan H &amp; N tumor plan active beam delivery use IMPT and/or passive 4D beam delivery ( PSPT ) . The C-ion treatment plan plan use raster-scanning technique ( IMIT ) . All relevant OAR delineate primary secondary study set . GTV/CTV use accordingly actual treatment . New DVH 's calculate add OAR . The secondary plan ( i.e . re-irradiation plan ) calculate best currently available option Photon , proton C-ions . Between primary secondary treatment period 1 5 year patient . To save site 30 % recovery brainstem spinal cord assume . There correction fraction size . For practical reason location Dmax brainstem spinal cord take account . A maximal cumulative dose 120 Gy accept mandibular . If mandibular part CTV first well second treatment , high dose accept . A cumulative dose max 120 Gy also accept larynx , arytenoid 100Gy , unless larynx within CTV first second treatment high dose accept . This mean total study population 25 patient per tumor site group least 100 treatment plan carry . All dose map save secure website part database mention . Photon , proton C-ion treatment compare base dosimetric parameter normal tissue mean parotic dose , etc . In addition , NTCP fix tumor dose expect TCP determine . Cobalt Gy equivalent dos use report proton C-ion dose . In case proton , constant RBE value 1.1 used tumor normal tissue . The RBE C-ions calculate base model use participate center . The GSI in-house treatment planning system use RBE value calculate basis local effect model ( LEM ) . The LEM I ( alpha/beta=2 ) base radial dose distribution charge particle cross cell nucleus , well radiosensitivity repair capacity tissue . The TPSs use UHM also base LEM model . The model use NIRS utilizes fix RBE value dependent depth body , independent dose level tumor type .</detailed_description>
