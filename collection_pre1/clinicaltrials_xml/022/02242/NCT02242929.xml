	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) slow-growing , locally invasive malignant epidermal skin tumour . It common malignant disease Caucasians , represent approximately 80 % case skin cancer therefore important health problem . In Netherlands incidence rate 165 men 157 woman per 100.000 person-years , rate rise 3-10 % every year . A simplified histological classification BCCs include follow three subtypes : nodular , superficial infiltrative variant , nodular variant frequent type . Although characteristic feature BCCs low risk metastasize , untreated may locally invasive may induce considerable functional cosmetic morbidity . The gold standard treatment histological BCC subtypes surgical excision ( SE ) , patient eligible surgery . In patient multiple BCCs older patient , surgery may lead significant morbidity , case , may result disfigure scar . For reason reduce workload cost healthcare system , grow demand alternative , non-invasive , treatment . An advantage non-invasive treatment option perform healthcare professional , general practitioner specialize nurse . For treatment superficial BCCs ( sBCC ) non-invasive treatment , topical imiquimod ( IMQ ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) already commonly use . Our group investigate efficacy three therapy find 3 year , BCCs treat IMQ significant low risk recurrence , compare therapy . A recent study suggest IMQ , besides immune-response modifier , also directly inhibit sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) signalling , important pathway active BCCs . This targeted effect IMQ likely explain superior therapeutic effect . Treatment nodular BCC ( nBCC ) IMQ investigate . Without prior curettage , high efficacy rate find , although efficacy still slightly inferior SE . The investigator hypothesize effectiveness IMQ follow prior curettage inferior SE benefit higher patient satisfaction lower healthcare cost . A recently publish discreet choice experiment show patient preferred IMQ surgery regardless previous experience BCC symptom treatment .</brief_summary>
