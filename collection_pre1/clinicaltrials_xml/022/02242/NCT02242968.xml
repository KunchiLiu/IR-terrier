	<detailed_description>Vaccines antiviral therapy critical prevention treatment viral disease . Among thing , test vaccine antiviral medication require know whether prospective subject previously infect virus study . We recruit healthy person study screen eligibility potentially participate clinical trial investigational licensed vaccine antiviral product . In case involve medical history , physical examination , obtain blood test past exposure one viruses study ongoing upcoming vaccine antiviral therapy trial . In case blood may test viral DNA RNA urine , stool , nasal swab , nasal wash may test virus . Additional testing , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) may also do . Blood sample also store future research . This study help u identify group healthy volunteer eligible , base test prior exposure virus , participate vaccine antiviral therapy trial .</detailed_description>
