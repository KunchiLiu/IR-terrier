	<brief_title>Study Erchonia Low Level Laser Light Therapy Treat Toenail Fungus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An infection toenail fungus , onychomycosis , typically occur fungi ( commonly dermatophytes ) infect nail , may also cause yeast mold . The nail fungal infection usually begin white yellow spot tip toenail spread deep nail cause discoloration , thicken development crumble edge nail unsightly painful may produce serious physical occupational limitation . Onychomycosis also detrimental effect individual 's quality life , affect psychosocial emotional wellbeing . Onychomycosis difficult treat , infection recur easily . Toenail fungus affect approximately 23 million adult ( 10 % ) United States . It common among old adult tends affect men woman . Potential complication onychomycosis include pain , permanent damage nail serious infection spread beyond foot . Currently available treatment onychomycosis include oral antifungal medication ( Lamisil , Sporanox ) ; antifungal nail polish ( Penlac ) ; topical over-the-counter antifungal cream ; photodynamic therapy severe case , surgery remove nail . However , perfect cure toenail fungus . Even effective oral medication successful half time , topical medication successful less 10 % time . In addition , clearance infection growth new clear nail slow , rate recurrence infection high . Antifungal drug may also cause side effect range skin rash liver damage . Therefore , need effective lasting cure evident . Recently , research find laser therapy show promise novel alternative treatment toenail onychomycosis . Unlike medication-driven treatment , laser therapy present minimal risk side effect . Laser therapy apply toenail onychomycosis shin laser light toenail . The laser light vaporize fungus leave skin surround tissue unharmed . Low level laser light therapy operate principle photochemistry photoacceptor molecule absorb emitted photon induce biological cascade . Like eukaryotic cell , fungi contain highly complex organelle mitochondrion , responsible manufacturing energy molecule Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . Within inner mitochondrial membrane cytochrome c oxidase , identify photoacceptor molecule . It believe laser therapy could perhaps provide mean photo-destroy fungi responsible onychomycosis induce release highly reactive superoxide . Moreover , laser therapy show promote superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , process responsible destruction foreign invader . Extracellular release low level mediator associate SOD increase expression chemokines , cytokine , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule , amplify cascade elicits inflammatory response . The physiologic function hydrogen peroxide , superoxide anion , hydroxyl free radical destroy phagocytosed microbe . By enhance natural process immune system impact structural integrity fungi strain , believe laser therapy may provide mean clinician effectively treat onychomycosis without onset adverse event .</detailed_description>
