	<brief_summary>This study do see whether drug call ibrutinib give patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) maintenance therapy induction chemotherapy . This drug block enzyme affect lymphocytes grow survive . The investigator hope learn safe effective ibrutinib treat patient MCL respond induction chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib After Intensive Induction Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 2 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess toxicity . II . Determine rate conversion partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) . III . Determine median overall survival ( OS ) 4 year . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare minimal residual disease ( MRD ) result overtime polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) correlate PFS OS . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 4 year absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient preference . After completion study treatment , patient complete 4 year treatment follow 30 day . Patients complete 4 year treatment follow 4 year post-first dose treatment ( every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 4 year ) .</detailed_description>
