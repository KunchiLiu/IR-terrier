	<detailed_description>With occurrence 30 % , hyponatremia , define serum sodium concentration le 135 mmol/L , commonly encounter electrolyte disorder hospitalize patient today . The high incidence hyponatremia find elderly . Retrospective analysis clearly show association hyponatremia mortality well morbidity association confine severely decreased sodium level . Hyponatremia acute life-threatening condition , usually reflect severe sign symptom , e.g . coma seizure , often chronic nature , symptom may subtle even apparently absent due cerebral adaptation process . Signs symptom include , among others , nausea , drowsiness , cognitive impairment , memory deficit , depression , muscle cramp , gait instability . However , knowledge highly diverse clinical picture hyponatremia stem anecdotic report experiment perform investigator 1930ies . Thus , accurate thorough description symptomatology hyponatremiain disease carry far , except maybe extreme condition , i.e . patient suffer seizure coma . This especially patient chronic mild-to-moderate hyponatremia ( sometimes define sodium concentration &gt; 125 mmol/L ) may well subtle unspecific symptom often perceive asymptomatic . Recent investigation demonstrate patient significantly increase risk fall bone fracture reduce cognitive capacity . Moreover , anecdotic report show patient believe suffer depression dementia improve markedly correction concomitanthyponatremia . There also mount evidence hyponatremia induces osteoporosis add risk bone fracture . Furthermore , SALT-trials , mental component SF-12 questionnaire ( Short Form-12 ) improve significantly hyponatremia correct . Interestingly , mean sodium concentration prior treatment 129 mmol/L indicate mild moderate hyponatremia . Given high prevalence mild-to-moderate hyponatremiain elderly , unspecific symptom like mood instability , cognitive deficit others , thatare often attribute old age could simply consequence low sodium level . To end , might well treat hyponatremia morbidity/mortality population could reduce quality life improve . In light grow medico-economic challenge face secondary steadily increase life expectancy demographic evolution western world medical problem come along development influence successful correction hyponatremia mental physical health evaluate . To knowledge investigated far . The syndrome inappropriate ADH secretion ( SIADH ) account third case hyponatremia probably far frequent aetiology chronic mild moderate hyponatremia . While newly develop SIADH often induce malignancy , pulmonary cerebral disease general population , longstanding chronic hyponatremia elderly usually due idiopathic drug-associated SIADH . Apart SIADH , hypovolemia reduction effective arterial blood volume , e.g . cardiac failure liver cirrhosis , common cause hyponatremia . Although hyponatremia might impact mental physical status well patient 's prognosis regardless underlying cause , aetiology except SIADH might confound factor , since often induce `` hyponatremia-like '' clinical picture , e.g . hepatic encephalopathy liver disease etc . Another possible confounder may hemoglobin . Recent work show hyponatremia associate anaemia , highly prevalent symptom elderly patient acknowledge risk factor poor outcome population . The underlying pathogenesis association still unknown . Regarding fact anaemia hyponatremia risk factor increase morbidity mortality elderly patient potentially curable , analysis influence multidimensional geriatric assessment ( MGA ) correction challenge . To knowledge , possible confounders account exist literature . Moreover , accurate evaluation origin hyponatremia report .</detailed_description>
