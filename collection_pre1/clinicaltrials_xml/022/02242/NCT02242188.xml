	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION Exclusively breastfed infant risk iron deficiency . American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommend iron supplementation exclusively breastfed infant begin 4 month age . Uncertainty exist regard effect iron supplementation infancy neurodevelopmental outcome absence anemia . AIM To establish whether psychomotor mental development influence early iron supplementation healthy , non-anemic , exclusively predominantly breastfed infant . METHODS Healthy term newborn recruit shortly birth . If predominantly breastfed ( &gt; 50 % daily feeding ) non-anemic 4 month , randomize receive either iron supplement ( approx.1mg/kg/day ) placebo 9 month age . Participants assess use Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development ( Bayley III ) 12 , 24 36 month age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Iron nutrient essential importance human organism . It take part energy production , oxygen transportation , DNA synthesis indispensable development central nervous system . Iron required myelination production neurotransmitter . It well document iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) impair child development . If diagnosis IDA delayed , deficit may irreversible . Iron deficiency ( ID ) common single nutrient deficiency may affect 12 % child &lt; 3 year age industrialized country . ID potential negatively influence psychomotor development . However , causal relationship clear IDA . Previous study suggest iron supplementation healthy infant may enhance psychomotor development . A meta-analysis carry group ( Szajewska et al . ) aim evaluate effect iron supplementation non-anemic pregnant woman non-anemic healthy child age &lt; 3 year mental performance psychomotor development child . The author identify 7 randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , 5 refer supplementation infancy . The polled result 3 RCTs ( n = 561 ) show significant improvement Psychomotor Development Index ( PDI ) Bayley Scales Infant Development approximately 12 month age iron-supplemented group compare control group ( mean difference : 4.21 ; 95 % CI 2.31 6.12 ) . No significant effect iron supplementation Mental Developmental Index ( MDI ) behavior find . Since meta-analysis perform , one relevant new study publish . In follow-up study , cognitive school performance measure age 9 year . In original study , infant randomize receive daily supplementation iron , zinc , iron zinc placebo 4 6 month age assessment iron zinc status , well growth , perform . No statistically significant difference cognitive performance school performance report four group . Given ID common problem small child , measure prevent ID take . According Committee Nutrition European Society Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology Nutrition ( ESPGHAN CoN ) , achieve promotion exclusive breastfeeding , use iron-fortified formula formula feed need , postponement introduction whole cow milk main drink end first year life , promotion consumption complementary food rich iron . More recently , ESPGHAN CoN conclude convince evidence iron supplement provide normal birth weight , exclusively breastfed infant first 6 month life population low prevalence IDA among 6-month-olds . In contrast , American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommend iron supplementation ( 1 mg/kg ) exclusively breastfed infant begin 4 month age continue iron complementary food available . Since partially breastfed infant iron intake uncertain , receive one half daily feeding human milk , also supplement 1mg/kg iron begin 4 month . Interventional study good methodological quality evaluate role iron supplementation infant without anemia mental psychomotor development still need . MATERIALS AND METHODS This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . - Participants Healthy singleton newborn born term university hospital ( St. Anna Mazowiecka Hospital , Department Gynecology Obstetrics , The Medical University Warsaw , Poland ) consider inclusion . Their mother approach shortly birth informed consent obtain . Parents contact approximately 3 month order establish weather infant exclusively breastfed . If , infant randomise receive either iron supplement placebo age 4 complete month 9 month age . Infants also recruit well-baby clinic . Apart recruitment , study procedure pursue The Department Paediatrics , The Medical University Warsaw , Poland . - Sample size Sample size calculate main outcome fine gross motor scale , cognitive language development Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development ( Bayley III ) . In previous edition test , element assessment combine Psychomotor Developmental Index ( PDI ) Mental Developmental Index ( MDI ) . To detect difference 5 point study group power 80 % Î± =0.05 , sample 91 infant need study group . To account 20 % loss follow , aim recruit 220 infant study . - Interventions Infant experimental group receive ferric pyrophosphate ( 7mg , 10mg 15 mg depend body weight daily , i.e . approx.1 mg/kg/day ) placebo 4 month 9 month age . - Allocation concealment blind A computer-generated randomisation list prepare . Blocks ten apply . Randomisation stratify infant 's gender . Consecutive randomisation number ( number assign intervention placebo blind way ) give participant enrollment . The study product deliver centre box label letter A B ( mean A B blind , information deposit seal envelope safe administrative part department ) . The box also carry information specific dose ( 7 , 10 15mg ) . Subsequently , letter A B remove box independent person unrelated study plan conduct , replace numeric code correspond randomisation number , e.g . 001 - 7mg , 001 - 10mg , 001 - 15mg , 002 - 7mg , 002 - 10mg , 002 - 15mg etc . Sachets contain study product pack small package 30 piece . Neither collective package , sachet carry label unused sachet always return parent switch high dose . The active product placebo pack identical sachet content look taste . Researchers , caregiver , outcome assessor , person responsible statistical analysis blind intervention statistical report 12-months ' developmental assessment available . After , caregiver main outcome assessor remain blinded completion study . The information intervention assignment store seal envelope safe administrative part department .</detailed_description>
