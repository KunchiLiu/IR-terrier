	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Autonomic Nervous System , Sleep Quality , Immune Regulation Shift Nurses Practicing Alternative Nostril Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathing regulate autonomic nervous system . It well-known breathe exercise regulate autonomic nervous function promote relaxation . However , mechanism well immunity sleep quality clear . We postulate alternative nostril breathe might benefit nurse undergo shift work . The benefit could due improvement autonomic nervous function , sleep quality , even immune function . The study design include randomization two group , control group one experimental group 3 month ( 12 week ) . The control group normal breathing . The experimental group alternative nostril breathing twice week ( 20 minutes/time ) 3 month . The study primary endpoint 1 ) improve autonomic nervous function , 2 ) improve sleep quality 3 ) enhance human immunity . We anticipate reach primary endpoint publish primary result one year .</detailed_description>
