	<brief_summary>Recently , diffusion-weighted ( DW ) MR image widen application various oncologic application . Especially , expect DW MRI could provide valuable information early response evaluation treatment use rapid apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value change . It demonstrate potential usefulness response evaluation liver tumor treatments transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) radiation therapy ( RT ) . Furthermore , functional imaging technique require contrast agent , safely used patient renal insufficiency medical contraindication contrast agent . The optimal assessment early response RT could provide one important information prescribe patient cancer specific RT dose . It might also important palliative RT HCC bone metastasis relate painful aggressive mass formation . This study perform evaluate usefulness DW MRI early response evaluation RT HCC bone metastasis .</brief_summary>
