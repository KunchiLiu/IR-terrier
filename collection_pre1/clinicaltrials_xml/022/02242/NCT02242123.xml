	<detailed_description>Celiac disease ( CD ) chronic immune-mediated disorder occur genetically predispose population . Patients affected disease may asymptomatic manifest classic malabsorption symptom diarrhea , steatorrhea , abdominal pain , weight loss gluten ingestion ( related derivative find grain ) . The astute clinician must aware subtle GI picture , well non-GI sign symptom ( e.g. , iron-deficiency anemia , abnormal liver function test , type 1 diabetes mellitus ) . Diagnosis screen begin use serologic test , i.e . immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) anti-tissue transglutaminase ( tTG ) IgA anti-endomysial antibody ( EmA ) . The EmA test perform indirect immunofluorescence reagent monkey esophagus human umbilical cord . The EmA bind smooth muscle antigen tTG , test result report titer . EmA moderately sensitive highly specific ( sensitivity 85 % -98 % , specificity 97 % -100 % ) CD , quickly become negative patient start gluten-free diet . Anti-tTG highly sensitive specific test CD widely available automate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiple manufacturer . Although sensitivity specificity test high , tTG present many 5 % control patient . In addition , false-positive tTG report patient Crohn 's disease . Duodenal biopsy , still consider many criterion necessary diagnosis , demonstrate pathologic finding small intestinal villous atrophy , crypt hyperplasia , intraepithelial lymphocytosis occur exposure dietary gluten . These change exhibit improvement withdrawal gluten diet . Genetic test , reveal permissive haplotype , may helpful identify susceptible individual . CD diagnosis still anchor criterion establish European Society Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology Nutrition 1990 . These require mandatory presence ( ) villous atrophy crypt hyperplasia increase intraepithelial lymphocyte ( IELs ) count patient eat gluten , ( b ) full clinical remission elimination gluten diet . However , 20 year diagnostic criterion establish , grow evidence least two factor must consider . First , symptomatic gluten sensitivity malabsorption may coexist normal-looking mucosa . Second , find circulate IgA antibody tissue transglutaminase ( anti-tTG ) endomysium ( EmA ) diagnosis extremely accurate diagnostic instrument . As consequence , CD diagnosis nowadays also do symptomatic patient present normal-looking mucosa high titer serum EMA and/or anti-tTG antibody . However , patient minimal intestinal histology lesion pose considerable problem , serum anti-tTG EmA know often negative , weakly positive , patient CD mild intestinal damage . Picarelli et al. , 1996 , try establish whether small intestine CD patient site EmA production whether gliadin challenge could induce release . The author evaluate small intestine biopsy sample treat untreated CD patient control , culture vitro 24-48 h presence gliadin . EmA detect supernatant organ culture biopsy sample immunofluorescence technique enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , respectively . No EmA find culture supernatant biopsy sample control , whereas detect culture supernatant untreated CD patient , irrespective gliadin challenge . Conversely , EmA detect supernatant biopsy sample culture medium treated CD patient , detect majority biopsy sample challenge gliadin . The investigator , 2002 , measure anti-tTG antibody culture medium intestinal biopsy specimens patient suspected CD evaluate relationship antibody production severity intestinal mucosal damage , demonstrate anti-tTG assay culture medium biopsy specimen improve accuracy CD diagnosis patient negative serum antibody . The investigator , 2011 , evaluate diagnostic accuracy EmA assay culture medium intestinal biopsy CD diagnosis demonstrate EmA assay culture medium high sensitivity specificity serum EmA anti-tTG assay . All patient CD test false-negatives serum EmA and/or anti-tTG carried human leukocyte antigen allele associate CD . Furthermore , follow-up , subgroup patient negative-serum EmA/anti-tTG , normal villus architecture , positive-EmA culture medium , develop villous atrophy underwent gluten-free diet , consequent resolution symptom complete intestinal histology recovery . The investigator conclude EmA assay culture medium include diagnostic criterion CD diagnosis `` seronegative '' patient . The present study perform investigate clinical usefulness vitro production EmA CD diagnosis large number consecutive adult patient suspect CD weakly positive [ e.g . normal value multiply 2-3 time , 2-3xN ] serum anti-tTG .</detailed_description>
