	<brief_summary>Emergence sedation involve increase level consciousness arousal . Some insight neural core consciousness gain recent past . Our research objective characterize first time spatiotemporal mobilization ascend reticular activate system emergence sedation ; state otherwise - capture neural core arousal . To achieve objective plan utilize advanced image modality EEG-fMRI . In short , volunteer place MRI . Following baseline recording sedate continuous drip propofol , titrate deep sedation . Once sedation level , propofol administration cease emerge awake-calm/light sedation . Continuous EEG recording fMRI scan take , task specific ( auditory oddball ) resting-fMRI . Analyses focus ( restrict ) constituent ascend reticular activate system . The expected advance proposal : 1 . Emergence sedation ( anesthesia ) one critical stage least elucidated area practice anesthesia . Delayed awaken vary degree uncommon anesthesia may number different cause , individual combine , may drug non-drug related , thus cause diagnostic dilemma . Eventually - good insight subject lead well clinical practice well understanding patient emerge diverse sometimes unexpected manner . 2 . Knowledge internal structure underlie arousal anesthesia help develop / upgrade brain monitor could tell anesthesiologist patient 's level consciousness prediction arousal . 3 . A detailed reproducible mapping arousal process may serve core drug screen platform drug may expedite patient arousal . 4 . Elucidation arousal paradigm sedation enhance knowledge physiological sleep . Research hypothesis Return consciousness complex phenomenon comprise interplay cortex deeper brain structure . We hypothesize activation signature conserve similar subject . Furthermore , hypothesize inter-subject variability arise mainly time domain , evident clinical observation variable time emergence different patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arousal Pathways Emergence From Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedation general anesthesia hub modern medicine . The practice administration anesthesia sedation evolve considerably consider safe reproducible . Still , one critical part anesthesia practice emergence : phenomenological variability clinical presentation emergence , increase inherent risk airway patency , insufficient respiratory mechanic , hyperreflexia alter mental state . Our understand underlying mechanisms sedation anesthesia still somewhat lacking : The body evidence concern induction maintenance evolve [ 1-4 ] , whereas profound gap knowledge concern emergence . While anesthetic agent exert global effect brain , clear focus sensitive [ 5 ] relevant achievement anesthetic goal hypnosis , amnesia , reduce responsiveness . Mechanisms unconsciousness induce general anesthesia [ 1 ] broadly dissect two element : consciousness arousal : Current consciousness theory [ 6,7 ] ascribe consciousness ability experience . To achieve goal , information complexity information integration paramount . These faculty reside mainly neocortex . Arousal hand , reside mainly thalamus , hypothalamus , midbrain pons neural machinery physiological sleep [ 8,9 ] . We tend associate consciousness arousability . Dreaming however - straightforward example consciousness without arousal . A give level arousal output balance mutual inhibition sleep promote locus - ventrolateral preoptic nucleus - multiple arousal locus , commonly know ARAS ( Ascending Reticular Activating System ) [ 10,11 ] . Shortly , disperse system comprise multiple nuclei different neurotransmitter . Some nuclei thalamic projection extra-thalamic direct diverse cortical projection . The transition sleep wakefulness enhance Orexigenic neuron hypothalamus [ 12,13 ] , serve flip flop mechanism . The research consciousness make progress [ 14 ] use anesthetic approach specifically , emergence sedation anesthesia , describe neural core consciousness . Recently , publication Purdon et al . [ 15,16 ] identify EEG signature consciousness transition state . The body evidence concern arousal pathway less formidable , possibly due disperse array nucleus , `` deep '' subcortical location , complicate evaluation less invasive method ( scalp EEG ) . The classic research tool field lesion study ( animal model unfortunate patient ) [ 17,18 ] discrete locus observe change sleep-wake physiology . Recently , pioneer ex vivo ( rat pup midbrain slice ) research Garcia-rill Charlesworth [ 19 ] , use intracellular recording provide compel data support electrical couple coherence neuron within nuclei ARAS . However , best knowledge date explicit trial capture characterize dynamic change ARAS human subject emerge sedation . Research objectives 1 . To characterize spatiotemporal signature sequence arouse brain , focus ( restrict ) deep brain structure . Arousal signature may include follow : - A conserved sequence brain structure mobilization . - Summation focus activation ( without explicit order ) . - Hierarchy different locus ( cholinergic vs. monoaminic component ARAS ) . 2 . To identify reproducible signal heralding imminent return consciousness . Methods : The propose study submit Institutional Review Board committee approval . Experiment summary : The propose study interventional , single center study , conduct 20 volunteer . A sample size 20 chosen light relatively low signal noise ratio inherent fMRI imaging . subject healthy male age 20-40 , take chronic medication use illicit drug . All subject , sign informed consent form , fill standard MRI questionnaire detection metallic implant undergo medical evaluation examination anesthesiologist . During study period volunteer monitor non invasive standard patient ASA monitoring : ECG , blood pressure , pulse oximetry , exhale CO2 level . Each subject connect EEG record cap , place magnet . Baseline recording EEG , MRI fMRI take . Then sedation induce continuous IV propofol infusion Target Controlled Infusion pump - TCI , use Marsh model [ 14,20,21 ] . Depth sedation titrate deep sedation ( Ramsay scale 5 ) [ 22 ] . Subsequently , propofol administration discontinue , continuous EEG fMRI recording take emerge sedation awake calm/light sedation ( Ramsay 2-3 ) , verify response subject 's give name . At point EEG monitoring fMRI scan cease . The subject help magnet transfer post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . All subject monitor reach discharge criterion ascertain examination perform anesthesiologist . Brain monitoring 1 . Functional Magnetic Resonance ( fMRI ) : brain BOLD fMRI - blood oxygen level dependent fMRI - harness magnetic property ferric ion hemoglobin image change blood flow metabolically active brain locus . The underlying assumption image modality ( similar Positron Emission Tomography ) metabolic couple cellular activity blood flow . Analyses focus restrict subthalamic structure involve RAS . 2 . EEG ( electroencephalogram ) , MRI - EEG-fMRI . Combining superior temporal resolution EEG localize resolution MRI . The EEG serve adjunct level sedation source data concern thalamocortical pathway arousal . Expected result : The result research project may help improve patient safety prediction his/her arousal status . Anesthesia/Arousal level monitor yet prove contribution patient safety . Integration deep brain structure data may prove miss link improve monitor ' performance . Additionally , thorough understanding arousal process potentially help develop agent hasten arousal , may serve screen paradigm know pharmaceutical ( expand clinical indication ) well new chemical entity ( NCEs ) . Feasibility perceive strength : The feasibility propose research project high . The project perform Tel Aviv Medical Center Wohl Center Advanced Imaging . The Wohl Center involve prominent neuroscience research group significant number publication related emotional cognitive processing health disease . Some study include volunteer [ 23,24 ] use fMRI EEG follow propofol induce sedation [ 25,26 ] . The propose project enjoy full collaboration research center . In light , completion propose imaging session subsequent analysis realistic . A thorough characterization emergence process warrant careful , dedicated attention deep brain structure design experiment throughout execution analysis . As stand-alone scalp EEG record fall short find `` emergence fingerprint '' ( EEG signal represent mostly cortical activity ) contest combine EEG-fMRI carry hop characterization emergence sedation .</detailed_description>
