	<detailed_description>Abstract : While head neck cancer ( HNC ) highly curable , primary radiation treatment ( RT ) nonetheless challenge . Despite intensive , high-quality , multidisciplinary symptom management HNC patient RT , 80 % patient experience moderate severe level oral mucositis make nearly impossible drink sufficient fluid necessitate opioid care pain . Our data show 27 - 32 % HNC patient admit inpatient emergency room ( ER ) unit RT . Those admission relate dehydration ( accompany cost ) largely preventable , provide at-risk patient identify early intravenous fluid rehydration . Currently , give standard care HNC patient undergo RT , clinicians assess patient per week standard clinic visit . However , physiological change underlie onset dehydration develop rapidly , often clinic visit . In proposed project , focus miss opportunity prevention test efficacy novel method home-based dehydration assessment early intervention reduce dehydration risk . This project assess efficacy coordinate dehydration prevention program use system ( CYCORE ) link home-based monitoring sensor -- collect biometric self-reported symptom data -- cyber-infrastructure ( CI ) send data daily patient 's healthcare team , turn monitor patient early sign dehydration provide early clinical intervention , need . The project base successful pilot study evaluate feasibility CYCORE use HNC patient radiology healthcare team . The patient report high acceptability system , clinicians perceive data valuable useful provide additional information regard patient 's at-home dehydration status . We randomize total 192 HNC patient receive RT MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) either standard care CYCORE + standard care ( CYCORE ) . We hypothesize patient randomize CYCORE experience few hospitalization ER admission ( few associate cost ) due dehydration compare patient standard care arm . To best knowledge , application system CYCORE explore HNC population . Objective , home-based monitoring may optimal method capture data critical early evaluation dehydration risk ; method , patient self-report , limited patient 's ability accurately recall symptom . MDACC ideal environment conduct propose study ; HNC patient treat RT MDACC compare center Texas , possible track outcomes cost-related data , give HNC patient receive RT-related care , include related hospitalization ER admission , one center . If efficacy study prove successful , dehydration prevention model potentially applied health condition setting .</detailed_description>
