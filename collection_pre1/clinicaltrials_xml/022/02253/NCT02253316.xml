	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate treatment regimen call IRD give participant stem cell transplant effort help prolong amount time participant disease-free transplant . IRD three-drug regimen consist ixazomib , lenalidomide ( also call Revlimid ) , dexamethasone . After 4 cycle IRD , participant randomize receive maintenance therapy either ixazomib lenalidomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study IRD ( Ixazomib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone ) Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Followed Maintenance Ixazomib Lenalidomide Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based need improve progression-free survival overall survival post-autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) multiple myeloma benefit see consolidation/maintenance treatment immunomodulatory drug thalidomide lenalidomide proteasome inhibitor bortezomib , natural next step evaluate combination regimens immunomodulatory drug proteasome inhibitor consolidation/maintenance post-ASCT . The regimen consist ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( IRD ) show low toxicity , availability oral formulation ixazomib allow easy administration compare bortezomib . In study , follow consolidation IRD , patient randomize maintenance therapy lenalidomide ixazomib order collect pilot data compare toxicity efficacy maintenance therapy immunomodulatory drug proteasome inhibitor .</detailed_description>
