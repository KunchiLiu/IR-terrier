	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disorder affect central nervous system characterize pathologically focal demyelinate lesion brain parenchyma . Meningeal inflammation MS first note 2004 . Ectopic lymphoid follicle describe meninges patient secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) think correlate cortical lesion atrophy ( surrogate marker disability ) . Subsequently , inflammation meninges describe primary progressive MS ( PPMS ) well early relapse MS . The ectopic lymphoid follicle compose B-cells , T follicular helper cell follicular dendritic cell . Rituximab monoclonal antibody CD-20 ( B-cell marker ) FDA approve treatment various lymphoma . It show effective give intravenously trial RRMS . However , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) penetrance rituximab minimal , CSF level &lt; 1 % serum level administration intravenous ( IV ) rituximab . Indeed , IV rituximab fail significantly slow disability clinical trial progressive MS. Intrathecal ( IT ) rituximab administration use CNS lymphoma achieve great CSF concentration rituximab . In MS , IT administration rituximab could lead high CSF rituximab level result disruption meningeal ectopic lymphoid follicle , ultimately reduce cortical lesion possibly disease progression . A recently describe finding presence enhance meningeal lesion post-contrast FLAIR image MS patient . These could possibly represent ectopic lymphoid follicle . This finding could serve biomarker identify patient ectopic meningeal lymphoid follicle might likely derive benefit IT rituximab therapy . We hypothesize IT rituximab therapy patient progressive form MS could disrupt ectopic lymphoid follicle meninges thus slow progression disease , particularly important exist FDA-approved therapy progressive MS. We hypothesize use post-contrast FLAIR image identify enhance meningeal lesion provide biomarker select patient might likely respond IT rituximab use lesion monitor therapeutic response . The primary aim study assess safety intrathecal administration rituximab patient progressive MS . The secondary aim evaluate IT rituximab lead decrease quantity meningeal lesion post-contrast FLAIR imaging change biomarkers inflammatory activity neuronal injury CSF . Progressive MS currently FDA approve treatment . There great need new therapeutic modality patient progressive form MS . The identification novel treatment progressive MS would beneficial impact ten thousand patient progressive MS .</detailed_description>
