	<brief_title>Innovative MRI Techniques Improve Treatment Stratification Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The outcome esophageal cancer poor , overall 5-year survival rate 10 % worldwide . In resectable esophageal cancer , outcome improved multimodality treatment . The current standard treatment resectable esophageal cancer consist neoadjuvant chemoradiation follow resection . In Netherlands , preferred chemoradiation regimen consist carboplatin plus paclitaxel concurrent radiotherapy 23 fraction 1.8 Gray.1 In meta-analysis benefit chemoradiation surgery alone adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma shown.2 However , patient benefit preoperative treatment regimen . Some patient develop recurrent disease despite chemoradiation additional ( systemic ) treatment might indicate . In contrast , patient ( nearly ) complete response observe chemoradiation patient could possibly treat less extensive treatment regimen . Furthermore , patient without threatened circumferential resection margin ( CRM ) lymph node metastasis chemoradiotherapy could possibly omit , reduce patient ' risk complication unnecessary , expensive treatment . Thus , stratification patient esophageal cancer urgently need . Functional magnetic resonance image technique ( MRI ) provide vivo , quantitative information tumor biology may prove useful non-invasive tool purpose . In project , ultra-small superparamagnetic particle iron oxide ( USPIO ) enhance MRI use ferumoxytol ( Rienso® ) , diffusion weight MRI ( DWI ) T2* MRI develop , term improvement acquisition data processing technique . For patient esophageal cancer , propose acquisition technique data processing perform . Objectives study 1 . To determine optimal acquisition technique USPIO enhance MRI DWI T2* MRI esophageal cancer term signal-to-noise ratio , time resolution spatial resolution . 2 . To determine optimal data process approach USPIO enhance MRI , DWI T2* MRI esophageal cancer . 3 . To explore correlation lymph node involvement USPIO enhance MRI relation result obtain pathological examination . 4 . To explore correlation DWI T2* MRI esophageal cancer relation stromal involvement marker hypoxia vasculature obtain pathological examination . 5 . To explore accuracy MRI concern circumferential tumor delineation compare pathological examination . 6 . To determine feasibility detect lymph node involvement USPIO enhance MRI initial staging , prior preoperative chemoradiation therapy . 7 . To determine correlation lymph node involvement pre-treatment USPIO MRI relation result obtain pathology complete treatment . The project execute four step : 1 . Optimization acquisition data processing technique USPIO MRI , DWI T2* five healthy volunteer optimize field view , number slice , slice thickness ( objectives 1 2 ) . 2 . Assessment ferumoxytol dose-response three different dose level three different time point six healthy volunteer ( two per dose-level ) ( objectives 1 2 ) . 3 . Using data ( 1 ) ( 2 ) : assessment USPIO MRI , DWI T2* MRI 20 esophageal cancer patient clinically suspect lymph node directly surgery ( objective 3 , 4 5 ) . 4 . Using data ( 1 ) ( 2 ) : assessment USPIO MRI , DWI T2* MRI 10 esophageal cancer patient clinically suspect lymph node , initial start treatment ( objectives 6 7 ) . For step 1 2 aim include healthy volunteer ; step 3 4 aim include patient esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
