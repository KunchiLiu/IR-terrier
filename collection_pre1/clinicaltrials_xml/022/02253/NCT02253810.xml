	<brief_title>Efficacy Tranexamic Acid Reducing Blood Loss Blood Transfusion After Periacetabular Osteotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) elective reorientation surgery hip joint , typically treatment hip dysplasia young , otherwise healthy patient , require multiple pelvic osteotomy around acetabulum . A major source perioperative morbidity blood loss . The principal cause postoperative blood loss PAO surgical trauma , secondary activation coagulation cascade local fibrinolysis . In PAO literature , allogeneic transfusion rate high 58 % , blood loss range nearly 4 L. The risk excessive blood loss blood transfusion young , healthy patient elective surgery event reduce blood conservation protocol , include pharmacological agent . Tranexamic acid synthetic derivative amino acid lysine competitive inhibitor plasminogen activation interfere fibrinolysis . Multiple study meta-analyses show intravenous administration antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid reduces postoperative bleed need transfusion joint replacement surgery . However , publish data exists support use PAO . We hypothesize intravenous tranexamic acid reduce perioperative blood loss , thus , transfusion requirement patient undergoing PAO . A total 80 patient enrol . Patients randomize receive either intravenous tranexamic acid versus placebo ( normal saline ) PAO . Calculated total blood loss ( primary outcome ) determine , intraoperative cell saver utilization ( secondary outcome ) , ( 3 ) postoperative allogeneic blood transfusion ( secondary outcome ) record . Patients follow total 6 week surgical intervention . If use IV tranexamic acid PAO patient population significantly reduce total perioperative blood loss , would provide efficacious inexpensive method reduce postoperative morbidity PAO .</detailed_description>
