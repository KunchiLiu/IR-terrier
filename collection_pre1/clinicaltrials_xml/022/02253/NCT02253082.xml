	<detailed_description>Trial Name : VIPER-OCTA trial - Vasculopathic Injury Plasma Endothelial Rescue - OCTAplas trial Background - Patients operate thoracic aortic dissection deep hypothermic circulatory arrest prone develop postoperative renal failure secondary severe endothelial dysfunction capillary leakage , currently therapy address complication proven successful - Data animal model shock massively bleed patient indicate plasma may beneficial re-establishing endothelial integrity - Patients operate thoracic aortic dissection generally develop requirement massive transfusion surgery - Current guideline , however , recommend plasma transfusion patient need coagulation factor replacement due inherent risk transfusion complication - OctaplasLG® immune complex-free cell-free , pathogen inactivate standardized plasma product show related transfusion complication see secondary standard fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , thus , OctaplasLG® may beneficial , alternative resuscitation fluid patient severe endothelial dysfunction/damage - The purpose bridge knowledge gap regard effect OctaplasLG® endothelial integrity safety Design Single-centre randomise , single-blinded , control , investigator-initiated pilot trial 42 patient undergoing emergency surgery thoracic aortic dissection randomize administration OctaplasLG® , compare standard FFP , coagulation factor replacement relate bleeding , need coagulation factor replacement deem necessary clinician accord local protocol . Inclusion criterion - Patient eligible emergency surgery cardiopulmonary bypass pump thoracic aortic dissection AND - Age &gt; 18 year AND - Consent obtainable patient proxy ( independent physician and/or next kin ) Exclusion criterion - Documented refusal blood transfusion OR - FFP transfusion randomization OR - Aortic dissection due trauma OR - Treatment GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor &lt; 24h screening OR - Withdrawal active therapy OR - Expected die &lt; 24h OR - Previously within 30 day include randomized trial , know time enrolment . - Known immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency document antibody IgA - Known hypersensitivity OctaplasLG® : active substance , excipients ( Sodium citrate dihydrate , Sodium dihydrogenphosphate dihydrate Glycine ) residues manufacture process ( Tri ( N-Butyl ) Phosphate ( TNBP ) Octoxynol ( Triton X-100 ) ) - Known severe deficiency protein S - Pregnancy ( non-pregnancy confirm patient postmenopausal negative serum-hCG ) . Randomization Blood Bank staff perform 24 hour on-site randomisation envelope-opening allow immediate allocation either receive OctaplasLG® ( intervention ) standard FFP ( control ) coagulation factor replacement . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure : • Plasma level endothelial marker ( Syndecan-1 , soluble thrombomodulin ( sTM ) , sE-selectin , sVE-cadherin ) 24 hour arrival ICU postoperative care , compare baseline Secondary outcome measure : - Plasma level endothelial marker ( Syndecan-1 , sTM , sE-selectin , sVE-cadherin ) 48 hour postoperatively , compare baseline - Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) accord RIFLE Criteria first 7 postoperative day , see appendix 1 - Renal replacement therapy - Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) , bad score ICU stay , see appendix 2 - 30-day 90-day mortality - P-CRP , IL-6 , P-Catecholamines 24 hour 48 hour - Length stay ICU hospital - Severe adverse reaction Tertiary outcome measure - TRALI - TACO Trial size The calculation base part data collect quality control investigation effect OctaplasLG® vs. FFP . The power calculation base find significantly higher relative level sTM FFP compare OctaplasLG® group ( p=0.025 ) . The relative value sTM post-CPB : FFP group : mean 3.35 ( SD 2.12 ) ; OctaplasLG® group : mean 1.70 ( SD 0.49 ) ; SD across entire group patient : 1.574 . To detect difference power 0.90 ( 1-β ) alpha 0.05 require n=21 patient group . The investigator choose include 42 patient , 21 evaluable patient randomization group case attrition , present trial .</detailed_description>
