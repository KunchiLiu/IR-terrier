	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common malignance see different region world . Surgical resection provide best chance cure select patient . However , long perplexed high rate tumor recurrence , often main cause long-term treatment failure . The 5-year risk recurrence HCC resection report high 70 % . It propose best way reduce recurrence search improve adjuvant therapy . Especially postoperative patient identify risk factor recurrence , several adjuvant therapy often use , include TACE . However , safy efficacy preventive therapy still clear . Recently , variety Traditional Chinese Medicine combine TACE toxicity reduction enhance efficacy investigate treatment HCC . Cidan capsule formula contain ten type plant extract , include Rhizoma Curcumae ( 19 % ) , Astragalus ( 19.6 % ) , Cremastra appendiculata ( 9.8 % ) , Salvia miltiorrhiza ( 9.8 % ) , hive ( 9.8 % ) Bombyx batryticatus ( 9.8 % ) . Cidan clinically use &gt; 10 year safe nontoxic antitumor drug . A number study investigate clinical application TCMs HCC , demonstrate β‑elemene , present Rhizoma Curcumae main component cidan , may inhibit proliferation HepG2 cell time‑ dose‑dependent manner . The result indicate β‑elemene exhibit positive effect apoptosis induce cell cycle arrest HepG2 cell G2/M phase , Fas Fas ligand expression level markedly increase . In prospective control study , enroll HCC patient experience operation identifed high risk recurrence . After preventive TACE , eligible patient divide two group . One group accept Cidan therapy another . Under basis large sample , safty efficacy Cidan combine TACE HCC patient investigate analysed .</detailed_description>
