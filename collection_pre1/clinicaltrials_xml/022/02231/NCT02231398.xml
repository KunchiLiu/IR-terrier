	<detailed_description>The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) , collaboration Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Child Health Human Development , fund follow-up study nuMoM2b cohort evaluate association adverse pregnancy outcome ( APOs ) cardiovascular health approximately 2 3½ year postpartum . The study , call nuMoM2b Heart Health Study nuMoM2b HHS , utilizes extensive database tissue bank develop nuMoM2b nulliparous woman evaluate course pregnancy study mechanism prediction APOs . Women enrol nuMoM2b cohort extremely well phenotyped prospective data collection , clinical evaluation , ultrasound assessment , well use standardized definition . Demographic , psychosocial , dietary , physiologic , outcome information collect maternal interview , self-administered questionnaire , clinical measurement , ultrasound , medical record abstraction . Samples maternal blood , urine , cervico-vaginal fluid pregnancy cord blood placenta delivery collect bank . All woman complete two sleep questionnaire 3,600 objective overnight sleep study two time pregnancy . Women participate nuMoM2b assess nuMoM2b HHS evidence cardiovascular disease risk ( CVDR ) , include sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) , 2 3½ year postpartum . APOs subsequent pregnancy also assess . This study characterize relationship APOs CVDR , identify first pregnancy profile portend subsequent CVDR , determine association SDB first pregnancy subsequent CVDR , identify modifiable factor mediate association CVDR APOs first subsequent pregnancy . This follow-up study allow development strategy modify CVDR factor improve health woman suffer APOs . The nuMoM2b Heart Health Study prospective observational study include interval contact detail cardiovascular assessment 2 3½ year delivery index pregnancy . At cardiovascular assessment , potentially eligible woman invite attend cardiovascular screen visit . After informed consent , urine pregnancy test perform confirm eligibility . The visit include clinical laboratory measurement well structure interview ass domain measure nuMoM2b pregnancy : physical activity , depression , social support , psychological stress , nutritional status . Women sleep breathe assessment nuMoM2b pregnancy offer another overnight sleep study . The overarch goal well define relation outcome pregnancy long term health mother . The specific aim follow : Aim 1 : Define incidence hypertension cardiovascular disease risk ( CVDR ) profile woman approximately 2 3½ year first pregnancy complicate preeclampsia adverse pregnancy outcome ( APOs : stillbirth , small gestational age birth [ SGA ] , preterm birth , preeclampsia , pregnancy-associated hypertension , gestational diabetes [ GDM ] ) compare woman APOs first pregnancy . Aim 2 : Identify profile early pregnancy portend subsequent CVDR approximately 2 3½ year postpartum . Aim 3 : Determine whether pregnancy postpartum sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) associate increased CVDR identify specific pattern pregnancy postpartum SDB increase CVDR . Aim 4 : Identify modifiable factor pregnancy mediate association APOs CVDR pregnancy approximately 2 3½ year postpartum .</detailed_description>
