	<detailed_description>Objective : To establish effective repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) protocol stimulate circuit relevant addiction . Specifically , develop stimulation parameter outcome measure rTMS anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) specialize TMS coil : HAC coil ( Brainsway Ltd. ) . Various parameter rTMS stimulation ( frequency intensity ) vary , sensitivity behavioral task MRI measure stimulation determine . The objective protocol therefore allow development , assessment refinement rTMS parameter stimulate ACC target . In addition , outcome measure develop capture effect stimulation . Results development protocol apply subsequent cognitive imaging protocol . Study population : Up 50 healthy , non-smoking adult test several condition two week . Subjects must fit exclusion/inclusion criterion TMS MRI . We expect 140 subject enrol arrive number 50 complete protocol . Design : Within-subject design subject complete 10 rTMS session . Outcome measure : In first phase , outcome measure behavioral response task relies ACC . In second phase , outcome measure effect MR measure . These include task-related blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) responses , well rest state BOLD fMRI . Other MR measure , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) , also explore potential biomarkers .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must : 1 . Be able give valid inform consent 2 . Be 18 55 year age . 1 . Justification : Many neural process change age , change could introduce unwanted variability behavioral MRI signal . In addition , risk difficulttodetect medical abnormality silent cerebral infarct increase age . 2 . Screening tool : History . Governmentissued form identification ( e.g . driver license , birth certificate ) require participant appear age range . 3 . Be good health . 1 . Justification : Many illness may alter neural function well fMRI signal . 2 . Screening tool : Medical Assessment , Medical History Physical Examination . Medical assessment include : Vital Signs , EKG , oral HIV test , height/weight measurement , urinalysis blood sample . Tests blood sample include CBC , complete metabolic profile , TSH , ESR , STS HIV ( need confirm positive salivary test HIV ) . The follow individual laboratory result independently disqualify individual : Cholesterol &gt; 250 mg/dl , Hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dl , WBC &lt; 2400/microl , LFTs &gt; 3Xnormal , HCG positive , Casual serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl , Urine protein &gt; 1+ . The MAI retain discretion exclude less extreme value , depend clinical presentation . ( Serum glucose 140 mg/dl follow fast serum glucose assessment . Those fast glucose 100 mg/dl may consider protocol . Others reject referred workup . ) MAI make final judgment questionable lab result . 4 . Righthanded . 1 . Justification : Using righthanded individual reduce variability BOLD MRI data . 2 . Screening tool : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . 5 . Estimated IQ great equal 85 1 .
