	<brief_summary>Background : - WHIMS ( Warts , Hypogammaglobulinemia , Infections , Myelokathexis Syndrome ) rare disease . It cause cancer , infection , wart . Researchers want see drug call plerixafor treat WHIMS . Objective : - To compare plerixafor versus granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) prevent infection people WHIMS . Eligibility : - People age 10 75 WHIMS CXCR4 gene mutation . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They may heart spleen test body scan . They may sample skin wart take . Researchers may take photograph wart . - Participants start twice daily self-injections G-CSF . Their doctor decide dosage . - Initial Period ( 4 12 week ) - Participants : - continue injection usual antibiotic and/or immunoglobulin - blood drawn - keep daily health diary - Participants visit clinic 2 day without injection . - Adjustment Period 1 ( 8 week ) : - Participants : - continue twice daily injection home - continue daily health diary - blood test every 2 week . - Treatment Year 1 : - Participants - receive either plerixafor G-CSF injection twice daily - continue health diary - blood test every 2 month - visit clinic every 4 month - At end year 1 , participant visit clinic evaluation . They switch study drug . They 8-week adjustment 1-year treatment period . - At end year 2 , participant visit clinic complete injection go back previous G-CSF regimen . Participants continue daily health diary blood test 5 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plerixafor Versus G-CSF Treatment People With WHIM Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Warts , hypogammaglobulinemia , infection , myelokathexis syndrome ( WHIMS ) rare combine primary immunodeficiency disorder cause gain-of-function mutation gene chemokine receptor CXCR4 . Normally , CXCR4 express leukocyte subset function part promote hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) neutrophil home retention bone marrow . WHIM mutation alter CXCR4 carboxyl terminus , enhance prolongs receptor signal . As result , egress normally produce functional neutrophil bone marrow blood impair cause neutropenia , bone marrow pathologic find referred myelokathexis . A similar mechanism may also affect leukocyte subset since WHIM patient usually panleukopenic . Consequently , WHIM patient predispose frequent acute bacterial infection , especially sinopulmonary tract , may cause chronic morbidity , respiratory insufficiency case premature death . WHIM patient also mark difficulty clear infection Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) , result persistent cutaneous anogenital wart several report case evolve cancer . Several death also occur due cancer associate Epstein -Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . Therapies currently use WHIMS non-specific expensive , include Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) ( drug currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat severe congenital neutropenia ) , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) , prophylactic antibiotic . None measure formally evaluate efficacy WHIM syndrome ( WHIMS ) ; however , clinical experience base treatment 24 WHIM patient see National Institutes Health ( NIH ) since 2006 , recurrent bacterial infection continue occur , despite fact absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) readily maintain 500 cells/microliter G-CSF IgG level restore normal range IVIg . Thus , continue major unmet medical need effective therapy WHIMS despite availability application best therapy neutropenia hypogammaglobulinemia patient . Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) specific small molecule antagonist CXCR4 , license FDA HSC mobilization transplantation cancer , therefore logical candidate molecularly target treatment WHIMS . The goal treatment would reduce CXCR4 signal normal , zero , thus , absent off-target effect , target chronic treatment agent may safe . In regard , 2 recent short term Phase I dose-escalation study plerixafor , one group , total 9 patient demonstrated drug could safely mobilize neutrophil , also leukocyte subset decrease blood WHIM patient . A follow-up Phase I study , conduct group , 3 patient give plerixafor 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/d 6 month demonstrate hematopoietic effect durable . Moreover , frequency infection reduce plerixafor compare retrospective data mine three year start therapy prospective data collect one year end therapy , even though 2 patient take GCSF comparison time period . No new wart occur treatment several exist wart improve resolve . Although result encourage , small number patient study , limited duration drug treatment , retrospective mining control data leave open question whether plerixafor truly efficacious clinical outcome WHIMS . The randomized , double blind , crossover trial described design answer question establish long-term safety clinical efficacy ( primary endpoint : infection severity ; multiple secondary endpoint include wart control ) plerixafor compare G-CSF treatment WHIMS patient 10-75 year age . G-CSF comparator require approve use patient severe congenital neutropenia ( SCN ) . Brief outline study intend randomize 20 patient treat double-blinded manner 1 year G-CSF 1 year plerixafor use crossover design allow direct comparison infection severity treatment agent , dos determine patient individual neutrophil response . A schedule event provide Appendix A . Data analyze specified Statistics section ( Section 14 ) randomization . Tolerability patient drug preference also assess .</detailed_description>
