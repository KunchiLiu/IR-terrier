	<brief_title>Effectiveness Prolift+M Versus Conventional Vaginal Prolapse Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Pelvic organ prolapse highly prevalent female population . The incidence pelvic organ prolapse increase age , long life expectancy woman may cause pelvic organ prolapse become even major health issue . The recurrence rate pelvic organ prolapse surgical treatment high . The recurrence rate anterior vaginal wall prolapse anterior colporrhaphy 30 % -45 % . The posterior vaginal wall prolapse recurrence rate posterior colporrhaphy 12-25 % . This emphasize clinical need improvement surgical technique currently use . Placement mesh aim reduce recurrence rate ( 2-11 % ) . Objective : To compare clinical cost effectiveness Tension free Vaginal Mesh + Monocryl ( Prolift+M ) standard vaginal prolapse surgery ( i.e . fascial placation ) . A secondary objective track post-operative long-term complication procedure . A third objective evaluate recovery surgery . Study design : prospective , multicentre , randomize , non-blinded study Tension free Vaginal Mesh + Monocryl ( Prolift+MTM ) standard vaginal prolapse surgery ( i.e . fascial placation ) . Study population : woman primary pelvic organ prolapse anterior and/or posterior compartment POP stage II , age 45 year old . Intervention ( applicable ) : Prolapse surgery tension free vaginal mesh + Monocryl ( Prolift + M ) versus conventional vaginal prolapse surgery . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main outcome percentage patient objective anatomical success ( POP stage &lt; 2 ) 24 month . As secondary outcome subjective improvement quality life measure generic ( EQ-5D , PGI-I ) disease-specific ( UDI , DDI , IIQ PFDI20 ) quality life instrument . Sexual functioning measure generic ( FSFI ) disease specific ( PISQ12 ) questionnaires . Complications monitor special notice pain ( Mc Gill pain questionnaire ) Recovery measure Recovery index 10 . The economical endpoint short term ( 2 year ) incremental cost-effectiveness term cost per additional year free prolapse cost per QALY gain . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Burden associate participation : complete disease specific Quality life questionnaire 4 time , complete recovery index questionnaire 3 time . Visit hospital 4 time surgery ( 2 time often patient participate study ) . Since subject select subject already agree complete surgical procedure , additional risk participation study low . These risk include tissue erosion ( vaginal , rectal bladder ) , vaginal pain/dyspareunia .</detailed_description>
