	<brief_summary>There emerge research detail relationship balance/gait/falls cognition . Imaging study also suggest link structural functional change frontal lobe ( region commonly associate cognitive function ) mobility . People Parkinson 's disease important change cognitive function may impact rehabilitation efficacy . Our underlying hypothesis cognitive function frontal lobe connection basal ganglia brainstem posture/locomotor center responsible postural deficit people Parkinson 's disease play role rehabilitation efficacy . The purpose study 1 ) determine people Parkinson 's disease improve mobility and/or cognition partake cognitively challenge mobility exercise program 2 ) determine cognition brain circuitry deficit predict responsiveness exercise rehabilitation . Design : This study randomize cross-over control intervention take place University Balance Disorders Laboratory . The study participant people Parkinson 's disease meet inclusion criterion study . The intervention 6 week group exercise ( case ) 6 week group education ( control ) . The exercise cognitively challenge program base Agility Boot Camp people PD . The education program 6-week program teach people well live chronic disease . The primary outcome measure MiniBESTest secondary outcome measure mobility , cognition neural imaging . Discussion : The result study understanding relationship cognition mobility focus brain circuitry relate rehabilitation potential .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Aged 5090 year old . No musculoskeletal peripheral central nervous system disorder ( idiopathic Parkinson disease ( iPD ) parkinsonism ) could significantly affect balance gait . Capable following direction . iPD subject : UK Brain Bank criterion , i.e. , bradykinesia least one following : rest tremor , muscular rigidity , postural instability cause visual , vestibular , cerebellar proprioceptive dysfunction . Unilateral onset , response levodopa . Parkinsonism subject : Gait characterize slow short step , shuffle gait may widebased , FoG , postural instability . Exclusion criterion : Inability stand walk 2 min without assistive device Recent change medication Excessive use alcohol recreational drug , Contraindications MRI scan ( eg , claustrophobia , metal body ) Intervention subject exclude : 1 ) participate vigorous exercise program 2 x/week , 2 ) A medical condition contraindicates exercise participation . Parkinsonism subject : iPD Parkinson plus syndrome Progressive Supranuclear Palsy , Multiple System Atrophy , Corticobasal Syndrome , Cerebellar Ataxia . Idiopathic PD subject : Same deep brain stimulation electrode . Significant tremor would interfere withMRI scan . Control subject : Will match age gender iPD parkinsonism group .</criteria>
