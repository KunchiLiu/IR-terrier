	<brief_summary>Background : - Ebola virus cause infection know Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . This generally severe disease also lead death . The 2014 outbreak EVD West Africa large ever . Researchers want develop vaccine prevent Ebola infection . It impossible someone get Ebola infection vaccine . Objectives : - To see Ebola vaccine safe study immune response . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18-65 . Design : - Participants screen separate protocol . - Participants receive vaccine injection needle syringe upper arm muscle . - Participants stay clinic 3 hour injection . - About 2 day later , participant must speak clinic staff . - Every day 7 day injection , participant record temperature symptom look injection site . They get thermometer ruler measure redness swell . They report side effect . - In first 2 month study , participant least 6 clinic visit 1 phone call . They least 3 visit next 9 month . - At visit , participant check health change problem since last visit . They ask feel take medicine . Blood drawn visit . Urine sample may collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase 1/1b , open-label study examine safety , tolerability immunogenicity investigational Ebola vaccine healthy adult . Part 1 Phase 1 dose escalation cAd3-EBO vaccine encode wild type ( WT ) glycoprotein ( GP ) Zaire Sudan strain Ebolavirus . Part 2 Phase 1b evaluation cAd3-EBO vaccine high dose evaluation Zaire component , provide vaccine designate cAd3-EBOZ . The hypothesis study vaccine , cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ , safe elicit immune response Ebola GP . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability study vaccine administer single intramuscular ( IM ) injection two dose level . The secondary objective related evaluation immunogenicity . Product Description : VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP ( cAd3-EBO ) compose two recombinant cAd3 vector 1:1 ratio express Ebola WT GPs Zaire Sudan strain . It formulate 2 time 10 ( 11 ) PU/mL . VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP ( cAd3-EBOZ ) compose cAd3 vector express Ebola WT GP Zaire strain . It formulate 1 time 10 ( 11 ) PU/mL . VRC-DILADC065-00-VP ( diluent ) formulation buffer use vaccine production use need prepare correct dosage cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ . Subjects : Part 1 : Healthy adult volunteer , 18 50 year old ; Part 2 : Healthy adult volunteer , 18 65 year old . Study Plan : Part 1 : 20 subject enrol , 10 two dosage group cAd3-EBO . The dose escalation plan include daily review new safety data study clinician , weekly review safety data protocol team stag enrollment plan require interim safety review proceed next step . The study plan include one enrollment per day first 3 vaccinated subject group . After least 3 day follow-up , interim safety review occur enrollment additional subject group . When least 2 week follow-up safety data first 3 vaccinated subject Group 1 , interim safety review occur proceed next dose level . Part 2 : About 130 subject enrol show Schema table . Group 3 open subject receive Ebola DNA WT vaccine protocol VRC 206 receive cAd3-EBO booster vaccine 2 time 10 ( 11 ) PU dose . Group 4 randomization subject two dosage group cAd3-EBOZ . Group 5 evaluation cAd3-EBO vaccine 2 time 10 ( 11 ) PU dose . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 9 clinic visit 48 week .</detailed_description>
