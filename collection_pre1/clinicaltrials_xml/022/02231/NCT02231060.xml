	<brief_title>Study Improvement Long-Term Outcome Prediction Patients Coma After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HOPE conduct 2.5-year multicenter prospective cohort study Germany outcome prediction early stage coma caused cerebral hypoxia-ischemia . The main feature project : - Control self-fulfilling prophecy - Long-term follow-up ( 12 month ) cover acute neurorehabilitation phase - Use sensitive measure level consciousness - Further in-depth systematic examination predictive value somato-sensory evoked potential ( SSEP ) Using reference exist guideline previous research , consider follow factor predictor negative outcome high specificity &gt; 90 % small 95 % confidence interval : loss cortical N20 SEP potential , loss one brain stem reflex , non-reactive EEG , NSE 33 mcg/L . We refer presence specific unfavourable test result ICU treatment `` negative predictor '' . Therefore , null hypothesis probability favourable outcome , despite presence negative predictor , &lt; 10 % . We use Simon 's two-stage design . The null hypothesis test one-sided alternative . In first stage , accrue 72 patient . If 8 few good outcome 72 patient , study discontinue null hypothesis could reject . Otherwise , recruit 100 additional patient gather total 172 . The null hypothesis reject 28 favourable outcome observe 172 patient . This design yield type I error rate 0.05 power 80 % true response rate 25 % , i.e . indeed 25 % patient favourable outcome despite negative predictor . This calculation base assumption 25 % enrolled patient least one negative predictor . HOPE seven data entry point ( i.e . study visit ) .The primary endpoint completion follow-up period patient death . HOPE collect clinical demographic data accordance Utstein-style recommendation . The crucial part study determine current level consciousness mean revise version Coma Recovery Scale ( CRS-R ) . The CRS-R allows precise categorization current level consciousness base structure systematic clinical examination auditory , visual , motor , oromotor , communication arousal function . Other assessment instrument employ yield information functional outcome/ADL , neuropsychological performance , health-related quality life . Study center collect data prospectively follow data acquisition timeline ( e.g . t0 t6 ) . Visits t0 t2 take place acute-setting ICUs ; visit t3 t5 neurorehabilitation center ; visit t6 patient ' location residence 12 month day 0 . A manual data dictionary provide centre along case report form ( CRF ) . All study center send pseudonymized data weekly certify mail Central Study Centre ( CSC ) locate Department Neurology University Munich . All study centre , include CSC , check data completeness , plausibility , accuracy , consistency outlier . Legal representative coma patient , decline participate , ask provide data socio-demographic variable reason decline . The CSC store data database responsible safeguard analyse . Patients/Legal representative ask remain study follow-up . After completion follow-up period , datasets irreversibly anonymised . We analyze positive predictive value dichotomous prognostic marker ( favorable unfavourable SSEP ) . For purpose , use two definition favorable outcome , i.e . functional behavioral one . If outcome define respect independence daily life , use modify Rankin Scale score 0-3 ( symptoms - moderate disability , able walk independently ) categorize favorable functional outcome . In context catastrophic event cardiac arrest high likelihood permanent VS , experience patient family consider regain functional communication skill also favourable outcome . In separate analysis , therefore use recovery full consciousness measure CRS-R define favorable behavioral outcome . To analyse effect covariates functional behavioral outcome , use mixed effect regression model , include fix random effect . This method analyze longitudinal data highly effective examine change trajectories several unequally space wave data . Covariates sociodemographic variable , prognostic variable treatment factor ( e.g . use therapeutic hypothermia ) , adjust age sex .</detailed_description>
