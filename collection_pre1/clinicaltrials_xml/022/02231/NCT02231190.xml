	<brief_summary>As per non-clinical study , prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor GSK1278863 protect muscle unaccustomed exercise induce muscle damage enhance functional muscle repair . This study design investigate arm function , pain pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker unaccustomed maximal eccentric exercise concurrent administration GSK1278863 placebo . Primary objective study evaluate protective effect GSK1278863 eccentric exercise induce muscle injury . Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio ( 1 subject GSK1278863 every 1 subject placebo ) . Each subject give five oral dos GSK1278863/placebo total . The first dose administer immediately completion eccentric exercise 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 hour later . Subjects house till day 4 unit return follow-up visit 7-10 day discharge . After enrolment approximately 30 subject , enrolment pause plan interim analysis perform decide whether terminate enrolment/study , continue dose reduce dose 5 milligram ( mg ) .</brief_summary>
