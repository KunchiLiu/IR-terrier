	<brief_title>Prospective , Randomized , Controlled Study Assess Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability SLT vs. PLT Patients With POAG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomise , control study . Patients select study require bilateral laser trabeculoplasty IOP control . Eyes undergo medication wash-out 4 week prior baseline study session ( S1 ) . There security visit 2 week make sure IOPs remain within safe range . Following S1 study eye receive laser treatment , assign randomization , within period 2 week . Eyes randomize receive SLT ( SLT eye ) PLT ( PLT eye ) treatment . Both laser procedure perform one session ( 360° angle ) , patient tolerate . Otherwise , split two session ( treat 180° angle ) perform within 1 week . The pre- post-laser procedure apply eye . After sign dated patient inform consent form , patient undergo initial ophthalmic examination . The CLS place eye baseline 24-hour IOP pattern record session ( S1 ) , within 2 week precede laser treatment . Patients remain ambulatory encourage follow schedule close his/her usual lifestyle possible . At hour 24 , patient return clinic , device remove final ophthalmic examination conduct . Patient diary collect concomitant medication report . Following S1 study eye receive either SLT PLT laser treatment , assign randomization ( 1:1 ) , within period 2 week . The pre- post-laser procedure apply eye . At S2 ( 1 month laser treatment ) patient randomize 24-hour CLS record either SLT PLT eye ( 1:1 ) . The ophthalmic examination S1 conduct patient diary collect . At month 3 patient follow slit lamp examination IOP measurement . At month 6 12 , patient see complete ophthalmic examination include visual field exam ( Octopus , Switzerland ) , optic nerve retinal nerve fiber layer evaluation ( Spectralis OCT , Germany ) . The overall study duration patient limit 14 month .</detailed_description>
