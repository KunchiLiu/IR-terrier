They also want gather information people without alcohol problem , include information gene biological process body.. This help well understand , prevent , treat alcohol problem . Objective : -To look broad range trait people healthy people people alcohol problem . To study potential eligibility research protocol conduct NIH Clinical Center . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 older . - Not pregnant imprison . Design : - Participants physical exam . They answer question health alcohol drug use . They electrocardiogram check heart . They blood , urine , breath alcohol test . - Participants without alcohol problem , want treatment , sign second consent screen research . - Participants alcohol problem want treatment treat NIH Clinical Center . They offer sign second consent later time . - Participants may join inpatient treatment detox program . It could last 6 week . Or may join outpatient program . Some may . - After discharge , participant may call ask question drink health . - If participant sign second consent , : - complete paper- computer-based questionnaire . - give blood sample . - may brain scan use magnetic resonance imaging .

	<detailed_description>This study represent natural history protocol NIAAA main objective provide assessment , clinical care , evaluation , characterization screening . The specific goal protocol follow : - To provide clinical care , include limit medically assist withdrawal alcohol ( detoxification ) , well standard behavioral and/or pharmacological therapy indicate wish receive treatment alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) relate clinical condition . - To gather characterization measure individual wish participate protocol future NIH protocol ( protocol serf screen protocol ) , include standardize set clinical , behavioral , biochemical structural MRI-based phenotypic assessment , well whole genome genotype - To screen evaluate individual wish participate NIH clinical protocol ( provide treatment provide treatment AUD ) present protocol serve screen platform . Participants may individual current past AUD , well individual meet current past DSM criterion AUD . Healthy volunteer volunteer also enrol protocol . - Finally , protocol may also serve training purpose , may provide opportunity train fellows staff member NIAAA Clinical Programs . We collect information include item psychiatric diagnosis symptom , biomarkers liver organ damage , quantitative alcohol use history , substance use , family history alcoholism . Using information , investigator able clinically manage disorder need clinical attention , determine whether subject eligible NIH research study ( protocol serf screen platform ) base result screen evaluation participant interest receive treatment AUD .
