	<brief_summary>Ideally , postoperative inflammatory response part well-orchestrated mechanism contributes tissue heal rapid recovery . An exaggerated uncontrolled inflammatory response , however may lead catabolism , tissue damage organ failure . Omega-3 fatty acid may provide mean alter cellular immune response benefit patient . When omega-3 fatty acid incorporate membrane inflammatory cell , trigger intracellular signalling pathway result less pro-inflammatory response . They modify gene protein expression , modulate membrane protein activity act reservoir bioactive molecule . They also strong anti-inflammatory effect mediate resolution inflammation . Furthermore , omega-3 fatty acid improve erythrocyte function , vital adequate microcirculation , tissue oxygenation wound heal . The investigator hypothesize perioperative administration intravenous omega-3 fatty acid result rapid incorporation immune cell erythrocytes , thereby reduce postoperative inflammatory response improve erythrocyte function patient undergoing colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
