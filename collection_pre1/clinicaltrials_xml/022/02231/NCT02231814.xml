	<brief_title>Pilot Study Partial Enteral Nutrition With Unique Diet Treatment Adult Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Environmental factor , microbiome ( bacteria gut ) innate immunity play role pathogenesis Crohn 's disease .Exclusive enteral nutrition ( EEN ) find effective inducing remission active pediatric Crohn 's disease , Partial Enteral Nutrition ( PEN ) free diet ; suggest mechanism EEN depend exclusion dietary component . Dietary factor may play role pathogenesis disease , maybe important under-investigated therapeutic target . `` The Crohn 's Disease Exclusion Diet '' ( CDED ) palatable diet exclude component suspect interfere bacteria gut impair immune mechanism . Our group previously evaluate 47 patient use Crohn 's disease Exclusion Diet + 50 % Polymeric formula 6 week , demonstrate 78 % response rate 70 % disease remission rate use stringent criterion . This accompanied highly significant reduction marker inflammation ( C-reactive protein ( CRP ) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) ) , normalization CRP 70 % enter remission . Among patient 13 adult age 19-32 , remission rate 13 patient 69 % , similar pediatric data . Importantly , 6/7 patient study refuse drink formula use diet achieved remission , suggest exclusion partial enteral nutrition responsible high remission rate . Our former study evaluate mucosal heal end point , since perform colonoscopy 6- 12 week therapy neither ethical feasible child . At present , data nutritional therapy new dietary approach generate primarily child , new diet evaluate early mucosal healing . The objective pilot study generate data adult , evaluate diet long period time ( 24 week ) evaluate mucosal healing . The study prospective open label randomize control pilot trial adult , mild moderate Crohn 's disease receive Crohn 's Disease Exclusion Diet ( CDED ) 24 week . If effective , could enable use feasible , safe intervention induction maintenance remission new therapy adjunctive therapy medical therapy .</detailed_description>
