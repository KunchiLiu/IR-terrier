	<brief_title>64N Nutraceutical Prevention Childhood Diarrhea Pneumonia Low Resource Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diarrheal disease pneumonia two top four cause mortality child age five . In 2010 , 64 percent death age group due infectious cause . A majority death occur develop country . Although vaccine proven prevent pneumonia diarrheal disease due rotavirus , vaccine may available vulnerable child develop country . Barriers vaccination poor country include lack infrastructure , poor health system , lack finance , lack transportation . It estimate additional one billion US dollar need guarantee vulnerable population receive vaccination . Diarrheal disease especially problematic since pathogen rotavirus cause diarrhea child live develop country . Examples pathogens cause diarrhea include Vibrio cholera , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , Escherichia coli [ E. coli ] , Cryptosporidium , Entamoeba histolytica , Shigella . Parasitic worm Schistosoma genus also cause diarrheal disease poor country . In develop country , infant 0 11 month age high risk die diarrhea cause typical E. coli E. coli produce heat-stable toxin . Children 12 23 month age high risk die diarrhea cause Cryptosporidium . It recommend five pathogen ( i.e. , typical E. coli , E. coli produce heat-stable toxin , Cryptosporidium , Shigella , rotavirus ) target order decrease burden moderate-to-severe childhood diarrhea develop country . In order improve survival child age five low resource setting , cost-effective , patient-directed , accessible , innovative , alternative intervention culturally appropriate need explore . One intervention may confer passive immunity protect young child low resource setting multiple pathogenic cause childhood diarrhea well childhood pneumonia utilization 64N . 64N use Ayurvedic physician medicinal purpose human India also commonly used Western medicine prior development penicillin manufacture antibiotic . Both hyperimmune 64N unadulterated 64N studied child . Infants feed defatted hyperimmune 64N significantly decrease diarrhea due rotavirus compare infant receive milk market . In child 3 15 month age , 64N decrease rotavirus infection compare artificial infant formula . Treatment study also show benefit 64N diarrhea . In child present diarrhea due E. coli , administration 64N significantly decrease stool frequency compare placebo . 64N concentrate find effective treatment infant hemorrhagic diarrhea stop progression disease hemolytic urea syndrome . 64N also study child ( 1 10 year age ) mild moderate nonorganic failure thrive . In randomized controlled trial , author find Gomez index ( weight age index ) significantly improve 3 month 64N supplementation compare 64N supplementation . There side effect 64N . These limit lactose intolerance sensitivity milk protein .</detailed_description>
