	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare additional diagnostic yield obtain use acetic acid vital substance improve detection serrate lesion colonoscopy . Patients schedule screening , surveillance diagnostic colonoscopy recruit study randomize one two group . Each enrol subject undergo two `` back-to-back '' procedure limit examination right colon . Subjects Group A ( study group ) undergo standard colonoscopy . Once right colon fully examine , acetic acid 2 % spray right colon re-examined cecum hepatic flexure within frame-time two minute . Subjects Group B ( control group ) undergo second examination right colon without acid acetic within frame-time . Results two group analyze compare , primary outcome measure detection rate serrate lesion . Secondary outcome measure include adenoma detection rate right colon location , characteristic polyps detect , include size histological result . Subjects follow 24-72 hour telephone interview analysis unexpected adverse event . Clinical result analyze use various statistical measure significance .</brief_summary>
