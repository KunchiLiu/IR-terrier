	<brief_summary>The investigator look accurate pediatric healthcare worker judge quality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation , observation chest compression , accurate certain position near patient . The investigator participant fill survey quality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation several record resuscitation scenario .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Feedback CPR : Does Point View Matter ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric cardiac arrest lead significant productive year lose , huge emotional impact family caregiver . High quality CPR important predictor outcome cardiac arrest . Human visual observation commonly use important evaluate CPR quality . Interestingly , accuracy healthcare provider ' visual assessment CPR quality unknown . Primary Objective : To determine accuracy visual CPR assessment . Secondary Objective : 1 ) To identify optimal position relative patient accurate CPR assessment . 2 ) To determine health care practitioner ' accuracy identify CPR error . Methods : We videotape good quality CPR poor quality CPR simulate resuscitation . We record 4 video , one depicting high quality CPR , 3 depict common mistake make perform chest compression , videotape foot , head side patient . Pediatric acute care professional recruit watch randomize set 12 video clip , fill brief simple questionnaire assessment quality CPR perform . To assess accuracy CPR quality , quantitative data quality CPR perform 4 videotaped event capture confirm use Laerdal CPRcard© ( depth rate ) paediatric simulator SimJr© ( recoil ) . Operative definition : 1 . Chest compression depth : define maximum posterior deflection sternum prior chest recoil . In order accurate non-compressible surface must beneath patient . It consider shallow less 50 mm deep great 60mm . Adequate chest compression depth define 50-60 mm . 2 . Chest compression rate : define frequency chest compression per minute . It consider slow less 100 chest compression perform per minute , fast great 120 compression perform per minute . This rate calculate 60 second interval chest compression provide . Adequate chest compression rate define 100 120 compression per minute . 3 . Incomplete release compressions/Recoil : define `` lean '' phenomenon force completely remove compression . This best report simple binary measure : complete incomplete ( &gt; 2500g residual lean force ) . Adequate recoil complete chest wall recoil . Primary Outcome Measures : Proportion healthcare provider accurate visual assessment CPR quality . Secondary Outcome Measures : 1 . Proportion healthcare practitioner accurately report CPR quality position relation patient ( head , side foot bed ) . 2 . Proportion healthcare practitioner accurately identify CPR error ( rate , depth , recoil ) .</detailed_description>
