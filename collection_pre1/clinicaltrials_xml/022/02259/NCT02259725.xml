	<brief_title>Regorafenib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) advanced/metastatic patient carcinoid pancreatic islet cell tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival response rate advanced/metastatic poor prognosis patient carcinoid pancreatic islet cell tumor . II . To assess toxicity patient treat regorafenib . III . To explore marker angiogenesis relate outcome carcinoid pancreatic islet cell tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive regorafenib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
