	<detailed_description>The propose study evaluate safety feasibility preoperative administration nivolumab +/- ipilimumab patient high-risk resectable NSCLC , facilitate comprehensive exploratory characterization tumor immune milieu circulate immune cell soluble factor patient . Data obtain study provide valuable information plan prospective clinical trial anti-PD-1 immunotherapy NSCLC , peri-operative advanced disease set . Ultimately , highly desirable discover prospective biomarkers response toxicity allow patient NSCLC likely derive benefit receive anti-PD-1 treatment , conversely minimize risk toxicity ineffective treatment patient unlikely benefit . In addition , amendment study allow evaluation combination nivolumab anti-CTLA4 antibody , ipilimumab neoadjuvant set treatment resectable NSCLC . In large , multicohort , phase 1 trial , ORR combination ipilimumab nivolumab therapy patient unselected PD-L1 status range 39-47 % . Incidence grade 3-4 toxicity range 33-37 % across combination ipilimumab nivolumab cohort compare favorably rate toxicity due platinum doublet chemotherapy disease setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven nonsmallcell lung cancer ( core biopsy require ) . Squamous nonsquamous histology Diagnostic core biopsy specimen must review faculty pathologist SKCCC MSKCC Either formalin fix paraffin block minimum fifteen 5micron tissue section ( slide ) tumor biopsy sample must available biomarker evaluation ( study pathologist must review adequacy sample ) . This obtain archived tissue , new biopsy need . Stage High risk NSCLC resection option potential cure , assess faculty surgeon SKCCC MSKCC . This may include clinical stage IB ( ≥4cm ) , II IIIA ( see Appendix A ) . Subjects N3 nodal involvement include . ECOG performance status 01 Adequate organ function follow : Leukocytes ≥ 2,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 time upper limit normal Subjects must adequate lung function permit surgical resection determine preenrollment pulmonary function test include DLCO The effect nivolumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 23 week last dose nivolumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Sexually active fertile men must use effective barrier birth control partner WOCBP 31 week last dose nivolumab . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within two week registration . Women must breastfeed . Patient understand study regimen , requirement , risk discomfort able willing sign inform consent form . Voluntary sign dated IRB/IEC approve write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline must obtain performance protocol relate procedure part normal patient care . Subjects must competent report AEs , understand drug dosing schedule use medication control AEs . Subjects exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . Subjects exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . As potential hepatic toxicity nivolumab nivolumab/ipilimumab combination , drug predisposition hepatoxicity use caution patient treat nivolumabcontaining regimen . Administration chemotherapy cancer therapy preoperative period . Subjects active concurrent malignancy exclude i.e . cancer NSCLC ( except non melanoma skin cancer , situ bladder , gastric , breast , colon cervical cancers/dysplasia ) . Subjects brain metastasis exclude study , patient brain imaging ( either MRI brain CT brain contrast ) prior enrollment . Subjects history symptomatic interstitial lung disease . Active systemic infection require therapy , positive test Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . Known positive history positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . History allergy study drug component . Women pregnant nursing . Men female partner ( WOCBP ) willing use contraception . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( antibody target T cell coregulatory pathway ) . Underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation toxicity adverse event . Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g . infectious disease ) illness .</criteria>
