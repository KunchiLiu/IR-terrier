	<brief_summary>TAP block perform ultrasound guidance use part multimodal analgesia relieve pain abdominal surgery hospital . Choices local anaesthetic use include bupivacaine ropivacaine . Local anaesthetic work inhibit nerve transmission pain site tissue injury . An important component pain experience patient abdominal surgery derive abdominal wall incision . The abdominal wall sensory afferent course transversus abdominis ( neurofascial ) plane superficial transversus abdominis muscle . Single shot TAP block show provide pain relief 24h surgery involve pfannenstiel incision , hence study period 24h chosen patient undergo hysterectomy . This study design test hypothesis TAP block , part multimodal analgesic regimen , even low concentration , would provide effective analgesia first 24 h hysterectomy , comparison high concentration 0.4 % ropivacaine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study hypothesis TAP block perform 0.2 % ropivacaine inferior use 0.4 % ropivacaine . The primary outcome measure study 24 h morphine consumption . Secondary outcome measure include time first request morphine , VAS score , side effect associate morphine consumption include nausea , vomit , sedation , pruritus , well patient satisfaction . Our study hypothesis TAP block perform 0.2 % ropivacaine 40ml inferior use 0.4 % ropivacaine 40ml , term analgesia first 24h . Primary Objectives Morphine consumption first 24h differ 2 group 10mg . Secondary Objectives Secondary objective show morphine side effect similar two group low ropivacaine provide similar pain relief high concentration . Patient satisfaction also record . 54 patient undergoing hysterectomy recruit SGH . Criteria Recruitment Recruitment Process Patients shortlist surgical list week prior surgery . Patients see pre anaesthetic assessment clinic also invite take part study . A simple history physical assessment determine eligibility . Patients fit inclusion criterion approach study emphasis participation voluntary refusal participate affect subsequent conduct anaesthesia care . Patient 's wish respect request participate STUDY DESIGN Double blind randomise control trial . Study design non-inferiority trial test 0.2 % ropivacaine v 0.4 % ropivacaine . Expected 1 year complete recruitment 54 patient . All patient expect participate study period 24h followup convalescence hospital . There change scheduling operation additional visit purpose study . Ultrasound image block may store thumb drive . However , image link patient identifier . It store password protect thumb drive keep department lock key . It may use illustration research publish scientific journal . Randomisation Blinding Patients randomise 2 group - 0.2 % 0.4 % ropivacaine group . The allocation sequence generate random number table , group allocation conceal seal , opaque envelope , open prior block performance . The anaesthesiologist perform block anaesthesia blind . However , patient , surgeon researcher collect subsequent patient data blind . Randomisation code break final analysis study result . As study group involve use ropivacaine concentration maximum recommend dose , likelihood need break randomisation code low . However , become necessary , study PI break code . Study Visits Procedures Study visit 1 : recruitment pre-anaesthesia visit day surgery Procedure : Bilateral TAP block surgery , reversal anaesthesia . Followup 24h , include 1 study visit elicit pain score side effect opioids . Screening Visits Procedures History physical examination require evaluate recruitment criterion . Patients invited participate study meeting inclusion criterion . Study Visits Procedures 1 visit post operative period . Final Study Visit : Patient see operation first post operative day assess VAS score , side effect associate morphine consumption include nausea , vomit , sedation , pruritus , well patient satisfaction . Post Study Follow Procedures Patient see operation first post operative day assess VAS score , side effect associate morphine consumption include nausea , vomit , sedation , pruritus , well patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
