	<detailed_description>Since 1988 , Helen Keller International 's ( HKI ) flagship Homestead Food Production ( HFP ) program Asia help community establish technically-improved local food production system create garden yield micronutrient-rich fruit vegetable expand grow season , complement improved rearing poultry livestock . In 2010 , HKI introduce enhanced-HFP ( E-HFP ) model Burkina Faso include strengthened nutrition education component ; Essential Nutrition Actions ( ENA ) framework . This E-HFP program evaluate IFPRI yield encouraging result . With regard nutritional outcome , however , primary finding , E-HFP program improve hemoglobin concentration—an indicator iron status—the evaluation fail note significant impact program improve child 's growth . The primary explanation absence measurable improvement child 's growth lack complementary health intervention aim specifically reduce child 's disease burden , , along lack adequate food care , underlie cause undernutriton ( UNICEF 1990 ) . Building lesson learn Burkina Faso E-HFP program 2011 Tanzania HFP program , new model , Enhanced Homestead Food Production Plus ( E-HFP+ ) , develop Tanzania improve nutritional status infant young child . The new model strengthen Behavior Change Communication ( BCC ) malaria prevention , WASH , gender component enhance link health sector . The model also test two new concept : 1. assess E-HFP+ program potential maintain adequate level hemoglobin concentration increase iron-rich food consumption malaria prevention good practice . 2. assess effectiveness anemia use exist agriculture-based platform promote uptake utilization MNP . The model involve set production nutrition intervention target mother provision curative treatment moderate severe anemia ( Micronutrient Powder ) . The main objective impact evaluation E-HFP+ program therefore assess whether program : - Maintains reduce anemia level among pre-school aged child blanket provision Micronutrient Powder ( MNP ) - Improves child growth ( measure HAZ WHZ ) - Improves infant young child feeding ( IYCF ) practice maternal knowledge health nutrition - Is appropriate delivery platform enhance uptake utilization MNP supplementation child</detailed_description>
