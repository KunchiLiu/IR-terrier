	<brief_summary>Rationale : The live attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) vaccine protect extrapulmonary infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis leprosy . It show vaccination BCG also lead nonspecific protective effect , e.g . reduce infant mortality result less severe infection , stimulation immune system patient bladder cancer high cytokine production upon restimulation macrophage non-related infectious pathogen vitro . However , live attenuate BCG vaccine use immune compromised host , investigator would like determine whether similar protective non-specific effect induce γ-irradiated BCG . Objective : To determine whether vaccination γ-irradiated BCG result higher cytokine response monocytes upon restimulation vitro infectious pathogen , compare monocyte vaccination . Study design : Explorative intervention trial . Study population : Healthy volunteer , 18 - 55 year old . Intervention : Healthy volunteer vaccinate γ-irradiated BCG vaccine . Main study parameters/endpoints : Blood draw two different time point vaccination BCG perform restimulation isolate cell vitro compare cytokine production . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : There know direct benefit volunteer participate trial . The risk negligible . BCG vaccination cause pain scar site injection , fever headache . Local hematoma formation occur site blood draw . This minimized blood collection experience person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE The live attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) vaccine protect extrapulmonary infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis leprosy [ 1 , 2 ] . It show vaccination BCG also lead non-specific protective effect : early administration BCG vaccination could lead reduce child mortality , mainly result reduce neonatal sepsis , respiratory infection , fever . [ 3-5 ] Furthermore , BCG also use patient bladder cancer , induce improve reaction immune system , prevents tumor progression dead . [ 6 ] Recently , show BCG vaccination induce epigenetic change human monocyte , result high pro-inflammatory cytokine response upon restimulation non-related pathogen vitro . [ 7 ] The observed effect propose due modulation human innate immune system , process call 'trained immunity ' . Upon stimulation pathogen , innate immune system become prim able react faster efficient secondary ( non-related ) stimulus . [ 7 , 8 ] Considering beneficial effect BCG innate host defense , reasonable hypothesize would helpful generate 'trained immunity status ' host defective T- B-cell immunity , vulnerable infection . However , immune compromise status , patient vaccinate live attenuate vaccine ( e.g . BCG ) . [ 9 ] Vaccination y-irradiated BCG would possible , know whether γ-irradiated vaccine protective non-specific effect innate host defense . In recent in-vitro experiment , investigator demonstrate y-irradiated BCG train monocyte vitro ( publish ) . Therefore , aim study determine whether γ-irradiated BCG able train human innate immune system healthy volunteer in-vivo , show live attenuate BCG vaccine [ 7 ] . 2 . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : To determine whether γ-irradiated BCG train innate immune system vivo , compare cytokine production upon ex-vivo restimulation pathogen , 2 week 3 month vaccination y-irradiated BCG . 3 . STUDY DESIGN An explorative intervention study duration three month perform . 15 Healthy volunteer recruit receive vaccination γ-irradiated BCG . After informed consent , 40ml blood drawn vaccination 2 week 3 month post-vaccination . 4 . STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population Healthy volunteer , 18 - 55 yr old . 4.2 Inclusion criteria The subject must healthy adult , age 18 - 55 year old . 4.3 Exclusion criterion Subjects exclude tuberculosis endemic country , contact tuberculosis patient already vaccinate BCG . The subject exclude study suffer disease , include intercurrent infection . Subjects allow use medication except oral anticonceptive agent . 4.4 Sample size calculation This explorative trial , sample size calculation possible . 5 . TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational product/treatment Subjects vaccinate y-irradiated BCG vaccine ( BCG-Vaccin SSI [ Nederlands Vaccin Instituut ] ) , purchase Radboud Apotheek B.V. γ-Irradiation BCG vaccine perform Synergy Health Ede B.V. , Ede , The Netherlands ( register Dutch Ministry Economic Affairs ) . The BCG vaccine radiate original packaging average dose 32.2kGy JS6500 Tote Box Irradiator . This dose base literature accept minimal dose 25kGy , proven sufficient kill M. tuberculosis [ 10 , 11 ] . After irradiation vaccine return unopened original packaging . During irradiation dosimeter include , irradiate batch come along certificate exact irradiation dose use . 5.2 Use co-intervention Subjects allow use medication , except oral anticonception . 6 . INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 6.1 Name description investigational product ( ) y-Irradiated BCG vaccine ( BCG-Vaccin SSI [ Nederlands Vaccin Instituut ] ) Danish strain 1331 . 6.2 Summary finding non-clinical study The efficacy kill γ-irradiating BCG vaccine verify culture y-irradiated BCG special tuberculosis culture medium . No growth detect six week . 6.3 Summary finding clinical study A related study comparable study setup , 20 healthy volunteer vaccinate live attenuated BCG vaccine already accomplish . [ 7 ] The investigator study use study protocol . The difference instead live attenuate BCG vaccine y-irradiated BCG vaccine use . 6.4 Summary know potential risk benefit There clear benefit volunteer . Potential risk small , BCG consider safe vaccine . BCG vaccination cause pain scar site injection fever headache , sporadic occur side effect syncope , convulsion allergic reaction . Local hematoma formation occur site blood draw . 6.5 Description justification route administration dosage Administer upper arm slowly , 10 second , intracutaneous 0.1ml suspended vaccine , account 0.075mg Mycobacterium bovis . 7 . METHODS 7.1 Study parameters/endpoints Before vaccination two different time point vaccination γ-irradiated BCG ( 2 week 3 month ) blood drawn , PBMCs isolate density centrifugation Ficoll-Paque . Monocytes restimulated ex-vivo different pathogen ( M. tuberculosis ( 1µg/ml ) , S. aureus , C. albicans ( 1 x 10^6 microorganisms/ml ) , E. coli LPS ( 10ng/ml ) . Cytokine production assess 24h ( TNFa , IL 1b IL-6 ) , 48h ( IFN , IL-10 ) 7 day ( IL-17 , IL-22 ) stimulation , compare cytokine production vaccination . 7.2 Study procedure Subjects vaccinate y-irradiated BCG vaccine . Before twice vaccination , 40ml blood drawn . 7.3 Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . 7.4 Replacement individual subject withdrawal Each withdrawn subject replace , order total 15 subject complete follow-up .</detailed_description>
