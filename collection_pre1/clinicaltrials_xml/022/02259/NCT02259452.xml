	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess time , dose dependence , fraction-size dependence radiation ( RT ) -induced change regional lung heart perfusion/function/structure follow thoracic RT deliver use new IMRT/conformal/radiosurgery technique . The PI hop develop model well relate predict RT-induced change regional lung heart perfusion/function/structure change global cardiopulmonary function . Patients undergo pre- serial post-RT lung heart assessments good understand RT-induced regional heart/lung change .</brief_summary>
