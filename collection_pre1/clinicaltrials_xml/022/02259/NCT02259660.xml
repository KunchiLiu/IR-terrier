	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine muscle train improve snore obstructive sleep apnea . Subjects receive sleep study determine severity apnea . After study , subject randomly assign one two group . The first group receive breathe trainer may strengthen muscle use breath . The second group receive sham trainer look like `` real '' trainer able produce strengthen effect . Both group complete eight week home base ( real sham ) training . The sleep study repeat well measure change measure severity obstructive sleep apnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder characterize intermittent narrowing closure upper airway sleep . Loss muscle tone sleep onset decrease ventilatory drive follow loss wakefulness stimuli breathe combine result upper airway closure patient structurally susceptible upper airway . We hypothesize train upper airway muscle improve sleep apnea augment rest upper airway muscle tone ability muscle respond negative intraluminal pressure . Training primitive wind instrument ( Digeridoo ) oral pharyngeal exercise ( OPE ) use speech therapy show improve sleep apnea . Individuals play certain type wind instrument appear low risk sleep apnea . However , date mechanism improvement optimal method upper airway train well define . We recently complete study facial exerciser ( Facial Flex ) design improve facial muscle tone find decrease snore group loud snore minimal sleep apnea . A group UF physiologist ( include co investigator Drs . Davenport Silverman ) also demonstrate brief period train high inspiratory and/or expiratory threshold load improved cough swallowing patient impairment upper airway function . Although respiratory pump muscle provide drive force pressure generation training pressure threshold load , upper airway muscle must maintain patent upper airway resist high negative positive intraluminal pressure . For example , palate must maintain seal prevent air escape nose high positive pressure generate mouthpiece . Of interest limit number high intensity effort appear optimal way train muscle . We propose target group mild moderate OSA patient ( apnea-hypopnea index &lt; 30/hour ) severely obese ( BMI &lt; 35 Kg/M2 ) significant structural abnormality upper airway muscle dysfunction . We perform randomize control trial ( train versus sham training ) 25 subject treatment arm use two month daily training ( 5 7 day week ) . A home sleep study ( include EEG ) perform follow training . The change apnea-hypopnea index adjust sleep stage body position compare . Use home sleep study dramatically reduce cost study . A sleep technologist educate subject performance maneuver meet weekly observe subject 's technique . A training log keep subject use training schedule sheet daily training monitor weekly web-based communication study clinician .</detailed_description>
