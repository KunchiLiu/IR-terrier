	<detailed_description>This study single-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , single ascend dose escalation study determine safety , tolerability , PK profile oral administration HPN-07 single dos healthy male female subject 18 55 year age . Approximately 32 subject enrol panel 4 cohort approximately 8 subject per cohort . There approximately 3 sequential ascend dosing level HPN-07 , cohort administer 1 dose HPN-07 range 500 mg 1,500 mg fourth cohort administer high tolerate dose HPN-07 plus 1,200 mg NAC . The primary endpoint trial establish safety tolerability HPN-07 HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) analysis HPN-07 enable preliminary determination relationship dose time course drug concentration body . Blood sample collect regular interval predict time HPN-07 systemic exposure .</detailed_description>
