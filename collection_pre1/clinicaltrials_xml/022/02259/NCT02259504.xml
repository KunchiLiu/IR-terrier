	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Intracranial aneurysm ( IAs ) common cerebrovascular abnormality . The prevalence IAs report 0.8-2.0 % population . [ 1-3 ] The common presentation IAs subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , annual incidence varies geographic region 10 20 per 100,000 . [ 4 5 ] SAH devastate injury case-fatality rate 51 % [ 5 ] . Nearly half survivor functionally incapacitate [ 6 ] . There limited data natural history small intracranial aneurysm . According International Study Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms , risk spontaneous aneurysm rupture relate aneurysm size location . ISUIA find aneurysms &lt; 10 mm diameter , oppose aneurysms 10-24 mm &gt; 25 mm , relative risk rupture 11.6 59 , respectively . Further follow-up cohort show 5-year bleeding risk 0 % , 2.6 % , 14.5 % , 40 % aneurysms le 7 mm , 7 -- 12 mm , 13 -- 24 mm , 25 mm great , respectively . Many author ( Juvela 2000 Weir 2002 ) also suggest risk small aneurysm rupture relatively low . The Sapporo SAH Study group suggest overall rupture risk small aneurysms low , aneurysm size ratio strong predictor aneurysm rupture small ( &lt; 5mm ) intracranial aneurysms [ 7 ] . However , author unpublished data ( MUSC ) demonstrate approximately one-third rupture aneurysms less 4 mm size . Endovascular coil intracranial aneurysm show safe efficacious treatment intracranial aneurysm . The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial ( ISAT ) show endovascular coil reduce morbidity mortality compare clip aneurysm set SAH . [ 8 ] . The goal endovascular coil prevent rupture rebleeding isolate aneurysm normal blood circulation without narrow parent vessel . A main concern endovascular treatment long-term durability treatment , say possible aneurysm recanalize ( recur ) treat coil [ 9 ] . Some factor recanalization incomplete initial occlusion , large aneurysm size , rupture aneurysm , partially thrombose aneurysm , compaction coil mass within aneurysm [ 9 10 ] . In Study Nguyen [ 11 ] , incomplete initial aneurysm occlusion , rupture large aneurysm size associate significant recanalization . Johnston [ 12 ] conclude degree occlusion initial treatment strong predictor risk subsequent rupture , justified attempt completely occlude aneurysm . Two series small unruptured intracranial aneurysm [ 13 14 ] find recurrence rate 5.9 % 16.9 % retreatment rate 1.7 % 2.9 % . The majority retreatments small wide necked aneurysm . However , recurrence rate small aneurysms much less large aneurysm ( 71 % vs 35 % ) [ 15 ] . The main concern treatment small aneurysm ( less 4 mm ) safety , namely concern intraprocedural rupture thromboembolic event . The ATENA Study show risk intraprocedural aneurysm rupture significantly high small aneurysm ( 3.7 % 1-6 mm vs 7 % 7-15 mm ; p= 0.008 ) . The rate failure EVT significantly high small unruptured aneurysm compare large aneurysm ( 13.7 % vs 3.3 % respectively ) . This likely related several factor . Microcatheterization aneurysm sac may challenge due aneurysm size place even small coil , maybe challenge small aneurysm . In series [ 13 14 ] , 10.4 % overall procedural complication rate find . There 24 embolic event , 11 coil protrusion 4 aneurysm rupture , Oishi find 3.8 % thromboembolic event rate 1.4 % risk aneurysm rupture . Nguyen et al report intraprocedural rupture rate 11.7 % aneurysms le 3 mm diameter [ 16 ] . In meta-analysis , Brinjikji et al find procedural rupture rate 8.3 % small aneurysm Spiotta et al demonstrate 13.5 % rate intraprocedural rupture rupture aneurysms less 4 mm [ 17 ] Other study find morbidity mortality rate range 0.8 % -7 % 0-1.4 % [ 13 14 18 ] . The introduction Microvention HyperSoft® 3D line coil size 1 5mm may help reduce historical risk failure treat intraprocedural rupture . The complex shape coil may allow stable frame aneurysms follow dense pack aneurysm sac neck , therefore prevent recurrence . The softness coil may allow increase confidence safety treat aneurysm , may express reduction intraprocedural complication . 1.2 Pathophysiology Prevalence Aneurysms A cerebral intracranial aneurysm focal dilation artery brain result weaken inner muscular layer ( intima ) blood vessel wall . The pathogenesis intracranial aneurysm remain incompletely understood . Most aneurysms arise sporadically occasionally may : dissecting ( result luminal endothelial tear ) , traumatic ( usually within 2-3 week severe head injury ) mycotic ( result embolism infect material ) . Aneurysm etiology multifactorial , include congenital medial arterial wall defect , degenerative change , accrue hemodynamic stress , particularly sit turbulent blood flow . Contributing factor include connective tissue disorder , hypertension , anatomy variation , atherosclerosis , trauma , mycosis , tumor . Epidemiological study already identify aneurysm-specific risk factor size location , well patient-specific risk factor , age ( high adult ) , sex ( high female ) , presence medical comorbidities , hypertension . In addition , exposure certain environmental factor smoke show important formation IA . Furthermore , substantial evidence prove certain loci contribute genetically IA pathogenesis . Genome-wide linkage study use relative pair rare family affect Mendelian form IA already show genetic heterogeneity IA , suggest multiple gene , alone combination , important disease pathophysiology [ 19 ] . Aneurysm wall thickness varies throughout sac . The thickness great neck least fundus . Compared small aneurysm , calcification atheroma commonly see large aneurysm . Macrophages , present stage atherosclerosis , secrete lytic enzyme ( e.g. , elastases , collagenase , metalloproteases ) , lead destruction connective tissue erosion arterial wall . Smooth muscle cell apoptosis elastin/collagen fiber reconstruction mechanism contribute vessel wall weaken [ 20 ] . The weakening aneurysm wall demonstrate histological study find degeneration endothelial cell internal elastic lamina thin medial layer [ 21 ] . Aneurysm wall tension stressor note important contributor growth , remodel rupture aneurysm . Focal turbulence discontinuity normal architecture vessel bifurcation may account propensity saccular aneurysm formation [ 22 ] . The frequency cerebral aneurysm difficult ascertain variation definition size aneurysm mode detection . Autopsy series cite prevalence 0.2-7.9 % . Prevalence range 5-10 % , unruptured aneurysm account 50 % aneurysm . Pediatric aneurysms account 2 % cerebral aneurysm . In United States , incidence rupture aneurysm approximately 12 per 100,000 individual 30,000 annual case aneurysmal SAH . The frequency cerebral aneurysm decline recent year . [ 22 ] Saccular ( berry ) aneurysms constitute 90 % cerebral aneurysm usually locate major branch point large artery . Saccular aneurysm frequently rupture subarachnoid space , account 70-80 % spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage . Annually , 15,000 American patient SAH aneurysms maximum diameter &lt; 7 mm consequently experience irreparable morbidity severe mortality . The majority aneurysms unruptured , single , asymptomatic , even small point rupture [ 23 ] . Fusiform arteriosclerotic aneurysm elongate outpouchings proximal artery account 7 % cerebral aneurysms infectious mycotic aneurysm usually situate peripherally comprise 0.5 % cerebral aneurysm . Small aneurysms less 10 mm diameter . Larger aneurysms 10-25 mm giant aneurysms great 25 mm diameter [ 24 ] . About 80-90 % aneurysm small 10-20 % large giant [ 5 ] . Both rupture unruptured aneurysm candidate endovascular therapy . The natural history unruptured intracranial aneurysm still unclear influenced many factor previous subarachnoid hemorrhage another aneurysm , history cigarette smoking , coexist medical condition , aneurysm characteristic size , location , morphology [ 25 ] . In Study natural history aneurysm determine risk rupture , Juvela [ 26 ] follow 142 patient 181 unruptured aneurysm mean 13.9 year ( range 0.8 - 30 year ) death subarachnoid hemorrhage . The annual rupture rate 1.4 % . The median diameter aneurysm follow 4 mm diagnosis . Fourteen intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) fatal ; author conclude unruptured aneurysm treat technically feasible irrespective size . 1.3 Treatment option intracranial aneurysm The wide availability use noninvasive imaging increase frequency incidental discovery intracranial aneurysm . There two broad category intracranial aneurysm : rupture , create subarachnoid hemorrhage unruptured . Subarachnoid hemorrhage aneurysm rupture devastate event . It estimate 40 % individual whose aneurysm rupture survive first 24 hour : another 25 % die complication within 6 month . Early diagnosis treatment important . [ 27 ] Aneurysm treatment include medical , surgical endovascular therapy . Medical therapy involve general supportive measure prevention complication individual periprocedural period poor surgical candidate include : control hypertension , calcium channel blocker , prevention seizure antibiotic therapy present infectious aneurysm . In microsurgical approach , section skull remove . The brain tissue spread apart reveal aneurysm small metal clip place base aneurysm block flow blood . Alternative microsurgical technique involve proximal Hunterian ligation , wrap aneurysm trapping ( i.e. , combination proximal distal vessel occlusion ) . [ 22 ] Endovascular therapy ( EVT ) involve insertion catheter femoral artery patient 's leg navigating though vascular system head aneurysm . Once , several treatment option available : detachable coil may deploy within aneurysm occlude parent artery blood flow , may do alone use adjunctive technique balloon remodel intracranial stenting parent artery . In balloon remodeling , temporary occlusion balloon inflate across neck aneurysm coil introduce . The balloon function prevent prolapse coil parent vessel . Although temporary occlusion balloon provide support coil introduction , sometimes coil prolapse parent artery immediately balloon deflation [ 28 ] . Also wide-necked irregular shape aneurysm may lack neck structure make coil placement difficult impossible . These aneurysm may intracranial stent place parent artery cross neck aneurysm . The coil introduce stent order help jail within aneurysm . Parent vessel occlusion , although common aneurysm coiling perform mostly fusiform acute dissect artery involve complete occlusion parent vessel coil sometimes embolic liquid . Embolization detachable coil safe effective treatment brain aneurysm . The 1-year result ISAT Study [ 29 ] endovascular coiling aneurysm ( consider suitable neurosurgical clip endovascular coiling ) yield significant advantage neurosurgical clipping term death severe disability . Of patient allocated endovascular treatment , 250 1063 ( 23.5 % ) dead dependent 1 year compare 326 1055 ( 30.9 % ) patient allocate neurosurgical clipping . As , absolute risk reduction calculate 7.4 % ( 95 % CI : 3.6-11.2 ; P = .0001 ) favor endovascular treatment . Because significant difference coil clipping , treatment patient rupture intracranial aneurysm change significantly past year , particularly Europe . In many center , coil become method choice coil clip consider suitable individual patient . At 5 year , 11 % ( 112 1046 ) patient endovascular group 14 % ( 144 1041 ) patient neurosurgical group die . The risk death 5 year significantly low coil group clip group [ 8 ] . Although endovascular coil show safe effective treatment , patient require repeat treatment recurrence aneurysm [ 30 31 ] . Published series regard mid long-term clinical outcome follow angiographic finding confirm recanalization may occur 33 % treated patient , also tend increase aneurysm wider neck large size [ 2 30 32 33 ] . In case coil aneurysm , large aneurysm likely recur small one rupture aneurysm likely recur unruptured one [ 11 30 ] . Over last decade , significant improvement endovascular technique development wide range device include 3-D coil , spherical coil , complex coil . The introduction balloon stent remodel technique result expansion device technique available neurointerventionalists , make EVT possible great percentage patient . Enhancement platinum coil thrombogenicity attempt surface modification use Dacron® fiber , bioabsorbable polymer ( Cerecyte® coil , Codman/Micrus Endovascular ; Matrix®coil , Boston Scientific ) hydrogel coating ( HydroCoil® , MicroVention ) . The use non adhesive embolic agent Onyx® ( ev3 ) aneurysm embolization proven occlusive method , patient , completely fill conforms unique geometry aneurysm cavity , result complete aneurysm obliteration . A relatively new technique use Parent Vessel Reconstruction use stent ( Neuroform® microstent Boston Scientific , Enterprise™ Codman® , Pipeline Embolization Device , Covidien ) coil aneurysm change parent vessel configuration , redirect flow blood help reduce wall shear stress aneurysm promote tissue growth neck aneurysm . 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective post-marketing Study assess clinical image outcome endovascular treatment small ( ≤ 4.9 mm ) intracranial aneurysms utilize HyperSoft® 3D ( HydroSoft® 3D , commercially available ) HyperSoft® helical coil specifically design treatment small aneurysm . The neck aneurysm may protect coil balloon stent indicate use neurovasculature . It hypothesize framing , fill neck finish use HyperSoft® 3D , HydroSoft® 3D HyperSoft® helical coil , aid balloon remodel stent assistance appropriate , yield good occlusion rate , may lower recanalization retreatment rate safer ( reduce intraprocedural aneurysm rupture rate ) compare historical data use early generation technology . 2.1 Primary Endpoints - Efficacy : Raymond-Roy grade scale ( RRGS ) 2 good occlusion follow angiography perform &gt; 150 day post embolization , require retreatment - Safety : Freedom imaging-confirmed new post-procedural hemorrhage ischemic stroke associate 4-point worsening NIHSS within 48 hour aneurysm treatment new aneurysmal SAH secondary treat aneurysm 2.2 Secondary Endpoints - Any neurological morbidity mortality ( evaluated time &gt; 150-day angiographic follow ) - Bleeding rate target aneurysm , include rebleeding target rupture aneurysm ( one year ) - Recurrence rate/recanalization ( evaluated time &gt; 150-day angiographic follow ) - Retreatment rate ( one year )</detailed_description>
