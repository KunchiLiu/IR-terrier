	<brief_title>Effect Exercise Rehabilitation Program Patients Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals end-stage kidney disease require HD suffer multiple symptom , limited effective treatment . Symptom burden , combine impact number severity symptom , negatively impact functional status health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) HD . Small interventional trial suggest exercise mitigate specific individual symptom , impact exercise overall symptom burden HD unknown . Dialysis patient identify improve symptom burden HRQOL research priority . We propose first randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigate effect exercise rehabilitation symptom burden individual HD . Hypothesis : In individual HD , participation 12-week exercise rehabilitation ( rehab ) program reduce symptom burden improve HRQOL , result reduce disability improve long-term clinical outcome compare standard care . Study Design : Single-centre RCT one-to-one parallel design , allocation concealment assessor blind Study Population : Adults receive chronic in-centre HD &gt; 3 month least one dialysis-related symptom ; n=150 Intervention : Standard care plus 12-week structured rehab program ( lifestyle education , resistance exercise cycle HD ) . Control : Standard care ( baseline exercise counseling ) Outcomes measured baseline , 12 , 26 52 week . Data Analysis : Will perform intention treat , available case basis t-tests Mann Whitney U continuous outcome , per data distribution Chi square test categorical outcome . Mixed effect model account repeat outcome measure time . Poisson regression perform hospitalization analysis . Anticipated Outcomes : Mean symptom burden severity score decrease 20 % baseline intervention group . Due sustain physical activity intervention group , symptom burden remain low group 6 12 month . In contrast , control group see improvement symptom burden baseline .</detailed_description>
