	<brief_summary>Patients high risk IVIG-associated hemolysis ( defined receipt 28-day cumulative dose ≥ 2 g/kg , adjust ideal body weight , non-O blood group ) prospectively monitor use standardize protocol sign hemolysis , undergo additional testing variable hypothesize increase risk hemolysis . The goal study define incidence dynamic IVIG-mediated hemolysis identify patient product-related factor may predict patient especially risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All IVIG order receive blood transfusion service participate site screen patient eligibility . All non-O blood group patient receive cumulative 28-day dose IVIG ≥ 2 g/kg approach enrolment . Exclusion criterion include presence alternate cause anemia , include blood loss , drug-induced hemolysis , anemia associate chemotherapy cancer , hemolysis associate underlying disease participation another ongoing study . Patients receive repeated course therapy eligible re-enrollment maximum 6 time . There otherwise exclusion basis age , diagnosis , concurrent treatment , specific brand product receive . Enrolment occur multiple Canadian health care facility . Upon enrolment , case report form document participant 's previous medical history , IVIG treatments adverse reaction , concurrent medication use collect . Laboratory test hemolysis perform baseline , immediately follow complete high-dose cycle ( usually administer 1-2 day ) , 5-10 day post-infusion . IVIG associate . Hemolysis define grade per criterion Canadian IVIG Pharmacovigilance Group . The pathophysiology IVIG-associated hemolysis characterize tracking change serum complement level , perform extend cytokine profiling , conduct mononuclear phagocyte activity assay use patient monocyte . Secretor gene status , ABO zygosity FcR polymorphism also determine . A predictive model incorporate patient factor ( eg. , blood group , total dose prescribed , presence pre-infusion inflammation ) product factor ( eg. , specific lot number ) develop .</detailed_description>
