	<brief_summary>Malignant melanoma lead cause death cutaneous malignancy , account approximately three-fourths skin cancer death . For metastatic unresectable melanoma , standard treatment option include immune checkpoint inhibitor ( e.g. , ipilimumab nivolumab ) therapy , however , approve therapy rarely curative . It well accept tumor able evade detection eradication immune system , even though many tumor type , particularly melanoma , capable elicit strong immune response ( Swann , 2007 ) . Substantial mechanistic work recent year reveal key role myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) mask cancer cell immune system , promote tumor progression resistance cancer immunotherapy . The immune-suppressive effect MDSCs dependent production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reactive nitrogen specie ( RNS ) . High level reactive molecule by-product , nitrotyrosine , correlate poor clinical outcome melanoma . Currently available melanoma therapy target MDSCs . In animal , RTA 408 significantly reduces tumor nitrotyrosine burden , inhibit activity MDSCs , augment T-cell anticancer activity relevant dos . Thus , inhibition MDSC activity suppression tumor ROS/RNS , RTA 408 may work combination T-cell-activating therapeutic ipilimumab enhance natural immune anticancer response . RTA 408 also direct anticancer effect via inhibition NF-kappa B . Chronic activation NF-kappa B associate tumor progression , metastasis , resistance therapy . This propose study design assess safety , efficacy , pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) combination ipilimumab nivolumab patient unresectable metastatic melanoma . In open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation , Phase 1b/2 study , patient qualify receive omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) assign dose level combination ipilimumab nivolumab . Patients receive omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) orally daily 1 week prior initiation ipilimumab nivolumab . For patient treated ipilimumab , run-in period follow omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) orally daily combination ipilimumab administer Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 . After Week 10 , patient receive maintenance treatment omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) alone daily . For patient treated nivolumab , run-in period follow omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) orally daily combination nivolumab administer approximately every two week clinically indicate . Each patient continue assign omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) dose level disease progression occur , toxicity require discontinuation study drug ( i.e. , RTA 408 ) experience , patient complete approximately 72 week treatment , patient discontinue study drug another reason , patient withdraws consent . Patients return 4 week omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) treatment completion follow-up visit . The start omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) dose level first dose-escalation cohort study select base available safety pharmacodynamic data Phase 1 study RTA 408 ( NCT02029729 ) . Subsequent cohort enrol dose level base available safety PD data study , great 2-fold prior dose level . Phase 1b ( dose-escalation ) : In phase 1b/2 portion study , 12 patient enrol dose cohort , six patient administer omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) plus ipilimumab remain six administer rTA 408 plus nivolumab . Subsequent cohort ass escalate dos omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) administer combination ipilimumab nivolumab . Dose escalation decision base ongoing review available safety information enrol patient . Phase 2 : The Phase 2 portion study may include separate expansion cohort consist patient treat either combination therapy . Each expansion cohort include additional 24 patient enrol select Phase 2 dose level achieve total 30 patient omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) dose combination ipilimumab nivolumab .</brief_summary>
