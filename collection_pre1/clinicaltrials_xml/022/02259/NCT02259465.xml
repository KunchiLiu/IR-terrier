	<brief_summary>Some carbohydrate , complex sugar , find grain , fruit vegetable , digest human . When eaten pass small bowel large bowel , colon . Some bacteria live colon able digest carbohydrate , use energy source . This release energy human absorb , may effect health well . The process also release gas hydrogen methane colon , eventually release flatulence . There evidence animal , human , change carbohydrate content diet may increase number bacteria colon use energy source . Recent work look change colon bacteria carbohydrate diet affect transit , speed food stool move stomach bowel . This undergraduate project use technique Magnetic Resonance Imaging develop Nottingham investigate prolong change dietary carbohydrate might affect speed transit bowel gas production colon , whether immune reaction carbohydrate bowel wall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Low FODMAP Diet Dietary Oligofructose Gastrointestinal Form , Function Microbiota</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oligofructose ( OF ) fructose- base oligosaccharide define European Union dietary fibre . Enzymatically derive longer chain inulin chicory , commonly use process food improve mouth feel fat-free product . OF poorly digest absorbed small bowel pass colon ferment bacteria usually resident colon , term microbiota . This process produce gas hydrogen sometimes methane , short-chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) variety role include nutrition colonocytes , immunological effect modulation intestinal motility . Its presence colon alters composition microbiota , report potential benefit health , lead description 'prebiotic ' . Recently , however , poorly digest carbohydrate group together term FODMAP ( fermentable oligo- , di- , mono-saccharides polyols ) propose exacerbate symptom irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) abdominal discomfort bloating . Dietary exclusion food contain FODMAPs , wheat , dairy certain fruit vegetable , propose treatment IBS , evidence support . FODMAPs think induce symptom either draw water small bowel osmosis , gaseous distension large bowel combination along metabolite effect motility . The Nottingham GI MRI group forefront elucidate actual effect FODMAPs gastrointestinal ( GI ) physiology . We publish technique measure small bowel water content , colonic volume gas volume whole gut transit time . We recently demonstrate single , large ( 40g ) dose inulin lead increase colonic volume , mainly increase colonic gas . Such dose beyond usual range dietary variation , however . Last year pilot model similar dietary practice . Participants supplement usual diet 5g OF twice daily week . The striking result 18 % increase fast colonic volume . This could explain change colonic gas may represent proliferation , increase mass , microbiota . That study open label , uncontrolled case series wish test hypothesis double-blind , randomise control trial . For explanatory purpose also measure whole gut transit , colonic gas volume hydrogen methane expire breath . For exploratory purpose also collect stool urine sample allow assessment effect microbiota metabolic output .</detailed_description>
