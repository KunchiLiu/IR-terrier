	<brief_summary>Acid suppressive therapy ( AST ) use variety indication prevention treatment gastric acid relate disorder . In recent year , increase use acid suppressive therapy document . It generally accept agent effective safe . However , recently , report describe hypomagnesaemia , hypocalcemia , vitamin B12 deficiency enteric infection , publish . The goal study evaluate 1 ) many case long-term ambulatory treatment AST initiate hospital stay ( = ASTRA-1 ) , 2 ) ass appropriateness initiation AST appropriateness continuation AST discharge subset hospitalized patient population ( = ASTRA-2 ) . Finally , pharmacoeconomic impact inappropriate AST hospitalisation calculate data . The primary endpoint define number patient long-term ambulatory AST initiation hospital . Secondary endpoint appropriateness check AST level initiation hospitalization discharge ( appropriate continuation ) ; also impact hospital budget ( lump sum budget ) calculate , potential cost avoidance long-term ambulatory inappropriate AST estimate healthcare payer perspective period 1 , 3 , 6 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ASTRA 1 A retrospective , multi-centric , observational study carry 9 Belgian hospital . Patients recruit hospital wide participate hospital . All hospitalized adult patient ( define 18 year old moment discharge ) discharge participate hospital 01-07-2012 01-07-2013 include , treat moment hospitalization AST ( H2A , define drug belong ATC A02BA , PPI , define drug belong ATC A02BC ) . Younger patient exclude often treat compounded suspension preparation impossible match dispense medication . Fulfillment criterion base query retrieve data hospital information system . The query generate , participate hospital , list unique hospitalization . In order guaranty patient privacy , datasets make anonymous trusted third party ( see protocol ) . Reporting anonymous , never individual patient , physician hospital . For list , potentially interesting covariates document add cod patient-related data , order allow determination associate risk factor uni- multivariate analysis . The following patient-related information request HIS : number participate hospital , date admission discharge , age , weight , sex , region living , length stay , diagnosis admission , hospital outcome term mortality , comorbidity detail ( base ICD-9 cod ) , presence gastro ( duodenal ) investigation hospital stay ( eg . gastroscopy ) , discipline treat clinician and/or hospital ward . Patients multiple hospitalization inclusion period include . Each separate hospitalization count separate line database . Bias expect minimal long-term use AST exclude subsequent hospitalization period patient would naive AST admission . The sample size dataset limit ASTRA-1 order provide maximum power study , include minimum 5000 patient . The datasets , along covariates relate data , anonymized Custodix , Trusted Third Party , experience anonymizing hospital data . All anonymized datasets link trusted third party anonymized patient number anonymized IMS-database ambulatory dispense medication . All query perform anonymized set data combine patient covariates ambulatory consumption relevant medication . Patients long-term ambulatory AST ( define continue use &gt; 3 month ) without ambulatory use hospitalization one would like investigate primary endpoint analysis study . We determine number patient vs. discharge adult patient also vs. number adult patient AST treatment moment hospitalization . More detail , descriptive statistic carry use appropriate parametric non- parametric test ( Student t-test Mann-Whitney U-test , base distribution data ) describe demographic include patient . Patients divide 3 group : 1 ) patient AST admission ( whether therapy stop continued hospitalization ) , 2 ) patient start AST hospitalization stop discharge 3 ) patient start AST hospitalization continue use discharge . For patient group 3 , describe proportion patient use AST +1 , 3 , 6 12 month discharge , therefore group 3 subdivide along proportion . To investigate potential risk factor correlate long-term use , group 2 3 compare use uni- multivariate analysis evaluate associate risk factor age , sex , weight , comorbidities , type ward , concomitant medication . A subgroup comparison group 2 3 ( b+c+d ) carry discuss risk factor associate continued long-term use . Statistical analysis carry SPSS SAS investigator collaboration L-Biostat ( KU Leuven ) . Based dataset estimate cost AST healthcare payer perspective calculate use list price ( = public price ) 01-07-2013 involve medication . In combination result ASTRA-2 impact parameter like percent appropriateness , duration therapy , diagnosis comorbidities study multivariate analysis . As main dataset ASTRA-2 come UZ Leuven , participate hospital request review 20 medical file hospital order investigate possible extrapolation bias support finding . ASTRA 2 A retrospective , non-interventional , multi-centric study carry participate hospital . Patients recruit hospital wide participate hospital . The main number inclusion University hospital Leuven , inclusion participate hospital use investigate possible extrapolation bias support finding . All hospitalized patient discharge participate hospital 01-07-2012 01-07-2013 include . Exclusion decease patient , juvenile patient ( define younger 18 year time discharge ) , critically ill patient , patient without startup AST patient without AST discharge lead subgroup subject research . An overview inclusion process give figure 8 . Patients admit ICU , hospitalization , include literature concern use AST ( especially SUP ) ICU set ( critically ill patient ) already exhaustive 3,15 . Startup initiation AST hospitalization define treatment H2A ( ATC-classification A02BA ) PPI ( ATC-classification A02BC ) start day 3 late hospitalization period . Patients H2A/PPI treatment hospitalization exclude AST initiated hospital . The patient inclusion perform base query retrieve data hospital information system ( admission discharge data ) CPOE ( AST prescription ) participate hospital . When patient readmitted hospital study period , different hospitalization evaluate separately . Assessment appropriateness AST perform medical record review train staff pharmacist participate hospital , assist close supervision master student Faculty Pharmaceutical Sciences , lead validated procedure . The method review subject interrater validity evaluation use kappa-statistic . The sole intend record review gather data use appropriateness AST medication intervene way therapy patient - physician relationship . Reporting anonymous , never individual patient , physician hospital . The estimated prevalence inappropriate AST unknown . Assuming bad case scenario 50 % inappropriate AST , 384 patient would need included trial confidence interval 95 % ( see table ) . Assuming rate 30 % inappropriate AST , 323 patient would need include . To guarantee sample size least 500 medical file screen order compensate potential dropout . These 500 medical file randomly select include patient use random code generator . In UZ Leuven least 500 medical record screen , supplementary participate hospital request screen 20 medical file . To guarantee representative sample study population sample check proportional allocation baseline variable sex ( male/female ) , age ( minus 65 year old ) admission label ( internal surgical ) . In order prevent selection bias use random sample stratify allocation plan intervention group . Factors justify AST non-critically ill hospitalize patient base literature review use evaluation appropriateness pinpoint risk factor inappropriate longterm use AST hospitalisation . The impact cost saving hospital population study healthcare-payer perspective . Therefore official list price acquisition , equal reimbursement price hospitalize patient , 01-07-2013 hospital use . In case inappropriate therapy late IV/PO switch opportunity cost saving . This subject sensitivity analysis . Besides direct cost saving may possible long term cost-avoidance , difficult calculate side-effects long term therapy pop research monetize yet . Extrapolation percentage patient inappropriate AST hospital inappropriate continue long-term use perform combine result ASTRA-1 ASTRA-2 . In way impact cost healthcare payer perspective calculate . In analysis also look patient compliance , switch less expensive product perform sensitivity analysis cost save function timely stop inappropriate therapy .</detailed_description>
