	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation determine safety preliminary efficacy implant cochlear implant ( CI ) profoundly deaf ear adult one normal hearing ( NH ) ear ( term `` single-sided deaf '' person , SSD ) . The potential subject deafen post-lingually , thus , one point deafen ear conduct sound periphery . The MED-EL CI system implant ten ( 10 ) SSD patients.The long-term goal research program determine whether CI , combination NH ear , may provide improved localization ability well speech understand noise , relative performance cochlear implantation ( i.e. , NH ear alone ) . A secondary long-term goal determine whether CI stimulation may reduce tinnitus severity , compare tinnitus experience prior cochlear implantation CI turn , implantation .</brief_summary>
