	<brief_summary>The objective study develop test new decision aid -named Patient Centered Outcome Aid ( PCOA ) -that allow patient assimilate information identify trade-offs impact IP/IV therapy versus IV-only therapy QOL survival , base preference personal clinical characteristic , describe term meaningful . To accomplish , investigator 1 ) develop PCOA , patient- provider-friendly decision aid 2 ) test effectiveness PCOA randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The investigator hypothesize PCOA significantly well usual care , result patient report satisfaction treatment decision , less decision regret , good quality life , satisfaction care compare similar patient access PCOA .

	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer typically diagnose advanced stage carry high fatality-to-case ratio gynecologic malignancy diagnose United States . Arguably effective treatment regimen date provide intraperitoneal ( IP ) chemotherapy delivery , together intravenous ( IV ) chemotherapy , recent phase III randomize trial confer long median survival ( 65.6 month ) ever report advanced ovarian cancer , compare 49.7 month IV-only treatment arm . However , active treatment , patient randomize IP therapy group report significantly bad quality life ( QOL ) , treatment-related toxicity . In short , woman less likely die receive IP component chemotherapy , find underscored NCI Clinical Alert . However , may great toxicity IP treatment . The tradeoff short-term reduced QOL longer survival difficult patient understand incorporate meaningfully decision-making process . In fact , reason entirely clear , many patient offer IP therapy . Patient-centered care require give opportunity participate treatment decision-making .</detailed_description>
