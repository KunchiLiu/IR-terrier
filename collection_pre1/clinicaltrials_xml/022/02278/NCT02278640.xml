	<brief_title>Harmonic ACE®+7 Shears Laparoscopic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population : Subjects enrol study undergo elective total laparoscopic hysterectomy benign indication wherein dissection transection uterine vasculature indicate . Primary Variables : Percentage subject achieve hemostasis name vessel/pedicle ( UA UP ) leave side . Percentage subject achieve hemostasis name vessel/pedicle ( UA UP ) right side . Definition : Hemostasis name vessel pedicle dichotomous variable ( i.e . yes ) . `` Yes '' define hemostatic transection uterine vasculature ( left / right ) least one use device Advanced Hemostasis mode ( complete cycle second activation tone heard ) without use additional hemostatic measure ( i.e . tissue sealer , cautery device , hemoclips , staple , suture , fibrin sealant , etc . ) Harmonic ACE®+7 device . Note : Multiple application Advanced Hemostasis mode and/or additional application device maximum ( MAX ) minimum ( MIN ) mode allow . Secondary Endpoints : Percentage subject achieve hemostasis OP leave and/or right side . If study procedure also include transection seal one OPs , hemostasis leave and/or right OP also record . Hemostasis OP dichotomous variable ( i.e . yes ) . `` Yes '' define hemostatic transection ovarian vasculature ( left and/or right ) least one use device Advanced Hemostasis mode ( complete cycle second activation tone heard ) without use additional hemostatic measure ( i.e . tissue sealer , cautery device , hemoclips , staple , suture , fibrin sealant , etc. ) . Note : Multiple application Advanced Hemostasis mode device MAX MIN mode allow . Exploratory endpoint include : Requirement additional measure obtain hemostasis name vessel/pedicle ( UA UP and/or OP ) leave right side Use energy device ( tissue sealer , cautery device ) - Graded yes ; `` yes '' , name type , time application ( 24 hour clock ) . Use additional hemostatic product ( e.g . hemoclips , staple , suture , fibrin sealant ) - Graded yes ; `` yes '' , name type , number/volume , time application ( 24 hour clock ) . Complications associate vaginal cuff heal include dehiscence separation , infection , cellulitis , abscess , inflammation , granulation associate suture use part study . Adverse event attribute study device procedure collect time surgery Visit 4 ( Approximately 4 6 week study surgery per standard care ( SOC ) ) . No formal sample size determination require study . Approximately 40 subject United States European Union plan enrol study . Global indication use The Harmonic ACE®+7 , 5mm Diameter Shears Advanced Hemostasis : Indicated soft tissue incision bleed control minimal thermal injury desire . The instrument use adjunct substitute electrosurgery , laser steel scalpel general , plastic , pediatric , gynecologic , urologic , thoracic , exposure orthopedic structure ( spine joint space ) , seal transection lymphatic vessel , open endoscopic procedure . The instrument allow coagulation vessel include 7mm diameter , use Advanced Hemostasis function .</detailed_description>
