	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial compare enzalutamide standard androgen deprivation therapy reduce incidence metabolic syndrome patient prostate cancer spread place body . Metabolic syndrome define change cholesterol , blood pressure , circulate sugar level , body weight . Previous study show patient prostate cancer , treat standard medical therapy lower testosterone level , increase risk change . Hormone therapy use enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer block use testosterone tumor cell instead lower testosterone level . It yet know whether prostate cancer patient receive enzalutamide reduce incidence metabolic syndrome patient receive standard androgen deprivation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine incidence metabolic syndrome within 12 month , define Adult Treatment Panel III , patient treat enzalutamide compare standard androgen deprivation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine incidence metabolic syndrome within 6 month , define Adult Treatment Panel III , patient treat enzalutamide compare standard androgen deprivation therapy . II . To assess bone health , measure dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scanner . III . To assess body composition ( sarcopenic obesity ) , measure DXA scanner . IV . To assess quality life ( QOL ) , measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ( FACT-P ) Sexual Health Inventory Men ( SHIM ) . V. To assess time prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression time radiographic progression . VI . To assess incidence develop individual risk factor , component , comprise metabolic syndrome . VII . To assess change high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) marker inflammation . VIII . To assess safety tolerance enzalutamide androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . IX . To assess change physical function measure Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive standard care ADT comprise one follow discretion treat physician : leuprolide acetate , goserelin acetate , histrelin acetate , triptorelin , degarelix subcutaneously ( SC ) intramuscularly ( IM ) 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may also choose undergo surgical castration alternative form ADT . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
