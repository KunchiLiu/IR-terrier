	<brief_summary>Recent evidence magnetoencephalographic ( MEG ) study ASD point abnormality ( specifically , delay ) auditory evoke neuromagnetic response ( e.g . M100 - see Roberts et al. , 2010 , mismatch field , MMF - see Roberts et al. , 2011 ) well abnormalities oscillatory behavior auditory cortex , especially gamma band ( 30-50Hz ) , rest response simple auditory stimulus ( see Gandal et al. , 2010 Cornew et al. , 2012 ; Edgar et al. , 2013 ) . The local circuitry underlie evoked activity oscillation , synaptic transmission general , require appropriate balance excitation inhibition , mediate glutamate GABA , respectively . One model neural oscillatory deficit ASD suggest impaired regulatory control inhibitory interneurons onto pyramidal cell underlies abnormal auditory latency oscillatory electrophysiological measure . As , electrophysiological deficit interpret term local circuitry abnormality , inference molecular level imbalance activity glutamate GABA . A candidate therapeutic ASD develop - STX209 , GABA-B agonist . Since pharmaceutical target synaptic activity clear electrophysiological correlate , one goal proposal assess responsiveness ( sensitivity change ) MEG measure acute administration STX209 various dos adolescent autism spectrum . The study also aim establish nature putative relationship electrophysiologic marker GABA glutamate level use MEGAPRESS spectrally-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) .</brief_summary>
