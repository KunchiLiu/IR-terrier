	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study I-131-CLR1404 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable , monoclonal proliferation plasma cell . Approximately 80,000 Americans affect MM approximately 22,000 new case diagnose 11,000 death year . The introduction newer therapy past twenty year , autologous stem cell transplantation novel agent proteasome inhibitor immune modulate drug improve outcomes , current median overall survival estimate 3-10 year depend number patient- , disease- treatment-related factor . However , despite innovation , myeloma relapse inevitable . Therefore , clear need improve therapy MM , particular , relapsed disease . I-131-CLR1404 radioiodinated therapeutic exploit selective uptake retention phospholipid ether ( PLEs ) malignant cell . Cellectar Biosciences ' novel cancer-targeted small-molecule compound ( CLR1404 ) radiolabeled isotope iodine-131 ( I-131 ) . Radioiodinated CLR1404 evaluate 60 xenograft spontaneous ( transgenic ) tumor model . In two case hepatocellular carcinoma , CLR1404 demonstrate selective cancer cell uptake retention . In various rodent tumor model , I-131-CLR1404 also demonstrate tumor growth delay prolongation survival . Based critical unmet medical need effective agent novel mechanisms action MM , exquisite radiosensitivity MM , initial preclinical clinical experience radioiodinated CLR1404 , Cellectar Biosciences choose assess I-131-CLR1404 MM-specific phase 1 trial .</detailed_description>
