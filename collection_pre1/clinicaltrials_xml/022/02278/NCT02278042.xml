	<brief_title>A Comparison Neurocognitive Metabolic Effects Fructose , Glucose , High Fructose Corn Syrup Sucrose Normal Population Consumed Levels Adults Ages 20-60 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed description ( Why How ? ) Fructose know metabolize differently common monosaccharide . In addition well know lipogenic effect , recent evidence show acute change hormone metabolic parameter control appetite energy regulation fructose consumption may promote caloric overconsumption , long-term , weight gain deterioration insulin sensitivity . However , fructose rarely consume isolation , instead consume combination sugar ( glucose case two common source fructose : high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) sucrose , part mixed macronutrient meal . As , practical significance short-term finding isolate monosaccharide consumption limit . AIM 1 : investigate response ten week daily consumption typical level different fructose contain sugar glucose measure glucose insulin metabolism . AIM 2 : To investigate whether ten week daily consumption change fat content liver , skeletal muscle abdomen .</detailed_description>
