	<brief_summary>Aims study While various communication aid evaluate separately , study take coordinated approach combine aid different goal evaluate combine impact . In study investigator use two communication aid ; QPL audio record consultation . QPLs include question concern treatment option , study involve QPLs explore whether QPLs result patient take active role consultation . To knowledge study objectively try explore whether patient receive QPLs participates share decision making great extent , except one ongoing Italian trial breast cancer patient . To explore describe communication aid QPL audio record consultation improve first doctor-patient consultation oncology outpatient clinic 1 . Encouraging patients/caregivers ask question , particularly sensitive topic prognosis ( effect QPL alone ) 2 . Increasing share decision-making ( effect QPL alone ) 3 . Improving overall satisfaction consultation information retrieve ( effect communication aid ) 4 . Affecting quality life/anxiety/depression ( effect communication aid )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods/study plan 1 . Translation QPL Norwegian 2 . Reference group 3 . Pilot project 4 . RCT 1 . Translation Question Prompt List ( QPL ) evaluation Norwegian version This QPL consist list 49 question cover 9 topic yet use Norway translated Norwegian . Our collaborate partner , professor Phyllis Butow professor Martin Tattersal Centre Medical Psychology Evidence-based Decision-making University Sydney develop several QPLs different setting . In collaboration prof. Butow colleague select QPL `` Questions ask medical radiation oncologist '' consider suitable consultation outpatient oncology clinic University hospital North Norway translate Norwegian . The translation QPL do 5 step use European organization research treatment cancer ( EORTC ) gold-standard approach 1 . Two independent translator Norwegian mother tongue translate QPL English Norwegian . 2 . Merge two translation discussion two translator study coordinator . 3 . Back translation English independent third translator . 4 . Discussion translation committee researcher clinician . The version agree prefinal version . The Norwegian version QPL The Norwegian QPL must culturally sensitive Norwegian speaking cancer patient may question Australian QPL relevant Norwegian condition . The investigator arrange approximately 3 focus group 6-10 experienced cancer patient former cancer patient provide information question lack Australian version question might exclude Norwegian version . Patients participate nationwide survey `` Outpatient experience cancer clinic Norway 2011 '' report lack information side effect treatment , lack information pain / pain relief . Due result researcher want discus weather add question QPL , regard side effect treatment pain/ pain treatment member focus group . 5 . Discussion information retrieve focus group committee researcher clinician change might do prefinal version . 6 . Test prefinal Norwegian version ( might alter focus group ) approximately 30 experienced cancer patient . The patient invite give opinion prompt question . The investigator ask grade question accord : 1 . Usefulness 2 . Clarity 3 . The amount discomfort question would generate The patient also ask suggest additional question important issue miss . The experienced cancer patient 4 ) 6 ) recruit Vardesenteret . In addition , investigator want make small change design leave space front prompt question patient make question suggest study Voltz . 2 . Reference group There may culturally differences Australian Norwegian cancer patient . As study use QPLs audio record do Norwegian cancer patient , investigator need reference group study Norwegian cancer patient general participate first consultation oncologist extend Norwegian patient involve decision making . The investigator plan record 30 consecutive first time consultation cancer patient receive QPL reference group count question issue discuss consultation code consultation accord Option scale . They also ask fill inn one questionnaire baseline characteristic information retrieve . The reference group necessary able calculate sample size participant need RCT . The patient receive write information consultation also contact phone prior consultation agree participate sign write consent . 3 . Pilot study ( Interim analyse ) Before start RCT study concept test pilot study . These patient receive write information consultation also contact phone prior consultation . 30 consecutive cancer patient first consultation outpatient clinic provide QPL audio file consultation . These patient encourage oncologist ask question standard statement . They also receive questionnaire use RCT ( see ) . The investigator also conduct train oncologist prior pilot study ensure encourage use QPL standard manner . 4 . RCT This single center , randomize control trial oncology outpatient clinic University hospital North Norway . The clinic situate separate part cancer department serve specialist oncology junior doctor train . The consultation length usually 40-60 minute first time consultation . Participants - Study design All patient refer oncology outpatient clinic meet inclusion criterion invite participate study along letter first appointment . There approximately 15 new referral every week . If agree participate sign write informed consent , patient randomize intervention control arm ( see ) . Participants group ask fill questionnaire detect baseline characteristic , anxiety/depression wish share decision-making ( control preference scale ) . Patients intervention group receive QPL home advance consultation along information clinic . All specialist oncology also junior physician least one year train oncology invite participate . The doctor instruct address QLP standardize way early consultation possible . They also ask encourage use QPL consultation within two month period , patient ask fill questionnaire ( see ) one week two month first consultation . The consultation record control intervention group . The record do computer , patient intervention group give record immediately consultation memory stick . For group audiotape analyze standard procedure ( see ) . Endpoint RCT Primary endpoint Difference number question ask , especially concern prognosis . Secondary endpoint Difference share decision making . Difference anxiety/depression/health relate quality life . Difference satisfaction consultation information retrieve . Analysis audio record consultation Our collaborator Sydney develop manual cod sheet enable standardization cod procedure consultation `` Question prompt list '' .This translate Norwegian . The audio recording transcribe patient question concern count categorize accord topic cover QPL . Physician endorsement QPL cod either absent , basic extend . The coder also train use `` Option scale '' score patient involvement decision making . The option scale consist 12 dimension collaborative decision make process dimension register frequency . The coder blind group allocation . Intra-rater inter-rater reliability test . Training coder guidance Prof. Svein Bergsvik collaboration Prof. Butow . The coder probably 2nd year student psychology follow project three year period pay hourly basis . Sample size calculation To calculate sample size study , investigator need know average number question ask Norwegian cancer patient general . The investigator get information reference group . In absence data Norway , investigator assume Australia study report mean number 9 question ( range 0-53 ) . A sample size calculation suggest need n=80 patient group order 80 % power detect significance difference group anticipate mean difference group 3 standard deviation 5 use 5 % significance level . Randomization Patients randomly assign stratified age , sex , education , type cancer ( breast cancer v non-breast cancer ) curative palliative treatment intention . The randomization do conceal , computer- generate randomization procedure . As doctor meet patient intervention control arm , must take consideration either randomization statistical analyzes . Statistical analysis Analysis intention treat , use available data randomly assign patient accord group assignment . Comparison group perform use chi-square test logistic regression binary variable two sample t-test linear regression model continuous variable . Data analyze use SPSS version 19 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois ) SAS version 9.2 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .</detailed_description>
