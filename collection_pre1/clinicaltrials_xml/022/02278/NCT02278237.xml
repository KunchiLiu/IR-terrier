	<brief_summary>Asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) result million hospitalization United States annually1 COPD third lead cause 30-day re-hospitalizations.2 Clinical trial establish efficacy treatment primarily dispense via respiratory inhaler device reduce morbidity health care utilization use correctly.3-4 Unfortunately , effectiveness medication real-world setting limit fact patient often use inhaler correctly.5-6 Current guideline recommend assess teach inhaler technique health care encounter , include hospitalization.77.5 My work find 75 % hospitalized patient urban , predominantly underserved population misuse respiratory inhaler , highlight miss opportunity educate patient high potential benefit.8 Hospitalization , therefore , provide potential 'teachable moment ' correct misuse.9 My preliminary data indicate one strategy , in-person teach-to-goal ( TTG ) , effective teach hospitalized patient proper inhaler technique effective simple verbal instruction.10 While TTG promise method improve care patient use inhaler , several limitation prevent widespread adoption . First , TTG rely in-person assessment education , well train monitor instructor ensure fidelity , make time-consuming costly . Also , single educational session ensure long-term retention,11-12 post-discharge reinforcement may need , may impractical in-person TTG . One potential method surmount TTG 's limitation use interactive video module education ( VME ) , method use health education clinical contexts.13-14 Through iterative self-assessments video-demonstrations tablet computer , VME potential less costly , maintain fidelity , easily extend post-discharge set in-person TTG . However , certain question remain VME . It unclear whether VME yield similar result compare TTG , whether urban , underserved patient ability , willing use , VME post-discharge setting . Therefore , widespread implementation VME , critical rigorously develop test VME inhaler education hospital set . Ultimately , also important understand patient ' ability willingness use post-discharge VME educational reinforcement allow strategy transition patient across care setting hospital home . Through funded project , I acquire critical data I need develop R-01 study focus improve self-management patient obstructive pulmonary disease across care transition . We hypothesize interactive VME lead non-inferior rate ability demonstrate correct inhaler use compare rate TTG among hospitalized patient Asthma COPD . For study test preliminary efficacy VME teach respiratory inhaler technique prior implement large RCT test comparative effectiveness VME versus TTG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim test hypothesis : To iteratively test VME teach correct use meter dose inhaler ( MDIs ) dry-powder DiskusÂ® device hospitalize patient Asthma COPD . We partner software development company develop VME module ( self ) -assess teach respiratory inhaler technique hospitalize participant . We test VME focus group . Now VME develop iteratively pilot test ( n=30-40 ) VME strategy ( 3 round ( 90-120 total ) ) obtain important patient feedback , preference preliminary efficacy estimate module . We hypothesize participant ' post-VME inhaler technique significantly well pre-VME inhaler technique .</detailed_description>
