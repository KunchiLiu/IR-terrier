	<brief_title>Non-invasive Measurement Brain Oxygen Levels People With Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator study effect electrical stimulation subthalamic nucleus frontal cerebral perfusion 10 patient advanced PD already undergone successful STN DBS ( Medtronic , Inc. , Minneapolis , MN ) surgery evidence 20 % great improvement Unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) motor sub-score ( UPDRS-III ) stimulation v , three month surgery . The UPDRS-III widely employ validate rating scale Parkinson 's disease symptom severity base neurological examination . For purpose study , movement disorder neurologist perform neurological assessment . Patients must also demonstrate cognitively intact evidence Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) Score 24 great . This experimental study compare frontal cerebral perfusion ( measure non-invasively NIRS device ) UPDRS-III score ( determined neurological examination ) four clinical state : medication off/stimulation ; medication off/stimulation ; medication on/stimulation ; medication on/stimulation . The primary question answer : Can detect significant change cerebral perfusion NIRS device response subthalamic stimulation deliver via implant DBS device ? This pilot study conduct 10 PD patient undergone successful DBS surgery past . The study complete one day detail take 6 hour complete . Patients arrive movement disorder center morning schedule study visit discontinue medication night ( 12 hour 'off '' ) . They arrive stimulators set therapeutic parameter . Dr. Shih perform neurological examination determine UPDRS-III score , med/on stim state . In order perform NIRS/perfusion measurement subject fit multipart plastic helmet , hold number optical fiber surface subject 's head . This helmet adjust fit comfortably . Additional probe position finger order monitor peripheral blood oxygenation ( i.e . pulse oximetry ) ensure change observe cerebral perfusion due change brain physiology , general physiological factor . The fiber connect 32 low power infrared laser diode . The power emit laser far typical maximum permissible exposure ( MPE ) level skin exposure laser beam , indicate American National Standards Institute , subject feel effect . The laser light point top head , risk eye . The initial cerebral perfusion measurement make . The patient 's DBS device turn 60 min allow pas , allow washout clinical CBF effect DBS . During time , cerebral oxygenation monitor document every five minute . At end period UPDRS-III score determine ( meds/off stim ) record , confirm washout clinical effect . The DBS turn employ setting employ therapy except stimulation frequency set 20Hz , low frequency know therapeutically effective PD . All setting maintain constant . Again , cerebral oxygenation record every 5 min 60 min UPDRS-III score record The DBS reprogrammed patient 's steady state therapeutic setting , cerebral oxygenation record every 5 min 60 min , end 60 min period UPDRS-III score record , complete stimulation/off medication evaluation . The patient instruct take his/her usual dose medication , send lunch one hour . After lunch , patient return medication/on stimulation state , NIRS pulse oximetry probe reapplied , process describe medication state repeat medication state . After medication assessment complete patient send home his/her device set therapeutic parameter .</detailed_description>
