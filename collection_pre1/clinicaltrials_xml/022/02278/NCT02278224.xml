	<detailed_description>Background rationale The aim present study compare effectiveness rumination-focused cognitive behavior therapy vs. cognitive behavior therapy treatment depression . Understanding mechanism involve effective cognitive behavioural therapy key focus clinical research ( Watkins , 2009 ) . The study investigate possible underlying mechanism rumination thereby provide insight information processing symptom depression . Rumination , process recurrent negative thinking dwell negative affect , common residual symptom ( Kim , Yu , Lee , &amp; Kim , 2012 ; Riso et al. , 2003 ) . Rumination evidence crucial vulnerability depression ( Smith &amp; Alloy , 2009 ) , predict onset , severity duration future depression ( Nolen-Hoeksema , 2000 ) . Such knowledge indicate rumination key factor involve initiation maintenance depressive symptom . Individuals display high level rumination even currently present depressive symptom may therefore increase risk develop future depression . Consequently , involved pathogenesis depression , rumination may constitute active ingredient psychological intervention . Hence , intervention explicitly target rumination may improve efficiency CBT recurrent chronic depression ( Watkins , 2009 ) . However , study test intervention target rumination , exception Watkins ( 2007 ; 2011 ) . Cognitive theory argue information processing bias influence aetiology maintenance depression . On test cognitive performance , particularly attention memory repeatedly report affected depression ( Goeleven , De Raedt , Baert , &amp; Koster , 2006 ) . Depressed individual show negative bias perception facial emotion , acute phase well remission ( Bouhuys , Geerts , &amp; Gordijn , 1999 ) , display difficulty disengage negative stimulus ( Koster , De Raedt , Goeleven , Franck , &amp; Crombez , 2005 ) . It suggest literature depressed people able gain control emotional influence negative stimulus due dysfunctional inhibition negative stimulus ( Donaldson , Lam , &amp; Mathews , 2007 ) . This idea substantiate strong relationship rumination depression suggest impaired inhibitory function may underlie mechanism rumination . However , experimental paradigm use study attention , apart Donaldson colleague ( 2007 ) , apply rumination self-report measure assess attention attentional control clinical sample . The present study investigate relationship clinical feature depression self-reported tendency ruminate response negative affect , well experience attentional control actual performance cognitive test assess attentional control . Furthermore combine clinical self-report test performance , study address potentially underlie mechanisms rumination . Understanding mechanism involve effective cognitive behavioural therapy thus key focus clinical research ( Watkins , 2009 ) . RFCBT compare CBT depression . Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) recommend treatment depression National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) UK . Group CBT effective treatment depression , however , one third patient respond satisfactorily ( McDermut , Miller , &amp; Brown , 2001 ) , relapse rate around 30 % report several study ( Butler , Chapman , Forman , &amp; Beck , 2006 ) . Residual symptom follow treatment common problem , 30-50 % remitted patient present residual symptom end treatment ( Kennedy &amp; Paykel , 2004 ) . These patient display depressive symptom , low level social function utilize health care service ( Cornwall &amp; Scott , 1997 ) compare fully remit patient . Objectives : The aim present study compare effectiveness rumination-focused CBT vs. CBT treatment depression . Trial design : The design pragmatic block randomize control blinded trial compare two type group base cognitive behavioural therapy depression . Study design : The study take place community psychiatric outpatient service Hillerød , Denmark , receive 200-250 patient depression per year . Patients refer treatment Psychiatric Outpatient Centre Hillerød primary diagnosis depression , recurrent chronic , recruit study . We plan recruit total 128 patient , 64 treatment type . Intake take place July 2013 Marts 2015 . Therapists conduct group therapy train experienced cognitive behavioural therapist least 4 year experience CBT . The therapist conduction group RFCBT train supervise professor Ed Watkins ( affiliation ) . Both intervention run 11 week 3 hour session week deliver trained clinician least two year experience CBT . Preceding first group session participant give individual session group therapist prepare groupbased treatment . The psychiatrist conduct initial evaluation patient invite patient participate inclusion criterion meet . The patient receive verbal write information project psychiatrist . If interested participation patient contact Ph.D. student sign inform consent invite first assessment . After assessment patient finally randomise computer method receive one two treatment type . Primary outcome : Primary outcome post-treatment assessment Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD ) Bech P , Kastrup M , Rafaelsen OJ . ( 1986 ) . Secondary outcome : Post-treatment measure HAM-D-6 ( Bech et al. , 1975 ) , Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ; Meyer , Miller , Metzger , &amp; Borkovec , 1990 ) , Ruminative Response Scale Response Style Questionnaire ( RRS ; ( Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow , 1991 ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 ( GAD-7 ; Spitzer , et al . 2006 ) . Trail-making A B ( Strauss et al . 2006 ) , Dot-probe task -computerized test cognitive control emotional processing ( Donaldson et al. , 2007 ) . Sample size estimation : Assuming similar mean change HRSD score pre-to-post intervention find Watkins colleague [ 18 ] RFCBT ( M = 7.81 ) Paykel colleague [ 11 ] CBT ( M = 3.52 ) , conservative estimate pool standard deviation change HRSD 6 ( SD= 3.60 change HRSD RFCBT ) , estimate between-treatment effect size Cohen 's = 0.7 . To detect difference effect size 0.7 RFCBT CBT two-tailed significance level 5 % , treatment arm require 44 patient obtain 90 % statistical power [ 40 ] . Assuming dropout rate 20 % , recruit 55 patient treatment arm . With average size therapy group = 8 treatment arm , intraclass correlation ρ = 0.05 , design effect 1 + ( - 1 ) ρ = 1.35 follow , plan recruit 8 group treatment arm ( 128 patient total ) . Statistical analysis : The primary outcome post-treatment score HRSD , treat continuous , normally distribute variable . The primary efficacy hypothesis test use multilevel two-group comparison ( RFCBT vs. CBT ) , Group main effect , Therapy Group random intercept , HRSD baseline score continuous covariate . The test perform 5 % two-tailed significance level . The primary test efficacy base intention-to-treat population , randomize patient enter analysis set , multiple imputation miss value primary endpoint [ 42 ] . For secondary outcome , similar analysis use , take consideration scale variable ( e.g. , logistic regression binary outcome ) . Ethical consideration : The patient inform research project purpose project prior participation ask informed consent . There side effect due rumination focus cognitive behavioral therapy . It possible pay patient participate research project . Participant leave treatment request . If anyone involve trial get knowledge increase risk suicide among participant relevant prevention initiate . The participant give treatment usual , clinical management medical treatment need assessed highly trained psychiatrist PCN . The project approve Danish national ethical scientific committee register The Danish Data Protection Agency Region Hovedstaden Psychiatry ( casenumber H-1-2013-049 ) .</detailed_description>
