	<brief_summary>Total knee joint replacement surgery lead significant blood loss , affect recovery surgery . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) medication stop breakdown blood clot therefore prevents blood loss . The optimal use TXA remain point debate . Growing interest topical application TXA ( directly surgical wound ) suggest alternative way administer TXA , may demonstrate similar effectiveness give intravenously . Therefore , multicentred , randomize control trial , aim investigate safety effectiveness topical intravenous administration TXA total knee joint surgery . The investigator predict route administration demonstrate similar result compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative anaemia follow elective arthroplasty lead prolong hospital stay , delay rehabilitation often poorly tolerate patient cardiovascular disease . ( 1 ) Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) arthroplasty use many orthopaedic surgeon reduce perioperative blood loss subsequent transfusion blood product elective total hip knee arthroplasty ( THA TKA ) . In several review , systemic TXA ( sTXA ) significantly reduce blood loss transfusion rate compare placebo , without increase risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . ( 2-4 ) The CRASH-2 study , 20,000 randomise trauma patient , also confirm efficacy safety TXA setting , particularly give early . ( 5 ) The evidence use date overwhelming contraindicate , employ arthroplasty unit part standard practice . However , despite vast evidence use arthroplasty surgeon remain cautious safety profile give systemically . TXA synthetic derivative lysine responsible binding reversibly plasminogen effectively inhibiting clot degradation . ( 6 ) Although , clot promoting , inhibit clot breakdown theoretically may increase likelihood clot formation . This real concern surgeon patient previous VTE . For reason , surgeon utilise TXA topical application directly surgical field reduce systemic absorption avoid VTE . ( 7 , 8 ) TXA administer topically TKA also report reduce swell may advantage early mobility less pain . ( 9 ) In cardiac surgery , TXA tout blood conserving property via coagulation pathway also reduce inflammation via attenuation pro-inflammatory cascade . ( 10 , 11 ) Based rationale , appear sensible reasonable route administration TXA population . However , surgeon ensure avoid place undue risk patient alter use TXA give strong evidence sTXA . Therefore , purpose study ass whether topical TXA effective reduce blood loss knee joint replacement surgery , safe effective systemic TXA .</detailed_description>
