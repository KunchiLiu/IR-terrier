	<detailed_description>Our study randomise clinical trial 6-month follow-up Mexican adult men woman ( 20-65 year ) Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) . The individual invite participate poster social network advertising . The study conduct two Mexican clinic ( Mexico City Cuernavaca ) obesity metabolic disorder , use Mexican National Institute Public Health ( INSP ) recruitment center . The sample size calculate use formula compare two mean , alpha 0.05 power 95 % . Based calculation , establish baseline sample 118 adult . For diagnosis MS , use classification International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) , therefore participant require three follow criterion : ) waist circumference ≥90 cm men ≥80 cm woman , b ) triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL , c ) high density lipoprotein ( HDL-cholesterol ) &lt; 40 mg/dL men &lt; 50 mg/dL woman , ) blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg ; e ) fast glucose ≥100 mg/dL . Exclusion criterion include bariatric surgery weight loss , smoking , use alcohol drug , psychiatric disorder , anti-obesity medication , soy protein intolerance , woman use birth control method , pregnant lactating , body weight gain loss great two percent three month prior start study . To achieve baseline sample 118 adult , 150 patient screen ; however , 32 exclude meet criterion . During screening , individual interested participate receive explanation study design give sufficient time consider inclusion clinical trial complete form inform consent . On day consent , doctor write medical history ; nutritionist conduct anthropometry ( weight , height , waist circumference ) ; nurse measure blood pressure withdraw venous blood determination glucose , triglyceride , HDL-cholesterol . After medical evaluation nutritional status , provide meal replacement enrich soy protein consume follow two day , test soy protein tolerance . Each clinic supervisor enrol participant , study coordinator conduct randomization sequencing assign participant intervention . After randomly assign one two group , control group receive diet low protein content ( 0.8gr/kg body weight ) , intervention group receive diet high protein content ( 1.34gr/kg body weight ) . Both diet equal amount calorie , equivalent type carbohydrate , caloric restriction 500 calorie less rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) base Harris-Benedict´s formula . The overall study design show Figure 1 . For intervention group , meal replacement ( drink bar ) make soy protein , indivi-dualized menu , control content calorie , protein , carbohydrate , fat , control total amount protein consume daily . After randomization ( week 0 ) , participant receive specific diet instruction . Each month , diet contain 15 different option sufficient meet need micronutrient recommend US Institute Medicine ( recommend dietary intake ) accord age sex . In intervention group , participant consume two , protein-enriched drink , contribute daily protein intake ( 1.34g protein/kg body weight ) along conventional food two low-fat bar . Used substitute food , protein-enriched drink prepare 250ml either milk 1.5 % fat water . The nutritional content protein-enriched drink milk contain 145 calorie , 9g protein , 3g fat , 20.5g carbohydrate . For water , nutritional content protein-enriched drink contain 22 calorie , 5g protein , 0.2g fat , 0g carbohydrate . In control group , participant eat three meal two snack daily intake 0.8g protein/kg body weight . For group , calorie density diet adjust baseline metabolic rate participant restriction 500kcal/day . Measurements Previously train standard procedure , nutritionist complete monthly documentation food frequency questionnaires participants´ total caloric intake gram protein consume per day . To minimize error , nutritionist participant scrutinize discuss food diary . The nutritionist also conduct anthropometry ( weight waist circumference ) baseline three six month , use internationally recognize technique . [ 14 ] The weight body composition measure Analyzer Avis 333 , waist circumference measure tape measure , use line low costal border iliac crest reference point . At baseline , height measure wall stadiometer ( SECA Model 222 ) accuracy 0.1cm . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight/height 2 . Nurses measure blood pressure 10 minute rest digital sphygmomanometer ( OMRON HEM-907 ) , follow recommendation American Heart Association . Blood sample draw 9- 12-hour fasting process without delay . Laboratory test include result metabolic syndrome HDL-cholesterol , insulin , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , direct bilirubin indirect bilirubin . All measurement perform Mexican National Institute Public Health ( INSP ) . A previously validate questionnaire use evaluate adherence study recommendation diet exercise ( e.g. , walking , bike jog least 30 minutes/day , 5 day per week ) . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The result show baseline mean ± standard deviation ; comparison baseline 6 month absolute change percentage weight loss . We use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) mean X2 test percentage compare two group overtime . Two strategy use analyze data : 1 ) participant complete study six month , 2 ) participant drop study baseline six month , use last recorded measure-ment . The analysis percentage weight loss baseline 6 month adjust adherence study recommendation . For analysis , participant adhere minimum 75 % study design recommendation consider . Statistical calculation perform use STATA program version 13 . Ethical biosecurity This study approve ethic , research , biosafety committee INSP . Written inform consent obtain participant . All researcher participate ethic certification course , `` Human Participants Protection Education Research Teams '' , give US National Institutes Health ( NIH ) .</detailed_description>
