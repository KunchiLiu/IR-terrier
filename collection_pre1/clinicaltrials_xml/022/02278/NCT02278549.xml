	<brief_summary>Low back pain ( LBP ) complex common problem major societal repercussion . Clinical evaluation , especially functional assessment , necessary proper diagnosis decision appropriate treatment . The assessment lumbar kinematics frequently describe . For instance , measure range motion ( ROM ) , angular velocity acceleration total lumbar spine ( TLx ) demonstrate difference healthy subject LBP patient . However , recent evidence suggest model evaluate TLx insufficient . In fact , regional difference kinematics describe upper lumbar spine low lumbar spine . The aim study evaluate difference spinal kinematics healthy subject LBP patient use multi-segment model spine allow regional analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Spinal Kinematics Between Asymptomatic Subjects Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A case-controlled study perform compare asymptomatics subject patient low back pain . ROM , angular velocity coordination spine collect laboratory camera-based system ( VICON ) . Subjects perform normal ROM assessment three anatomical plane , well different functional activity sit stand , step walk . The measurement session occur one occasion participant .</detailed_description>
