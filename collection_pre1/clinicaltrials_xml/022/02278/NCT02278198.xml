	<brief_title>Evaluation Thyroid Stunning From Diagnostic Dose I-123</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan learn medical problem call thyroid stunning . Thyroid stun temporary decrease function thyroid cell small dos radioiodine , radioactive drug commonly use treat thyroid cancer . Thyroid stun important medical problem patient thyroid cancer spread beyond thyroid gland ( metastasis ) . In patient thyroid cancer metastasis , researcher believe good give maximum safe dose radioiodine order great chance destroy cancer . The maximum safe dose high dose radioiodine patient safely receive , dose unique person . This special personalize dose determine first dosimetry study . Dosimetry study plan study calculates safest dose patient receive . Currently , know whether small dose radioiodine use dosimetry study may stun cancer cell make thyroid cancer treatment less effective . There two important type radioiodine . I-123 form radioiodine use take picture thyroid gland . I-131 form radioiodine use treat thyroid cancer . It hop study produce important information may first step resolve thyroid stunning question . Investigators use I-123 , form iodine currently know cause thyroid stunning , thyroid cancer treatment I-131 . Investigators try prove I-123 cause thyroid stun make thyroid cancer treatment less effective . Patients ask research study differentiate thyroid cancer , evidence thyroid cancer spread part body . As result , patient thyroid cancer treatment radioiodine small amount need treat patient thyroid cancer spread part body . Thyroid stun medical problem patient like . However , participate study , information investigator gather patient treatment thyroid cancer may help patient thyroid cancer metastasis .</detailed_description>
