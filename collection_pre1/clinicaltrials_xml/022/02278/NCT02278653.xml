	<brief_title>Functional Outcome Organ Preservation After Neo-adjuvant Chemo Radiation Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer common form cancer . Standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer long course neoadjuvant radiation combine chemotherapy ( CRT ) follow resection . However , neoadjuvant CRT induces downsize downstaging , result complete response 15-20 % patient . In patient surgery may omit . In investigator previous study investigator obtain good result organ save treatment . Although mortality morbidity associate radical surgery avoid , irradiated rectum remain situ , possibly cause functional problem . The primary objective describe functional outcome patient choose organ save treatment . Functional outcome evaluate questionnaire ( quality life ) manometric measurement ( maximal resting pressure , maximal squeezing pressure , sphincter length , percentage asymmetry rest sphincter , sustain duration , length high pressure zone , rectoanal inhibitory reflex , rectal sensory threshold , rectal compliance ) . Secondary objective include : estimation cumulative risk local failure within 5 year , estimation cumulative risk disease-free , distant-metastasis-free overall survival within 5 year , determine percentage patient choose organ save treatment instead standard resection , determine compliance intensive follow-up , compare cost-effectiveness organ save treatment standard surgical resection period 5 year . These objective assess frequent revision electronic patient file , patient follow four time per year . Study design : prospective observational registration study 'invasive diagnostic procedure ' Study population : The population consist patient , age 18 year old , locally advanced rectal cancer chemoradiation clinical complete response ( ycT0N0 ) good response ( ycT1-2N0 ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study endpoint functional outcome score base questionnaire manometric measurement Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The questionnaire take approximately 20 minute complete . There relatively low rate side effect associate manometric measurement . Results study contribute well understanding functional complaint rectal cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
