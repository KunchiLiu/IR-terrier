	<brief_summary>By 2030 estimate 2 million people US need dialysis transplantation advance kidney failure . An even disturb statistic mortality End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) six time higher general Medicare population adjustment age , gender ethnicity . Protein energy waste highly prevalent patient one important determinant poor clinical outcome . Despite well-recognized occurrence , etiology mechanism lead protein energy waste observe chronic hemodialysis patient attribute single factor . However , irrespective specific etiologic mechanism , appear common pathway metabolic derangement relate exaggerated protein degradation relative protein synthesis ( 47 ) . Two well-recognized presumably interrelate metabolic abnormality , insulin resistance chronic inflammation , may major determinant protein catabolism coronary heart disease ( CHD ) patient . There study examine effect anti-inflammatory intervention and/or insulin sensitizer protein homeostasis CHD . Due establish anti-inflammatory pleiotropic effect , Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra insulin sensitizer peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) agonist Actos represent two promising intervention . By modulate inflammatory response insulin signal two pharmacological intervention , investigator unique opportunity clarify mechanism contribute two particular metabolic derangement development protein energy waste observe chronic hemodialysis patient . The overall goal elucidate mechanism chronic inflammation insulin resistance influence development protein energy waste hemodialysis patient . Specific Aim : To test hypothesis inhibit inflammatory response administration IL-1r antagonist ( Anakinra ) increase insulin sensitivity administration PPAR agonist ( Actos ) improve net protein metabolism . Hypothesis : The chronic inflammatory component protein energy wasting ( PEW ) observe hemodialysis patient , least part , mediate insulin resistance . Interim analysis may perform ( specific plan time ) .</brief_summary>
