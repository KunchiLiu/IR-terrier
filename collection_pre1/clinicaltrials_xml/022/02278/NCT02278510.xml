	<brief_summary>Topotecan FDA-approved drug give intravenous injection , effective brain tumor give intravenously . The Cleveland Multiport Catheter new , investigational device use deliver topotecan directly participant ' brain tumor . One purpose study determine whether Cleveland Multiport Catheter use effectively safely deliver topotecan directly brain tumor . This study also evaluate different dos topotecan deliver participant 's brain tumor use Cleveland Multiport Catheter , also examine tumor respond treatment topotecan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Using Convection-Enhanced Delivery ( CED ) High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look way topotecan inject participant 's tumor . A small amount contrast dye ( call gadolinium DTPA ) add topotecan inject . Pictures take tumor MRI machine . This allow investigator see tumor topotecan inject . Issues related patient selection , coordination therapeutic palliative clinical option , patient quality life impact study . Except infusion topotecan gadolinium DTPA tumor , MRI image infusion process , procedures treatment participant experience care brain tumor non-investigational ; type medical treatment , procedure , test experience Standard Care patient brain tumor . Primary Objectives : - To investigate MR image spatial temporal distribution topotecan tumor tumor-infiltrated brain administer convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) patient recurrent/progressive WHO grade III IV ( high grade ) glioma ( HGG ) fail standard therapy comprise surgical biopsy and/or resection adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy - To investigate MR image influence rate topotecan concentration , spatial temporal distribution topotecan administer CED patient recurrent/progressive HGG - To evaluate spatial temporal distribution topotecan , MR imaging , deliver enhance tumor tissue versus non-enhancing tumor tissue ( define pre-operative conventional MRI imaging without intravenous gadolinium ) Secondary Objectives : - To investigate extent backflow may observe MRI CED-mediated delivery topotecan - To assess safety , tolerability toxicity profile topotecan administer CED use different dos infusion rate - To observe evidence activity single-agent topotecan administer CED patient recurrent/progressive HGG fail standard therapy comprise surgical biopsy and/or resection adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy</detailed_description>
