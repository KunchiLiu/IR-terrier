	<brief_summary>In study , novel MRI technique study small bowel apply patient diverticular disease . The ratio visceral subcutaneous fat also determine use MRI measurement . These data correlate measurement adipokines determine visceral fat specific influence severity diverticular disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DD Obesity MRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonic diverticulosis common structural abnormality colon study suggest incidence and/or complication increase . Increasing evidence suggest link obesity complication diverticular disease . With prevalence obesity increase westernised population , risk complication diverticular disease likely also increase . At present however , little understanding diverticular complication increase obesity . A high BMI might surrogate marker lifestyle factor predispose diverticular complication . Visceral fat may also influence related complication , due compound secrete adipocytes . Altered bowel habit common complaint diverticular patient . The cause well understood , probably multi-factorial , may include change small bowel . Until recently , study large small bowel require intestinal intubation perfusion could perform undisturbed colon . New MRI technique develop , allow area study non-invasively . Abdominal fat also measure use MRI , distribution subcutaneous visceral fat compare symptomatic asymptomatic diverticular patient .</detailed_description>
