	<detailed_description>Calcific uremic arteriolopathy ( CUA ) , also know calciphylaxis , vascular calcification disorder associate 60-80 % one-year mortality significant morbidity . CUA predominantly affect end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient present painful skin lesion . Although rare ( prevalence : 4 % dialysis patient ) , incidence CUA rise show u others . Mural calcification dermal arteriole hallmark histological finding CUA . However , significant gap understand pathophysiology risk factor CUA effective therapy . In animal model , vitamin K prevents vascular calcification serve co-factor Matrix Gla Protein ( MGP ) carboxylation , process convert decarboxylated-MGP ( dc-MGP ) carboxylated-MGP ( c-MGP ) . By inhibit pro-calcification Bone Morphogenic Protein ( BMP ) ligands , c-MGP act potent vascular calcification inhibitor . uc-MGP inactive vascular calcification inhibitory property . However , effect vitamin K administration CUA remain unknown . Aim : To conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) oral vitamin K CUA . The investigator examine follow hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Vitamin K therapy , compare placebo , increase carboxylate Matrix Gla Protein chronic hemodialysis patient CUA . Hypothesis 2 : Vitamin K therapy safely administer chronic hemodialysis patient CUA . Hypothesis 3 : Vitamin K therapy lead improvement CUA pain average lesion size compare placebo chronic hemodialysis patient . Study population procedure : Twenty patient enrol pilot RCT 2-year study period . Study Procedures : Patients meet eligibility criterion consent randomized receive either vitamin K ( phylloquinone ) 10 mg orally three time week total 12 week identical appear placebo . Follow-up occur every 4 week information obtain regard pain severity , number size CUA lesion ( ) , adverse event . Blood sample take baseline 12-week follow-up . Sample process assay : Blood sample ( plasma serum , total 30 mL ) take baseline 12-week follow-up .</detailed_description>
