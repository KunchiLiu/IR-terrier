	<brief_title>Driving Performance Teenage Patients With mTBI : Longitudinal Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3A . Teen drive Motor vehicle crash ( MVCs ) lead cause death teen U.S.1 Young people age 15 24 year account approximately $ 26 billion total cost related motor vehicle injury year.2 In state Ohio 2013 , age group account 240 death cost exceed $ 200 million medical expense lose work time.3,4 Teen driver age 16 19 year account much morbidity mortality . Teens high risk MVC compare age group5—per mile driven , three time likely fatal MVC driver 20 year older.6 Driving automobile require complex set cognitive , perceptual motor skill must utilize concert successful safe driving performance . Specifically , involve simultaneous control lateral longitudinal position vehicle combination high amount visual attention roadway , necessary inform decision resultant drive action manage current future drive situations.7-9 Driving also require timely efficient response complex array stimulus ( e.g. , traffic sign signal ) , potential challenge ( e.g. , pedestrian automobile ) . Accordingly , latency driver 's perceptual-motor response ( i.e. , reaction time ) stimuli challenge may critically important avoidance MVCs . Unfortunately , teen driver know drive faster allow shorter headway old , experienced drivers10 . Even trouble teen driver likely use attention-distracting technology ( e.g. , cell phone ) driving11 , prone attentional lapse two passenger automobile experience adults.10 Thus , give inattentiveness , teen driver likely force rely heavily reaction time shorter cognitive perceptual-motor response avoid adverse driving event experience driver . 3B . Driving related deficit patient mTBI Closed head injury concussion become prevalent teenage population : Over recent 10-year period 200 % increase sport related emergency room visit concussion among teen 14 19 year age.12 Negative sequela associate concussion include reduce attention span , long reaction time , impaired cognitive function deficit oculomotor control13-17—all critically important factor safe , effective driving performance . Moreover , symptom tend linger even patient clear return normal activity , case may persist several month follow initial injury.18 Very little known severity duration perceptual-motor cognitive deficit relate acute concussion ( ≤ 1 week initial injury ) pediatric population , although conclusion draw research young adult mTBI population . For example , adult mTBI exhibit slow reaction time time initial injury 6-weeks post-injury compare healthy , matched controls13 . Moreover , adult patient exhibit long performance time simple reaction-based response memory task even physical symptom resolve patient cleared resume normal activities14 . In fact , particular study patient return baseline reaction time performance day clearance give return contact sport ( M = 4 day ) . Similarly , series study high school collegiate football player demonstrate group exhibit great cognitive impairment , indexed Standardized Assessment Concussion ( SAC ) test evaluation neurocognitive functioning , first several day initial injury.15,19 Specifically , age group exhibit pre-injury baseline performance orientation , concentration memory 48 hour initial injury ; however , cognitive processing find resolve 7 day post-injury collegiate athletes.15 Disruptions neurological network associate oculomotor control impair visual task performance patient mTBI well20 . For example , adult mTBI exhibit impaired eye movements17,20 manifest long , frequent self-paced saccade slower reflexive saccade . These impairment give rise lower visuospatial accuracy well decrease smooth pursuit track performance.17,20 Other work demonstrate variability saccade work memory task correlate white matter integrity brain patient mTBI , indicate oculomotor behavior may link degree diffuse axonal injury patients.21-23 Similar oculomotor deficit observe child ( 6-16 year age ) acquire brain injury.24 Those deficit show constrain ability process high frequency sensory information , make difficult child utilize anticipation strategy feedback . Taken combination , evolve oculomotor symptom profile may emblematic problem patient participate activity daily live , include driving , symptom arise ( e.g. , nausea , dizziness , fatigue ) due participation activity . 3C . The profile driving performance patient mTBI incomplete At present , data safe allow acutely concussed teenager drive . This critical gap literature . Acute concussion symptom potential greatly exacerbate already high-risk drive behavior exhibit healthy teenager . Further , absence return-to-drive criterion , physician force decide whether teen fit drive follow concussion limited information . This potential put teen high risk MVCs accompany cost . Recently , research begin examine relation neurocognitive deficit negative characteristic drive performance adult mTBI.25,26 Patients mTBI require watch video genuine traffic scene film driver 's point view respond mouse click potential traffic hazard early possible . The result indicate patient demonstrate slow response traffic hazard initial 24 hour injury compare match controls.26 More directly , actual driving performance adult mTBI 3 day post-injury assess drive simulator.27,28 In one study patient exhibit great deviation center drive lane absence deficit speed management.27 However , separate study research group find speed management variable , overall deviation center lane find differ patient controls.26 While conflict , result study indicate improvement measure drive performance positively correlate improvement cognitive performance reaction time ( assessed ImPACT test ) , well reduction clinical deficit three day post-injury ( session 1 ) compare patient clear return normal activity ( session 2 ) .27,28 Thus , change drive performance population believe correlated change cognition reaction time performance first several day injury . However , link measure drive performance clear . There several additional gap current literature concussion drive performance . First , reaction time deficit know manifest longer response latency identify adverse risk , underlie mechanism drive behavior well understood . In order understand long response time manifest context , necessary examine several testable component reaction time behavior : ( 1 ) adequate efficient visual attention roadway ( 2 ) oculomotor control drive visual search , ( 3 ) efficiency cognitive-perceptual process identify situation one `` adverse risk '' , ( 4 ) decision make dictate whether action ( ) take avoid risk , ( 5 ) motor output drive specific action ( ) risk avoidance . Therefore , identification response latency population merely first step understand underlie mechanisms lead potential change drive performance . Adequate efficient visual attention roadway one potential mechanism slow response time patient mTBI . Healthy experience adult driver utilize strategy call timesharing safely shift attention roadway . This strategy involve set saccadic eye movement toward away secondary task ( e.g. , change radio station ) complete ( Figure 1 ) ,29,30 successful timesharing limit duration glance away roadway less equal 2 s29,31 ( translate approximately 160 foot distance drive 55 mph ) . However , 45 % teen driver exhibit glance great equal 2.5 away roadway ( critical threshold MVC risk ) , compare 10 % experienced drivers.32 The investigation question therefore require analysis oculomotor performance , specifically self-paced reflexive saccade behavior . This patient mTBI may timeshare equally healthy peer , simply exhibit slow reaction time transition timeshare . Alternatively , lack control visual saccade may potentially lead great inefficiency timesharing patient , precious millisecond may spend correct inexact self-paced saccade . This behavior might take away time attend give task , may thus lead protracted glance away roadway . For similar reason , inefficient self-paced reflexive saccade may lead great delay ( slow reaction time ) recognition adverse event , decrease driver response time . Further , inefficiencies track move object ( smooth-pursuit track deficit ) may lead miscalculation purposeful steer deviation risk avoidance object identify , potentially , poor risk assessment altogether visual information ( e.g. , time contact ) may degrade . Such smooth-pursuit track deficit , combine slow cognitive processing time patient , may ultimately lead reduced performance capability may difficult patient overcome . Importantly , investigator knowledge research examine effect oculomotor control deficits drive performance individual mTBI . This surprising give oculomotor process likely underlie perceptual-motor cognitive behavior critical safe effective driving . Also , standardize assessment cognition simple reaction time sensitive specific measure concussion33,34 , evidence lack relation drive performance teenage patient mTBI . In addition , research examine profile drive performance teenage driver time-course recovery .</detailed_description>
