	<brief_summary>This study two-arms study intend demonstrate superiority NexoBrid treatment SOC child thermal burn . The study objective evaluate safety clinical benefit NexoBrid hospitalize child ( 0-17 year ) deep partial and/or full thickness thermal burn 1-30 % TBSA compare NexoBrid standard care ( SOC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety NexoBrid Children With Thermal Burns Compared Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 160 patient randomize NexoBrid SOC treatment ( 80 patient per arm ) . Age distribution manage follow : - 40 patient 0-23 month old - 40 patient 24 months-3 year old - 48 patient 4-11 year old - 32 patient 12-17 year old The study conduct two stage . In Stage I , 50 child age 4-17 year , hospitalize burn unit , deep partial thickness burn range 1 % -30 % TBSA , meet entrance criterion , enrol . Upon completion stage I ( 50th patient reach wound closure ) , interim analysis perform safety parameter result blindly evaluate Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . If DSMB safety concern , Stage II commence , time enrol child age 0-17 year accord study procedure . Following enrollment subject study prior randomization , physicians define one Target Wounds ( TWs ) per subject accord TWs definition . All subject ' DPT FT burn fit specified criterion intend receive study treatment per randomize study arm therefore , must designate TWs . Prior eschar removal treatment NexoBrid SOC subject medicate appropriate analgesia undergo wound cleanse dress wound antibacterial solution . Following wound cleanse antibacterial treatment , subject undergo eschar removal process per treatment assignment ( NexoBrid SOC , follow randomization ) . Subsequent eschar removal , wound assess treated manner , accordance post-eschar removal wound care strategy . Furthermore , subject undergo daily assessment ( Vital sign ( VS ) pain assessment ) one week weekly assessment thereafter , wound closure . Following wound closure , subject follow 6 week , 12 week , , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month ( blind assessment cosmesis , function QoL evaluation ) .</detailed_description>
