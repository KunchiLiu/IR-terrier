	<brief_summary>In treatment patient lymphoma common high-dose chemotherapy regimen use prior autologous transplantation ( ASCT ) BEAM regimen . It consist four chemotherapy drug together ( BCNU , etoposide , cyclophosphamide , melphalan ) , whose initial letter group together BEAM regimen . One common organ damage intensive treatment cause drug BCNU ; involve lung injury , manifest month ASCT increase shortness breath cough , result pulmonary fibrosis . The drug bendamustine use successfully different lymphoma type , efficacy lymphoma therapy well document . Moreover bendamustine n't cause lung injury . Initially experience bendamustine instead BCNU - so-called BeEAM scheme - show scheme quite effective well tolerate , without lung injury . In BeEAM scheme therefore bendamustine replace BCNU , three drug administer dosage order . The aim present study conduct four center ( Bern Zurich Switzerland , Vienna Salzburg Austria ) compare two high-dose chemotherapy schema show BeEAM scheme cause significantly less lung injury BEAM regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Two High-dose Chemotherapies BeEAM BEAM Given Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation ( ASCT ) Lymphoma Patients ( BEB-trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background High-dose chemotherapy ( HDCT ) follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) consider treatment choice relapsed/refractory lymphoma . On basis result PARMA study group trial , high-dose chemotherapy follow ASCT become standard care patient relapse , chemo-sensitive aggressive lymphoma treatment choice patient relapse follicular lymphoma Hodgkin 's disease . The BEAM ( BCNU , etoposide , cyclophosphamide , melphalan ) chemotherapy regimen frequently use condition regimen since thirty year . Toxic pneumonia interstitial infiltration impairment diffusion capacity lung recognize complication HDCT regimens contain BCNU . Recently , show EAM regimen ( thus omit BCNU ) sufficient obtain equal response rate compare BEAM poor disease control result impaired disease-free survival ( DFS ) . Thus , might detrimental patient eliminate BCNU without appropriate substitution . Replacing BCNU Bendamustine potential eradicate residual treatment-resistant lymphoma cell could promise clinical approach investigate randomized phase II clinical trial compare standard BEAM BeEAM . Bendamustine combine alkylating activity mustard group antimetabolite activity purine analogue study several entity B-cell neoplasm demonstrate significantly superior efficacy compare standard therapy treatment relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) indolent NHL myeloma . The BRIGHT study confirm non-inferiority immunochemo-therapy Rituximab-Bendamustine compare R-CHOP Rituximab , Cyclophosphamide , Vincristine , Prednisone ( R-CVP ) indolent lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma . Recently , Visani et al show Bendamustine , couple fixed dos Etoposide , Cytarabine , Melphalan ( ie , BeEAM ) condition regimen ASCT resistant/relapsed lymphoma ( HD NHL ) patient highly active result promising result concern safety efficacy . No treatment mortality observe relevant pulmonary toxicity see . Non-hematological toxicity moderate , prominent toxicity gastroenteritis grade 3 4 34 % mucositis grade 3 4 35 % , respectively . No grade 3 4 cardiac toxicity toxic pneumonia observe . Engraftment rapid trilinear , stable hematopoiesis observe . BeEAM effective , 81 % patient complete response median observation time 18 month . A recent update study show 41 month still 72 % patient still complete remission 3-year performance status ( PS ) 75 % . Four patient show first remission ever Bendamustine contain regimen . In 35 patient treat Vienna centre accord Visani BeEAM protocol , encourage data Visani et al could reproduce ; similar toxicity rapid stable engraftment observe . Finally , combination Bendamustine sequential application high-dose Cytarabine report improve response rate relapse lymphoma . In conclusion , seem promise integrate Bendamustine myelobablative regimen ASCT , randomize clinical trial lack far . Objective Replacing chemotherapeutic drug BCNU Bendamustine within four-drug chemotherapy regimen BEAM reduce occurrence early late pulmonary toxicity lymphoma patient undergo high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation . Primary Objective : This study intend show clinically meaningful reduction lung toxicity - defined decrease diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 15 % baseline ASCT - 25 % patient BEAM group 4 % patient BeEAM group 3 12 month ASCT . Lung toxicity . Secondary Objectives : Acute late toxicity/adverse event ( CTCAE 4.0 ) . Hematologic recovery engraftment 3 month . Early late lung toxicity Cardiac assessment ECHO/ECG quality life before,3 12 month ASCT . Overall survival progression free survival 12 month yearly routine follow-up assessment . Methods Two high-dose chemotherapy regimen ( BeEAM versus BEAM ) use condition treatment autologous stem cell transplantation compare 1:1 randomization . The experimental arm BeEAM regimen . The BEAM regimen control treatment . Lung toxicity assess spiroergometry 60 % level maximum exercise capacity , well assess diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) . This analysis perform ASCT , well 3 month 12 month ASCT . Patients assess cardio-pulmonary toxicity ASCT , well 3 12 month ASCT . Thereafter , patient follow-up perform clinically per year .</detailed_description>
