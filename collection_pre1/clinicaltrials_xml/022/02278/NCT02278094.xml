	<brief_summary>Background : OSAS type sleep disorder characterize intermittent , partial complete upper airway ( UA ) collapse , seriously impact sleep apnea respiratory insufficiency . The major upper airway dilator muscle ( genioglossus ) active period stable breathing compare period cyclical breathe obstructive apnea occur . UA muscle strength linearly related inspiratory pump muscle strength . The ratio UA muscle strength ( tongue protrusion , TP ) inspiratory pump muscle strength ( PImax ) different individual without OSAS . However , highly wakeful ratio TP force PImax appear associate reduced propensity moderate-to-severe OSAS . Up 95 % OSAS case treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , effective , commonly use , low-risk treatment method . However , patient use CPAP therapy could face ongoing difficulty . Aims : To evaluate effect home-based exercise patient moderate severe OSAS . This study randomize clinical trial conduct three different intervention protocol experimental group . We use cluster random sample assign group . CPAP treatment group control group . Methods : Subject 20 year old diagnose moderate severe OSAS . Subjects assign walking exercise ( WE ) , Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer ( TIMT ) Tongue Muscle Trainer ( TMT ) treatment group . We compare Polysomnography ( PSG ) data , Epworth Sleepiness scale ( ESS ) , World Health Organization Quality Life ( WHOQOL ) questionnaire short version original instrument ( WHOQOL-BREF ) , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWD ) , rate perceive exertion scale ( RPE ) , flow-volume loop ( FV-Loop ) , tongue grasp muscle strength , anthropometric data daily note baseline , 3 month ( end-of-intervention ) 6 month ( post intervention follow-up ) patient moderate severe OSAS . They undergo three month home-based exercise . Patients follow weekly telephone call interview monthly . Expected result : By use WE , TIMT TMT therapy , airway collapse sleep prevent whole body muscle strength , inspiratory pump muscle strength tongue muscle strength enhance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influences Intervention With Home-based Recovery Activity Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common form sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) characterize repetitive episode cessation breathe sleep due upper airway collapse . It cause sleep fragmentation , disable daytime sleepiness , impaired cognitive function poor quality life . In addition , OSAS associate non-fatal fatal cardiovascular consequence include sudden death well increase risk road traffic accident . OSAS common disease , affect approximately 2 % woman 4 % men reside Western community . Risk factor OSAS include obesity , age , particularly male , abnormal craniofacial morphology , nasal obstruction , genetic factor . OSAS associate several cardiovascular consequence social consequence motor vehicle accident , impaired cognitive performance , depression . Various epidemiologic study show association OSAS hypertension . In cross-sectional study , OSAS associate increased prevalence self-reported heart failures stroke . OSAS show independently associate coronary artery disease adjustment traditionally consider risk factor . According American Medical Association 2013 , obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common disorder affect everyone age , especially middle-aged elderly people . In fact , evidence show OSAS rate increase due escalation obesity rate . Thus , goal OSAS treatment alleviate airway obstruction sleep . The standard first-line OSAS treatment involve continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device , deliver compress air airway order stay open . In case , many patient tolerate CPAP often unable adhere instruction many reason . Patients begin feel discomfort claustrophobic well skin irritation noise . Although small study lack data OSAS treatment , case result insufficient evidence determine efficacy strategy . In regard limit data , evidence yet resolve effectiveness treatment . There limited evidence clinical outcome OSAS intervention , data focus immediate result exceedingly direct provide long-term benefit . Likewise , evidence evaluate relative efficacy weight loss , oronasopharyngeal exercise tongue retrain device intervention OSAS treatment insufficient . Low-quality evidence indicate intervention improve sleep measure recommend patient OSAS . Purpose : The aim study assess effect PSG data , Epworth Sleepiness scale ( ESS ) , WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWD ) , rate perceive exertion scale ( RPE ) , flow-volume loop ( FV-Loop ) , tongue grasp muscle strength , anthropometric data daily note record two group ( control group : CPAP therapy experimental group : subgroup WE , TIMT TMT therapy ) patient moderate severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize moderate severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patient home-based recovery activity intervention program improve PSG data , quality life , exercise ability , pulmonary function , muscle strength , anthropometric data daily note record patient receive CPAP alone .</detailed_description>
