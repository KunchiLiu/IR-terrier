	<brief_summary>The clinical manifestation pulmonary embolism vary greatly absence specific clinical symptom cardiogenic shock cardiac arrest . Clinical form EP represent `` lung superinfection '' , also call `` pulmonary embolism superinfect '' common represent 30 % initial clinical presentation ; evaluation clinical research . The reality bacterial infection remain controversial clinical presentation often lead prescription empirical antibiotic therapy , often unnecessary many case . Number antibiotic prescription probably inappropriate . Fever long recognize sign associate pulmonary embolism . Stein et al report temperature 37.5 ° C 50 % patient acute pulmonary embolism without actually clarify whether related temperature pulmonary embolism associate cause . Murray et al estimate great 38 ° C explain pulmonary embolism 57.1 % patient PIOPED study , 14 % patient fever cause identified pulmonary embolism . Fever due pulmonary embolism often low intensity ( often less 38.3 ) short duration , peak day pulmonary embolism gradual decrease 1 week . The pathophysiology fever pulmonary embolism yet completely clarify . It suggest combination several factor involve pyrogenic myocardial tissue necrosis release pro-inflammatory cytokine , hemorrhage , vascular irritation inflammation , atelectasis local superinfection . Since 2004 , PCT become marker help initiation antibiotic therapy patient community-acquired pneumonia . This especially verified patient admit acute exacerbation chronic obstructive bronchitis . In latter case , use PCT reduces inappropriate antibiotic prescribing . Thus help clinician measure biomarkers PCT base write algorithm lead use antibiotic . The use algorithm involve PCT could infectious pneumonia COPD , interest febrile pulmonary embolism distinguish febrile form relate bacterial infection febrile form EP cause .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Embolism PCT . PE-PCT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose realize single-center prospective , randomize , parallel group , compare two group patient admit febrile pulmonary embolism pulmonary infarction . In first group patient , use antibiotic guide clinical ( clinical group ) . In second group , use antibiotic guide algorithm ( PCT group ) . The guided PCT algorithm give aid clinician therapeutic management without application require doctor charge patient . So doctor may advocate ( deem necessary ) continue ( start ) antibiotic even PCT algorithm would allow stop ( initiate ) .</detailed_description>
