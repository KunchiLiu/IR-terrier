	<brief_title>Phase II Study Axitinib Advanced Solitary Fibrous Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigator initiate , open label , prospective , non-randomized , phase II trial aim evaluate activity Axitinib progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive advance Solitary Fibrous Tumor ( SFT ) patient . Patients document centrally review pathologic radiologic diagnosis progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive advance SFT may enter study . Axitinib administer dose 5mg twice day , continuously . Treatment continue till evidence progression , toxicity patient withdrawal . The activity Axitinib evaluate term overall response rate accord Choi Criteria define GIST patient treat Imatinib , extend even MRI . Secondary objective study : response rate RECIST , progression free survival , overall survival , clinical benefit ( RECIST Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease &gt; 6 month ) . Whenever possible post-treatment biopsy perform assess Axitinib target status treatment correlate status response . Tumor assessment CT scan and/or MRI perform within 4 week prior first dose Axitinib 4 week start treatment , every 2 month progression toxicity . As per protocol experimental treatment administer front line . The study consider positive 30 % response rate Choi criterion observe . To end maximum 16 evaluable patient enrol two year . In case positive study trial re-open confirm result large number patient .</detailed_description>
