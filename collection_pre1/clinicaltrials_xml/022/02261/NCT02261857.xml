	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient-specific computer-aided design ( CAD ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing utilized produce personalize , effective continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) mask child severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) craniofacial anomaly encounter significant difficulty use CPAP poorly fit mask despite exhaust available commercial mask option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D-Printed CPAP Masks Children With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common problem general pediatric population , generally cite 1-5 % , morbidity range daytime behavioral problem inattention cardiopulmonary effect include hypertension ventricular hypertrophy . OSA dramatically prevalent among child certain craniofacial anomaly syndrome ( e.g . Pierre-Robin , Treacher Collins , etc . ) , generally small , short jaw , midface hypoplasia , and/or disproportionally large tongue . While tonsillectomy adenoidectomy consider first line therapy OSA general pediatric population , child OSA due craniofacial anomaly frequently require aggressive intervention improve breathe night , often include continuous positive airway pressure ventilation ( CPAP ) . Most child require CPAP therapy able find mask adequately seal provide acceptable comfort , however small percentage child encounter significant difficulty find functional CPAP interface , often dysmorphic facial feature . This prove significant barrier effective CPAP therapy lead frustration part patient ' caregiver provider , well associate morbidity untreated severe OSA . The purpose feasibility study investigate use patient-specific computational design three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing produce personalize CPAP mask child intolerant standard CPAP mask due poor fit secondary craniofacial anomaly encounter significant difficulty use CPAP poorly fit mask despite exhaust available commercial mask option . Study Design This prospective case study examine feasibility use patient-specific CAD 3D print technology produce personalize CPAP mask child intolerant commercially available mask due poor fit . Patients recruit pediatric otolaryngology , pediatric oral maxillofacial surgery , pediatric sleep clinic University Michigan Medical Center , target cohort five . Only patient study team member include study , recruitment take place outside clinic participate study team member . We anticipate study period last 3 year , though may terminate sooner recruitment target reach expeditiously . After recruitment consent potential study subject , subject undergo initial mask-design evaluation member research team . At initial visit , follow perform : 1 . A head &amp; neck physical exam , focus characteristic important treatment OSA ( e.g . jaw size position , tongue size position , characteristic palate , presence absence cleft , external nasal deformity , external internal nasal valvular collapse ) 2. Review patient 's photograph 3 . Generation topographic model patient 's facial anatomy utilize 3dMDface system ( specific ) export Stereolithography ( .STL ) file . The patient 's facial .STL file import computer-aided design ( CAD ) model program ( MimicsTM MagicsTM , Materialise , Belgium ) . Contact point along topographic model drawn utilized modeling custom mask . The custom mask model export .STL format import 3D printer fabrication use fused-deposition modeling ( FDM ) method ( Object Pro , Stratasys , Israel ) . Once mask fabricate , patient undergo mask-fit evaluation . If mask appear fit well , patient use home home CPAP one month consistent use . They return debrief re-evaluation , subsequent iteration mask design need . If mask function patient good alternative , patient allow continue use mask one year , ongoing surveillance research team , assess mask durability ongoing usage/compliance . Data collection include : - Objective data regard nature patient 's obstructive sleep apnea CPAP pressure requirement sleep-disordered breathing recent available polysomnograms ( sleep study , abbreviate PSG ) - Information regard prior CPAP mask attempt - One month compliance data downloads CPAP machine - prior `` best alternative '' usable , customized mask , include percentage day use , average hour usage , residual apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) time spend large leak per night . - Standardized interview patient parent regard mask use experience customize mask ( ) . - Descriptive anatomic information regard facial anomaly contribute poor mask fit , obtain physical exam , photograph , image study . - Validated quality life measure take completion trial period customize CPAP mask , include Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ ) OSA-18 , assess impact successful CPAP use patient . Analysis involve basic descriptive statistic describe objective outcome ( e.g . compliance data CPAP machine ) quality life measure ( PSQ OSA-18 survey ) well information individual experience collect interview . Additional Data 3D Photography System Patient facial model information obtain utilize 3dMDface system ( 3dMD , Atlanta , GA ) . The 3dMD system three-dimensional photography system generate three-dimensional model patient 's face utilizing multiple convergent camera ( see Figure 1 ) . The three-dimensional model generate utilizing hybrid stereophotogrammetry , software algorithm use project random pattern texture skin ( pore , freckle , etc . ) stereo-triangulate generate 3D surface image . The 3D model patient 's face create within 3dMDvultus software system , export model .STL format . No patient identify information store within .STL file . All 3D photography session study subject perform supervised one member study team . There cost associate use 3dMDface system . Utilizing 3D photography allow u obtain time-accurate topographic information patient 's face avoid cost risk associate conventional CT MRI image . Data Included Registry : - Pre- post- intervention OSA-18 PSQ questionnaire aggregate . Data record include : sum score mean score questionnaire . - Pre-intervention AHI oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) nadir base recent sleep PSG . - Pre-intervention CPAP requirement base recent CPAP titration PSG . - Pre-intervention compliance data downloads subject 's CPAP machine prior 1 month 's use . Data record include : percentage day use , average hour usage , residual apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , size leak liter per minute , time spend large leak per night . - Post-intervention compliance data downloads subject 's CPAP machine prior 1 month 's use . Data record include : percentage day use , average hour usage , residual apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , size leak liter per minute , time spend large leak per night . Data Registry QA : â€¢ Physical electronic PDF version data registry primary source ( questionnaire , polysomnograms , CPAP compliance report ) keep 5 year past duration study . Data upload patient registry verify institutional IRB .</detailed_description>
