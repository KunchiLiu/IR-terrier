	<brief_title>Preemptive Treatment With XONRID Reduce Radiation Induced Dermatitis Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient treat XONRID + standard care ( SOC ) preemptive treatment adopt radiation treatment head neck cancer patient Institution . Patients plan receive Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Techniques ( IMRT volumetric modulate radiotherapy , VMAT ) conventional fractionation total dose 50-66 GY postoperative set 66-70 Gy radical setting . Radiotherapy plan simultaneous boost ( SIB ) approach , use conventional fractionation ( 1.8-2.12 Gy/die ) . According histology , stage pathology report , patient could receive concomitant platinum base chemotherapy . The patient evaluate baseline , weekly interval RT six month treatment completion 2 different treat physician visit . The evaluation consist physician-assessed toxicity assessment use Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) , patient-reported outcome measure use Skindex-16 questionnaire . In addition objective vivo measurement skin erythema pigmentation base reflectance spectrometry ( RS ) perform . Measurements perform RT , every 5 RT fraction ( week ) end RT 6 month RT completion ( time clinical evaluation ) . Instrumental RS measurement perform five different fix region within area treat RT , case flat skin region neck area correspond second node level absence hair nevus .</detailed_description>
