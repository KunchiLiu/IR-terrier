	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus common cause chronic liver disease worldwide represent public health problem . The Egyptian Demographic Health Survey ( EDHS ) , cross sectional survey include hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) biomarkers , conduct 2008 large nationally representative sample . It estimate HCV prevalence among 15-59 year age group 14.7 % . Accordingly , Egypt high HCV prevalence world . Although HCV hepatotropic virus , patient primary manifestation infection occur outside liver . There grow body evidence support idea HCV replicate efficiently extrahepatic tissue include Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Autoimmune manifestation common patient chronically infected HCV . These manifestation dominant , whereas hepatic disease quiescent mild . More recently , grow interest relationship HCV Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . Of , article interested cutaneous mucous membrane manifestation many report show cutaneous manifestation often first sign chronic HCV infection indicate 20-40 % patient present dermatology clinic , therefore dermatologist must aware skin disorder associate viral infection . The commonly encountered dermatological manifestation HCV infection include mixed cryoglobulinemia ( MC ) , porphyria cutanea tarda ( PCT ) , cutaneous and/or oral lichen planus ( LP ) , urticaria , pruritus , thrombocytopenic purpura cutaneous vasculitis . Although majority skin manifestation chronic HCV infection represent clinical impression autoimmune phenomenon , however , precise pathogenesis extra-hepatic complication well understood . The aim study assess efficacy Ribavirin management mucocutaneous extrahepatic manifestation HCV infection This study conduct 30 patient mucocutaneous complaint document HCV infection . The study do Tropical medicine department , Tanta university . It conduct June2014 November 2014 .</detailed_description>
