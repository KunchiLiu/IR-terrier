	<brief_summary>This multicentre Vanguard randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate impact tranexamic acid ( TXA ) perioperative blood transfusion patient undergo liver resection . The rationale study include : ( 1 ) experimental evidence support use TXA surgical population ; ( 2 ) lack evidence patient undergo liver resection ; ( 3 ) clinical uncertainty extensive support amongst hepatobiliary surgeon , anaesthesiologists , hematologist propose trial ; ( 4 ) feasible efficient study design ; ( 5 ) importance question : incidence blood transfusion patient undergo liver resection high , consequence serious . Different region Canada well represent selection study sit five major site commit participate Vanguard trial : Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre ( Toronto ) , University Health Network ( Toronto ) , Foothills Medical Centre ( Calgary ) , McGill University Health Centre ( Montreal ) , Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre ( Halifax ) . We enroll 200 patient Vanguard study . This Vanguard study assist u determine feasibility plan definitive multicentre RCT across Canada . If Vanguard study confirm feasibility , expand trial additional site proceed directly definitive trial ( plan sample size = 1230 patient ) . The following brief schema study outline trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Results study provide essential feasibility data plan conduct large national trial definitively establish impact TXA blood transfusion patient undergo liver resection . There special challenge relate patient recruitment , adherence detailed transfusion protocol , data collection , TXA Vanguard trial help address . Success TXA Vanguard trial base ability achieve seven feasibility objective : ( 1 ) Proportion patient screen meet eligibility criterion definitive trial ; ( 2 ) Proportion eligible patient consent participate trial ; ( 3 ) Adherence randomize intervention ; ( 4 ) Missing data include operative detail , blood loss , blood transfusion , complication ; ( 5 ) Assess adherence perioperative blood transfusion guideline ; ( 6 ) Assess transfusion incidence ; ( 7 ) Estimate resource requirement participate site conduct full RCT . Hypothesis Results study provide essential feasibility data plan conduct large national trial definitively establish impact TXA blood transfusion patient undergo liver resection . Justification Were investigator demonstrate TXA use liver resection result important decrease blood transfusion , clinical practice worldwide would likely change . Over 2000 patient Canada undergo liver resection annually could benefit simple , low-cost intervention . This intervention could easily implement country , many patient undergo liver resection annually . Furthermore , TXA may beneficial operative field bleed major problem , include thoracic surgery , colorectal surgery , many others . There practical challenge relate patient recruitment , adherence detailed transfusion protocol data collection , TXA pilot Vanguard address . Objectives Before embark national definitive RCT address objective list Purpose , Vanguard trial seven specific feasibility objective : 1 . To determine proportion patient screen five major hepatopancreaticobiliary centre meet eligibility criterion definitive trial . 2 . To calculate proportion eligible patient consent participate trial . 3 . To assess ability randomize patient adherence group allocation . 4 . To examine ability collect complete perioperative data participant , include operative detail , blood loss , blood transfusion , complication . 5 . To assess adherence perioperative blood transfusion guideline . 6 . Assess transfusion incidence . 6 . To estimate resource requirement participate site conduct full RCT . The Primary Outcome length time require enroll 200 patient Vanguard trial . Research Method This multicentre Vanguard randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate impact tranexamic acid ( TXA ) perioperative blood transfusion patient undergo liver resection . The trial conceal allocation , maximize possible blinding , independently assess appropriateness transfusion , use strategy limit loss follow-up crossover , use conservative stopping rule . Patients administer single dose study drug intravenously immediately induction anaesthesia , follow infusion eight hour . Statistical Analysis The result Vanguard trial use assess feasibility inform design issue full RCT . We present point estimate feasibility event , include adherence protocol accrual , proportion 95 % CI . We present continuous data mean standard deviation , median inter-quartile range , appropriate .</detailed_description>
