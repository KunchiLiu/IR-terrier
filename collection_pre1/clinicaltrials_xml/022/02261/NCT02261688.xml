	<brief_title>Salt TH-17 Healthy Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , dietary sodium intake dramatically increase show play active role number detrimental disease include hypertension cardiovascular complication . Additionally , develop world , steady increase autoimmune disease . Type 17 helper T cell ( Th17 ) show play active role development autoimmune disease . Serum glucocorticoid kinase ( SGK1 ) show influence sodium transport salt homeostasis many cell type ( Wulf , J. Clin . Invest . 2002 ; Salker , Nature Med 2011 ) . Prior vitro vivo study show increase salt concentration medium dietary salt intake mice induces SGK1 expression enhances TH17 cell differentiation worsen experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , animal model multiple sclerosis ( Kleinewietfeld , Nature 2013 ; Wu , Nature 2013 ) . The finding study substantially increase investigator understanding environmental factor modulate development autoimmunity human . In animal model worsen effect high salt diet EAE dramatic . To investigator knowledge , propose study first determine salt intake adverse impact human . If document , one could envision development novel treatment approach human autoimmunity via regulation salt intake . Thus , overall goal study evaluate association sodium TH17 cell human subject . In addition measure TH17 cell flow cytometry investigator also measure interleukins IL-17a , IL-17f , IL-23 important TH17 differentiation production .</detailed_description>
