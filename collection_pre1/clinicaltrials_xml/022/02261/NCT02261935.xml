	<detailed_description>Caregiving place considerable burden family caregiver ( FCG ) . While burden study FCG outcome , also predictor outcome , include FCG quality life ( QoL ) . We adapt model caregiver burden hypothesize various mechanism address support need may contribute FCG QoL . In model , support need closely associate FCGs ' perceive social support preparedness caregiving . These variable operate ( partial ) mediator relationships primary stressor , include patient functional dependence symptom distress , secondary appraisal , perceive burden associate caregiving , , turn influence FCGs QoL . The model posit FCGs ' primary appraisal patient caregiving need ( e.g. , amount care provide ) influence functional dependence symptom distress patient , turn influence perceive support , preparedness caregiving , FCG burden , , ultimately , FCG QoL . These variable associate variety demographic health-related characteristic caregiver patient . Within context conceptual framework outline , CSNAT intervention view mediator relationship primary stressor appraisal FCG QoL ( primary outcome ) . Also , CSNAT intervention would lead enhanced social support , preparedness , reduce caregiver burden . A clustered randomize control trial ( RCT ) design use ascertain effectiveness CSNAT intervention improve QoL FCGs patient receive palliative care home . Participating home care nurse randomize one two comparator group ( usual care intervention ) FCGs patient assign correspond comparator group . Data additionally collect time frame manner non-randomized comparison usual care comparator group separate home care site nurse deliver intervention , help interpret result ( e.g. , determine extent contamination may occur ) . Update - August 31 , 2015 - Due low recruitment non-randomized , comparison , usual care , comparator group discontinue . Update - December 22 , 2016 - Due home care workloads participant nurse home care visit schedule participate home care office , delivery intervention do dedicate study nurse ( office ) . In office , family caregiver continue assign base randomize group assignment home care nurse . The dedicated study nurse meet separately FCGs intervention group deliver CSNAT intervention . Information arise CSNAT family caregiver ' support need communicate study nurse home care nurse home care nurse incorporate home care plan patient patient 's family . In home care office part change procedure , home care nurse intervention group continue deliver CSNAT intervention home care visit . Our specific hypothesis follow : - Hypothesis 1 : The use CSNAT practice support tool intervention lead improve FCG QoL time prior patient ' death bereavement . - Hypothesis 2 : The use CSNAT practice support tool intervention contribute follow secondary outcome FCGs time prior patient 's death : enhance perceive social support , improve preparedness provide care reduce caregiving burden . - Hypothesis 3 : CSNAT use home care patient death reduce grief symptom bereavement , among FCGs . In addition RCT , qualitative quantitative research conduct understand process relate implement CSNAT intervention palliative home care explain treatment result . We specifically address follow question : - How CSNAT support need document meet home care nurse ? - How home care nurse experience use CSNAT daily practice ? - How comfortable FCGs speaking home care nurse personal need ? - To extent relationship hypothesize conceptual framework support ? - What relative importance different CSNAT support need respect FCG QoL health illness trajectory , presence post-bereavement grief symptom ?</detailed_description>
