	<brief_summary>Spasticity common consequence injury central nervous system major problem motor function everyday activity . A method treat spasticity applies low-amplitude electrical stimulation garment built-in electrode , Mollii® ( Elektrodress ) , develop . The garment use combination individualized training stimulation mainly give antagonist spastic muscle . The general objective study evaluate efficacy cost associate Mollii® treatment spasticity due stroke cerebral palsy . Primary objective ; - study whether treatment Mollii® improve function activity - evaluate cost-effectiveness treatment , health-care perspective societal perspective . Secondary objective ; - study whether difference treatment effect stroke Cerebral Palsy group subgroup-analysis - ass compliance treatment - report adverse effect .</brief_summary>
