	<brief_summary>The loss muscle mass strength due age lead serious health problem older adult . Muscle health improve exercise training , people improve strength substantially , whereas others improve little . The reason variation unknown . This study investigate whether function immune system influence well people respond exercise . Older Veterans participate muscle size , strength , function measure periodically almost year . Participants drink nutritional supplement placebo daily complete 36 session strength training program . Participants vaccinate tetanus donate small amount blood muscle tissue study immune function compare muscle outcome train long-term follow-up . The study result increase investigator ' understand negative effect age muscle possibly lead good strategy muscle maintenance rehabilitation old adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Function Muscle Adaptations Resistance Exercise Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The study examine influence immune function old adult improvement muscle mass , strength , function resistance training . The maintenance benefit long term follow-up also examine . This objective accomplish double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial nutritional supplement ( Muscle Armor ) evidence suggest improve immune function , promote muscle growth , counteract muscle loss . The study premise age result decreased ability immune system respond stimuli exercise . The study propose supplement improve muscle health promote shift immune function old adult pro-inflammatory state towards state support muscle growth maintenance . Research Plan : The study randomize Veterans ( age 60-80 , N=50 ) participate supplement placebo group three phase study . The phase participation correspond three specific aim . Aim 1 determine 2-weeks supplementation improve immune function . Humoral immune function assess response vaccination . Innate immune function measure systemic cellular response acute resistance exercise investigator ' previous study indicate affected aging . Aim 2 determine supplementation 36 session progressive high-intensity resistance training boost improvement muscle size ( CT scan ) , strength , function ( gait balance ) . Muscle adaptation cellular level also measure . Aim 3 determine continue supplementation 26-weeks completion exercise training promote retention gain muscle size , strength , function . Multivariable test use compare result Aims 1 , 2 , 3 determine whether immune function correlate muscle adaptation training detrain . Methods : Participants undergo nine blood draw five muscle biopsy vastus lateralis course study effect supplement immune function cellular adaptation training measure . Three blood draw use ass antibody response tetanus , pertussis , diphtheria vaccine . Muscle blood collect bout exercise conduct 2-weeks supplementation prior training . Immune function measure use blood base pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine level , balance specific T-cell subpopulation , proliferative capacity mononuclear cell . Immune function measure muscle base macrophage content specific cytokine growth factor . The investigator ' previous study show muscle measure strongly correlate size strength gain training . Key signal pathway include nuclear factor-k B PI3 kinase also measure . The fifth biopsy collect post-training measure adaptation cellular level base change number satellite cell myonuclei fiber size . Hypotheses related measure test 80 % power detect least 0.8 standard deviation difference mean supplement placebo group . Clinical Relevance : Exercise clearly able affect immune function . However , propose study attempt modulate immune function determine effect exercise outcomes . The study also examine detrain , important issue old adult , usually omit training study . Thus , study potentially advance understanding mechanism muscle gain loss older adult , importantly , study evaluate nutritional intervention complement exercise support muscle health age . Targeting immune system may advantage needed old Veteran successfully maintain restore muscle mass , strength , function necessary personal independence .</detailed_description>
