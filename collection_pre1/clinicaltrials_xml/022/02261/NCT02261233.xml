	<brief_summary>The overall goal project develop sensitive objective clinical research tool assessment postural control trunk . In order accomplish goal , aim quantify balance performance unstable seat task . Specifically , investigator quantify balance performance low back pain participant osteopathic manipulative treatment . The investigator hypothesize significant improvement balance performance single session osteopathic manipulative treatment well 4 session osteopathic manipulative treatment improvement great learn effect . A secondary objective study quantify difference patient-oriented outcome measure ( e.g. , self-reported pain , disability ) low back pain participant osteopathic manipulative treatment . The investigator hypothesize significant improvement self-reported outcome follow osteopathic manipulative treatment . The association improvement postural control parameter patient-oriented measure also explore .</brief_summary>

Musculoskeletal pain primarily low back region Pain rating equal great 3 of10 indicate Numeric Rating Scale Pain Disability equal great 26 % indicated Oswestry Disability Questionnaire All candidate meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . Exclusion criterion selfreported . However , treatment session , physicians watch clinical sign symptom consistent physical finding suggestive presence exclusion criterion . In case , treatment discontinue subject exclude . Below list exclusion criterion : Inability unwillingness individual give write informed consent .
