	<brief_summary>NephroCheck measure concentration certain protein combination urine patient . In elevated value probability renal failure ( already proven intensive care patient ) . The investigator would like investigate whether investigator predict renal failure patient receive contrast enhance CT 's emergency department . That would lead early nephrologist consult patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use contrast agent - especially already impaired renal function - lead decline real function . The contrast enhance CT especially emergency patient important diagnostic tool example detection pulmonary embolism mesenteric ischemia . Creatinine use marker real function far . But investigator know creatinine perfect marker especially influenced age , sex , weight muscle mass . Especially diagnosis acute renal failure creatinine allow recent change kidney function . This prospective , unicentric study therefore investigate two new marker emergency patient need emergency contrast enhance CT early predict pending kidney function decline .</detailed_description>
