	<brief_title>Challenging Inflammatory Response System Insomnia Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep critical regulation maintenance biological system , sleep deficiency , insomnia , show associate elevated risk cardiovascular , metabolic , mood disorder . Despite high prevalence insomnia population , investigator understand biological consequence disorder respect inflammatory , autonomic , stress system marker limit , often consistent . In addition , insomnia may alter basal activity system , may change reactivity stressor challenge . In support assumption finding show poor sleep quality healthy individual associate strong biological response stressful challenge , cold pressor test . This test involve immersion hand ice-cold water . It one commonly use laboratory physiological challenge test , provoke unpleasantness , also increase stress inflammatory marker . Investigations system 's reactivity challenge may elucidate system abnormalities investigator capture assess basal system 's level . For example , patient rheumatoid arthritis , basal inflammatory level normal , response physiological stress challenge ( cold pressor test ) amplify . To investigator knowledge , study measure insomnia may affect reactivity biological system stressful challenge , may serve important indicator system 's dysregulation associate disease risk . In light , primary goal proposal investigate whether stress-related system reactive physiological stressful challenge insomnia disorder compare healthy control .</detailed_description>
