	<brief_summary>Parvovirus B19 small virus cause `` fifth '' disease , common infection childhood . In people sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , parvovirus B19 infection cause bone marrow stop produce red blood cell temporarily , life-threatening . A novel vaccine currently development child SCD . This study first step within large parvovirus B19 multi-institutional project help develop new vaccine , define value utility use novel assay measurement parvovirus-specific antibody . The main objective investigate relationship newly develop VP1u ELISA assay gold standard neutralization assay parvovirus B19 infection . The accurate test , call neutralize antibody assay , see person currently infection complex expensive would difficult use large research study test new vaccine . A new simpler test develop . The main goal study , iSCREEN , find new test work . There distinct lab perform VP1u ELISA neutralization assay respective laboratory access 's result individual subject . The VP1u ELISA perform St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital . Neutralization assay conduct National Heart , Lung Blood Institute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants sickle cell disease ( SCD ) divide three study group depend history parvovirus B19 infection . Each blood drawn and/or nasopharyngeal wash provide biological material evaluation assay . - Group A participant documented prior history parvovirus B19 infection ( aplastic crisis ) . - Group B participant document history parvovirus B19 infection ( aplastic crisis ) serve negative control investigation relationship VP1u ELISA gold standard neutralization assay parvovirus B19 infection . - Group C participant suspect and/or confirm acute parvovirus B19 infection ( febrile illness anemia without adequate compensatory reticulocytosis ) . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES - To estimate correlation VP1u enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) gold standard neutralization assay parvovirus B19 infection subject SCD document infection parvovirus B19 cause aplastic crisis . - To identify cut-off negativity VP1u ELISA neutralization assay subject SCD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - To characterize performance characteristic VP1u ELISA , include sensitivity specificity . - To describe kinetics antibody response generate follow acute parvovirus B19 infection serum nasal mucosa patient SCD .</detailed_description>
