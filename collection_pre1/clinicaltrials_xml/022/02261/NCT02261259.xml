	<brief_summary>The overall goal project develop sensitive objective clinical research tool assessment head-neck motor control . In order accomplish goal , investigator aim quantify change head-neck motor control osteopathic manipulative treatment . The investigator hypothesize head-neck motor control improve neck pain participant 4-weeks treatment . Additionally , investigator compare position force head-neck motor control healthy control neck pain patient . The investigator hypothesize baseline test position force head-neck motor control well healthy individual neck pain patient .</brief_summary>
