	<brief_summary>The investigator undertake first European Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) epilepsy surgery child FCD type II , prospectively evaluate role KD prior surgery improve seizure outcome . The investigator evaluate role KD disease-modifying treatment achieve seizure control improve neurodevelopment quality life . Children age 5 - 15 year pharmacoresistant epilepsy believe result focal cortical dysplasia type II , consider surgically treatable , randomise either receive 6m treatment presurgery ketogenic diet , proceed direct surgery ( pretreatment ) . Primary outcome time achieve period 6 month seizure freedom date randomisation . Tissue resect surgery also evaluate regard degree methylation DNA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epilepsy surgery accept effective management individual drug resistant focal onset epilepsy carefully select candidate . This aside , two RCTs perform adults temporal lobe epilepsy [ 1,2 ] , none child . Malformations cortical development common pathology responsible drug resistant focal epilepsy childhood [ 3 } . In retrospective study , successful surgical resection result seizure freedom malformation cortical development report 42-87 % case [ 4 ] , dependent series review completeness resection . Outcome related extent completeness resection , extent tissue remove remains challenge , especially young patient , limit lesion may unclear eloquent cortex may involve . FCD one specific type malformation , localise area abnormal cortex may subdivide I , II III dependent pattern determine cell type involve . This definition histological diagnosis recently classify International League Against Epilepsy [ 5 ] . Specifically FCD type II usually suggest characteristic change MRI scan . These change include increased cortical thickness , blur cortical-white matter junction , increase signal T2-weighted image , radially orient linear conical transmantle strip T2 hyperintensity , cortical thin localized brain atrophy . FCD type II may subdivide histopathologically IIa IIb difficult distinguish two radiologically . The KD high fat diet proven efficacy treatment drug resistant epilepsy child [ 6 ] . An RCT perform child age 2-16 year diagnose drug resistant epilepsy utilise either classical medium chain triglyceride KD , demonstrate &gt; 50 % reduction seizures 38 % participant 3 month compare 6 % change standard treatment , difference see two diet [ 7,8 ] . A RCT utilising relax approach KD , modify Atkins diet , demonstrate similar result [ 9 ] . One open label study suggest particular efficacy child epilepsy due FCD [ 10 ] . Clinical trial epigenetic pharmacological treatment promise already approve cancer [ 11 ] . Intriguingly , commonly use AED valproic acid ( VPA ) , histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor activity discover 2001 [ 12 ] . The HDAC antagonize effect VPA , however , considerably low compare second generation HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA , Zolinza , Vorinostat ) , LBH598 Romidepsin [ 11 ] . Unfortunately , HDAC inhibitor bear risk severe side effect systemically administer pregnancy . Nevertheless , also evidence epigenetic machinery modify nutrition dietary concept [ 13 ] ; dietary concept KD . Stimulus-induced DNA methylation change identify postnatal brain [ 14 ] , thus anticipate DNA methylation modification contribute molecular memory postmitotic neuron also epileptogenic network . We propose therapy KD directly indirectly target epigenetic machinery could helpful prevent , delay retard drug-resistant epilepsy . Recent experimental data animal model show classical KD attenuate epigenetic chromatin modification ( i.e . DNA methylation ) , master regulator gene expression functional adaptation cell , thereby modify disease progression [ 15 ] . This hypothesis suggest epigenetic mechanism play pivotal role epileptogenesis seizures induce epigenetic chromatin modification , aggravate epileptogenic condition [ 15 ] . We conduct first RCT epilepsy surgery child FCD type II , prospectively evaluate role KD prior surgery . 120 child age 5 - 15 year diagnosis Focal Cortical Dysplasia ( FCD ) type II b ( consistent MRI change ) , treatment failure least two anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) control continue seizure , seizure semiology consistent focal onset agree surgically treatable FCD resection continue seizure le 5 year , include trial parental/ legal representative consent . Children exclude history less two seizure 6 month prior randomisation previously use Ketogenic diet ( KD ) administration KD medically contraindicate . Patients recruit 19 participate European site 8 country undertake ketogenic diet epilepsy surgery child . Participants followed-up minimum 24 months/maximum 48 month ( depend time randomisation ) randomisation . Primary outcome time 6 month remission ( i.e . time achieve period 6 month seizure freedom date randomisation ) . Tissue remove surgery assess DNA methylation .</detailed_description>
