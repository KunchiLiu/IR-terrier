	<brief_title>The Effects ADHD Medication ( TEAM ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stimulant methylphenidate ( MPH ) commonly prescribe psychoactive medication child . An abundance study attest efficacy MPH attenuate inattentive , hyperactive , impulsive symptom child ADHD . Despite efficacy , child ADHD prescribe MPH poor continuity treatment variety reason , include forget administer medication delay obtain refill . In addition , accept clinical practice physician omit MPH period time , summer weekend ( i.e. , drug holiday ) . Since MPH discontinuation consider benign , many clinician employ special procedure inform family special precaution regard cessation . However , increase evidence suggest pharmacological effect MPH cause lasting change brain neurochemistry persist beyond medication discontinuation . Moreover , neurobiological effect discontinuation appear neurobehavioral consequence . There critical need well understand breadth magnitude neurobehavioral effect cause MPH discontinuation well well understand temporal trajectory deleterious effect . Hence , primary goal propose research conduct first randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial specifically design study negative effect MPH discontinuation multiple time point . 180 child diagnose ADHD participate across two recruitment site . After undergo 4-week MPH titration trial 4-week MPH maintenance phase , participant randomize either discontinue MPH ( receive placebo ) OR remain MPH 4 week . Comprehensive multi-time point , multi-informant ( parent , teacher , study staff ) multi-modal ( behavior/mood/affect rating scale , direct behavior observation , standardize test ) assessment use assess broad range neurobehavioral outcome . We examine magnitude time course effect MPH discontinuation behavioral well cognitive academic functioning child ADHD . Furthermore , examine moderator adverse effect MPH discontinuation outcome aid identification increase risk .</detailed_description>
