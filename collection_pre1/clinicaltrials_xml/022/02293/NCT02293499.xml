	<brief_summary>Asthma serious chronic health condition particularly inner-city adolescent , suffer disproportionately high asthma-related morbidity mortality place heavy economic burden family society . There consensus adverse asthma outcome ameliorate individual 's active engagement adequate self-management . This multi-site randomized control study proposes implement evaluate peer-led asthma self-management adolescent ( PLASMA ) program demonstrate feasibility preliminary efficacy previous study . PLASMA implement three city ( Buffalo NY , Baltimore MD , Memphis TN ) particularly high rate pediatric asthma asthma-related morbidity , thus likely benefit program . PLASMA comprise three main component : ( ) peer-leader training ; ( b ) one-day asthma camp peer leader deliver manualized self-management content recommend national guideline ; ( c ) bi-monthly peer-leader contact . Specific aim : ( 1 ) evaluate effectiveness PLASMA inner-city adolescent asthma improve quality life ( primary outcome ) , asthma knowledge , attitude , outcome expectation , self-efficacy , self-management skill , asthma control , FEV1 ( exploratory outcome ) time , compare control group adult leader deliver program content ; ( 2 ) examine mediate effect exploratory outcome quality life ; ( 3 ) examine moderate effect personal factor ( e.g. , age , sex , family support ) intervention 's primary exploratory outcome ; ( 4 ) evaluate effect PLASMA study outcome peer leader ( 16-20 year ) ; ( 5 ) determine economic impact intervention . These aim accomplish use two-group randomize control trial 378 adolescent ( 12-17 year ) three city ( 126 site ) . A total 42 qualify peer leader ( 14 site ) enrol base adult nomination . Eligibility criterion peer leader adolescent learner include : current asthma diagnosis ; persistent asthma ; absence chronic mental illness ; inner-city residence ; capability verbal write communication English . Participants provide data enrollment ( T1 ) , camp ( T2 ) , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12- , 15-months post-camp ( T3-T7 ) . Data analyze use multi-site hierarchical three-level linear mixed-effects model level 1 represent repeat measure , level 2 = subject , level 3 = site . To determine economic impact program , investigator measure direct healthcare cost total cost program , perform net cost analysis type cost . In addition , investigator estimate cost-effectiveness ratio PLASMA group compare control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peer Led Asthma Self Management Adolescents : PLASMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma , common pediatric chronic condition , serious problem many adolescent . In 2010 , nearly 11 % adolescent ( 2.7 million ) age 12 17 year US report current asthma . This age cohort suffers great asthma-related morbidity mortality young child . Asthma disproportionately affect inner-city youth , asthma severity increase achieve optimum asthma control elusive . Several factor include poor socioeconomic condition , life stress , environmental trigger find associate poorly control asthma inner-city child . Programs target asthma inner-city child primarily focus modification environmental factor address disparity healthcare access . Limited intervention effort direct address high inner-city asthma morbidity specifically adolescents promote adequate self-management . Dr. Rhee successfully complete R21 ( NR009837 ) design evidence-based peer-led asthma self-management adolescent ( PLASMA ) program test efficacy randomize parallel group design 112 urban suburban adolescent persistent asthma . The PLASMA program implement one-day camp involve monthly follow-up peer leader . The program well receive participant , relative adolescent receive adult-led program , PLASMA group report good quality life asthma control few asthma-related urgent office visit . Subgroup analysis reveal program particularly effective inner-city adolescent improve asthma outcome compare suburban participant . Given disproportionate burden asthma inner-city youth program 's compelling effect population , focus inner-city adolescent target PLASMA program critical . Building previous trial efficacy , overall goal propose study evaluate effectiveness generalizability peer-led intervention , PLASMA , improve asthma outcome inner-city adolescent three metropolitan city Northern , Eastern Southern US distinctive historical cultural background . Multisite study advocate effective approach strengthen external validity study afford opportunity assess extent treatment effect generalizable different setting . Ascertaining generalizability across site important guide future translation study finding policy practice . This study also determine long-term sustainability PLASMA effect estimate economic impact intervention . This multi-site study significant target understudied population , inner-city adolescent asthma three city US , present serious challenge optimum asthma management . Specific study aim : 1 . To evaluate systematically effectiveness peer-led asthma program inner-city adolescent persistent asthma . This aim accomplish use two-group randomize control trial 378 adolescent ( 12-17 year ) three city . The intervention group receive PLASMA involve peer leader training , one-day intense asthma self-management program lead peer leader bimonthly contact peer leader . Intervention effect examine comparison control group , receive program content deliver adult leader . Investigators hypothesize : relative control group , PLASMA group report great improvement time ( H1 ) quality life ( primary outcome ) , ( H2 ) asthma knowledge , attitude , outcome expectation , self-efficacy , self-management skill , asthma control , FEV1 ( exploratory outcome ) . ( H3 ) The post-PLASMA score outcome measure high pre-program score treatment group . 2 . To examine mediate effect secondary outcome ( knowledge , attitude , outcome expectation , self-efficacy , self-management skill , asthma control , FEV1 ) primary outcome ( quality life ) intervention . 3 . To examine moderating effect personal factor ( e.g. , age , sex , family support ) primary secondary outcome intervention . 4 . To evaluate effect PLASMA primary exploratory outcome peer leader ( 16-20 year ) . Investigators hypothesize peer leader ( n=42 ) report significant improvement quality life ( primary outcome ) secondary outcome ( knowledge , attitude , outcome expectation , self-efficacy , self-management skill , asthma control FEV1 ) course 15 month . 5 . To determine economic impact intervention . This aim accomplish ( 5a ) measure direct healthcare cost total cost PLASMA program , compare control group ; ( 5b ) perform net cost analysis type cost ; ( 5c ) estimate cost-effectiveness ratio PLASMA group compare control . Investigators hypothesize direct overall cost per participant PLASMA group less cost per participant control group , cost neutral .</detailed_description>
