	<brief_summary>This study perform comply regulatory requirement new non-antiarrhythmic drug must assess potential effect cardiac repolarization electrocardiographic evaluation 'Thorough QT/ Corrected QT interval ( TQT ) ' study . This two part study , Part A open-label , single oral dose study design order evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability 500 milligram ( mg ) dose GSK1278863 Part B single-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , single , oral dose , four-way crossover study design . Parts A B conduct healthy adult subject 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , clinical laboratory safety test , vital sign measurement , physical examination , adverse event report , pharmacokinetic sample collect throughout study .</brief_summary>
