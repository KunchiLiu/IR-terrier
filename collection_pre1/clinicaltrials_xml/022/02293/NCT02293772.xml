	<detailed_description>A loss body weight document lowland-living individual expose hypoxic environment , high altitude , laboratory condition . This weight loss attribute reduced appetite ( subsequent fall dietary energy intake ) , increase rest energy expenditure . Interestingly , reduction appetite energy intake also report space flight , although mechanism explain . As gas inside future planetary habitat likely low partial pressure oxygen Earth 's atmospheric air , hypoxia induce appetite reduction could pose challenge individual environment . For example , persistent under-eating could compromise long term health due inadequate intake essential micronutrient , especially presence alter nutrient metabolism requirement see space flight . Moreover , inadequate macronutrient intake could exacerbate loss lean body tissue occur situation ( microgravity , inactivity bed rest ) muscle unloaded . Indeed , protein intake great normal could require situation muscle inactivity , achieve postprandial anabolic effect amino acid see ambulatory individual . The mechanism reduction appetite observe hypoxia well establish . Several incretin hormone adipokines implicate control appetite may candidate induce alteration appetite observe hypoxia . However , report literature present contradictory finding , perhaps due use different experimental paradigm ( hypobaric normobaric hypoxia , active resting subject , variability degree duration hypoxia ) . The protocol current study standardise physical activity , ambient temperature , hypoxic stimulus nutritional composition diet , aim extend knowledge effect hypoxia bedrest appetite hormonal control . In order discern separate combine effect microgravity hypoxia , fourteen normal over-weight men , otherwise healthy , recruit follow medical psychological screening . They invite attend Olympic Sport Centre , Planica , Slovenia 3 occasion , visit 31 day duration separate 5 month . Each 31-day visit ( 'campaign ' ) include baseline record period ( 5 day ) , 21 day intervention recovery period ( 5 day ) , 3 intervention allocate randomize , cross design : ) Normobaric normoxic bed rest ( NBR ; FiO2=21 % ) , ii ) Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement ( HAMB ; FiO2=14 % ; ~4000 simulate altitude ) , iii ) Normobaric hypoxic bed rest ( HBR ; FiO2=14 % ) . A standardized , repeat , 14-day dietary menu , comprise food commonly consume Slovenian diet , applied campaign , target energy intake calculate individually use modify Benedict-Harris formula physical activity factor multiplier 1.2 HBR NBR campaign 1.4 HAMB campaign . Food provide weighed portion subject encourage eat food supply . However , food eaten weigh actual amount consume record diet analysis programme . Body mass assess daily campaign use gurney incorporate load cell , whole body composition determine immediately intervention use fan beam dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry . Participants undergo mixed meal tolerance test day 17 intervention period , morning , 12 hour fast , time assessment replicate study day every campaign . On arrival , participant rest supine hospital bed place hand heat hand warm unit ( air temperature 50-55oC ) . An intravenous cannula insert retrograde dorsal hand vein arterialised-venous blood sampling . After 15mins rest , baseline , fast blood sample take determination serum insulin , total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , adiponectin leptin , whole blood glucose lactate , plasma catecholamine , ghrelin , PeptideYY ( PYY ) , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , triglyceride , non-esterified fatty acid concentration . An expired breath sample collect evacuated tube 13 labelled carbon dioxide ( 13CO2 ) determination , 20min baseline measurement rest energy expenditure ( REE ) respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) make use indirect calorimetry , subject wear mask , inspire expire air measure every breath . Appetite assessment make ask subject rate hunger , desire eat , fullness , prospective food intake , place vertical mark 0-100mm linear scale . This visual analogue scale measure left right , 0 indicate experience variable ( e.g . hungry , unable eat anything ) 100 indicate variable imagine experiencing ( e.g . intense desire eat , completely full ) . Values 4 variable combine calculate combine appetite score ( CAS ) . Once baseline measurement complete , subject consume mixed nutrient milkshake ( Ensure Plus , Abbott Nutrition ) 5ml/kg body weight , supplement ( 1 % carbohydrate content ) 13-Carbon label ( 13C ) Glucose . Arterialised venous blood sample subsequently take every 10min glucose lactate assessment , every 20min assessment serum insulin incretin hormone . A measurement REE RER perform last 15min every 30min period follow 2 hour assess fuel oxidation metabolic rate , expire breath sample collect evacuated tube 13CO2 determination later date . Subjective appetite assess every 15minutes throughout use visual analogue scale , describe , end 2hr postprandial period subject give ad libitum pasta-based test meal instruct eat feel comfortably full . This meal comprise cooked dried white pasta , commercially available tomato-based pasta sauce , olive oil grate hard cheese , composition 37 % total energy derive fat , 48 % carbohydrate , 16 % protein . The amount eaten record related subjective appetite rating .</detailed_description>
