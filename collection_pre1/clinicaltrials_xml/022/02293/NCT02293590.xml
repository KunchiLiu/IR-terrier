	<detailed_description>Certolizumab pegol ( CZP ) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) antagonist market treatment moderate severe rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) ( Keystone , 2008 ) give combination methotrexate ( MTX ) . CZP PEGylated Fab ' fragment humanize anti-TNF antibody high affinity TNF . RA chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease multiple treatment strategy combination therapy available include analgesia , anti-inflammatory drug disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug . Previous trial demonstrate positive result use CZP compare use placebo fix dose concomitant medication regime rather use realistic dynamic treatment strategy normally employ clinical outpatient care RA . This trial aim compare use CZP patient moderate severe RA administer conjunction intensive , adapt treatment strategy ( Group A ) versus fixed-dosed program ( Group B ) . CZP give conjunction MTX ( disease modify anti-arthritic drug - DMARD ) , steroidal therapy form prednisolone joint infiltration triamcinolone ( another corticosteroid ) lidocaine ( pain therapy ) . Both treatment arm include concomitant medication intensive adaptive approach adopt 'treat target ' population Group A fixed-dose approach set-out Group B . Patients centrally randomize screening ensure 50:50 ratio Groups study . STUDY HYPOTHESIS Tight control adaptive concomitant treatment strategy initiation CZP lead improve outcome RA patient active disease despite DMARD treatment .</detailed_description>
