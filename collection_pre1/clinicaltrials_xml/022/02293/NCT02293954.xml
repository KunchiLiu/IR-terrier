	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study copper Cu 64 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) monoclonal antibody M5A positron emission tomography ( PET ) diagnose patient CEA positive cancer . Diagnostic procedure , copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A PET , may help find diagnose CEA positive cancer may detect standard diagnostic method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copper Cu 64 Anti-CEA Monoclonal Antibody M5A PET Diagnosing Patients With CEA Positive Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability 64Cu label M5A antibody ( copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A ) localize CEA positive cancer ( gastrointestinal , lung , medullary thyroid breast cancer ) , determine PET image . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize frequency titer human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) response 64Cu label M5A antibody . II . To determine safety administration 64Cu label M5A antibody . OUTLINE : Patients receive copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously ( IV ) day 0 undergo PET day 1 day 2 . After completion study , patient follow 1 3 month .</detailed_description>
