	<brief_summary>Objectives : Objectives The primary objective study : To assess 4-month disease control rate ( DCR ) pre-treated patient unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) treat alisertib The secondary objective study : To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed complete + partial response ) To assess progression-free survival . To assess overall survival . To evaluate side effect toxicity associate treatment regimen . To collect archival tissue , blood , pleural effusion fluid plasma correlative study . Exploratory Objectives : To collect archival new tissue , blood pleural effusion fluid correlative study . Tissue biomarkers evaluate include aurora kinase pathway c-myc gene amplification . Next generation sequencing ( NGS ) conduct adequate tumor tissue specimen .</brief_summary>
