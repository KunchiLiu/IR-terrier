	<criteria>Is HCV positive ( documented HCV RNA test Screening ) . Chronic hepatitis C define ) Positive antiHCV antibody , HCV RNA , HCV genotype least 6 month screen , positive HCV RNA antiHCV antibody time screening ; b ) Positive antiHCV antibody HCV RNA time screen liver biopsy consistent chronic HCV infection ( liver biopsy perform enrollment evidence CHC disease , presence fibrosis ) , accord `` Guidance Industry . Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection : Developing DirectActing Antiviral Agents Treatment '' . Has previous result HCV genotype testing . If previous result available , test perform Screening . Has liver biopsy Fibroscan™ within 3 year severity hepatic dysfunction limit follow : Metavir Stage 0 stage 3 fibrosis ( accord liver biopsy ) Fibroscan™ result ALT AST value exceed 5 x ULN ( Baseline value parameter calculate average 3 value obtain 7 day apart Normal total bilirubin , prothrombin time/INR value Has elevate liver test result ( ALT ) least 1.5 x ULN exceed 5 x ULN ( Baseline value parameter calculate average 3 value obtain 7 day apart Is refractory null responder , intolerable , relapser , partial responder . Null responder define less 2 log10 IU/mL reduction HCV RNA 12 week treatment standard Peg Interferon/ribavirin antiHCV therapy ; Relapser define HCV RNA undetectable ( negative , per site 's definition ) end stage treatment standard pegylated interferonbased regimen antiHCV therapy , HCV RNA detectable posttreatment followup ; The intolerable defined HCV patient tolerate side effect previous interferonbased therapy antiHCV therapy , suitable interferonbased therapy antiHCV therapy ; Partial responder define achieve 2 log10 IU/mL reduction HCV RNA Week 12 ( ± 1 week ) prior pegIFN/RBV treatment course antiHCV therapy fail achieve HCV RNA undetectable end stage treatment . 1 .
