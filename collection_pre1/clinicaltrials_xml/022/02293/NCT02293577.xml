	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Youth With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TODAY study study report disappointing result intensive life-style program alone combination metformin maintain optimal control type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) adolescent . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) successful lifestyle modification adult T2D use CGM study youth T2D . Thus feasibility technology evaluate patient population may prove effective adjunct treatment future . Youth type 2 diabetes approach enrollment study . The study explain volunteer meet eligibility criterion inform consent/assent obtain . Demographic data record . A medical history perform . A urine pregnancy test ( woman ) measure confirm eligibility . Height , weight , BMI , percent body fat , fat mass , fat free mass measure . Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) measure . After enrollment blind CGM place . CGM device insert skin abdomen monitor glucose level every 5 minute , record information . CGM commonly wear kid type 1 diabetes . The study allow collection information glucose variability much great detail see intermittent fingerstick glucose value oral glucose tolerance test . Subjects meet nutritionist learn keep food record . They give empty food record complete day . They also give accelerometer instruct use , however remain blinded data obtain . The study 5 day length . Subjects urge continue normal eating activity behavior . During study period blood sugar CGM data record via glucometer sensor downloads , dietary intake via food record , activity via accelerometer . Glucometer test blood glucose require least every 12 hour calibrate CGM . To minimize need overnight test calibrate CGM , subject ask check blood sugar use glucometer 3 time day , preferably fast morning breakfast , dinner , bedtime . To optimize accuracy dietary intake record , subject contact frequently food record information record study personnel . Subjects give `` morning checklist '' keep visible area improve compliance remind keep study device day . At follow-up visit CGM download reveal blood glucose tracing study period . Additionally complete food record collect accelerometer download .</detailed_description>
