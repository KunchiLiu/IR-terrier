	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia world , affect 1-2 % general population 10 % people older 80 year old . Medical therapy partially effective treatment symptom atrial fibrillation ablation procedure develop offer potential curative approach treatment symptom atrial fibrillation . Prior ablation procedure , standard care perform imaging ( either contrast cardiac compute tomography cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging ) determine size orientation pulmonary vein , presence absence leave atrial thrombus size volume leave atrium . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging advantage high spatial resolution without additional radiation exposure . There additional feature CMR make potentially even useful patient undergo ablation procedure treatment atrial fibrillation . One main advantage involve use delayed-enhancement MRI ( DE-MRI ) characterize tissue leave atrium visualize presence absence scar . Prior study demonstrate ability CMR visualize radiofrequency-induced scar leave atrial wall atrial fibrillation ablation . These study postulate CMR could utilize determine success rate atrial fibrillation ablation . However , significant variability publish study look CMR post radiofrequency ablation , many year type ablation procedure available treat atrial fibrillation . Some study demonstrate correlation DE-MRI ablation lesion , others report correlation . Furthermore , study date design examine cryoablation specifically . Cryoablation alternative method perform ablation procedure utilize freeze balloon make circumferential lesion around atrum pulmonary vein , opposed radiofrequency ablation use catheter create pattern lesion around pulmonary vein utilize 4mm catheter generates heat byproduct radiofrequency energy . Using DE-MRI analyze injury scar cryoablation would novel application image modality . There several reason lesion produce cryoablation procedure may offer good visualization DE-MRI compare radiofrequency ablation . First , circumferential lesion generate cryoablation create utilizing uniform distribution energy simultaneous fashion entire pulmonary vein antrum . In contrast , lesion create radiofrequency ablation produce sequentially lesion variable contact myocardium therefore variable energy delivery . As consequence , lesion create radiofrequency ablation may uniformly penetrate myocardium , create situation whereby contiguous lesion variable depth . This may explain heterogeneity scar visualization DE-MRI early study . Furthermore , despite advantage accuracy electroanatomical mapping , due variation tissue architecture pulmonary vein antrum , may technical challenge ensure truly contiguous lesion . Unfortunately , non-contiguous nature radiofrequency ablation lesion may become evident localized tissue edema subside clinical evidence recurrent atrial fibrillation observe several month procedure . Cryoablation offer theoretical advantage regard produce near uniform tissue contact well ability ass gap tissue contact inject contrast dye fluoroscopic visualization period pulmonary vein occlusion demonstrate area poor tissue contact contrast dye escape occlude pulmonary vein . Another advantage cryoballoon contact great amount myocardium pulmonary vein antrum radiofrequency ablation catheter due large surface area 23 28mm diameter cryoballoon compare 3.5 4mm diameter radiofrequency ablation catheter . The small surface area radiofrequency ablation lesion may miss delay enhancement sequence MRI , acquire great slice thickness compare standard acquisition . Therefore , cryoablation lesion may likely visualize , great probability portion ablate myocardium present give image slice delay enhance atrial myocardium . Finally , nature cryoablation may cause less inflammation short term atrial myocardium compare radiofrequency ablation due fact tissue frozen heat . The effect ability visualize ablate tissue DE-MRI unknown , none publish study examine cryoablation specifically .</detailed_description>
