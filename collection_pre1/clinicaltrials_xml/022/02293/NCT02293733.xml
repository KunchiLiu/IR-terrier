	<brief_title>Retrospective Study Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : â€¢ Lung cancer represent lead cause death cancer France . Significant advance make recent year knowledge oncogenesis NSCLC particularly discovery specific oncogenic driver play major role oncogenic addiction responsible occurrence NSCLC . Activating mutation gene encode receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR appear subgroup patient NSCLC . In 2010 , search EGFR mutation patient lung cancer perform 16,834 patient mutation rate 10.5 % . The use specific inhibitor EGFR tyrosine kinase patient activate mutation EGFR show significant clinical benefit response rate 70 % , PFS range 9 13,1 month median overall survival 20 30 month . Despite good result , patient develop resistance EGFR TKI . This progression usually define accord RECIST criterion . These RECIST criterion establish primarily study conduct patient treated conventional chemotherapy target therapy . In addition , mode action TKI ( block signal pathway involve cell proliferation , angiogenesis , apoptosis , metastasis .. ) different mode cytotoxic action ( action cell division ) . Thus , use RECIST seem appropriate way evaluate response patient treat TKI . Despite , RECIST criterion use demonstrate superiority EGFR TKI compare chemotherapy patient EGFR activate mutation first line set . In 2010 , Pr Jackman propose clinical definition acquire resistance EGFR TKI : 1 . Treatment single agent EGFR TKI , 2 . Presence EGFR activate mutation , clinical benefit treatment EGFR TKI 3 . Systemic progression disease accord RECIST WHO criteria continuous treatment EGFR TKI within last 30 day TKI 4 . No intervene systemic therapy cessation EGFR TKI initiation new therapy . Tony Mok , accompany editorial , make criticism definition . He argue uncommon find new small slow grow tumor nodule dramatic initial response EGFR TKIs . He state situation , EGFR TKIs could continue benefit patient . Since , others clinical situation describe , emergence one even new metastasis locate one single organ ( like brain bone ) , control loco-regional treatment . The author find continuation EGFR TKIs case allow control disease considerable length time . More recently , suggest even loco-regional treatment mandatory EGFR TKIs continuation . Pr Nishino study retrospectively 56 patient EGFR activate mutation acquire resistance . 88 % patient continue EGFR TKI treatment least 2 month beyond progressive disease define accord RECIST criterion . The median time RECIST progressive disease termination TKI patient 10.1 month ( range 2.2 64.2 month ) median overall survival 31.8 month , rather good result . Pr Oxnard , similar study , find 45 % 42 patient acquire resistance EGFR TKI , alternate systemic therapy could delay three month . These 19 patient frequently exon 19 deletion free cancer relate symptom RECIST progressive disease . Another recently publish retrospective Japanese study suggest continuous use EGFR-TKI beyond progressive disease may prolong overall survival compare switch cytotoxic chemotherapy patient EGFR activate mutation . A prospective ASIAN phase II study ( ASPIRATION ) recently complete . It compare continuous use erlotinib versus stop erlotinib progression accord RECIST criterion . Patients could continue erlotinib progression slow ( &gt; 6 month stability ) , asymptomatic minimal increase and/or new cerebral metastasis control locally . The patient switch another systemic treatment rapid progressive disease , extra brain symptomatic metastasis , deterioration Performance Status ( PS ) life threaten complication . The result study available December 2014 . Purpose : The purpose retrospective study describe circumstance EGFR TKI continue despite progression accord usual RECIST criterion patient EGFR activate mutation acquire resistance EGFR TKI . This study concern patient begin TKI treatment first line 1st JANUARY 2010 1st JUNE 2012.We 'll collect social demographic data ( age , sex ) , first PFS ( start EGFR TKI : PFS 1 ) second ( first progression accord RECIST 1.1 second progression : PFS2 ) , OS ( diagnosis OS 1 first progression OS2 ) , mutational status , analyze closely mode progression ( site ) , therapeutic approach disease progression . We define two subgroup : EGFR TKI continue least three month despite progression define accord RECIST criterion , second-line treatment ( chemotherapy without EGFR TKI ) choose disease progression . It individualize subgroup patient continue TKI progression . In subgroup , search correlation delay systemic therapy ( second line ) pursue EGFR TKI least 3 month various parameter : - Type EGFR mutation - Symptoms disease progression - Clinical characteristic - Emergence new metastasis vs increase size know target - Speed decay tumour progression ( % per month ) - Delivery loco-regional treatment relapse occur single site - PFS ( PFS1 PFS2 ) OS ( OS1 ) first progression group compare general population ( population TKI stop progression ) EGFR activate mutation .</detailed_description>
