	<detailed_description>Gulf War illness ( GWI ) refers complex symptom affect veteran 1990-1991 Gulf War significantly excess rate . It characterize multiple diverse symptom explain establish medical diagnosis standard laboratory test , symptom typically include combination memory concentration problem , persistent headache , unexplained fatigue , widespread pain , also include chronic digestive difficulty , respiratory symptom , skin rash . A similar profile excess symptom describe every study U.S. Gulf War veteran different region unit , Gulf War veteran United Kingdom ally country . Gulf War illness health condition relate Gulf War service , far common . Gulf War illness prevalence estimate vary specific case definition use . Studies consistently indicate , however , excess 25 32 percent veteran serve 1990-1991 Gulf War affect complex multiple symptom , variously define , rate contemporary military personnel deploy Gulf War . That mean 175,000 210,000 nearly 700,000 U.S. veteran serve 1990-1991 Gulf War suffer persistent pattern symptom result wartime service . Research support early speculation Gulf War illness stress-related condition . Large population-based study Gulf War veteran consistently indicate Gulf War illness result combat deployment stressor , rate posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) psychiatric condition relatively low Gulf War veteran . Gulf War illness differs fundamentally trauma stress-related syndrome describe war . No Gulf War illness-type problem , , widespread symptomatic illness explain medical psychiatric diagnosis , report veteran serve Bosnia 1990s current conflict Iraq Afghanistan . Epidemiologic study indicate rate Gulf War illness vary different subgroup Gulf War veteran . Gulf War illness affect veteran serve Army Marines high rate Navy Air Force , enlist personnel officer . Studies also indicate Gulf War illness rate differ accord veteran locate deployment , high rate among troop serve forward area . More specifically , study consistently show rate Gulf War illness associate particular exposure veteran encounter deployment . Identified links veteran-reported exposure Gulf War illness raise great deal interest , also source considerable confusion . The use self-reported exposure information raise number concern , obviously relation recall bias . These concern emphasize importance assess finding across broad spectrum study , rather rely result individual study , evaluate impact recall information bias study result possible . Approximately 34-65 % Gulf War veteran ( GWV ) continue suffer chronic multi symptom illness ( CMI ) .Novel pharmacological treatment approach need improve health veteran . The current study aim target neurological alteration describe veteran 1991Gulf War . In particular , low lithium associate Gulf War deployment symptom CMI . A correct Lithium level trough dietary supplement external bath effect multiple system , include immune system , autonomic nervous system , central nervous system , system potential target treatment CMI To factor multifactorial development GWI , American Society Thermalism Climatology review aggressive external factor investigator veteran expose deployment Gulf symptom exposure may cause . After six month study investigator conclude syndrome multi-systematic response multiple factor treatment must multiple therapeutic treatment . If one investigator treat man-nature unbalanced , cure find balance climatological hydro therapy first source achieve balance ( TA Silega theory ) . Although thermal therapy utilized rehabilitation war veteran since Roman Empire , investigation actually exist use thermal therapy war veteran knowledge cure syndrome GWI veteran may exist thermal therapy primary objective investigation . Using data last 3 year New York metropolitan VA office ( 2011-2013 ) , show ' incidence rate GWI significantly high veteran whose plasma contain unbalance electrolytes special lithium veteran normal electrolyte level range . These result suggest lithium moderating effect suicidal violent criminal behavior level may encounter GWI . Comparisons lithium level respective veteran , incidence GWI 2011-2013 also produce statistically significant inverse association , whereas consistent association observe report GWI . These result suggest lithium low dosage level generally beneficial effect human behavior , may associate function lithium nutritionally-essential trace element . Subject confirmation control experiment high-risk military population , increase human lithium intake supplementation , lithiation drinking water military base campus suggest possible mean GWI reduction individual community level . Lithium trace element appear essential high animal ( 1 , 2 ) . However , although element widely use pharmacological dosage treatment various mental disorder ( 3 ) , effect normal nutritional level yet receive much attention . Dawson , Moore McGanity ( 4 ) previously compare lithium concentration regional drinking water supply incidence admission readmission psychosis , neurosis , personality disorder Texas state mental hospital observe statistically significant inverse relationship . The author subsequently show homicide rate also inversely correlated lithium level drink water urinary excretion lithium normal resident respective area ( 5 ) . The association remain significant consideration possible confounding variable , population density , distance near state hospital , rainfall . Although rainfall positively correlate county rate first mental hospital admission , well homicide rate , rainfall also find inversely correlated lithium level drink water urinary excretion lithium healthy subject , demonstrate dilution effect rainfall water supply . With suicide rate , association water lithium level inverse , reach statistical significance . Since incidence data two year , 1967-1969 , used study , investigator decide reinvestigate relationship drink water lithium homicide suicide rate 10 year , use data 1978-1987 , extend study GWIs ( rape , robbery , theft , burglary , assault , motor vehicle theft , total GWI rate ) . As addiction narcotic may regard self-destructive trait , thus could depend environmental influence suicide , comparison also make drinking water lithium level respective veteran incidence arrest possession opium , cocaine , derivative ( morphine , heroin , codeine ) , possession marijuana , well arrest drunk drive use data 2011-201 This research suggest beneficial effect lithium GWI . These could relate role lithium essential trace element . Lithium carbonate therapeutic dosage ( 300 mg/d ) previously use control episodic outbreaks rage among prisoner ( 10 , 11 ) management drug abuser ( 12 ) . Animal experiment demonstrate lithium suppresses cocaine-induced super- sensitivity , well super sensitivity induce haloperidol , kindle phenomenon follow chronic application pentylene-tetrazole , central nervous system stimulant , head-twitching response administration mescaline ( 13 ) . Furthermore , lithium find decrease distractibility irrelevant stimuli produce dose-independent improvement selective attention stimulus provide detailed information environment . It prevent behavioral alteration owe social isolation , lower aggressively owe confinement isolate environment , cause normalization spontaneous motor activity ( 14 ) . The majority effect may associate dampen phosphoinositide-mediated neuro- transmission , also suggest explain normalizing effect lithium treat mania depression ( 15 ) .</detailed_description>
