	<brief_summary>GSK2618960 humanize Immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) bind alpha component ( CD127 ) heterodimeric Interleukin-7 receptor ( IL-7R ) . It develop treatment autoimmune indication . This study intend explore safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) immunogenicity single ascending dos GSK2618960 healthy volunteer beyond already evaluate I7R116702 ( First Time In Human study ) . The study anticipate enrol 18 subject total , 9 subject two cohort .</brief_summary>

Nonchildbearing potential define : premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy , postmenopausal define 24 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit ( MIU ) per millilitre ( mL ) oestradiol &lt; 40 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 140 picomole/liter ) confirmatory . [ Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study . ] Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list Protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 5 halflives infusion ( Week 16 visit ) . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinically significant abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside local reference range use healthy volunteer may include Investigator consultation GSK Medical Monitor agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure .

One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ~240 mL beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Previous history anaphylaxis severe allergic reaction . Receipt live vaccination within 1 month screening plan receive live vaccination time study i.e . 6 month follow dosing ( cover period predict target duration receptor occupancy &gt; = 95 % ) . Subjects high risk area world tuberculosis history tuberculosis close family member confirm TB infection positive screening Quantiferon testing ( indeterminate test result screen may repeat ) . Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface and/or core antibody positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen A positive prestudy drug screen . A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . Other Criteria Smokers would able refrain smoke whilst phase I unit . Unable refrain use prescription nonprescription drug ( unless permit per protocol Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day `` rolling '' period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
