	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinical performance ReLeaf infusion catheter &amp; wound drain patient follow lumbar spinal fusion surgery . One half patient receive continuous local analgesic fusion post-operative period half receive continuous local saline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation ReLeaf Analgesic Infusion Catheter &amp; Wound Drain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posterior lumbar spinal fusion commonly use management wide array spinal disorder range instability degenerative disc disease . However , severe postoperative pain significant adverse outcome patient undergone lumbar spinal fusion procedure . This pain may delay mobilization decrease compliance physical , occupational , pulmonary physiotherapy . Pain symptom may worsen activity ambulation due reflex spasm paraspinal muscle elicit pain wound . A local anesthetic agent administer immediately surgery tissue surround wound address pain source less four hour . Therefore , reasonable consider continuous local anesthetic infusion , may limit local pain mediator long duration . Continuous local anesthetic infusion paraspinal musculature ReLeaf catheter potential reduce pain , narcotic demand &amp; usage , accelerate rate recovery lumbar spinal fusion patient .</detailed_description>
