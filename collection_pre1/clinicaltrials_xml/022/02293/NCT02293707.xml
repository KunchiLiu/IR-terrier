	<brief_summary>GX301 experimental therapeutic vaccine direct human telomerase , enzyme play essential role cancer cell proliferation . This clinical trial test three different GX301 administration regimens castration-resistant prostate cancer patient achieve response disease stability first-line docetaxel treatment . This aim identify optimal vaccination regimen . The three regimen primarily compare efficacy safety induce vaccine-specific immunological response period 6 month follow treatment initiation . In addition , patient observe occurrence disease progression vital status 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Randomised Trial Three Regimens GX301 Vaccination Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GX301 , experimental therapeutic ( anti-cancer ) vaccine , compose four immunogenic peptide human telomerase two complementary adjuvant , Montanide ISA-51 VG imiquimod . An early Phase 1 study GX301 provide evidence vaccine-specific immune response small sample stage 4 prostate cancer patient give eight GX301 administration 9 week . The present Phase 2 , randomise , parallel-group , multicentre trial aim compare three different GX301 administration regimens patient progressive , castration-resistant prostate cancer complete first-line docetaxel treatment achieve response chemotherapy disease stability . Primary comparison include regimen efficacy induce vaccine-specific immunological response period 6 month follow randomisation ; treatment safety tolerability period . A study aim investigate whether achievement immunological response , irrespective assign GX301 regimen , relate progression-free and/or overall survival . Eligible patient randomly assign receive one three GX301 vaccination regimens consist two , four eight administration , respectively , regimen give fixed 9-week period . Randomisation ratio 1:1:1 . Randomisation stratify previous cumulative exposure docetaxel . Following randomisation , immunological response GX301 determine 6-month period . However , on-study patient observation continue occurrence one follow end-points , whichever early : ( ) disease progression ; ( b ) death ; ( c ) completion 18-month observation period ; ( ) patient 's decision terminate participation study . All patient discharge trial reason ( ) ( c ) undergo follow-up ascertain survival 24 month randomisation . Data analysis carry two sequential step . The first step focus co-primary outcome therefore take place upon completion study dataset 6-month time-point . The second step incorporate secondary outcome therefore conduct upon completion full study dataset .</detailed_description>
