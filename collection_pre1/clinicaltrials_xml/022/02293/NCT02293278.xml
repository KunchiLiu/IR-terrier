	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Significance : Objective measure physical activity ( PA ) use accelerometer ( motion sensor wear hip ) reveal preschooler level sedentary behaviour high , level moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) low ( Pate et al. , 2004 , Reilly et al. , 2004 , 2006 ) . Inquiry preschooler daily level PA suggest 2.6 % 4 % waking hour spend MVPA ( Reilly , 2004 , 2006 ; Montgomery et al . 2004 ) , , pre-school hour , Pate colleague find 3 5 year old child engage 7.7 minute MVPA . A recent study Canadian preschooler find remarkably similar level MVPA ( Temple et al. , 2009 ) , include 12.3 minute MVPA per day 39.5 minute sedentary behaviour per hour . Although Pate et al . 2004 find boy high level MVPA girl , detect difference level sedentary behaviour , constitute vast majority time boys girl . The finding suggest young child inactive therefore may risk adverse health consequence related physical inactivity . Opportunities PA motor development early childhood may , lifespan , influence health behaviours potential maintain healthy body weight . Fundamental movement skill ( e.g. , catch , throw , jumping , run , etc . ) essential building block acquisition refine complicated skill apply later life , sport , recreational physical activity ( Gallahue et al . 2002 ; Carson 1994 ; Seefeldt , 1979 ) . However , movement skill develop potential without opportunity practice environment stimulate supportive ( Kelly et al. , 1989 ; Taggart &amp; Keegan , 1997 ) . Butcher &amp; Eaton find preschooler movement competence already influence PA choice level . It mastery motor skill ability child incorporate skill game , dance , sport one 's culture provide stimulus movement contribute long-term health ( Seefeldt &amp; Vogel , 1987 ) . There paucity information current trend PA preschool age child , relationship ability child perform fundamental movement skill prediction PA ( Mackenzie et al 2003 ) . The study note indicate preschool age child come close physically active enough accrue health benefit . In fact , although evidence much type PA necessary optimize health development preschool-aged child somewhat unclear ( Timmons et al. , 2007 ) , expert consensus suggest preschool-aged child sedentary 60 minute time , except sleep , engage least 60 minute ( several hour ) structure ( facilitate day care provider , parent , etc . ) 60 minute unstructured PA daily , well 180 min total PA ( National Association Sport &amp; Physical Education , NASPE , 2002 ) . In keep settings-based approach health promotion , acknowledge influence place behaviour ( Dooris et al . 2007 ) , believe powerful influence child 's PA level social physical environment spend time ( Bower et al. , 2008 ; Dowda et al. , 2004 ; Finn eta l. , 2002 ) . Over half Canadian child age 6 month 5 year form nonparental/guardian care 2002-2003 , child spend average 29 hour week day care setting ( Bushnik , 2006 ; Silver 2000 ) . The majority Canadian child two parent single parent family fall category 77 % two parent family 75 % single parent family rely day care child . As , pay child day care set provide ideal opportunity examine enhance movement skill PA behaviours preschool-aged child . There small body evidence suggest group preschool child care setting , policy practice strongly influence child 's PA ( Finn et al. , 2002 ; Pate et al. , 2004 ; Bower et al. , 2008 ) , efficacy intervention day care centre setting preschool child 's PA inactivity behaviour yet determine . The current PA intervention program base upon Healthy Opportunities Preschoolers manual program develop successfully pilot feasibility 3 5 year old preschooler Drs . Viviene Temple , Justen O'Connor , Patti-Jean Naylor . Drs Temple Naylor researcher University Victoria , co-investigators study ( Temple et al. , 2009 ) . We use randomize controlled trial design build previous work evaluate efficacy physical activity intervention train manual program increase PA ( slight modification edit Healthy Opportunities Preschoolers train manual ) . The Preschoolers Activity Trial develop socio-ecological perspective recognize behaviour affect multiple level influence : intrapersonal , interpersonal , organizational/environmental , community policy level . ( Burkman &amp; Kawachi , 2000 ) . The program environmentally-based intervention focus child care set influence child 's life . Recent research demonstrate potential focusing setting modify health promoting behaviour eating , PA tobacco use ( Snyder et al. , 1992 ; Moore et al. , 2001 ; McKenzie et al. , 1994 ) Theoretically , focus set underpinned work community psychologists Barker ( 1968 ) Bronfenbrenner ( 1999 ) . Behaviour setting stable unit affect one individual substantially influence behaviour occurs within ( Barker , 1968 ) . Barker 's research show attribute vary less across child within setting setting . Bronfenbrenner 's ( 1999 ) bio-ecological model expand , highlight importance reciprocal interaction child 's development ; need child engage activity regularly extend period time . Ultimately , effectiveness PA intervention rest ability transfer knowledge day care-providers would motivate change child care program environment child spend time . Despite vary definition , measure effective knowledge transfer exchange knowledge utilization ( Cousins &amp; Leithwood , 1993 ) ; uptake implementation innovation curriculum ( evidence-based practice ) decision-makers practitioner . Study Design Methodology : A Cluster randomize control trial design use day care centre unit measurement ( cluster ) , though analysis also individual subject level give number day care target study . Several large ( non-home base ) day care centre Ottawa represent ethnic diversity varying level socio-economic status ( SES ) invite participate . We send letter daycare express interest , outline objective procedure project , well chance randomly assign either Intervention Control Group . The current intervention design 3-5 year old child attend day care . Of interested day care centre , 3 randomly assign intervention 3 control group . Day care provider centre randomize control group receive educational workshop resource manual involvement study complete ( 6 month post-treatment ) , however child control day care centre evaluate provider receive training . The PA intervention design increase PA reduce sedentary behaviour consist 2 , three-hour workshop training session conduct master trainer experience promote PA preschooler . The training workshop target day care provider 3 5 year old child assign intervention group . The first workshop focus importance PA movement skills pre-school-aged child , understand structure unstructured play , implement HOP day care centre , practical activity relate movement skill . The second workshop focus overcome barrier facilitate PA ; understand range movement skill ; use everyday material facilitate PA active play . Each provider intervention group provide Healthy Opportunities Preschoolers resource train manual , recommended program outlining activity participate often , starter kit equipment form basis training day care provider intervention . The manual full various way provider get child active structure unstructured physical activity , target motor skill development . The aim intervention base aforementioned NASPE ( 2002 ) guideline child sedentary 60 minute time , child accumulate least 60 minute structure PA least 60 minute unstructured ( active play ) day moderate intensity high . Participation Consent : The parent child age 3-5 year , participate day care , give informed consent form take home read . The letter make clear care provider 's participation dependent child participate participation completely voluntary . Participating child receive randomize identification number , use data collection , information confidential . This information link master sheet locked secure location . Data collect solely child parental consent . Questionnaire data : Day care provider group survey understanding Central Health Messages ( CHM ) associate Healthy Opportunities Preschoolers manual , well physical facility day care environment may promote restrict PA . The questionnaire also assess provider attitude , control belief , intention , support PA base Theory Planned Behaviour ( TPB ) . Providers complete questionnaire baseline 2 training workshop . This information use evaluate well predict change child 's PA sedentary behaviour . This questionnaire specifically develop successfully use feasibility collection preliminary outcome data HOP trial conduct Drs . Temple Naylor ( co-investigators ) . Parents participate child send socio-demographics questionnaire ask detail parent 's age , sex , high level education achieve , total parental/family income , height weight . Anthropometry Body Composition Data collect measurement period ( baseline , 3 month 6 month post-intervention workshop ) : - Height - Body weight - Body mass index ( kg/m2 ) ( calculate ) - Body composition ( lean body mass , fat mass , percent body fat ) use Bioelctrical impedance analysis validate preschool population . Physical Activity : Self-reported care provide report PA fraught difficulty subject considerable bias young child ( Adamo et al . 2008 ) . Thus , measure PA objectively use Actical ( mini Mitter Co. , Inc. , Bend , Ore. ) accelerometer small unobtrusive device wear right hip use belt around waist ( young child ) , omni-directional sensor monitor occurrence intensity motion . At measurement period ( baseline , 3- 6- month post workshop intervention ) , child wear activity monitor time awaken ( except showering/bathing waterproof ) time go bed Monday Friday , thus provide subject minimum 4 day PA monitoring . Parents keep log verify time accelerometer take , whether child nap . To account possibility child wear Acticals every day , length time child spend day care differs , proportion PA sedentary behaviour per hour wear time compute , do previously group preschool child ( Temple et al . 2009 ) . Pfeiffer et al 's ( 2006 ) cut point preschool-aged child 's moderate vigorous ( MVPA ) apply . The cut-points 715 count 15 second epoch sample MVPA,1411 count use 15 second epoch sample vigorous PA , less 50 count per hour sedentary behaviour use 15 second epoch sampling . For ease comprehension comparison study , activity data summarize reported activity minute per hour , compute tallied count activity level average across wear time . Only child 4 hour accelerometer data per day include dataset . Acticals use assess overall level PA , PA intensity , energy expenditure baseline , 3- 6- month post-intervention . Fundamental/Gross Motor Skills : We use Test Gross Motor Development -2 ( TGMD-2 ) evaluate effect intervention child 's movement skill ( Ulrich , 2000 ) . The TGMD-2 validate standardized norm-referenced measure 12 common gross motor skill child age 3 11 year ( Evaggelinou et al. , 2002 ) . Reliability Gross Motor composite index target age range child 0.91 ( Ulrich , 2000 ) . Since test take 30-40 minute , conduct sub-group ( 50 % ) child group provide pilot data trend motor skill development inform large definitive RCT test HOP . Children group randomly select TGMD-2 measurement time period ( baseline , 3- month 6-months ) .</detailed_description>
