	<brief_summary>The inflammatory tumor micro-environment consequence driver tumorogenesis . On one hand promote antitumor immune response hand favor development progression cancerous lesion . Factors regulate complex interplay epithelial immune cell still poorly characterize . Extracellular ATP ( eATP ) act purinergic P2X7 receptor ( P2RX7 ) recently emerge key signal pathway immune response . Recent data reveal crucial role P2RX7-NLRP3-Caspase-1 prim dendritic cell ( DC ) within tumor microenvironment upon treatment certain type chemotherapy drug . Despite important discovery , previous study far investigated global vivo effect P2RX7 modulation inflammation-induced carcinogenesis mucosal tissue . Our consortium , endow long stand experience field mucosal immunology , inflammation signaling , already demonstrate P2RX7 differentially express mucosa patient active quiescent inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , eATP present high concentration , P2RX7 control amplification loop inflammatory response ( Cesaro et al. , 2010 ) . Furthermore , uncovered P2RX7 control homeostasis , survival function regulatory T cell ( Hubert et al. , 2010 ) . In addition , recent demonstration P2RX7 deficiency lower mucosal inflammation unexpectedly enhance tumor formation vivo warrant additional effort explore molecular cellular mechanism account effect suggest enhance P2RX7 function may anti-tumor therapeutic effect . These observation emphasize tumor suppressor role P2X7 receptor , warrant investigation well understand molecular mechanism responsible anti-tumor effect suggest enhance function P2X7R could therapeutic effect significant antitumor . Our main objective explore role P2RX7 healthy , inflammatory cancerous colonic mucosa . For map expression protein P2RX7 realize genotype P2RX7 form inflammatory disease cancer colon .</brief_summary>
