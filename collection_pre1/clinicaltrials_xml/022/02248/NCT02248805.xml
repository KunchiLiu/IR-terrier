	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study MGD007 Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-arm open-label , multi-center , Phase 1 dose-escalation study define MTD , describe preliminarily safety , assess PK , immunogenicity , potential anti-tumor activity MGD007 administer either weekly every three week schedule patient relapse refractory metastatic colorectal cancer . In initial phase study , two dose schedule assess dose escalation , weekly every three week administration single agent MGD007 . Following establishment MTD , additional patient enroll two separate dose expansion cohort treatment dose schedule . In segment study , patient benefit MGD007 treatment continue meet eligibility may continue treatment Cycles 2 beyond .</detailed_description>
