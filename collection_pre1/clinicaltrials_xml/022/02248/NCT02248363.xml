	<brief_summary>Chronic pain common health problem cause enormous social cost . A common method treat patient chronic pain problem multimodal rehabilitation ( MMR ) , consist combination physical exercise , cognitive behavioural therapy work training coordinate interdisciplinary team . Our research aim evaluate effectiveness MMR health , quality life , physical activity , return work health economics , long-term goal develop MMR . We aim also evaluate predictive factor good bad treatment outcome order well adapt MMR patient . The project base patient-reported data Swedish Quality Registry Pain Rehabilitation , routinely collect data 35 Swedish specialist MMR clinic part country . Physical activity assess advanced pedometer random select MMR clinic . We expect increase knowledge treatment effect MMR effectively adapt accord patient 's limitation resource . Our project group interdisciplinary active nationwide research network focus chronic pain rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nationwide Evaluation Multimodal Rehabilitation Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic musculoskeletal pain public health problem , frequently cause long-term sickness absence ( &gt; 180 day ) . Societal cost chronic pain immense , direct indirect cost amount 90 billion Swedish crown per year accord Swedish Council Technology Assessment ( SBU ) . Despite , policy aim specifically chronic pain public health problem , also acknowledge later literature . Multimodal rehabilitation ( MMR ) increasingly use method patient group denote combination psychological measure , physical activity/exercise manual physical method , administer multidisciplinary team . Its approach considers patient 's needs bio-psycho-social perspective , include work employment status . At date , MMR commonly offer number specialist clinic throughout Sweden , 90 % ( currently 35 ) connect Swedish Quality Registry Pain Rehabilitation ( SQRP ) purpose collect data work quality improvement research . According late report SBU , medium high evidence available research support MMR effective patient chronic pain , study suggest MMR superior traditional single-treatment program . However , paucity scientific literature respect MMR design optimize result , comparison different MMR design limit . This void cause uncertainty delay improvement exist MMR program treat patient chronic pain . Further , necessary investigate whether report result RCTs systematic review truly apply naturalistic practice setting consecutive non-selective flow patient , may do use research methodology know practice-based evidence prospective observational cohort study design . Our intention present research program therefore clarify effectiveness different MMR design . Furthermore , knowledge risk predictor poor treatment outcome , long-term pain prevent treat greatly limited . Here , currently unclear factor , patient related and/or treatment component , less effective different subgroup patient chronic pain . This discuss extensively national SQRP-network demand scientific literature . Knowledge enable MMR provider customize treatment accord patient profile order maximize treatment outcome relation cost . The overall aim research program prospectively evaluate multimodal rehabilitation ( MMR ) patient chronic pain condition , translational research approach . The long-term goal develop implement update knowledge Swedish MMR program . The follow two strategic aim target : 1 ) effectiveness MMR program , 2 ) prediction risk positive negative outcome , respectively . Methods Study design This research project carry longitudinal cohort-study design base data extract Swedish Quality Registry Pain Rehabilitation ( SQRP ; www.ucr.uu.se/nrs ) well Swedish Social Insurance Agency ( SSIA ) . Additionally , data collect help supplementary questionnaire cover information treatment process . This questionnaire validate early present project . SQRP-data two different patient cohort analyse . Firstly , data cover patient complete treatment 2012-13 one-year follow-up 2013-2014 use analyse effect MMR . Secondly , data cover 2015-16 use prediction study . As indicated , database augment data collect supplementary questionnaire . Sample sizes two cohort ( first second ) range around 4000 2000 , respectively . These estimate base historical registration statistic SQRP . Sample size large essential proper effect prediction analysis . They entail indeed high test-power analysis overall effect ; therefore , addition test statistical significance , effect size calculate order avoid type I error , i.e . avoid falsely claim effect exist support support p-values large sample . Included subject patient age 18 65 referral MMR clinic ( specialist clinic ) chronic musculoskeletal pain problem . Data SQRP allow longitudinal evaluation treatment effect , prediction analyse health economic evaluation link SSIA . SQRP registry mainly cover patient-reported questionnaire data intend health care research quality work healthcare provider offer MMR . SQRP connect Swedish Association Local Authorities Regions ( Sveriges Kommuner och Landsting ) part system national quality registry Sweden ( www.kvalitetsregister.se ) . Currently , 35 Swedish MMR specialist-treatment unit ( represent 90 % pain rehabilitation centre country ) associate registry continuously transmit patient data SQRP ( www.ucr.uu.se/nrs/index.php/om-registret ) . This mean nationwide data part Sweden include SQRP constitutes major strength database . Based data , annual report compile SQRP steer group co-worker describe compare performance associate MMR treatment unit overall scale . Since 2007 account available public ( http : //www.ucr.uu.se/nrs/index.php ) . Data establish questionnaire register SQRP measure health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) , consequence prolong pain problem level activity function ( Multidimensional Pain Inventory , MPI ) , perceive health ( EQ-5D ) , pain intensity ( numeric rating scale ) , anxiety depression ( The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , HAD ) . Furthermore , data socio-demographic detail , information employment sick leave status well pain duration future prospect collect . In addition patient-reported data , attend MMR practitioner complement registry patient 's diagnosis , information type pain expect form employment ( post-rehabilitation ) . As indicated , SQRP data link central database Swedish Social Insurance Agency ( SSIA ) . In database record keep everyone live Sweden period sickness absence exceed two week time . Thus , database provide objective measure work capacity . We therefore use central database SSIA identify period sickness absence patient study prior , rehabilitation . Additional empirical data Information patient 's treatment process register SQRP . We therefore measure detail treatment process supplementary questionnaire staff participate MMR unit request complete patient . This supplementary questionnaire develop validate scope project . It comprise question regard treatment process , information amount treatment schedule amount treatment attend ( hour ) , length total treatment time period , well structure component treatment . It common practice administer MMR form group training/education module . Information modules patient attend combination specific characteristic patient measure admission rehabilitation program treatment outcome offer possibility detail analysis . For example , possible evaluate component MMR serve certain patient group best . The evaluation experience workplace intervention conduct questionnaire semi-structured in-depth interview select MMR treatment unit . Questionnaires interview guideline purpose developed validate scope present project . Data analysis Quality life , pain intensity , function , activity level , well work-related sickness absence health economy ( direct indirect cost ) serve dependent outcome measure evaluation effect . The use single outcome measure rarely sufficient describe patient 's experience , symptom treatment outcome term understand potential effect . However , multiple outcome variable inter-correlated therefore reasonable apply multivariate analysis control dependent relationship . Therefore , multivariate repeat measure analysis use approach effect variables prospectively , logistic regression multiple approach apply analyse prediction model .</detailed_description>
