	<brief_summary>Long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) increase life span patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease low oxygen level . However , even oxygen therapy home , time time patient still low oxygen level especially walk harmful . The investigator design new system deliver oxygen overcome problem . The system measure oxygen saturation patient subsequently adjust flow oxygen meet pre-set oxygen saturation target . Hypothesis : investigator intelligent oxygen therapy system well reduce low level oxygen 6 minute walk usual ambulatory oxygen patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , disease progression lead hypoxic respiratory failure necessitate use long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) . However number study show despite LTOT home many patient COPD still experience episode intermittent hypoxia ( reduction oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % ) . These episode occur rest , sleep , talk , walk sleep . These episode intermittent hypoxia harmful lead development ischaemic heart disease , induce pulmonary hypertension affect brain function . In order reduce episode intermittent hypoxia , investigator design auto-titrating , closed-loop oxygen system automatically adjust flow oxygen match give oxygen saturation target . This allow individualisation optimisation oxygen therapy every patient . Mechanism action : A pulse oximeter attach ear finger patient . This send oxygen saturation read control centre ( locate mobile phone ) . The control centre pre-programmed maintain set oxygen saturation target . The control centre output signal flow meter regulate outflow oxygen . In study , investigator recruit patient COPD LTOT patient IPF LTOT ambulatory oxygen undergo three 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . The first air ( practice walk ) , second usual ambulatory oxygen third auto-titrating oxygen system . The order second third walk randomly select . The patient blind type oxygen receive second third walk . Hypothesis : investigator iO2t system well prevent treat oxygen desaturations occur 6MWT usual fix flow ambulatory oxygen therapy</detailed_description>
