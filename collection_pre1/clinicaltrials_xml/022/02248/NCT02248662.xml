	<detailed_description>With great use screen mammography , incidence pre-invasive breast carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) increase 560 % past 35 year . By year 2020 , 1 million woman live DCIS diagnosis . Despite large number woman affect , optimal treatment strategy DCIS know . DCIS spread lymph node sit body , leave untreated , progress invasive breast cancer . Mastectomy , removal breast , standard care treatment DCIS curative almost patient ; however , extreme surgery diagnosis may progress invasive breast cancer . Currently 70 % woman DCIS receive breast-conserving surgery , risk diagnose second cancer breast . Some woman DCIS undergo radiation therapy deliver breast breast-conserving surgery decrease risk another diagnosis affect breast . But woman undergoes radiation DCIS 2nd diagnosis breast , need mastectomy since radiation give due limit normal tissue tolerance . Therefore , radiation therapy may also reduce long-term likelihood breast conservation . The important outcome lifetime breast conservation without radiation study , result patient physician choose treatment without complete information expect treatment outcome . Across United States , use radiation therapy DCIS varies region country . Instead , choice add radiation vary accord value preference DCIS patient . To enable informed decision-making DCIS patient , seek provide individualize data outcome follow breast conserving-surgery without radiation therapy - term recurrence , disease-free overall survival , likelihood long-term breast conservation . To , study patient-specific risk factor new breast cancer DCIS likelihood breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy woman 2nd cancer diagnosis DCIS receive radiation upfront , use 4 large datasets . The result analysis combined model generate individually tailored prediction long-term likelihood breast conservation without radiation therapy DCIS . So patient physician access result model , design web-based decision aid present tradeoff compare expect treatment outcome without radiation therapy . This decision aid enable patient physician choose treatment consonant patient preference , improve quality decision-making quality life patient diagnose DCIS .</detailed_description>
