	<brief_title>Open-Label Safety , Tolerability , PK Study IV CXA-10 Emulsion Subjects Chronic Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label study , single-dose study CXA-10 subject CKI . At total 12 subject enrol two equal group accord baseline estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR : 15 - 39 40 - 59 mL/min/1.73m2 ) . All subject receive single dose infusion CXA-10 emulsion . Since first administration CXA-10 non-healthy volunteer population , conservative approach take ensure safety . Thus , first 2 subject group dose one dose level high safe dose level administer FIH study . If dose find safe specific subject population , remainder 4 subject group receive high safe dose FIH study ; otherwise , remainder receive initial dose . The dos administer study exceed high exposure achieve FIH study , dos may need adjust low level , base evaluation current pharmacokinetic data , ensure appropriate exposure level . Safety , PK PD assessment conduct approximately 18 day follow dose session . There follow-up visit approximately 1 week dosing .</detailed_description>
