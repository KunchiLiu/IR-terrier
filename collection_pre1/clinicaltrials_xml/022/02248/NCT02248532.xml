	<brief_summary>The goal REMEDIUM project develop personalized stem cell therapy patient chronic heart failure due dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) . The main focus project ( 1 ) repetitive administration cell therapy would allow long-lasting improvement heart function outcome patient population . In parallel , investigator aim ( 2 ) develop standardized patient-specific stem cell product could cryopreserved stored stem cell bank prolong time period , use therapeutic application clinically indicate . By use unique multimodality image platform , goal project also ( 3 ) define standardize clinical criterion would serve guideline evaluation effect stem cell therapy future clinical trial everyday clinical setting . Finally , improve clinical implementation cell therapy , investigator aim ( 4 ) develop stem cell delivery technique could use treat leave right ventricular failure could implement standardized fashion design widespread clinical use .</brief_summary>
