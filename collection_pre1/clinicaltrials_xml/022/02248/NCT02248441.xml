	<brief_title>Effect Remote Ischemic Conditioning Patients With Chronic Ischemic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) lead cause morbidity mortality throughout world , incidence prevalence increase patient survive acute coronary syndrome . The disease cause abnormality cardiac structure function lead insufficient delivery oxygen metabolize tissue . These patient often debilitate , require chronic medication , many receive expensive device therapy manage symptom . Consequently , lead increase economic health burden heart failure . CHF end-stage broad range underlie cardiovascular disease , frequently cause ischemic heart disease . Other contributory cause include hypertension , heart valve disease , arrhythmia cardiomyopathy , result myocardial tissue damage loss ventricular function . Activation neurohormonal inflammatory compensatory mechanism lead vicious circle adaptive metabolic remodel process , eventually result progressive decline cardiac function significant morbidity mortality . Identification specific underlie cardiac condition crucial therapeutic approach patient suffer CHF . While pharmacological treatment remain dominate , resynchronization therapy surgical resection non-contractile tissue also increasingly conduct . Despite fact activation inflammatory system greatly contribute remodel process initiation myocardial fibrosis hypertrophy , clinical study target inflammatory component discourage . Remote ischemic conditioning ( RIC ) brief non-lethal episode ischemia remote organ tissue ( e.g . limb ) novel therapeutic method achieve protection ischemia-reperfusion injury target organ , e.g . heart . In clinical setting , RIC often perform repeat episode limb ischemia achieve intermittent inflation blood pressure cuff place around upper arm . In clinical randomized trial , RIC show reduce amount myocardial injury improve long-term outcome patient admit STEMI primary percutaneous coronary intervention patient undergoing cardiac surgery elective coronary intervention . RIC low-cost , simple safe procedure easily conduct use standard blood pressure cuff , method increasingly use clinical trial . The mechanism behind RIC yet fully understood , cardioprotective effect believe caused neural humoral signal cascade well systemic anti-inflammatory effect result cytoprotective state . In addition , RIC show reduce thrombus formation . Since activation platelet coagulation system fundamental thrombus formation degradation , another possible mechanism describe effect RIC could result effect arterial thrombus formation . The vast majority experimental clinical study utilized RIC single-occasion treatment ( i.e . 3 4 bout short limb ischemia conduct ) . However , experimental study recently suggest repeated RIC treatment may infer beneficial effect . Repeated RIC application show improve endothelial function modify leukocyte adhesion healthy volunteer . In rat model myocardial infarction , RIC repeat daily 28 day infarction reduce adverse ventricular remodel improved survival . Consequently , two on-going clinical trial ( clinicaltrials.gov : DREAM study NCT01664611 CRIC-RCT study NCT01817114 ) investigate effect repeat RIC LVEF function patient reduce ventricular function acute coronary event . Another study investigate effect repeat RIC patient severe heart failure leave ventricular assist device ( IMPULSE study NCT02044471 ) . So far , effect RIC patient suffer stable chronic ischemic heart failure unknown . Furthermore , register study evaluate effect long-term RIC give additive treatment standard medical therapy patient chronic ischemic heart failure . Hypothesis • We hypothesize , combination anti-remodelling anti-inflammatory property together improve endothelial function induce repetitive RIC treatment translate improve leave ventricular function well physical performance subject CHF . Purpose - To determine whether RIC apply daily basis 4 week improve leave ventricular function assess cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) subject CHF . - To investigate whether RIC apply daily basis 4 week improve muscle strength , cardiopulmonary exercise capacity thrombocyte function , change blood biomarker level inflammation heart failure subject CHF . - To investigate whether above-mentioned measurement differ patient CHF match subject RIC apply daily basis 4 week . Perspectives The present study elucidate whether long-term RIC treatment induces beneficial effect subject without chronic ischemic heart failure term improve leave ventricular contractile function exercise capacity , whether long-term RIC treatment induces systemic anti-inflammatory effect subject . Moreover , find study uncover mechanism behind RIC thus potentially optimize future treatment patient suffer , risk , ischemic heart disease .</detailed_description>
