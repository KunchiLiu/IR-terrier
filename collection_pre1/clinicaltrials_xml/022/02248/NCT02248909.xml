	<brief_summary>This study observational multicenter descriptive study . The study conduct primary outpatient medical institution different city RF . Primary care doctor primary contact great part population RF include COPD patient invite investigator . This observational descriptive study conduct within routine practice outpatient institution . Since spirometry integral part current all-round clinical practice , sit spirometry test routinely use examination patient COPD risk factor monitor condition COPD patient take part study . Thus decision spirometry every study subject determine exist treatment approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study observational multicenter descriptive study . No hypothesis check study . 3000 patient COPD risk factor plan enrol study ( current smoker former smoker smoke history ≥10 pack/years age &gt; 40 year respiratory complaint ) 1450 patient previously diagnose COPD contact physician outpatient institution study ( 3 month ) currently remission . 100 patient COPD risk factor approximately 50 patient early diagnose COPD currently stable plan enrolled site . Physicians pulmonologists outpatient institution Russian Federation take part study 30 site 18 city ( total 31 % RF population live city ) . The observational descriptive study conduct within routine practice outpatient institution . Examining treatment patient perform accord rule routine practice . Patients enrol study visit outpatient institution medical care . The study imply special invitation COPD patient sit enrolled study . Therefore condition make study population reflect typical visitor primary care medical institution different RF ( Russian Federation ) region . Patients enrol study regardless reason appointment doctor . A reason appointment respiratory complaint well disease certificate conclusion . To enrol study subject must sign write Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) participate study use personal data confidentially .
