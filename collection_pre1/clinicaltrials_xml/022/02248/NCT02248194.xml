	<brief_summary>Abnormal uterine bleeding ( AUB ) alteration pattern volume menstrual blood ï¬‚ow heavy menstrual bleeding affect 30 % woman time reproductive year . Abnormal menstruation due condition pregnancy complication uterine fibroid adenomyosis , large proportion case , etiology unclear , condition generally refer dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( DUB ) . Treatment option DUB include symptomatic medical treatment surgery , traditionally hysterectomy . Hysteroscopically guide endometrial ablation method show effective safe alternative hysterectomy management DUB . These method require particular skill experience long learn curve perform effectively safely . Through past three decade DUB patient Assiut university hospital treat either electrosurgical ablation hysterectomy . When faced hysteroscopic challenge transcervical resection endometrium rollerball coagulation , use shift thermal balloon backup method . However , expensive uterine balloon could infrequently afford financial constrains limit health resource . Therefore , another method use backup hysteroscopic failure . It first try via insulate conventional double-ended uterine curette specially design tactile electrosurgical ablation ( TEA ) probe.The technique TEA largely similar dilatation curettage procedure principally practically . Hence , basic requirement performance general awareness electrosurgical principle adequate experience perform dilatation curettage . TEA do specially design tactile diathermy probe carry job electrosurgical ablation without hysteroscopy distension medium first experimental session clearly clarify reproducibility depth thermal damage safety tactile electrosurgical ablator . Thereafter , TEA successfully perform satisfactory short medium term outcomes ten case DUB active , relentless bleed attack . TEA do laparoscopic monitoring . The aim present work present TEA simple , inexpensive , novel backup approach treatment DUB .</brief_summary>
