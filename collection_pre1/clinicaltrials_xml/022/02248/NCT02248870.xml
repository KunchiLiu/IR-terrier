	<brief_summary>Prolongation analgesic effect femoral nerve block present 15 hour 24 hour patient hip fracture would major impact order provide well preoperative analgesia group . In trial concern nerve femoral nerve addition Dexamethasone local anesthetic double analgesic duration . No study investigate effect addition Dexamethasone femoral nerve block patient hip fracture . The aim study investigate patient hip fracture experience last preoperative analgesia time operation 20 hour femoral nerve block addition Dexamethasone compare nerve block do without Dexamethasone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Femoral Nerve Block With Bupivacaine Adjuvant Dexamethasone Patients With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hip fracture often old , multiple comorbidities suffer severe pain . Femoral nerve block mean preoperative analgesia patient proven effective multiple trial majority patient . Still issue remain investigated order optimize preoperative analgesia group . One issue reduce feasibility femoral nerve block relatively short analgesic duration nerve block compare often long time hospital admission actual operation . From literature experience mean analgesic duration femoral nerve block approximate 15 hour . Many study show prolonged analgesic duration different nerve block Dexamethasone add local anesthetic . Some study show 100 percent increase duration . To knowledge study publish regard prolongation analgesic effect femoral nerve block Dexamethasone , also none regard group patient hip fracture . The clinical impact femoral nerve block analgesic duration 20 hour compare present 15 hour would less patient wake ward night time pain terminate femoral nerve block . The purpose study investigate patient hip fracture experience last preoperative analgesic duration least 20 hour time operation femoral nerve block Bupivacaine adrenaline addition Dexamethasone compare nerve block do Bupivacaine adrenaline .</detailed_description>
