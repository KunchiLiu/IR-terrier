	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study achieve collection safety efficacy data patient undergoing leave gastric artery embolization morbid obesity United States . As secondary goal , pilot study seek obtain quality life data . This pilot study design achieve new indication device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Artery Embolization Trial Lessening Appetite Nonsurgically</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beadblock use intraarterially occlude case leave gastric artery branch . The left gastric artery supply fundus stomach , know hormone ghrelin ( one hormones responsible appetite ) produce . Ghrelin 28 amino acid hunger stimulate peptide hormone produce mainly P/D1 cell line fundus stomach epsilon cell pancreas . Ghrelin emerge first identify circulating hunger hormone . Ghrelin also know circulate orexigen , appetite enhance hormone . Left gastric artery embolization may minimally invasive alternative current surgical treatment gastric bypass reduction surgery . These treatment know serious complication include anastomotic leak , bowel obstruction , paralytic ileus , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , gastrointestinal bleeding , dump syndrome , anesthesia risk result morbidity mortality . Literature review gastric artery embolization Transarterial embolization common interventional procedure use treat variety medical condition . In image-guided procedure , embolic , obstructive , agent insert catheter place inside artery prevent blood flow artery specific area body . Types embolic agent include bead , coil , gel foam , well material device . Gastric artery embolization use since 1970 's treat life threaten gastric hemorrhage . This commonly accepted standard care life save thousand patient . It even deem effective enough use empirically set angiographically negative life threaten hemorrhage ( reflection safety margin ) . Recent animal study past several year porcine canine model show gastric artery embolization result suppression ghrelin level weight loss . Arepally , et al . ( 2008 ) first describe technique gastric artery embolization reduce weight gain . In controlled study , use sodium morrhuate within porcine model resultant lower ghrelin level significantly blunt weight gain ( otherwise rapidly grow young swine ) . Paxton , et al . ( SIR abstract 2012 , later publish 2013 2014 ) describe technique 40 micron microsphere particle embolization similar porcine model also result lowered ghrelin level reduce weight gain . Also note duodenal upregulation ghrelin . Bawudun et al . ( 2012 ) describe technique leave gastric embolization use mixture bleomycin lipiodol versus polyvinyl alcohol 500-700 micron particle create weight loss canine model without gastric ulceration . In addition , demonstrate significant reduction subcutaneous fat plasma ghrelin . Kipshidze , et al . ( 2013 ) perform first man study report annual meeting American College Cardiology show average 45lbs weight loss 6 month reduce ghrelin level 5 patient complication ( endoscopic follow-up ) small series use BeadBlock 300-500 micron particle . According personal correspondence author study weight loss sustain least 1 year complication 5 patient . He also note additional 7 patient treat without complication . A recent retrospective case control study present 2013 Radiological Society North American annual meeting find average 7.9 % decrease body weight ( 3 month ) 15 patient underwent leave gastric artery embolization life threaten hemorrhage compare 1.2 % ( P=0.001 ) age match control ( underwent embolization leave gastric artery upper gastrointestinal bleeding ) .</detailed_description>
