	<brief_summary>The Sonatherm device provide advanced imaging ( ultrasound guidance ) high intensity focus ultrasound target ablate tumor . It also require pierce tumor needle cryotherapy ( Cryo ) radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation . Cryo RF also high retreatment rate due find untreated tumor follow-up imaging . Thus , reason hypothesize Sonatherm 's real-time ultrasound image feedback could replace RF Cryo treatment small renal mass invasiveness full resection partial nephrectomy contraindicate due patient comorbidities .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Laparoscopic High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Probe Ablation Small Renal Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use treat resect model ablation follow partial nephrectomy . This allow ablation evaluate necrosis target accuracy . It also ensure cancer safety prior validation HIFU device . The applied heat HIFU ablation could improve hemostasis blood loss .</detailed_description>
