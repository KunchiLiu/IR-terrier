	<detailed_description>Celiac disease ( CD ) immune-based reaction dietary gluten ( storage protein wheat , barley , rye ) primarily affect small intestine genetically predispose patient resolve exclusion gluten diet . Although CD surely place among autoimmune disease , patient CD show circulate autoantibody ( anti-transglutaminase , anti-tTG ) suffer destruction specific tissue cell type ( enterocytes ) CD8+ T cell . Furthermore , autoimmune disease report association CD 20-30 % case . In last year , new clinical entity emerge , seem include patient consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name `` Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity '' ( 6 ) , , recent paper , investigator suggest term `` Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) , since , date , know component wheat really cause symptom . The doubt area NCWS regard also pathogenesis , despite paper evidence intestinal immunologic activation , others link NCWS dietary FODMAPs ( Fermentable Oligo-di Mono-saccharides , And Polyols ) load , thus exclude immunologic involvement NCWS . To explore presence autoimmunity NCWS , present study investigator evaluate : ) frequency autoimmune diseases b ) frequency serum anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA ) positivity newly diagnose NCWS CD patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose NCWS recently propose criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion negative serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) IgA IgG antibodies absence intestinal villous atrophy negative IgEmediated immuneallergy test wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) resolution IBS symptoms standard elimination diet , exclude wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , selfreported food ( ) causing symptom symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge . As previously describe study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge perform . Additional inclusion criterion : age &gt; 18 year followup duration longer six month initial diagnosis least two outpatient visit followup period . positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , also case normal villi/crypts ratio duodenal mucosa selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce , enter study `` organic '' gastrointestinal disorder nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder physical impairment limit physical activity menopause steroid sex steroid therapy , hormone replacement therapy ovariectomy .</criteria>
