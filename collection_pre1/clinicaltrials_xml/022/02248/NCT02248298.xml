	<brief_title>Efficacy AFL-assisted PDT With Short Incubation Time Actinic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) widely use treatment superficial skin cancer . It excellent cosmetic outcome , could consider first-line therapy Actinic keratosis ( AK ) . In PDT incubation time require photosensitizer convert PpIX . The recommended treatment regimen PDT require relatively long incubation time ALA ( 4 hour ) MAL ( 3 hour ) illumination . Theoretically , ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) pre-treatment may facilitate penetration distribution topically apply drug , since ablate laser hole extend dermis , thereby possibly act channel drug uptake . However , knowledge optimal photosensitizer incubation time AFL-PDT limit . The objective study compare efficacy , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcome , safety AFL-PDT 2 3hours incubation vs. conventional MAL-PDT patient facial scalp AK .</detailed_description>
