	<brief_title>Association Previously Verified Gene Polymorphisms With AMD Turkish Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) remain important cause severe visual impairment elderly people develop country . It one best-characterized complex trait disease . Multiple genetic environmental factor play role pathogenesis . A number different biological pathway relate gene polymorphism strongly implicate etiology . A lot chromosomal location study figure genetic risk factor responsible development AMD . Most genetic variant find related AMD least one study verify subsequent study . However recent year , single-nucleotide polymorphism relate complement system also chromosome 10q26 strongly elicit predispose individual susceptibility AMD . These polymorphism verify subsequent study . However , result different geographic region world represent discrepancy accord ethnic population . Aforementioned genetic test commercially introduce give patient risk progression advance stage AMD , rate risk give genetic result together environmental factor USA . Age relate macular degeneration consist dry wet form . Although wet form responsible severe vision loss due AMD , dry form progress wet form passage time . The risk AMD increase age get old cause severe central vision loss ; consequently reduce considerably quality life senile population . Available treatment AMD expensive economical burden . Early diagnosis disease favourable impact post-treatment prognosis . Although basis treatment primarily base preservation current visual acuity , possible obtain improvement visual acuity agent inhibit angiogenesis recent year . However , complete response treatment obtain approximately one fifth patient . Different response treatment obtain remain group . The reason difference treatment may due different morphological subgroup and/or diversity genetic variant wet AMD . . We moment know whether gen polymorphism relate AMD establish western population also relate AMD population whether relationship similar risk protective effect AMD . The gen variant mostly study relation AMD CFH ( rs1061170 rs1410996 ) , LOC387715/ARMS-2 ( A69S /rs10490924 ) , HTRA-1 ( rs11200638 ) , C3 ( R102G/ rs2230199 ) , C2 E318D ( rs9332739 ) , CFB R32Q ( rs641153 ) . A preliminary study publish recently , carry team single center small number patient show CFH LOC387715 gen polymorphism entertain risk late AMD suggest necessity perform forward study large population learn definite information population . On hand , entire eight genetic locus relate AMD study first time population . In introduced project study , relationship eight different gen polymorphism ( CFH rs1061170 rs1410996 , LOC387715 / ARMS2 gene rs10490924 , C2 gene rs9332739 , CFB gene rs641153 , CFI rs10033900 , HTRA-1 gene rs11200638 , C3 rs2230199 ) study 2800 patient high risk intermediate late stage AMD 2200 age-matched control subject . Blood sample brachial vein study subject collect 5 health center compose Bursa Retina Eye Center Hospitals Afyon Kocatepe University , Dokuz Eylul University , Konya University Uludag University within period 32 month . After collection venous sample , polymorphism genotyped `` real-time PCR '' `` pyrosequencing '' genotyping system genetic laboratory Afyon Kocatepe University Medical School . Within last 3 month project duration , complete genotyping sample , evaluation study data clinically statistically make , preparation final report realize . . As primary outcome , protective effect risk rate develop late AMD genetic polymorphism calculate statistical analysis follow genotyping . Sub-analyses do investigate relationship genetic polymorphism response treatment . Sub-analyses do determine possible difference genetic variant late dry wet AMD also among morphological subtypes wet AMD . Main study secondary sub-studies derive sub-analyses methodology submit different study publication . The anticipated result study may impact management follow-up patient AMD . Because AMD etiologically multi-factorial disease environmental controllable risk factor outside genotypic feature , may possible early diagnosis frequent follow-up addition recommend avoid modifiable risk factor patient early AMD genetically high risk development late AMD accord finding obtain study result . It also possible establish patient wet AMD resistant sensitive treatment accord genotyping . Whether perform genetic test patient candidate late AMD near future significant meaningful population establish . Our result evaluate together literature make substantial contribution well understanding pathogenesis AMD well early diagnosis well classification treatment choice .</detailed_description>
