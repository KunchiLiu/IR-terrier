	<brief_summary>Historically , ultrasound image lung parenchyma challenge high total ultrasound energy attenuation scatter air lung . However , recent technological advancement allow rapid assessment various pulmonary disease via use lung ultrasound . Furthermore , show clear reproducible Doppler signal record lung parenchyma mean pulse Doppler ultrasound system incorporate special signal-processing package . The LDS may contain information significant diagnostic physiological value regard pulmonary parenchyma vasculature , well cardio-vascular system general . In pilot clinical validation study patient acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) patient , LDS signal unique ADHF patient identify , superpose normal Lung Doppler Signals ( unpublished data ) . These high velocity `` disorganize '' variable signal synchronous cardiac cycle rather sometimes respiration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose Rationale The purpose study assess utility noninvasive assessment lung Doppler signal perform via transthoracic parametric Doppler . The study two major objective thus , divide two phase , continuum . Phase 1 : The objective evaluate LDS among patient present emergency department acute dyspnea , order determine diagnostic value non-invasive method distinguish cardiac pulmonary cause dyspnea . Phase 2 : In addition , patient admit hospital clinical diagnosis ADHF , would like characterize change daily lung Doppler signal surrogate biomarker intravascular volume status , assess clinical assessment . Study Design Methods : 1 . Overall study design Phase 1 : Prospective cohort study patient present Massachusetts General Hospital emergency department acute dyspnea . . In addition , MGH , pt admit cardiac floor ( Ellison 9 , 10 , 11 ) general medicine floor ( White 9 , 10 , 11 ) admit diagnosis heart failure , present acute dyspnea , approach enrollment within 24 hour hospital admission . All patient acute dyspnea undergo routine clinical assessment , laboratory testing , diagnostic imaging . In addition , patient also undergo transthoracic parametric Doppler ultrasound base assessment LDS . Patients treat usual , direction attend physician . Two independent cardiologist perform detailed chart review patient determine etiology acute dyspnea . They blind result LDS . In event discrepant finding , third cardiologist perform final detailed chart review adjudicate diagnosis . Additionally , radiologist employ MGH independent study may perform blind adjudication study participant ' chest x-ray ( CXR ) obtain Emergency Department day enrollment study Phase 2 : In addition , patient diagnose ADHF ( diagnose base criterion describe ) , undergo daily TPD assessment LDS characterize change LDS time , day discharge day 7 hospitalization , whichever come first . In addition initial inpatient scan , study staff try acquire final scan within 72 hour discharge patient diagnose ADHF , regardless day hospitalization . This cohort patient also undergo daily clinical assessment volume status , weight measurement , BNP assessment . In event repeat BNP NT-proBNP lab drawn within 72 hour discharge , study staff coordinate pathology laboratory ( Dr. Kent Lewandrowski ) perform assay research test use excess clinical specimen subject 's routine clinical blood draw available . Research subject charge cost BNP NT-Pro-BNP assay .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase 1 ( ED ) : Inclusion criterion : Age &gt; 18 year Acute onset dyspnea Phase 2 ( Inpatient ) : Age &gt; 18 year Acute onset dyspnea : define SOB rest minimal activity , onset within past 14 day PLUS The following criterion require classified heart failure ( event meet follow criterion ) : ) The patient exhibit document new worsening symptom due heart failure presentation , include least one following : ) Dyspnea ( dyspnea exertion , dyspnea rest , orthopnea ) ii ) Decreased exercise tolerance b ) The patient objective evidence new worsen heart failure , consist least two physical exam finding ( one physical exam find one diagnostic criterion ) include : ) Physical exam finding consider due heart failure , include new worsen : ( 1 ) Peripheral edema ( 2 ) Increasing abdominal distention ascites ( absence primary hepatic disease ) ( 3 ) Increased jugular venous pressure and/or hepatojugular reflux ( 4 ) Rapid weight gain thought relate fluid overload ii ) Diagnostic finding consider due heart failure , include new worsen : 1 . Increased Btype natriuretic peptide/ NTproBNP concentration consistent decompensation heart failure Note : In patient chronically elevate natriuretic peptide , significant increase note baseline . 2 . Radiological evidence pulmonary congestion Phase 1 ( ED ) : Pregnant woman Inability consent Phase 2 ( Inpatient ) : Pregnant woman Pneumonia currently , within past 30 day Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema ( e.g . ARDS ) Interstitial lung disease Inability consent</criteria>
