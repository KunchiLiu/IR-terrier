	<brief_summary>The subject type lymph gland disease call Hodgkin Disease ( HD ) non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) , T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus ( CAEBV ) come back , risk come back , go away treatment , include best treatment know diseases . This research study use special immune system cell call LMP , BARF-1 EBNA1- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( MABEL CTLs ) . Some patient Lymphoma , T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease , CAEBV show sign virus call Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) cause mononucleosis glandular fever ( `` mono '' `` kiss disease '' ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell half patient HD NHL , suggest may play role cause Lymphoma . The cancer cell ( lymphoma ) immune system cell ( CAEBV ) infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . We want see special white blood cell ( MABEL CTLs ) train kill EBV infect cell survive blood affect tumor . In previous study , EBV CTLs generate blood patient , often difficult patient recently receive chemotherapy . Also , take 1-2 month make cell , practical patient need treatment urgently . To address issue , T cell current study make laboratory simpler , fast , safe way . The T cell make still see LMP protein also two EBV protein call EBNA-1 BARF . These cell call MABEL CTLs . In order ensure cell available use patient urgent clinical need , generate MABEL CTLs blood healthy donor create bank cell , freeze ready use . We previously successfully use frozen T cell healthy donor treat EBV lymphoma virus infection improve production method make faster . In study , want find use bank MABEL CTLs treat HD NHL , T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus ( CAEBV ) . We search bank find MABEL CTL line partial match subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A healthy donor give blood make LMP/BARF1/EBNA-1 MABEL CTLs lab . We make cell first grow special type cell call activate T cell stimulate T cell . We add specially produce mixture protein include LMP , EBNA1 BARF proteins . These used stimulate T cell . As T cell grow , add healthy donor cell express protein stimulate . We also add cell call K562 new gene put inside express protein stimulate immune system encourage T cell grow . K562 cell cancer cell treat radiation grow . This stimulation train MABEL CTLs kill cell EBV proteins surface . These cell grow frozen . For subject 's treatment , MABEL CTLs thaw infused subject 2-10 minute . Initially , two dos MABEL CTLs give two week apart . Subjects may eligible receive additional dos MABEL CTLs 6 time . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . Medical test treatment : Before treat , subject receive series standard medical test : Physical exam Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function Measurements tumor routine image study . We use image study use follow tumor : Computer Tomogram ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET/CT ) Pregnancy test female able child Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , patient 's level circulating T cell relatively high , s/he may require treatment cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) fludarabine s/he receives MABEL CTLs . Medical test treatment : Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function Imaging study 8 week 1st CTL infusion . If subject receive additional dos also image study 1 3 month final dose . Subjects either see clinic contact research staff yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
