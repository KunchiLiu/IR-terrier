	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tear one common cause shoulder pain . Evidence-based guidance optimal diagnostic treatment strategy rotator cuff tear lack . Our propose study aim fill gap identify prognostic factor predict good outcome rotator cuff tear , base operative non-operative treatment . The investigator also compare outcomes operative non-operative treatment rotator cuff tear report best way diagnose rotator cuff tear .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Operative Versus Non-Operative Treatments Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tear account one quarter million surgery annually . They lead cause shoulder pain disability . Patients rotator cuff tear present shoulder pain and/or limitation range motion . Fourteen special physical exam test describe diagnosis rotator cuff tear . Prior literature describe sensitivity specificity test diagnose cuff tear limit retrospective design , small sample size , sample restrict patient undergo surgery , failure differentiate partial full thickness tear . As result , little evidence help clinician interpret diagnostic value clinical exam . Consequently , clinician rely heavily magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diagnose cuff tear , add considerable expense diagnostic process . The treatment option rotator cuff tear operative non-operative . There currently little consensus indication time rotator cuff surgery non-operative treatment . Furthermore , lack evidence-based guidance factor associate outcomes operative versus non-operative treatment cuff tear . We enrol patient prospective cohort study ass comparative-effectiveness operative versus non-operative treatment rotator cuff tear understand prognostic factor well outcomes surgery non-operative treatment .</detailed_description>
