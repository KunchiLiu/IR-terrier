	<brief_title>Regorafenib Reducing Recurrence Patients With Non-metastatic Rectal Cancer Who Have Completed Curative-Intent Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 3-year disease free survival patient T3 , T4 node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma receive regorafenib maintenance therapy follow completion curative-intent standard treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine cumulative incidence local recurrence , distant recurrence overall survival 3 year . II . To explore biomarkers associate anti-cancer effect regorafenib maintenance therapy curatively treat rectal cancer patient analyze tumor blood sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive regorafenib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 4 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
