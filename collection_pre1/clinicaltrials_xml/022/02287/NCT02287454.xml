	<brief_summary>The study design parallel-group randomized trial equal randomization . Recruitment enrollment conduct January 2013 March 2013 . At base-line , cognitive data collect . Afterwards , participant randomly allocate either REHACOP group Control group . During 3 month intervention REHACOP program take place follow-up patient re-evaluated evaluate change cognitive measure . Post-treatment assessment ( finish July 2013 ) perform within first week complete intervention . Objective : To examine efficacy integrative cognitive training program ( REHACOP ) improve cognition patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assessment protocol : Patients underwent extensive neuropsychological battery include test attention , work memory , process speed , verbal memory ( learn recall ) , verbal fluency executive functioning . Sustained attention measure use Brief Test Attention . For work memory , Backward Digits subtest Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale III use . Processing speed assess Symbol Digit Modalities Test , three six letter version Salthouse Perceptual Comparison Test Trail Making Test A. Verbal memory determine base Hopkins Verbal Learning Test , learn long-term recall performance . For verbal fluency , Category ( animal supermarket ) Letter ( P ) Word Fluency Test Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment utilized . Executive function calculate word-color interference score Stroop Word-Color Test . Additionally , several test scale administer . The Expanded Disability Status Scale use rating degree neurologic impairment . Premorbid IQ test The Accentuation Reading Test . Cognitive reserve estimate Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire . The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale include assess patientsÂ´ depressive symptom . The Fatigue Severity Scale mental fatigue Visual Analogue Scale include evaluate physical mental fatigue , respectively . Description intervention : REHACOP structured program use paper-pencil task base principle restoration , compensation optimization gradually increase level cognitive effort demand . REHACOP train different cognitive domain , attention , memory , process speed , language , executive function social cognition . Additionally , program include one unit related functional outcome : activity daily live . REHACOP include 300 different task hierarchically organize least three level difficulty subtypes ability . Several task time , process speed train throughout various module . Once basic cognitive strategy train well acquire , therapist transition program next level . The program format allow either individual group session ( 5 8 patient per group ) , although purpose study , group session choose . In study , two psychologist conduct REHACOP group attend 60-minute-long session 3 day per week Multiple Sclerosis Association Biscay ( ADEMBI ) ( four group ) . Specifically , REHACOP group remediation MS patient consist : Attention unit ( 4 week ) training sustain , selective , alternant divide attention ; Memory unit ( 3 week ) focus visual verbal learning , recall recognize memory , well work memory ; Language unit ( 3 week ) include verbal fluency , grammar , syntax , vocabulary , verbal comprehension , abstract language ; Executive function unit ( 2 week ) training development , plan attainment objective ; Social cognition unit ( 1 week ) exercise theory mind , social reason moral dilemma .</detailed_description>
