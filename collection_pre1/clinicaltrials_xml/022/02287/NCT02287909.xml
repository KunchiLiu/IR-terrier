	<brief_title>Switching From Ticagrelor Clopidogrel Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommended antiplatelet treatment regimen patient affect acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) consist combination aspirin P2Y12 receptor inhibitor . Currently , three P2Y12 receptor inhibitor available clinical use ( clopidogrel , prasugrel , ticagrelor ) . Among , clopidogrel remain widely use . However , recent study show broad variability platelet-inhibitory response induce clopidogrel , turn associate bad outcome . More potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) develop associate less response variability clopidogrel well clinical outcome . Ticagrelor use increase significantly expand Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) indication compare prasugrel . However , despite evidence sustain efficacy safety , many physician limit treatment duration ticagrelor early phase follow ACS ( early week month , rather one-year ) mostly due cost issue concern increase bleeding . Therefore , common clinical practice switch patient maintenance dosing ( MD ) ticagrelor treatment clopidogrel . However , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect switch ticagrelor clopidogrel remain unknown . In addition , unknown whether switch ticagrelor clopidogrel occur without load dose ( LD ) . Therefore , aim investigation evaluate PD effect switch ticagrelor clopidogrel without LD . The present study prospective , randomize , open-label design , patient treat 4 different strategy assess PD profile switch . This study provide important insight PD effect switch ticagrelor clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
