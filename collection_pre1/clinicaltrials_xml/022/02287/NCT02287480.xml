	<brief_summary>The hemorrhagic fever result Ebola infection frequently fatal ; current Ebola outbreak , still ascendant phase , mortality rate 50 % . There proven therapy prevention available time . The vaccine candidate VSV-ZEBOV ( BPSC1001 ) show promising safety efficacy prevent Ebola Zaire infection non-human primate ( NHP ) . Before assessed large Phase IIb/3 trial affect area , safety data phase 1 first-in-human trial need . To accelerate process , World Health Organization ( WHO ) constitute consortium Clinical Research Centers Switzerland , Germany , Africa use similar protocol collectively include roughly 250 volunteer , sample size require identify 2-fold difference anti-ZEBOV IgG antibody titer follow immunization 2 different dos BPSC1001 . The joint primary objective single-center , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled phase 1 dose-finding study assess safety tolerability VSV-ZEBOV vaccine administer healthy volunteer low high vaccine dose define whether seroresponses differ significantly follow immunization lower high vaccine dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center , double-blind , randomize placebo-controlled phase 1 dose-finding study two randomization scheme . Volunteers could later expose Ebolavirus work epidemic area ( `` deployable subject '' ) randomize receive one two vaccine dos . Non-deployable volunteer , identify risk Ebola exposure near term , allocate one three group receive low high vaccine dose , placebo . A single immunization perform . All subject observe clinical trial unit ( CTU ) 1.5 hour vaccine/placebo injection . Subjects complete post-injection diary 7 day injection , well post-injection follow-up visit ( see ) . On-site visit CTU occur day -90 -1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 84 , 168 . Some subject positive serologic response 24 week may request return immune durability test 12 month . One interim analyse undertaken guide decision 1 ) potential use vaccine Ph2/3 trial affect country 2 ) potential modification trial ( ) amendment evaluate high dose , immunogenicity poor , low dose dosage level select safe reasonably well tolerate .</detailed_description>
