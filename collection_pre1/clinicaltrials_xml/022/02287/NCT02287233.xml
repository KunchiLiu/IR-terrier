	<brief_summary>This study consist three portion : The first portion- Phase 1 , dose-escalation portion , evaluate safety pharmacokinetic profile venetoclax combination low-dose cytarabine ( LDC ) , define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , generate data support recommend Phase 2 dose ( RPTD ) treatment-naïve subject Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) . Second portion , initial Phase 2 evaluate RPTD sufficient efficacy acceptable toxicity warrant development combination therapy . Subsequently , Phase 2 Cohort C , evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) subject allow additional supportive medication ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) medically indicate .</brief_summary>
