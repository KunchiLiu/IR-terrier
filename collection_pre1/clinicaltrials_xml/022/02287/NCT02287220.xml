	<brief_summary>The purpose study test accuracy web cam-based biomedical device develop UVA ( FDA-approved ) design measure heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation without require patient contact . One potential application device would field infant monitoring allow parent ( physician ) monitor vital sign infant continuously . The investigator therefore propose record heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation 100 infant ( defined child age 12 month less ) receive continuous oxygen , heart rate , respiratory rate monitoring traditional vital sign monitor . The relationship `` non-contact '' `` gold standard '' ( GE monitoring equipment ) heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation analyze use regression limit agreement analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While multiple investigator attempt develop non-contact pulse oximeter , none device achieve accuracy sufficient clinical use , device approve Food Drug Administration , currently device market United States . While device typically able measure heart respiratory rate accuracy , v accurate calculation oxygen saturation arterial pulse ( SpO2 ) use `` non-contact '' reflectance oximetry probe complicate interference ambient light , patient temperature change , well inherent limitation sense device currently utilize . Poh et al somewhat successful calculate heart rate video record use independent component analysis . However , Poh 's method calculate instantaneous rate require facial recognition component track facial orientation image , capable measure respiratory rate , relies primarily analysis reflect green light ( used calculation oxygen saturation ) . Our work involve modify commercial shelf ( COTS ) 3-channel ( red , green , blue ) CCD ( charge couple device ) CMOS ( complementary metal oxide semiconductor ) camera form web cam detect near infrared infrared spectrum radiation apply algorithm base fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) individual red pixel intensity detect motion color change . Because algorithm analyzes first derivative red pixel intensity , face-tracking component unnecessary , able calculate heart rate respiratory rate real time .</detailed_description>
