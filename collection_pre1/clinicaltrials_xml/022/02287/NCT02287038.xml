	<detailed_description>PTSD debilitate disorder common among Veterans return Iraq Afghanistan ( OIF/OEF ) due high risk exposure combat trauma .

The outcome propose research significant , provide knowledge base help determine risk develop problem treatment engagement among PTSD patient , thereby allow development early intervention strategy drop-out . More importantly , new knowledge may lead discover new target novel effective treatment PTSD . This novel clinical trial may immediate benefit Veterans enhance cognitive function , reduce ADHD symptom relate disability improve quality life Veterans comorbid ADHD/PTSD .</detailed_description>
