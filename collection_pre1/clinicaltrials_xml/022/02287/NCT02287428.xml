	<brief_summary>This research study study new type vaccine possible treatment patient MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma . This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine use patient , include people glioblastoma . The purpose study determine possible make administer safely vaccine glioblastoma use information gain specific characteristic participant tumor . It known glioblastomas mutation ( change genetic material ) specific individual patient 's tumor . These mutation cause tumor cell produce protein appear different body 's cell . It possible protein use vaccine may induce strong immune response , may help body fight tumor cell could cause glioblastoma come back future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine With Radiotherapy Patients With MGMT Unmethylated , Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know glioblastomas mutation specific individual patient 's tumor . These mutation cause tumor cell produce protein appear different body 's cell . It possible protein use vaccine may induce strong immune response , may help body fight tumor cell could cause glioblastoma recur . Methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) DNA repair protein increase cancer , include glioblastoma . MGMT work repair DNA cancer cell damage treatment . If tumor find `` unmethylated '' , mean MGMT present tumor one `` methylated '' . Methylation MGMT believe make tumor cell responsive drug like temozolomide . Studies show temozolomide provide small improvement outcome many patient whose glioblastoma MGMT-unmethylated . This study patient MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma . Patients glioblastoma usually receive six week radiation daily chemotherapy call temozolomide surgery , follow six twelve month additional temozolomide . In study , participant take temozolomide , tumor MGMT-unmethylated , study show temozolomide provide small improvement outcome many patient whose glioblastoma MGMT-unmethylated . Instead , trial , participant receive Personalized NeoAntigen Vaccine complete six week radiation : - Therapy On This Study : - Surgery - Followed six week radiation therapy - Followed series vaccine administration ( ~ 7 month ) The study examine safety vaccine give several different time point examine participant blood cell sign vaccine induce immune response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>NOTE : Eligibility confirm participant register 2 separate , serial occasion trial : 1 . ) Initial Study Screening : Shortly initial resection , newly diagnose patient identify screen . Once overall trial eligibility confirm participant register study , creation participant 's vaccine initiate . 2 . ) Secondary Screening : As participant 's 1st study vaccine dose may administer 1017 week initial study registration , secondary `` screen '' conduct participant complete RT his/her vaccine prepare , ensure s/he meet criteria receive study treatment . If confirm eligible next phase study ( eligible treat ) , participant proceed receive vaccine study . I . A . Study Eligibility Criteria Overall Study Participation ( Initial Registration ) Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study ( labs/tests/assessments within 14 day prior initial study registration unless otherwise specify ) Participant willing able give write informed consent Pathologically confirm WHO grade IV glioblastoma variant ( gliosarcoma , glioblastoma oligodendroglial feature , giant cell glioblastoma ) adequate tumor material genomic sequencing confirm study pathologist Keith Ligon , MD , PhD designate .
