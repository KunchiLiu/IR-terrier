By 2020 , proportion increase one-third ( Meyer , 2008 ) . In addition , baby boomer retire next year . In canton Glarus , 26 % old 65 year 2030 , compare 18 % today . The use health service consequential high cost health system rise dramatically ( Cruz et al. , 2014 ) . It believe approximately 2 billion Swiss Francs could save 2030 mean health promotion disease prevention program age group ( Stuck et al. , 2009 ) .

For mentioned reason exist LINTHPRAXEN Medical Center expand facility service form prevention center . One part expansion create occupational therapy-led health promotion program . The program base essential component already exist program `` Tatkraft - Gesund im Alter durch Betätigung '' ( Ferber et al. , 2012 ) `` Lifestyle Matters '' ( Mountain et al. , 2008 ) `` Life-Redesign-Prgram '' ( Jackson et al. , 1998 , Hay et al. , 2002 , Clark et al. , 2012 ) .
