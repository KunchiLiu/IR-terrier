Subject receive prophylactic treatment migraine may include . 5 . If female , childbearing potential ( defined premenarchal ) childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen negative urine pregnancy test Study Day 1 , Screening visit Day 1 day , must use medically acceptable method birth control list agrees continue use throughout study:1 ) hormonal method ( e.g. , oral , implantable , injectable , transdermal contraceptive minimum 1 full menstrual cycle study drug administration ) , 2 ) Total abstinence sexual intercourse since last menses study drug administration , 3 ) intrauterine device , 4 ) doublebarrier method ( e.g. , condom , sponge , diaphragm , vaginal ring spermicidal jelly cream ) . 6 . Subject 's legally authorize representative ( e.g. , parent , guardian ) must voluntarily sign date inform consent form ( ICF ) approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , subject must sign assent ( appropriate ) , commencement study assessment . 7 . Subject 's legally authorize representative ( e.g. , parent , guardian ) subject ( appropriate ) , able read understand study procedures requirement adhere protocol requirement procedure . 1 . Subject known history allergic reaction , hypersensitivity , clinically significant intolerance diclofenac , aspirin , nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ; history NSAID induce bronchospasm ( subject triad asthma , nasal polyp , chronic rhinitis great risk bronchospasm consider carefully ) ; hypersensitivity , allergy , significant reaction nonactive ingredient study medication . 2 . Subject pregnant lactating consider risk pregnancy . 3 . Subject inconsistent dose regimen prophylactic treatment migraine . 4 . Subject headache symptom likely due , aggravated , traumatic injury head neck region , whiplash , within last six month ; 5 . Subject suspect secondary headache . 6 . Subject significant abnormal finding neurological exam screening . 7 . Subject history GI event ( e.g. , perforation , obstruction , bleed ) Screening , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study participation . 8 . Subject receive medication , opinion investigator , may cause clinically significant condition use concomitantly diclofenac ( e.g. , aspirin , anticoagulant , ACE inhibitor , methotrexate , cyclosporine , furosemide , lithium ) . 9 . Subject receive medication know strongly inhibit and/or induce cytochrome P450 2C9 might unpredictably affect pharmacokinetics diclofenac ( e.g. , fluconazole , amiodarone , oxandrolone , sulfipyrazone inhibitor rifampin inducer ) . 10 . Subject condition laboratory abnormality would , opinion investigator , contraindicate study participation . 11 . Subject impaired liver function ( e.g. , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ≥ 3 time upper limit normal [ ULN ] bilirubin ≥ 3 time ULN ) , know active hepatic disease ( e.g. , hepatitis ) , evidence clinically significant liver disease condition affect liver may suggest potential increased susceptibility hepatic toxicity oral diclofenac exposure . 12 . Subject history renal disease , opinion investigator , would contraindicate study participation ; subject significantly impaired renal function evidence estimate GFR ≤60 ml/min/1.73m2 . 13 . Subject consider investigator , reason ( include , limited risk describe precaution , warning , contraindication Prescribing Information Cambia ) , unsuitable candidate receive study medication . 14 . Subject history laboratory test result obtain within 6 month Screening visit show presence HIV , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , active hepatitis A immunoglobulin M. 15 . Subject currently receive medication contraindicate use concomitantly diclofenac ( refer product ' professional labeling ) subject undergone washout period least 56 halflives PK PD , whichever longer , medication . 16 . Subject know suspected history alcohol use drug/ substance abuse misuse within 2 year Screening ; evidence tolerance physical dependence study medication administration . 17 . Subject documented history medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's ability absorb , metabolize , excrete diclofenac , include ( limited ) intractable nausea and/or vomit and/or severe GI narrowing ( pathologic iatrogenic ) . 18 . Subject receive investigational product device within 30 day Screening , schedule receive investigational device another investigational drug ( Cambia ) course study . 19 .
