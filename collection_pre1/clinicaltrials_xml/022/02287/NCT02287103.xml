	<brief_summary>Background : Skipping breakfast and/or overeat evening , associate type 2 diabetic ( T2D ) individual , high BMI , visceral adiposity , hyperlipidemia , increase overall postprandial glycemia ( PPHG ) high HbA1c . The absence breakfast also associate increase plasma free fatty acid ( FFA ) along morning lunch . High plasma FFA turn trigger factor insulin resistance , inhibit insulin mediate glucose uptake obese T2D subject The investigator therefore hypothesize compare eat breakfast prolong overnight fasting cause breakfast omission result increase postprandial glycemic response subsequent isocaloric lunch dinner T2D individual . Objectives : With aim study T2D patient randomize crossover design consume two separate day , either 3 standard isocaloric meal : Yes Breakfast condition ( YesB ) omit breakfast : breakfast condition ( NoB ) consume lunch dinner caloric content . Methods Study Design : The YesB intervention consist three identical meal coat 700 Kcal : breakfast 8:00 , lunch 13:00 dinner 19:00 . The NoB intervention breakfast omit subject continue fast lunch . Then participants consume identical 700 kcal Lunch 13:00 700 Kcal dinner 19:00 . The investigator assess plasma glucose , insulin , C-peptide , GLP-1 FFA blood sample collect every 30 min 180 min breakfast , lunch dinner time point blood sample collect 8:00 breakfast omit . Expected result : The investigator expect compare NoB condition , YesB condition postprandial response lunch dinner reduce glucose FFA , plasma insulin , C-peptide GLP-1 postprandial response lunch dinner enhance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Studies analyze postprandial glycemic response show glucose tolerance display clear diurnal variation progressive decline carbohydrate tolerance toward even hour prolong higher postprandial glycemic response even morning . Meal timing pattern , hand , exert strong entrain influence clock gene regulation hormone enzymes i.e . insulin , GLP-1 , involve glucose metabolism postprandial glycemia disrupt diurnal variation postprandial glycemia ( PPG ) . It suggest extent post-prandial rise plasma glucose depend upon quantity nature food ingest , clock gene regulate circadian hormonal rhythm , also depend upon metabolic state immediately prior eating . Indeed , meal schedule non-aligned clock gene circadian rhythm , skip breakfast and/or overeat evening , associate , T2D individual , high BMI , visceral adiposity , hyperlipidemia , high HbA1c increase PPG despite caloric intake . The absence breakfast associate obese T2D subject increase plasma level free fatty acid ( FFA ) along morning lunch , Chronic acute increase FFA plasma level , report trigger factor insulin resistance , inhibition insulin mediate stimulate glucose uptake and/or phosphorylation develop 3-4 hour raise plasma FFA inhibition glycogen synthase , rate limit enzyme glycogen synthesis , develop 4-6 hour rise FFA . However effect eat v skip breakfast postprandial glucose response identical lunch dinner explore . It therefore important explore influence eat versus skip breakfast postprandial glucose , lunch dinner T2D individual . Concomitantly investigator assess lunch dinner plasma insulin , GLP-1 FFA response lunch dinner T2D individual . Expected result : The investigator expect compare skip breakfast condition , eat breakfast condition reduce postprandial plasma glucose FFA response lunch dinner , plasma insulin , C-peptide GLP-1 lunch dinner enhance Relevance study : If hypothesis confirm may may practical benefit people Type 2 diabetes , condition reduction PPHG lunch dinner may result improved HbA1c might also preventive risk CVD Objectives : With aim study T2D patient randomize crossover design consume two separate day , either 3 standard isocaloric meal : Yes Breakfast condition ( YesB ) omit breakfast : breakfast condition ( NoB ) consume lunch dinner caloric content . Methods Study Design : The YesB intervention consist three identical meal coat 700 Kcal : breakfast 8:00 , lunch 13:00 dinner 19:00 . The NoB intervention breakfast omit subject continue fast lunch . Then participants consume identical 700 kcal Lunch 13:00 700 Kcal dinner 19:00 . The investigator assess plasma glucose , insulin , C-peptide , GLP-1 FFA blood sample collect every 30 min 180 min breakfast , lunch dinner time point blood sample collect 8:00 breakfast omit .</detailed_description>
