	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well positron emission tomography ( PET ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) work compare PET/computed tomography ( CT ) diagnose young patient cancer . PET/MRI PET/CT procedures combine picture PET scan MRI scan CT scan . The PET MRI scan PET CT scan do time machine . The combined scan give detailed picture area inside body either scan give . It yet know whether PET/MRI work well PET/CT diagnose young patient cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine diagnostic accuracy PET/MRI compare standard reference PET/CT lesion detection lesion characterization . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain quantitative measurement various body region standardize uptake value ( SUV ) normal tissue focus pathologic tracer uptake PET/MRI pediatric patient oncologic disease use various magnetic resonance attenuation correction ( MRAC ) method compare respective SUV base CT attenuation correction . II . Assess potential radiation dose reduction PET/MRI eliminate CT radiation dose . III . Assess time effort workflow improvement PET/MRI compare sequential PET/CT plus MRI . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT follow PET/MRI .</detailed_description>
