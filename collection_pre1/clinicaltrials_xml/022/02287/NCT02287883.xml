	<brief_title>Impact Patient Activation Engagement Patient-Centered Outcomes Care ACOs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Engaged patient refer `` â€¦the blockbuster drug 21st century '' . Under Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , Accountable Care Organizations ( ACOs ) require engage patient . The specific question address : Do patient receive care ACO practice highly develop patient activation engagement ( PA &amp; E ) activity achieve well patient report health outcome , report well experience care , well select clinical measure ( blood pressure , hemoglobin level , LDL-C ) compare patient receive care ACO practice less developed PA &amp; E initiative ? We plan capitalize natural occur variation degree implement PA &amp; E activity . OBJECTIVES 1 ) To collect information PA &amp; E activity 16 practice two ACOs baseline three year - include initiative focus disease prevention health promotion , care team-patient communication , share decision-making , self-management support , advance serious illness care , patient involvement care redesign experience ; 2 ) ass difference patient-reported outcome care , patient experience , select clinical measure patient expose highly develop PA &amp; E initiatives versus receive care practice minimal PA &amp; E activity ; 3 ) examine practice-level variation PA &amp; E implementation process include culture , leadership , teamwork , relational coordination . METHODS We take advantage naturally occur variation implementation PA &amp; E activity 16 practice two ACOs treat patient diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . A random sample chronically-ill patient two ACOs sample complete patient-reported outcome instrument include select Patient-Reported Outcomes ( PROMIS ) measure patient experience measure early late stage project . They also complete patient activation measure ( PAM ) . We examine change time outcome variable note . We also survey ACO/ practice stakeholder regard organizational culture , leadership , team effectiveness , relational coordination use previously validate instrument supplement site visit . Multilevel analyse examine PA &amp; E effect practice-level heterogeneity within ACOs , control patient characteristic . PATIENT OUTCOMES The propose project 's explicit focus examine PA &amp; E activity ACO practice highly develop PA &amp; E activity comparison little linking outcome measure note great interest patient , Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) , health care policy practitioner community . The finding help guide PCORI 's future research agenda area provide involve knowledge advance patient-centered care .</detailed_description>
