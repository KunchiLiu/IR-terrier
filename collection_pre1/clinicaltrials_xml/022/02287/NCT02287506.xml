	<brief_summary>There three main form diabetes : Type 1 diabetes , Type 2 diabetes genetic diabetes . The treatment different different cause . People Type 1 diabetes stop make insulin , need insulin injection instead , whereas people Type 2 diabetes keep make insulin may work well , need watch eat , may also need tablet eventually insulin injection . Genetic form diabetes specific treatment accord subgroup . It easy doctor able say definite kind diabetes person , particularly young adult , distinction type less clear . Because , sometimes ( 10 % case ) people give wrong diagnosis . This huge impact mean could wrong treatment start , control blood sugar properly , lead increase problem health poor quality life . We think way improve situation . We develop tool call `` Optimised Diagnostic Strategy '' ( ODS ) . This combine person 's clinical feature ( age weight ) , blood test look change body 's immune ( defence ) system , blood test look specific change genetic code , help accurately diagnose kind diabetes person . We need test ODS see well get right diagnosis treatment start compare routine clinical practice moment . This kind project call Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) would involve patient General Practitioner ( GP ) surgery United Kingdom ( UK ) . The project would expensive involves lot work many people get set keep run . Before need `` pilot '' see big study would possible practical . This pilot project do locally Exeter test part need large scale RCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>StartRIGHT : Right Diabetes Diagnosis Treatment ( Pilot Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes stratify recognised subtypes major implication patient ' treatment . The treatment Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) Maturity-onset diabetes young ( MODY ) markedly different base clear difference underlie pathophysiology . The difficult part stratification correctly diagnose subtype especially young adult . The clear differentiation T1D slim young , T2D obese old , long hold rapid increase obesity population : T1D patient may obese T2D patient may diagnose young . 90 % MODY patient misdiagnosed T1D T2D diagnosis MODY rarely consider . This result 7-15 % young adult diabetes wrongly classify incorrectly treat . Initial clinical diagnosis systematic make rarely change . Misdiagnosis T2D MODY T1D result unnecessary initial insulin treatment lead high drug/monitoring cost , side effect ( weight gain , hypo ) , patient inconvenience/dissatisfaction . Misdiagnosis T1D T2D , MODY ( initial treatment diet/tablets ) , result poor glycaemic control , frequent contact increase treatment , inappropriate insulin regime risk life threaten ketoacidosis . We develop optimize diagnostic strategy ( ODS ) base integrate Clinical information ( validated clinical probability model ) , Biomarkers ( GAD , Islet antigen-2 ( IA2 ) ZnT8 autoantibody ) Genetic test MODY . This potential determine subtype diabetes young adult lead improved treatment care . Prior undertake comprehensive RCT test ODS standard care , must first undertake pilot study assess feasibility project . Objectives : To assess feasibility recruitment retention propose large scale RCT , optimize recruitment retention strategy , develop assess protocol procedure , test delivery ODS , assess impact ODS obtain pilot data inform sample size calculation propose RCT Potential participant identify routine clinical care , clinician inform patient project general term seek permission contact detail pass research team . A range referral strategy assess potential participant appear meet entry criterion invite participate . Referral strategy assess include : referral research team GP/ Practice Nurse/diabetes specialist nurse , regular GP practice database search , via pathology lab follow raise Hba1c Initial visit ( I hour ) : Participants meet member research team obtain consent collect baseline blood sample , demographic QoL data . Participants randomise either intervention control arm use computer generate randomisation schedule . For participant intervention arm blood sample analyse Royal Devon &amp; Exeter National Health Service Foundation Trust ( RD &amp; E NHS FT ) Biochemistry Department HbA1c , C-peptide islet autoantibody ( GAD , IA2 ZnT8 ) DNA extract stored genetic test appropriate . These blood result immediately incorporated ODS feedback Clinicians participant recommendation appropriate national guideline ODS diagnosis ( e.g . NICE guideline Type 1 Type 2 diabetes ) follow . For participant control arm current clinical feature record blood sample store future analysis . At end involvement study , record clinical feature result store blood sample incorporate ODS feedback clinician participant . Follow ( 6 monthly interval 3 year ) : Participants follow 6 monthly interval 3 year period ( choice give text , phone , email ) maintain participant engagement enable collection detail current treatment , treatment change frequency hypoglycaemia . Results routinely collect HbA1cs obtain clinical practice . At 3 year , participant see research team collection blood sample , detail final treatment quality life measure . This end participation . At end study individual result ODS control ( standard care ) arm generate feed back clinician participant . All participant assign unique study ID . All data collect record stored ID number . Data initially record onto study specific data collection form ( DCF ) . Data record onto study specific database . Hard/scanned copy store study specific site file . Data screening discrepancy miss data prior analysis . Baseline data include : personal identifier , anthropometry , diabetes medication history blood biochemistry . Permission obtain access medical note require diabetes data relevant take part project . All participant data hold link-anonymised format , Participants ' research sample data identify unique study ID number data hold password-protected computer . Only CI designate research team member access personal identifiable data . Data Storage Archiving : All consent paper data collection form scan onto disc store lock file cabinet within controlled access ECRF duration project . Paper copy shred . Should full RCT develop project participant data sample transfer used analysis large study . If end study RCT yet commence , remain sample data transfer safe keep Peninsula Research Bank ( PRB ) . Sample analysis : Blood sample analyse HbA1c , C-peptide islet autoantibody ( GAD , IA2 ZnT8 ) site RD &amp; E NHS FT blood science department . DNA extract stored genetic test appropriate . Primary Outcome measure : Time optimum treatment follow diagnosis . Optimum treatment determine 3 year follow basis whether insulin require ( use C peptide test insulin HbA1c test insulin ) . If insulin require optimum treatment determine use treatment guideline T2D subtype MODY diagnose . Treatment record 6-monthly 3 year . Secondary outcome measure : Mean glycaemic control first 3y diagnosis , patient satisfaction , number hypo , weight change . Statistics Power Calculations The aim study determine feasibility future RCT , determine clinical difference . We therefore take pragmatic approach base number potential recruit available one year period . We estimate 220 people diagnose per year Exeter surround area . We invite patient fulfil entry criterion participate . This enable u determine realistic recruitment rate obtain estimate rate misclassification inform full RCT . Therefore , analysis restrict descriptive statistic Ethical consideration : We discuss potential ethical consideration member PRB steer committee address follow : Blood sampling : routine part diabetes care , may result slight pain bruising , risk minimize sample undertaken staff experience venepuncture procedure . Patient burden : participation involve 2 blood sample ( 3 year apart ) 5 follow contact 3 year period ( via participant choice phone/e-mail/text ) . This consider unduly burdensome . Immediate/delayed ODS feedback : follow considerable discussion around acceptability immediate delay feedback result ODS , lay member felt consider participant would receive treatment base current clinical NICE guideline delay feedback ODS result would acceptable . Subject Withdrawal : Subjects inform free withdraw study time sample data cod anonymised . When sample fully anonymised , participant still able withdraw sample associate data retain use analysis . Study Management : The study manage National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) Exeter Clinical Research Facility provide infrastructure support facilitate recruitment sample collection . Timescale : 4 year . This relatively long time pilot study necessary enable data collection participant , 3 year period , provide clinically relevant definition optimal treatment . All cost meet exist research funding : Sample analysis cost ( HbA1c/Serum c-peptide , islet autoantibody ( GAD , IA2 ZnT8 ) Genotyping appropriate ) cover CI 's exist Welcome Trust senior Investigator award . Service support cost provide NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility . Project development user involvement : The study team access user representative group NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility ( ECRF ) . In keep NHS Patient Carer Public Involvement ( PCPI ) strategy ECRF invite user representative contribute development various project within portfolio . These individual agree maintain contact regular meeting establish researcher discuss development current project within ECRF . Reporting adverse effect : This low risk study anticipate participant involve project subject adverse effect , slight bruise blood sample collection . The CI inform adverse effect within 24 hour report follow local NHS R &amp; D SOPs copy adverse event form store project site file . Participant Feedback : Depending randomization arm feedback ODS feed back participant GP immediately end study . Should biochemistry immunological genetic result potentially impact clinical care , result initially discuss ECRF Clinical Director decision may make contact individual participant GP healthcare team . A statement effect include consent form . Dissemination/implementation research : Results write submitted publication peer-reviewed journal . Abstracts submit national international conference . Potential impact benefit research : short term-we hope obtain necessary information conduct definitive RCT . Longer term-evidence ODS improve diagnosis treatment patient diagnose diabetes lead improve treatment quality life patient reduction NHS cost associated inappropriate treatment monitoring complication rate . End Study : study finish initial follow data collect analysed participant .</detailed_description>
