	<brief_title>18-FDG PET/CT Imaging Clinical Decisions Infective Endocarditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Infective endocarditis ( IE ) rare disease , often difficult diagnose high mortality rate . Extra-cardiac manifestation , occur 30 80 % case , impact outcome disease . Identifying manifestation may help confirm uncertain diagnosis optimize patient ' management . 18-FDG PET/CT imaging , widely use cancer stag , may also detect hyper-metabolic area relate extracardiac infectious complication IE . It provide opportunity detect extracardiac IE infectious complication single examination . The impact 18-FDG PET/CT imaging management IE yet completely evaluate . Hypothesis : 18-FDG PET/CT implementation could result shorten initial diagnostic work-up IE therapeutic optimization . Primary objective : To evaluate impact 18-FDG PET/CT patient ' management , measure change IE therapeutic plan . Secondary objective : - To evaluate impact 18-FDG PET/CT Duke-Li criterion IE diagnosis - To evaluate performance 18-FDG PET/CT detect valve damage extracardiac complication induce IE - To evaluate whether 18-FDG PET/CT may help identify infection 's portal entry - To evaluate whether detection extracardiac complication FDG PET/CT associate 6-months survival rate - To identify clinical biological determinant extracardiac IE localization prognosis - To determine inter-reader interpretation the18-FDG PET/CT result reproducibility preparation acquisition method</detailed_description>
