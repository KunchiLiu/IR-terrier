	<brief_summary>This study look effect combination palbociclib letrozole may estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer tumor yet treat . Letrozole type endocrine therapy call aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) standard treatment post-menopausal woman ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Randomized Study Evaluating Biological Clinical Effects Combination Palbociclib With Letrozole Neoadjuvant Therapy Post-Menopausal Women With Estrogen-Receptor Positive Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FB-11 study Phase II , randomize , open label , four arm study examine biological clinical effect neoadjuvant letrozole without palbociclib first-line treatment estrogen-receptor ( ER ) positive , HER2-negative early invasive breast cancer . The co-primary aim study compare change proliferation marker Ki67 , compare clinical response 14 week therapy letrozole without palbociclib . The FB-11 study initiative joint partnership NSABP Foundation , Inc. ( NSABP ) Department Site Study Management ( DSSM ) United Kingdom ( UK ) co-investigators Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Institute Cancer Research ( ICR ) . Parallel protocol conduct US Canada ( FB-11 ) , UK ( PALLET ) joint analysis interim final data . Postmenopausal woman , newly diagnose ER-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer , suitable candidate neoadjuvant endocrine therapy invite join FB-11/PALLET trial . Approximately 306 patient accrue study . Each collaborative group recruit least 1/3 2/3 target accrual . Patients randomize one four treatment arm ( 3:2:2:2 ratio ) . Treatment first 14 week neoadjuvant therapy : Arm A Letrozole alone ; Arm B Letrozole 2 week follow letrozole + palbociclib week 14 ; Arm C Palbociclib 2 week follow letrozole + palbociclib week 14 ; Arm D Letrozole + palbociclib week 14 . Letrozole administer orally 2.5mg daily tablet . Palbociclib administer orally 125mg capsule , daily schedule 3 week ( 21 day ) , 1 week ( 7 day ) 4 week [ 28 day ] cycle . The end study therapy patient Arm A completion week 14 . Patients Arms B , C , D complete study therapy follow 14 day palbociclib final treatment cycle past 14 week treatment delay occur . Note : After week 14 ( end study therapy ) patient continue letrozole surgery . Letrozole consider study therapy beyond completion week 14 Arm A 14 day palbociclib final treatment cycle patient Arms B , C , D. Following completion study therapy , surgery schedule 15-18 week post-randomization . Post-surgical treatment discretion treat clinician , follow local protocol , influenced allocation treatment within FB-11/PALLET study . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must postmenopausal woman define : Age 56 old spontaneous menses least 12 month prior study entry ; Age 55 young menses least 12 month prior study entry ( e.g. , spontaneous secondary hysterectomy ) document estradiol level postmenopausal range accord local institutional/laboratory standard ; Age great equal 18 documented bilateral oophorectomy . Operable ERpositive/HER2 negative , invasive early breast cancer , suitable neoadjuvant AI treatment . HER2negative determine American Society Clinical Oncology College American Pathologists ( ASCOCAP ) guideline . No know severe hypersensitivity reaction compound similar palbociclib palbociclib excipients endocrine treatment . A breast tumor ultrasound size least 2.0 cm . Patients must ability swallow oral medication . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . At time randomization , blood count perform within 4 week prior randomization must meet following criterion : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1500/mm3 ; Platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; Hemoglobin must great equal 10 g/dL . international normalized ratio ( INR ) must within normal limit local laboratory range . The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet : total bilirubin must less equal upper limit normal ( ULN ) lab unless patient bilirubin elevation great ULN 1.5 x ULN due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . Serum creatinine perform within 4 week prior study entry must less equal 1.25 x ULN estimate creatinine clearance le 60 mL/min ( calculate use method standard institution ) . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C abnormal liver function test . HIV positive patient receive antiviral . Premenopausal perimenopausal woman . Inflammatory/inoperable breast cancer . HER2positive determine use ASCOCAP Guidelines . Concurrent use ( define use within 4 week prior baseline tissue sample take ) hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) estrogencontaining medication ( include vaginal estrogen ) Prior endocrine therapy breast cancer . Any invasive malignancy within previous 5 year ( basal cell carcinoma cervical carcinoma situ ) . Other nonmalignant systemic disease would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require follow : Active infection chronic infection require chronic suppressive antibiotic ; Malabsorption syndrome , ulcerative colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , resection stomach small bowel , disease condition significantly affect gastrointestinal function ; Chronic daily treatment corticosteroid dose great equal 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent ( exclude inhale steroid ) ; Seizure disorder require medication . Diagnosis fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) alone excisional biopsy lumpectomy perform prior study entry . Surgical axillary staging procedure prior study procedure ( exception FNA core biopsy ) . Definitive clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease . History ipsilateral invasive breast cancer regardless treatment ipsilateral ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) treat radiotherapy contralateral invasive breast cancer time . Any treatment , include radiotherapy , chemotherapy , and/or target therapy , administer currently diagnose breast cancer prior study entry . Use medication substance strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A isoenzymes . Class III Class IV myocardial disease describe New York Heart Association ; recent history ( within 6 month ) myocardial infarction , symptomatic arrhythmia time randomization . Class III : Patients cardiac disease result marked limitation physical activity . Such patient comfortable rest . Less ordinary physical activity cause fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea , anginal pain . Class IV : Patients cardiac disease result inability perform physical activity without discomfort . Symptoms cardiac insufficiency anginal syndrome may present even rest . QTc great 480 msec family personal history long short QT syndrome , Brugada syndrome know history QTc prolongation , Torsade de Pointes ( TdP ) . The investigator ass patient determine psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude meeting study requirement .</criteria>
