	<brief_summary>Respiratory virus know risk factor asthma ( e.g respiratory syncytial virus , RSVs , Human Rhinoviruses , HRVs , may induce bronchiolitis , wheeze illness respectively ) . The common flu also know risk factor Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommend asthmatics receive annual flu vaccine , high-risk group relate asthma exacerbation . The investigator evaluate variation individual response time control immune activation follow influenza vaccination monozygotic twin , discordant asthma , concordant non-asthmatic . The transition initial healthy immune-system activate physiological state post vaccination provide unprecedented molecular ( omics ) data molecular dynamic immune response vaccination , novel insight flu response . The investigator infer novel network pathways well dynamic gene mechanism involve asthma , flu vaccination , individual response , correlate evaluate personalized genetic risk study . The investigator able also contrast vaccination response asthmatic non-asthmatic individual , longitudinal approach never perform use multiple-omics include immunization response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma pathogenesis exacerbation associate multiple risk factor , particularly respiratory virus . In child respiratory syncytial virus ( RSVs ) may induce bronchiolitis , Human Rhinoviruses ( HRVs ) also may induce wheeze illness . RSVs HRVs age dependent risk factor asthma , influenza virus also consider prominent risk factor adult . The Center Disease Control recommend influenza vaccination asthmatic annually . Both HRV RSV infection detect pilot integrative personal omics investigation , provide unique temporal expression signature non-asthmatic subject , involvement common set antigen defense response gene , well immune relate pathway . These observe pattern addition result vaccination study use guide , find difference healthy versus asthmatic patient ' pathway activation provide insight gene mechanism involve asthma pathogenesis immune response influenza vaccination . The twin paradigm allow u control multiple confound factor focus individual genetic possible epigenetic variation . The investigator able infer novel network pathway get gene mechanism involve asthma , flu vaccination , individual response , evaluate personalize genetic risk compare medical history study . Our primary investigation involve integrative multi-omics monitor individual monozygotic twin , healthy discordant asthma , follow flu vaccination , period two annual vaccination cycle . The investigator collect blood sample monozygotic twin volunteer , multiple time-points post influenza vaccination . The measurement repeat follow year second vaccination . Genomic sequence use evaluate volunteer 's genomic risk base variant know disease association . Full transcriptome ( via RNA-Sequencing ) , proteome metabolome profiling ( via mass spectrometry ) perform per time-point , well cytokine profiling . This allow dynamic monitoring thousand molecular component responses vaccination , capture initial innate response reaction addition adaptive response return baseline . The study involve follow response blood saliva component influenza vaccination . Two annual vaccination consider , one per year 2 year , 8 time point sample collect . This study involve simple blood draw , saliva collection , standard FDA-approved influenza vaccine administration Spirometry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Volunteers eligible participate study twin sibling agree participate . If enrollment study , one twin sibling decide withdraw , : 1 . If one sibling withdraws Year 1 , sibling allow continue participation study complete current study Year . However include randomly select applicant continue participation Year 2 study . 2 . If one sibling withdraws duringYear2 , sibling able conclude Year2 study activity . 1 . Volunteer under18 . 2 . Presence medical condition study investigator believe affect participation study result . 3 . Presence mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment would prevent subject adequately understanding , cooperate , study protocol . 4 . Volunteers severe allergy ( lifethreatening ) ever lifethreatening allergic reaction dose flu vaccine , know severe allergy part vaccine , advise participate . 5 . If potential subject ever GuillainBarr√© Syndrome ( severe paralyze illness , also call GBS ) , advise get influenza vaccine exclude study . For female participant If already enrol become pregnant study , investigator temporarily withdraw study day become pregnant . If would like stay study , investigator may continue participation delivery . If participant feel well schedule day vaccination investigator suggest postpone vaccination feel well . If agree , vaccination reschedule later date .</criteria>
