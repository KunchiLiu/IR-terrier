	<brief_summary>This study aim provide preliminary evidence validity sensor-based assessment rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) symptom , collect structure qualitative feedback RA Enbrel patient regard potential future biosensor/PRO mHealth application . The investigator ' overarch hypothesis patient well timely information whether Enbrel work , become empowered engaged treatment , curious may - may - working , potentially compliant therapy . However , hypothesis remain largely untested .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wireless Motion Sensors Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) often endure remit flare disease-course characterize considerable pain , stiffness , fatigue . The social emotional well-being RA patient suffer result . Data demonstrate adherence Enbrel significantly improve functional status health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) RA patient . Yet patient prescribed Enbrel often exhibit non-adherence early discontinuation , dose-stretching , reduce persistence follow medication `` holiday '' . The knowledge , attitude , belief hold patient regard RA Enbrel influence perception benefit , barrier , treatment . Decisions adhere occur combine level susceptibility severity provide motivation act , perception benefit ( less barrier ) indicate path action . A give patient 's ability follow path action hinge relative self-efficacy : conviction successfully execute behavior require produce expect outcome . Landscape literature review conduct CORE-UCLA suggest intervention target self-efficacy offer great chance improve adherence Enbrel . Self-efficacy play important mediate role self-management activity , allow adoption maintenance health behavior . Many study identify measure self-efficacy significant predictor adherence RA patient . Additionally - though caveat methodologically heterogeneous limited generalizability - number study find intervention target self-efficacy significantly improve adherence relate outcomes . Seminal work field - include Bandura 's Social Cognition Theory Rosenstock 's Health Beliefs Model - converge following recommendation behavioral intervention target self-efficacy : 1 . Identify reinforce patient 's past present successes accomplishment . 2 . Direct patient observe successful behavior cop mechanism similar others , even involve alter expand social network . 3 . Provide positive feedback patient 's effort encourage people patient 's social network , family member friend , . 4 . Facilitate patient adopt new health behavior ensure patient interpret incorrectly feel . Enabled recent advance microelectronics , signal processing algorithm , network capability , wireless health technology hold potential support numerous aspect recommendation . Namely , motion sensor might contribute formation complete feedback loop involve self- monitoring , data presentation , tailor messaging . Consumer Health Informatics ( CHI ) application offer complete feedback loop hold promise improve self-efficacy .</detailed_description>
