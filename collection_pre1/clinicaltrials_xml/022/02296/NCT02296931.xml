	<brief_summary>Pre-eclampsia eclampsia cause 50,000 death annually . While MgSO4 widely accept relatively inexpensive treatment condition , barrier delivery via IV injection low-resource setting pose large obstacle reduction mortality . AutoSyP low-cost , low-powered automatic syringe pump could overcome barrier delivery MgSO4 . We propose conduct pilot clinical evaluation ability deliver MgSO4 woman pre-eclampsia eclampsia Malawi . AutoSyP subject 2 phase pilot clinical community trial Malawi . Prior start study , nurse receive 4-hour training AutoSyP use ensure proper procedure follow . Phase 1 initial validation clinical performance device deliver standard IV saline 10 stable woman . The study continue Phase 2 , device deliver MgSO4 40 woman present symptoms pre-eclampsia . 1 . Prior start study , nurse receive 4-hour training AutoSyP use . 2 . Eligible willing participant provide informed consent . Then , baseline demographic relevant medical history information collect . 3 . In Phase 1 , subject receive IV saline fluid Nurse . In Phase 2 , Nurse provide load dose MgSO4 AutoSyP research staff monitor record device performance treatment specification . 4 . Subsequent maintenance dos saline MgSO4 administer observation monitor record 24 hour clinically indicate . Others may benefit study future AutoSyP new delivery system need break barrier IV delivery MgSO4 low-resource setting . The result study make available Ministry Health , NHSRC , COMREC , College Medicine Library , Department Paediatrics , partner work neonatal child health . Findings publish academic journal conference proceeding effort disseminate result potential end-users . The research finding study critical evaluation future intervention .</brief_summary>
