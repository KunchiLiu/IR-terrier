	<brief_title>Trametinib Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma With BRAF Non-V600 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy trametinib advance BRAF nonV600mutation ( MUT ) melanoma ( `` high activity '' group ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety trametinib . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) trametinib advance BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy trametinib advance BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma ( `` low activity/unknown '' group ) . II . Identify mechanisms resistance trametinib patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
