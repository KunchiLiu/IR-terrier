	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Three Different DNA HIV Vaccines Administered With MVA-CMDR Boost Vaccine Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity four different HIV vaccine healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . The vaccine include three DNA vaccines—DNA Nat-B env , DNA CON-S env , DNA Mosaic env—and vaccine call MVA-CMDR may boost immune response DNA vaccine . The study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected participant age 18 50 year . Participants randomly assign one three group receive either one experimental vaccine regimens placebo vaccine regimen . Group 1 participant receive DNA Nat-B env MVA-CMDR vaccine placebo . Group 2 participant receive DNA CON-S env MVA-CMDR vaccine placebo . Group 3 participant receive DNA Mosaic env MVA-CMDR vaccine placebo . All participant receive one assign vaccine study entry ( Month 0 ) , Months 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 . Total study duration either 3 year enrollment ( participant United States ) 5 year enrollment ( participant Switzerland ) . For participant , study visit occur study entry ( Month 0 ) , Months 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 8 , 8.25 , 8.5 , 11 , 13.75 , 14 . After last study visit , participant contact annually phone e-mail total 3 ( U.S. participant ) 5 ( Switzerland participant ) year answer question health . All study visit include physical exam , HIV risk reduction counseling , interview and/or questionnaire . Select study visit include blood collection , urine stool collection , HIV testing , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , pregnancy test participant bear female . For participant receive MVA-CMDR vaccine , select study visit may also include assessment cardiac symptom .</detailed_description>
