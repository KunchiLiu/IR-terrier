	<brief_title>Open-Label Study Evaluate Efficacy ECP Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II randomize , open-label study evaluate efficacy extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) versus IVMP disability progression subject SPMS . At initial screen visit , extensive medical history obtain detailed neurological examination perform determine eligibility . Subjects meet eligibility criterion enrol one two study arm . Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio receive ECP ( study arm ) active treatment intravenous methylprednisolone pulse ( control arm ) administer every 4 Weeks ( 1 gram per infusion ) 52 week . ECP administer accord follow schedule : Study Arm : Weeks 1-8 : 3 time per week Weeks 9-16 : Twice per week Weeks 17-36 : Treatment two consecutive day every 2 week ( optionally , one treatment per week ) Weeks 37-43 : Once every 2 week Weeks 44-52 : Once every 4 Weeks All subject , include patient receive corticosteroid , evaluate use MSFC tool baseline every 3 month 2 year . They also score use EDSS baseline every 3 month 2 year . Subjects control arm evaluate MSFC EDSS week prior next intravenous methylprednisolone infusion every three month baseline two year mark . Blood collect immune function ( cytokine ) test baseline , month 3 , 6 , 9 12 . MRI do baseline well month 6 12 follow initiation treatment ; disability measurement stable improve point time , ECP continue per protocol.. Patients ECP arm treatment CELLEX ® System . Patients randomize ECP arm must receive treatment within 5 day baseline visit . In ECP process , UVADEX ® ( methoxsalen ) Sterile Solution inject directly recirculation bag extracorporeal circuit completion buffy coat collection . The dose UVADEX® ( methoxsalen ) Sterile Solution calculate base standard treatment volume formula .</detailed_description>
