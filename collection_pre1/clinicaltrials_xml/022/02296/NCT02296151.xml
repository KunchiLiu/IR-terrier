	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine specific exercise routine incorporate progressive hip stability program help rehabilitate hip reduce symptom iliotibial band syndrome conventional hip exercise . Three different exercise intervention compare determine effectiveness reduce pain , improve function return subject run symptom free . Secondary objective study establish intervention program female runner injury . There three treatment arm participant randomly assign one three group : Group A- control ( stretch ) , group B ( conventional hip exercise group C ( experimental treatment- specific progressive hip exercise ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The gluteus medius muscle part muscle group call hip abductor muscle . The gluteus medius originate dorsal ilium ( uppermost , large bone pelvis ) iliac crest insert top outside surface great trochanter ( top thigh bone ) . It major abductor thigh ( move leg away midline body ) . The anterior fibre rotate hip internally posterior fibre rotate hip externally . Based anatomy function muscle , gluteus medius play major role mechanic run . Research show runner iliotibial band syndrome show weakness muscle . Most conventional exercise research exercise focus activation muscle unloaded position ( non-weightbearing ) . Group B study focus exercise research . Group C experimental group begin conventional exercise progress exercise floor ( unloaded ) position dynamic functional position ( stand ) . This geared towards run specific exercise . We would like know difference fast symptoms reduce strength gain occur rate .</detailed_description>
