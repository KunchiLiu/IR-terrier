	<brief_title>Blood Glucose Variability Obese Youth Participating Lifestyle Modification Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy lifestyle intervention program aim increase exercise teach youth healthy dietary option , hop avoid obesity complication diabetes , address root cause obesity . The program entitle Bright Bodies : A Lifestyle Intervention Program Obese Youth , test rigorously , show significant improvement body mass index insulin resistance 1 2 year program reversal early abnormality glucose metabolism . While abnormality standardize oral glucose tolerance test well describe obese youth , test may reflect `` real life '' glycemia change obese child . Understanding early glycemic change obese youth important good identify risk strategize effective treatment plan , avoid progression prediabetes diabetes . Thus use continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) may helpful adjunct understanding disease therapy approach patient . A CGM device insert skin abdomen monitor glucose level every 5 minute , record information . CGM commonly wear kid type 1 diabetes . The study allow collection information glucose variability much great detail see intermittent fingerstick glucose value oral glucose tolerance test . Given widespread epidemic obesity complication , ability illustrate glycemic variability obese youth key delineate risk category optimize treatment . While lifestyle modification program effective improve measure insulin sensitivity OGTT result , effect real life glucose value describe . Hence current study , aim describe day-to-day glycemic variation obese youth use CGM . All enrolled subject wear CGM 7 day prior initiation Bright Bodies program , 7 day end program . Additionally subject complete food record report exercise study period . The study period take place 2 month prior 2 month complete Bright Bodies program . The study explain volunteer meet eligibility criterion inform consent/assent obtain . Demographic data record . Medical history obtain brief physical exam may perform . Height , weight , BMI , percent body fat , fat mass , fat free mass measure . After enrollment subject meet study personnel learn keep food record , intermittent phone contact study personnel optimize food record compliance . They also ask record exercise medication take . A blinded CGM insert begin study period . Subjects educate regard CGM , include requirement measure blood glucose level glucometer 3 time day , least every 12 hour ( ideally wake morning eating , dinner , bedtime ) , calibrate sensor . Subjects give glucometer obtain fingerstick blood sugar value receive instruction regard use . During follow visit CGM remove , CGM glucometer download collect . The food record collect .</detailed_description>
