	<brief_title>An Observational Study Determine Clinical Cure Rate Therapeutic Front Shave Removal Basal Cell Carcinoma Skin With Long Term Follow Evaluate Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common skin cancer world , approximately 3.5 million case year diagnose United States . BCC indolent metastasis extremely rare , occur less .003 % case . However , due high prevalence tumor , significant health care resource use diagnosis treatment . Management BCC many instance include clinical evaluation lesion , biopsy sample lesion confirm diagnosis , follow definitive treatment later date surgical excision medical therapy . A clinical diagnosis BCC make high degree confidence base clinical finding . The investigator propose perform deep shave removal entire lesion histologically negative margin , base upon clinical diagnosis , complete removal achieve without need follow therapy . Deep shave removal time initial evaluation perform many instance . The investigator believe deep shave removal would substantially reduce number second procedure need do , thereby reduce treatment cost patient ' need return additional procedure . In deep shave removal , clinically diagnose BCC remove entirely narrow 2-3 mm margin , tissue specimen send pathologist confirm margin clear . The investigator consider treatment BCC complete point follow patient clinically .</detailed_description>
