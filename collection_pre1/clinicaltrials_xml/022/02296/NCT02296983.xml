	<brief_summary>Previous Ebola outbreak limit individual country contain infection control activity . The current outbreak West Africa international , air travel result number infected traveller cross national border . There currently specific treatment generally available Ebola mortality high , particularly country limit intensive care facility . There currently vaccine personal protection require healthcare worker treat patient cumbersome require full compliance protective . There consortium ( VEBCON collaboration ) four clinical centre ( Kenya , Gabon , Switzerland Germany ) , WHO New Link Genetics ( vaccine manufacturer ) study conduct . The investigator conduct trial , Phase I , open-label , dose escalation trial , design establish safety , tolerability immunogenicity two dose VSVΔG-ZEBOV , Ebola Virus Vaccine Candidate first time sub-Saharan African population . The investigator plan vaccinate 40 volunteer Kenya . The trial conduct KEMRI-CGMR Coast site healthcare worker ( clinical laboratory ) primary target population likely recipient protective vaccine . The investigator vaccinate cohort 20 volunteer low dose vaccinate cohort 20 volunteer full dose . Each volunteer receive one dose vaccine . The investigator follow period one year look safety immunogenicity endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Find Out New Ebola Vaccine Safe Stimulates Immunity That Might Protect Adults Kilifi , Kenya .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct assess safety immunogenicity experimental ebola vaccine . An outbreak due Ebola Zaire ( ZEBOV ) strain unprecedented magnitude scope high mortality continue spread across West Africa . No vaccine currently license . The specific opportunity hand rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP ( BPSC1001 ) achieve long-lasting protective immunity ZEBOV time scale week humans upon single-shot vaccination , offer discrete benefit prime-boost vaccination protocol . The current outbreak represent global health emergency need access therapeutic intervention vaccine paramount . The vaccine investigate study might provide critical tool suppress future out-breaks EVD area risk . This study 1 4 clinical trial currently conduct part WHO-led VEBCON consortium , aim generate harmonize data rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP ( BPSC1001 ) vaccine candidate allow optimize rapid decision dose safety .</detailed_description>
