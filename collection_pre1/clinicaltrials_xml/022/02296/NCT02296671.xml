	<brief_summary>In study investigator aim : 1 ) confirm objective response rate ( ORR ) observe investigator initial study patient TSER*2/*2 genotype 2 ) determine whether PEMOX regimen worthy future development patient genotype select population FOLFOX base data indicate pemetrexed may better TS targeted agent 5-FU . Patients homozygous TSER*2 allele ( TSER*2/*2 ) able continue study randomize . Patients TSER genotype include consider screen fails . The first 8 patient TSER*2/*2 genotype randomize 1:1 receive treatment either PEMOX FOLFOX ( 4 group ) . Analysis objective response rate ( ORR ) treatment arm occur first 8 patient enrol . Using proposed Bayesian design , subsequent patient preferentially assign `` well perform '' treatment arm base continuous real-time reassessment ORR result .</brief_summary>
