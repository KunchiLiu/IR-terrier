	<brief_summary>Brief Summary Context . Sleep disorder complaint common elderly hypnosedative drug widely prescribe community-dwelling elderly . Furthermore , acute hospitalisation may induce sleep disorder hypnosedative initiation occur 14 29 % elderly hospital stay . These hospital-induced sleep disorder spontaneously disappear discharge , potential impact fall , hip fracture , psychiatric side effect induce dependence , hypnosedative drug therefore discontinue discharge naïve-treated patient . Adhesion recommendation poor . Recent on-going research topic mostly concern adverse effect although already substantially document evidence-based , poor interest develop research potential strategy susceptible practically improve current adhesion recommendation . Design objectives . This project propose multi-component intervention direct towards hospital prescribers , patient , general practitioner . It aim discontinue , hospital discharge , hypnosedative treatment initiate hospitalization naïve-treated elderly ( age≥65 ) patient . The value intervention , compare usual care management , estimate multicentre ( 6 hospital gather 8 centre : 5 internal medicine department , 3 cardiology department ) randomise , cross-over , two-period trial . Two hospital gather 2 centre ( 2x2 centre ) 4 hospital gather 1 centre ( 4x1 centre ) . An equilibrated randomization apply 8 centre , make sure , hospital gather 2 centre , 2 centre apply strategy give period 2 hospital apply alternative strategy . This randomisation set avoid risk potential contamination 2 strategy one centre within hospital . As result , 3 hospital ( include 4 medical department ) apply intervention first 11-month period , 3 others ( include 4 medical department ) apply usual care period , result equilibrate hospital randomization . During second 11-month period , hospital apply alternative management . The two period separate 1-month wash-out period . In 240 patient ( 15 patient / centre ) enrol ( 120 intervention group 120 usual care group ) . Patient follow-up duration 12 month discharge . Patient status regard quality sleep ( study primary objective ) , hypnosedative consumption frequency fall ( secondary objective ) collect telephone interview 1 , 3 , 6 12 month discharge . Expected result . The result study contribute guide research public decision practically decrease hypnosedative prescription consumption , associate adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Decrease Exposure Hypnosedative Drugs Elderly Through Discontinuation Hospital-initiated Prescription</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context Hypnosedative prescription hospital either continuation drug already prescribe admission result initiation hospitalization . In hospitalised population , 36.7 % 62.7 % patient indeed complain significant insomnia . Furthermore , clearly establish number factor associate hospitalization effect illness new medication , environmental factor include noise disruption usual sleeping schedule induce insomnia decrease quality sleep . For reason , 33 % 60 % hospitalised patient treat hypnosedatives . Hospital initiation hypnosedatives report 14 % 29 % patient take hypnosedative hospitalization . Unfortunately , study make discontinuation drug hospital discharge , still show drug maintain 20 36 % initiated patient . In elderly , hypnosedatives provide small improvement quality sleep fall cognitive disorder significantly increase . Due dependence benzodiazepine , withdrawal syndrome may occur discontinuation long term treatment . Therefore , benefit/risk balance hypnosedative favour use elderly . Moreover , sleep disturbance appear acute hospital stay time transient continuation systematically debate . However , best knowledge , data yet report evaluation intervention aim discontinue prescription discharge hospital formerly hypnosedative-naïve patient . Design The HYPAGE study multicentre , cluster-randomized , two-period cross-over study test intervention ( compare usual care ) discontinue hypnosedative prescription time hospital discharge patient age 65 year . Six hospital gather 8 centre ( 5 internal medicine department , 3 cardiology department ) locate Paris area participate study . Two hospital gather 2 centre ( 2x2 centre ) 4 hospital gather 1 centre ( 4x1 centre ) . An equilibrated randomization apply 8 centre , make sure , hospital gather 2 centre , 2 centre apply strategy give period 2 hospital apply alternative strategy . This randomisation set avoid risk potential contamination 2 strategy one centre within hospital . As result , 3 hospital ( include 4 medical department ) apply intervention first 11-month period , 3 others ( include 4 medical department ) apply usual care period , result equilibrate hospital randomization . During second 11-month period , hospital apply alternative management . The two period separate 1-month wash-out period . Description intervention . The intervention study include two component involve local hospital pharmacist , first component towards physician , second towards patient . The intervention towards physician compose follow item : 1 . A write oral information deliver hospital physician . Such information include : - Place hypnosedatives among drug risk elderly - Adverse drug event induced hypnosedatives : prevalence fall elderly , psychiatric adverse event . - Procedures hypnosedative withdrawal ( French recommendation , HAS 2007 ) - The oral presentation present staff meeting physician every centre enter study begin intervention period . The oral presentation deliver local pharmacist centre enter trial , accord standardize slide show ( i.e . slide + accompany talk ) prepare scientific committee study . 2 . In patient hypnosedative initiate , medication reconciliation discharge involve local hospital pharmacist . Medication reconciliation refers process review patient 's complete medication regimen time admission , transfer , discharge compare regimen consider new set care . The pharmacist compare medication list hospital stay discharge prescription . If hypnosedative maintain discharge , discussion physician opportunity hypnosedative continuation , two alternative decision may choose : - If physician decides maintain hypnosedative drug , reason register - If physician decides stop hypnosedative , standardize text include usual letter transmit patient 's general practitioner hospital discharge . It indicate hypnosedative initiate patient hospitalization stop discharge ( progressively decrease aim discontinuation ) , briefly mention adverse effect relate continuation hypnosedative use , advocate reintroduction base sound argument . Therefore , intervention include component orient towards continuity care discharge , component direct towards general practitioner . Intervention towards patient Intervention towards patient consist delivery write information . The write information accompany talk pharmacist delivery heighten awareness hypnosedative-related risk adverse drug event : relation hypnosedatives fall , uselessness hypnosedatives home hospital discharge . Patient follow-up Patients include day discharge followed-up 12 month . A study pharmacist enrol charge collect follow-up data patient , whatever admission centre . The study pharmacist call ( phone call ) patient surrogate , general practitioner community pharmacist 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month hospital discharge . He assess current treatment collect data concerning : - The quality sleep ( Insomnia Severity Index score ) - The current hypnosedative treatment Frequency fall assessed fall diary . This fall diary provide patient discharge fill patient . The diary sent study pharmacist monthly basis ( envelop stamp provide hospital discharge ) . Objectives The primary objective study assess intervention produce deterioration quality sleep quality ( non-inferiority design ) compare usual care . The primary criterion quality sleep patient 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month hospital discharge . The Insomnia Severity Index score differ The secondary objective follow : - Comparing frequency fall intervention usual care group . - Measuring frequency hypnosedative reintroduction 1 , 3 , 6 12 month discharge hypnosedative prescription stop hospital discharge . - Comparing Insomnia Severity Index score treat untreated patient hypnosedative drug 1 , 3 , 6 12 month . - Comparing frequency fall treat versus untreated patient hypnosedative drug 1 , 3 , 6 12 month . Sample size There formula non inferiority design cluster cross-over trial , therefore chose calculate sample size traditional parallel group design apply design effect link cluster centre period . The calculation base follow hypothesis : mean ISI score patient treat hypnosedative medication 8 standard deviation 5 , non inferiority limit 3 , power 90 % one-sided type I error 0.025 . The sample size non inferiority trial without account intra-cluster interperiod correlation , 63 per arm , i.e . 126 patient total . With hypothesized intracluster correlation 0.03 interperiod correlation 0.01 ( NB : cross-over clustered trial , widely accept intracluster correlation least twice interperiod correlation , value low ) , design effect 1.29 [ 36 ] . The result calculated sample size 162 , round 180 order take account patient lose follow . Based participation 6 centre ( original number centre ) , result 15 patient per period per centre . We keep number 15 patient per period per centre addition 2 centre ( 8 include centre ) order achieve least power . This lead 240 patient . With regard average length stay number bed , estimate number patient enrol one semester center ( bad case calculation ) . Statistics Results quantitative variable provide mean standard deviation median interquartile , result qualitative variable provide number percentage . A type I error set 0.05 . To account cluster cross-over matching , comparison group make use Mantel-Haenszel Wilcoxon sign rank test . Confidence interval calculate use resampling bootstrap method . Analysis set . The primary analysis conduct accord intent-to-treat principle ( ITT ) , individual level , consider every patient include irrespective patient 's follow-up take account cluster nature data . Due non-inferiority design , secondary sensitivity analyse per-protocol population also conduct . Missing value ITT analysis : check whether proportion miss value differ one arm . For patient miss endpoint assume modification quality sleep discharge ( i.e . variation ISI score 0 ) . More conservative sensitivity analysis conduct , imputed increase ISI score 3 ( non inferiority limit ) intervention arm v impute increase ISI score 0 control arm . Methods Main endpoint analysis . The analysis perform individual level . A comparison make mean ISI score two arm . We use linear mixed effect model perform comparison , fixed effect : period , arm , cluster , random effect : order strategy individual residual error . The conclusion non inferiority base confrontation lower limit confidence interval pre-specified non inferiority limit ( 3 point ) . Methods Secondary endpoint analysis . The analysis secondary endpoint perform use methodological framework take account cluster period effect . For binomial variable , alternate logistic regression model use .</detailed_description>
