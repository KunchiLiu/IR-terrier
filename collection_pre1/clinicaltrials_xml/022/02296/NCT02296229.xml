	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study stereotactic body radiation therapy treat patient high-risk prostate cancer spread nearby lymph node part body . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Studying quality life patient undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy may help identify long-term effect treatment patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish efficacy stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) patient high-risk localized prostate cancer compare historical data clinical trial . II . To establish safety physician-reported outcome SBRT patient high risk localize prostate cancer . III . To establish quality life patient-reported validated questionnaire SBRT patient high risk localize prostate cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo SBRT daily every day total 5 fraction exceed 14 consecutive day . Patients may also receive androgen deprivation therapy 9 month discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 5 year , every 12 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
