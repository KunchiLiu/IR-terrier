	<brief_title>Intrathecal Pump Refill Undergoing Regular Intrathecal Pump Refill</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrathecal drug therapy implantable intrathecal pump utilized increasingly treatment chronic refractory pain spasticity . However , perform regular refill procedure pump commonly perform `` blind '' technique caries potential risk medication injection subcutaneous tissue , lead overdose . Objective : The primary purpose study assess accuracy ultrasound-guided technique refill procedure compare blind technique subject undergo regular refill intrathecal pump treatment chronic non-malignant pain spasticity . Study design : Mono-center prospective efficacy reliability study compare two approach enter fill port . Study population : The investigator include patient intrathecal pump treatment chronic non-malignant pain spasticity , undergo regular refill intrathecal pump Centro Terapia del Dolore Ospedale Italiano Viganello ( EOC , Switzerland ) . Intervention : Two different experience clinician perform one time blind technique two time ultrasound-guided technique patients.sample size calculation perform . The sample size i.e . n=25 patient NSI-TD-001 Protocol v. 1.0 Final : August 4th , 2014 Confidential Page 31 40 total assess 6 six time therefore base practical ground related feasibility duration inclusion ( i.e . one year ) . This would imply 50 paired assessment fill port accuracy assessment intra-rater reliability . The investigator believe base clinical experience number would suffice detect difference method . Likewise , although formal power calculation available ICC base reliability assessment , rule thumb 50 paired assessment usually consider adequate evaluate intra-rater liability .</detailed_description>
