	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient high risk increase serum glucose level , lead comorbidity high mortality risk . In patient severe sepsis septic shock hyperglycemia typical finding . However need insulin therapy associate increase risk hypoglycemia . Newly develop technology continuous glucose monitoring critically ill patient may improve glycemic control reduce glucose variability . The investigator perform continuous glucose monitoring critically ill patient ICU . Measurements do period 72h per patient . The investigator aim evaluate accuracy feasibility acceptance method . To analyze accuracy sensor glucose level validate due arterial blood gas measurement blood gas analyzer . The investigator investigate influence several factor like oedema , perspiration , BMI , body temperature , pH-value application vasoconstrictor accuracy feasibility particular system . Furthermore Nursing staff give questionnaire identify acceptance .</brief_summary>
