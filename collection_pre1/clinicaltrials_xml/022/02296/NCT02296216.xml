	<brief_summary>Transsphenoidal surgery first-line treatment acromegaly . Adjunctive radiotherapy necessary surgery ineffective avoid prolong medical treatment . Several study report long-term extra-pituitary side-effects conventional radiotherapy . However , none evaluate potential side-effects induced Gamma Knife radiosurgery , highly precise stereotactic technique , use effective treatment acromegaly . Aims study : To determine potential long-term ( superior 10 year ) extra-pituitary side-effects Gamma Knife radiosurgery patient treat Acromegaly . Methods : Transversal exposed/unexposed study . Exposed patient treat Gamma Knife Radiosurgery unsuccessful surgery 10-20 year inclusion , whereas unexposed patient treat somatostatin analog unsuccessful surgery least 10 year inclusion . 80 Patients ( 40 patients/group ) evaluate term cognitive dysfunction , quality life , secondary tumor , stroke , pituitary deficit growth hormone control hypersecretion . Recruitment plan last 2 year . Expected result : We able determine whether Gamma Knife radiosurgery long-term safe technique . This result might modify management follow-up patient acromegaly unsuccessfully treat surgery .</brief_summary>
