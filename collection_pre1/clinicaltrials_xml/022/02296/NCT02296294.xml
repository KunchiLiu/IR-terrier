	<brief_summary>This volunteer study test recently develop whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy device call Body Composition Monitor ( BCM ) measure body composition ( i.e . water content body ) . Specifically , investigator evaluate use BCM correct detection intravenous administer crystalloids volunteers´ fluid compartment . Furthermore test change time volunteers´ volume status intravenous fluid therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Technically assist assessment volume status may useful direct fluid administration . As prerequisite investigator test recently develop whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy device determine fluid status volunteer intravenous fluid therapy . The correlation infuse fluid change fluid status measure Body Composition Monitor ( BCM , Fresenius Medical Care , Germany ) still unknown . Using three-compartment physiologic tissue model , BCM determine total body fluid volume ( TBV ) , extracellular volume ( ECV ) , intracellular volume ( ICV ) fluid overload ( FO ) surplus deficit 'normal ' extracellular volume . The BCM device measure resistance reactance 50 discrete frequency cover frequency spectrum 5 1000 kHz entire patient via 4 electrode place wrist ankle . Fifteen volunteer enrol randomize , blind cross study . After randomisation one two treatment volunteer receive either iv isotonic fluid therapy Elo-mel® ( Fresenius Kabi Austria ) rate 0,50ml/kg/min one hour fluid therapy . At second study day volunteer obtain opposite treatment . We perform BCM measurement every 10 minute , treatment 6 hour BCM result return baseline . The result store BCM patient card automatically . The main objective study detect administer iv fluid extracellular compartment respectively FO , TBV ICV . Secondary outcome parameter include change time ICV , ECV , TBV FO iv therapy study day `` Fluid Therapy '' .</detailed_description>
