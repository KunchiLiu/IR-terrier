	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study ERK1/2 Inhibitor BVD-523 Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform assess safety tolerability BVD-523 give orally , twice daily 21-day cycle . Part 1 study establish dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . In Part 2 study , additional patient particular tumor type and/or cancer harbor specific genetic mutation recruit treatment Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) . Patients may also assessed pharmacodynamic measure healthy malignant tissue , use biomarker assay phosphorylation , cytotoxic cytostatic measure .</detailed_description>
