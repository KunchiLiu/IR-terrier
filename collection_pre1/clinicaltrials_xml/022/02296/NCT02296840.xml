	<brief_summary>Adenotonsillectomy one common surgical procedure perform pediatric population United States . It generally well-tolerated procedure post-operative bleeding risk range 3-5 % child . Post-operative pain follow adenotonsillectomy significant morbidity may result prolonged hospital stay re-admission hospital . Post-operative analgesia commonly manage narcotic-containing pain medication . In recent year however , evidence patient may manifest increased sensitivity narcotic , result life-threatening respiratory compromise . Though theoretical risk nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) increase bleed time disrupt platelet aggregation , evidence detrimental effect ( i.e . increase risk postoperative bleeding ) remain inconclusive generally well-tolerated medication . The goal study determine incidence post-operative bleeding determine efficacy NSAIDs management post-operative pain follow pediatric adenotonsillectomy , versus commonly use narcotic pain medication . The study design initial retrospective study collect pilot data incidence postoperative hemorrhage indicator adequate/inadequate pain control child age 4 17 undergoing adenotonsillectomy . This follow prospective , randomize , single-blind control study orally-administered ibuprofen ( test intervention ) compare acetaminophen-hydrocodone ( control intervention ) postoperative period follow adenotonsillectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-operative Pain Control After Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pain management pediatric patient undergo adenotonsillectomy challenge child , also clinician caregiver . Uncontrolled pain carry high level morbidity result prolong hospital stay and/or readmission , dehydration , weight loss , undesirable effect . In light recent high-profile controversy regard safety codeine search effective safe analgesia continue . The American Academy Otolaryngology—Head Neck Surgery ( AAO-HNS ) guideline suggest NSAIDs safe use post-operative period . Here , investigator compare bleed risk pain control use acetominphonen-hydrocodone ( control ) versus ibuprofen ( intervention ) post-operative period pediatric patient undergo adenotonsillectomy . The investigator hypothesize ibuprofen associate increase bleed risk control post-operative pain well acetominphonen-hydrocodone . 1 . Initial retrospective chart review ( Data extract patient ' chart ) : - Demographic data - Surgical data - Postoperative data - Descriptive analysis determine incidence postoperative bleeding follow adenotonsillectomy relation demographic factor surgical factor , incidence postoperative pain problem relation demographic surgical factor . 2 . Prospective , randomize , single-blind trial - Study Group Allocation/Randomization : Study participant randomize two post-operative pain medication treatment arm , use block randomization . Patients randomized test intervention arm receive ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg/day every 6-8 hour ) surgery . Patients randomize control intervention receive hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day every 4-6 hour ) . This randomization perform Ansley Roche MD , co-investigator . The operating surgeon unaware group assignment time randomization , time surgery , post-operative period . ( The participant caregiver blind type post-operative pain medication receive . ) Once study participant randomize group , group assignment information provide otolaryngology resident Egleston . The resident write appropriate prescription provide patient 's family prior discharge . - Postoperative pain assessment : Using Faces Pain Scale , pediatric patient indicate his/her pain level schedule interval . Pain level record caregiver pain medication administer appropriately base level patient 's self-reported pain . A log pain medication administer keep dose give . The total amount pain medication administer per kg per day calculate study staff upon completion pain medication log . Prior surgery , member study team conduct brief standard training session parent teach correctly complete medication log . - Breakthrough pain : Patients randomized test intervention arm receive ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg/day every 6-8 hour ) surgery . Patients randomize control intervention receive hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day every 4-6 hour ) . Both post-operative intervention group study surgery preoperative indication ( adenotonsillitis sleep disorder breathing ) . If patient experience pain control specify intervention group medication , protocol place breakthrough pain , indicate . Surgeons blind intervention arm . For patient pain controlled randomize intervention , breakthrough pain protocol enact . The protocol follow : - Test intervention arm 1 . Give hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day hydrocodone ) pain score ≥6 ever 6 hour . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . 2 . Increase hydrocodone-acetaminophen dose 0.2mg/kg/day hydrocodone per dose . - Control intervention arm 1 . Increase dose hydrocodone-acetaminophen 0.2 mg/kg/day hydrocodone For pain score ≥ 6 . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . 2 . Ibuprofen 10mg/kg/day every 6 hour . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . 3 . Acetaminophen 10mg/kg/day every 6 hour need . Implementation breakthrough pain protocol document . In order maintain surgeon blind throughout study , patient phone call rout chief resident call follow breakthrough pain protocol . A study staff member , exclude surgeon , contact parents/caretakers post-operative day 3 post-operative day 7 assist medication log completion answer medical question .</detailed_description>
