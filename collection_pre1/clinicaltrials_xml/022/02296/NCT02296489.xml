	<brief_summary>Asthma common chronic disorder airway characterize period reversible airflow obstruction know asthma episode attack . Asthma attack cause chronically hyperactive ( contraction muscle surround airway ) inflame airway , lead airflow obstruction , may mild , moderate , severe enough become life-threatening event . Severity asthma exacerbation assess medical history lung function measurement Spirometer require full cooperation patient . Thus , uncooperative population emergency medical situation spirometer use . As alternative , capnography data propose indicator bronchospasm asthma . Previous study find correlation capnography parameter methacholine challenge asthma patient . However , relationship capnography parameter severity asthma severity asthma exacerbation well characterize . The study hypothesis within clinical population invite methacholine challenge , different waveform pattern asthma patient detect possibly correlation severity obstruction pattern waveform methacholine challenge . In proposed feasibility observational study , sixty subject , men woman , invited participate methacholine challenge Institute Pulmonary Medicine Rabin Medical Center , recruit study . Respiratory information record use CapnostreamTM20p subject wear non-invasive Smart CapnoLineÂ® Plus sample line . Additionally , FeNO measure use DENOX 88 device methacholine challenge .</brief_summary>
