	<brief_summary>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) heterogeneous group neoplasm skin-homing T cell include Mycosis Fungoid ( MF ) , common , Sézary syndrome ( SS ) , leukemia variant MF , variant CTCL le prevalent . Clinical manifestation prognosis highly variable . Improving management incurable disease limit toxicity main point current research . Romidepsin well-tolerated histone deacetylase inhibitor demonstrate activity advance stage CTCL . In November 2009 , approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment CTCL patient receive least one prior systemic therapy . FDA-dose approve 14 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 21 day-cycle . It say continue long patient receive benefit tolerates drug . We experience clinic long-term ( &gt; 6 month ) use Romidepsin , even spar dos allow patient maintain disease complete remission control without severe side effect . We aim demonstrate many patient benefit maintenance therapy , detect side effect relate long-term use Romidepsin , well characterize patient get benefit therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Use Romidepsin Patients With CTCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project retrospective prospective chart review patient present Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation clinic diagnosis CTCL . It include Mycosis Fungoid , Sézary Syndrome subtypes CTCL , like Cytotoxic Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Those patient receive prescribed per standard care romidepsin least 1 month ( least 1 cycle treatment ) review . We estimate 50 patient could fit criterion , since drug start prescribed Dermatology Clinic . Clinical information regard diagnosis , stage , prior treatment receive , therapeutic response record . Blood parameter cell blood count , calcium , magnesium , potassium , albumin baseline treatment romidepsin review , record abnormality detect . Electrocardiogram change also check record . All information gather excel spreadsheet order perform descriptive analysis . We aim assess use romidepsin maintenance therapy ass schedule treatment frequently use associate well response few side effect .</detailed_description>
