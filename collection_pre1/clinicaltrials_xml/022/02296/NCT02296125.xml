	<brief_title>AZD9291 Versus Gefitinib Erlotinib Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , double-blind , randomise study assess efficacy safety AZD9291 ( 80 mg orally , daily ) versus standard care ( SoC ) Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) ( either gefitinib [ 250 mg orally , daily ] erlotinib [ 150 mg orally , daily ] ) patient locally advanced metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) know EGFR sensitise mutation ( EGFRm ) positive , treatment-naïve eligible first-line treatment EGFR-TKI .</detailed_description>
