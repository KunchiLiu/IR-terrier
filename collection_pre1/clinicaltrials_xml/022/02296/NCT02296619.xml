	<brief_title>The Effects Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Patients Undergoing Total Abdominal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain one main cause poor perioperative outcome pain management important part perioperative period . Neuraxial block could provide adequate analgesia abdominal surgery . However , neuraxial block lot contraindicate situation neuraxial anesthesia easily induce hemodynamic abnormality . Therefore , case , choice anaesthetic management may general anesthesia . In addition reduce blood pressure heart rate change due surgical stimulation , large amount opioids anaesthetic may require . Opioid related side effect affect perioperative complication postoperative quality recovery . Transversus abdominis plane block new choice reduce postoperative pain abdominal surgery . Although postoperative analgesic efficacy well know , effect hemodynamic variable , anaesthetic analgesic requirement clear . The main objective study estimate effect Transversus abdominis plane block hemodynamic variable , anaesthetic analgesic requirement quality recovery patient undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
