	<brief_summary>Biomedical device , artificial joint pacemaker , accept commonly use medicine . While great progress biomedical device make many disorder , currently device available assist act deglutition . The investigator develop biomedical device ( Swallow Expansion Device , SED ) assist swallow mechanically open upper esophageal sphincter allow food liquid safely enter esophagus . The SED proven safe cadaver live animal study ( Belafsky , 2010 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Swallow Expansion Device ( SED ) Improvement Swallowing Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate SED safely effectively improve swallow . Many people severe swallow disability ( dysphagia ) open upper esophageal sphincter , circular band muscle act like valve , allow food enter esophagus ( food pipe ) go stomach . People extreme dysphagia may cough choke food , liquid , even saliva . These people always risk food/liquid/saliva accidently enter lung . This cause pneumonia , case , death . The SED develop University California , Davis , improve swallowing . The idea SED begin 6 people , feed tube 100 % nutrition severe swallow disability , long suture thread attach throat . Patients pull two end suture thread forward able open upper esophageal sphincter . In fact , swallow improve much 3 patient go home suture place could eat mouth . Unfortunately , skin around suture become red painful within 2-9 day use . The suture remove , idea SED born . Since suture study , three different model SED develop , subsequent model well able improve swallowing , patient safety use common medical test . The current SED model look like letter `` T '' office tack use stick paper wall board . The SED plate post . The plate like top part `` T '' smooth part tack . The plate attach cartilage flexible connective tissue throat . The SED post like bottom part `` T '' pointy part tack , instead end point , end small ring . The post permanently stick throat , like skin piercing , neck skin heals plate . Healing take 8 week . The SED make titanium metal extremely strong commonly use medical device put body , hip joint bone plat . A person eat SED food enter esophagus SED post pull forward finger ring . Both sheep human cadaver study show SED work extremely well widely open upper esophageal sphincter . The University California , Davis , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) determine SED ready test small human study .</detailed_description>
