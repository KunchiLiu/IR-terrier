	<detailed_description>We collect ancillary data ongoing Examination Mechanisms exercise-induced weight compensation ( E-Mechanic ; RCT ; Martin CK Church TS Co-PI 's ; R01 HL 102166 ) investigate independent aim hypothesis pilot feasibility ( P &amp; F ) grant examine difference colonic microbial population fecal sample follow supervise control aerobic exercise . The propose study seek well understand role colonic microbial population mechanism change body weight aerobic exercise . E-Mechanic examine effect 2 tightly control supervised dos aerobic exercise , no-exercise control group , energy balance body weight 24 wks overweight obese person . The two aerobic exercise dos : 1 ) 8 kcal/kg body weight/week ( KKW ) ( ~900 kcal/wk ) 2 ) 20 KKW ( ~2250 kcal/wk ) compare exercise control group . The low dose exercise ( 8 KKW ) represent American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) recommendation overall health high dose ( 20 KKW ) recommendation weight loss weight loss maintenance . Aim 1 To investigate colonic bacterial population differ exercise group healthy live control group follow aerobic exercise . It hypothesize participant exercise group different bacterial population healthy live control group .</detailed_description>
