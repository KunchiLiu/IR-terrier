	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Open Label , Phase I Dose Escalation Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Intravenous SAIT301 Subjects With Advanced c-MET Positive ( + ) Solid Tumors Followed Expansion Selected Tumor Types</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study follow : - To evaluate safety tolerability SAIT301 . - To determine MTD SAIT301 dose level SAIT301 dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe subject advance solid tumor define recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) alternative establish MTD . Methodology : This first man study consist 2 stage . Stage 1 dose escalation study 3 + 3 design evaluate safety , tolerability , PK profile , biomarkers , preliminary anti-tumor activity ascend dos SAIT301 subject c-MET + advance solid tumor define MTD ( recommend Phase II dose [ RP2D ] ) SAIT301 . If PK trough level exceed minimum acceptable trough level SAIT301 ( 25 μg/mL ) , Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) may elect terminate dose escalation declare recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) schedule alternative establishing MTD . In Stage 2 MTD ( RP2D ) define Stage 1 administer additional subject select diagnosis , 15 subject per select diagnosis , evaluate safety PK profile , evidence anti tumor activity SAIT301 population . The tumor type include Stage 2 define protocol amendment time close study execution base information available time . The treatment period consist 21-day cycle . On Day 1 cycle , SAIT301 administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion . For dose level 1 , first subject receive IV infusion SAIT301 Cycle 1 Day 1 follow 21 day ( Cycle 1 ) . If first subject dose level 1 experience DLT Cycle 1 , 1 additional subject enrol receive dose level 1 , 50 % dose level 1 . If subject dose level -1 experience DLT Cycle 1 , 2 subject enrol dose level -1 . If first subject dose level 1 experience DLT Cycle 1 , second third subject receive SAIT301 dose level 1 follow 21 day ( Cycle 1 ) . At discretion SRC , first 3 subject dose level 1 experience DLT Cycle 1 , dose level 2 may administer next cohort . If one subject experience DLT , cohort expand evaluate described . For dose level 2 subsequent dose level , 3 subject receive SAIT301 Day 1 Cycle 1 follow 21 day ( Cycle 1 ) . If none 3 subject experience DLT , next dose level administer next cohort . If 1 first 3 subject experience DLT , 3 subject receive dose level . Dose escalation continue least 2 subject cohort 3 6 subject experience DLT ( i.e. , ≥33 % subject DLT dose level ) . Considering possibility relatively low efficacy , subject dose level 1 2 administer high dose level first administration . This individual dose escalation determine Investigators safety data higher dose level available . For Stage 1 2 , subject continue receive assign dose level SAIT301 unacceptable toxicity , document progression disease , another criterion discontinuation meet , 4 cycle complete . Subjects without evidence tumor progression 4 cycle may continue SAIT301 treatment evidence tumor progression 4 cycle ( Cycles 5 8 ) . Subjects without evidence tumor progression completion Cycle 8 eligible follow-on protocol . Subjects experience DLT discontinue treatment . At completion dose escalation stage , SRC may Stage 2 alter dose interval cycle base emerge PK data low SAIT301 dose level .</detailed_description>
