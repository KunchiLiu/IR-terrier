	<brief_summary>Approximately 50 % patient neuroendocrine cancer present metastasis , vast majority liver . In patient , one treatment option liver-directed therapy surgical resection . However , significant proportion patient eligible resection patient factor ( age , comorbidities ) tumor-related factor . There scant data utility EBRT ( external-beam radiotherapy ) SABR ( stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ) metastatic neuroendocrine tumor liver . This study measure effect concurrent everolimus external-beam radiotherapy liver metastatic neuroendocrine New method tumor assessment need NETs . Three new technique develop Sunnybrook Research Institute assess tumour response treatment : ( 1 ) contrast enhance ultrasound ; ( 2 ) perfusion CT ; ( 3 ) perfusion MRI . These method devise measure tumour perfusion blood flow response indicator measure cell death non-invasively . 1 . Concurrent everolimus give external-beam radiotherapy liver metastatic neuroendocrine tumor liver enhance efficacy radiotherapy add little , , toxicity 2 . New radiological measure CEUS DCE-CT effective measure delineate tumor response NETs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label , Single-Centre , Pilot Study Everolimus With EBRT Treatment mNET Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single-centre , pilot study Radiosensitization Everolimus external beam radiotherapy liver metastatic neuroendocrine tumor The study 2 safety run-in dose level : 2.5mg 5mg Everolimus PO daily . Two patient enrol 2.5mg dose level 2 patient enrol 5mg dose level . However , one patient start safety run-in dos time . For safety run-in dose level , serious adverse event related Everolimus occur within 30 day first dose radiation therapy ( combination Everolimus ) one patient , next patient start study drug . The criterion applies first 4 patient ( 2 patient 2.5mg PO daily 2 patient 5 mg PO daily ) . If serious adverse event related Everolimus occur fourth patient 5mg PO daily within 30 day first dose radiation therapy ( combination Everolimus ) , one patient enrol one time target dose 7.5mg PO daily . Ten patient enrol 7.5mg PO daily . For patient , Everolimus start 30 day prior radiation continue throughout radiation 14 day post radiation . Patients receive Everolimus 14 day post treatment ; pilot design ass combine effect radiation Everolimus . All patient receive external-beam radiotherapy ( 30Gy 10 fraction ) SBRT ( 60Gy 3-5 fraction give alternate weekday 1-2 week ) . The decision treat either external-beam radiotherapy SBRT base whether lesion amenable SBRT ( preferred treatment ) , determine size target lesion , liver spar organs-at-risk dose constraint . The prescription dose external-beam radiotherapy SBRT similarly determine factor .</detailed_description>
