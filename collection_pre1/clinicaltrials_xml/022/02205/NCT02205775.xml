	<detailed_description>Myocardial necrosis , assessed creatine kinase-MB ( CK-MB ) elevation , relatively frequent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , occur 40 % case . Although patient remain asymptomatic change cardiac function , even mild release CK-MB associate high mortality follow-up . A number treatment strategy propose limit myocardial damage PCI , procedural ischemic myocardial injury remain frequent complication coronary angioplasty . Several randomized study demonstrate beneficial effect therapy HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) patient already establish coronary artery disease normal subject hypercholesterolemia primary prevention , retrospective observational study suggest pre-treatment statin might reduce incidence myocardial infarction coronary intervention . This benefit confirm patient non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) undergo PCI , receive 80 mg atorvastatin 12 h PCI , 40-mg pre-procedure , compare placebo . The mechanisms underlying beneficial effect statins ischemic condition completely clear . Previous study suggest anti-inflammatory effect statin may play role , show benefit high patient high C-reactive protein . Since inflammatory status angioplasty , detect high level C-reactive protein , associate high risk peri-procedural myocardial necrosis adverse cardiac event follow-up , anti-inflammatory effect statin might contribute reduce myocardial necrosis , reduce microembolization occur coronary intervention . Statin administration also rapidly improve endothelial function . Thus , even short-term treatment statin ( unable provide LDL reduction persistent enough decrease atherosclerotic burden ) may important effect endothelial function inflammation . In patient undergo PCI , reduction peri-procedural myocardial injury pre-treatment statin parallel concomitant attenuation post-procedural increase intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) E-selectin plasma level , thus reinforce concept reduction endothelial inflammatory response may explain peri-procedural protective effect statin . Statins induce heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) expression vitro report pleiotropic benefit reduce oxidative stress vasculature various extravascular tissue Two anti-inflammatory cytokine , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) transform growth factor-beta , play critical role modulation immunoinflammatory cell infiltration atherosclerotic intima mechanism underlie protective effect IL-10 inflammatory cell infiltration involve heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) . Moreover , statins efficiently increase level endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , contribute vascular repair , patient coronary heart disease patient chronic heart failure , augment EPC proliferative capacity , way similar vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Therefore , study direct : 1. document whether immediate pre-procedural administration statin high dosage may reduce extent peri-procedural MI compare placebo background best current medical therapy ; 2. prove treatment rosuvastatin , hydrophilic statin , propose dosage , least comparable ( possibly superior ) atorvastatin propose dosage top standard treatment induce significant reduction peri-procedural damage previously document atorvastatin presence 1-week pre-treatment 40 mg/day ( 12 ) ; 3. characterize relevance HMG-CoA reductase inhibition ( vs largely HMGCoA reductase-independent cholesterol lower ) phenomenon ; 4. provide mechanistic explanation effect , investigate role 1 ) HO-1 2 ) EPCs context peri-PCI myocardial damage .</detailed_description>
