	<detailed_description>The objective protocol pilot innovative approach medication adherence determine approach improve inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) medication adherence , critical gap improve health child asthma . Acute asthma exacerbation occur yearly almost 60 % child asthma . They frequent reason childhood hospitalization expensive component pediatric asthma care U.S. Exacerbations impair quality life disproportionately affect African-American child , child Medicaid insurance , poor . Up 70 % exacerbation preventable guideline-recommended inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) medication adherence achieve . However , ICS medication adherence child persistent asthma dismal 11 - 18 % . Amongst child Medicaid insurance prescribe ICS , 63 % discontinue medication within 90 day . As healthcare system , investigator unable meaningfully improve ICS medication adherence cost-efficient way patient asthma , particularly high-risk , highest-potential population child moderate severe persistent asthma . These child suffer great morbidity mortality asthma yet highest-potential benefit improve ICS medication adherence . There urgent need efficacious adherence intervention population , without , child continue experience impaired health disproportionate morbidity . The investigator ' long-term objective identify disseminate intervention minimize occurrence severity exacerbation population . The overall objective pilot study test feasibility Smartphone-facilitated medication Notification Asthma Control Pediatric Patients ( SNAPP ) use wireless medication monitor ( WMM ) smartphone application provide parent reminder administration ICS medication , real-time feedback preventive controller medication adherence , wireless upload data secure online database . The central hypothesis child population , SNAPP result &gt; =25 % improved Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) score comparison usual management . Secondary hypothesis intervention result &gt; = 30 % decrease FeNO comparison usual care 6 month &gt; =40 % increase ICS medication adherence 6 month . The central hypothesis formulate basis report parent child acute exacerbation continue insufficient knowledge asthma self-management yet motivate best child . SNAPP incorporate monitoring , reminder , dynamic feedback smartphone improve ICS medication adherence influence child 's future independence chronic disease-management skill . Importantly , investigator use wireless medication monitor accurately objectively ascertain ICS medication adherence without patient effort . Parents facile use wireless technology organize daily activity communicate . Incorporating technology health care medication adherence logical next-step . The investigator propose test hypothesis follow Aim : To determine whether SNAPP meaningfully improve 6-month asthma control measure Asthma Control Test , airway inflammation measure use exhale nitric oxide ICS adherence compare usual care , RCT child moderate severe persistent asthma .</detailed_description>
