	<brief_summary>The Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) include severe neonatal hypotonia impair suckle leading failure thrive severe case , subsequently follow early onset morbid obesity hyperphagia deficit satiety , combine endocrine dysfunction probably due hypothalamic dysfunction . The pathophysiological mechanism occurrence 2 main nutritional phase PWS unknown . Swaab report deficit oxytocin ( OT ) -producing neuron paraventricular nucleus brain patient . In addition well-known anorexigenic effect , OT involve establish maintain social code . Moreover PWS mouse model generate MAGEL2 KO gene single OT injection 5 hr life prevent early death observe 50 % new born mouse recover normal suckling . Interestingly effect longer observe OT injection take place later . Our hypothesis early administration OT baby PWS may improve suckle possibly infant-mother interaction . In recent study ( manuscript preparation ) , show single intranasal administration OT well tolerate . This escalate dose study design evaluate tolerance repeat intranasal administration OT 3 step ( 4IU every day , 4 IU daily , 4IU twice daily ) baby younger 5 month PWS .</brief_summary>
