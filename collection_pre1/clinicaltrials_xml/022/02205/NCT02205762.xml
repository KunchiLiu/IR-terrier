	<brief_title>LCH-IV , International Collaborative Treatment Protocol Children Adolescents With Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The international effort past 20 year show combination therapy vinblastine prednisone effective therapy Multi-system ( MS ) -LCH . The previous prospective trial LCH-III confirm regimen standard regimen MS-LCH patient without risk organ involvement . It also show prolonged treatment latter group ( treatment duration 12 vs. 6 month ) superior prevent disease reactivations . The result trial encourage serve basis LCH-IV study design.Due complexity disease presentation outcomes , LCH-IV study seek tailor treatment base feature presentation response treatment , lead seven stratum : - Stratum I : First-line treatment MS-LCH patient ( Group 1 ) patient Single system ( SS ) -LCH multifocal bone `` Central Nervous System ( CNS ) -risk '' lesion ( Group 2 ) - Stratum II : Second-line treatment non-risk patient ( patient without risk organ involvement fail first-line therapy reactivation completion first-line therapy ) - Stratum III : Salvage treatment risk LCH ( patient dysfunction risk organ fail first-line therapy ) - Stratum IV : Stem cell transplantation risk LCH ( patient dysfunction risk organ fail first-line therapy ) - Stratum V : Monitoring treatment isolate tumorous neurodegenerative CNS-LCH - Stratum VI : Natural history management `` '' SS-LCH ( patient need systemic therapy time diagnosis ) - Stratum VII : Long-term Follow ( patient irrespective previous therapy follow reactivation permanent consequence complete disease resolution achieve respective protocol treatment complete )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stratum I Patients must less 18 year age time diagnosis . Patients must histological verification diagnosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis accord criterion describe Section 6.1 Signed inform consent form Stratum II Patients Stratum I : Progressive disease ( AD worse ) nonrisk organs 6 week ( Initial Course AD intermediate bad nonrisk organ AD good risk organ 12 week ( Initial Course 2 ) Disease progression ( AD worse ) nonrisk organ time continuation treatment Active disease end Stratum I treatment Disease reactivation nonrisk organ time completion Stratum I treatment Stratum III Patients Stratum I fulfill follow criterion : AD bad risk organ week 6 ( Initial Course 1 ) , AD bad AD intermediate risk organ week 12 ( Initial Course 2 ) . Presence unequivocally severe organ dysfunction mention evaluation point ( hematological dysfunction , liver dysfunction , ) Hb &lt; 70 g/L ( &lt; 7.0 g/dl ) and/or transfusion dependency PLT &lt; 20 x109/L ( 20,000/Î¼L ) and/or transfusion dependency ( criterion fulfil ) AND/OR Liver dysfunction ( digestive involvement protein loss ) Total protein &lt; 55 g/L substitution dependency Albumin &lt; 25 g/L substitution dependency ( least one two criterion fulfil ) Stratum IV Patients Stratum I Stratum III fulfill follow criterion : AD bad risk organ week 6 ( Initial Course 1 ) , AD bad AD intermediate risk organ week 12 ( Initial Course 2 ) Stratum I OR AD bad 2nd 3rd 2CdA/AraC course , AD bad AD intermediate 4th 2CdA/AraC course Stratum III AND Presence unequivocally severe organ dysfunction mention evaluation point ( hematological dysfunction , liver dysfunction , ) define Table XI ( see Section 10.3.1 ) . Informed consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient &lt; 18 year age ) must sign Ethics institutional Review Board approve consent form indicate awareness investigational nature risk study . When appropriate , young patient include discussion order obtain assent . Adequate organ function : Patients adequate hepatic , renal , cardiac pulmonary function undergo reduce intensity HCT base upon local institutional guideline , minimum meet requirement note eligibility checklist Appendix AVIII_1 . However , significant hepatic pulmonary dysfunction , secondary underlie LCH disease activity , exclude patient protocol enrollment discuss National PI Coordinator Coordinating Principal Investigator . Stratum V All patient verify diagnosis LCH MRI finding consistent NDCNSLCH irrespective previous treatment ( also register Strata ofLCHIV ) . Patients isolate tumorous CNSLCH ( include isolate DI mass lesion hypothalamuspituitary axis ) . In patient already establish diagnosis LCH radiologic find CNS lesion compatible LCH , biopsy lesion obligatory . In case biopsy lesion need inclusion study Stratum VI Patients newly diagnose SSLCH localization `` multifocal bone '' , isolate tumorous CNS lesion , isolate `` CNSrisk '' lesion . Stratum VII All patient register LCH IV ( regardless treatment ) long consent longterm followup withheld . Stratum I Pregnancy ( patient childbearing age must appropriately test chemotherapy ) LCHrelated permanent consequence ( e.g . vertebra plana , sclerosing cholangitis , lung fibrosis , etc . ) absence active disease Prior systemic therapy Stratum II Patients progressive disease risk organs Permanent consequence ( e.g . sclerosing cholangitis , lung fibrosis , etc . ) without evidence active LCH organ location No write consent patient his/her parent legal guardian Stratum III The presence follow criterion exclude patient study : Isolated sclerosing cholangitis without evidence active hepatic LCH evidence risk organ involvement . Inadequate renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 3x normal age Stratum IV Pulmonary failure ( require mechanical ventilation ) due active LCH . Isolated liver sclerosis pulmonary fibrosis , without active LCH . Uncontrolled active lifethreatening infection . Decreased renal function GFR le 50ml/1.73m2/min . Pregnancy active breast feeding Failure provide sign informed consent Stratum VI Patients SSLCH isolate tumorous CNS lesion ( eligible Stratum V ) , Patients isolate `` CNSrisk '' multifocal bone lesion ( eligible Stratum I , Group 2 )</criteria>
