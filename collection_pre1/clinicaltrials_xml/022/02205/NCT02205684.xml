	<brief_summary>Physical health problem common schizophrenia two- three-fold increase morbidity mortality rate , result 20 year reduction life expectancy . A genetic vulnerability develop cardiovascular disease document patient , many lifestyle factor also negatively influence physical health . Patients schizophrenia likely smoke , physically inactive overweight , suffer malnutrition due unhealthy diet , reduce cardiorespiratory fitness . Moreover , patient increase risk develop diabetes mellitus type II metabolic syndrome . These aspect demonstrate need multi-disciplinary treatment patient schizophrenia underline need address physical health . Poor physical fitness seem associate exacerbated negative symptom increase cognitive dysfunction patient schizophrenia . However , evidence physical activity consequence schizophrenia scarce . In randomized controlled trial investigate effect high intensity training outpatient schizophrenia psychotic symptom well-being , cognition cortical structure , tobacco smoking substance use , addition metabolic index .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Outpatients treatment recruit randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The patient randomize either Computer game Skills Group ( CSG ) physical Exercise Group ( EG ) . The group identically organize two location . The intervention last 12 week , treatment usual continue patient . Patients assess enter study ( randomization allocation one clinical group ) , well post-treatment 4 month post-treatment . Thus , plan study prospective longitudinal design . It single blind sense assessment psychiatric symptom level neurocognitive function perform research staff blind group membership . The physiological testing perform staff involve training blind . EG participant perform aerobic high intensity training ( HIT ) consist supervise walking/running treadmill 2 time week 12 week . Each session follow structure ; eight-minute warm-up , follow four time four minute interval 85-95 % maximum heart rate , active pause three minute walk 70 % maximum heart rate . The exercise session end five minute cool-down period . HIT perform 4 x 4 interval proven feasible safe among patient schizophrenia clinical population . Participants CSG take part session clinic play computer game ( Nintendo Wii Sports ) . The time spent activity clinic group . When absent schedule physical exercise/playing computer game subject offer participate following day . If absent whole week , train period/computer game play period prolong accordingly . In randomized controlled trial investigate effect HIT outpatient schizophrenia symptom well-being , cognition brain structure , smoke habit substance use , well metabolic index . The participate outpatient clinic catchment area base cover population 200 000 person 250 patient diagnostic group treatment one time .</detailed_description>
