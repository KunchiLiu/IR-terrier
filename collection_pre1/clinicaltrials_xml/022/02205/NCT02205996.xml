	<brief_title>The Effects Hypoglycaemia People With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Although United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) follow-up data suggest reduced macrovascular complication tight glycaemic control , recent study people type 2 diabetes fail replicate finding . Furthermore , all-cause mortality find increase strict glycaemic control Action Control Cardiovascular Risk Diabetes ( ACCORD ) study . The cause increase death remain unclear . Strict glycaemic control associate increase risk hypoglycaemia . Although , hypoglycaemia traditionally consider complication treatment type 1 diabetes , recently recognise problem people type 2 diabetes particularly insulin therapy . In ACCORD study , risk death significantly increase one episode severe hypoglycaemia strict standard study treatment arm . As plasma glucose fall 4.0 mmol/L , series defence mechanism occur , individualised glycaemic threshold , reverse hypoglycaemia include rise catecholamine level . This may lead hypokalaemia , prolong QT interval , cardiac arrhythmia . It may also lead impaired cardiovascular autonomic function 16 hour afterwards ; increase inflammatory marker ; platelet activation promote vascular damage . As majority study assess effect hypoglycaemia cardiovascular risk marker conduct people type 1 diabetes healthy control , finding may necessarily applicable people type 2 diabetes . In particular , effect hypoglycaemia platelet function thrombotic risk people type 2 diabetes require clarification . In study , hypothesise acute hypoglycaemia result platelet activation people type 2 diabetes higher degree control .</detailed_description>
