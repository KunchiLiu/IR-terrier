	<detailed_description>Cementum component periodontium , major role serve site attachment principal collagen fiber ( Sharpey ' fiber ) . In particular , cementum , virtue structural dynamic quality , provide tooth attachment maintenance occlusal relationship jaw . Its multiple function fulfil biological activity reactivity cementoblasts , deposit two collagen-containing variety cementum completely different property . Periodontal disease local inflammation support tissue teeth , cause destruction gingival tissue , bone loss loss connective tissue attachment cementum . Since relationship local bacteria periodontal disease prove widely recognise , generally accept removal pathogenic microorganism form plaque calculus major goal periodontal treatment . This therapy currently consist scale root planing , addition mechanical instrumentation , regeneration restoration various periodontal component original form , function consistency perform . Previously accept bacterial endotoxin bacteria penetrate cementum periodontally diseased root surface . Therefore , besides removal subgingival plaque calculus deposit , removal cementum one primary endpoint periodontal healing . The goal periodontal therapy attain plan root surface smooth hard surface characteristic free endotoxin cementum tooth prior eruption . While study report endotoxin locate within cementum accept removal 'diseased ' cementum necessary successful periodontal treatment . Saygin et al . report cementum site soft-tissue attachment re-established , cementum matrix rich source many growth factor influence activity various periodontal cell type Grzesik et al . state cementum play regulatory role periodontal regeneration . From study conclude non-aggressive periodontal treatment necessary optimal periodontal health well periodontal regeneration . During periodontal therapy subgingival instrumentation mean removal root cementum eventually lead exposure dentinal tubule , pulp injury dentin hypersensitivity . The vitro study include establish vitro experimental model standardize experimental condition evaluate amount cementum various instrument force combination . Several study , show effect different instrument root surface , emphasize periodontal treatment perform less aggressively respect removal cementum . Previously report teeth treat HC US present surface without cementum open dentinal tubules.They report root surface treat US show scaly rough topography whether teeth treat HC present smooth surface . Kawashima co-worker compare two different piezoelectric US ( VectorTM EnacR scaler ) HC find US group significantly remain cementum HC group . However observed area thin absent cementum HC group . Ruhling et al . compare effect piezoelectric US , sonic scaler ( SS ) , sonic scaler insert coat Teflon tube , Periotor insert HC . They show HC SS group present great removal root cementum nearly cementum remove 25 % sample treat HC . Tomasi et al . report biofilm calculus certainly remove also question requirement removal contaminate root cementum root planing . US new shape tip AP device alternative HC design subgingival access develop minimal root damage . In recent year , newly develop instrument present clinically efficient result treatment chronic periodontitis . Subgingival AP suggest treatment modality root debridement . Two recent study investigate clinical microbiological efficacy subgingival AP glycine powder periodontal pocket reveal probe depth reduction removal subgingival biofilm . Today scientific research evidence show loss root substance surface roughness subgingival AP US instrumentation AP . The aim present study compare effect vivo root instrumentation use new piezoelectric US instrument , HC air polish glycine powder , routine clinical condition , thickness surface characteristic cementum . Forty-eight periodontally involved caries free , single root teeth advance periodontitis schedule extraction treat four different method . The teeth instrument subgingivally one approximal site either hand curette ( HC ) , piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler ( US ) , piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler follow air polish , air polish ( AP ) alone . Upon extract teeth , instrument non-instrumented site analyze dissect microscope SEM measurement amount surface characteristic residual cementum .</detailed_description>
