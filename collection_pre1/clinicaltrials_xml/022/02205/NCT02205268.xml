	<brief_summary>Background Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) one frequently diagnose behavioural disorder childhood require treatment ( 3-5 % child ) . It important health problem impair social , educational occupational performance , increase risk psychiatric disorder include anxiety , depression substance misuse . There cure ADHD standard stimulant medication treatment best symptomatic . Moreover , stimulant side effect parent often concerned long-term effect . A number non-drug treatment develop target brain directly . Neurofeedback Training ( NTx ) new , non-drug treatment target brain directly potentially enhance control attention ADHD . NTx could valuable alternative and/or adjunct standard care . Aims Although NTx gain popularity Europe US , rigorous study require support implementation NHS . We therefore propose pilot study establish tolerabilty safety , develop treatment protocol collect data design follow-on control NTx trial ADHD . Methods We plan open label , single arm , treatment trial near infrared spectroscopy neurofeedback training frontal lobe activation school-aged child ADHD . 48 participant recruit 1 year offer 20 NTx session 10 week . Participants recruit Mental Health Services . Primary outcomes safety tolerability secondary outcome include standard clinical behavioural rating scale Test Of Variables Attention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ADHD one frequently diagnose condition childhood least half patient symptom persist adulthood . It important seek effective treatment ADHD child ADHD often reach full potential increase risk psychiatric difficulty childhood , adolescence adulthood , include disorder mood , anxiety , conduct substance misuse . Increasingly available evidence suggest ADHD may result abnormal level certain chemical alter brain function . Standard treatment stimulant medication aim chemical imbalance whilst may help child , limited benefit others benefit quarter child . Parents often reluctant consider medication due concern side effect unknown long term effect drug child 's develop brain body . Non- drug treatment provide alternative and/or adjunct may overcome concern long-term side effect drug . Furthermore , late guideline National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE , 2008 ) recommend medication use first-line treatment severe case ADHD . In case advised child receive group treatment programme parent carers receive parent training education ADHD . Whilst guideline welcome promote alternative medication treat ADHD , concern raise feasibility efficacy recommend group intervention child individual treatment may easier implement effective child . Therefore , although number treatment ADHD , limitation term efficacy , tolerability , side effect practicability . There therefore clear rational investigate new treatment may superior efficacy valuable additional alternative treatment . Several individual , non-drug intervention ADHD emerge last thirty year . These include home parental guidance , classroom base teacher intervention , behavioural therapy , herbal treatment nutritional supplement . Neurofeedback training appear one promising technique directly target brain function key area . Neurofeedback training ( NTx ) use signal directly brain make subject aware brain function . It establish treatment epilepsy , migraine stroke rehabilitation . Abnormal brain function ( electrical blood flow ) consistently demonstrate ADHD may therefore targeted neurofeedback . These finding form basis consider NTx potential alternative medication treatment ADHD . Compelling evidence recent control study indicate NTx use electric brain signal ( EEG ) useful treatment ADHD effect last least 6 month . Near infrared spectroscopy neurofeedback ( NIRS ) neurofeedback training ( NIRS NTx ) newer alternative EEG NTx . It easy administer may require few treatment session . NIRS determine change brain activity measure change amount oxygen brain . Rather require subject alter pattern electrical brain activity , NIRSNTx train subject alter blood flow specific brain area . Abnormal brain blood flow demonstrate ADHD typically , abnormality include reduce activity brain area behind forehead . NIRS NTx low cost technique apply home , clinic school . NIRS safely apply head low energy light use technique cause damage underlie tissue less 5 % exposure occur ordinary midday sunlight . NIRSNTx perform use laptop computer , spectroscope , sensor headband headphone . Typically , patient watch film computer screen whilst wear sensor headband headphone . The headband apply two light source ( red infrared ) sensor skin overlie brain area interest . No special preparation skin necessary . The light shine skin skull brain , absorbed different quantity depend amount oxygen carry blood . Some light absorbed reflect back sensor . This signal analyse spectroscope data send computer interpret software generate feedback . Increased blood flow result positive reinforcement ( film clip advance ) reduce blood flow result negative reinforcement ( film clip stop monotone auditory signal heard ) . Subjects learn spontaneously increase blood flow brain region interest enjoy uninterrupted view film clip . Consequently , NIRS provide realtime biofeedback subject regard blood flow specific brain area . A typical session NIRS NTx involve 10 minute train two brain site . In view know haemodynamic change ADHD functional neuroanatomy attentional control , site would right leave prefrontal area . Treatment session offer twice weekly 15 48 session . There publish tolerability data , available report come personal communication clinician . The side effect report mild headache short live self-limiting , immediately train day follow , around 10 % patient . Clinical observation suggest predicts good response NTx . Neurofeedback treatment mechanism The human brain lifelong capacity adapt change reorganise . This ability call plasticity partly work change bloodflow . Examples plasticity adult include find brain activation lead brain growth , rewire neuron follow stroke , large brain area dedicate move finger musician , enlargement certain brain area London cab driver . NIRSNTx may act part enhance brain 's capacity plasticity . In summary , available evidence suggest NIRS NTx appear safe capable target specific brain area show reduced activity ADHD .</detailed_description>
