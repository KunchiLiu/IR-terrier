Step 2 : Selection development intervention create PD MF strategy expert 's roundtable discussion , use knowledge gain step 1 literature search effect strategy implement PCRPs . Step 3 : Test compare strategy cluster CBA ( effectiveness , process evaluation cost ) , data extraction exist registration system , questionnaires interview . For effectiveness cost-effectiveness , n = 500 patient , 50 per hospital . For process evaluation , n=50 patient , 5 per hospital , n = 40 healthcare professional , 4 per hospital .</detailed_description>
