	<brief_title>A Phase III Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Intravenous Infusion Nemonoxacin Treating CAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) remain leading cause death develop developed country . In choice antibacterial agent use treat CAP , fluoroquinolones receive considerable attention wide spectrum bactericidal activity . TG-873870 ( Nemonoxacin ) , non-fluorinated quinolone ( NFQ ) , selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor . This study evaluate clinical efficacy , microbiological efficacy safety Intravenous nemonoxacin compare Intravenous levofloxacin adult patient community-acquired pneumonia . Besides , populationpharmacokinetics ( PPK ) nemonoxacin adult patient CAP continuous IV Infusion pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) determine .</detailed_description>
