	<brief_summary>Epilepsy , condition individual prone recurrent epileptic seizure , common chronic neurological disorder child . Epilepsy onset common first two year life associate poor prognosis seizure control neurodevelopmental outcome . The ketogenic diet ( KD ) medically supervise diet high fat restrict carbohydrate protein . KD therapy show effective treatment seizures child epilepsy old two . Associated benefit include : reduced requirement routine emergency antiepileptic drug ( AED ) few seizure relate hospital admission . Although report suggest KD therapy improve seizure young child high quality trial data demonstrate effectiveness safety age group . The KD resource intensive , require dietetic physician time ; data require justify expansion service cater apparent need . The investigator therefore propose prospective multicentre randomise trial investigate effectiveness safety KD child epilepsy age 2 , fail respond two AEDs . Children randomly assign either receive KD AEDs . The allocated treatment start 2week baseline period , 's effectiveness assess 8 week . Seizure diary use record seizures related event , questionnaire use ass diet tolerance ; also growth blood biochemistry monitor . The information obtain study necessary optimise choice epilepsy treatment , aim improve outcome thus determine whether KD use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet Infants With Epilepsy ( KIWE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project propose randomise control multicentre study infant epilepsy fail respond two pharmacological treatment ( antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) corticosteroid ) , compare ketogenic diet treatment AED . Children study recruit 8 paediatric neurology centre South England establish KD service child epilepsy . The collaborate paediatric neurologist base centre name co-applicants proposal . All child age 3 24 month consider diagnosis epilepsy , namely continue seizure despite trial 2 AEDs ( include corticosteroid ) experience least 8 seizure week . Children exclude show : metabolic disease contradict use KD ; progressive neurological disease ; severe gastrooesophageal reflux undergone previous fail trial KD . In addition , family able attend clinic require timeline . KD meal plan accurately calculate child individually dietitian consideration daily calorie requirement , fat carbohydrate ratio ( 3:1 4:1 ) , adequate protein intake vitamin mineral supplementation . Ongoing adjustment diet dietitian determine weight gain degree ketosis . 1 . Baseline assessment : Written consent obtain eligible child . Full history include seizure type , neurological examination , weight , length head circumference document . Randomisation KD standard AED group carry support UCL PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit ( CTU ) . Investigations perform KD group ( clinically indicate AED group ) include FBC , U &amp; Es , Glucose , LFTs , Calcium , Magnesium , Phosphate , Zinc , Selenium , Acylcarnitine profile , Cholesterol , Triglycerides , Urate , 25 hydroxy Vitamin D , urine calcium/creatinine , urine organic acid . An EEG perform clinically indicate . 2 . Observation period 2 week : No change regular AEDs . Emergency seizure treatment continue require ( acute treatment benzodiazepine ) . The following data record standardized diary ( data continue record throughout intervention period 8 week ) : seizure type , seizure frequency , number emergency seizure treatment require , contact NHS due seizure exacerbation ( hospital admission number day , A &amp; E GP attendance ) 3 . Start classical KD AED . The classical KD administer per protocol treating service . The recording seizure type frequency continue . 4 . Second Assessment ( 4 week start treatment period , patient ) : clinical review include weight ; documentation seizure frequency , tolerability diet randomise KD group questionnaire . 5 . Third/final assessment ( 8 week start treatment/all patient ) . Clinical review include neurological examination , weight , length head circumference . Documentation seizure outcome ( seizure diary ) . KD group : completion tolerability questionnaire , blood investigation ( FBC , U &amp; Es , Glucose , LFTs , plasma bicarbonate , calcium , magnesium , phosphate , zinc , selenium , acylcarnitine profile , cholesterol , triglyceride , urate , nonesterified fatty acid , blood ketone ) urine calcium/creatinine ratio . EEG perform clinically indicate . Dependent seizure response , KD ( diet group ) AED ( standard AED group ) continue change . Those AED group fail offer KD outside context trial . It would anticipate clinical data would collect patient 12 month determine retention rate . Exit criterion : Children withdraw treatment prior 8 week q &gt; 50 % increase seizure frequency baseline , intolerable side effect resolve manipulation KD medication . A safety monitoring committee convene .</detailed_description>
