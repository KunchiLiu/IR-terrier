	<criteria>Subject willing sign date study Patient Informed Consent Form . Subject indicate CRT device accord local guideline . Sinus Rhythm time enrollment Complete Left Bundle Branch Block ( LBBB ) document ECG ( within 30 day prior enrollment ) . Strauss Criteria use LBBB . Intrinsic , normal AV conduction document ECG PR interval less equal 200ms ( within 30 day prior enrollment ) . Left ventricular ejection fraction less equal 35 % ( document within 180 day prior enrollment ) . NYHA class II , III IV ( document within 30 day prior enrollment ) despite optimal medical therapy .
