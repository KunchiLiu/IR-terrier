	<brief_summary>African Americans suffer disproportionately high risk diabetes compare Americans . Reasons race disparity diabetes incidence completely understood . Although difference prevalence obesity explain significant portion racial disparity diabetes risk , explain disparity . Strategies control diabetes epidemic reduce racial disparity often overlook preventive measure . Currently , powerful know strategy prevent diabetes weight loss overweight/obese . However , weight loss often difficult achieve maintain , opportunity prevent diabetes identify , particularly African Americans . Among potential novel opportunity correction low low-normal potassium level ( hypokalemia ) . In secondary analysis , find low-normal potassium ( K ) novel risk factor diabetes ; find association low-K diabetes risk may stronger African Americans compare white . Therefore , previously unrecognized alternative adjunct strategy prevent diabetes , particularly African Americans , may involve correction low low-normal K level ( hypokalemia ) . Large-scale , adequately-powered , randomize control trial need establish effectiveness approach . However , prior trial , pathophysiology association low K poor glucose metabolism must understand . This pilot clinical trial begin determine effect K supplementation measure glucose metabolism African Americans . In pilot clinical trial , 30 African Americans prediabetes low-normal serum K ( &lt; 4.0 mEq/L ) randomize K-supplements , 20mEq ( 2-10mEq tablet ) twice daily match placebo capsule twice daily . Prior randomization , baseline measure take include measure glucose metabolism 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , baseline chemistry baseline 24-hour urinary potassium measurement . Patients take intervention daily undergo repeat test measure end 3 month period . The primary endpoint change glucose tolerance , measure change glucose area-under-the-curve ( AUC ) 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Secondary endpoint include change fast , 1-hour , 2-hour post-challenge glucose level , well measurement insulin secretion insulin sensitivity measure oral glucose minimal model method . ( 1 ) The baseline data trial allow u quantify abnormality glucose metabolism African Americans prediabetes/early diabetes low-normal serum K. The post-intervention data provide estimate impact K-supplements compare supplement abnormality . Data derive pilot study use design large scale , adequately power clinical trial . This trial also help ass feasibility recruit target population . With pilot trial , begin determine whether K-supplements , inexpensive , well-tolerated , simple intervention , could help reduce diabetes risk among African Americans . ON 1/31/2016 stop consenting/enrolling subject . We consent total 61 subject 29 screen 32 screen .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To eligible inclusion study follow enrollment criterion must meet : 1 . Participants must 30 year age old . 2 . They must diagnosis prediabetes define hemoglobin A1c 5.76.5 % measure initial screen visit . 3 . They must serum K+ 3.34.0 mEq/L 2 occasion , within 18 month period , include initial screening visit . If subject outsdie range inclusion , PI may offer subject option repeat screen serum K+ measurement . 4 . The participant must willing capable provide write informed consent . 5 . The participant must available followup must minimum telephone access . 6 . Participants must able readn/understand English . Participants must follow : 1 . Participants must evidence chronic kidney disease estimate GFR &lt; 60ml/min . All patient screen eGFR enrollment visit . 2 . Participants must evidence diabetes mellitus require treatment medication prior screen visit . The random postchallenge glucose ≥ 200mg/dl ( prior lab ) , A1c level ≥ 6.5 % ( prior lab ) , prior physician diagnosis , use antidiabetic medication . If participant glucose level diabetic range screen visit , eligible continue study long glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dl . 3 . Participants must history endoscopyverified peptic ulcer disease past history either gastric duodenal ulcer . 4 . Participants must evidence cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina cardiac event within 6 month , congestive heart failure , condition might impact followup , base discretion principal investigator . 5 . Participants must pregnant intend get pregnant study period . The study intervention safe pregnant woman , serum pregnancy screen indicate ; however , pregnant woman exclude pregnancy affect glucose homeostasis , bias primary outcome measurement damage scientific validity study .</criteria>
