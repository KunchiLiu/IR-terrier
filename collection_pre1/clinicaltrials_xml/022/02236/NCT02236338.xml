	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation v Laser Ablation Incompetent Greater Saphenous Vein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) estimate affect 25 million Americans . This condition lead varicose vein , ache , fatigue , swell , ulceration , bleed low extremity . The common cause refluxing incompetent Greater Saphenous Vein ( GSV ) . This condition result pool deoxygenated blood low extremity rather successful transport blood back heart lung . The historical treatment surgically remove 'strip ' GSV blood rerouted healthy deep vein . A less invasive treatment option , Endovenous Thermal Ablation , emerge last decade virtually replace strip . This involve advance catheter ultrasound guidance GSV advance laser fiber radiofrequency probe catheter . These device produce energy destroy vein catheter slowly pull back . While radiofrequency ablation laser ablation accept treatment , neither technology definitively prove few complication superior result . This part practice ability make head head comparison two technology must choose one secondary financial constraint . The aim study perform randomize prospective trial compare two modality definitive information evaluate complication outcome obtain recommendation , either , technology superior make .</detailed_description>
