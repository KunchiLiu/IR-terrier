	<brief_summary>The overall aim project monitor everyday life activity child neurological disorder undergo rehabilitation use wearable sensor capable accurate unobtrusive long-term measurement . Specific objective : 1 . To adapt sensor use child neurological disorder . The focus lie exact position investigation need amount IMUs . 2 . To validate sensor data collect video recording develop specific algorithm automatically extract specific movement analyze long-term sensor recording . 3 . To perform cross-sectional study ass intensity , task-specificity duration upper low limb activity rehabilitation . There , aim gain objective information level type activity rehabilitation relation age , gender disorder . 4 . To conduct responsiveness study ass whether sensor output able highlight change time rehabilitation . Therefore , time point T=0 ( shortly admission center ) , participant equip 3 inertial measurement unit ( 1 wrist 1 sternum ) . Additionally , small wearable camera mount chest . The participant return everyday life 4 hour ( therapy , measurement period even ) . Afterwards , equipment remove . To investigate responsiveness , protocol repeat 4 week later ( time point T=1 ) .</brief_summary>
