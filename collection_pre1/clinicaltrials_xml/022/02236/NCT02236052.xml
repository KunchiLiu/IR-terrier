	<detailed_description>This study use cohort stagger ( slow enrollment ) 3 non-adjuvanted dose level ( low , medium , high dose level VLP per strain ) , 2 adjuvanted dose level ( low high dose level VLP per strain ) placebo-controlled group divide 3 cohort : - Cohort 1 : Approximately one hundred thirty-eight ( 138 ) subject randomize dosed follow : seventy-five ( 75 ) subject low non-adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) subject medium non-adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) subject low adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine twenty-five ( 25 ) subject placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect clinical staff review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The DSMB consist PIs , Sponsor 's Medical Officer 3 external medical advisor ( vote member ) ; member determine clinical site allow continue immunization second cohort . - Cohort 2 : Approximately one hundred seventy-five ( 175 ) subject randomize dosed follow : fifty-six ( 56 ) subject medium non-adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , fifty-six ( 56 ) subject low adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) subject high adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) subject high non-adjuvanted dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine twenty-five ( 25 ) subject placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect clinical staff review DSMB prior allow immunization third cohort . - Cohort 3 : Approximately one hundred thirty-seven ( 137 ) subject randomize dosed follow : fifty-six ( 56 ) subject high adjuvanted dose , fifty-six ( 56 ) subject high non-adjuvanted dose twenty-five ( 25 ) subject placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female subject , 50 year age old . 2 . BMI ≥18 ≤32 . 3 . Give his/her consent participate study ( sign inform consent form ) . In opinion Investigator , competence willingness provide write , informed consent participation reading inform consent form . The subject must adequate opportunity discus study Investigator qualify designee . 4 . Healthy judge Investigator designee determine general physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , medical history conduct 90 day prior study vaccine administration . Subjects preexist chronic disease allow participate disease stable , accord Investigator 's judgment , condition unlikely confound result study pose additional risk subject participate study . Stable disease define new onset exacerbation preexist chronic disease 6 month prior immunization . Based Investigator 's judgment , subject recent stabilisation disease may still eligible . 5 .

According Investigator 's opinion , presence significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical neuropsychiatric illness . `` Uncontrolled '' define : 1 . Requiring new medical surgical treatment within one month prior study vaccine administration would interfere vaccine evaluation study completion ( subject require medical surgical treatment would interfere evaluation [ e.g. , minor knee surgery , cataract , etc . ] would eligible ) ; 2 . Requiring change medication dosage one month prior study vaccine administration due uncontrolled symptom drug toxicity ( elective dosage adjustment stable subject acceptable ) . 2 . Any medical neuropsychiatric condition history excessive alcohol use drug abuse , Investigator 's opinion , would render subject unable provide inform consent unable provide valid safety observation report . 3 . Any autoimmune disease confirm suspected immunosuppressive condition immunodeficiency include history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , Hepatitis B C , presence lymphoproliferative disease . 4 .
