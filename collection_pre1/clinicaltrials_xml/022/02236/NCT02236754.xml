	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) develop impaired insulin production due loss insulin produce cell ( beta cell ) . The amount insulin produce imperfectly correlate beta cell mass ( BCM ) . The development reliable method noninvasively quantify total amount insulin produce beta cell would great benefit provide important endpoint development new treatment diabetes . The investigator previously identify specific marker islet cell call vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( VMAT2 ) investigator propose use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan determine islet beta cell mass . The PET radiopharmaceutical 18F-fluoropropyl ( FP ) -dihydrotetrabenazine ( DTBZ ) use previously human subject without adverse effect . It show promise differentiate type 1 diabetes non-diabetes . The investigator hypothesize repeat PET scan reproducible subject . Subjects normal BCM recruit among normal weight non-diabetic people plasma insulin level within normal range . Subjects predict reduced BCM recruit among patient T1DM low non-measurable insulin level . Two PET scan measurement take subject amount VMAT2 pancreas compare reproducible finding . Biochemical test also perform compare PET scan potential indirect marker beta cell mass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes result insulin secretory capacity beta cell population lose severely compromised.Plasma insulin level use surrogate marker beta cell mass ( BCM ) insulin level often correlate well . A `` gold standard measurement '' obtain BCM would great value . The aim propose study evaluate islet image technique use PET scan directly measure BCM thus provide valuable information monitoring disease progress response therapy people diabetes people high risk diabetes . Type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) occur beta cell selectively destroy T cell mediate autoimmune process . People high risk develop T1DM , first degree relative patient T1DM , sometimes identified disease develop measure autoantibody beta cell , however test neither sensitive specific . Little known natural history BCM , turnover cell lifetime , course inflammation diabetes . This principally pancreas highly heterogeneous organ difficult biopsy without significant complication , BCM comprise 1 2 % total volume . Accurate assessment BCM human diabetes limited autopsy study , usually suffer inadequate clinical information ; thus , development non-invasive mean BCM measurement could important interventional therapy T1DM , islet regeneration/stem cell therapy islet transplantation .</detailed_description>
