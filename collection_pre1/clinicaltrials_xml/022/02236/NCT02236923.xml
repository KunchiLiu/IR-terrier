	<brief_title>Study Influence Moon Seasons On Outcomes Following Surgery To Repair Ascending Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine whether finding Shuhaiber et al . [ 2013 ] ( see citation ) may confirm use national audit data United Kingdom . A cohort acute ascend aortic dissection repair surgery extract National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit ( NACSA ) database . The current dataset version 4.12 , available download website National Institute Cardiovascular Outcomes Research ( see link ) , contain 168 field detail pre-operative patient characteristic , operative detail post-operative outcome . The dataset revise intermittently meet requirement user respond change management adult cardiac surgery ; however , field analyse study subject document revision . The extracted data clean use version 9.9 NACSA cleaning algorithm . Seasons cod way publish study : autumn ( September 21 December 20 ) , winter ( December 21 March 21 ) , spring ( March 22 June 21 ) summer ( June 22 September 20 ) . Three definition use phase moon . The first definition mirror employ motivate work : lunar cycle new moon new moon split four part label `` New '' , `` Waxing '' , `` Full '' `` Waning '' . The second definition center four label around name event : i.e. , `` New '' period center around new moon event , instead start day new moon first definition . The third definition split lunar cycle 8 event-centred period , call `` New '' , `` Waxing crescent '' , `` First quarter '' , `` Waxing gibbous '' , `` Full '' , `` Waning gibbous '' , `` Last quarter '' `` Waning crescent '' . There need explore individual univariate relationship predictor outcomes work , give limit purpose confirm earlier multivariate finding . The relationship environmental factor ( season lunar cycle ) in-hospital mortality examine use multivariate logistic regression , control demographic mortality risk factor . The specific variable include common earlier work age , sex , hypertension , diabetes , renal failure , indicator weekend admission . The national audit include information dyslipidaemia , felt exclusion model effect comparability work earlier study none earlier publish model show effect dyslipidaemia surgical outcome . The relationship environmental factor Length stay ( LOS ) survivor examine use multivariate linear regression include risk factor mortality model . As publish study , LOS transform natural logarithmic scale prior analysis . We run analysis without European system cardiac operative risk evaluation score ( EuroSCORE ) II risk adjustment . The EuroSCORE II develop specifically adjust risk in-hospital mortality . It employ despite absence publish model ensure risk adjustment prior estimation contribution environmental factor thorough reasonably possible . All analysis perform use R version 3.1.0 . Environmental factor calculate use lunar package available CRAN software repository .</detailed_description>
