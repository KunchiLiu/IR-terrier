	<brief_title>Healthy Effects Innovative Probiotic Pasta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological evidence indicate consumption whole grain product associate decreased risk common chronic disease , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obesity , hypertension metabolic syndrome . In present study whole grain pasta supplement prebiotics probiotic 'ad hoc ' formulate . In detail , pasta industrially developed identification particular cultivar wheat barley , rich carotenoid , β-glucans ( 2.6 g/100g pasta ) , soluble fiber antioxidant . Further , pasta supplement spore Bacillus coagulans , putative probiotic microorganism , belong Lactobacillus family . It well demonstrate ability microorganism survive technological process upper gastro-intesinal tract , order exert beneficial effect low gut , anti-microbial activity , increase immunological defence well improvement intestinal regularity . Conversely , control pasta make cultivar grain technological process , without supplementation . In parallel randomize control one arm trial , 40 healthy volunteer randomly allocate consumption two kind pasta day , 12 week . At begin study every 4 week , subject ask provide blood , urine feces evaluation : - blood inflammation marker ; - blood lipid carbohydrate profile ; - blood urine marker cardiovascular risk ; - feces profile microbiota detection marker healthiness gut . In addition , volunteer fill different questionnaire regard dietary habit , physical activity gut healthiness .</detailed_description>
