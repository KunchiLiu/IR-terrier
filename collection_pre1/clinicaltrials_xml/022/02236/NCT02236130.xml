	<brief_summary>Context : Single shoot peripheral nerve block limit duration action depend local anesthetic agent use block . But rarely last long 12 hr . Patients need oral analgesic home block wear control pain . Objectives : Primary Objective To determine peripheral nerve block advantage term decrease oral analgesic requirement post operative period even effect block worn Secondary Objective To determine inclusion single shot regional technique improve patient/family satisfaction post operative pain management . Study Design : Prospective randomize single blind study . Inclusion Criteria - Children age 6 yr 17yr schedule ambulatory peripheral orthopedic surgery moderate severe postoperative pain . - Surgery moderate duration ( &lt; 2hr ) - Surgery associate minimal blood loss fluid shift ( &lt; 10 % total blood volume ) - American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification 1 2 - Parents able understand follow instruction able reach home phone Exclusion Criteria - Known allergy local anesthetic - Preexisting neuropathy sensory motor deficit - Skin infection site needle placement - Parents refusal peripheral nerve block</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>80 child age 6yr 17 yr . schedule ambulatory peripheral orthopedic procedure operate room Batson Children 's Hospital enrol study . Written inform consent obtain parent legal guardian assent obtain patient possible . Once enrolled study , patient randomly assign one two group General anesthesia ( GA group ) General Anesthesia combine regional anesthesia ( RA group ) . Once patient bring operate room standard ASA monitor apply . After mask induction O2/Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) /Sevoflurane ( Sevo ) , peripheral intravenous line insert secure . Additional IV medication propofol 2-3mg/kg give prior insertion appropriate size laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) . Patients GA group undergo procedure general anesthesia Sevo/O2 . Patients RA group receive peripheral nerve block appropriate procedure induction general anesthesia O2/N2O/Sevo . The attend anesthesiologist perform nerve block ultrasound guidance ( Sonosite machine high frequency probe ) use 22G stimulate needle aseptic precaution . 0.5 % ropivacaine total dose 3mg/kg used block . Anesthesia maintain group O2/Sevo titrate minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) 1.5 . After surgical incision , dose 0.05mg/kg morphine give IV every 5 min need titrate HR BP within 10 % change baseline . Additional IV morphine dose 0.05mg/kg give every 10 minute recovery room ( PACU ) need pain ( Visual Analog score -VAS score &gt; 4 ) . Total morphine consumption , length recovery room stay side effect nausea vomit record PACU . The patient study give follow 1 . A prescription oral analgesic ( lortab : hydrocodone 5mg acetaminophen 325mg ) . 2 . A handout nerve block post op care ( patient RA group ) 3 . A handout depict visual analog scale 4 . Data sheet date , time , pain scale pain med , satisfaction scale , documentation side effect along stamped return envelope . The parent educate assess pain visual analog scale score . The parent instruct give one two pill depend weight ( one pill weight &lt; 50kg 2 pill weight &gt; 50kg ) every 4-6 hr . need pain ( VAS score 2 ) . The patient follow phone research nurse blind group postoperative day 2 day 8 . They ask total use analgesic end day 2 ( first 48hrs ) day 7 . Family satisfaction scale 1 to10 , Incidence side effect nausea , vomit , sleep disturbance , feed difficulty prolong numbness motor block also collect . The parent also request return data sheet stamp return envelope research team .</detailed_description>
