	<brief_summary>There considerable variation incidence out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) across Europe . The likelihood attempt resuscitation also vary . To good understand factor contribute variation , data incidence , management outcome OHCA require . A European , multi-centre study provide opportunity uncover difference throughout Europe may help find explanation difference . Results may also potential support development quality benchmarking European Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) . This prospective European study involve 27 different country . It provide common Utstein-based dataset , data collection methodology common data collection period participant , thereby potentially increase comparability . Study research question address follow : OHCA incidence different European region ; incidence cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) attempt ; initial presenting rhythm patient bystander EMS start CPR resuscitation intervention ; rate return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) ; patient status handover hospital i.e . ROSC , ongoing CPR , dead ; incidence patient still alive 30 day OHCA ; incidence patient discharge alive hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participate registry transfer unprocessed anonymised data . Transmission aggregate data avoid whenever possible ; case limitation due national law ethical requirement participate registry transmit aggregate data . Every single case require data sheet ( DS ) . Data collect within national , regional local participate registry ( either computer-based export national , regional local registry paper-based DS . After validation anonymisation data participate registry data transfer via national coordinator ( computer-based ) study centre . National coordinator responsible quality control i.e . completeness reliability accuracy data , include timely submission data study management group . Every DS identify unique number , include country region origin . Registries transfer unprocessed original data due reason mention collect data . These registry send aggregate data study centre . Participating registry must collect basic EMS data region population serve . This registry-specific information must transmit study period . Data ( computer paper-based ) handle accord national law concern data security ; national coordinator responsible maintain necessary standard . Access data protect username password .</detailed_description>
