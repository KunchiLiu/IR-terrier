	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Flu-like Symptoms Following Interferon Beta 1a Injections Patients With Multiple Sclerosis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flu-like symptom ( FLS ) fever , muscle ache , chill , fatigue common side effect interferon beta ( IFN-ß ) treatment may affect willingness patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) initiate therapy . The initiation phase MS treatment critical period affect patient ' view long-term acceptability adherence therapy , underscore need strategy reduce treatment-related adverse event FLS follow IFN-ß injection . Once-weekly intramuscular IFNß-1a , available since 1996 , indicate treatment patient relapse form MS slow accumulation physical disability progression frequency clinical exacerbation . Although intramuscular IFNß-1a generally well tolerate , FLS report 76 % patient receive treatment . Consequently , intervention reduce FLS IFNß-1a injection warrant . One approach reduce FLS dose titration . Titration practice initiate therapy lower start dose gradually increase dose define interval full dose reach . Moreover , combination dose titration pre-treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) acetaminophen healthy subject , sown reduce FLS severity 37-76 % . However , patient benefit dose titration also effect MS still determine . Consequently , type FLS management IFNß-1a injection determine . Interestingly , case report Finland Denmark suggest aerobic exercise able markedly reduce FLS symptom MS patient , far study evaluate . However , healthy subject know aerobic exercise capable positively influence immune system evidence suggest prophylactic effect exercise may , extent , induction anti-inflammatory environment bout exercise ( e.g . via increase circulate anti-inflammatory cytokine include interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor antagonist IL-10 ) . The exist evidence particularly suggestive acute effect aerobic exercise circulate cytokine level , could important mechanism explain potential positive effect aerobic exercise FLS . Consequently , purpose present study test hypothesis aerobic training reduce FLS follow interferon beta 1a injection patient Multiple Sclerosis . A secondary purpose evaluate whether change circulate cytokine provide mechanism explain potential positive effect .</detailed_description>
