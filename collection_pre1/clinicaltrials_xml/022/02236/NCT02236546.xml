	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well FDG-PET/CT measure early response patient stage III-IV melanoma receive chemotherapy . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) use metabolic image radiotracer , [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , selectively accumulate tumor . FDG-PET/CT advance melanoma , , treatment may improve method predict patient may benefit therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate treatment-induced change FDG uptake change tumor size progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive therapy advance melanoma . II . To correlate treatment-induced change FDG uptake change activity and/or expression available molecular biomarkers patient receive therapy advance melanoma . OUTLINE : Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT 2 week prior first dose therapy , completion first treatment course ( day 21 ) , completion fourth treatment course ( day 84 ) .</detailed_description>
