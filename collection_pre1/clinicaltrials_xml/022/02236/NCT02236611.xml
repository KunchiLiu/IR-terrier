	<brief_summary>This 12-week , multicentre , randomize , open-label , 2-arm , parallel-group study design compare efficacy safety umeclidinium inhalation powder ( 62.5 mcg daily [ QD ] ) administer via novel Dry Powder Inhaler ( nDPI ) glycopyrronium ( 44 mcg QD ) administer via BreezhalerÂ® inhaler subject COPD 12 week treatment . At end run-in period , eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive umeclidinium 62.5 mcg administer via nDPI glycopyrronium 44 mcg administer via BREEZHALER inhaler . There 8 clinic visit conduct outpatient basis Pre-Screening ( Visit 0 ) , Screening ( Visit 1 ) , Randomization Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) , Randomization Day 2 ( Visit 3 ) , Day 28 ( Visit 4 ) , Day 56 ( Visit 5 ) , Day 84 ( Visit 6 ) Day 85 ( Visit 7 ) . The total duration subject participation study approximately 15 week . The primary endpoint study clinic visit trough FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume one second ) treatment Day 85 . All subject spirometry perform clinic Visits 1 though 7 . Trough spirometry obtain 23 24 hour previous day 's dose open-label study medication Visits 3 7 .

	<criteria>Type subject : outpatient Informed Consent : sign date write informed consent prior study participation Age : subject 40 year age old Visit 1 . Gender : male female subject eligible participate study . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , eg , age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy OR child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly i.e. , accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen followup contact . Diagnosis : establish clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ERS ) Smoking history : current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; = 10 packyears [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( eg . 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ) ] . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history Severity Disease : A pre postalbuterol/salbutamol force expiratory volume one second/ force vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 &gt; =30 % = &lt; 70 % predict normal value Visit 1 . Predicted value base upon ERS Global Lung Function Initiative Dyspnea : A score &gt; =2 modify medical research council dyspnea scale ( mMRC ) Visit 1 Pregnancy : woman pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : current diagnosis asthma . Other respiratory disorder : know alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , active lung infection ( tuberculosis ) , lung cancer absolute exclusionary condition . A subject , opinion investigator , significant respiratory condition addition COPD exclude . Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis , pulmonary hypertension , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease . Other diseases/abnormalities : subject consider unlikely survive duration study period rapidly progress disease immediate lifethreatening illness ( e.g . cancer ) . In addition , subject condition ( e.g . neurological condition ) likely affect respiratory function include study . Severe hepatic impairment : patient severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) exclude unless , opinion investigator , benefit likely outweigh risk . Severe renal impairment : patient severe renal impairment ( e.g. , endstage renal disease require dialysis ) exclude , unless opinion investigator , benefit likely outweigh risk . Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : longacting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) use caution subject severe cardiovascular disease . In opinion investigator , use consider benefit likely outweigh risk condition : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month , Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV heart failure Contraindications : Any history allergy hypersensitivity anticholinergic/ muscarinic receptor antagonist , sympathomimetic , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate . Antimuscarinic effect : Subjects medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , urinary retention , prostatic hypertrophy , bladder neck obstruction include , opinion study physician , benefit outweighs risk . Hospitalization : hospitalization COPD pneumonia within 12 week prior Visit 1 . Lung resection : lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Visit 1 . 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : Investigators provide ECG review conduct centralized independent cardiologist assist evaluation subject eligibility . The Investigator determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation subject 's medical history exclude subject would undue risk participate trial .
