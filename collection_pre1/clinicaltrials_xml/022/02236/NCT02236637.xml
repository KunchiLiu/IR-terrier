	<brief_summary>The purpose registry document characteristic management patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) routine clinical practice , independent treatment use . Given rapidly evolve landscape mCRPC treatment , need current improve understanding treatment fit current treatment paradigm mCRPC , combine sequence , relative effectiveness profile emerge outside clinical trial setting . This base documentation description sequence treatment initiation , termination , duration ; relative effectiveness treatment ; define medical resource utilization ( MRU ) quality-of-life parameter follow-up survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Registry Observe Treatment Prostate Cancer Under Routine Medical Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-interventional , multicenter , prospective registry patient confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate presenting mCRPC , base document metastatic prostate cancer document castration resistance . Castrate-resistant prostate cancer define disease progression despite testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL , and/or androgen deprivation therapy , and/or history orchiectomy , may present continuous rise prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , and/or worsen exist disease/symptoms , and/or appearance new metastasis . Observational methodology use capture data . The decision patient take part registry influence medical care . Treatment decision make discretion treat physician , per routine clinical practice . Only data available routine clinical practice collect . It expect approximately 3,000 patient participate registry . To ensure patient population representative clinical practice reduce selection bias , patient meet eligibility criterion participate site consecutively enrol registry , irrespective treatment . The planned total duration registry 5.5 year date first patient enrol , irrespective country registry site . The anticipated duration patient enrollment 2.5 year . The maximum duration follow-up individual patient observational period registry 3 year , regardless enrol . The 3-year period observational period document sequence systemic mCRPC treatment routine clinical practice , consider life expectancy patient mCRPC registry . Unless specify otherwise per local regulation , patient must give informed consent participate registry data collection ( ie , data entry case report form [ CRF ] ) perform . Patients enrol time initiation new systemic mCRPC treatment period patient consider surveillance accord clinical practice . Baseline data collection include detail patient 's prostate cancer history prior prostate cancer treatment . This follow prospective observational period patient may cycle multiple systemic mCRPC treatment period period surveillance . During observational period , data collect following time point patient 's course treatment routine clinical practice : initiation new systemic mCRPC treatment ; termination systemic mCRPC treatment ; duration systemic mCRPC treatment surveillance period &gt; 3 month , data collection perform minimum frequency 3-monthly interval period . Survival data collect patient 3 year enrollment close registry , whichever occur first , except patient withdraw consent prior complete observation period .</detailed_description>
