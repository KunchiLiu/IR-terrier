	<brief_summary>This study do follow reason : - The study two part . The purpose first part ( Phase I ) study find high dose neratinib give safely T-DM1 . - The purpose second part study ( Phase II ) find whether dose neratinib T-DM1 determine Phase I keep breast cancer get bad period time . - In order learn study therapy level blood discover genetic protein change associate cancer , study include special research test use sample blood breast tumor . Blood sample collect study treatment , treatment , study treatment stop . - In optional part study , three biopsy perform obtain fresh tumor sample area cancer spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study Evaluating Combination Trastuzumab Emtansine ( T-DM1 ) With Neratinib Women With Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FB-10 study design open label , single arm , Phase Ib/II study dose-escalation phase expand cohort ( phase II ) evaluate combination trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) neratinib woman metastatic , HER2-positive breast cancer . The primary aim phase Ib portion study determine safety tolerability two-drug combination . The primary aim phase II portion demonstrate efficacy . Patients receive concurrent therapy T-DM1 ( 3.6 mg/kg IV ) Day 1 3-week ( 21 day ) cycle neratinib continuous daily oral dose . The neratinib dose-escalation include 4 dose level ( 120 mg , 160 mg , 200 mg , 240 mg ) . At recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) T-DM1 neratinib combination , 39 additional patient treat . The sample size phase I portion study 2 24 patient . The sample size Phase II portion 42 patient . Approximately 6 patient Phase I RP2D level include Phase II portion . The total study enrollment maximum 63 patient . Accrual expect occur 16 month . Submission diagnostic tumor sample blood sample FB-10 correlative science study study requirement patient . Blood sample collect baseline , Cycle 2 , Day 1 , progression . Blood sample pharmacokinetic ( PK ) determination collect Phase 1 site consent patient various time point first 24 hour study therapy ( Cycle 1 , Days 1 2 ) . An optional tumor biopsy procure consent patient accessible site metastasis study dose level assignment ( patient sign consent form screen eligibility ) , Cycle 1 treatment , time disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The ECOG performance status must great equal 2 . Patients must ability swallow oral medication . Patients must histologic cytologic confirmation diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast . Patients must antiHER2 base therapy metastatic disease ( may include trastuzumab pertuzumab either sequentially combination ) . There must documentation patient evidence measurable metastatic breast cancer . Histologic confirmation metastatic disease require . Patients must estrogen receptor ( ER ) analysis perform prior study entry . If ER analysis negative , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) analysis must also perform . ( Patients eligible either hormone receptorpositive hormone receptornegative tumor . ) Breast cancer must determine local test human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive prior study entry use American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) College American Pathologists ( CAP ) HER2 test guideline . At time study entry , blood count perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet following criterion : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1000/mm3 ; platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin must great equal 9 g/dL . ( Note : Patient must discontinue growth factor great equal two week prior entry lab . ) The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet : Total bilirubin must less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab less equal 5 x ULN liver metastasis . Serum creatinine perform within 4 week prior study entry must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . The left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assessment 2D echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan perform within 90 day prior study entry must great equal 50 % regardless facility 's low limit normal ( LLN ) . Patients reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception therapy , least 7 month last dose study therapy . Exclusion Criteria Previous therapy TDM1 HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) include neratinib malignancy . Symptomatic brain metastasis brain metastasis require chronic steroid control symptom . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C abnormal liver function test ; HIV positive patient receive antiviral . Lung disease result dyspnea rest . Active infection chronic infection require chronic suppressive antibiotic . Malabsorption syndrome , ulcerative colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , resection stomach small bowel , disease condition significantly affect gastrointestinal function . Persistent great equal grade 2 diarrhea regardless etiology . Conditions would prohibit intermittent administration corticosteroid TDM1 premedication . Chronic daily treatment corticosteroid dose great equal 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent ( exclude inhale steroid ) . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic BP great 150 mmHg diastolic BP great 90 mmHg , without antihypertensive medication . ( Patients hypertension well control medication eligible . ) Cardiac disease ( history and/or active disease ) would preclude use drug include treatment regimen . This include confine : Active cardiac disease : symptomatic angina pectoris within past 90 day require initiation increase antianginal medication intervention ; ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction ; supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication ; conduction abnormality require pacemaker ; valvular disease document compromise cardiac function ; symptomatic pericarditis History cardiac disease : myocardial infarction document elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment leave ventricular ( LV ) function ; history document congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ; document cardiomyopathy Other nonmalignant systemic disease would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require follow . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( Note : Pregnancy test perform within 14 day prior study entry accord institutional standard woman childbearing potential . ) The investigator ass patient determine psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude meeting study requirement . Use investigational agent within 4 week prior study entry .</criteria>
