Therefore , global objective generate high-level evidence dietary intervention milk milk product enhance PBM young men woman maintenance BMD parent . The primary objective demonstrate healthy young men woman ( 14-18.9 baseline ) habitually low usual milk milk product intake intervention great milk milk product consumption improve lumbar spine BMD dose-response manner 2 ( account body size , physical activity , demographic age ) . Healthy young men woman recruit screened usual intake milk milk product . Those low intake &lt; 2 serving milk milk product randomize ( stratified sex age ) 1 3 group RCT ( n=10090/group ) : maintain usual low intake ( &lt; 1 serve ) , improve intake ( average 2 servings/d ) recommend intake ( ≥3 servings/d ) milk milk product . A manualized motivational interviewing framework use intervention . Those meeting recommendation screen form longitudinal cohort 2 . Key measurement include baseline yearly assessment BMD multiple sit plus interim assessment general health , anthropometry , dietary intake , physical activity biomarkers calcium homeostasis ; young adult bone metabolism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The final stage development peak bone mass ( PBM ) take place late adolescence early adulthood vital attain optimal bone health . The variation bone mineral density ( BMD ) time PBM similar aging , suggest benefit effort enhance BMD early later realize age . Therefore , optimization PBM maintenance BMD thus best population health strategy primary prevention osteoporosis reduction risk fracture . Osteoporosis bone disease result low bone mass reduce bone tissue , thereby , increase bone fragility . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) define osteoporosis BMD value 2.5 SD reference population specific PBM associate elevate risk fracture . Diet activity key lifestyle factor primary prevention osteoporosis . The number recommend serving milk alternative varies age actual intake estimate target Canadians 9 age old . For example , young men woman , age 15 18.9 year , consume 3 4 servings/day milk alternative accord Canada 's Food Guide , however , reality , adherence food guide recommendation norm Canadians intake low 1.36 serving male 1.24 serving females average . If Canadians realize benefit meet Canada 's Food Guide recommend serving Milk Alternates Food Group , least term meet nutrient intake recommendation bone health outcome , behavior change necessary . There evidence increase milk and/or milk product proven approach achieve calcium intake benefit bone health . From professional counsel perspective , motivational interviewing technique useful stimulate sustain behavior change give success trigger change number health behavior . Besides counseling , research suggest family environment social support system predict ability make behavior change . Healthy physical activity nutrition reliant upon parental behavior , belief perception may also include practical parental support model healthy food intake accessibility healthy food home . Therefore , study role parent increase child 's dairy intake added-value study . Research Center : All objective exclusively test one research centre , Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit McGill University . This unit administratively link School Dietetics Human Nutrition Dr. Weiler Director . Population : Healthy young men woman ( n=270 ) 14 18.9 age Greater Montreal Area reside parent ( ) ; one 14 18.9 per household include . Design : Parallel randomize control dose-response trial use milk milk product main source calcium 14 18.9 young men woman ( n=270 ) Greater Montreal area 2 year study . Methodology Research : Males female ( 14-18.9 ) habitual milk milk product intake &lt; 2 servings/d randomize ( random number table ) one three group ; stratify base sex age ensure balance group . All ask consume milk serve milk product , example . For study milk skim , 1 % , 2 % whole , cheese process ( e.g . select regular cheddar , mozzarella ) yogurt may variable milk fat content . DETAILS OF MEASUREMENTS Demographics : Upon write consent , demographic survey complete parent include age education parent , family income range employment . Parents ask self-identify ethnicity participate child facilitate understanding relationship among culture , skin pigmentation baseline vitamin D status . Anthropometry : In fast state , weight height measure use standard clothing calibrate balance-beam scale wall-mounted stadiometer calculate BMI . Waist circumference measure accord Health Canada guideline . Body composition measure every 6 mo use BIA rapid assessment . Health Measures : General health history adverse event previous 6 mo document survey . At baseline , 1y 2y , participant heart rate blood pressure measure registered nurse . A short-form Profile Mood States ( POMS ) take baseline yearly . Activity : For study , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( iPAQ ) complete baseline every 6 mo determine physical activity level ; participant may also ask wear accelerometer ( tri-axial ActiGraph GT3X ( ActiGraph LLC , Fort Walton Beach , FL ) capture activity 2 weekday 2 weekend day prior visit objective measure activity . Dietary Intake Survey : A FFQ ( modify Harvard ) use English French ( 25 ) test adult use capture past intake ( 1 ) baseline , 12 24 mo . Dietary intake also capture use 24-h recall baseline , 1 , 3 6 mo 6 mo interval thereafter . Telephone call every 3 month child parent line improve compliance group . Exposure UVB : To help explain vitamin D skin type , exposure UVB ( i.e . endogenous synthesis vitamin D ) assess visit use change skin pigmentation constitutive ( inner upper arm ) facultative ( forehead , mid-forearm low leg ) sit use spectrophotometer . Travel UVB exposure include clothing habit ( eg , short sleeve , short hat etc . ) use sun block ( UVB level frequency use etc ) survey well . Measurements perform unexposed skin inner upper arm high correlation Melanin Index measurement perform expose forehead accord standard guideline . Bone Mass Assessment : The minimum detectable change areal BMD ( aBMD ) use DXA ~1 % type scan . In order confidently examine change BMD follow intervention young adult , study duration 2 . Whole body , LS vertebrae 1 4 ( AP lateral ) , leave hip ( total FN ) forearm ( non-dominant ) measure use Hologic 4500A fan-beam clinical densitometer baseline , 1 2 . For test , RCT participant wear standardize clothing ( cotton pant T-shirts ) . DXA rapid , take total 5-7 minute x-ray time , low radiation ( &lt; 10 uSV ) exceed limit x-ray exposure . Values compare Hologic normative database thus express BMC BMD along Z-scores applicable ( National Health Nutrition Examination Survey [ NHANES ] reference database ) CaMos data . Quality control data monitor maintain use proprietary LS bone phantom ( Hologic ) . To complement , tibia forearm BMD measure baseline , 1 2 well use peripheral quantitative compute tomography technique ( pQCT ) . Unlike common technique measure BMD , pQCT scan able measure volumetric bone mineral density geometry bone whereas DXA able provide areal bone mineral density . For measurement examine sit range 4 66 % distal radius tibia non-dominant side ; 4 % site provide trabecular rich region 66 % provide cortical bone assessment , also examine 14 % 38 % site tibia . Sample Procurement : All blood sample ( 2x 8-10 ml tube ) collect Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit Macdonald Campus McGill University 0700 1000 h fast state ( minimum 8 h ) separate plasma ( ~ 4 ml ) serum ( ~4 ml ) fraction immediately measure analytes store -80 oC analysis ; analytes susceptible degradation freeze thaw ( OC ) measure sample thaw Details Biochemistry : Vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , osteocalcin ( OC ) PTH concentration measure day ( batch monthly ) use Liaison autoanalyzer ( DiaSorin ) : Total Vitamin D ( sensitivity : 4 ng/ml ) ; bioactive PTH kit ( sensitivity &lt; 4 pg/ml ) OC ( sensitivity 0.3 ng/mL ) kit . In batch , manual ELISA use CTX . Ionized calcium measure on-site use radiometer blood gas tube within 4 h collection ; also provide u hemoglobin hematocrit concentration . Total serum plus urinary calcium creatinine lipid assessment include serum HDL , LDL total cholesterol ( LDL ) triacylglycerols measure MUHC clinical laboratory fee service system .</detailed_description>
