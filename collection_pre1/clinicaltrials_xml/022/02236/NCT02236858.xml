	<brief_summary>Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) Specific Aim # 1 : To determine whether air clean intervention improve home air quality improve respiratory symptom , quality life , lung function reduce risk exacerbation former smoker COPD . Hypothesis : An intervention use HEPA carbon filter air cleaner home former smoker COPD improve respiratory symptom , quality life , lung function reduce risk COPD exacerbation compare placebo ( sham air cleaner ) . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine whether air clean intervention improve home air quality associate intermediate outcome measure know link long term outcome COPD , include airway systemic marker inflammation oxidative stress , former smoker COPD . Hypothesis 2 : An intervention use HEPA carbon filter air cleaner home former smoker COPD associate low level marker inflammation oxidative stress know associated adverse outcome patient COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research do learn whether air clean intervention improve home air quality ( particulate matter ( PM ) nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) reduction ) improve respiratory symptom , quality life , lung function , reduce risk exacerbation former smoker COPD . The investigator place air pollution monitor home measure air quality five 1-week period ( 3 month 1 week pre-intervention , 1 week , 3 month 6 month post-intervention ) . During week monitoring , investigator ask diary keep breathe participant feel every day . Participant 5 home visit 5 clinic visit monthly telephone call time see participant feeling . One week home visit , monitor equipment pick . After 2nd monitoring period , active sham air cleaner place home .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 40 year , 2 . Physician diagnosis COPD , 3 . GOLD Stage IIIV disease FEV1/FVC ≤70 % FEV1 ( % predict ) &lt; 80 % , 4 . Tobacco exposure ≥ 10 packyears , 5 . Former smoker . We employ combination selfreport biochemical marker identify formersmokers . Exhaled CO ( eCO ) use marker smoking status , easy perform , provide immediate data noninvasive . Formersmokers report current smoking past 1 year AND exhale CO level ≤ 6ppm . This threshold chosen maximize chance distinguish true smoker exsmokers ( &gt; 95 % ) . 1 . Chronic systemic corticosteroid ( ≥ 3 month continuous use past 12 month ) , 2 . Other chronic lung disease include asthma , 3 . Living location home ( e.g. , long term care facility ) 4 . Home owner home occupant planning move change residence within study period .</criteria>
