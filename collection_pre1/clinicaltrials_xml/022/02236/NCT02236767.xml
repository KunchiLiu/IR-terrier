	<detailed_description>Study assessment conduct pre-baseline , weekly baseline assessment ( stable baseline establish , less 2 , 4 , 6 week patient respectively ) , weekly treatment , post-treatment . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compete pre-baseline , pre-treatment , post-treatment . Treatment entail daily ( 5 days/week ) session repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation use Neurostar Therapy System 6 week employ right-sided , low frequency stimulation ( 1 Hz , 900 pulses/session 30 session , 27,000 total pulse , intensity 90 % passive motor threshold ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . Neuronavigation direct coil placement DLPFC base upon structural MRI .</detailed_description>
