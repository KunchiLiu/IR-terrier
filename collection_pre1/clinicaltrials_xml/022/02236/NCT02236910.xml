	<brief_summary>Lu-DOTA-TATE ( Lutetium-177 octreotate ) radiopharmaceutical report effective controlling symptom increase quality life ; induce stable disease extend progression free survival ; induce ( good ) partial remission induce complete remission patient somatostatin receptor positive tumour . The purpose study assess efficacy Lu-DOTA-TATE measure progression free survival overall survival . This study also asses safety Lu-DOTA-TATE , quality life patient treat Lu-DOTA-TATE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Registry Study Lutetium-177 ( DOTA0 , TYR3 ) Octreotate ( Lu-DOTA-TATE ) Treatment Patients With Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroendocrine ( NET ) tumours secretory metabolic pathway typically find cancer utilized molecular image therapeutic targeting . The important somatostatin . Somatostatin receptor useful tool diagnosis treatment NET tumour somatostatin analogue octreotate radiolabeled lutetium-177 imaging therapy . In selected population patient , radioisotope therapy expert hand show safe effective palliative therapy stable disease , progression free survival benefit , symptom control improvement quality life . Lutetium-177 ( DOTA0 , Tyr3 ) octreotate use significant number clinical study show safe effective therapeutic agent patient NET tumour . The investigator intend confirm benefit lutetium-177 octreotate , could form basis national registry study lead registration therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
