	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ASP2215 combine cytarabine/idarubicin remission induction 7+3 schedule . Safety tolerability ASP2215 also evaluate . This study also characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ASP2215 give combination cytarabine/idarubicin remission induction high-dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) consolidation therapy newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia well evaluate effect ASP2215 PK cytarabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ASP2215 Combination With Induction Consolidation Chemotherapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part trial . In Part 1 , subject enrol successive cohort determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Dose escalation decision make base DLTs occur first dose ASP2215 remission induction . The treatment consist three distinct period : remission induction , consolidation maintenance . In Part 2 , subject enrol expansion cohort . Subjects receive ASP2215 MTD establish Part 1 recommend expansion dose , also receive remission induction , consolidation maintenance therapy . The DLT observation period expansion cohort start dose ASP2215 first remission induction treatment Day 21 first consolidation cycle start second consolidation cycle , whichever sooner ; well start maintenance treatment Day 28 second maintenance cycle . If test dose level must stop , low dose may test remain subject enrol .</detailed_description>
