	<brief_title>Cardiotoxicity Prevention Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Anthracyclines and/or Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over year , due use new generation therapeutic regimen , well use advanced radiation technique , curability breast cancer reach overall 10-year survival rate approximately 80 % . Anthracyclines key role treatment breast cancer . Many publish study show benefit disease-free survival patient positive lymph node treat anthracyclines-based regimen . Many anthracyclines taxanes-based regimen currently use clinical practice treatment breast cancer . Numerous randomized trial confirm benefit addition taxanes anthracyclines . Trastuzumab recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody specificity extracellular domain human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . The use trastuzumab administer sequentially concurrently adjuvant chemotherapy compare chemotherapy patient HER2 positive evaluate several randomized trial . Many data concern incidence adverse cardiovascular event acute , subacute late available . The cardiac toxicity anthracyclines may acute , subacute chronic . The acute toxicity occur shortly infusion drug arrhythmia , case lead heart failure , pericarditis-myocarditis electrocardiographic abnormality . The acute toxicity usually reversible dose-dependent manner . The acute subacute toxicity rare ( 1-4 % ) . Data available concern clinically relevant cardiac toxicity chronic progressive deterioration ventricular function heart failure . Beside cumulative dose risk factor , unfavourable feature advance age , female sex , combination anthracyclines trastuzumab evaluate . In case , late toxicity occurs within first year follow completion chemotherapy nevertheless clinical manifestation occur even 10-20 year . This fact suggest woman treat ( neo ) adjuvant set strongly necessary echocardiographic monitor even long time . The aim study analyze protective impact cardiac damage beta blocker ACE inhibitor breast cancer patient treat anthracyclines-based chemotherapy without trastuzumab , use myocardial strain image monitoring .</detailed_description>
