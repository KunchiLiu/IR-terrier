	<brief_summary>The investigator investigate effect traffic-related diesel exhaust lung function immune system risk COPD . The individual expose either filter air ( FA ) carefully control level diesel exhaust ( DE ) exposure chamber . Post exposure individual complete steady state exercise test . 24h later , procedure call bronchoscopy ( whereby thin , flexible tube place throat lung ) use sample collect lung . After 1 month entire procedure repeat alternative exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : To study effect traffic relate diesel exhaust people risk develop COPD . 2 . Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : An increase protein , expose lung blood , associate pathophysiology COPD . Hypothesis 2 : Air trap , dyspnea , impaired exercise tolerance . Such increase pronounce COPD control subject . 3 . Justification : The use diesel engine increase fuel-efficient gasoline engine . However , diesel engine produce different emission gasoline engine . Diesel exhaust emit tailpipe `` on-road '' diesel engine vehicle ( diesel car , bus truck ) `` non-road '' diesel engine ( locomotive , marine vessel construction equipment ) . Diesel exhaust consist gaseous particulate air pollutant . People COPD may sensitive air pollution ; would like know diesel exhaust ( DE ) affect respiratory immune system . We expect response noticeable participant ; expect response may occur detectable careful examination cell tissue ( e.g. , bronchoalveolar lavage ( fluid lung ) , blood ) . Understanding subtle change help u prevent health problem associate air pollution future . 4 . Objectives To provide biological plausibility deepen mechanistic understanding emerge epidemiology suggest strong role air pollution COPD . 5 . Research Methods : This blind crossover experiment two condition ( 300 µg/m³ diesel exhaust filter air ) , randomize counter-balanced order . Data collection condition separate 4-week washout period . Prior exposure participant : 1 ) complete questionnaire , 2 ) undergo set lung function test ( breathe test ) , 3 ) undergo incremental exercise test 4 ) receive physical exam primary investigator . A small sample blood spirometry measurement also collect analysis . After exposure another series exercise lung function test perform . Blood , spirometry measurement , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , endobronchial brushing biopsy also collect examination cellular , functional immunological change influence airway .</detailed_description>
