	<brief_summary>During past three year , revolutionize radical surgical approach rectal cancer ( `` TME `` approach `` transanal TME ( TaTME ) '' approach , opposite conventional approach ) emerge concept combine natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) total mesorectal excision ( TME ) curative intent . The feasibility , safety reproducibility first demonstrate swine survival experiment subsequently human cadaver series , successfully apply human patient center around world , perform assistance laparoscopy , namely hybrid transanal TME . In addition , pure-NOTES without conventional laparoscopic assistance ( scar ) also demonstrate , though case limit . In initial stage , group successfully perform no-scar transanal TME series human cadaver satisfactory outcome . Hence investigator conduct study , look see pure transanal NOTES investigational procedure safe effective approach radically remove rectal cancer mid low rectum meanwhile , reduce pain , gain fast recovery good function life quality gain best cosmetic effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility Safety No-scar Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transanal total mesorectal excision ( TaTME ) novel development field colorectal surgery combine mini-invasive concept natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) , technique single-port laparoscopic surgery principle total mesorectal excision curative intent treat rectal cancer . Based platform either transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) transanal minimally invasive surgery ( TAMIS ) , innovative way retrograde TME dissection bottom without laparoscopic assistance . It suppose facilitate distal rectal mobilization , thus achieve precise sufficient distal margin reduce need multiple stapler firing transect rectum , consequently decrease anastomotic leakage rate especially important obese male patient narrow pelvis exposure distal rectum abdominal approach prove difficult . It could also protect neurovascular bundle well visualization exposure advantage good function avoid sacrifice sphincter . After series preclinical trail animal cadaver , successfully apply human successional report prove feasibility safety . However , majority publish series hybrid NOTES , need assistance conventional laparoscopic surgery bottom abdominal incision , scar , pain incision relate complication wound infection , abscess , hernia implant incisional tumor necessary avoid . It also worry cost increase since two group surgical equipment need ( abdominal perineal ) surgical staff require two team operate time ( two-team approach ) . Up date , far know , pure transanal TME NOTES without laparoscopic assistance also successfully perform human patient though case rare . The investigator center also successfully perform pure-NOTES rectal resection human cadaver past month , confident move forward conduct pilot study evaluate feasibility safety surgery rectal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
