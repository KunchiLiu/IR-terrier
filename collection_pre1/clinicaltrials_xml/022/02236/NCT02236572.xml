	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether add everolimus hormone treatment breast surgery increase chance shrink breast cancer patient hormone-responsive breast cancer lower Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score ( 25 less ) , compare prior experience hormone therapy alone . Everolimus drug currently approve use United States Food Drug administration ( FDA ) treatment patient advance metastatic kidney breast cancer . Everolimus consider investigational non-metastatic breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis hormone receptor positive , HER2 negative invasive breast carcinoma . Tumors must estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive accord ASCO/CAP 2010 guideline either ER PR ≥ 1 % positive nuclear stain immunohistochemistry . Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor result Oncotype Dx accept . Tumors must HER2 negative define accord ASCO/CAP 2013 , HER2 0 1+ IHC nonamplified FISH CISH . If HER2 IHC 2+ , FISH/CISH must perform must positive ( must ratio &lt; 2 ) , otherwise FISH/CISH require IHC 0 1+ institutional standard . Patients must prior ipsilateral breastconserving surgery total mastectomy eligible neoadjuvant treatment . Clinical Stage IIIIIC ( T24 N03 M0 ) mammogram , ultrasound MRI Baseline Oncotpye Dx recurrence score &lt; 25 . Staging study CT scan chest abdomen bone scan , PET/CT require clinical stage III , consider optional stage II breast cancer . Patients multifocal , multicentric synchronous bilateral breast cancer allow : Multifocal disease define one invasive cancer &lt; 2 cm large lesion within breast quadrant . Multicentric disease define one invasive cancer ≥ 2 cm large lesion within breast quadrant one lesion different quadrant . Synchronous bilateral disease define invasive breast cancer breast , diagnose within 30 day . In patient multicentric bilateral invasive breast cancer , sample lesion must hormone receptorpositive HER2negative . Any lesion measure &gt; 1 cm must Oncotype Dx score must &lt; 25 . Lesions less 1 cm size require Oncotype Dx . One lesion ( typically large ) designate target lesion clinical radiographic response neoadjuvant therapy judge . Patients hormone receptorpositive , HER2negative invasive cancer meet study criterion may ductal carcinoma situ another quadrant breast contralateral breast even DCIS hormone receptornegative . Patients must adequate bone marrow function , define peripheral granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mL , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL platelet count ≥ 100,000/ mL within 28 day prior registration . Patients must adequate hepatic function obtain within 28 day prior registration document follow : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.0 mg/dL due Gilbert 's Syndrome ) ALT AST ≤ 1.5 x Institutional Upper Limit Normal ( IULN ) Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5 x IULN Patients must adequate renal function serum creatinine level ≤ IULN within 28 day prior registration . Patients must fast cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dl OR ≤7.75 mmol/L triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x IULN obtain within 28 day prior registration . Patients may lipid lower agent reach value . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must able take oral medication . Postmenopausal woman ( woman consider postmenopausal childbearing potential &gt; 18 year age 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom biochemically postmenopausal estradiol FSH level ) prior enrollment , surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) prior registration . Medical ovarian suppression LHRH agonists render patient postmenopausal acceptable . 16 . Patients legally authorize representative must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent prior screen procedure accordance institutional federal guideline . Patients must inflammatory breast cancer ( T4d ) must metastatic breast cancer ( Stage IV disease ) . Patients must prior exposure mTOR inhibitor ( e.g . rapamycin , everolimus , sirolimus , temsirolimus , deforolimus ) . Patients must prior treatment investigational drug within precede 28 day must plan receive investigational drug duration study . Patient may impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption drug ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % within 28 day prior registration despite adequate therapy . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled cardiac disease within ≤ 6 month prior start everolimus , include : unstable angina pectoris , Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV , myocardial infarction , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease Patients must organ allograft history immune compromise . Patients must receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients must know history HIV seropositivity Patients must know diagnosis hepatitis B C. Patients follow risk factor must hepatitis screen pretreatment : Blood transfusion prior 1990 Current prior IV drug user Current prior dialysis Household contact hepatitis B C patient Current prior highrisk sexual activity History jaundice . Patients must know uncontrolled underlying pulmonary disease severely impaired lung function ( spirometry DLCO 50 % less normal O2 saturation 88 % less rest room air ) , Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection . Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start Everolimus , plan receive vaccination protocol treatment . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine ; Patients currently part participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 1 month prior dose ; Patients must take within 14 day prior registration , take , plan take protocol treatment , strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , and/or CYP3A4 inducer . Patients active bleeding diathesis .</criteria>
