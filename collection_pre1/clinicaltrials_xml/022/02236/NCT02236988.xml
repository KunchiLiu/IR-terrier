	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Apremilast Heatlhy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , crossover , single modified-release-dose , study male subject evaluate pharmacokinetics prototype modified-release formulation compare reference immediate-release apremilast formulation . Subjects randomly assign treatment sequence . A total 8 test MR formulation may evaluate . Group 1 : 4-sequence , 4-period compare three modified-release prototype reference immediate-release formulation . A total 16 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete 4 period . One two scenario conduct second group depend availability modified-release formulation . This single-center , open-label , crossover , single modified-release-dose , study male subject evaluate pharmacokinetics prototype modified-release formulation compare reference immediate-release apremilast formulation . Subjects randomly assign treatment sequence . A total 8 test MR formulation may evaluate . Group 1 : 4-sequence , 4-period compare three modified-release prototype reference immediate-release formulation . A total 16 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete 4 period . One two scenario conduct second group depend availability modified-release formulation . Group 2/Scenario 1 : This 4-sequence , 4-period design identical Group 1 . This occur three modified-release formulation plan Group 2 available . A total 16 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete 4 period . Group 2/Scenario 2 : This 6-sequence , 3-period design . This occur two modified-release formulation test Group 2 . A total 18 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete 3 period . A third group may enrol evaluate pharmacokinetics one two additional prototype formulation ( initial six ) compare immediate-release formulation . One two scenario conduct third group depend availability prototype formulation . Group 3/Scenario 1 : This 2-sequence , 2-period design use one test formulation available . A total 14 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete period . Group 3/Scenario 2 : This 6-sequence , 3-period design identical Group 2/Scenario 2 . This occur two test formulation available . A total 18 subject enrol obtain least 12 subject complete 3 period . A fourth group may enrol evaluate PK four additional prototype formulation compare IR formulation . Group 4 : This 10-sequence , 5-period William Square design compare four MR prototype reference IR formulation . A total 30 subject enrol obtain least 20 subject complete 5 period .</detailed_description>
