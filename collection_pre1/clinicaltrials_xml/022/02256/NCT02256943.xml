	<brief_summary>Low dose tricyclic antidepressant drug routinely administer co-analgesics pain medicine . Amitriptyline largely consider gold standard . Amitriptyline underlie cytochrome CYP2D6 CYP2D19 metabolism . CYP2D6 highly polymorphic ; numerous genetic variant result 4 major class characterize enzymatic activity : poor metabolizers , intermediate metabolizers , extensive metabolizers ultrarapid metabolizers . It known extent metabolizer class determine pain outcomes side-effects . As one three pain patient consider responder amitriptyline 's co-analgesic effect , prediction treatment efficacy fast easy perform bedside test may contribute patient quality life . The aim study determine influence cytochrome variant experimental pain , drug relate side-effects finally identification active metabolite .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Pain define ongoing unpleasant sensory experience , classify accord three major , although overlapping , etiology : nociceptive , inflammatory neuropathic pain . Antidepressants widely use co-analgesics management chronic pain . An overview different substance relation mechanism action present review Dharmashaktu et al . Low-dose tricyclic antidepressant well establish treatment neuropathic pain . Amitriptyline imipramine two widely used substance group . The hypoalgesic effect amitriptyline mainly mediate inhibit serotoninergic noradrenergic reuptake . When administer night time , amitriptyline 's sedate effect enhances sleep quality , consider important improvement quality life chronic pain patient . Tricyclic antidepressant undergo biotransformation liver CYP2D6 catalyze hydroxylation , whereas CYP2C19 mediate demethylation parent drug . The demethylated metabolite partially tricyclic drug , nortriptyline desipramine , demethyl-metabolites amitriptyline imipramine . It unknown whether analgesic effect amitriptyline mediate precursor metabolite . The CYP2D6 gene highly polymorphic numerous genetic variant result 4 major metabolizer class characterize enzyme activity : poor metabolizers ( PM ) enzyme activity , intermediate metabolizers ( IM ) reduce enzyme activity , ( EM ) extensive metabolizers carry two functionally active allele ultrarapid metabolizers ( UM ) carry gene duplication multi-duplication result increased enzyme activity . CYP2D6 PMs high plasma concentration parent drug EMs , therefore , likely experience dose-dependent adverse drug reaction . In 50 psychiatric patient receive amitriptyline 150 mg/d , carrier two functional CYP2D6 allele ( EMs ) significantly low risk side effect IM ( 12.1 % vs. 76.5 % ) . The low risk observe carrier two functional CYP2D6 allele combine one functional CYP2C19 allele . The combination normal ( fast ) CYP2C19 slightly diminish CYP2D6 function lead high concentration toxic intermediate metabolite increase adverse event . On hand , CYP2D6 UMs may risk sub-therapeutic concentration result poor therapeutic response . Thus , genetically determine difference blood concentration antidepressant make dose adjustment advisable . However , finding dose recommendation evaluate psychiatric patient investigation antidepressant low-dosed co-analgesics available . Quantitative sensory test ( QST ) intensively use three decade explore central process painful stimuli patient healthy volunteer . QST develop assess response sensory stimulus , provide psychophysical method assessment nociceptive system . In addition , large cohort healthy volunteer investigate use QST measure produce reference value . QST measure base multimodal multi-tissue approach , combine different pain modality apply different tissue order gather sufficient discriminative information human nociceptive system . QST tool characterize analgesic efficacy amitriptyline . QST offer unique opportunity experimentally induce pain quantitatively measure psychophysical , behavioural neurophysiological response . Objective We test hypothesis extensive ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers associate high analgesic effect amitriptyline , compare poor intermediate metabolizers , assess quantitative sensory test . Plasma concentration amitriptyline metabolite analyse co-variates drug efficacy . Two sub-studies , one peak-level , single-dose administration one steady-state , repeat dose administration , need ass pharmacokinetics amitriptyline active metabolite . Statistics provide Jos√© A. Biurrun Manresa . Methods Two consecutive randomize placebo-controlled two-way crossover sub-studies amitriptyline conduct consenting , healthy , male volunteer . Both sub-studies aim : determine association CYP2D6 genotype , drug response measure QST plasma concentration amitriptyline metabolite . The first sub-study conduct single high dose amitriptyline ( 100 mg ) . The second sub-study conduct repeat low dos amitriptyline ( 25 mg ) day 10 day . In sub-studies experimental procedure statistical analysis perform . The difference sub-studies dose amitriptyline duration drug intake .</detailed_description>
