	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , common serious mental health condition , affect 25 % military personnel serve combat . People suffer PTSD may experience traumatic flashback , trouble sleeping , problem relationships . This study intend help identify gene influence increase risk PTSD , improve way detect treat condition future . Previous research study gene increase risk PTSD , none include Veteran-only population . The current study focus US Veterans , utilize VA Million Veteran Program ( MVP ) database approximately 300,000 participant August 2014 . In context , participant PTSD refer `` case '' Veterans without PTSD refer `` control . '' This project do three stage . The first stage look MVP-obtained data electronic health record ( EHR ) data implement method identify combat-exposed case patient PTSD combat-exposed control patient without PTSD . The second stage assemble validate study population 20,000 participant `` include 10,000 combat-exposed Veterans PTSD case 10,000 combat-exposed Veterans without PTSD control . The third stage conduct genetic analysis ( `` genotyping '' ) compare case control , identify gene associate increase risk develop condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Objectives Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) severe , sometimes disable , anxiety disorder develop potentially traumatic event involve actual threaten death , serious injury , sexual violation . The diagnosis PTSD require symptom least one month three category : re-experiencing , avoidance , increase arousal . In contrast acute response trauma , stress reaction person develop PTSD resolve quickly ; symptom last long period time may increase severity . The rate PTSD ( consequent disability ) especially high among combat-exposed military Veterans . Studies Vietnam combat veteran consistently find lifetime PTSD prevalence 25-30 % men , although rate persistent/chronic PTSD somewhat low ( 15-20 % ) . Studies OEF/OIF Army personnel report rate PTSD 10 % 15 % range follow deployment ( Thomas et al 2010 ) . These rate much high rate PTSD general US population , estimate 6.8 % ( Kessler et al 2005 ) . PTSD show influence genetically , previous work identify several possible gene increase risk PTSD . Although several genomewide association study ( GWASs ) conduct , correspond statistical power modest , none include Veteran-only population . The propose study address deficiency conduct well-powered case-control GWAS study large sample US Veterans PTSD `` case '' psychiatrically-healthy Veterans `` control . '' Preliminary Data Research Design The study use case-control design nest within VA Million Veteran Program ( MVP ) , genotype exposure variable PTSD diagnosis ( yes/no ) outcome variable . The pool potential PTSD case identify initially base self-report PTSD diagnosis previously complete self-report questionnaire collect MVP , evidence PTSD diagnosis VA electronic health record ( EHR ) . Specific validation procedure narrow pool confirm PTSD case control . Based available MVP VA EHR data , investigator estimate currently available source population 11,000 confirm PTSD case among approximately 145,000 MVP enrollee date . By time project get underway , number available case ( control ) even high , due ongoing enrollment MVP . Laboratory Methods Statistical Analyses This PTSD GWAS compare 10,000 combat-exposed Veterans PTSD 10,000 combat-exposed control . A to-be-selected microarray ( see narrative ) employ contains approximately 245K genomewide association marker , 250K exonic marker INDELs , 70K novel loss-of-function SNPs INDELs , 115K `` custom '' marker . Genotypes impute approximately 1KG statistical analysis , 50 putatively-associated SNPs initially impute genotyped directly sample . Anticipated Results Relevance Genetic loci affect combat-related PTSD risk resilience identify , provide important information inform therapeutic target related prevention treatment .</detailed_description>
