	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ass whether Dabigatran lead fast complete leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) thrombus resolution compare Phenprocoumon . The secondary objective trial assess impact Dabigatran versus Phenprocoumon complete LAA thrombus resolution rate week 6 change LAA thrombus volume treatment well assess compare safety tolerability drug . A total 110 patient atrial fibrillation LAA thrombus randomize receive either Dabigatran ( 150 mg bid ) Phenprocoumon ( INR 2-3 ) least three week . Thrombus resolution determine transoesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) 3 week start study treatment subsequently week 4 6 necessary , i.e . LAA thrombus yet resolve . The study terminate patient resolution LAA thrombus . For patient whose thrombus still exist 6 week treatment , study also terminate . Further treatment decide discretion treat physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resolution Left Atrial-Appendage Thrombus - Effects Dabigatran Patients With AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Dabigatran etexilate , direct thrombin inhibitor new oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) , show effectively prevent thromboembolic event patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . However , paucity data antithrombotic efficacy safety dabigatran resolution leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) thrombus AF patient . OBJECTIVE The primary objective RE-LATED trial ass whether treatment dabigatran result faster complete LAA thrombus resolution compare vitamin-K antagonist phenprocoumon . Secondary objective assess impact dabigatran complete LAA thrombus resolution rate treatment 6 week , change LAA thrombus volume treatment . Furthermore , study aim assess compare safety tolerability dabigatran vs. phenprocoumon . METHODS The study design prospective , multicenter , randomize , open-label , control , explorative , blind endpoint ( PROBE ) trial . Patients AF leave atrial appendage thrombus confirm transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) randomize receive either dabigatran ( 150 mg bid ) phenprocoumon ( INR 2-3 ) resolution LAA thrombus formation least 21 day . Thrombus resolution determine TEE 3 week treatment initiation subsequently week 4 6 , primary study endpoint ( LAA thrombus resolution ) yet achieve . A total 110 patient plan get randomize . CLINICAL CONTEXT This first control trial investigates safety efficacy NOAC resolution LAA thrombus patient AF .</detailed_description>
