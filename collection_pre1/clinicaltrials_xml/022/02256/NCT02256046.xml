	<brief_title>Predictive Factors Outcome Esophageal Ulcers After Endoscopic Treatment Esophageal Varices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Portal hypertension common clinical syndrome , define pathologic increase portal venous pressure , hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) increase normal value ( 1-5 mmHg ) . In cirrhosis , portal hypertension result combination increase intrahepatic vascular resistance increase blood flow portal venous system . Esophageal variceal bleed one serious complication portal hypertension , represent lead cause death patient cirrhosis . Each bleed episode associate 30 % mortality rate . Endoscopic therapy varix aim reduce variceal wall tension obliteration varix . The two principal method available esophageal varix endoscopic sclerotherapy ( EST ) band ligation ( EBL ) . Endoscopic therapy local treatment effect pathophysiological mechanism lead portal hypertension variceal rupture . However , spontaneous decrease HVPG occur around 30 % patient treat either EST EBL prevent variceal rebleeding . EST consist injection sclerosing agent variceal lumen adjacent varix , flexible catheter needle tip , induce thrombosis vessel inflammation surround tissue . During active bleeding , sclerotherapy may achieve hemostasis , induce variceal thrombosis external compression tissue edema . With repeated session , inflammation vascular wall surround tissue lead fibrosis , result variceal obliteration . Furthermore , vascular thrombosis may induce ulcer also heal , induce fibrosis . There technical variation perform EST , type concentration sclerosants , volume inject , interval session , number session Endoscopic band ligation ( EBL ) generally accept treatment choice bleed esophageal varix . It show good result term control active bleeding , untoward effect . Esophageal ulceration ulceration occur esophageal mucosa successful ligation . However , ulcer follow Esophageal Variceal Ligation ( EVL ) less severe ES . Aim thesis predict incidence esophageal ulcer bleed endoscopic management esophageal varix . . This study department Tropical Medicine Infectious Diseases , Tanta University , least six month period august 2014 march 2015 target number patient reach whichever longer . The study include 224 patient undergo endoscopic management esophageal varix : Methods : All patient subject : - full history take . - -complete clinical examination . - -investigations group : ) Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) ii ) liver function test iii ) Kidney function test . iv ) ultrasound abdomen pelvis - Upper endoscopy day 0 , follow endoscopy day 14 6months End point : 1. ry end point : 14 day look characterize ulcer 2. ry end point : 6months look general local outcome intervention Inclusion criterion : Patient esophageal varix upper GIT endoscopy Exclusion criterion : Patients endoscopy esophageal varix ( EVs ) ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Unexpected risk course research clear participant ethical committee time , thrombophlebitis may occur take blood sample , investigator use sterilize technique take sample also bleed pinpoint needle track could happen , investigator needle track ablation avoid . The investigator use sterilize technique take sample . Informed consent take everyone give cod number . Names mention , picture take part body .
