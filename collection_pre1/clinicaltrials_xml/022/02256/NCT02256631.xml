	<detailed_description>VRC01 potent anti-HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibody , substance may potential prevent mother-to-child transmission HIV . This study enroll HIV-infected mother increase risk passing HIV child . The purpose study assess safety PK VRC01 HIV-exposed infant . This study enroll 39 mother-infant pair three group . Infants enrol Dose Group 1 receive single VRC01 20 mg/kg injection thigh less 72 hour birth . After 13 mother-infant pair enrol Dose Group 1 study staff review safety data , staff enroll 13 mother-infant pair Dose Group 2 . Infants Dose Group 2 receive single VRC01 40 mg/kg injection thigh less 72 hour birth . Study staff review safety data 6 participant Dose Group 2 enrol 13 mother-infant pair Dose Group 3 . Infants Dose Group 3 receive VRC01 40 mg/kg injection thigh less 5 day birth . They receive VRC01 20 mg/kg injection thigh monthly least 6 month ( 24 week ) 18 month ( 72 week ) breastfeeding . The mother Groups 1 , 2 , 3 receive VRC01 injection . At study entry , mother undergo medical history review blood collection . Infants Dose Groups 1 2 attend several study visit Week 48 . Infants Dose Group 3 attend several study visit Week 96 . Visits include medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , oral fluid collection .</detailed_description>
