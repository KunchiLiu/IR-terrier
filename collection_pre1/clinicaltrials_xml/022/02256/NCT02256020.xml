	<brief_title>Improvement Mechanism Wheel-chair Music Aerobic Exercise Depression Insomnia Among Elderly Long-term Care Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show two-thirds elderly resident live long term care facility lack regular exercise . The lack physical activity may cause decreased physical function , impaired immunity , insomnia depression . Insomnia affect circadian rhythm , control emotion blood pressure . Depression affect hormone regulation quality life . More importantly , depression recognize one world 's top three health problem World Health Organization . In Taiwan , previous study show prevalence depression community elderly 27.5 % ( Tsai , Yeh &amp; Tsai , Int J Geriatric Psychiatr . 2005 ) . We also demonstrate Tai Chi Chuan exercise improve balance , nerve conductivity immunity ( Yeh , Chuang , Lin , Hsiao , &amp; Eng , Br J Sports Med . 2006 ; Hung , Liou , Wang , &amp; Yeh , J Rehabilit Med . 2009 ) . A recent study follow 3500 elder ( &gt; 64 year age ) 8 year United Kingdom show exercise , matter age begin , significantly improve physical function ( Kaasalainen , Kasila , Villberg , Komulainen , &amp; Poskiparta , BMC Public Health . 2013 ) . Thus , hypothesize wheel-chair dependent elder , exercise le due physical disability , poor sleep quality cause emotional disturbance potential depression . A customized wheel-chair exercise elderly long term care facility might promote physical activity improve insomnia depression . Tai-chi Chuan exercise require endurance static posture suitable wheel-chair dependent elder . Our preliminary study find music aerobic exercise ( MAE ) could enhance certain immune function middle-age woman ( Yeh , Lai , Hsiao , Lin , Chung , &amp; Yan , J Phys Act Health 2013 ) . We choose modify MAE customize wheel-chair music aerobic exercise ( WC-MAE ) physical disable elder long term care facility . During past year , effectively modify original MAE novel WC-MAE . We develop WC-MAE program consist three weekly 50 minute session . These session classify moderate exercise goal maximum heart rate ( HRmax ) 65 % . During 2-year project , cluster randomization 170 participant ( 85 pair ) 4 long term care facility experimental group ( WC-MAE 10 minute warm , 30 minute exercise 10 minute cool ) comparison group ( watch TV 50 minute ) , base power 0.8 , effect size 0.28 , one-tailed , alpha value 0.05 10 % withdrawal rate . In first year , examine effect WC-MAE wheel-chair dependent elder self-perceived health , outcome expectation exercise , improvement insomnia depression score , pretest posttest 3 month . During second year study post-test 6 month , investigate mechanism improvement insomnia depression . Blood leukocytes plasma collect pre-test , 3 6 month post-test investigating change circadian gene expression , inflammatory cytokine , neuro-related hormone leukocytes plasma . The circadian rhythm , immunity hormone pathways analyze correlated change outcome .</detailed_description>
