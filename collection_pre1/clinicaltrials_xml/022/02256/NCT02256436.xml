	<brief_summary>Participants metastatic locally advanced/unresectable urothelial cancer recur progressed follow platinum-based chemotherapy randomly assign receive pembrolizumab Investigator 's choice paclitaxel , docetaxel , vinflunine . The primary study hypothesis pembrolizumab prolong Overall Survival ( OS ) Progression-free Survival ( PFS ) compare paclitaxel , docetaxel , vinflunine . The study 's interim analysis result demonstrate superior OS Pembrolizumab arm compare Active Comparator arm ( investigator 's choice : paclitaxel , docetaxel vinflunine ) . Based positive outcome OS interim analysis , effective Amendment 15 , eligible participant allocate Active Comparator arm experience disease progression provide opportunity crossover receive pembrolizumab 200 mg one time every three week ( Q3W ) two year treatment Crossover Phase study .</brief_summary>
