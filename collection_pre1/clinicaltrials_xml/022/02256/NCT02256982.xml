	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Neoadjuvant Therapy With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Patients With Resectable Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ass possibility use radiation therapy treat intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . Radiation therapy use many type malignancy , use treatment form gastrointestinal cancer limit . This treatment still study research doctor try find use treatment form gastrointestinal cancer . Short course photon radiation short course proton beam radiation therapy FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve radiation delivery system . This study also test safety neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy . Neoadjuvant therapy treatment give first step shrink tumor main treatment , usually surgery , give . Adjuvant therapy additional cancer treatment give primary treatment low risk cancer come back . The current standard care patient intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma offer surgical resection patient resectable disease able tolerate major surgical intervention . The study intervention involve trial may include one follow : - Chemotherapy ( Gemcitabine Cisplatin ) - Surgical Resection Lymphadenectomy - Radiation Therapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma ( IHC ) without evidence extrahepatic metastasis . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan . Participants resectable disease must single tumor ( satellite lesion ) total diameter long dimension ≤ 20cm . Patients unresectable disease must total tumor diameter &lt; 20cm ≤ 3 lesion . Satellite lesion define lesion ≤ 2cm dominant lesion permit participant unresectable disease Patients allow receive prior surgery chemotherapy IHC . Patients age ≥18 include study . Expected survival must three month great . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 70 % , see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5.0 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . No known active secondary primary malignancy . If patient underlying cirrhosis , ChildPugh classification Group A patient may include resectable cohort study . For patient unresectable disease , ChildPugh classification Groups A B allow . Clinical assessment ascites encephalopathy require . ChildPugh classification must determine study participant time eligibility analysis . Note albumin PT/INR require ChildPugh classification ; lab draw lab require eligibility analysis . Table 1 : ChildPugh classification liver function Score 1 2 3 Ascites Absent Slight moderate Severe Encephalopathy Absent Slight moderate Severe Serum albumin &gt; 3.5 g/dl 33.5 g/dl &lt; 3 g/dl Serum bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl 23 mg/dl &gt; 3 mg/dl Prolongation prothrombin time &lt; 4 second 46 second &gt; 6 second Score 5 6 corresponds ChildPugh class A Score 7 11 corresponds ChildPugh class B Score 12 15 corresponds ChildPugh class The effect gemcitabine+cisplatin develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Female patient child bear potential must indicate physician pregnant time enrollment negative serum pregnancy test . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . Participants receive anticancer investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition gemcitabine cisplatin . Women pregnant lactating . Participants evidence nonhepatic metastatic disease . Local condition systemic illness would reduce local tolerance radiation treatment , serious local injury , active collagen vascular disease , etc . Participants serious medical illness may limit expect survival le 3 month . Participants serious psychiatric illness social situation would limit adherence study requirement . Participants receive medication substance strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Because dose adverse event data currently available use gemcitabine+cisplatin participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Patients require anticoagulation receive lowmolecular weight standard heparin warfarin . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study gemcitabine class D agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gemcitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated gemcitabine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , DCIS , stage I prostate cancer , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction gemcitabine+cisplatin . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . HIVpositive individual HAART consider eligible demonstrated good compliance CD4 count &gt; 500 . Prior liver direct radiation . Patients peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 .</criteria>
