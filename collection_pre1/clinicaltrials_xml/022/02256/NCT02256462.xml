	<brief_summary>Objectives : To examine effect drug level-based personalized treatment adalimumab child Crohn 's disease . Design : A prospective , randomize , open label study . Setting : Pediatric gastroenterology center . Participants : Children 6 year 17 year diagnose CD plan receive adalimumab treatment . Main outcome measure : Pediatric Crohn 's Activity Index ( PCDAI ) 48 72 week . Secondary outcome measure : Corticosteroids free remission rate adalimumab 48 72 week . The effect routine adalimumab drug monitoring-based treatment trough level anti-adalimumab antibody therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Crohn 's Disease AdalImumab Level-based Optimization Treatment ( PAILOT ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy adalimumab induce maintain remission adult child moderate-to-severe Crohn 's Disease demonstrate multiple clinical trial . Despite effort optimize treatment , approximately 40 % patient initially respond anti-TNF ultimately lose response . Measurement adalimumab ( ADA ) drug level antibody adalimumab ( ATAs ) patient show assist decision make patient lose response course treatment . This approach base observation show high ADA concentration associate higher treatment efficacy loss response primarily attribute either undetectable drug level presence high titer ATAs . Existing data mostly base retrospective cohort study , nevertheless , concept routine therapeutic drug monitoring in-order improve efficacy still evolve . Recently , preliminary result Trough level Adapted infliXImab Treatment ( TAXIT ) study , perform adult IBD patient , fail demonstrate superiority level-based treatment clinically-based treatment regard rate response time . Nevertheless , premature conclude patient benefit tailored approach report abstract stratify patient accord type disease ( CD vs. ulcerative colitis ) significant advantage reduce rate antibody reduction CRP describe level-based arm . Anti-TNF treatment pediatric patient may differ adult due high risk develop rare hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma ( HSCTL ) young male treat combination therapy include thiopurines anti-TNF agent . Concomitant therapy ( use immunomodulators , mainly azathioprine ) demonstrate superiority mono-therapy become standard care moderate severe CD adult . In-view concern pediatric gastroenterologist concomitant therapy-induced adverse event option improve efficacy mono-therapy guide accord drug monitoring appeal . Therefore , aim ass efficacy routine therapeutic drug monitoring base treatment pediatric CD patient prospective randomize control trial . We hope study contribute understand potential benefit therapeutic drug monitoring base management pediatric patient treat anti-TNF agents.Hypothesis : We hypothesize routine measuring ADA trough level ATAs titer achieve high stable trough level result great corticosteroid free remission rate decrease LOR rate . We assume associate low frequency ATAs . We assume intervention reduce need alteration treatment scheme add immunomodulators switch treatment within class class . Objectives : This ADA therapy optimization study patient start receive ADA due active disease . 1 . Primary Efficacy Objective : To evaluate effect routine ADA drug monitoring-based treatment , comparison clinically-based monitoring disease activity . 2 . Secondary Objective : To evaluate effect routine ADA drug monitoring-based treatment trough level ATAs therapy .</detailed_description>
