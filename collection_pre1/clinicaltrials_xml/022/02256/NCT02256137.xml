	<brief_summary>Advances cancer therapy lead increase number adult survivor pediatric malignancy . Unfortunately , treatment childhood cancer continue require agent design destroy malignant cell line , normal tissue always spar . While early treatment- relate organ specific toxicity always apparent , many childhood cancer survivor report symptom interfere daily life , include exercise induce shortness breath , fatigue reduce capacity participate physical activity . These symptom may hallmark premature age , frailty . Frailty phenotype commonly describe old adult ; indicate person highly vulnerable adverse health outcome . Frailty may help explain nearly two third childhood cancer survivor least one severe chronic health condition 30 year diagnosis , childhood cancer survivor likely peer hospitalize non-obstetrical reason , mortality rate eight time higher age-and-gender match member general population . Frailty valuable construct distinguish disability co-morbidity , design capture pre-clinical state physiologic vulnerability identify individual risk adverse health outcome . These investigator recently present data indicate impaired fitness present survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia , brain tumor Hodgkin lymphoma . This relevant frailty , characterize cluster five measurement physical fitness , predictive chronic disease onset , frequent hospitalization , eventually mortality elderly person chronic condition . Using frailty phenotype early predictor later chronic disease onset allow identification childhood adolescent cancer survivor greatest risk adverse health . An early indicator risk adverse health allow researcher test , clinician provide , specific intervention design remediate functional loss , prevent delay onset chronic health condition . The investigator goal include characterize physical frailty five year time span population young adult survivor childhood cancer , well assess association frailty increase number severity chronic health condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Assessment Frailty Young Adult Survivors Childhood Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate change proportion young adult cancer survivor frail baseline point five year later . - Evaluate association frailty worsen chronic health condition . - Describe association demographic treatment factor risk prevalent frailty . - Estimate effect physical activity , diet smoking risk prevalent frailty . Participants complete study questionnaire ass social support , complete body composition study , walk speed test physical activity monitoring . In addition , data collect part SJLIFE protocol , include questionnaire , medical history physical , height weight measurement , physical functioning assessment result ( i.e . hand grip strength ) , neuropsychological evaluation result , may also use part evaluation study . The information collect study compare information collect previous SJLIFE clinic visit within previous 6 year .</detailed_description>
