	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether comprehensive care enhance new technology optimize asthma care home ( use special sensor track inhaler use hand-held PIKO-1 device ass patient ' forced expiratory volume 1st second [ FEV1 ] ) effective reduce total day medical treatment give outside home ( clinic , emergency department , hospital ) among child severe asthma receive comprehensive care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Centered Comprehensive Care ( HCCC ) Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION Asthma common pediatric chronic disease . Despite understand pathophysiology availability effective therapy , adverse effect health , school attendance , academic achievement , family life remain high , particularly among child severe asthma minority low income family . Innovative new approach need . One innovation show cost-effective high-risk chronically ill child , include child severe asthma , care enhance medical home , High-Risk Comprehensive Care ( HRCC ) design optimize care medical setting . The innovation pilot-tested propose research Home-Centered Comprehensive Care ( HCCC ) design also optimize care home thereby reduce clinic visit school absence decrease Emergency Department visit hospital day . The propose HCCC trial build infrastructure , cell phone access child 's primary caregiver hour , improve outcome establish previous HRCC trial ( clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT02128776 . DESIGN Pilot trial 80 child ( 2-18 year age ) uncontrolled severe asthma randomize either : - High-Risk Comprehensive Care ( HRCC ) include 24/7 cell phone access skilled caregiver , day care acute illness Monday Friday , subspecialty care available facility , identification weekday child ED visit hospitalization assure prompt follow-up coordination care ; - Home-Centered Comprehensive Care ( HCCC ) also include : 1 ) monitoring augment treatment adherence use special sensor track inhaler use identify inadequate excessive medication ; 2 ) use simple hand-held PIKO-1 device ass transmit caregiver 1-second forced expiratory volume , allow caregiver well assist parent make good treatment decision gauge response hour . HYPOTHESES HCCC associate : 1 . A &gt; 40 % reduction treatment day outside home ( clinic , ED visit hospital ) per child-year enrollment end trial ( primary hypothesis ) ; 2 . A decrease school absence respiratory problem &lt; 5 per school year ; 3 . An increase FEV1 &gt; 12 % routine pulmonary function test clinic 12 mo . enrollment ; 4 . Increased maternal satisfaction Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems Survey ; 5 . Reduced low net health system cost relative report common treatment method asthma ( express health system cost per clinic visit , ED visit , hospitalization , school absence prevent ) ; 6 . Reduced Medicaid cost ( due low reimbursement clinic , ED , hospital care ) ; 7 . An increase medical school cost relative reimbursement low saving Medicaid ( due reduction reimbursement ) . Such difference important effort promote adequate reimbursement care medical school OBJECTIVES : 1.To randomize 80 eligible child either standard HRCC HCCC addition HRCC pilot trial evaluate whether augmentation HCCC program : 1. reduce total day medical treatment give outside home ( clinic , ED , hospital ) ; 2. reduce day school miss respiratory illness ( include respiratory infection symptom aggravate asthma ) ; 3. improve routine pulmonary function test one year enrollment ; 4. augment maternal satisfaction care even high current level CC ; 5. reduce cost health system perspective government ( Medicaid ) perspective 6. increase cost relative reimbursement provider ( medical school ) perspective STUDY DESIGN : Pilot trial 80 severe asthmatic attend HRCC include 24/7 cell phone access skilled primary caregiver HRCC addition HCCC also include : 1 ) monitoring augment treatment adherence use special sensor track inhaler use identify inadequate excessive medication ; 2 ) use simple hand-held PIKO-1 device ass transmit caregiver 1-second forced expiratory volume , allow caregiver well assist parent make good treatment decision gauge response hour . The pilot trial duration 2 year . We measure efficacy base increase FEV1 routine pulmonary function test , reduce total day spend clinic , Emergency departments hospital , well reduce total day school miss due pulmonary illness . Safety assess look unexpected adverse event . With parental consent , also augment care use Linked In visualize child ass his/her condition . We recently survey asthma patient give CC surprise find 75 % ( 30/42 ) access `` Linked '' home computer smart phone .</detailed_description>
