	<brief_title>Pilot The Breast Cancer Endocrine Therapy Adherence ( BETA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 75 % breast cancer express estrogen and/or progesterone receptor ( hormone receptor ) . The standard care woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer five ten year adjuvant endocrine therapy drug tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) . In woman stage I-III breast cancer , treatment adjuvant endocrine therapy show reduce recurrence 30-50 % improve survival . Unfortunately , estimate large population databases 35-40 % patient may discontinue adjuvant endocrine therapy complete recommend 5 year various reason , non-adherence may reduce survival . The current protocol pilot study woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer begin adjuvant endocrine therapy , purpose assess feasibility two-way text messaging application , goal large randomize control study assess application increase adherence therefore improve disease free survival . This application include daily text message medication reminder periodic assessment side effect barrier medication adherence simultaneously offer assistance treatment related issue . The investigator collect information QOL financial burden 3 month period correlate metric adherence . This large randomize control study would first interventional study increase adherence adjuvant endocrine therapy breast cancer US . Our large randomize control trial would provide first longitudinal prospectively collect information QOL , financial burden adherence entire 5-year treatment period routine clinical practice setting .</detailed_description>
