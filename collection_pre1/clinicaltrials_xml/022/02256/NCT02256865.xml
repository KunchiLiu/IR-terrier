	<detailed_description>Screening Visits - To see able take part study , first outpatient visit CTRC ( Clinical Translational Research Center ) . This visit take 90 minute . - The following tests/procedures do visit : - We ask medical history past health - We give physical examination ( include digital rectal examination prostate gland age 40 ) - We ask answer sleep , mood general health screening questionnaire . - We ask complete questionnaire help u understand testosterone hormone control sexual function drive . - We draw 1 tablespoon blood needle place vein arm routine safety test check see hormonal problem . - We give ECG ( record heartbeat ) . For test attach 12-lead sensor chest . - We collect urine sample drug screen test . - A dietitian review meal plan inpatient stay ( Study Visit 1 3 ) . If first screen visit show able continue take part study , continue screen part study home . The follow do home : We ask undergo at-home actigraphy keep daily sleep diary two week document sleep habit . For actigraphy ask wear small wrist-watch like device . This device monitor record motion , also test sleep wake period . It may wear 2 week , 24 hour per day ( except take shower ) . If result at-home actigraphy show still able take part study , continue final part screen procedure inpatient visit conduct sleep study . The following tests/procedures do final screening visit : We ask come sleep laboratory sleep overnight ( sleep study ) . A technician attach lead ( wire ) body need keep lead night . The attached wire connect machine measure chest abdominal ( stomach area ) movement , airflow mouth lip , blood oxygen level , muscle tone , eye movement , heart rate electrical activity brain . In morning , technician remove attach wire . If exams , test procedure screen visit show continue study , 2 inpatient visit 2 outpatient clinical visit . Before begin study , assign one two study group describe . Which one assign decide chance ( like toss coin ) one two chance one group . A computer program place one study group . GROUP 1 : If assign group 1 , receive active drug visit 1 ( first inpatient visit ) placebo ( inactive drug receive drug ) visit 3 ( second inpatient visit ) . GROUP 2 : If assign group 2 , receive placebo ( inactive drug receive drug ) visit 1 ( first inpatient visit ) active drug visit 3 ( second inpatient visit ) . Neither study doctor choose group . Neither study doctor staff know study group medicine receiving . However medical emergency occur , information make immediately available study doctor . During inpatient visit receive active drug , receive : Ketoconazole pill . You swallow pill every 6 hour ( 4 time per day ) . Testosterone gel . You rub gel skin day morning . Hydrocortisone pills . You swallow pill 3 time day . During inpatient visit receive placebo ( inactive drug ) , receive : - Inactive placebo pill ( look like ketoconazole ) . You swallow pill every 6 hour ( 4 time per day ) . - Inactive placebo gel ( look like testosterone gel ) . You rub gel skin day morning . - Inactive placebo pill ( look like hydrocortisone ) . You swallow pill 3 time day . Night First Inpatient Visit Before come CTRC first inpatient visit , ask sleep 10 hour two consecutive night ( 10 PM 8 AM ) home . During sleep , wear actiwatch monitor sleep home . You drink alcohol 2 day period . We send text message telephone remind sleep time drink alcohol . The inpatient study visit cancel n't enough sleep home consume alcohol . Study Visit 1 ( First Inpatient ) For visit ask arrive CTRC later 5 PM first day . We allow go home sometime lunch 5th night . We give breakfast , lunch dinner set time CTRC . The meal standard , may eat interfere study result . The following tests/procedures do visit : We download information actiwatch verify sleep home . We put external lead body , occur sleep study , continuously check sleep EEG , actiwatch activity heart rate . We expose dim light ( measure `` body clock '' ) . From 7 PM bedtime every night , saliva collect hourly measure `` body clock '' . We ask fill short questionnaire measure sleepy , hungry computerized test cognitive function every 2 hour ( odd , even , hour ) . This take 5 minute . Starting 8PM first night , urine collect 8AM follow day . This repeated every 12-hour period whilst in-lab measurement component urine . We give Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) morning first last day ( two occasion ) CTRC . The OGTT test measure body 's ability use type sugar , call glucose , body 's main source energy . - Before test begin , insert cannula vein arm sample blood take . The cannula small plastic tube sample blood . It insert metal needle vein . The metal needle remove cannula place . - We ask drink liquid high glucose ( 75 gram ) . - In first hour , draw 5ml ( 1 teaspoon ) blood take cannula every 5 minute . - In second hour , 5ml ( 1 teaspoon ) blood take cannula every 10 minute - In third hour , 5ml ( 1teaspoon ) blood take cannula every 20 minute . - We draw additional 10ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood measure inflammation , hormone , gene expression , bone metabolism - The entire test take 3 hour . We give opportunity sleep discharge test sleepiness . Arrangements make driven home necessary . During time drink caffeinated drink , use nicotine product . Study Visit 2 ( First Outpatient ) This visit take place one week discharge first inpatient visit . At visit ask side effect draw 1 tablespoon blood complete blood count routine chemistry check , include liver function test . Study Visit 3 ( Second Inpatient ) This visit take place one week first outpatient visit ( 2 week first inpatient visit ) . This visit identical first inpatient study Visit 1 . For visit , receive active study drug first inpatient visit , receive placebo . If receive placebo first inpatient study Visit 1 , receive active study drug visit . Study Visit 4 ( Second Outpatient ) This visit take place one week discharge second inpatient visit . At visit ask side effect draw 1 tablespoon blood complete blood count routine chemistry check , include liver function test . All visit A total half pint ( 16 tablespoon ) blood collect study . We collect less would donate blood bank .</detailed_description>
