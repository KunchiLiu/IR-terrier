	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease one common condition see ophthalmic practice associate significant patient distress . Meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) among prevalent cause dry eye disease . This condition , often due obstruction meibomian gland orifice , may result significant ocular irritation . Traditionally , management MGD include warm compress , lid hygiene , anti-inflammatory medication . This randomized clinical trial design evaluate effect meibomian gland probe versus sham procedure case refractory MGD respond traditional treatment . Moreover , effect postoperative regimen also investigate use two different regimen . In addition symptom , change also evaluate term clinical sign well vivo confocal microscopy ( IVCM ) allow study cellular level .</detailed_description>
