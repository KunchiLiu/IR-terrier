	<detailed_description>Problem address Knee osteoarthritis degenerative joint disease prevalent general population cause significant functional impairment . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) definitive treatment choice , rarely accomplish complete restoration natural knee biomechanics . Various factor may influence post-operative function : pre-operative state knee , patient age , implant position , design . The natural low limb anatomy present femoral joint surface slightly valgus accord mechanical axis ( 1-5 degree ) tibial joint surface slightly varus ( 1-4 degree ) . This combination result oblique joint line orientation ( 1-3 degree ) mechanical axis pass near centre knee joint ( line centre femoral head centre ankle ) . Natural low limb alignment help balance load internal external knee compartment heel strike . Current practice orthopedics recommend TKA implantation femoral tibial component perpendicular mechanical axis ( 0 degree ) . In addition , order maintain ligament balance ( rectangular space ) flexion , external rotation femoral implant suggest ( 2-5 degree accord posterior femoral condyle surface ) . Therefore , current surgical technique replicate natural knee anatomy biomechanics . An alternative alignment method attempt replicate kinematics knee `` kinematic alignment `` . The principle behind kinematic alignment placement TKA component orthogonal 3-D orientation 3 ax describe normal knee kinematics restore prearthritic knee . Theoretical benefit kinematic alignment include less ligamentous release balance knee intra-operatively , rapid recovery , good range motion ( ROM ) , less post-operative pain , good knee biomechanics , improve patient satisfaction . However , major concern mid- long-term data implant survivorship ( absence loosen ) TKA base `` anatomical '' implantation . Because anatomical alignment differs classic mechanical alignment , author raise concern regard mid-term implant stability anatomical implantation technique . We propose compare clinical result TKA implant mechanical alignment ( standard practice ) kinematic alignment , double-blind , randomize trial . To standardize surgical technique minimize potential bias , procedures undertaken personalized instrument build Medacta , base patient 's CT-scan . There 2 primary objective research . First , implant stability respect bone measure time RSA , long-term survivorship estimate . Second , determine anatomical implantation provide clinical advantage , respect knee kinematic analysis , functional performance test validate self-reported questionnaire pain , function stiffness . Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) RSA , first develop Lund , Sweden , radiographic technique accurately assess implant position relative host bone . RSA gold standard measure implant stability short-term predicting implant survivorship long-term . It implement several decade safety well document . RSA 10 time accurate conventional radiography analyze implant migration pattern . Patterns micromigration exhibit various prosthesis fixation technique within first post-operative year show predict long-term component fixation bone . Knee biomechanical evaluation Estimating therapeutic efficacy knee TKA subjective current clinical practice method functional biomechanics assessment complex difficult apply . It suggest gait measurement monitor surgery patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) evaluate treatment outcome recovery . KneeKGTM ( Emovi Inc. , Laval , Quebec , Canada ) , simple minimally-invasive method measure 3D knee kinematics , develop available commercially . In system , motion sensor quasi-rigidly attached leg non-invasive ancillary system , reduce error skin movement relation bone . This measurement tool validate satisfactory assessment accuracy reproducibility femoro-tibial 3D kinematics gait . Principal research question - Compare migration anatomically- mechanically-aligned implant 2 year predict long-term survivorship total knee prosthesis insert two technique . - Compare clinical result anatomical mechanical total knee alignment self report pain , function stiffness questionnaire score . - Compare knee kinematics 2 group identify biomechanical marker explain subjective difference ( found clinical score ) . - Compare kinematics measure 2 technique asymptomatic knee . - Determine anatomical alignment offer technical benefit ( reduce intra-operative ligament balance ligament release ) compare mechanical alignment technique . - Compare post-operative rehabilitation group ( flexion , extension , straight leg raising , walk without assistance , etc. ) . Hypothesis TKA implant anatomical alignment provide good clinical outcome knee kinematics closer normal TKA implant mechanical alignment technique , Implant longevity show similar micro migration pattern two group measure RSA 2 year implantation thereby predict long-term implant survivorship similar group . Why trial need ? Current technological advance knee arthroplasty surgery allow surgeon implant TKA considerable accuracy . We however sure position place knee `` correct '' position patient . It think relatively high percentage patient completely satisfy outcome knee replacement may implant suboptimal position individual patient . The traditional mechanical alignment may optimal position patient . The anatomical alignment technique may reduce percentage dissatisfied patient . Implant company technology currently market surgeon patient without clinical data support claim . There also possibility place artificial knee joint anatomic position may impart negative impact longevity implant , thus increase early revision rate significant health cost associate . Thus become mandatory evaluate new technology widespread adoption clinical practice determine real benefit disadvantage change successful clinical practice ( mechanical alignment ) use last 40 year . Trial result This proposed clinical trial direct impact patient care demonstrate anatomical alignment TKA provide well clinical result mechanical alignment TKA similar migration pattern measure RSA . Then use anatomic alignment may become gold standard TKA procedure . Lacking accurate investigation surgical tool , anatomical alignment abandon early TKA era . Mechanical alignment select minimize error secondary failure . With novel technology ( personalized instrument build MRI ) , anatomical alignment might best way replicate knee biomechanics improve patient outcome TKA . The propose study allow u establish real value anatomical alignment safety .</detailed_description>
