	<brief_summary>Background : International study show substantial number child adolescent expose potentially traumatic event . Many child adolescent , experience posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , submit health care department shortly exposure common type traumatic event accidental injury , serious somatic illness death someone close . There research early psychological intervention prevention treatment PTSD . However , little research examine efficacy trauma-informed practice among health care professional ( HCPs ) . The present trial aim evaluate compare trauma-informed health care usual practice . Methods/Design : The primary clinical question investigation efficacy early , trauma-informed intervention prevention PTSD child adolescent follow exposure potentially traumatic event . The trail compare standardize trauma-informed practice usual care ( intervention ) health care department receive child adolescent exposure determine trauma-informed care associate reduction psychological outcome measure time . Specifically , investigator examine efficacy health care professional 's active use trauma-informed standard action trauma training program HCPs intervention group . The primary outcome reduction trauma , anxiety depressive symptom self-reports active intervention compare usual care . Discussion : This trial first control trial examine trauma-informed intervention carry HCPs . It provide first evidence efficacy health care deliver trauma-educated HCPs use trauma-informed standard action . A successful implementation protocol support thesis prevention PTSD among child adolescent benefit focus practice HCPs . If efficacious , result call future research extend investigation intervention psychological treatment HCP-based care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Trial Early Intervention With Children Adolescents Exposed Nonrelational Traumatic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background A significant number child adolescent expose potentially traumatic event ( PTEs ) . American Australian study report prevalence 20-25 % high magnitude traumatic event among adolescent . A Danish study four Nordic country find 90 % adolescent mean age 14.5 year expose least one low magnitude traumatic event . A potentially traumatic event may either relational sexual physical abuse nonrelational illness , motor vehicle accident fire . The incidence nonrelational trauma high child adolescent accidental injury large cause morbidity mortality among child United States well Denmark . Although many child adolescent demonstrate great resilience appear briefly affect nonrelational traumatic event significant minority young people develop posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , posttraumatic stress symptom ( PTSSs ) psychological difficulty follow exposure trauma . Accidental injury common type trauma . Researchers report prevalence rate PTSD among child adolescent road traffic accident range 6 % 35 % . Rates PTSSs ( also term subclinical , subthreshold partial PTSD ) range 11 % 50 % 6-14 . These rate important since recent research indicate minor difference term distress impairment child meet full partial criterion PTSD . The diagnosis medical illness cancer diabetes also show cause PTSD child adolescents prevalence rate 5.4 % diabetes 10 % 18 % cancer . A recent meta-analysis prevalence related injury illness report average prevalence rate PTSD related injury range 0 % 37.5 % , mean 19.82 % , rate ill youth range 0 % 32 % , mean 12.04 % . Preventive intervention child adolescent Given high prevalence rate exposure likewise high prevalence rate PTSD PTSSs PTEs press need preventive intervention decrease risk PTSD . In recent systematic review Forman-Hoffman et al . ( 2013 ) intervention child expose nonrelational traumatic event 6 different intervention base exclusively exposure identify . These include trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy child family traumatic stress intervention ( CFTSI ) , 2 different school intervention element CBT , early psychological intervention propranolol study . The two latter study find improvement outcome , remain 4 intervention find improvement regard PTSD , severity PTSD PTSSs . Another recent meta-analysis Kramer ( 2011 ) review early psychological intervention child adolescent single trauma include seven study ( two reappear mention review ) . These include CFTSI , school-based intervention , early psychological intervention , two intervention base exclusively psychoeducational information provision . The author conclude intervention effect regard PTSSs PTSD small non-significant found promise beneficial tendency regard dissociation , anxiety , extent , arousal . Overall , empirical literature support effectiveness early psychological intervention psychological debrief single-session psychological intervention prevent PTSD PTSSs child . These result consistent Cochrane review Rose 2002 effect psychological debrief prevent PTSD adult . However , school-based family-focused intervention , well stepped-procedure multiple-session psychological intervention show promising result . In conclusion , current outcomes empirical research suggest early intervention include follow elements31 : age-appropriate psychoeducation , provision individual coping skill , parental involvement , social support , risk-assessment , multiple session trauma exposure . The modest result early psychological intervention suggest need broad perspective preventive intervention child adolescent expose nonrelational trauma . Despite variety intervention evaluate study include two cited review none study focus practice health care professional . This study first conduct control trial standardize preventive intervention conduct health care professional . The intervention evaluate study include mention empirically supported element except multiple session trauma exposure . Trauma-informed health care The concept trauma-informed practice advocate institution researcher diverse area psychology , mental health care , education , child welfare , first responder , juvenile justice , health care . The main aim trauma-informed practice create systematic approach within area develop evidence-based service address impact trauma child serve37 . This study provide evidence impact practice HCPs symptom , cop social functioning child , adolescent family expose nonrelational trauma . It investigate effect educate HCPs trauma-informed practice effect standardize trauma-informed plan action implement health care department work child adolescent . Design trial This study design control trial one active intervention one comparison . The study conduct across 19 health care department 7 hospital Capitol Region Denmark . There two measurement occasion : one assessment 4 week exposure one follow-up 6 month exposure . The trial run 18 month . During first 12 month intervention run 12 participate department 8 department function control group . During last 6 month intervention run nineteen department thus expand sample size intervention group . Since intervention carry health care professional shortly exposure , child control group receive intervention point . Because intervention investigate trial conduct HCPs integrated part general practice ( oppose specific treatment program ) , neither practically possible ethically sound design allocation participant control intervention group randomization subject . For reason , allocation do , subject level , level department . This preclude actual randomization trial . However , note allocation department do intervention thus prior recruitment participant . This mean allocation subject predetermine advance admission hospital . This prevent bias associate lack randomization . In allocation department best possible match patient group pursue . It hypotheses study : The child adolescent receive intervention , compare participant control group , demonstrate great reduction posttraumatic stress , anxiety depressive symptom higher rating positive cognitive coping skill social functioning . Sample Size Power Calculation Given first trial examine effect trauma-informed intervention conduct HCPs part general health care practice , calculation power limit . Furthermore , effect size relate trial early psychological intervention intervention base information provision small non-significant . Given limitation , however , calculation power conduct basis available evidence . Results study Kenardy et al . ( 2008 ) information-provision intervention effect size 0.63 ( group ) child anxiety . In similar study Cox et al . ( 2010 ) effect size child anxiety 0.33 . Based result Cox et al . ( 2010 ) power analysis reveal 115 family per group ( N = 230 ) result 80 % power detect significant difference intervention control group 5 % significance level . However , estimate 25 % attrition rate assessment time period , total 290 family aim recruit study . Another power analysis conduct calculate power give specific sample size . This do participate department require include eligible family present department intervention period . It estimate department would receive two eligible participant per month . Because difference size intervention group control result sample size 516 intervention group 168 control group ( N = 684 ) . With estimate 25 % attrition rate number amount 387 intervention group 126 control group ( N = 513 ) . A post hoc power calculation result 94 % power effect size 0.33 5 % significance level . Statistical Considerations Prior statistical analysis outcome , control group intervention group compare pre-intervention equivalence demographic information type PTE . If significant difference identify , take account include variable covariates outcome analysis . The outcome data analyse report term statistical significance difference intervention control group change time outcome , clinical significance change , effect size . The analysis perform researcher involve assess eligibility participant , collection data enter data . Primary analysis undertaken intention-to-treat ( ITT ) basis , include participant receive intervention register control group , regardless withdrawal study . The data analyse mixed effect model , able include participant whose data may partly miss . Analysis covariance conduct three pair outcome : 1 ) child parent outcome , 2 ) symptom outcome cop outcome , 3 ) symptom outcome social functioning outcome . Other outcomes demographic type PTE describe .</detailed_description>
