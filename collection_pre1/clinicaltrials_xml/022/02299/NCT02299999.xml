	<detailed_description>Screening phase : New frozen biopsy archive frozen sample send genomic plateforms DNA extraction genomic analysis ( DNA microarrays Next generation sequence ) . Patients consider pre-eligible target substudy 1 randomisation phase follow mandatory condition meet : stable respond disease observe ( investigator judgment ) 6 8 cycle chemotherapy ( least 4 cycle chemotherapy stop toxicity ) targetable alteration identify Molecular Tumor Board ( MTB ) . If eligible substudy 1 randomisation phase , patient consider pre-eligible immune substudy 2 randomization phase follow mandatory condition meet : stable respond disease ( investigator judgment ) observe 6 8 cycle chemotherapy ( least 4 cycle treatment stop due toxicity ) AND eligible randomization substudy 1 ( patient targetable alteration identify Molecular Tumor Board , fail genomic profile tumor [ low tumor cell percentage , technical issue genomic analysis , etc . ] , non inclusion criterion preclude entry substudy 1 ) Randomization phase : The mandatory post-chemotherapy wash-out period , 28 day 21 28 day-cycle chemotherapy 15 day weekly ( except monoclonal antibody ) daily chemotherapy , provide time achieve require test examination . The randomization program allocate follow treatment 2:1 ratio favor Arm A consider substudy : Substudy 1 : target therapy versus standard maintenance chemotherapy - Arm A1 / target arm : targeted maintenance list 8 target drug ( see Appendix 5 - List medication target ) guide genomic analysis , - Arm B1 / chemotherapy arm : maintenance chemotherapy ( antineoplastic treatment case toxicity time randomization ) Substudy 2 : immunotherapy versus standard maintenance chemotherapy - Arm A2 / immunotherapy maintenance arm : MEDI4736 - Arm B2 / chemotherapy arm : chemotherapy continue maintenance chemotherapy ( antineoplastic treatment case toxicity )</detailed_description>
