	<brief_summary>Increased daytime activity child adolescents type I diabetes know associated overnight hypoglycemia . We therefore wish perform prospective clinical study ass feasibility use activity monitor data adjust insulin pump basal rate see whether help prevent overnight hypoglycemia follow high activity day . We plan carry enrol 20 subject ( 10 subject 1 &lt; 7 year old 10 subject 7 17 year old ) type 1 diabetes manage insulin pump therapy wear activity monitor CGMs 3 month . After initial two-week period establish activity baseline , recommend nighttime basal insulin rate adjustment base activity monitor , CGM insulin pump data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study pilot trial investigate feasibility use activity monitoring data adjust insulin pump therapy prevent hypoglycemia . The study enroll 20 patient type 1 diabetes mellitus insulin pump therapy , 10 two age group : young child age 1 year &lt; 7 year age , old child age 7-17 year age . Subjects provide continuous glucose monitor ( DexCom G4 ) activity monitor . Study duration 3 month . During course study patient continue receive routine care primary endocrinologist diabetes nurse educator ( DNE ) . Insulin dose adjustment unrelated activity monitor data continue discretion patient 's primary diabetes team . Activity level ( steps calorie burn ) upload web secure fashion central firewall-protected database daily basis CGM glucose value insulin pump data collect week . The initial 2 week subject 's enrollment study use establish baseline activity level change insulin regimen make base activity monitor data . During week 3 12 , activity data review daily alternate basal insulin rate recommend day consider increased activity day . We use adaptive algorithm help guide suggested insulin basal rate change . All recommendation review approved physician prior implementation . The alternate rate derive use subject 's usual care pump setting initial start point make incremental change 3 hour interval lead hypoglycemic event . Target overnight nadir obtain usual care setting . Residual error ( CGM-target ) use assess validity use 3 hour window prior event effect low basal .</detailed_description>
