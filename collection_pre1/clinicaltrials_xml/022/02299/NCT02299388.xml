	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct research study effect Liraglutide blood pressure . Several study show increase cardiovascular complication death diabetic hypertension . The importance blood pressure control diabetes show many clinical trial . No drug already approve treat Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus know reduce blood pressure along improve diabetes . However , prior research study liraglutide suggest treatment liraglutide improve blood pressure . This effect see quickly even prior weight loss . The mechanism behind effect yet determine . Blood pressure monitor use 24 hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure monitor : device monitor blood pressure continue normal activity . We choose method monitor blood pressure prior study prove superior single blood pressure record ability well predict clinical outcome . It well know diabetes hypertension cause endothelial dysfunction . Endothelium inner line blood vessel . When functioning , suppose regulate blood clotting , help body 's immune response , control volume fluid substance pass blood vessel . Hence , normal endothelial function protects blood vessel atherosclerosis ( harden ) build plaque . When function well ( diabetes , hypertension , cigarette smoker etc . ) perform one function . Hence , study , also measure endothelial function use machine : ENDO PAT . This non-invasive diagnostic test do doctor 's office . Usually take 15 minute . It painful . It generate EndoScore indicates current state endothelial health . This PILOT study ( small-scale study design determine large , full-scale study doable ) prove effect proven extend large , multicenter trial . Of note : Liraglutide already approve treat Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus .</detailed_description>
