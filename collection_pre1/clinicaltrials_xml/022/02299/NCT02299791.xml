	<detailed_description>The ALL Initiative ( 'ALL ' ) population-level management program develop Kaiser Permanente ( KP ) . It seek decrease cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity mortality patient diabetes improve rate prescribe guideline-concordant cardioprotective medication . Multiple mechanism support intervention KP . The investigator implement ALL 11 Community Health Centers ( CHC ) Portland , Oregon metropolitan area . To knowledge , first clinical trial test translation implementation successful quality improvement ( QI ) initiative private , integrate care set CHCs . The investigator adapt ALL intervention CHCs iterative , stakeholder-driven process . The investigator conduct cluster-randomized pragmatic trial 11 CHCs stagger process six 'early ' CHCs implement intervention one year five 'late ' CHCs . The investigator measure monthly rate cardioprotective prescribing rate . Through segment regression analysis , investigator evaluate intervention 's effect June 2011-May 2013 . Participants include 11 CHCs serve ~6,500 adult patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) indicate cardioprotective medication per national guideline . The investigator also conduct process evaluation identify factor important implementation success . Our overarch goal identify resolve issue disseminate successful program large , well-organized health system CHCs . The investigator hypothesize cross-setting translation feasible , adapt implement proven QI approach could improve care CHCs provide without require develop native initiative . The investigator anticipate implementation would involve substantially adapt potentially 'translatable ' practice intervention , due difference private , integrate care setting CHCs term patient need vulnerability , system resource .</detailed_description>
