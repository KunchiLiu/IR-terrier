	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose selinexor give together etoposide without mitoxantrone hydrochloride cytarabine treat patient acute myeloid leukemia return ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Selinexor may help stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cancer cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving chemotherapy together selinexor work well treat relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability selinexor combination mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , cytarabine ( MEC ) oral etoposide ( respective cohort independent ) patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . II . To define specific toxicity , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combination . III . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate duration complete remission ( CR ) ± hematologic recovery selinexor plus MEC therapy AML . II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) . III . To define rate complete remission ( CR + CR incomplete blood count recovery [ CRi ] ) rate end induction therapy . IV . Determine disease-free survival patient reach CR/CRi within 1 year . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct pharmacodynamic study measure effect chemotherapy combination inhibition exportin 1 ( XPO1 ) . II . To conduct pharmacokinetic sample selinexor etoposide limited time point assess drug metabolism , peak plasma level area curve ( AUC ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study selinexor . Patients assign 1 2 cohort . COHORT A ( PATIENTS FIT FOR INTENSIVE THERAPY , AGE &lt; 60 ) : Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , etoposide IV , cytarabine IV daily ( QD ) day 1-6 selinexor orally ( PO ) day 1 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 17 . Treatment continue 1 course ( 28 day ) . Further treatment base disease response . Patients achieve CR/CRi evaluate stem cell transplant ; patient proceed transplant may receive selinexor monotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT B ( PATIENTS UNFIT FOR INTENSIVE THERAPY , AGE ≥ 60 ) : Patients receive etoposide PO QD day 1-5 selinexor PO day 1 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 17 . Treatment may repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve response 4 course discontinue treatment ; patient achieve response may receive 4 course maintenance therapy every 8 week . Patients may continue selinexor monotherapy discretion principal investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
