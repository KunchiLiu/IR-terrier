	<brief_summary>Over one million hospitalization acute heart failure ( AHF ) occur every year United States , result high mortality , re-hospitalizations , incur financial cost ; yet nearly every attempt last 10 year improve outcomes novel therapy fail . In proposal , study whether generic drug know mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ( commonly know aldosterone blocker ) , proven reduce morbidity mortality chronic heart failure patient , safe feasible give AHF patient emergency department hospitalization total 3 day . The result study provide necessary sufficient data design efficacy study large population test whether early use high-dose mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce post-discharge morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Aldosterone Blockade Acute Heart Failure : An Exploratory Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial pilot study - Early Aldosterone Blockade Acute Heart Failure : An Exploratory Safety Study - explore safety early mineralocorticoid receptor blockade high-dose spironolactone ( 100mg/daily ) , oral mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , versus placebo ( addition standard therapy ) , patient admit acute heart failure ( AHF ) 3 day . Aim 1 answer critical question early mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) antagonism AHF patient sufficiently safe move forward definitive trial . Aim 2 demonstrate feasibility patient enrollment compliance treatment throughout study inform future study design enrollment projection . This study provide necessary sufficient data order plan large , simple , definitive trial test hypothesis early aldosterone blockade AHF patient reduce mortality 30-day readmission . The primary endpoint pilot study difference incidence mean change serum potassium specific amount baseline 120 hour initial dose placebo vs. spironolactone treat subject .</detailed_description>
