	<criteria>COPD diagnosis severity : Participants clinical history COPD ( establish physician ) accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society , least 6 month prior enrolment . Participants must evidence airflow obstruction , define postbronchodilator FEV1 equal less 80 % predict normal value calculate use `` Third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey '' ( NHANES III ) reference equation Visit 1 FEV1 / FVC ratio &lt; =70 % Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Note : Postbronchodilator spirometry perform approximately 1015 minute participant selfadministered 4 inhalation ( i.e. , total 400/360 [ microgram ] mcg ) salbutamol/albuterol via Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) ( use spacer optional ) . The studyprovided central spirometry equipment calculate FEV1/FVC ratio FEV1 percent predict value . Exacerbation History : A documented history ( e.g. , medical record verification ) 12 month prior Visit 1 &gt; =2 COPD exacerbation result prescription antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid hospitalisation extend observation hospital emergency room outpatient centre . Note : Prior use antibiotic alone qualify moderate exacerbation unless use specifically treatment worsen symptom COPD . Existing COPD maintenance treatment : Participants must receive daily maintenance treatment COPD least 3 month prior Screening . Notes : Participants receive `` pro nata '' need ( PRN ) COPD medication eligible inclusion study . All participant continue current Standard Care ( SoC ) COPD medication throughout entire duration study . Tobacco use : Participants current prior history &gt; =10 packyears cigarette smoke Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . One pack year =20 cigarette smoke per day 1 year equivalent . Number pack years= ( number cigarette per day/20 ) x number year smoke . Sex : Male female participant age &gt; =40 year Screening ( Visit 1 ) . A female participant eligible participate nonchild bear potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit/milliliter ( MIU/mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/milliliter ( pg/mL ) ( &lt; 140 [ Picomoles per liter ] pmol/L ) confirmatory ] childbearing potential use highly effective method avoidance pregnancy 30 day first dose , duration dose 2 week post lastdose . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Corrected ECG QT interval ( QTc ) &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &lt; 480 msec participant bundle branch block . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord either Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , another method , machine manual overread . For eligibility withdrawal , ideally QT correction formula use participant . However , always possible , QT correction formula use individual participant determine eligibility withdrawal study . The QTc base single average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period . Eosinophils : &gt; 2.0 % blood eosinophil Screening ( Visit 1 ) Concomitant medication : COPD Medication : Participants currently chronic treatment macrolides Roflumilast ; Long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen PRN use ( i.e . &lt; =12 hour per day ) exclusionary . Multidrug toxin extrusion ( MATE ) transporter 1 ( MATE1 ) inhibitor : cimetidine , pyrimethamine , trimethoprim ( short course treatment trimethoprim allow ) .

Any investigational drug within 30 day 5 half life , whichever long prior Screening Visit . Other respiratory disorder : Participants asthma ( primary diagnosis ) lung cancer , bronchiectasis , active sarcoidosis , active lung fibrosis , cystic fibrosis , idiopathic pulmonary hypertension , active interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Participants alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Participants clinically significant sleep apnea require use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device . Participants require noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) device ( Note : Use non invasive ventilation ( NIV ) hospital part medical management acute exacerbation permit . ) Lung resection : Participants undergo previous lung reduction surgery ( e.g . lobectomy , pneumonectomy , lung volume reduction ) . COPD stability : Less 30 day prior Visit 1 elapsed completion course antibiotic oral corticosteroid recent COPD exacerbation . Evidence pneumonia clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD chest Xray ( posteroanterior lateral ) computerise tomography ( CT ) scan ( historic data 1 year may use ) . Pulmonary rehabilitation program : Participation acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Participants maintenance phase pulmonary rehabilitation program exclude . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) .
