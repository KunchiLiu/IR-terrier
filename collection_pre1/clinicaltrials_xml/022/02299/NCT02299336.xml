	<brief_summary>The Endurance Trial phase IV open label clinical study ass need ongoing intravitreal aflibercept injection 3-year VISTA DME ( VGFT-OD-1009 ) end-point . Subjects treat intravitreal aflibercept injection pro nata ( PRN ) base presence CR-DME ( Clinically Relevant-DME ) . In addition , subject meet re-treatment criterion eligible focal laser treatment every 90 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Efficacy &amp; Safety Aflibercept IVT Treatment DME Subjects Who Completed VISTA-DME Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational product aflibercept , supply Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc. sterile vial intravitreal ( IVT ) injection . Vials must use ( define enter needle ) . All drug supply keep recommended storage condition . The injection volume 50μL ( 0.05 mL ) administer subject IVT injection . Throughout trial , subject treat intravitreal aflibercept injection PRN presence CR-DME ; define DME treat investigator believe limit visual function . All subject initially evaluate every 4 week ( 28 day ) CR-DME treat PRN . If CR-DME present subject receive IVT aflibercept injection . If CR-DME present subject receive IVT aflibercept injection observe . At point throughout study , subject evaluate observed ( IVT aflibercept ) total 8 week ( 3 consecutive monthly visit ) , interval visit increase 8 week . After additional 24 week ( 3 consecutive visit , every 8 week ) without IVT aflibercept injection , interval visit increase 12 week . If subject recurrent CR-DME receive IVT aflibercept injection interval visit reduce back 4 week . Subjects extend interval visit 8 week receive IVT aflibercept injection total 8 week ( 3 consecutive visit ) describe . Extension 12 week perform . Starting week 52 , subject extend 12 week interval , CR-DME present subject receive IVT aflibercept injection extend 16 week interval . Once 16 week interval , CR-DME present subject receive IVT aflibercept injection extend 20 week interval . At point past 12 week interval extension , subject recurrent CR-DME receive IVT aflibercept injection interval next visit reduce investigator discretion either 12 16 week . If interval need reduced 12 week , subject return 4 8 week interval , investigator discretion return protocol . All subject receive PRN IVT aflibercept injection evaluate focal laser treatment begin week 12 end study . If subject meet criteria focal laser treatment ( FLT ) , fluorescein angiography ( FA ) perform guide focal laser treatment . Focal laser treatment focal laser re-treatment administer every 90 day . When subject receive ≥ 2 IVT aflibercept injection ≤ 24 week FLT apply . Once initial session FLT apply subject eligible FLT re-treatment 90 day , receive ≥ 2 IVT aflibercept injection within prior 90 day period . FLT apply : 1 . All leaking microaneurysms . 2 . Grid area diffuse leakage . 3 . Grid area retinal ischemia outside FAZ ( ischemic area treat grid FLT , area treat ) . 4 . Laser apply within capillary FAZ . FLT apply follow apply identify : 1 . Significant macular ischemia involve foveal avascular zone ( determine additional fluorescein angiography FLT planning perform subject longer eligible rescue FLT ) . 2 . Treatment would close foveal avascular zone . 3 . Macular edema relate DME ( eg : postoperative CME , etc ) .</detailed_description>
