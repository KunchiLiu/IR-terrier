	<brief_summary>There limited benefit angiogenesis inhibitor drug use molecularly select patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The investigator propose patient molecularly select treatment nintedanib base presence mutation ( VEGFR1-3 , PDGFR-A , PDGFR-B , FGFR1-3 ) clinically meaningful benefit term response rate ( RR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Furthermore investigator plan perform exome sequencing pair tumor ( pre post treatment ) order well define molecular marker predictor response resistance .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis advance ( metastatic unresectable ) NSCLC mutation , rearrangement fusion involve RET oncogene , abnormality ( nonsynonymous SNV amplification ) nintedanib target gene VEGFR13 , TP53 , PDGFRA , PDGFRB , FGFR13 . Patients EGFR mutation ALK rearrangement must disease progression appropriate FDAapproved therapy genomic aberration prior enrollment . Disease progression platinumdoublet chemotherapy prior enrollment . At least one measurable lesion evaluable disease . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm CT scan , ≥20 mm chest xray , ≥10 mm caliper clinical exam . Prior treatment cancer ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery ) allow complete least 3 week prior start treatment nintedanib treatmentrelated toxicity resolve . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status 01 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL INR &lt; 2.0 PT PTT &lt; 50 % deviation IULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 1.5 x IULN patient without liver metastasis ≤ 2.5 x IULN patient liver metastasis Urine protein &lt; 2+ Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month end treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Prior treatment VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent , receive investigational agent within 3 week first dose nintedanib . Radiotherapy target lesion within past 3 month prior baseline image . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis eligible metastasis asymptomatic previously treat . Leptomeningeal disease . Radiographic evidence cavitary necrotic tumor . Centrally locate tumor radiographic evidence ( CT MRI ) local invasion major blood vessel . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition nintedanib agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II , active coronary artery disease , unstable angina pectoris , serious cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension ( define systolic pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ) , pericardial effusion , uncontrolled seizure disorder , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Major injury and/or surgery past 4 week prior start study treatment incomplete wound heal and/or plan surgery ontreatment study period . History clinically significant hemorrhagic thromboembolic event past 6 month . Known inherited predisposition bleed thrombosis . History cardiac infarction within past 12 month prior start study treatment . Receiving therapeutic anticoagulation ( except lowdose heparin and/or heparin flush need maintenance indwell intravenous device ) antiplatelet therapy ( except lowdose therapy acetylsalicylic acid &lt; 325 mg QD ) . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patients childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Significant weight loss ( &gt; 10 % BW ) within past 6 month prior inclusion trial . Known active chronic hepatitis B C infection . Active alcohol drug abuse . Gastrointestinal disorder abnormality would interfere absorption study drug . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction nintedanib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
