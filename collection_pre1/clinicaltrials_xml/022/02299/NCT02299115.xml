	<detailed_description>Background Rationale study : Infantile spasm ( IS ) rare , catastrophic age-specific epilepsy syndrome onset within first 12 month life . The disorder characterize clinically epileptic spasm , often accompany developmental regression characteristic interictal electroencephalography ( EEG ) pattern call hypsarrhythmia . When three feature present , term , `` West syndrome '' commonly use . The catastrophic nature disorder due frequent sequela severe global neurodevelopmental delay medically refractory epilepsy . The initial age onset 90 % case occur 12 month life , peak onset 6 month . The incidence 2 3 per 10,000 live birth lifetime prevalence 1.5 2 per 10,000 child . It slightly common male , family history exist 3 % -6 % cases.1,2,3 The etiology IS conventionally divide symptomatic cryptogenic , depend whether underlie cause know . Conditions cause symptomatic IS diverse include focal multifocal brain injury , chromosomal abnormality genetic mutation inborn error metabolism . In 20 % case , identifiable cause remain unknown define cryptogenic . The spontaneous remission rate IS limited natural history study 30 % .4,5 Although clinical spasm typical EEG pattern disappear 3 4 year age , 60 % child IS go develop type refractory seizure , include Lennox Gastaut syndrome . The poor developmental outcome IS primarily due underlie etiology , however , delay diagnosis treatment6 use ineffective therapy also contributory factor . The hypsarrhythmia EEG pattern pattern epileptic encephalopathy evidence long duration epileptic encephalopathy contributes developmental delay development autism , especially infants Down syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) .7,8 Currently , still considerable variation management IS , evidence US Consensus Report recent survey do current evaluation treatment IS among member Child Neurology Society ( CNS ) . Most neurologist use adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) prefer , first-line treatment IS , cause TSC Vigabatrin ( VGB ) first-line treatment IS cause TSC . 9,10 The 2004 American Academy Neurology ( AAN ) CNS practice parameter medical treatment IS 2012 update evidenced-based guideline conclude ACTH VGB may useful short-term treatment IS , ACTH effective VGB exclude case TSC . 11,12 The 2012 update also conclude insufficient evidence determine whether form corticosteroid effective ACTH . There also insufficient evidence recommend agent , combination therapy short-term treatment IS . Although many condition cause IS , several hypothesis regard underlie mechanism propose . The corticotrophin release hormone ( CRH ) hypothesis one study . Children IS , common characteristic excessive release CRH . Elevated CRH cause seizures neuronal death within hippocampus amygdala immature brain animal study . Elevated CRH also cause desensitization CRH receptor lead decreased ACTH release result reduce ACTH level cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . ACTH treatment , likely suppresses excessive production CRH via direct action melanocortin receptor elicit antiepileptic effect.13 Prednisolone primary metabolite synthetic glucocorticoid , prednisone . Corticosteroids reduce hippocampal excitability vitro , increase gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) antagonize 5-hydroxytryptophan.14 VGB irreversible , enzyme-activated , selective inhibitor GABA-transaminase . By inhibit catabolism , increased availability GABA within synaptic cleft , increase inhibitory effect.15 The mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway key signal pathway dysregulated TSC . Animal study show VGB partially inhibit mTOR pathway activity glial proliferation knock-out mouse vitro , well reduce mTOR pathway activation culture astrocytes knock-out control mouse . This may account unique efficacy VGB TSC.16 At institution , VGB prefer first-line treatment newly diagnose IS due relative ease use few acute adverse event compare ACTH . However , concern regard retinal toxicity17 require regular monitoring electroretinogram ( ERGs ) perform sedation.18 Also , VGB-related MRI change see 22-32 % child treat IS although change mostly asymptomatic may resolve even VGB continue , concern change reflect medication-related neurotoxic effect.19,20 For patient fail VGB , use 6-week course synthetic ACTH ( Synacthen ) give intramuscularly ( IM ) every day second-line agent . However , associate significant adverse event , include infection immunosuppression , arterial hypertension , weight gain , severe irritability , gastric irritation , hyperglycemia , electrolyte disturbance , cerebral atrophy , behavioral change . The United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study ( UKISS ) demonstrate superiority hormonal therapy VGB cessation spasms 14 day infant without TSC . The hormonal therapy arm include patient allocate high-dose oral prednisolone intramuscular ACTH study show prednisolone effective ACTH.21 Because Class 3 study provide evidence oral prednisolone first-line treatment IS , prospective study need . Since 2010 , Hospital Sick Children ( SickKids ) start provide option either IM ACTH high-dose oral prednisolone second-line treatment patient fail VGB . Our previous retrospective case review twenty IS patient fail 2-week course VGB show 80 % response rate ( 12/15 ) ACTH 20 % ( 1/5 ) prednisolone . 22 . This seemingly low response prednisolone may due underlie etiology , make condition refractory VGB first place . Since UKISS paper publish , many institution US Australia use oral prednisolone instead ACTH , partly due exorbitant cost intramuscular ACTH ( US $ 70,000 per course natural ACTH ) also ease use good adverse event profile compare ACTH.23,24 A retrospective case series 17 newly diagnose IS give high-dose oral prednisolone first-line treatment show clinical response 100 % cryptogenic group , 64 % symptomatic ( non-TSC ) group.24 A retrospective case series 27 newly diagnose IS give high dose prednisolone ( 8mg/kg/day ) maximum daily dose 60 mg show 63 % response rate ( 17/27 ) prednisolone within 2 week . 25 The selection start dose 4 week , duration treatment base previous study , use dose range 4-8 mg/kg/day 8mg/kg/day respectively 4 - 6 week duration therapy . 21.23.24.25 . We elect use high end dose range previously report ensure maximum efficacy , short length 4 week treatment reduce risk medication side effect . The relapse rate infantile spasm retrospective study range 12-40 % , time relapse 2-25 month . 24,25 . We envisage use long-term treatment recurrent intermittent treatment prednisolone . Prednisolone VGB oral medication , initiate promptly upon diagnosis IS , expedite treatment shorten treatment lag time . We propose oral prednisolone may effective VGB use first-line treatment newly diagnose non-TSC IS patient . Objective study : Aim To compare efficacy prednisolone VGB 1st line short-term treatment IS measure clinical EEG response 2 week . Hypothesis : More patient allocate prednisolone therapy cessation spasm resolution hypsarrhythmia 2 week . METHODS : Study design : Single center , prospective , observational , open trial use high-dose oral prednisolone first-line treatment newly diagnose IS ( non-Tuberous Sclerosis ) , follow 2 week , end treatment 5 month later . All patient undergo thorough history , physical neurological examination , metabolic , genetic , EEG neuroimaging study per Hospital Sick Children ( HSC ) Infantile Spasms Guidelines . 25 These patient compare historical control , compose cohort non-TSC IS patient January 2010- September 2013 receive VGB first-line treatment , meet inclusion criterion follow least 6 month diagnosis treatment initiation . The patient family obligation involve study continue receive care primary neurologist choose participate study . Study Duration : The length study patient approximately 6 month . The total duration study estimate 3 year . Sample size : A sample population 70 patient retrospective VGB cohort 35 patient prospective Prednisolone cohort 2:1 match require demonstrate statistically significant difference efficacy 25 % Prednisolone Vigabatrin . Patient Population : Children age 2-24 month clinical spasm hypsarrhythmia modify hypsarrhythmia initial EEG refer outpatient Neurology clinic Sickkids . Control Population : Historical control compose cohort non-TSC IS patient 2010-2013 received VGB first-line treatment fulfill inclusion criterion study .</detailed_description>
