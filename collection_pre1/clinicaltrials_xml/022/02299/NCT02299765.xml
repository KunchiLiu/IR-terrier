	<brief_summary>Study Title : Intercalating maintenance Gefitinib combination chemotherapy ( gemcitabine plus carboplatin ) first-line treatment patient advance EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer : A randomized , open-label , multiple-centre study . Target population-Treatment naive EGFR mutant-positive advance NSCLC patient . Study Objectives - Primary Study Objective : To investigate whether intercalate maintenance Gefitinib combination chemotherapy improve Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) vs. Gefitinib alone advance NSCLC EGFR activate mutation . - Secondary Study Objective： To evaluate whether intercalate maintenance Gefitinib combination chemotherapy improve Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) , Disease control rate ( DCR ) , Overall survival ( OS ) , 2-year OS rate , QOL vs. Gefitinib alone . Evaluation safety Intercalating Maintenance Gefitinib combination chemotherapy . - Exploratory objective : PFS arm A vs. PFS 1 + PFS 2 arm B Dynamic biomarker analysis use blood sample : The PFS 1 arm B time randomization disease progression 1st-line therapy death cause , whichever occur first . The PFS 2 arm B time time PFS 1 disease progression 2nd-line therapy death cause , whichever occur first . Study Design-Prospective , open-label , randomize , multi-center study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : It two-arm , prospective , randomize , open-label , multi-center study . The study conduct 5 study site China . West China Hospital serve lead site study . A total 146 treatment naive EGFR mutant positive advanced NSCLC patient plan enrol study . There four period study : baseline period ( ≤28days ) , main phase treatment ( Week 0-Week 16 disease progression ) , post-treatment period follow-up 24 month last patient enrolment . 1 . Baseline period : Subject enrol study signing inform consent form ( ICF ) . Investigator record patient-reported outcome , demographic data medical history , collect histological cytological sample genetic testing , conduct laboratory examination perform image examination . Notes : The time imagination effective within 4 week treatment . The result haematology , biochemistry physical examination effective within 7 day treatment . Collecting blood one time screen period ( The SOP blood collection , storage transportation attachment 1 ) . 2 . Main phase treatment : There 8 visit main phase treatment study . During main phase treatment , investigator conduct laboratory examination , perform image examination , assess tumor status , evaluate patient-reported outcome safety . Collecting blood one time every two cycle ( The SOP blood collection , storage transportation attachment 1 ) . 3 . Post-treatment period : In study group , investigator conduct laboratory examination , perform image examination , assess tumor status , evaluate patient-reported outcome safety disease progression every 8 week . And disease progression investigator enquire record survival status subject every 8 week . In control group , investigator conduct laboratory examination , perform image examination , assess tumor status , evaluate patient-reported outcome safety first second disease progression every 8 week . In addition , information conduct first disease progression second progression optional , collect available . And second disease progression investigator enquire record survival status subject every 8 week . Collecting blood one time every 8 week progress ( control group first progress ) 4 . Follow-up period : It last 24 month last patient ' enrolment . Accesses histological cytological sample EGFR test related drug resistant gene testing require . In addition , collection blood optional , collect available . All sample collect his/her whole life treatment transport West China Hospital store use exploratory analysis later . All result CT/MRI need burn compact disc ( CD ) . This study first study compare efficacy intercalate maintenance gefitinib combination chemotherapy gefitinib alone first-line treatment patient advance EGFR activate mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
