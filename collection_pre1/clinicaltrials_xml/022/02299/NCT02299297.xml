	<brief_title>Study To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Tofacitinib In Moderate To Severe Alopecia Areata , Totalis And Universalis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) common disease immune system , know `` autoimmune '' disease . In disease , immune system mistakenly destroy hair follicle , cause hair fall . Despite many people disease , research cause new , good way treat AA lag far behind similar disease immune system . Currently , Federal Drug Administration approve drug AA . Tofacitinib ( make Pfizer ) intervention know effectively treat disease joint , know rheumatoid arthritis . It also study treatment psoriasis , another `` autoimmune '' disease , fight inflammation . There genetic chemical similarity active rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , AA , suggest treatment drug likely effective . In mouse specially design test drug treatment human alopecia , medication work prevent disease AA start mouse would otherwise developed disease . To test Tofacitinib , go treat 15 patient moderate severe AA 6 month . This `` open label '' study , mean placebo group ; patient enrol study receive active medication . The effectiveness medication measure change hair re-growth determined physical exam photography , well patient physician scoring . After treatment period 6 month complete , There option increase treatment duration additional 6 month beyond initially schedule 6 month treatment , clinically indicate , discretion investigator . Patients follow another 6 month drug see effect treatment last delayed response . The safety medication , Tofacitinib , patient AA also evaluate . Blood work collect medication start , treatment period Tofacitinib stop order monitor adverse effect medication . Small scalp biopsy peripheral blood take begin study treatment week 4 24 . Additional , optional scalp biopsy blood draw may suggest important time point . The chemical analysis skin sample blood help u understand disease happen , treatment work , even guide u good treatment future .</detailed_description>

Patients &gt; 30 % &lt; 95 % total scalp hair loss baseline measure use SALT score qualify moderate severe patch type AA ; 95100 % scalp hair loss qualify alopecia totalis universalis . Duration hair loss great 3 month without upper limit duration long reason believe regrowth possible opinion investigator . No evidence significant active ongoing regrowth present baseline . Patients history alopecia totalis/universalis include long current episode hair loss meet criteria 30 95 % hair loss ( i.e . currently AT AU ) , long opinion investigator appear potential regrowth . Patients current episode alopecia totalis/universalis may include study . Vaccinations date agreement current immunization guideline prior start tofacitinib . The patient ask obtain verbal verification primary care provider case . Patients may na√Øve treatment unresponsive intralesional ( IL ) steroids treatment alopecia areata . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use highly effective method birth control [ least 12 week last dose investigational product ] minimize risk pregnancy . WOCBP must follow instruction birth control entire duration study include minimum 90 day dose complete . Acceptable method highly effective birth control include : Condom spermicide Diaphragm spermicide Cervical cap spermicide The use intrauterine device , ( IUDs ) shall discretion investigator . 1 . Women must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start investigational product . 2 . Women must breastfeed .

Women pregnant breastfeeding . 4 . Women positive pregnancy test enrollment administration tofacitinib . 5 . Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control partner WOCBP . Target Disease Exceptions 1 . Patients current alopecia totalis/universalis ( i.e . 100 % scalp 100 % scalp body loss , respectively ) may enrol . 2 . Patients history active skin disease scalp psoriasis seborrheic dermatitis . 3 . Patients diagnosis alopecia areata question pattern hair loss quantification hair loss assessment regrowth difficult . E.g patient diffuse alopecia areata . This assessment investigator 's discretion . 4 . Patients active medical condition malignancy ( except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma ) opinion investigator would increase risk associate study participation , include patient history recurrent infection . 5 . Patients hemoglobin level &lt; 9 g/dL , lymphocyte count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1000 cells/mm3 , baseline . 6 . Patients know HIV hepatitis B C positive . 7 . Patients history evidence moderate severe hepatic and/or renal impairment . 8 . Patients history immunosuppression history recurrent serious infection . Coexisting disease concurrent medication 1 . Patients take potent inhibitor Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( e.g.ketoconazole ) . 2 . Patients receive one concomitant medication result moderate inhibition CYP3A4 potent inhibition CYP2C19 ( e.g. , fluconazole ) . 3 . Patients know HIV hepatitis B C positive . 4 . Patients evidence infection active/untreated skin cancer . 5 . Patients treat intralesional steroid , systemic steroid , anthralin , squaric acid , DPCP ( diphenylcycloprophenone ) , protopic , minoxidil medication opinion investigator may affect hair regrowth within one month baseline visit . 6 . Patients impaired , incapacitated , incapable completing studyrelated assessment . 7 . Patients current symptom severe , progressive , uncontrolled renal , hepatic , hematologic , gastrointestinal , pulmonary , cardiac , neurologic , cerebral disease , , opinion investigator , might place subject unacceptable risk participation study . 8 . Female patient breast cancer screen suspicious malignancy possibility malignancy reasonably exclude additional clinical , laboratory , diagnostic evaluation . 9 . Patients history cancer last 5 year , nonmelanoma skin cell cancer cure local resection carcinoma situ . Existing nonmelanoma skin cell cancer remove , lesion site heal , residual cancer rule administration study drug . 10 . Patients currently abuse drug alcohol . 11 .

Subjects may receive live vaccine concurrently tofacitinib . 14 . Patients history symptom suggestive gastrointestinal perforation disorder might increase risk GI perforation gastric ulcer diverticulitis . 15 . Patients take NSAIDs high dose frequent basis , investigator 's opinion might increase risk gastrointestinal perforation . 16 . Patients serious bacterial infection within last 3 month , unless treat resolved antibiotic , chronic bacterial infection ( e.g. , chronic pyelonephritis , osteomyelitis , bronchiectasis ) . 17 .
