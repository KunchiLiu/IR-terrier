	<brief_summary>Despite robust multimodal pain management regimen , patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) continue report low satisfaction postoperative pain management . Patient satisfaction decline adverse event drug reaction neuroleptic medication patient fall due femoral nerve block . A new method pain management throughout hospital experience warrant improve patient satisfaction possibility related adverse event . The purpose study examine difference post operative pain morphine ( MSO4 ) total consumption hospitalize TKA patient without femoral nerve block receive intra-operative periarticular injection bupivacaine liposome suspension versus concentrate multi drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupivacaine Liposome Suspension Versus Concentrated Multi Drug Periarticular Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The void literature multimodal pain management reduces postoperative pain majority TKA patients6-14 , many still dissatisfy overall pain control13 adverse drug reaction ( dizziness somnolence ) neuroleptic medications15 . Additionally , postoperative fall great femoral nerve blocks16 , new neurological symptom associate block17 . Bupivacaine liposome suspension periarticular injection large scale national anecdotal support TKA pain control avoidance regional block adversity . There one recent randomize control trial TKA patient favorably compare periarticular injection bupivacaine liposome suspension versus bupivacaine hydrochloride ( HCL ) 5 . To date clinical use publish evidence robustly support bupivacaine liposome suspension patient undergo bunionectomy hemorrhoidectomy . Additionally , preparation shorter hospital stay total joint arthroplasty , effective well tolerate pain management solution need . Hypothesis Statement : Hospitalized TKA patient without pre-operative femoral nerve block experience improve postoperative pain control less MSO4 equivalence consumption receive injection bupivacaine liposome suspension versus concentrate multi drug .</detailed_description>
