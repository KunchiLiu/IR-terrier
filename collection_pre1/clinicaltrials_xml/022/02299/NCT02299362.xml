	<brief_title>The Treatment Progressive Early Onset Spinal Deformities : A Multi-Center Outcome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center study evaluate long-term clinical radiographic outcome Early Onset Scoliosis ( EOS ) Early Onset Spinal Chest Wall Deformities large population patient . The study attempt answer follow clinical question : 1 . How clinical parameter ( e.g . height , weight , pulmonary function , incidence complication ) differ : 1 . Age group 2 . Etiologic group 3 . Treatment type include operative non-operative method 4 . Patients receive definitive spinal fusion versus 2 . How radiographic parameter ( e.g . curve size , spinal height , thoracic dimension , sagittal profile , pelvic parameter , spinal balance ) differ : 1 . Age group 2 . Etiologic group 3 . Treatment type include operative non-operative method 4 . Patients receive definitive spinal fusion versus 3 . How health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , use EOSQ-24 outcome tool , differ : 1 . Age group 2 . Etiologic group 3 . Treatment type include operative non-operative method 4 . Patients receive definitive spinal fusion versus 4 . What demographic , clinical , radiographic , surgical factor contribute incidence complication ? 5 . For patient particular diagnosis , age and/or treatment type , clinical , radiographic HRQOL change treatment ? 6 . What mechanisms cause rod breakage grow rod construct ? ( This study question collaborative research study U.S. Food Drug Administration ) .</detailed_description>
