	<brief_summary>Therefore , purpose pilot study determine feasibility conduct randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) physical therapist treatment dizziness sports-related concussion . The specific research question pilot RCT : What feasibility conduct RCT athlete dizziness 10 great day sports-related concussion explore effectiveness direct vestibular rehabilitation , neuromotor retraining , and/or manual physical therapy ( PT ) compare sham treatment ? The finding study ( feasibility effect size ) use inform direct revision method large RCT population . Primary Aims : Specific Aim 1 : Assess feasibility follow : recruitment retention participant , required resource project management , assessment patient safety . Specific Aim 2 : Estimate size effect skilled physical therapist intervention sham treatment recovery rate athlete concussion dizziness 10 - 14 day post-concussion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : This study pilot feasibility study RCT , randomize individual level . Subjects : The population interest include athlete see physician Sports Medicine Center ( site Akron Children 's Hospital ( ACH ) proxy location , e.g . Walsh University North Canton Children 's Hospital Clinic ) sports-related concussion . The specific population interest concuss patient present medical assessment dizziness measure Post-Concussion Symptom Scale ( PCS ) . Sample Size Sampling : Because pilot study explore feasibility recruitment , retention method large RCT , sample intend power full scale study . It standard pilot study include least 12 participant per arm study , however , potential loss follow investigator plan enroll 20 subject per treatment group . Study Subject Selection Definitions : All patient present Sports Medicine Center acute concussion ( defined time event cause concussion 14 day concussion ) complete PCS . Within 22 item scale , 7 item specify physical symptom component migraine cluster . These symptom include : headache , visual problem , dizziness , noise-light sensitivity , nausea/vomiting , balance problem , numbness/tingling . Although dizziness primary patient complaint target , symptom within migraine cluster may also present addition dizziness may implicate cervical , proprioceptive , and/or vestibular injury . For reason , patient report symptom migraine cluster one follow criterion ask enroll study initial assessment : 1 . An initial score least 3 7 point Likert scale dizziness singular symptom OR 2 . A score 10 across 7 item within migraine cluster include complaint dizziness score least 1 7 point Likert scale OR 3 . If finding objective assessment conduct physician indicate postural/vestibular/ocular perception abnormal . Methods Allocation : At day10 concussion , patient enrol study initial medical visit contact e-mail Qualtrics ask complete PCS second time ( patient see medical provider Sports Medicine day 10 day 14 , do day ) . If day 10 - 14 concussion sustain , patient continue report dizziness score least 3 total score migraine cluster least 10 ( include score least 1 dizziness ) he/she randomize one treatment group use random allocation sequence generator . If patient meet threshold symptom day 10 - 14 , receive standard medical care Sports Medicine physicians randomize one PT treatment arm . One study investigator responsible assignment treatment group use 1:1 allocation ratio . Blinding : This study conduct double-blind trial whereby physicians sports-medicine center , patient participant , family blind treatment allocation ( sham skilled ) patient throughout study time . Blinding important limit study bias physician determine one key outcome , timeframe return play , athletes report second key outcome , symptom severity PCS . The PTs perform assessment treatment blind allocation patient deliver intervention . The therapist deliver treatment ( sham skilled ) base allocation . Because PTs blind allocation treatment , determine timeframe return play . Patient follow-up : All patient allocate one treatment arm follow 4 consecutive week release return play sport medicine physician . All patient continue follow physician sport medicine practice ( standard care ) . Patient safety : Because study challenge rest paradigm use progressive active treatment manage acute dizziness , without risk . Patients carefully monitor visit determine response treatment . Since sham treatment incorporate actual therapeutic activity , exacerbation symptom expect . The skilled treatment group pragmatic , allow treat therapist determine type aggressiveness treatment session . This give therapists ability modify activity use expert clinical judgment . For subject study , patient response PT session monitor begin PT treatment . If patient symptom increase therapy session , great standard error measure 6.3 point , treatment cease patient refer back Sports Medicine follow . All adverse event record .</detailed_description>
