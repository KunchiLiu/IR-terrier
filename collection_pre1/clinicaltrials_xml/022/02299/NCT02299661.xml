	<brief_summary>DS-1093a inhibitor hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases , expect produce transient dose / exposure dependent increase erythropoietin level subject chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . This study conduct 2 part . Part A involve subject stage 3b 4 CKD , open , non-controlled parallel group investigation three single dos DS-1093a ( 6 subjects/dose ) , allocation dose randomise . On completion part study optional fourth dose may test gain complete understand PK/PD behaviour DS-1093a . Part B open , non-controlled investigation single dose DS-1093a CKD subject ( n=6 ) receive haemodialysis . The dose Part B determine base data Part A .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 70 year ( inclusive ) . Female patient must nonchildbearing potential ( postmenopause surgical sterilization ) . In woman young 60 year folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) test conduct confirm postmenopausal status ( i.e. , FSH ≥ 30 mU/mL ) . Part A : CKD stage 3b ( eGFR : &lt; 45 ≥ 30 mL/min ) stage 4 ( eGFR : &lt; 30 ≥ 15 mL/min ) . The CKDEPI equation use eGFR estimation . Part B : Patients chronic haemodialysis least 6 month stable Hb level ( i.e. , +/ 1 g/dL ) last 6 month . Patient wash ESAs least 3 week ( 2 week prior dose 1 week postdose ) . Baseline Hb level ≥10 g/dL . Willingness give write consent participate reading ICF , opportunity discuss trial Investigator delegate . Male patient must willing use reliable method contraception trial , 4 month afterwards Use ESAs within 2 week prior dose . Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical therapy , define &gt; 160/100 mmHg 10 minute rest screening , &gt; 180/110 mmHg 10 minute rest Day 1 predose . Known haemoglobinopathy . Acute renal failure ( judged Investigator ) . History kidney transplant regardless functionality . Start new medication change current dosage within 7 day prior study drug administration . Chronic liver disease . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody test . Positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 HIV2 . A history gastrointestinal bleeding . History thrombotic event ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , stroke transient ischemic attack , peripheral embolism , venous thromboembolism , etc . ) Patients poorly control diabetes despite optimal medical therapy . A history cancer , except basal cell skin cancer , squamous cell skin cancer , cervical cancer ( judge Investigator full remission ) . Hypersensitivity component study drug . Requirement concomitant medication withhold Day 1 4 hour postdose ( insulin allow cover breakfast , necessary ) . Clinically relevant abnormal medical history , physical finding , ECG , laboratory value screen assessment could interfere objective trial safety patient . Participation another investigational drug trial within 30 day prior dose ( 5 time halflife drug , whichever long ) exposure three new investigational agent within 12 month prior enrolment . Abuse drug alcohol 2 year first dose trial medication . Ingestion alcohol within 72 hour prior dose confinement . Outside inhouse period , regular alcohol consumption must exceed 16 unit male 7 unit female per week ( 1 unit equal 340 mL beer , 115 mL wine 43 mL spirit ) . Positive drug screen ( due concomitant medication ) alcohol breath test screen and/or Day 1 . Patients smoke 10 cigarette per day ( equivalent ) , would able abstain smoking inhouse period . Concomitant use medication know affect elimination serum creatinine ( e.g. , trimethoprim cimetidine ) competitor renal tubular secretion ( e.g. , probenecid ) within 30 day dose . Use strong inducer inhibitor CYP enzymes , 30 day dose . Use prohibit medication . Loss 400 mL blood , donation blood , plasma , platelet , blood component , 3 month trial , unwilling abstain donate study 3 month receipt final dose trial medication .
