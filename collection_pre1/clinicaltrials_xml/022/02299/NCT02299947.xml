	<brief_summary>The purpose study answer follow question : Leads primary coagulation correct single dose fibrinogen concentrate ascend aorta-arc reconstruction decrease number allogenic blood transfusion , compare placebo ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bloodtranfusions After Aortic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiothoracic surgery ( CTC ) associate blood loss increase risk impaired coagulation use CBP . Coagulation process primary hemostasis adhesion trombocytes aggregation , follow secondary coagulation fibrin formation . During CTC fibrinogen first coagulation factor reach critical concentration necessary clotting . Point Care clot assay thromboelastography ( TEG ) provide qualitative information coagulation factor clot strength . Specific coagulation factor correction impair clot improves clot strength may reduce number perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion , result possible reduction postoperative blood loss reduction risk re-operation short long term . The hypothesis study single dose fibrinogen concentrate immediately CTC lead decrease number allogenic blood transfusion patient clinically impaired clotting , verify TEG .</detailed_description>
