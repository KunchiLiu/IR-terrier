	<brief_summary>Purpose This study examine effect addition Cycloset upon glucose metabolism ( glycemic control include post prandial glucose metabolism ) individual inadequately control ( HbA1c 7.5-10.0 ) type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) already Bydureon ( exenatide weekly ) Victoza ( liraglutide daily ) part standard care . Both mechanistic rationale empirical experimental evidence implicate beneficial interaction bromocriptine incretin mimetics ( GLP-1 analog ) upon postprandial hyperglycemia insulin resistant state . One action incretin mimetics GLP-1 analog stimulate postprandial beta cell insulin secretory response plasma glucose ( see drug label information ; www.fda.gov ) . Thus combination Cycloset work post prandial insulin sensitizier therapy increase post prandial insulin would expect provide complimentary glucose lower effect . To date , however , study investigate interactive effect GLP-1 analog Bromocriptine-QR ( Cycloset ) conduct human . Condition - Type 2 Diabetes . Intervention - Cycloset . Phase - Phase 4 Study Type : Interventional Study Design : Treatment , Single Group Assignment , Open Label , N/A , Safety/Efficacy Study Official Title : Effect Cycloset Glycemic Control Type 2 Diabetic Patients Inadequately Controlled GLP-1 Analogue Therapy</brief_summary>
