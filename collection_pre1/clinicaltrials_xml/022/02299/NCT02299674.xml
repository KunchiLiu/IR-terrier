	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine path velocity center mass ( CoM ) center pressure ( CoP ) double support person walk unilateral above-the-knee prosthesis determine effect prosthetic foot stiffness effective length CoM CoP.Persons low limb amputation walk compensatory movement affect smooth trajectory center mass ( CoM ) weight transfer . The lack control foot/ankle complex reduces fine motor movement , influence progression CoM transfer ground reaction force represent center pressure ( CoP ) . Without control ankle joint , prosthetic user `` fall '' trail prosthetic limb weight transfer , result much abrupt CoM CoP transfer trail lead limb . These abrupt movement transfer increase stress sound limb , also decrease subject 's energy efficiency ambulation . The current study examine CoP path velocity relation CoM path velocity double support men transfemoral prosthesis , well explore prosthetic foot ankle stiffness effective length affect CoP path velocity .</brief_summary>
