Two study group compare prospective randomize trial ; 1 ) receive standard obstetrical care 2 ) receive behavioral weight management counseling plus financial incentive achieve weight gain goal . The main outcome measure percentage woman gain within IOM recommendation base prepregnancy BMI . Secondary outcomes evaluate include fetal growth body composition change , birth weight rate cesarean delivery . The investigator hypothesize 1 ) behavioral intervention incentive result great compliance IOM guideline gestational weight gain standard care 2 ) target weight gain IOM guideline lead reduction rate fetal macrosomia cesarean delivery . Finally , cost effectiveness treatment condition examine . This intervention , efficacious cost-effective , potential improve compliance gestational weight gain guideline , optimize perinatal outcome , reduce health disparity .</brief_summary>
