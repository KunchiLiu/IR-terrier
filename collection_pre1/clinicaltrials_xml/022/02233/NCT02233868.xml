	<brief_summary>Background : - Brain inflammation due high alcohol intake may affect thinking , memory , concentration . Researchers want measure use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Objective : - To study excessive alcohol consumption affect brain function . Eligibility : - Adults 30-75 year old moderate severe alcohol drinker . - Healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , interview , blood urine test . Their breath test alcohol recent smoking . - Phase 1 : - Participants stay hospital 3 day . They blood heart test daily urine test . - A small plastic tube insert needle arm . One go vein , artery . - Participants 2 PET scan 2 different radioactive compound . Participants lie bed slide scanner cap head . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants lie scanner either rest eye open perform attention task . - Participants test memory , attention , concentration , think . They may answer question , take test , perform simple action . - Phase 2 study do Phase 1 result show brain inflammation . - Phase 2 repeat Phase 1 . - For healthy volunteer , Phase 2 begin 3 week Phase 1 . - Other volunteer must alcohol least 3 week stay hospital 4-6 week Phase 1 Phase 2 . After Phase 2 , 5 follow-up call 3 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The abuse high dos alcohol associate cognitive impairment extreme case result dementia . However , mechanism underlie neurotoxic effect alcohol human brain poorly understood . Here test hypothesis alcohol-induced neuroinflammation contributes neurotoxic effect humans Objectives : The primary objective assess inflammation brain alcoholic present determine recovers 3 week abstinence compare group ( alcoholic vs. healthy volunteer ) Phase I . Secondary outcome evaluate functional consequence inflammation assess : regional brain glucose metabolism , functional brain activation cognitive task , structural brain imaging , rest functional connectivity neuropsychological test . Study population : Participants diagnose alcohol use disorder ( AD ) per DSM IV DSM 5 AD healthy control . Males female age 30-75 include Design : This study two phase ( phase I II ) . The two phase do inpatient ( AD subject ) outpatient ( AD healthy control ) 2-3 day period . In phase I participants undergo two positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , one [ 11C ] PBR28 ( marker neuroinflammation ) one 18FDG ( marker brain glucose metabolism ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan assess brain structure , functional reactivity functional connectivity . In parallel perform neuropsychological test ( NP ) . Phase II include procedure Phase I do 3 week later 2-3 day period participant ( alcoholic control ) Phase I show evidence inflammatory change . In AD participant Phase II do alcohol abstinence healthy control repeat intervention . We complete study least ten alcoholic user ( n=10 ) feel confident neuroinflammation . In parallel need collect data least ten ( n=10 ) control comparison group scan characteristic alcoholic preliminary investigation . Outcome parameter : Main outcome measure assess neuroinflammation alcoholism recovers detoxification . Secondary outcome measure : ass neuroinflammation associate marker brain function , include ( 1 ) regional brain glucose metabolism ; ( 2 ) MRI base voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) assess cortical atrophy ; ( 3 ) blood-oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation cognitive task , ( 4 ) brain functional connectivity , ( 5 ) myo-inositol ( mI ) concentration , ( 6 ) NP test assess cognitive performance , evaluate neuroinflammation predict relapse AD 3 month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
