	<brief_summary>Patients schizophrenia deeply affected positive symptom , negative symptom cognitive impairment . A generalized cognitive deficit could frequently observe trace back early stage disease . Currently medication intervention significantly improve positive symptom dopamine receptor modification , leave alone negative symptom cognitive impairment . Besides dopamine dysregulation , attention pay association N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) type glutamate receptor schizophrenia , focus neurobiological cognitive biomarkers change . Memantine , uncompetitive antagonist NMDA type glutamate receptor approve cognitive enhancer Alzheimer 's disease , potential candidate prevent cognitive decline schizophrenia . Previous randomized clinical trial fail demonstrate efficacy chronic schizophrenic patient might relate chronic irreversible disease process . There also study support memantine induces change mismatch negativity ( MMN ) frontal cortex healthy subject . This study compare MMN change healthy subject population early schizophrenia , persistent neurobiological , cognitive biomarkers negative symptom despite subsided positive symptom . Both male female age 20-45 year old outpatient length illness less 5 year since first diagnose schizophrenia , currently receive treatment atypical antipsychotic relatively stable condition recruit . Healthy subject recruit compare age sex . We plan recruit 10 subject patient healthy subject total 20 participant . All participant receive general clinical , cognitive event-related potential ( ERP ) evaluation baseline take medication . Twenty mg memantine give 4 hour ERP retest . The analysis perform base change ERP use paired-t sample test . Baseline clinical cognitive symptom analyze possible confounders .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Memantine ERP Early Schizophrenia Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In proposal , use one-dose memantine trial compare difference MMN change healthy subject early schizophrenia patient . The cognitive negative symptom count possible confounding variable . We would like make connection association neurobiological neurocognitive marker treatment application . The specific aim project test memantine influence ERPs change , healthy subject , patient early schizophrenia . The specific study population know first episode psychosis subside , conventionally define significantly improve positive symptom , yet complain cognitive decline present persistent negative symptom . Previous study show improvement mismatch negativity correlate general function improvement schizophrenia . Although recent study fail demonstrate positive effect residual psychopathology group chronic stable schizophrenic patient . In study target specific population early schizophrenic patient examine efficacy memantine neurobiological marker possible application general psychopathology . Our objective include : 1 . Test memantine effect change ERPs , especially focus mismatch negativity . 2 . Compare ERP difference healthy subject early schizophrenic patient 3 . Examine whether effect memantine affect significant baseline clinical variable predispose cognitive deficit . First could replicate ERP change healthy subject influenced memantine , could compare difference healthy subject patient subject . It may support hypothesis NMDA-type glutamate receptor dysregulation theory schizophrenia . If association detect large scale study ERP clinical symptom , could apply memantine add-on treatment schizophrenia . As memantine already approved medicine treatment moderate severe Alzheimer disease many country worldwide , hopefully add new indication original clinical application . Thus become first medicine help condition render lot schizophrenic patient mark impairment social occupational function early stage life . We believe impact even big original indication memantine , exclusively patient dementia . Rather delay deterioration cognitive functioning patient 's late life , adjuvant therapy early intervention schizophrenia aim improve cognitive function hence restore social occupational functioning bear great impact patient 's life trajectory lessen burden society . Furthermore , result project provide critical evidence support refute hypoglutaminergic theory schizophrenia , might important complement hyperdopaminergic theory . With good understand pathophysiology schizophrenia focus dopaminergic system-related positive symptom also glutamatergic system-related cognitive negative symptom , provide theoretic base psychopharmacology develop agent target different system improve outcome schizophrenia early stage even putative pre-psychotic stage illness .</detailed_description>
