	<detailed_description>In 2010 , 7.6 million child age five die worldwide ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . Notably , burden under-five mortality varies dramatically country . The majority total child death 2010 see Africa ( 3.6 million ) southeast Asia ( 2.1 million death ) , compare 0.16 million 0.28 million under-five death Europe Americas , respectively ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . Strikingly , nearly half world 's under-five child death 2010 could attribute five country : India , Nigeria , Democratic Republic Congo , Pakistan , China ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . In Pakistan alone , 420,000 under-five child death occur 2010 ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . A thorough understanding etiology child mortality necessary guide research effort aim tackle important global health problem . Importantly , 2010 , cause 2.7 % ( 0.205 million ) death child age five medically certify ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) , highlight need gather high-quality data cause mortality . Prospective longitudinal birth cohort study present opportunity examine temporal relationship early-life exposure ( i.e . prenatal , pregnancy , early postnatal exposure ) multiple health non-health relate outcome include mortality , morbidity , socioeconomic position . It well document exposure occur early life , include genetic , environmental , socioeconomic , lifestyle factor , may long-lasting effect growth , development , health outcome throughout individual 's entire life course ( Lynch &amp; Smith , 2005 ) . Thus , data exposure pregnancy early childhood valuable may provide clue etiology long-term outcome . Additional value gain cross-cohort collaboration comparison ( Larsen et al. , 2013 ) ( Paternoster et al. , 2012 ) ( Brion et al. , 2011 ) . By pool data multiple cohort study , causal inference make great confidence . In addition , cross-country comparison , heterogeneity exposure often increase make likely association exposure outcome observe . Similarly , cross-cohort comparison enable researcher investigate pattern associate health , social , economic outcome distinct region world . These type analysis may provide valuable insight underlie cause global health inequality . The objective study implement longitudinal prospective birth cohort study Pakistan obtain extensive high-quality information early-life exposures health non-health relate outcome first year life . Concurrent design implementation cohort study Pakistan , similar study implement Kenya ( Coastal Region Cohort , Lead PI : Dr. Shaun Morris ) , Brazil ( Pelotas Cohort , Lead PIs : Dr. Pedro R.C . Hallal , Dr. Diego G. Bassani Dr. Mariangela Silveira ) , South Africa ( Birth Twenty Cohort , Lead PI : Dr. Shane Norris ) . The investigator project communicate intent align study material effort increase ease future comparison finding . This study therefore one crucial pillar multi-country cross-cohort comparison present unique opportunity investigate compare pattern shape health non-health relate outcome individual four distinct region world .</detailed_description>
