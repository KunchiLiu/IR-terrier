	<detailed_description>This study dose escalation , cohort staggering ( slow enrollment ) 3 dose level ( low , medium high dose level ) placebo-controlled group : - Cohort 1 : A first cohort one hundred nineteen subject ( 119 ) randomize ; , seventy five ( 75 ) dose low dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) dose medium dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , twenty five ( 25 ) receive placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) consist Principal Investigator ( PI ) , Sponsor 's Medical Officer three external medical expert vote member , prior permit immunization cohort 2 . - Cohort 2 : A second cohort one hundred subject ( 100 ) subject randomize ; , fifty six ( 56 ) dose medium dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , nineteen ( 19 ) dose high dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine , twenty five ( 25 ) receive placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect review DSMB , prior permit immunization high dose . - Cohort 3 : A third cohort eighty one subject ( 81 ) subject randomize ; fifty six ( 56 ) dose high dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine twenty five ( 25 ) receive placebo . Three ( 3 ) 21 day immunization , key safety ( Day 3 ) immunogenicity ( Day 21 ) data collect analyzed . All subject follow safety Day 201 ( 6-month follow ) , regardless phase study .</detailed_description>

In opinion Investigator , competence willingness provide write , informed consent participation reading inform consent form . The subject must adequate opportunity discus study Investigator qualify designee . 4 . Healthy judge Investigator designee determine complete general physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , medical history conduct 30 day prior study vaccine administration . Subjects preexist chronic disease allow participate disease stable , accord Investigator 's judgment , condition unlikely confound result study pose additional risk subject participate study . Stable disease generally define new onset exacerbation preexist chronic disease 6 month prior immunization . Based Investigator 's judgment , subject recent stabilization disease could also eligible . 5 .

According Investigator 's opinion , presence significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical neuropsychiatric illness . `` Uncontrolled '' define : Requiring new medical surgical treatment within one month prior study vaccine administration ; Requiring change medication dosage one month prior study vaccine administration due uncontrolled symptom drug toxicity ( elective dosage adjustment stable subject acceptable ) . 2 . Any medical neuropsychiatric condition history excessive alcohol use drug abuse , Investigator 's opinion , would render subject unable provide inform consent unable provide valid safety observation report . 3 . Any autoimmune disease confirm suspected immunosuppressive condition immunodeficiency include history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , Hepatitis B C , presence lymphoproliferative disease . 4 .
