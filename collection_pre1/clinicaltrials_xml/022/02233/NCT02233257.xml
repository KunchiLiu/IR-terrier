	<detailed_description>Expanded Access Lorenzo 's Oil X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy Intermediate Size Group Introduction/Rationale : A diet consist predominantly long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid demonstrate reduce level long chain fatty acid ( VLCA ) individual X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) . VLCFA primary biochemical abnormality genetic disorder implicate pathogenesis cerebral disease . It demonstrate open study reduction VLCFA year protective childhood cerebral disease . The purpose expand access proposal transition open label study presently ongoing boy age 18 month 13 year age expand access study . The reason transition lack funding investigator continue support study . A study require investigator involvement include assistance research associate monitor track outcome , perform neuropsychological assessment , monitor adverse event , coordinate periodic evaluation . A move expand access would decentralize coordination monitoring evaluation clinically indicate even participant participate study . This role would undertake treat physician . Data collect open study could serve safety material later file . Study Population : - Males X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ; see inclusion/exclusion criterion . Procedure : 1 . Individuals wish obtain oil submit clinical documentation diagnosis Dr. Gerald Raymond . This either elevate long chain fatty acid ( VLCFA ) DNA diagnosis mutation . 2 . Identify provider responsible supervision diet . It suggest individual experience manage individual special diet biochemical geneticist neurologist experience ALD . 3 . Studies require prescription ( It important emphasize many follow perform solely use Lorenzo 's oil , cost investigation consult financial responsibility participant . ) 1 . Baseline VLCFA , complete blood count platelet , comprehensive metabolic panel 2 . Nutrition consult determination daily calorie . Thirty percent calorie provide lipid 2/3 lipid calorie provide long chain monounsaturated fatty acid ( Lorenzo 's oil ) . This nutritional evaluation include follow . . Present body parameter include weight , height , BMI ii . Calculated daily calorie nutritional need growth . iii . Calculation percent diet lipid amount oil consume daily iv . Instruction diet restriction monitoring say diet . v. Recommend supplement . vi . Instructions provide diet recall vii . Suggestions maintain improve compliance . c. An MRI adrenal test clinically indicate required part expand access . 4 . Clinical research form ( CRF ) design baseline follow information uniformity documentation . 5 . Upon receipt information , Dr. Raymond provide authorization prescription supplier , Nutricia N.A . 6 . Monitoring receive oil consist follow 1 . VLCFA ; Complete blood count ( CBC ) , Comprehensive metabolic panel every 3 month 2 . Nutrition consult yearly . 3 . Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain perform every 6-12 month 4 . Appropriate monitoring adrenal function . 5 . CRFs ' forward every three month active participant January , April , July , October schedule 6 . The identified provider responsible provide information Dr. Raymond 's office . Failure provide information result withhold authorization dispense product . 7 . No 3 month ' supply product authorize shipped time . 8 . In event development thrombocytopenia , Lorenzo 's oil suspend glyceryl trioleate ( GTO ) substitute one month reintroduce half dose Lorenzo 's oil follow incremental increase tolerate . We previously use 80,000 platelet low limit would recommend provide adequate margin safety . 7 . Adverse event track result hospitalization death report require sponsor FDA require period time . Otherwise reported adverse event tabulate report yearly IND report . Adverse event include conversion normal MRIs demonstrate cerebral disease intervention include bone marrow transplantation gene therapy presently option halt cerebral disease .</detailed_description>
