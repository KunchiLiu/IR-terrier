	<brief_summary>When compare exist analysis : manometry , Smart Pill lactulose breath testing , external Acoustic Esophago-Gastro-Intestinal Surveillance ( AEGIS ) may identify unique audible pattern characteristic feature gastroinestinal ( GI ) motility , gastric small bowel contraction empty small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . This research study design test capability AbStats/AEGIS identify associate symptom traditional diagnostics sound reading correlate data treatment outcomes successes standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot AbStats /AEGIS System Detecting Motility Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In partnership Dr. William Kaiser UCLA Wireless Health Institute , research group develop validate diagnostic capability device conduct AEGIS . A belt ( AbStats ) fit externally around abdomen embed acoustic sensor , similar `` electronic stethoscope . '' The investigational software design continuously , safely , comfortably monitor acoustic signal emanate esophagus , stomach , intestine , store data HIPAA compliant hard drive . Through study associate reading current diagnostics treatment anticipate AEGIS device eventually provide clinically interpretable information immediately actionable . In study , Abstats sensor track signal tandem current technique standard care treatment base diagnostics . AEGIS analysis could potentially refine , support , even replace , exist costly invasive technique diagnosis gastroparesis , intestinal psueodo-obstruction , colonic inertia , disorder relate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) .</detailed_description>
