	<detailed_description>Bowel cancer second prevalent cancer Australia rectal cancer common subgroup , represent 5 % cancer diagnose 2008 [ 1 ] . Rectal cancer also account 4.6 % cancer deaths New South Wales [ 1 ] . All rectal cancer T3/4 node positive pre-operative assessment consider pre-operative therapy , show significantly improve local control compare postoperative chemoradiation . [ 2 ] . Pre-operative chemoradiation standard pre-operative treatment Northern Sydney Cancer Centre approximately 40 patients/year receive treatment . Surgery normally perform 6-8 week follow chemoradiation . One unique opportunity rectal cancer histopathological analysis resect specimen give accurate assessment response tumour pre-operative chemoradiation . Those tumour pathologic complete response ( pCR ) know excellent long-term outcome . Data department Radiation Oncology Northern Sydney Cancer Centre demonstrate 17 % patient experience pCR , keep series [ 4 ] . In study 48 patient , 38 % show evidence tumour shrinkage 2 week treatment demonstrate Cone Beam CT scan take radiotherapy . 44 % patient demonstrate pCR follow surgery . In remain 62 % , none patient pCR . This confirm principle early response radiation base gross tumour shrinkage powerful predictor subsequent response . Assessing response Cone Beam CT subjective possible patient . Furthermore may possible good predict likely complete response alternate imaging modality . There emerge data functional microstructural imaging modality also use predict assess treatment response prior , follow delivery pre-operative chemoradiation locally advanced rectal cancer [ 5 ] . Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) microstructural imaging technique characterize tissue base difference movement water molecule . These difference quantify use apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . The ADC show differentiate post-treatment inflammation necrosis recurrent persistent tumoural tissue rectal cancer high specificity [ 6 ] . Pre-treatment ADC assessment DWI sensitivity 100 % specificity 86 % detection pCR ( p=0.003 ) whilst treatment induce change ADC ( measure week 2 chemoradiation ) sensitivity specificity 100 % predict pCR ( p=0.0006 ) [ 5 ] . Prediction response improve use PET imaging . A stag 18F-FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) PET/CT demonstrate provide new finding compare contrast-enhanced CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis result change stage disease alteration treatment strategy 14 % patient [ 7 ] . F-FDG PET/CT predictive histological response outcome anatomic image alone [ 8 ] . Whilst PET Response Criteria Solid Tumors ( PERCIST ) show predictive power response neoadjuvant therapy , PET Residual Disease Solid Tumor ( PREDIST ) criteria show correlate pCR ( p = 0.004 ) [ 9 ] .</detailed_description>
