	<brief_summary>The patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) present high mortality morbidity rate , even treat stenting blocked heart vessel . The appearance no-reflow common re-opening blocked vessel . The no-reflow commonly attribute tiny blockage coronary micro-vasculature thrombus spasm micro-vessel stenting . An agent effective anti-clotting micro-vessel dilation would helpful solve issue no-reflow . Ticagrelor demonstrate potent platelet inhibitor potent micro-vessel dilator influence metabolism adenosine , endogenous potent small vessel dilator . This study test effectiveness ticagrelor improve reperfusion minimize myocardial infarct size PPCI patient AMI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) present high mortality morbidity rate , also malignant prognosis even could survive . The mortality prognosis improve markedly treatment primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) . However , issue no-reflow revascularization solve yet . The mechanisms no-reflow human regard mainly micro-embolism coronary micro-circulation thrombus debris atherosclerotic plaque , coronary micro-vasculature spasm condition . Therefore , agent potent antithrombotic micro-vasculature dilation function would effective prevention no-reflow coronary revascularization . Ticagrelor demonstrate potent platelet inhibitor potent micro-vessel dilator influence metabolism adenosine . Ticagrelor inhibit adenosine uptake vitro subsequently augment cardiac blood flow canine model reactive hypoxia- adenosine-induced blood flow increase . In dog coronary thrombosis model , ticagrelor block ADP-induced platelet activation aggregation ; prevents platelet-mediated thrombosis ; prolongs reperfusion time reduce re-occlusion cyclic flow variation ; significantly decrease infarct size rapidly restore myocardial tissue perfusion . These finding suggest ticagrelor may additional benefit patient acute coronary syndrome beyond inhibition platelet aggregation , advantageous dilation microcirculation improvement myocardial perfusion . AMISTAD study show : adenosine reperfusion therapy reduce 33 % infarction area assess single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) detection . AMISTAD- 2 study show : adenosine early reperfusion therapy reduce composite end point death heart failure event . Additionally , ticagrelor non-precursor agent , play role directly platelet inhibition . Myocardial perfusion image SPECT among widely use well-established noninvasive tool diagnosis ischemic coronary disease . It show high sensitivity specificity identify patient coronary artery disease accurate identify area prior myocardial infarction . Given evidence ( PLATO trial ) great IPA ticagrelor clopidogrel , similar risk major bleed probable effect micro-vasculature dilation due adenosine , ticagrelor improve reperfusion decrease infarct size significantly . This study test effectiveness ticagrelor improve reperfusion minimize myocardial infarct size PPCI patient AMI . Also , evaluate safety ticagrelor patient AMI .</detailed_description>
