	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common cancer men . It often detect abnormal digital rectal exam elevate Prostate-Specific Antigen -determine blood test . When suspect someone may prostate cancer , biopsy order . This biopsy perform Radiologist ultrasound guidance rectum . In patient , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan prostate may order evaluate prostate . In situation , MRI Ultrasound image fuse ( digitally merge ) together ultrasound procedure help localize questionable lesion . Recent research use additional component know contrast agent - intravenously inject inert substance - identifiable ultrasound . This inert substance obvious area increase blood flow , common find cancerous lesion . In research project , would like determine whether use contrast-enhanced ultrasound beneficial improve accuracy biopsy take relative correlation MRI/ Ultrasound-fused image .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI / Ultrasound Fusion With Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It hypothesis cancerous lesion prostate increased amount blood flow , lesion identify ultrasound benefit contrast-enhanced imaging correlate MRI Findings real-time . A study 50 patient would undergo MRI/Ultrasound fusion would select contrast added procedure . The lesion identify MRI would evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound . The finding contrast study could correlate MRI finding . The rest prostate gland would also assess use contrast agent lesion identify MRI image study . The pathology result could correlate contrast study MRI study independently , conjunction two imaging modality . If correlation highly suspicious lesion MRI significant flow pattern contrast establish , sensitivity specificity contrast-enhanced ultrasound increase . While MRI / Ultrasound Fusion show increase prostate cancer identification target biopsy , limited modality due cost associate . Many site also access MRI unit , fusion system prohibitively expensive , require specialized training configure system modulate image real-time . However , ultrasound expensive modality readily available . If material method utilization contrast-enhanced ultrasound correlate MRI / Ultrasound fusion , good protocol develop contrast-enhanced ultrasound . This cost-effective method identify target prostate cancer could export small community would otherwise still carry sextant biopsy model .</detailed_description>
