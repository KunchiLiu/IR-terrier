	<brief_title>Treating Parastomal Hernia With Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parastomal hernia common complication patient stoma may cause patient difficulty stomal dressing leakage stomal content , well pain risk incarceration . The exact hernia incidence know , depend definition whether bulge consider hernia , well duration follow-up . The reported incidence range 0 52 % . The majority parastomal hernia develop within year index operation , appear late 20 year surgery . There superior treatment exist parastomal hernia . Several method test used stoma relocation , suture narrow open fascia abdominal wall fixation closure lateral space none proven prevent recurrence herniation . Mesh repair show give low recurrence rate 0-33 % . No technical factor , site stoma formation ( lateral rectus abdominis muscle ) , related construction stoma proven prevent hernia formation . To find way prevent occurrence parastomal hernia important issue . Today report propose mesh sublay position index operation would prevent hernia formation . Although result promise study small meet issue late complication accord mesh implant . The use intraperitoneal on-lay mesh ( IPOM ) widely use treat incisional hernia . A new mesh ( Parastomal hernia mesh BARD ) tailor treat parastomal hernia . To evaluate safety hernia recurrence rate use BARD-mesh treat parastomal hernia prospective multicentre non-randomised study perform . The aim include 50 patient study . Patients parastomal hernia require surgery due leakage , problem stoma dress , bulge , incarceration problem relate hernia offer enrollment study inform consent . The preoperative examination include clinical examination , three dimensional ultrasonography ( 3D ) compute tomography ( CT ) abdomen . Surgery four hospital perform experienced colorectal surgeon special interest parastomal hernia . Postoperatively patient allow mobilize accord hospital postoperative routine . Follow-up visit one month , one year three year schedule . Early complication like infection , ileus , myocardial infarction , pneumonia , urinary infection thrombosis evaluate one-month follow-up clinical examination . At one three year follow-up late complication possible recurrence parastomal hernia search . CT perform one year postoperatively . At three year follow-up CT 3D perform . Important outcome measure complication recurrence parastomal hernia .</detailed_description>
