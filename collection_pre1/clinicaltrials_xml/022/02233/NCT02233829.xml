	<brief_summary>Background : - Dopamine chemical signal link rewarding effect drug . Certain gene make effect sensitive time day take . Cocaine affect gene brain . Researchers want measure brain dopamine different time day . Objectives : - To look change person biological clock function dopamine reward system . To test cocaine disrupts . Eligibility : - Adults age 21-55 cocaine use disorder . - Healthy volunteer age 21-55 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , interview , blood urine test . Their breath test alcohol recent smoking . - Participants 3 overnight clinic visit . - Visit 1 : They blood urine collect heart test . - A plastic tube ( catheter ) place vein arm needle . - Participants PET scan donut-shaped machine . They lie bed slide , wear cap . A radiotracer ( measure dopamine ) drug ( block dopamine removal ) inject via catheter . Vital sign measure blood drawn throughout . - Visit 2 : repeat Visit 1 , except night . - Visit 3 , participant urine collect . - They MRI scan metal cylinder surround magnetic field . They lie table slide , coil head . - Participants may answer question , take computer paper test , perform simple action . - For 1 week , participant wear wrist device measure daily activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective ass disruption circadian DA rhythm cocaine addiction . The secondary objective ass dopamine modulates sensitivity brain reward network circadian dependent manner . Study Population : Non-treatment seek cocaine abuser ( moderate severe cocaine use disorder per DSM-IV ) healthy control . Males female include . Design : Participants undergo two PET scan [ 11C ] raclopride use bolus infusion paradigm ass baseline D2R availability follow infusion ass change DA measure [ 11C ] raclopride displacement follow intravenous injection methylphenidate ( MP ) . They also undergo total 4 MRI scan , two placebo two MP ass circadian variation sensitivity brain reward network . The two [ 11C ] raclopride scan do separate day least one week apart , one morning starting ( 7-9 AM ) one early evening ( 5-7 PM ) follow MRI scan ass sensitivity brain reward network influence MP morning ( 9-11AM ) evening ( 7-9 PM ) . For Placebo MRI scan participant test either separate day morning evening session even prior morning session . We use MRI scan assess sensitivity brain reward circuit visual presentation drug food cue evaluate rest functional connectivity . Outcome Parameters : Main outcome measure ass difference DA release morning evening ( displacement [ 11C ] raclopride bind MP ) determine diurnal pattern differ cocaine addiction . Secondary outcome measure : To assess DA signal correlate reactivity brain region exposure food drug cue functional connectivity reward network assess reactivity reward network show circadian variability . We also assess difference DA signal morning even correlate circadian typology measure spontaneous motor activity sleep pattern .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ALL PARTICIPANTS : 1 . Between 21 55 year age . 2 . Ability provide write informed consent . INCLUSION CRITERIA SPECIFIC FOR COCAINE USE DISORDER ( CUD ) PARTICIPANTS : 1 . DSMIV DSM5 diagnosis moderate severe cocaine use disorder ( establish history clinical exam ) . 2 . Nontreatment seek cocaine user ( actively consume cocaine last use within one week study assess selfreports ) . 3 . Minimum 10 year history cocaine abuse predominantly via smoke injection selfreport . 4 . Must consume least 4 gram cocaine per week selfreport . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ALL PARTICIPANTS : 1 . Use , past two week , psychoactive medication ( four week fluoxetine ) medication may affect brain function ( include limit meperidine , tricyclic antidpressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) determine medical history physical exam . 2 . Current past DSMIV DSM5 diagnosis psychiatric disorder ( cocaine cocaine abuser , nicotine/caffeine participant ) require hospitalization ( length ) , chronic medication management ( 4 week ) could impact brain function time study determine history clinical exam . 3 . Current previous chronic treatment ( great 3 month ) stimulant medication ( amphetamine methylphenidate ) . 4 . Major medical problem permanently impact brain function ( e.g. , CNS include seizure psychosis ; cardiovascular include hypertension [ BP &gt; 140/90 ] clinically significant arrhythmias except bradycardia ; metabolic , autoimmune , endocrine ; +HIV ) determine history . 5 . Any clinically significant laboratory find determine screening procedure could impact brain function study procedure evidence clinical laboratory result . Since half participant study diagnosis cocaine use disorder , expect clinically significant finding would reflect recent cocaine use . As example , participant might mildly elevated Creatinine Kinase result recent cocaine use . The test would reflect acute rhabdomyolysis due recent cocaine use , would clinically significant . Nevertheless , mild episode expect cocaine use , would affect brain functioning increase risk procedure participant study . Therefore , abnormal laboratory finding clinical significance exclude . If finding reflect alter brain function ( e.g. , arrhythmias renal failure ) exclusionary study . 6 . Have previous radiation exposure ( Xrays , PET scan , exposure ) , exposure study , would exceed NIH annual research limit determine medical history physical exam . 7 . Head trauma loss consciousness 30 minute determine medical history physical exam ; 8 . Positive test drug day PET , MRI NP test evidence clinical laboratory result . 9 . Pregnant breast feeding : Females must negative urine pregnancy test currently breastfeed . Postmenopausal surgically sterile ( tubal ligation hysterectomy ) ; sexually active male partner able get pregnant ; document agreement use effective form birth control . Acceptable form contraception include : hormonal contraceptive ( birthcontrol pill , injectable hormone , vaginalring hormone ) ; IUD ; diaphragm spermicide ; condom spermicide . 10 . History coagulation disorder evidence clinical laboratory result , medical history . 11 . History glaucoma determine medical history . 12 . Presence ferromagnetic object body contraindicate MRI head ( pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment ) fear enclose space selfreport checklist . 13 . Personal family history cerebral aneurism . 14 . Past present history chest pain trouble breathing activity . 15 . Diabetes assess medical history . 16 . High risk silent heart diseases evidence high level highsensitivity Creactive protein homocysteine blood , overweight obese . In addition patient high cholesterol family history heart disease evaluate cardiologist determine eligibility participation . The cardiologist might request additional test deem necessary ensure fitness participation ( ie treadmill stress test ) . Specifically cardiologist involve review finding 1 ) inability reach endpoint , 2 ) development chest pain , 3 ) significant ST segment change , 4 ) significant arrhythmia , 5 ) inability appropriately increase blood pressure heart rate exercise order determine participant suitable inclusion study . 17 . Can lie comfortably flat back 2 hour PET MRI scanner selfreport . 18 . Weight &gt; 400 pound maximum weight PET scanner hold . 19 . Study investigator staff , well superior , subordinate immediate family member ( adult child , spouse , parent , sibling ) . Note : At time subject express he/she want get treatment cocaine use , immediately refer him/her treatment program . The subject withdrawn study time .</criteria>
