	<brief_summary>Patients impair blood supply heart routinely receive oxygen order improve preserve oxygen supply heart muscle acute cardiac care . In recent study new innovative MRI-technique detect change oxygen supply heart able show administration oxygen fast breathing decrease blood supply artery supply heart muscle oxygen . Thus , administration oxygen may paradoxically impair oxygen supply heart muscle . In study investigator want investigate , whether administration exogenous oxygen via mask alone combination fast breathing lead decrease oxygen supply region already impair blood supply narrow coronary artery heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Breathing Maneuvers Oxygenation Supply Heart Assessed With MRI Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients acute myocardial ischemia receive oxygen standard measure care maintain improve myocardial oxygen supply . In 1975 Neil et al . able show high oxygen concentration reduce myocardial blood flow . However , since oxygen concentration blood significantly increase was/is assume high oxygen supply outweigh decrease perfusion . Oxygenation-Sensitive ( OS ) Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) new technology use paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin blood endogenous contrast . An drop tissue oxygenation ( drop oxyhemoglobin ) result increase deoxyhemoglobin , result drop SI OS-images . Vice versa increase tissue oxygenation result increase OS-SI . Therefore , OS-CMR ass myocardial tissue oxygenation change non-invasively , free contrast free radiation . While diagnostic modality give information myocardial oxygenation surrogate parameter may indicate ischemia OS-CMR give local functional information myocardial oxygen supply . Studies perform use OS-CMR detection coronary artery disease . More recently breathe maneuver change systemic blood gas suggest vasoactive stimulus detect coronary artery disease measure change myocardial oxygen supply . Guensch et al . able show hypercapnia combination hypercapnia hypoxia lead increase myocardial oxygenation explain increase blood flow . However , hypocapnia result decrease myocardial oxygenation healthy volunteer . In porcine model investigator able show increase systemic oxygen supply result decrease myocardial blood flow healthy swine acute coronary artery stenosis , decrease myocardial oxygenation observe animal coronary artery stenosis ( Abstract Guensch et al : Administration exogenous oxygen may worsen myocardial ischemia , ESC 2014 , accept ) . The impact hyperoxia well hypocapnia hypercapnia human chronic coronary artery disease poorly investigate . As administration oxygen part treat guideline acute myocardial ischemia certain situation ( e.g . anesthesia ) high oxygen concentration maintain safety reason , important investigate role high oxygen concentration coronary artery disease . Further investigator want shed light transient state hypocapnia hypercapnia induce voluntary breathing . Because OS-CMR safe diagnostic tool ( radiation , contrast , pharmacologic vasodilator require ) give insight oxygenation change heart ideal test hypothesis . Therefore investigator want invite patient know coronary stenosis ( confirm previous coronary angiography ) schedule percutaneous coronary intervention ( stag PCI ) coronary artery bypass surgery participate study prior intervention compare MRI result healthy volunteer . All participant perform hyperventilation consecutive breath-hold well inhale oxygen 3-5 minute breathe maneuver repeat . For patient result compare finding coronary angiography ( QCA , reduction lumen-diameter vessel ) . Objective With study investigator want investigate whether administration oxygen , well perform breathe maneuver ( hyperventilation , breath-holding ) negative positive effect oxygenation myocardium subtend artery diseased coronary artery disease , oppose healthy subject . Methods CAD-patients know coronary pathology schedule PCI coronary bypass surgery recruit CMR exam prior coronary intervention . A i.v . line place safety reason . During short breath-holds oxygenation-sensitive baseline image cardiac function image acquire . The subject ask hyperventilate one minute 20-30 breaths/min . Immediately maximal breath-hold perform end-expiration long subject comfortably bear . During entire breath-hold oxygenation sensitive image record . Whenever subject feel need breath , he/she immediately signal technician call bell . After recovery subject breath oxygen 12-15L/min mask 3-5 min oxygenation sensitive image well function image repeat . The hyperventilation-breath-hold repeated oxygen . Healthy volunteer undergo protocol .</detailed_description>
