	<brief_summary>REP 2139-Ca nucleic acid polymer . Nucleic acid polymer previously show clear serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) preclinically ( duck HBV infect duck ) human patient act synergistically immunotherapeutic agent pegylated interferon-alpha 2a thymosin alpha-1 restore host immunological control HBV infection . HBsAg essential component hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , therefore direct action REP 2139-Ca remove serum HBsAg synergistic effect pegylated interferon-alpha 2a expect significant antiviral effect HDV infection . This study examine safety efficacy REP 2139-Ca therapy use combination pegylated interferon alpha-2a patient HBV / HDV co-infection . The primary hypothesis test combined dose regimen safe well tolerated patient HBV / HDV co-infection assess examine number patient adverse event ( include report symptoms laboratory abnormality ) . The secondary hypothesis test combined dose regimen antiviral effect HBV / HDV co-infection patient assess examine follow outcome : 1 . The number patient reduction serum HBsAg . 2 . The number patient reduction serum HDAg HDV RNA 3 . The number patient experience sustain antiviral response treatment stop ( reduction serum HBV DNA HDV RNA ) . The secondary hypothesis test combination approach effective</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nucleic acid polymer ( NAPs ) utilize sequence independent property phosphorothioated oligonucleotides target apolipoprotein interaction involve formation HBV subviral particle ( SVPs ) comprise mainly hepatitis B surface antigen protein ( HBsAg ) . The effect NAPs block formation SVPs inside infect hepatocytes prevents secretion . As SVPs account &gt; 99.99 % HBsAg blood , NAPs effective approach clear HBsAg serum HBV infect patient . Previous clinical trial demonstrate treatment NAP REP 2139 result rapid effective clearance HBsAg blood . This HBsAg removal immediate effect unmask underlying , pre-existing anti-HBsAg ( anti-HBs ) response , allow clearance HBV virus blood . HBsAg important immunosuppressive effect HBV infection show block adaptive innate immune process . Removal HBsAg blood patient remove immunosuppressive effect . Thus , important additional effect removal HBsAg blood greatly enhance effect immunotherapeutic agent like pegylated interferon alpha-2a thymosin alpha-1 stimulate recovery complete immune control HBV infection . HDV superinfection occur patient HBV infection HDV require HBsAg protein assembly . Therefore , expect removal serum HBsAg ( HBV SVPs ) unmasking anticipate , pre-existing anti-HBsAg response REP 2139 result clearance HBV HDV blood . Furthermore , enhance effect immunotherapy absence serum HBsAg potential provide durable control HBV HDV infection persist treatment .</detailed_description>
