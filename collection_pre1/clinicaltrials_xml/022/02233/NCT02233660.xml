	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial investigate change hand function , active cervical range motion pinch grip force application physical therapy woman carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . The purpose study compare change function , cervical range motion pinch grip force induce application physical therapy program include manual therapy target area related median nerve endoscopic surgery woman CTS medium long-term follow-up . The hypothesis manual therapy effective increase cervical range motion pinch grip force , similarly effective improve function , surgical treatment woman CTS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Cervical Spine Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence suggest CTS associate restrict cervical range motion deficit pinch grip force . In fact , restrict cervical range motion deficit pinch grip force seem independent electro-diagnostic finding . These finding would associate propose `` double crush syndrome '' theory . However longitudinal study conduct . Further demonstrated hand function associate deficit outcomes . Since previous study support use physical therapy surgical intervention management function patient , aim study conduct randomize clinical trial determine change hand function relate change active cervical range motion pinch grip force application physical therapy program include manual therapy target area related median nerve endoscopic surgery woman CTS .</detailed_description>
