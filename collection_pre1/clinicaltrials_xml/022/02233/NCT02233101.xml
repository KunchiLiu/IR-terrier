	<detailed_description>Purpose : Examine oral intravenous Tranexamic Acid ( TXA ) determine whether different route drug administration equivalent term post-operative reduction hemoglobin , number transfusion , post-operative blood loss follow TJA surgery . Hypothesis : Oral intravenous TXA equivalent route drug administration . Background/Scientific review : Total hip knee arthroplasty associate risk moderate significant blood loss . Techniques use antifibrinolytics desmopressin , normovolaemic haemodilution use reduce need allogeneic blood transfusion . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) use reduce blood loss transfusion requirement total hip knee arthroplasty , good result . Approximately one-third patient undergoing total joint replacement surgery require one three unit blood postoperatively . Tranexamic acid synthetic antifibrinolytic agent successfully use intravenously control bleed total joint replacement . The use TXA show significantly reduce need blood product total joint replacement1-4 . There study directly compare outcome follow use intravenous tranexamic acid ( IVTA ) oral tranexamic acid ( OTA ) arthroplasty surgery . In randomized study Zohar et al5 . OTA ( n = 20 ) associate significant allogeneic blood spar com- par control ( n = 20 ) , compare short- long-term IVTA regimen . A recent randomized trial compare OTA ( n = 26 ) placebo ( n = 20 ) report significant reduction blood drain 24 hour , fall Hb Hct OTA group , without significant difference requirement transfusion6 . Study Design : Prospective , randomize , single-blinded study Treatment Groups : 1 . Intravenous TXA Group - 1 gram IV bolus 10 minute prior incision 2 . Oral TXA Group - 3 tablet ( 1950 mg ) oral 2 hour prior incision Demographics/Patient Specifics : Age , Sex , ASA score , Weight , Height , Estimated intra-operative blood loss , Intra-operative fluid ( crystalloid , colloid ) , Operative time , Hospitalization day , BMI , Pre-operative PT/INR , Pre-operative PTT , Pre-operative platelet count Outcome Measurements : 1 . Post-operative reduction Hgb - Measure pre-operative Hgb level post-operative day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 Hgb level . Among study present , use different time point determine reduction Hgb . They either use post-operative 12-hour Hgb , post-operative day 4 Hgb , low Hgb hospitalization . Because rarely patient stay post-operative day 4 , make measure different time period . We patient get discharge early post-operative day 1 , 'll probably use post-operative day 1 Hgb level . We feel Hgb level difference &gt; 1 g/dL clinically significant . 2 . Post-operative reduction Hematocrit - Measure pre-operative post-operative day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 Hematocrit level 3 . Number unit transfuse 4 . Number patient transfuse 5 . Cost comparison - Cost difference result difference blood transfusion rate , length hospital stay , management complication well cost TXA 6 . Complications 1 . DVT PE 2 . Return OR within 30 day 3 . Re-admission within 30 day 4 . Superficial infection 5 . Deep infection 6 . Periprosthetic fracture 7 . Cerebrovascular accident Transient ischemic attack 8 . Dislocation Risks/Benefits The use Tranexamic Acid standard care use everyday primary revision surgery , include oral intravenous form Tranexamic Acid . TXA side effect include nausea , vomit and/or diarrhea . Gastrointestinal upset could occur Oral tranexamic acid . The risk involve potential breach confidentiality and/or privacy . Below description procedure maintain confidentiality . There direct benefit participant study . Procedures Maintaining Confidentiality A breach confidentiality and/or privacy risk study .
