	<brief_summary>Cushing syndrome refers manifestation induce chronic glucocorticoid excess may arise various cause . Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome account patient , give exogenous glucocorticoid treatment . In contrast , spontaneous Cushing syndrome result endogenous glucocorticoid over-secretion . Although Cushing disease rare , common cause spontaneous Cushing syndrome . The patient Cushing disease pituitary corticotroph adenoma , overproduces adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) . ACTH stimulate adrenal gland over-secret glucocorticoid . Patients untreated Cushing disease show poor prognosis , estimate 5-year survival rate 50 % . The first line treatment tumor resection . Other management include radiotherapy , medication bilateral adrenalectomy . The initial remission rate high ( 66-90 % ) . However , patient encounter disease recurrence follow-up . The aim study clarify factor associate recurrence treatment . In study , review patient Cushing disease thoroughly analyze associate predisposing factor . These risk factor remind clinical physician early detect recurrent disease patient , prevent morbidity mortality later live .</brief_summary>
