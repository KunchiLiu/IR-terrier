	<brief_summary>This study compare quantity active metabolite consume pomegranate juice three different preparation . People participate study come Center screen visit , include blood test medical history . If qualify base screen visit , come Center fast morning three different day . You eat standardize breakfast drink one three juice , remain metabolic test Center period time eat . You also provide standardized lunch water period . Each visit last 7 hour . During time , rest 24 hour follow drinking juice , collect urine . Following three 7-hour visit , return Center next day fast blood draw , drop urine sample , pick new container collect another 24 hour urine sample . The following day , return Center drop second urine sample collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pomegranate ( Punica granatum L. ) fruit widely consume pomegranate juice ( PJ ) , health benefit study extensively animal human ( 1-6 ) . The pomegranate fruit rich source polyphenols , ellagitannins ( ETs ) . Pomegranate extract , incorporate major polyphenols pomegranate fruit , develop dry liquid form provide alternative convenient source obtain bioactive polyphenols find PJ . We previously report pharmacokinetics metabolism pomegranate polyphenols , consumption PJ normal healthy human volunteer ( 7 ) . In human , ETs convert ellagic acid ( EA ) small intestine absorb maximum plasma concentration observe approximately 1 hour . EA disappear plasma 6 hour administration PJ . Ellagitannins ellagic acid remain intestine convert gut microflora urolithin-A , absorbed derivative , metabolize phase II enzymes excrete human urine 48 hour consumption PJ ( 7 ) . Polyphenols dietary constituent plant associate health-promoting effect . In human diet , polyphenols generally consume food along macronutrients . Because health benefit polyphenols critically determine bioavailability , effect interaction plant phenol food macronutrients important topic . The protein-polyphenol complex significantly change plasma kinetics profile . ( 8 ) Protein-polyphenol binding mediate combination hydrogen hydrophobic bond depend chemical ( polarity ) structural ( size/shape ) property interact molecule . Covalent interaction purify glycinin , soybean storage protein , select flavonoid phenolic acid also report . Recently report protein-rich defatted soybean flour protect anthocyanins transit upper digestive tract subsequent colonic delivery/metabolism ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
