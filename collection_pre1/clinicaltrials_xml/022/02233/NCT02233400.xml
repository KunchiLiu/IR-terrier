	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery proven effective long term treatment morbid obesity . In attempt reduce patient ' post-operative hospital stay , low associate health care cost , improve satisfaction score , St Luke 's University Health Network ( SLUHN ) recently adopt fast track bariatric surgery ( FTBS ) protocol . Findings date show FTBS safe effective perform Center Excellence ( COE ) . However , post-operative pain control remain challenging issue , intravenous ( IV ) PO ( mouth ) narcotic appropriate bariatric surgery patient . IV acetaminophen , use successfully Europe , recently approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) use US . However , data exist regard use IV acetaminophen bariatric surgery patient , data assess cost effectiveness . Therefore , study investigate economic impact administer IV acetaminophen bariatric surgery patient , well effect clinical outcome patient ' post-operative length stay , self-reported pain , readmission , emergency room ( ER ) visit complication . The study design randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , controlled trial single bariatric Center Excellence ( COE ) part St. Luke 's University Health Network ( SLUHN ) . Patients consist 200 morbidly obese adult bariatric surgery candidate &gt; 18 year age undergo either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( LRYGB ) laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy ( LSG ) . Group 1 ( treatment ) receive IV acetaminophen plus IV narcotic first 6 hour post-surgery follow IV/ PO narcotic remain 18 hour . Group 2 ( control ) receive IV normal saline plus IV narcotic first 6 hour post-surgery follow IV/PO narcotic remain 18 hour . Data analysis include quantile regression , mixed randomized-repeated analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) select univariate comparison , p &lt; .05 denote statistical significance outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Cost Effectiveness IV Acetaminophen Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , prospective , randomize control trial conduct single accredit bariatric center part multi-campus university teach hospital . The Institutional Review Board approve study . We hypothesize administer IV acetaminophen plus IV narcotics/PO narcotic bariatric patient produce significant cost saving hospital network , well result low self-reported pain baseline 24 hour post-surgery ; decrease hospital length stay ( LOS ) &lt; 24 hour ; high overall patient satisfaction compare patient receive IV narcotic plus normal saline placebo . Based small clinically meaningful difference mean pain score &lt; 3 IV Acetaminophen group versus &gt; 5 normal saline group ( represent minimum reduction 40 % ) , 24 patient require achieve 92 % power α = .05 . To ensure adequate number complete data point , decision make recruit total 100 patient . Inclusion exclusion criterion present table 1 . Patients randomly assign either treatment control group 1:1 ratio use permuted block size 8 . To preserve blind group assignment among surgeon , patient , nurse team member , randomization number generate statistician print placed medication infusion bag pharmacist . Group 1 ( treatment ) receive IV acetaminophen ( 1g 100 ml 0.9 % normal saline IV Q 6hrs 24 hour ) plus IV narcotic ( 2-4 mg IV Q2hrs PRN ) 30 minute surgery , follow medication plus IV narcotic ( 2-4 mg IV Q2hrs PRN ) / PO narcotic ( Oxycodone 5-10 ml PO Q4 hr PRN ) remain 18 hour . Group 2 ( control ) receive IV normal saline ( 100 ml 0.9 % normal saline IV Q 6hrs 24 hour ) plus IV narcotic ( 2-4 mg IV Q2hrs PRN ) 30 minute surgery , follow saline plus IV narcotic ( 2-4 mg IV Q2hrs PRN ) / PO narcotic ( Oxycodone 5-10 ml PO Q4 hr PRN ) remain 18 hour . Pain formally assess every 2 hour first 24 hour post-surgery use 10-point ordinal scale , 0 represent pain 10 represent worst pain . Rescue narcotic give need depend whether self-reported pain moderate ( 4-6 10-point pain scale ) severe ( &gt; 7 10-point pain scale ) . In first 6 hour , patient offer IV narcotic . After first 6 hour , patient offer either IV PO narcotic deem appropriate administer nurse base clinical condition ability tolerate PO intake . For moderate pain , patient receive either IV morphine 2 mg IV Q2hrs PRN PO Oxycodone 5 ml PO Q4hrs PRN . For severe pain , patient receive either IV morphine 4 mg IV Q2hrs PRN PO Oxycodone 10 ml PO Q4hrs PRN . Total hospital network cost relevant service represent dollar amount continuous variable . Total cost include direct indirect cost . Direct cost base postoperative length stay cost associate acetaminophen narcotic administration . Indirect cost include cost ER visit secondary postoperative pain also performance radiographic study postoperatively evaluate abdominal pain deem clinically necessary attend surgeon . Hospital length stay ( LOS ) dichotomize &lt; 24 hour &gt; 24 hour , give expect relative infrequency patient require stay &gt; 24 hour . Patients ' self-reported satisfaction assess use 5-point Likert scale ( strongly disagree strongly agree ) 10 day 2 week post-surgery ( see Figure 1 ) . Descriptive outcome report mean standard deviation normally distribute continuous variable ; median interquartile range skew continuous variable ; frequency percentages categorical variable Primary outcome include follow variable • Total hospital network direct cost ( include direct cost per adjust patient day cost IV acetaminophen , morphine narcotic administration ) : The original data analysis plan call quantile regression covariates treatment group ( IV acetaminophen plus narcotic versus IV narcotic plus normal saline ) surgery type ( LRYGB versus LSG ) , base assumption direct cost data would skew unequal variance across distribution sample group outcomes . However , preliminary inspection data reveal basic assumption normality sample distribution , homogeneity variance absence significantly influential outlier meet . Therefore , conduct factorial randomized-groups analysis variance ( ANOVA ) between-group factor treatment group surgery type , well treatment group * surgery type interactional effect . - Mean self-reported pain score : mixed randomized-repeated measure analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) randomize factor treatment group ( IV acetaminophen plus narcotic versus IV narcotic plus normal saline ) surgery type ( LRYGB versus LSG ) ; repeat measure factor pain score time ( i.e. , 2-hours interval 2 22 hour ) ; first post-operative pain scale assessment covariate . Pain score measure numeric scale , 0 represent pain 10 represent worst imaginable pain . Prior data analysis , assumption normality sample distribution , homogeneity variance , presence significantly influential outlier , linearity baseline pain score covariate subsequent pain score , homogeneity regression covariate-outcomes slope evaluate . These assumption meet exception moderate heterogeneity variance IV acetaminophen-LSG group 10-hour pain score largely curvilinear relationship covariate subsequent pain score . Therefore , covariate logarithmically transform , conservative p-value &lt; .025 use assess pain score time . In order obtain clear understanding repeat measure main effect pain score time , additional analysis variance exclude covariate baseline pain score also conduct . - Length stay ( &lt; 24 hour versus &gt; 24 hour ) : Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test treatment group surgery type stratification variable . - Patient satisfaction : patient satisfaction survey give patient study fill first postoperative visit Post-Operative Day ( POD ) # 7 POD # 10 . The questionnaire fill patient collect study coordinator analysis patient examine surgeon avoid bias report satisfaction score . Separate Mann Whitney rank sum test treatment group surgery type - Patient rating overall pain : pain overall score ( 0-10 ) also collect first postoperative visit POD # 7 POD # 10 factorial randomized-groups ANOVA treatment group , surgery type treatment group*surgery type interaction</detailed_description>
