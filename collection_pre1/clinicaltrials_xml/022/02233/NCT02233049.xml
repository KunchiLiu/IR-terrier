	<brief_summary>Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas ( DIPG ) appear almost exclusively child adolescent , represent 15 20 % posterior fossa tumour . Even one common malignant brain tumour , 30 40 new case per year France . Their clinical presentation stereotype short clinical history unique MRI appearance usually consider sufficient establish diagnosis . The prognosis DIPG always unfavourable ; median overall survival 9 10 month general patient die within two year diagnosis ( Kaplan 1996 , Hargrave 2006 ) . Malignant glioma infiltrate brainstem represent great challenge paediatric oncology ; despite numerous collaborative study perform , patient ' survival significantly increase thirty year ( Hargrave 2009 ) . There validated prognostic factor . There currently validate treatment except radiotherapy . Several targeted agent test DIPG ( Pollack 2007 Haas-Kogan 2008 , Geoerger , 2011 ) , without know whether target present tumour . A critical review paradigm trial tell u long term survivor study say patient may benefit tested therapy , . So far , new therapy try evaluate one search treatment would effective patient , measure treatment effect median survival . They reject ineffective . However investigator challenge endpoint evaluate efficacy trial existence long term survivor ( &gt; 18 month , example ) number ignore , especially targeted therapy consider . The investigator propose paradigm shift choice treatment ; issue raise would give patient treatment associate high likelihood efficacy base specific biological tumour profile . The development target therapy malignant glioma infiltrate brainstem hamper absence biological data . It therefore crucial good understand biology tumour . Despite safety biopsy brainstem tumour , team paediatric neurosurgery limit use stereotactic biopsy clinically radiologically unusual form . Until recently , systematic genetic study diagnosis date available data confound inclusion autopsy clinically radiologically unusual case ( Louis , 1993 ; Gilbertson 2003 ; Okada , 2008 ; Zarghooni 2010 ; Broniscer , 2010 ; Wu , 2012 Schwartzentruber , 2012 ) . French team gather French Society Paediatric Oncology European consortium `` Innovative Therapies Children Cancer ( ITCC ) '' decide year ago perform biopsy tumours diagnostic confirmation ensure presence certain therapeutic target prior possible inclusion trial evaluate target therapy ( Geoerger , 2009 ; Geoerger , 2010 ) . Part experiment report team Necker Hospital Paris , confirm low rate complication stereotactic biopsy procedure ( Roujeau , 2007 ) . The biopsy specimen analysis allow practice immunohistochemical , genomic ( CGHarray ) , gene expression ( transcriptome ) direct sequence candidate gene study . In study , majority patient receive treatment assume specifically target biological abnormality identify biopsy . More importantly , patient receive drug identify target absent . In first step protocol , patient thus allocate one three treatment group follow : - If tumor overexpresses EGFR without PTEN loss expression , patient may receive erlotinib dasatinib allocate randomization ( R1 randomisation ) . - If tumor show loss PTEN expression without EGFR overexpression , patient may receive everolimus dasatinib allocate randomisation ( R2 randomisation ) . - If tumor show EGFR overexpression loss PTEN expression , patient may receive erlotinib , everolimus dasatinib randomisation ( R3 randomisation ) . - If tumor show neither EGFR overexpression loss PTEN expression ( rare situation experience ) , patient receive dasatinib ( randomisation ) . - If biopsy assessment contributive , treatment allocate randomisation erlotinib , everolimus dasatinib ( R3 randomisation ) .</brief_summary>
