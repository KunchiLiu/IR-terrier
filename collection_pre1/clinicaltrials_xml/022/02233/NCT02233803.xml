	<brief_summary>This Phase IV study multi-centre , randomise open label , two way cross-over design evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability NEUMOTEROL 400 subject asthma . The study use demonstrate non-inferiority Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate combination ( BFF ) 400/12 microgram ( mcg ) single capsule inhaler ( NEUMOTEROL 400 ) compare BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER® inhaler . The population study adult subject ( &gt; =18 &lt; =80 year ) diagnosis asthma pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) 40 % 85 % predict normal value , receive stable dose inhale corticosteroid inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist ( LABA ) prior screen . The study consist six phase : Prescreening , Screening/Run-in ( 4 week ) , Treatment Period 1 ( 4 week ) , Washout ( minimum 4 week ) , Treatment Period 2 ( 4 week ) Follow-up ( 1 week ) . The total duration study subject least 17 week . There 6 study visit follow-up telephone call . Pre-screening Visit allow subject recent asthma medication change stabilize prior Screening . During run-in wash-out period , subject receive budesonide dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) 400 mcg twice daily ( BID ) ( NEUMOTEX™ 400 ) salbutamol 100mcg pressurize meter dose inhaler ( pMDI ) demand , rescue medication . The dose NEUMOTEROL 400 ( 400/12 mcg ) SYMBICORT Forte ( 320/9 mcg ) one inhalation BID , treatment give subject 4 week ( 4-week Washout Period treatment ) . The study include 300 subject screen least 210 randomise minimum 168 subject complete study/are evaluable . Half subject Regimen A Treatment Period 1and cross Regimen B Treatment Period 2 , vice versa . Regimen A : BFF ( 400/12 mcg ) single capsule inhaler . Regimen B : BFF ( 320/9 mcg ) TURBUHALER inhaler . The treatment period separate washout Period 4 week .

Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . After confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ; Childbearing potential abstinent agree use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) start dose sufficiently minimise risk pregnancy point .
