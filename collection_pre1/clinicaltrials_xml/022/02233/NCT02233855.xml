	<brief_summary>Background : - Neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) cause tapeworm infect people . NCC lead serious brain problem seizure , sevre headache difficulty movement sensation limb . Researchers want learn different way people United States present disease respond standard new treatment . Objective : - To learn different form NCC occur throughout North America patient form respond treatment . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old NCC . Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history physical exam . - A computed tomography ( CT ) brain scan The participant lie still table slide large donut-shaped scanner . - Blood drawn arm vein analysis - A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain spine . They lay flat long metal cylinder machine make image body . During scan , participant receive contrast agent IV allow high resolution image brain spine - Participants visit clinic 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month ( 7 time ) , depend need monitoring , time . Participants receive schedule explain procedure do visit . - At visit , participant may : - Repeat screening procedure . - Be ask NCC symptom physical mental health . - Have urine test . - Take test ability concentrate , memory spatial recognition . - Have lumbar puncture , indicate state severity infection . A needle inserted skin space bone back . Cerebrospinal fluid remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) common helminthic CNS infection main cause adult-onset seizure low-to-middle income country . Studies document significant endemicity Latin America , Eastern Europe , sub-Saharan Africa , India part world . The prevalence NCC North America rise result increased migration people disease , occasionally , immigration individual asymptomatic tapeworm . Despite gain knowledge understand epidemiology , pathophysiology , diagnosis , treatment , clinical care continue hamper unanswered fundamental question relate optimal diagnosis , stag , treatment , follow-up patient NCC . This multi-center , natural history study seek characterize : frequency various form NCC North American population ; spectrum treatment management strategy across North American Cysticercosis Consortium ; response therapy evaluate number endpoint related disease evolution treatment , burden disease , cognitive change , radiographic change , treatment complication . This study inform future research study need eventually establish standardized management protocol form complex infection . Subjects visit screen , baseline , 1 , 2 ( optional ) , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month . Evaluations include assessment clinical status , antigen assay , radiographic imaging , functional assessment , immunologic evaluation , cognitive assessment , quality life measure . Additional clinically indicate visit may schedule need . This study provide interventional therapy collect data course treatment . Diagnostic examination , consultation medical treatment determine study clinician . Any sample remove medical indication relate NCC may evaluate research purpose .</detailed_description>

Fundoscopic examination ( subretinal parasite ) 2 . Major criterion 1 . Highly suggestive lesion neuroimaging 2 . Positive serum enzymelinked immunotransfer blot ( EITB ) assay 3 . Resolution intracranial cyst therapy 4 . Spontaneous resolution small single enhance lesion 3 . Minor criterion 1 . Compatible lesion neuroimaging 2 . Clinical manifestation suggestive NCC ( eg , headache , seizure , neurological symptom ) 3 . Positive CSF ELISA specific Ag/Ab 4 . Cysts outside CNS 4 . Epidemiological criterion 1 . Evidence household contact T. solium 2 . Individuals come from/living endemic area 3 . History frequent travel endemic area 5 . Single multiple characteristic calcification subject meet epidemiologic criterion ( 4 ) without another identifiable etiology consider NCC case calcify granulomas EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects opinion investigator contraindication participation study exclude , patient current substance abuse patient currently undergo cancer chemotherapy . Justification Exclusion Inclusion Special Populations Children Children eligible participate clinical trial enrol NIH NIH investigator see specialize pediatric population . In addition , NCC U.S. generally afflict traveler immigrant therefore exceedingly rare pediatric population U.S . Adults Unable To Provide Consent Patients offer standard care treatment deliver irrespective cognitive status , include lumbar puncture use clinical management decision determine site PI . Exclusion patient unable provide consent cognitive impairment would limit study population significantly , potentially compromise generalizability result observational study . In case cognitive function precludes inform consent seek consent designate legal guardian .</criteria>
