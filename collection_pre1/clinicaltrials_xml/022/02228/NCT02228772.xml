	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate combination drug consider standard treatment child young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , combination new drug call MLN 9708 . Additionally , study also evaluate bone marrow stem cell transplantation , give participant , help prevent ALL returning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study MLN 9708 Addition Chemotherapy Treatment Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In research study , investigator study optimal dose drug MLN 9708 give standard multi-drug regimen . In first part study , 18 participant enrol different dos MLN 9708 . Once maximally tolerate ( high , safe dose ) establish , additional 10 participant enrol . Additionally , bone marrow ( tissue find inside bone ) stem cell transplantation give participant study whether helps prevent ALL returning . The study treatment consist several different stage - Induction - Consolidation 1 - Or Stem Cell Bone Marrow Transplant ( eligible base medical condition availability match stem cell donor ) - Or If transplant : - CNS Therapy - Consolidation 2 - Continuation Therapy</detailed_description>
