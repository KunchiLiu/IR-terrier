	<detailed_description>The world population reach unprecedented seven billion , global population age increase great rate total population growth . Between 1998 2030 , proportion person age 65 year Singapore grow 3 % annually compare 1.0-1.3 % developed nation . Specific cognitive deficit like inattention , dysexecutive functioning , process speed decline may affect number quality life domain . Concurrent statistic , maintenance high possible level cognitive functioning long possible become important goal age successfully . To contribute realization goal propose conduct wait-list control trial examine efficacy brain-computer interface base intervention cognitive enhancement elderly . This intervention use technology analyzes brain wave capture electroencephalogram determine participant ' state attention . The training program develop use patent technology may useful individual experience difficulty memory sustain attention . This intervention may represent one alternative mean enhance cognitive ability slow cognitive decline normal elderly . If demonstrate efficacious , therapy may even help delay onset dementia . In addition , rate cognitive decline course AD possibly influence environmental also genetic factor . To date , several gene , apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) TOMM40 ( translocase outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homologue ) , identify probable genetic risk marker AD . These gene show play role disease onset well rate cognitive decline . For instance , study show APOEÎµ4 allele carrier associate earlier faster cognitive decline . Therefore , propose analyse relationship genetic profile participant performance training program . There publish study look cognitive training may associate change metabolism functional connectivity brain . Therefore , study also aim carry functional MRI brain training gain finer understanding change associate BCI-based cognitive training .</detailed_description>
