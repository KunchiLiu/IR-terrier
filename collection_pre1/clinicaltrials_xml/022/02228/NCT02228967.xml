	<brief_summary>An alcohol Screening , Brief Intervention Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) approach adapt use large military hospital setting , pilot test military emergency department ( ED ) assess potential effectiveness test large-scale trial . SBIRT `` opportunistic '' approach whereby adult patient ED screen Health Educators alcohol use , , take advantage `` teachable moment , '' deliver brief , motivational intervention match level risk . The feasibility/formative research activity first phase ( Phase I ) study summative research , therefore , lend testable hypothesis . Hypotheses regard pilot randomize trial Phase II follow : 1 . Participants SBIRT intervention show relatively great reduction six month period ( less increase ) brochure/usual care control group prevalence past-month heavy drinking , frequency heavy drinking , past week number drink , AUDIT-based drinker ' index . 2 . Alcohol use-related motivation/readiness change control drink self-efficacy show great change SBIRT intervention group relative brochure/usual care control group . In addition , exploratory analysis examine follow : 3 . Sociodemographic/military variable ( e.g. , age , race/ethnicity , gender , branch service , officer/enlisted status , PTS ) social-psychological factor ( e.g. , baseline readiness change , self efficacy ) mediate moderate change alcohol misuse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deployment frequency duration combat exposure implicate risk factor alcohol misuse PTSD among military personnel . During past 10 year , Department Defense healthcare system observe steep increase mental health substance use service among personnel demobilize conflict . Although alcohol Screening , Brief Intervention Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) approach show promise low-cost , effective strategy reduce alcohol use civilians many risky drinker yet dependent , adapt test military health care setting active duty personnel . This 2.5 year civilian-military collaborative study highly responsive explore solution emerge issue . The specific objective overall project give . Objective 1 : Feasibility Acceptability - Determine SBIRT intervention integrate standard military emergency department ( ED ) operation conduct record review observation ED . - Develop test acceptability usability ( ED staff potential participant ) SBIRT approach conduct focus group active duty personnel garner input ED staff . - Develop implementation/operations protocol deliver SBIRT ED . Objective 2 : Adaptation - Apply translational research approach adapt SBIRT implementation military setting population use information focus group input ED staff . - Adapt content SBIRT intervention relevant military personnel , include language image counsel material use information focus group input ED staff . Objective 3 : Pilot Trial - Using two group repeat measure design , assess impact SBIRT use standardized alcohol use measure assess potential effectiveness active duty military personnel ED setting . Specific methodology include : - Apply randomization method ED assign active duty participant experimental condition . - Implement SBIRT intervention ED assign intervention arm . - Implement process obtain follow-up data mobile population . - Assess presumed mediator ( e.g. , readiness/motivation change self-efficacy ) moderator ( e.g. , PTSD status , gender ) alcohol misuse change .</detailed_description>
