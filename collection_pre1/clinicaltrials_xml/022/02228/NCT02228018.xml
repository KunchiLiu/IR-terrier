	<brief_title>The Comparison Electronic Auscultation Coupled With CALSA FRI ; Repeatability FRI Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>study investigational product . CALSA compare FRI repeatability FRI parameter test group healthy volunteer asthma patient . Electronic auscultation respiratory sound perform , lung function test ( maximal dilatation ) execute compute tomography ( CT ) scan thorax take . The scan take two different breathing level , specifically total lung capacity ( TLC ) functional residual capacity ( FRC ) level . The scan take patient/ volunteer lie movable table CT-scan . After scan take asked patient/ volunteer sit upright scan table lie . When patient/ volunteer lie second CT-scan ( TLC FRC ) take . The objective study compare CALSA FRI ass repeatability FRI biomarkers</detailed_description>
