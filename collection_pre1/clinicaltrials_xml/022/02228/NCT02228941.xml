	<brief_summary>Hyper IgE syndrome ( HIES ) rare complex primary immunodeficiency affect multiple system . It characterize elevated Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) , recurrent skin pulmonary infection eczematoid dermatitis.Somatic manifestation include scoliosis , joint hyperextensibility , impair shed deciduous teeth facial dysmorphism . The reason extremely high level serum IgE patient HIES unknown . Signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) gene mutation cause STAT3/Janus kinase ( STAT3/JAK ) signal transduction pathway disorder , affect B cell development . It report level extracellular signal cytokine prolong half-life IgE cause dramatically increase IgE level STAT3-HIES patient . According preliminary work , find slight increase IgE-secreting plasma cell could explain tremendously increase IgE level key class switch recombination enzyme ( AID ) up-regulated STAT3-HIES patient . Intriguingly , find deregulation immunoglobulin class switch recombination ( CSR ) IgE secrete plasma cell STAT3-HIES patient might play key role dramatically increase IgE level . Nuclear factor IL-3 regulate ( NFIL3 ) newly discover transcriptional factor . During STAT3-HIES IgE-secreting plasma cell differentiate , NFIL3 significantly upregulated . The CSR IgE down-regulated STAT3-deficiency mouse well NFIL3-deficiency mouse , however Interleukin-4（IL-4） , STAT3-independent cytokine , promote NFIL3 expression Signal transducer activator transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) dependent manner . Thus , hypothesize NFIL3 may play key role dramatically increase IgE level STAT3-HIES patient . In-depth insight pathogenic role NFIL3 within human STAT3-HIES great significance clarify pathogenesis HIES exploit effective target intervention improve clinical outcome . Also , provide valuable clue clinical treatment IgE-related disease , parasite infection malignant disease .</brief_summary>
